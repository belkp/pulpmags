  god-fearing men of gloucester all native
or adopted up on newfoundlands french
shore for cod in bale verte with their trap
they listened to the prayer of the reverend
lance the itinerant missionary of this vast
fore shore dropped aboard by night from
his church yacht star of the sea

  up-standing straight in his ministerial
black by the long table that ran from the
sharp angle of the graywings bows to her
stout foremast his spectacles glittering over
short-sighted eyes and his purged face
haloed by the yellow light of the oil lantern
he was concluding his short service with a
benediction giving them the peace of god
and asking his protection for them while
they seined the deep under menace of
storm and fog and reef and berg

  quick with an oath in anger with a fist-
blow in a brawl they were nevertheless
each according to his breed inherently
religious and to lances benediction they
chorused sonorous amen as into the
eyes of god they had looked overlong into
the depths of the sea and the omnipotence

of its creation had bound them with
stronger bonds than any landsmens creed
or sect

  swift to devotion swifter perhaps to
action the captains finger of warning
dropped for his lookout hughie hay and
hughie himself a fresh-faced auburn-
haired lump of a gloucester lad with the
glowing cheeks of a woman and the wise
gray eyes of a child went on to announce
the news he had carried down the ladder

  he sprang from his bunk as he spoke and
rushed for the ladder yelling for his men to
follow

  tumble up boys he exhorted out
of the way hughie-ill go first oh yes-
lance come on if you want to

chapter ii

the freighter auk

taylor was up the ladder and on deck
with amazing agility for one of such
great frame and on his heels tumbled
hughie and all the crew with the reverend
lance hastily ascending in the rear

  from the deck of the graywing the
captain looked out across the heaving
strait of belle isle across the green-blue
waters streaked with frozen froth jeweled
with pale-emerald floating ice and overlaid
with the mother-of-pearl of a rising moon
southeastward between him and belle isle
island wrapped ghost-like in atlantic fog
yawed the freighter hughie hay had
sighted not an ocean-going cargo steamer
but a sixty-ton schooner carrying labrador
stationers to their summer fishing-stations

  too poor to own their own schooners
the stationers were freighted down the
coast to their rooms every spring and
herded up again like cattle in the autumn
on vessels belonging to the firm with which
they dealt

  yonder she is the captain pointed out
to reverend lance and a fine little
plague-ship for your ministering lance
the foaming fore shore



  what ship is it demanded lance
peering short-sighted over the shimmering
sea

  the auk over from bay of islands on
newfoundland taylor told him be-
longs to old peter laval and doing business
from chateau to chidley

  hm hm laval eh one of my best
church supporters commented lance

  sanctimonious old whelp corrected
taylor good heavens his old wagon
will ruin my eight-hundred-dollar cod trap
wheres the french fishery cruiser
wheres admiral pellier and his groix

  yaonder offn york point capn
spoke hughie hay

  he pointed where almost invisible be-
hind a jumble of low icebergs deep azure
in the shadows the long black hulk of the
fishery protection service cruiser lay at
anchor together with the admirals private
yacht esperance which he used as an
auxiliary vessel for shore work round the
harbors

  then why isnt he on his job de-
manded taylor who had run foul of pellier
several times on his newfoundland voyages
and who had at last been definitely warned
off the french shore if i happen to
dry a seine taut in the sun hes after me
for the size of my mesh but lavals blunder-
ing auk here can-by the tall pole star
look theres no one at her wheel weve
got to board her

  swiftly he sprang to take his own wheel
beckoning the regular wheelsman brown
to his side and at the same time calling
orders to his men who swift as he ran up
the big mainsail and backed over the jib

  no time for dories boys he warned
have to jump her rail as we go by brown
grab this wheel when i say and you
bolero fall to and handle the sheets for
brown when he comes about on the other
tack

  under taylors guidance the graywing
caught her stride headsails ballooning
fore and main booms crashing across as
she leaped toward the yawing auk not three
cable-lengths away the freighter swung
drunkenly to starboard taylor veered
a point or two in his course and as swiftly
as silently and as smoothly as a knife skirts
a pot of grease he skirted her rail and
barked to brown at his elbow

  browns hands fell upon the spokes
taylors hands left and taylor with a

running jump vaulted the rails of the
graywing and auk as a double hurdle
hughie hay irish kerrigan boston jim
patterson scotty mccaig and tom halifax
were over the hurdle with him with him
they landed upon the cluttered deck of
the auk and as they heaved themselves
up out of the amazing muddle of things
that burdened the freighter they found to
their surprise the reverend lance in their
midst

  you here too lance grinned taylor
havent lost your college legs yet eh
well maybe youll need your college fists
ss well looks like a free-for-all fight and
lots of unsavory facts-but steady boys
o mine steady we have to handle the
schooner you see before we handle her
crew lower the heavy canvas-yes both
of them fore and main

   he himself grasped the freighters kicking
wheel and quickly brought her to under
jumbo alone

  then with a rush he and his men jumped
away from the canvas-billowcd booms and
dived down among the struggling mass that
glutted the auk below decks

chapter iii

the flower of the coast

 a fine little floating plague-ship eh
lance was taylors war-cry as he
went smiting right and left into the packed
rabble that would have made a full passen-
ger list for a five-hundred-ton coasting
steamer

  being of only sixty tons the auk had
no space below to boast of and what space
she had was crammed to the last inch so
that taylor and his crew could get no
footing at first but rode upon the hips and
backs and shoulders of men in their effort
to smash an opening in the jam

  according to the custom of freighters
the auks hold was first spread with a layer
of unbreakable cargo a second layer of
traps nets and seines overspread this
while upon the bed of twine rested the
bunks of the stationers with their gear
in bags boxes and barrels sheering in
pyramids to the deck overhead

  here they herded eating and sleeping
in cramped unsanitary quarters carrying
on a travesty of cooking by turns at the
tiny galley or bolting their food raw


adventure

nothing but make-shift sailcloth partitions
screened the womens bunks from the mens
in the melee these partitions had been tom
away and shrieking women and girls in
various stages of dishabille were mael-
stromed in the swaying horde that trampled
their bunks under foot and sent the tiers
of boxes and barrels toppling on their
heads

  under the showering ruin they huddled
in the dancing light of the smoky lanterns
raising hopeful eyes at the coming of the
graymngs crew and one young girl
crouching for shelter at the foot of the mast
flung out her arms in appeal to taylor in
the lead

  ah mon americain-mon americain
she cried

  white as a lily she gleamed in the un-
washed horde her delicate beautifully-
chiseled oval face terror-bleached till it
seemed carved from ivory over the
tapered curves of her half-bare shoulders
where her enfolding cloak lay low on her
neck over her forehead patricianly high
her hair was tossed in a tangle like silken
floss and through the golden net her great
eyes flashed out eyes violet-blue as the
tint of labrador ice in shadow as the
water-heart of a lonely cliff-walled lab-
rador fiord-such eyes as a man may see
but once in a thousand miles of labrador
coast

  ah mon americain-vitel she appealed
in a voice like the silver lapping of the
summer waves mon americain-vitel

  great heavens exclaimed taylor in-
voluntarily as he struggled toward her
who in the name of the mermaids is she

  marie laval-the flower of the coast
they call her spoke the voice of lance at
his shoulder you know old peter hes
her father

  but-but how is it ive never seen her
before panted taylor knocking men this
way and that in his effort to reach her

  shes been schooling at st johns i
guess shes through this summer i re-
member now old peter told me he was going
to take her on the stations yonders old
peter behind her-and her mother old
anne both too fond of their smuggled
brandy taylor if i do say it with a clerical
tongue cant you smell it in the air a
perfect reek and i shouldnt be at all sur-
prised at this bedlam i know peters
brandy has been the cause

  and thats their daughter marveled
taylor the flower of the coast yes-
a flower in the slime quick boys o mine
get the women up on deck

  drunkenly clinging to the mast behind
marie he had full glimpse of her parents
in his rush old anne brown-faced brown-
eyed as a gipsy fat ungainly in slovenly
galoshes tubbed-up skirt and greasy head-
shawl covering her oiled black hair from
which gold ear-rings peeped old peter in
worn hip boots and oilskins his yellow
toothless face lighted by cold colorless
icicle-like eyes and by strange anomaly
shaven bare except for a narrow snow-
white fringe of whisker that rimmed it from
ear to ear under his drooping southwester

  he glimpsed them unconsciously noting
every characteristic every detail but his
thought was only of marie and jamming
swaying bodies apart with his shoulders
and knees he forced an opening and gath-
ered her pliant body into his arms

  merci mon americain-merci mon vik-
ing she half-laughed half-sobbed in im-
petuous gratitude i had the fear of
death under those stamping heels but
voild i knew you would come when i
called

  ha my flower of the coast breathed
taylor as he fought his way on deck with
her could i leave such a flower as you
in the slime

chapter iv

admiral pellier and the esp era ncr

t ehind taylor breaking into the cool
night air upon the chaotic deck came
lance guiding the stumbling peter and
anne up the ladder by the arms while after
lance with tugging and shouting hughie
hay irish kerrigan boston jim patterson
scotty mccaig and tom halifax heaved
the women to safety

  as taylor straightened himself up on the
auks deck he saw through the black snarl
of her mainsheets the wings of another
schooner all silver in the moonlight

  brown he yelled taking it at first
for the graywing brown-but hold on
its not my schooner its the espcrance

  oui the esperance and quite at your
service capilaine taylor spoke an even
voice from the stern of the auk

  taylor wheeled and stared through the
the foaming fore shore



amazing litter of boats oars buoys and
fishers paraphernalia that covered the
vessel from bow- to stern a boat full of
men was moored to the rail and three
boarding figures cast long inky shadows
across the afterdeck

  instantly taylor recognized the figures
that cast the shadows pellier of the groix
his well-knit body and military shoulders
filling his commanding admirals uniform
his close-clipped brown beard touched silver
by the moon and his keen brown eyes far-
focused from their constant sea-ranging
burning out under the peak of his cap
jacques beauport boyish midshipman of
the groix likewise in uniform dark-eyed
swarthy-skinned with the stealthy reserve
of a heart unfathomable stamped on his
breton face and codroy john pelliers
skipper of the esperance a gigantic bearded
newfoundlander dressed in moleskin trou-
sers and canvas jacket with a rugged
craggy face and deep blue eyes prophetic
as the eyes of a seer

  at your service capitaine taylor
repeated pellier and what is the trouble
this time i would like to know

  none of my making but yours for the
tending answered taylor gruffly
though ive done half the job for you
there was a drunken fight below and we
got the lavals and all the women out for
fear of their being trampled

  dieu-the lavals exclaimed pellier
leaning forward and staring at old peter
and anne in the moonlight

  his eyes switched to the face of the girl
taylor held and the gloucester captain
saw him start and draw up his shoulders
more rigidly

  then in that case pellier went on
rapidly in a voice official in its intonation
i shall put them ashore in my boat while
my men restore order in the auks hold
jacques codroy john tell them i am
aboard and let that still their tongues or
they will be taken in charge

  jacques beauport and codroy jbhn dived
below and taylor could hear them yelling
above the din beauports shrill staccato
cries spacing codroy johns booming roar

  stinking cod-hunters valid will you-
revel in the cells at st johns listen
makers of a thousand smells-the admiral
himself is on your cluttered deck oui
admiral pellier of the groixl

  aye in codroys bass id like to die

if he baint a stench ye be in the nose
o the lard ye fools a powerful lot o
breakers o newfoundland navigation laws
runnin a vessel wild like this back to yer
bunks or yell lose yer voyage and face the
admiralty court at st johns

  under the threat and the warning of
pelliers nearness the tumult died down
below decks and pellier himself waved old
peter and anne meek as whipped curs
into the esperances waiting boat

  you too marie-quickly he begged
anxious to retrieve as far as possible an
awkward situation

  marie hesitated her violet-blue eyes
meeting taylors for a moment in the moon-
glow before she slipped out of his protecting
grip

   au revoir vion viking i will thank you
better when i can she whispered as she
glided after her father and mother

  with an odd feeling that somehow he
had been robbed of the fruits of liis efforts
below taylor watched the black boat
streaking off to the esperance

   marie pellier called her he exclaimed
turning slowly to lance so the admiral
knows her as well as the parents-knows
her that well

   lance nodded confidentially

   knows her well he coincided and he
would marry her in a moment if she would
speak the word but there hers is the
heart of a maid with a score of suitors
among whom jacques beauport and his
commander are chief the heart of a maid
taylor and an impulsive heart at that
you know how they are she wont pledge
herself to the admiral much less to beau-
port though old peter and anne urge and
threaten and scheme do you think her
beautiful captain

  the most beautiful girl on the fore
shore admitted taylor without hesitation
but is she-is she-well lance i cant
bring myself to say it of a girl like her but
you know what some of the women on
these cursed freighters are dont you
again lance nodded seriously regret-
fully his face all thoughtful lines in the
moonlight

  that i do he confessed and my
protest based on this specific case goes
to the government tonight but not
marie i can take an oath under heaven
on that marie is pure as the heart of an
iceberg is pure a victim of nothing but


adventure

circumstances taylor-that and unsavory
parents hello-theres another schooner
abeam of the esperance is it your gray-
uring coming about my eyes fail me in
the dazzle of the moon
i taylor looked up and gave an affirmative
shake of his head

  the graywing boys o mine he
announced to his clustering crew bor-
row some of the auks dories for a minute
and well row back to the schooner

chapter v

hauling the trap

in the blaze of the rainbow dawn across
the glittering facades of the scores of
scattered icebergs the graywing hove to
by taylors trap berth in the strait and
seven of the eight dories dropped overside

  ever quick to progress it was the ameri-
cans themselves that had introduced seines
into the haunts of the cod in place of
the ancient method of taking the fish by
hook and line or jigger captain norman
of brigus had brought the cod-trap down
on the labrador no longer men with the
ready money to purchase a trap bothered
with the hook and line or jigger or puttered
with the trawl

  with the great seines rich harvests were
drawn from the icy deep and taylor
himself on more than one occasion had
gathered an even hundred quintals at one
haul of the customary two hauls a day
this was the lucky morning haul and with
song and shout the graywings crews in
the dories raced expectantly for the moor-
ings of their berth

  dead ahead of them shining blood-red
upon the sapphire sea bobbed the four
anchored buoys that buoyed the corners
of the vast square-topped bag of meshed
twine the bag itself invisible in the
watery depths of the strait was open at
the top its edges full fifty feet to the side
supported by long lines of cork floats
streaking from buoy to buoy

  from one corner branched a leader a
single wall of net that walled the belle isle
currents across and inveigled up or down-
swimming fish into a funnel-like opening
in the trap once in they never found
the small end of the funnel again but swam
imprisoned round and round their huge
elastic cell

  underrunning the agitated edges of the
trap the seven dories sculled in place and
laying aside their oars the seven rowers
seized the floating edges of the pound
standing up to their work swaying to the
heave of the swell through the strait
timing their pull to a fishermans chanty
they hauled their trap lusty giants reaping
their finny harvest as fishers of all ages
ever since the day of peter have cast forth
their nets and harvested the sea

  heaving thus in the sudden glare of
golden sunlight etched starkly against
the round blue hills of the atlantic beyond
every man stood out his individuality fixed
like a row of cleanly-sculptured bronze
statues poised against the azure sky the
viking taylor the adolescent hughie hay
the expectorating irish kerrigan the par-
son-like boston jim the lopped-off titan
patterson the braw mccaig the battered
sealer halifax

  to the drone of their chanty they pursed
and pursed the trap rising and falling
heaving and holding quivering there in a
web of striking color color of indigo ocean
crimson buoy green-painted dory sun-
gilded oilskins diamond-dewed net-a
blood-pulsing picture all vivid as a startling
seascape hung upon dun walls

  lustily they heaved and lustily they sang

  and in the center of the picture rimmed
round by the dripping scintillating net
that sagged with the weight of its catch
boiled a maelstrom of quicksilver the
packed cod mobile twenty-pounders lash-
ing furiously as they were pocketed tightly
in a solid mass

  by the ribs o sunken spanish galleons
cried irish kerrigan at the sight yeve
topped wan hundred quintal this toime
capten

  that she is men-an a quarter

aint it a record for the coast

  i believe you patty beamed boston
jim i reckon one hundred and ten was
all-

  but the rest of their calculations was lost
in taylors roar

  alongside brown he bellowed freeing
one bronzed hand and waving it to the
wheelsman of the graywing who with the
exception of the cuban cook bolero was
the only man left aboard walk her up
in a hurry

  right-o capn twanged brown in
the foaming fore shore



acknowledgment araound an araound

  holding hard they could see bolero dive
like a dark snake for the jib to back it over
could mark brown give and take his spokes
with sureness and serenity and almost
before taylors waving hand returned to
its grip on the net the silver-gray schooner
graceful as a gull breasted lightly down on
the dories

chapter vi

chateau the storied

hat livers to fry gasped bolero
at sight of the prize haul

  he took the brown cigar from his teeth
and wiggled it exultingly then he and
brown jumped snappily to the rail to handle
the dory tackles

  sluice them on deck-quick urged
taylor sag enough here to unjoint a
mans arms

  bolero and brown hooked on and swiftly
swung outboard the dip-net rigged on a
pulley up and down the splattering dip-
net plunged in a silver stream the cod
were scooped inboard all alive and flopping
in the pen and while the dories leaving
taylor aboard sheered off again to reset
the empty trap brown and bolero hastened
to spread the splitting-tables amidships

  never mind boys taylor stopped
them im not salting these down im
taking them in to chateau to be made
ashore

  without a wink of surprise bolero and
brown desisted bolero going off imme-
diately to his tiny galley and brown taking
his accustomed place at the wheel they
made no comment then but when the
dories were nested aboard once more and
sail crowded on the graywing the crew had
opportunity to pass the word as the schooner
headed inshore

  aye an tis made fish ashore theyll
be ye ken winked scotty mccaig to
halifax an for why are the cod
nae plentiful an this the first week o june
octobers a lang way aheid tammy

  old peter lavals room prophesied

  wing and wing the speed of a water-
witch in her rakish beautiful lines taylor
himself in browns place at the wheel the
grayvnng drove on for chateau bay the
grandest fiord on labradors southern
fore shore past york point its western
entrance she tacked raising the sheer
basaltic cliff of the devils dining table
capping henley island and fluttered on
through the cove-like harbor of chateau
itself

  rimmed round by towering laurentian
hills covered with birch balsam and spruce
snuggling at the foot of beacon hill the
hoary thousand-foot sentinel of all spread
the ancient storied settlement here tay-
lor knew jacques cartier in  had first
set down his wandering foot on the shores
of his la nouvelle france

  here was the founding of his first settle-
ment of french colons that grew by the
hundreds to be swelled in the middle of
the seventeenth century by bold breton
emigrants to be further augmented a full
century later by exiled acadians who in
 located at matashquan and inevitably
drifted in to chateau till it hived in its
present glory of swarming population and
hummed with the ceaseless industry of the
fishing

  the industry of the fishers was the blood
and fiber of the place newfoundland mer-
chants marketed the catch and of the
several firms doing business there peter
laval secured the bulk of the trade of
all the old-time dealers slave-masters of
the outports and rogues and hypocrites at
heart taylor acknowledged old peter the
peer

  no more skilful hand than old peters
to cull a fishermans voyage and grade it
for his profit as damp or madeira

  no swifter pencil than old peters to
charge the planters double prices for sup-
plies and carry on his books without interest
their balancc at the settling upl

adventure

  no nor no greater pride than peters
when sober nor no deeper devotion as a
pillar of the church he sat in the front pew
and prayed for his delinquent livyeres in
the seats behind him

  and lastly no more sordid coiner of
mens and womens lives into terranovan
dollars as evidenced in his custon of working
women as cheaper labor than men upon his
labrador stations

chapter vii

old peters room

lavals establishment lay in the curve
j of the cove below the village graveyard
sleeping under the slant of beacon hill
it consisted of a long wooden jetty a barn-
like supply store generally known as the
barter-house miserable tumble-down fish-
sheds and a disgraceful room sod-thatched
and rough-boarded on unbarked studs

  up and down the jetty stalked old peter
his keen colorless icicle-like eyes over-
seeing everything that went on and at the
same time watching the crowded shipping
of the harbor

  what have you there capuaine tay-
lor he cried as the grayuring swung to
anchor of his wharf a trap haul for me
perhaps

  aye peter a record haul of one hundred
and twenty-five quintals for a trap of that
size all alive and kicking yours at the
current figure proffered taylor and no
damp or madeira about them-no nor any
miquelon brandy either

  peter grinned a deep grin that wrinkled
his sanctimonious face

  voild i was drunk last night but i
am sober and penitent today he declared
piously oui and the auk is many souls
lighter and gone on her way to camp
islands it would have been a pity to drag
a hole through a bag like that my room
is ready capuaine and ill send the carteel
boat out for your fish no you cant
moor alongside till i get the harbor-end
of my jetty in place comment you
know how much there was to do

  peter stumped down the wharf to give his
orders and immediately the carteel boat
a long fish-barge used to freight the catches
from the fishing-grounds to the rooms
put out in charge of homespun-jacketed
livyeres the morning haul of the gray-

wing was dumped in and conveyed across
the harbor taylor himself riding his own
dory trailed by the carteel boat with the
livyeres and the graywings men aboard
in to old peters stage

  as he approached the straddling skeleton
of the stage which was built of longers he
scanned it for the first glimpse of the
roomies laval was working surely tay-
lor thought with all his riches hard-fisted
though he was old peter would hardly
work his own womenkind in a room like
this surely he would not-by jove yes
he would too yonder was the slim sway-
ing of a figure he had seen before

  three laden dories ahead of the carteel
boat were pewing the last of their loads to
the stage and there in the stagehead
position stood marie passing the gleaming
cod along a chute to the cutthroat old anne
her double-bladed knife flashing in the
sunlight old anne in two strokes nicked
each fish on either side of the neck with a
third slash ripped each belly open and
slung the mangled carcass along to the
header

  the header was a quarter-breed eskimo
woman leathered wrinkled impressive as
a buddha who pulled heads off and en-
trails out separated the livers with won-
derful dexterity dropped each liver into
the liver puncheon and slid the disem-
boweled fish on for the final operation of
splitting

  thesplitter a full-blooded montagnais
squaw with one hand mittened boned the
cod with three lightning slashes and slapped
them into a large vat whence her fourteen-
year-old boy wheeled them in a dredge
barrow away to the fish-sheds to lie a month
under salt in layers three deep before being
dried

it was an efficient crew of roomies
old peter worked from stage to
salt bulk there was no pause in the
glittering stream of cod-not till the carteel
boat with the trailing dory swung up to
the wharf and marie raised her eyes to look
fairly into taylors

  mon dieul she gasped

  taylor shuddered inwardly at sight of
her slim loveliness in the ugly mess but he
carried himself boldly in the awkward
moment

  good morning mademoiselle marie
he greeted seeming not to see the smatter
the foaming fore shore

ii

and slime i have brought your father
a trap haul to handle for me

  bon matin capitaine taylor she
returned swiftly recovering herself you
must be a mighty fisher

  but her involuntary halt in her work had
balked the rapid machine the pitch-
forked fish piled up on her the cutthroat
old anne and the rest waved idle knives
in the air and old peter let out a roar like
a bull

  name of a name marie he bellowed
do not stand there like a rock pillar with
a dozen quintal of fish at your feet diable
move them along

  marie flushed scarlet her face like some
rare delicate crimson flower among the
silver gleam of the cod and taylor saw
the fire leap to her eyes as she shot a wicked
side-glance at her father taylor himself
had only one thought-to get her out of
that mess but he was too shrewd to try
to bully old peter or to appeal to his better
nature laval was not a man to be bullied
or influenced by appeals to move him
one had to speak in terms of his pocket-
book

  but look peter he argued your
marie is too slight for such rush work
i have a big trap haul here and very likely
another coming by evening let me put
one of my own men in her place let me
put hughie hay here as good a stagehead
as ever kept the dories forking it is in
my own interest and with hughie on the
stage it will be better for you as well
but the pay demurred old peter
marie gets nothing for wild it is the
return she gives me for her st johns
schooling

  hughie gets his wage and share as one of
the graywings crew whether afloat or
ashore taylor hastened to assure him
he will cost you nothing

  tris bien then let him take maries
place accepted old peter with alacrity

  hughie sprang out and took the girls
position as stagehead while marie turned
to taylor a wonderful light of gratitude
in her eyes he had extricated her quickly
and neatly from her demeaning bondage
without touching her pride and she was
not loath to let him see that she admired
his delicacy

  ah mon viking of the auk how can i
thank you she breathed gratefully yet
with something of coquettishness

  why by taking hughies place aboard
the graywing laughed taylor

  with a touch of gallantry he handed her
down into his dory under old peters icicle-
like but unprotesting eyes

  the schooner has nothing to do till the
trap haul this evening so till then ill just
take you for a holiday cruise round
chateau bay

chapter viii

unlawful mesh

and what a cruise and what a holiday
it was and what a respite for marie
-the clean deck of the trim graywing
under her feet in place of the slimy stage
the savory sea breeze in her nostrils in lieu
of the reek of disemboweled cod the laugh-
ing voice of this great viking of a sea
captain in her ears instead of the snarling
admonitions of her parental slave-masters
old peter and old anne

  care-free buoyant joyful-mooded as the
sparkling sea itself they poked the
schooners bowsprit into all the inner
harbors of chateau bay into henley into
antelope tickle into pitts arm they
climbed the devils dining table to glimpse
the sail-dotted panorama of the strait and
finally brought up at evening in crimson-
cliffed red bay twenty miles to the west-
ward

  truly a day of comradeship of con-
fidences exchanged of romance exotically
blossoming forth upon a romantic shore a
shore steeped in lore and legend and storied
in love and feud here in the beginning the
eskimos and montagnais wooed and
warred to be followed in peace and con-
flict by the english and french and later
the northward-voyaging americans and
blood of these ancient coastwise adventurers
ran in the veins of both taylor and marie

  yonder ruin of fort pitt in pitts arm
almost obliterated by the willow shrub-
bery-well taylors father was one of the
officers of the american privateer minerva
which besieged it in  that old
tumble-down fortress fort greville to the
northward of henley island over there-
voild few knew anything about it but marie
could tell her granduncle on her mothers
side old greville the planter had built
it to keep the warlike eskimos away from
his breton colons


adventure

  such bonds and grounds of intimacy
they discovered by the score throughout the
day the day had been a blazing jewel
topaz-clear and diamond-bright but at
evening a sulfur-colored mist came in from
the atlantic and the wind began to rise

  a dirty squall cornin capn
prophesied tom halifax

  youre right tom agreed taylor
and wed better haul our trap and get in
to the shelter of chateau before it blows
any worse

  accordingly the slim boston jim as
lookout the battered sealer halifax re-
lieving brown at the wheel they bore away
through the yellowish mist for their trap-
berth near york point

  sight the buoys boston demanded
taylor as the schooner fleet as the wind
itself flitted ghostlike from fog bank to
fog bank

  aye captain i reckon i have their
range this minute boston jim sang out
aye in an open patch i have them but
theres a schooner lyin off it aye and a
dory underrunnin the floats luks like
somebody helpin themselves to our fish
while he sang out boston jim lost sight
of the trap berth but plunging through a
fog bank half a mile wide the graywing
soared once more into a clear water space
not two cable-lengths from the trap
riding the clear space her topsails wreathed
in the scud that blew high overhead like
smoke taylor recognized the esperance
admiral pelliers auxiliary vessel with
her skipper codroy john in charge in
the lowered dory that was underrunning
his floats he saw jacques beauport and
admiral pellier himself not hauling as
boston jim had suspected but evidently
inspecting the mesh of the net

  with a growl in his throat taylor barked
tart orders to his men and folding her
wings like a gull alight his schooner lay to
alongside the esperance

  what in blazes does this mean pellier
he roared at the dory in a mighty wrath
who gave you authority to touch that net
the law capiiaine taylor pellier sent
back jacques beauport brought word to
the groix in the harbor that you were
using two-and-one-half-inch mesh and i
came out to seize your trap

  then jacques beauport is a cursed liar
and you are a plagued fool to believe any
tale he brings taylor raged i hauled

that trap just this morning the mesh
was the lawful three-inch then and it hasnt
shrunk since

      taylor wheeled in his fury to
      grasp the boat tackles and slam a
      dory overside

  ill put pellier and beauport back on
the deck where they belong in one blazing
minute he promised marie

  but let me go too she begged and
dropped into the dory with him as the boat
rose upon the swell im going too
there was a net seized in chateau harbor
this morning antoine lefevres so my
father said-oui and a two-and-one-half-
inch mesh if you please could it be sub-
stitution capitaine that jacques is a
dark one when he has a grudge maybe
he has taken up your own set lefevres
to catch you and brought the admiral to
see

  by heavens if he has ill brain him
vowed taylor

  with a surge he drove the dory along
the line of floats toward the other craft
rowing so viciously that beauport held up
a warning hand

  its no use making such a pretty fuss
capitaine he warned we have the
size of your mesh oui ask codroy john
there whom any man well knows does
not lie two and one-half is it not codroy
john

  aye it be two and one-half boomed
codroy john from the deck of the esper-
ance id like to die if it do measure a
twine-breadth more

  taylor seized the floats and hauled in a
few feet of the net

  its not my trap he vehemently de-
clared its not the trap i hauled in this
spot this morning my own has been
lifted and this one dropped in its place
mon dieu a fine fairy-story chortled
pellier buoyed by your buoys but not
your net eh ho ho that is a new
plea for law-breakers

  no its not my net gritted taylor
my buoys but not my trap

  then whose is it pray scoffed pellier
antoine lefevres most likely flashed
marie and capitaine taylors is most
likely stored away where it will not be found
ask jacques beauport there he was the
man who seized it this morning and-and
used it again
the foaming fore shore



  pelliers eyes turned inquiringly on
jacques

  ciell exploded jacques the fire flaming
in his eyes do you and your yankee
capitaine insinuate that i-that i-

  yes cut in taylor you exchanged
them either on your own or some one elses
bidding

  beauport choked his swarthy face
reddish-purple in his rage

  canaille-canaille fils du diablel
he anathematized nomme de-

  taylors swinging oar stopped short his
epithets pellier and jacques had just
time to duck low before the swishing spruce
blade scarred their dory gunwale and
before they could raise their heads anew
or seize a weapon taylor bringing his
bludgeon round in its arc again stove their
whole bow with a terrific blow

  pellier and beauport floundered in the
water yelling for help from the esperance
and taylor looked up to find the schooner
footing forward under sail at the first
sign of altercation codroy john had slipped
her in between the schooner graywing and
the two dories at the trap taylor and
marie were cut off from their vessel and it
seemed for a moment that the esperances
crew might seize him in the name of the law
along with his trap

  but his own crew on the graywing were
likewise watchful they moved when cod-
roy john moved cracking on full sail in
the howling squall so that the schooner
leaped across the foamy wave-crests out-
pointed the esperance and drew a length
clear

  then swinging on her heel the graywing
came about on the other tack threatening
to shave the esperances bows as she
crossed the auxiliary vessels course

  tom halifax was yelling codroy john
warning to alter his course but codroy
refused to shift a point his aim was to
blanket the dory seize its two occupants
pick up the pair of floundering men and
drive on before the graywing could give
taylor any aid

  all right then ill bump your old
wagon bellowed tom

  he cut fairly across the esperances bows
there was the high-pitched whine of taut
chafing sheets the sullen grind of timbers
a medley of cries and a volley of oaths in
french and the next moment the gray-
wings bowsprit crashed out the esperances

foremast in a trailing jumble of wreckage

  the big foresail sagging overside held
her like a sea-anchor while the graywing
swept clear and apparently unharmed
luffed up in the gale of wind

  taylor heaving his dory alongside with
his one undamaged oar rose on the crest
of a wave kerrigan and patterson wait-
ing tackles in hand hooked on and brought
him marie dory and all on deck with a
run

  weve lost our trap and well lose our
schooner too if we dont get to shelter
taylor shouted the moment he struck the
deck crack on all youve got and run
into chateau

even as he spoke tom halifaxs
cry rose above the howl of the
wind

   ware the mainmast yon rough work
must a cracked her look out shes foulin
the fore boom

  taylor wheeled to see the main boom
poised weirdly in air with the mainmast
sagging on to the foremast and adding its
windage in a terrific strain

  axes boys o mine he yelled jump
lively there

  but as the swinging blades of half a dozen
of the crew hit into the tangle the added
windage told the foremast gave sud-
denly with an explosive snap and both
masts and both booms with their ballooning
sails crashed over the starboard rail

  the graywing heeled till the rail went
under it seemed for a second that she
would never rise out of the trough of the
seas but taylor with a warning word to
marie to hold tight rushed away from her
with an ax snatched from the hand of one
of his men he sprang upon the slanting
stump of the foremast at the same time
yelling orders in the tumult of the breaking
seas

  cut her clear boys o mine he clar-
ioned his bright blade cleaving in a circle
of light about his head

  it was wild work in a wall of spray for
a moment and marie caught her breath
her eyes on taylor like a true viking in
storm or boarding clinging to the stump
of the foremast his fair head steel-haloed
by his ax hurling the wreckage adrift
while the wind rose bringing with it the
menace of floe-ice hurtling down the
esperance in as bad a plight as they


adventure

threatened every moment to drift down on
them her crew had hauled pellier and
beauport aboard and were cutting their own
wreckage free when the graywing slowly
righted and marie drew her breath again

  men dieu that was dangerous she
gasped

  all over now cried taylor

  laughing like the viking he was he
sprang back to her side as the foremast
stump assumed a vertical position again and
slid him back on to the deck

 rig a couple of trysails on those
stumps he ordered a wary eye on the
esperance all clear and hard abeam

  like magic the emergency sails fluttered
on and drew the stumps of fore and main
like two dwarfed jury masts and craftily
swept continually by the baffled sea the
graywing crept from the menace of wave
and wind and floe into the quiet of chteau
harbor hard in her wake the esperance
snailed in under similar rig and for an
instant the two vessels rode rail to rail
before rounding to their anchorage off
peter lavals long jetty

  well pellier shouted taylor this
is what comes of beauports trickery a
nice mess its made of two fine schooners
youd better look to the whereabouts of
your men after this

  pellier staring at taylor with his far-
focused brown eyes as the gloucester
captain lowered a dory and prepared to
row marie ashore answered not a word
but when the dory touched old peters
wharf the admiral beckoned jacques beau-
port to him and closeted himself with him
in the esperances cabin

chapter ix

the toast

the dark was down on shore as taylors
dory touched old peters wharf the
soaring crests of the wooded hills lost in
the black murk of a stormy sky the cheery
fights of chateau pricking like golden stars
through the scudding fog about peters
room burned evil-smelling kerosene flares
one on the stagehead one at the cutthroats
stall and one at the splitters table in the
faint glow of the farther flare worked the
montagnais squaw splitting the last of the
days catch her fourteen-year-old boy
coming and going beside her as he had done

since dawn his dredge barrow bumping
and squeaking dolefully in the night

  at the splitters table old anne was
cleaning her knives on a wad of tow
whetting them keen and sticking them in
the slabs ready for the morrow while on
the stagehead the final fish shot away
hughie hay leaned on his fork beside old
peter and stared in a vain attempt to make
out the strange rigs of the schooners that
had just cast anchor

  mon dieu it is you two then cried
old peter as taylor and marie climbed out
on the stage what have you done to
your graywing capitaine we couldnt
see well for the fog but i know it is not the
rig you sailed out under this morning

  no i had a brush with pelliers esper-
ance and we both lost some sticks laughed
taylor

 diablet you tell me so come into
the lean-to and let us hear about it

 with a word to hughie hay to take
charge of the dory and wait for him taylor
followed old peter and marie over the
wooden jetty the slipperiness of the cod
was underfoot the reek of the cod in their
nostrils and involuntarily marie shuddered
this was what she had left for a golden day
this was what she had come back to the
thought of taking fork in hand at dawn
once more and standing there on the stage-
head nauseated her and a wild desire to
flee the whole thing filled her impulsive
being

  the lean-to backed the fish-sheds and
through a doorway all sagged askew they
entered peters chateau home of a truth
it was but a summer home occupied during
the fishing-season and deserted while he
spent the winter at bay of islands on the
newfoundland shore but nevertheless its
starkness and squalidity struck taylor like
the blow of a dirty hand

  a tin lantern hung from the low roof
casting a feeble light as if ashamed to
glaringly illuminate the rude habitation
and display its shortcomings to visitors
through holes in the roof the fog was
dripping hitting the hot top of the lantern
with a sputter or streaking down the un-
rinded timbers that held together the
aperture-filled walls underfoot a slab
floor bowed and sprung to the tread a bare
floor knotted uneven yawning with two-
inch cracks littered with its own bark that
the foot skinned off at every step
the foaming fore shore



  as rough as the floor were the fixings that
stood upon it a rusty battered stove a
spruce table adzed out in a solid slab with
trenailed legs and three stools to match
a three-foot cut of a log up-ended served
as a washstand supporting a granite basin
and a pot of soft yellowish soap under an
endless towel revolving on a roller

  at the farther end taylor espied the
sleeping-quarters walled off from the main
room by unplaned boards these were
simply built-in bunks and taylor noted
with a thrill of pleasure the cleanly appear-
ance of maries its opening hung with
new curtains her sea-chest within set out
for a dresser her bed well-ordered

  old peters was primitive enough having
neither curtains nor covering his mattress
a layer of moss but taylor knew that the
hard-fisted old roomer was abroad night
and day never removing his clothes and
sleeping with sea boots and oilskins on
from old annes he turned his eyes away
for he espied a comforter that had not been
washed since her youth and deeper than
that he did not care to pry

  yet old peter might have been a sovereign
in a palace so merrily he laughed at taylors
account of beauports trickery the pre-
dicament of the sly jacques filled the hardy
old mariner with delight

  ciell he chortled that jacques
beauport he is the wily rascal no
fool jacques when it comes to anything
he wants but he is caught this time
but wait-you will see admiral pellier is
a man of honor and fairness oui and a
man of discipline he will draw the truth
from jacques as a man corkscrews a bottle
of brandy voud and that makes me
remember i am dry will you have some-
thing before you go capitaine

  old peter stepped over to his bunk and
from a secret receptacle under the moss pro-
duced a bottle of brandy

  fresh from miquelon inquired taylor
with a laugh

  non st pierre chortled old peter
it is one of a case and there are many
cases-buried you understand where the
customs officer will never grub voire
health capitainei oui and a full voyage
even if your trap is gone and your schooner
dismasted

  your own health peter aye and a full
voyage returned taylor his eyes meeting
maries heres hoping

chapter x

the return of the esperance

vxtiat passed between pellier and beau-

  	 port in the cabin of the esperance the
fishers of chateau never knew for a cer-
tainty but they shrewdly surmised for
in the fair weather of the next day the
auxiliary vessel in charge of codroy john
crossed the strait under a single stick for
repairs at ilumbermouth furthermore
jacques beauport and six men of the groix
went with her and at that chateau tongues
commenced wagging it was plain enough

  voild they all knew marie laval had
another suitor one at last whom she did not
flout jacques beauport the observant
the cunning had tried to get rid of him at a
stroke but jacques had gone too far with
his trickery and the admiral had taken a
hand how honorable that man pellier
the desire of his heart likely to be snatched
away and yet he had not countenanced
the opportunity to take unfair advantage
of his rival

  oui jacques beauport and the six who
had helped him change capitaine taylors
net in secret were going across to be dis-
ciplined at the fishery protection service
headquarters at humbermouth over on
the humber arm of bay of islands new-
foundland

  indeed it seemed that the chateau
tongues were right for taylor heard no
more about the charge of using unlawful
mesh in strait waters his seine was not
returned in all probability because beau-
port had destroyed it but he himself was
not molested as for marie she did not
go back to her stagehead position on old
peters wharf taylor saw to that

  every day in the gray of the dawn
hughie hay took up her work at the room
while she spent her glorious freedom on
the chateau hills or afloat on chateau
bay the graywing being under repairs
in the harbor itself taylor had com-
missioned a trap skiff belonging to laval
and with his handy craft he tended a fresh
trap likewise bought in old peters barter-
house moored in his former trap-berth
his luck ran riotously the cod had
struck in in immense numbers

  every day for three weeks and more was
a big fish day on old peters wharf the
knives flashed early and the kerosene flares
i

adventure

burned late while his vats bulged with
waterhorse and his acres of drying flakes
covered the bawn beach every week
and often twice a week he shipped his
made fish on a foreigner to over-ocean ports
or chartered huge top-masted schooners
from newfoundlands east coast to freight
it to twillingate or fogo

 and well he might for the most
famous cod-grounds on the labrador were
here on its southern fore shore on the banks
and shoals of belle isle strait slimed with
their food the chateau shoals drew the
teeming millions and men of many nations
fished while the harvest held from all
the atlantic ports of the union american
schooners flocked from all the newfound-
land outports all manner of sailing craft
came stationers floaters trawlers gallant
topmast schooners and ponderous brig-
antines

  yet amid a horde of mighty fishers
taylor maintained his reputation as the
greatest of them all no man hauled more
quintals at a single haul than he and no
man sent such catches slithering along old
peters chutes between hauls he and his
crew worked on the graywing like corte-
real of old he cut tall masts from the hills
and when everything was in readiness all
chateau turned out to restep the schooner
and dance on her deck and old peters
wharf in her honor as they christened her
brand-new canvas with strong waters of
the north

  a gay day that and a gay night with one
thousand craft in the bay and ten thousand
men and women on the beach and king
and queen of the ten thousand were capi-
taine taylor and marie laval taylor
hoisting his flag to the foretop and marie
beautiful as a siren spraying the new canvas
with a bottle of port and humming a little
sea song as she sprayed

as marie finished her song she
flung the empty bottle overside
and pointed toward the outer reach
of the harbor

  mon dim-the esperanceshe cried
as if the song called her-and what
mountainous freight has she got

  taylor turned to stare at pelliers
auxiliary vessel boasting a new foremast
and loaded with all the shining lumber
and gear of a modern room codroy john
was in charge and nowhere among her crew

were to be seen jacques beauport and the
six men who had sailed to humbermouth
with him chateau tongues were right
indeed jacques was undergoing his dis-
cipline

  yet taylors wondering mind did not
dwell upon jacques he stared at the
magnificence of the cargo the esperance
carried the finest timbers the most
luxurious fixings he had ever seen destined
for a room on the coast

  is it your fathers stuff marie he
asked and as old peter at that moment
rolled none too steadily down the wharf
to meet the schooner taylor hailed him
with the query how now peter-have
you opened your heart at last yonder
are the makings of a palace aboard the
esperance and it must have cost you a good
many francs

  diable never a franc leered old peter
regarding him and marie with maliciously
triumphant eyes it was paid for by
admiral pellier

  what demanded taylor is pellier
forsaking the bridge for the planters
flakes

  non

  laval shook his souwestered head and
wiggled his chin in mirthful grimace so that
his fringe of white whisker wavered back
and forth

  it is to replace my own old tumble-down
sheds people have laughed and turned
up their offended noses at my room well
wait till the old boards rattle down and
yonder gear goes up instead and we will see
who cackles with laughter and casts the
merry eye mon dieu laughing in
drunken raucousness does it surprise you
then should a son-in-law not be so lavish
with his wealth voild pellier has spoken
to anne and myself in the way of the french
for the hand of our daughter the answer
del see there the marriage gift

chapter xi

the barter-house

tisten for the end of the dance
 lance reminded taylor as half an
hour later he slipped over the rail of the
star of the sea into his dory and watch
for the two boats and dont lose a second
the thing must be done in a flash before
marie is missed its a good job i stowed
the foaming fore shore



my made fish aboard as they came from
old peters flakes the graywing is ready
for the sea except for some light tackle that
im going up to the barter-house to get
better be careful cautioned lance in
farewell its a drunken gang peter has
ashore ill do my part all right dont
worry about that

  taylor pulled in to the wharf and zig-
zagging through the wild dance that was
petering out to an end went on up to
lavals barter-house as he stepped into
the lantern-lighted building that was
crammed with all manner of sea gear he
beheld old peter himself and four of his
cronies chuckling over their half-emptied
glasses

  bon matin capitaine-seeing that
nearly all the night is spent gurgled old
peter come and pledge my daughters
health

  another time peter when the liquor
doesnt run so strong evaded taylor
i just dropped in for that light tackle
you put aside for me the graywing goes
to my trap-berth for this mornings haul
here it is then mumbled laval
give me a hand camaradesl

  the five reached into a canvas-cluttered
corner of the barter-house their hands
flashed forth again not with taylors
tackle but with several yards of seine that
settled on his shoulders caught un-
awares like a lion in a net he hurled him-
self across the floor with the five clinging
desperately to the meshes that enveloped
him

  diable snarled old peter you would
plan to elope with marie-comment you
would steal off in separate dories and let
lance speak the words over your heads
from the rail of the star of the sea and then
dart south in the graywing ciel i am not
so drunk as you think capitaine non but
sober enough to lurk in the shadow of the
graywings sails and overhear you and
marie the end of the dance the moment
too tres bien then there it is the last
scrape of the fiddles

  as he struggled taylor heard the wail of
the violins die away thumping feet leave
the wharf and singing dancers pass along
the beach

  the end taunted old peter almost face
to face with him through the maze of
meshes yet with the protection of that
maze between marie is stealing off in a



dory oui and ill tell you something
the second dory is not lacking it too is
stealing off and admiral pellier is in it

  ho ho do you understand it is
aboard the esperance and not aboard the
graywing she will go pellier has a chaplain
of his own blangard of the groix re-
member a touch of wine and marie will
never know the difference of clergy nor of
bridegrooms over their heads aboard the
esperance i say blangard will speak the
words blangard instead of lance and thus
it will save a lot of trouble with the stub-
bornness of marie

  peter finished with a diabolical chuckle
at his own and pelliers cleverness-pellier
the man of honor and fairness who fell be-
fore a mighty temptation when it came to
the stake of marie

  taylor felt a pang like the thrust of ice
in his heart then a red-hot surge of anger
flooded over him

  you devil peter he roared wrenching
to get his arms free from the binding seine
you cold-blooded shoal-born shoal-
slimed cod first you barter her and
then you try to marry her by a trick
by-

  with the colossal heaving with the
strength of a demon he rocked from wall
to wall of the barter-house crashing its
trappings this way and that dragging the
five backward and forward with the tre-
mendous viking power that was in him
two of them he pinned against the wall
with his bulk and jerked off their feet in a
sudden lurch so that their side of his twine
prison was left for a second unweighted
in that second he writhed his right arm
free and smashed old peter full in the chest
peter staggered the width of the room and
fell backward upon a bundle of sailcloth
and before he could clamber up taylor
struck again and again and peters two
cronies sprawled on top of him

whipping the seine into their
faces with a final swing taylor
darted out of the barter-house door-
way before the other pair could stop him
a riot raged in his heart as he ran down the
wharf straining his eyes out toward the
star of the sea riding at anchorage amid
the harbor craft though the night-shadow
of the chateau hills lay dark upon the
water the approaching dawn was lightening
it a little and he could discern the church
i

adventure

yacht and his own graywing astern of
her

  there were no dories round the star of
the sea-he must be in time a wave of
exultation swept him a joyous cry burst
from his lips-to change the next moment
to a curse round the star of the seas hull
the hull that had hidden them broke two
dories the one spinning adrift with nobody
in it the other rocking to the struggling
of two swaying figures

  pellier marie he recognized them even
in the half-darkness even before maries
pitiful cry came across the harbor to him

  help help she screamed it is pel-
lier he is taking-

  the rest was cut short but taylor had
heard enough with a leap he was afloat
sending his dory surging out

  lance did you see he shrilled as he
boiled by the star of the sea pellier got
her before she made your yacht peter
trapped me in the barter-house but i broke
away

 but where yelled lance peering
after his dory through the dark with his
short-sighted eyes where in the name of
heaven is he taking her

  the esperance taylor snarled back
hell ply her with wine and the groixs
chaplain will marry them

  at taylors information lance threw up
his hands in holy horror a fantom of
supplication in the gloom but taylor him-
self was past the star of the sea and away
driving his dory like a madman to overtake
the struggling pair ahead when like a moth
out of the dusk the esperance her deck-
load discharged and trimmed for speed
winged in between

 taylor heard the metallic clash of
tackles under full sail the schooner
heaved the dory and the two figures in on
the run and drove on out of chateau harbor
like a moth she went and like the black
bat that flits in the wake of the moth the
warship groix slipped after

  convoyed capitaine half-cackled
half-croaked the voice of old peter from
his wharf oui convoyed to a place where
your graywing dare not poke the honey-
moons at humbermouth

  his red wrath gone with the flicker of the
espcrances sails suddenly left white and
trembling taylor turned his eyes shoreward
to see old peter dimly outlined on his stages
by one of his kerosene flares one hand to

his croaking chest that was still heaving in
asthmatic jerks from the effect of the
gloucester captains blow

  white and trembling his red wrath gone
but with the spirit passion that glows like
the white heat of fused metal he shook his
fist at the planter

  youve taken her you and pellier he
answered youve stolen her from me
peter but as sure as the sea winds blow and
the tides turn ill come again to chateau
to take her back

chapter xii

full voyage

and taylor came not that season for

	the autumn gales completely closed
the fore shore to sailing craft nor the next
for marie sent him private word to glouces-
ter of the motherhood that was forced upon
her like the marriage but the following
spring on the heels of winter he came
winging through the strait threading the
maze of icebergs grounded on the shoals
just off chateau and drove into the harbor
itself

  his vow had gone ringing from man to
man along the foaming seaboard the whole
coast was agog for his coming day by
day marie had kept vigil from beacon
hill and day by day the admiral old
peter and the disciplined jacques beauport
had taken council against the lifting of the
graywings sails jacques had been put
on patrol duty with the esperance and
jacques it was who sighted taylors
schooner off york point and brought the
news with a rush to pellier and old peter
on the latters new wharf

  voild the graywing sir he reported
dramatically drawing himself up proudly
on the planed boards

  the devil growled pellier wheeling
from his talk with old peter where
now

  beauport pointed where the schooner
hard in the esperances wake was pushing
through the ice barrier so close the
barrier bulked that it ringed round the
harbor like a wall three days it had lain
thus shutting in the french warship
groix another french gunboat and two
british cruisers on the fisheries patrol
big hulks could not negotiate the narrow
passage where deftly handled schooners
the foaming fore shore



slipped through nor did the sullen berg
show any sign of shifting

  close-hauled with her booms well in-
board to miss the chasm-like walls of the
bergs the graywing burst the barrier the
sunset flaming on her sails and on the fair
head of the viking taylor at the wheel
handling the sheets those on the wharf
saw the well-known forms of his sturdy
crew the adolescent hughie hay the ex-
pectorating irish kerrigan the parson-like
boston jim the lopped-off titan patterson
the braw mccaig the battered sealer hali-
fax the wizened brown

  instantly at sight of the schooner the
chateau beach took up the news fisher
calling to fisher and bark hailing nearby
bark

   mon dieu it is the graywing of glouces-
ter come back

  oui i told one hundred of you that
capitaine taylor would keep his oath
name of a name then admiral pellier
had better to look to himself or he will be
left alone what will the proud man do
pellier heard the medley of comments
and his face flushed

  do he grated to laval and beauport
i will show these fools peter they must
not meet-taylor and marie i must seize
his schooner before he can work any devil-
try

  that will not be hard ventured the
fathomless beauport

  name a charge then jacques flashed
old peter you were always quick of wit
in these things

  why prompted jacques there is the
matter of his voyage here two years ago
it is against the law for an american to
load fish not caught and cured by people
of the united states and he loaded with fish
you cured yourself peter

  ho ho exclaimed old peter grinning
hugely you hear pellier jacques has
a long memory you can trump up no
better excuse than that seize his gray-
wvng at once and hand it over to the british
cruisers to take to st johns the lab-
rador is their shore and theirs is the
administering of its law ciel the ad-
miralty court is sometimes slow com-
prenez-vous the graywing may rot in
the harbor of st johns before its case is
heard and while it is rotting it can not carry
anybody off from chateau

  dieu growled pellier with a whip-like

cracking of his fingers it goes against my
grain but i will do it it is either that

and he finished his sentence with
a reckless shake of his head as he
put off to the groix immediately
the groix got under way and as taylor
boldly rounded to his old anchorage off
lavals new room the warship crossed his
bows and dropped a boat full of men along-
side

  your schooner is seized capitaine
taylor pellier greeted him coolly from his
place in the sternsheets

  for what roared taylor his wrath
abruptly blazing like the sun-set fires

  for a breach of the newfoundland navi-
gation laws announced the admiral
vaguely i shall be compelled to hand
the graywing over to these british cruisers
to be taken to st johns you and your
crew will be set down by the esperance at
the nearest american port get into the
boat and go aboard her

  pellier stepped on the graywings after-
deck old peter laval jacques beauport
codroy john and a dozen more at his heels
forming two guarding lines through which
the admiral beckoned captain and crew

  come quickly he ordered waving a
hand to the groixs guns frowning at point-
blank range there is no chance for
resistance

  you cowards stormed taylor clench-
ing his fists in their faces you scheming
whelps do you think youre going to
drag me off my own deck like a dog by
heavens ill sink to the harbor bottom first
graywing and all

  defiant he crouched his men ready set
behind him itching to hurl themselves at
pelliers men when codroy johns whisper
snarled in his ear codroy stood at the
foot of one of the guarding lines nearest
to taylor and over his massive shoulder
he spat the words through his beard

  in the name o the lard go aboard
captain he urged the esperance be
as swift a schooner as your graywing and
she do lie nearer to the stages will you
take a look

  taylor darted a furtive glance shore-
ward and his blood leaped on old
peters stagehead stood marie with old
anne by her side holding by the hand her
toddling granddaughter fearful lest pellier


adventure

should see the burning in his eyes the
violet flash in maries he turned his head
and searched codroy johns face in-
stantly he read its friendliness and he took
up the terra novans cue

  i dont know boys o mine he spoke
turning to his men with a show of inde-
cision but passing them a warning wink
when it comes down to the fine thing
i dont know i dont care for myself or
the schooner but you fellows have kin
back home i forgot that it isnt fair
to you maybe wed better go aboard the
esperance and fight our case with the law
instead of with our fists

  now that is something sensible capi-
taine cut in pellier growing very uneasy
at the prospect of stubborn resistance it
is under the law i am acting and you have
the very same privilege

  all right then surrendered taylor
just a minute to get the graywings log
and ill be with you ill promise not to
dig up any weapons in the cabin but send
a man with me for formality-codroy
john if you like

  he was off to his cabin as he spoke
codroy john at his heels anticipating the
admirals nod of assent for fear he should
depute some one else

  well codroy demanded taylor fac-
ing the terra novan in the closed cabin
are you with her or with them with
her i take it and the esperance is swift
is she and near the stages but what
about the crew aboard her

  they be newfoundlanders like myself
boomed codroy john aye and like
myself they be with her godfather i
were to her captain taylor and i do love
her like the real father she never have had
or maybe like the-the-the real husband
she never have had the admiral and old
peter and beauport do plan wonderful well
but they do forget we newfoundlanders be
god-fearing men they have gone beyond
the law o god and man and i will never
forgive them for tricking her till i do see
her back in your arms the esperance be
ready captain marie be on the wharf
will you take the chance

  will i exploded taylor grabbing his
log watch me codroy come on be-
fore pellier has a change of mind

  the graywings log under his arm he led
the way into the admirals waiting boat
and the rest of his men filed after pellier

peter beauport and the men of the groix
took their places and the rowers sent the
craft foaming alongside the esperance
taylor noted that the auxiliary vessel was
not at anchor but laying to under foresail
and jib and on her deck he glimpsed her
crew six rugged newfoundlanders whom
codroy john had vouched for

  on to the esperances deck pellier herded
them stepping aft himself to give final
orders to his men before going back to the
groix the grinning peter stepped with
him and beauport both anxious to see
the last of taylor but their last sight was
hardly what they bargained for

  overboard with them all taylor yelled
before pellier could give his orders over-
board with them boys o mine

  with a roar of exultation his crew rushed
the men of the groix codroy john and his
newfoundlanders flocking to their aid
stamping up and down the esperances
deck smiting and wrestling at her rail
irish kerrigan boston jim patterson
brown hughie hay mccaig tom halifax
and bolero the cook smothering pelliers
force in the unexpectedness of their attack
and hurling them into the harbor water

  taylor himself was locked with the admi-
ral old peter and jacques fighting the three
as an ordinary person would fight a single foe
vainly they lunged and struck at him
viking that he was he laughed under their
blows herding them to the esperances
rail and knocking beauport sheer over it
with a lightning blow old peter rushed
but toppled back from taylors straight-arm
punch caught his legs against the rail and
followed beauport while pellier was plucked
from the deck in the gloucester mans
arms and cast overside

  my turn now pellier taylor shouted
as he splashed my turn jacques my
turn peter you foxy old devil

he jumped for the esperances
wheel as he cried his crew of the
graywing and codroys of the
esperance were at the main-sheet hoisting
the big mainsail and as he put over the
spokes he felt the clean-lined schooner an-
swer like his own half a cables length
away old peters long wooden jetty ran out
into the water marie old anne and the
child on its edge as the esperance mo-
mentarily luffed up marie suddenly leaped
the three-foot gap to the schooners rail
the foaming fore shore



  across the slant of the afterdeck she slid
panting with excitement and taylor his
right hand on the wheel caught her to him
with his left holding her thus for a second
even as he held the schooner to the jetty

  marie marie my flower of the coast
he breathed his viking blood pounding to
the thrill to the danger to the touch of her
clinging hands on his free arm and the whip-
ping of her hair against his cheek but
your child-the little madeline

my mother keeps her till things blow
clear and we are free and then she will
bring her to me she has turned to me at
the last my mother just as codroy turned
good exulted taylor

  but the barrier cried marie the ice-
barrier i pray to god we may pass

  she trembled against him her violet eyes
were ablaze with the fire of a woman
awakened to the crisis of her life out
beyond yonder ring of icebergs lay the
open sea a free path down to gloucester a
year of fretting under pelliers enforced
marriage yoke then release and happiness
under the law it was all that stood
between her and another life and through
the gap in the ice wall pellier and his watch-
dog cruisers could not go

  dieu it was a stake dieu how she
prayed and clung as taylor steered for the
barrier under full sail chateau harbor
was in a tumult a thousand clamors rising
in the early dark that dropped suddenly as
the sun failed the beach was a-roar with
fishers shoutings a-rumble with the thud
of their feet as they ran to the stage heads
to keep the esperance in sight

  like a witch the schooner sailed through
the creeping dark and the swirl of mist that
came with the dark her sails gleamed
white pointing for the ice-barrier dead
ahead the groixs boats were picking up
pellier and his men and the second
french gunboat along with the two british
cruisers were moving from their moorings
to come to the groixs assistance but
many crafts were in their way schooners
and brigantines at anchor and before the
war-ships could close the cordon the es-
perance broke through in zigzag tacking
and plunged for the gap amid the bergs

  though the harbor surface was dark the
glittering pinnacles of the bergs still caught
the rays of the sunken sun and glowed
blood-red like the spires of massed cathe-
drals in the dusk on the ruby peaks

perched the resting sea-birds puffins guil-
lemots gulls razor-billed auks all black
as ebony against the crimson afterglow
their sleepy mutterings drowned by the
roar of the waves and the rumble of the
air in the ice caverns beneath them

  like the crash of cannon rose the rumble
of the air as the esperance approached the
passage like the roar of surf on a reef
broke the thunder of the swells across the
emerald ice ledges but above these both
another sound ripped through the air-the
belching guns of the cruisers

  by heavens is the madman firing at us
gasped taylor

  no over us cried marie watching
the red flares of the racing gunboats
over us-to close the passage dont
you see mon dieu dont take time to
close-haul or-

  the rest of her words were lost in the
bursting of shells on the ice pinnacles ahead
in the wailing of startled seabirds and the
crash of tons of berg tips into the gap

  marie was right there was no time to
close-haul the schooner

  hold hard warned taylor every
man hold

  wing and wing he drove her at the cleft
her foresail to starboard mainsail to port
the ends of her booms rasping great furrows
in the ice wall that was crumbling under
the shelling ice fragments were raining
all about and taylor half-stooped at the
wheel over the crouching marie shielding
her with his body against the falling lumps

  a moment the esperance wedged then
the vast drawing power of her canvas
together with the lift of the surge through
the gap carried her on her chafed booms
stood out again and the passage closed be-
hind her by falling pinnacles against all
craft large or small the schooner was gone
in the dark of the open sea driving wing
and wing for gloucester

  so deep was the gloom through which
they bored that the sails and the very
masts themselves were lost in the murk
above even the sluiced decks seemed to
dissolve underfoot taking the blurry forms
of the rest of the crew with them

  taylor and marie isolated at the wheel
seamen to skim a strange sea all their
own even as their hearts skimmed a strange
new life all their own driving southward
viking-prowed down the foaming foreshore
of their love

ssmsjey there ye will-o-the-wisp

i si haerty

s m h it was good to hear that voice
again john haggerty knap-
sacked blanket-rolled and grayish red with
the dust of forty miles turned in time to see
the big irishman that owned it coming
through the door of the eldorado in a rush

sheehy you old reprobate and for a
moment there was nothing but hand-
shaking

didnt expect to see ye till mornin
said sheehy then my stars youre an
annihilator of distance lad

hardly that laughed haggerty but
indeed he was as lean and hard as though
trained for a marathon his youthful face
showed not the slightest sign of fatigue and

he had entered the camp called grizzly
free-jointed and easily

sheehys voice grew more sober as he
looked his friend over

but yeve changed some lad he said
since the crossin of the isthmus

if i have its all ive done said hag-
gerty a little ruefully

except wandering all over like a soul
accursed amended sheehy yell do no
good for yourself that way yed better
stop in grizzly awhile and let whatever
youre lookin for come to ye

its a likely enough looking place for
tilings to happen replied haggerty

say grinned sheehy the only certain
thing about grizzly is its uncertainty tis
as full of explosive unexpectedness as the
belt ye pack but come up to my shanty
where yell sleep the night and after yeve
deposited your baggage ye may have an-
other look

as the two started up the dusty street
together haggerty continued to study the
town curiously

he thought he saw something unique

author of danger trail square etc
forty-nine



about it although in its material aspects it
was like any other mushroom mining-camp
hastily tumbled-up and helter-skelter vig-
orous disreputable and altogether mascu-
line log huts canvas-sided shacks and
shake shanties were strewn haphazardly
along one side of the wide trail plumped
down here and there were larger structures
from which came the blare of hurdy-gurdies
and among the men that thronged in and
out of these places there was the usual sat-
urday evening joviality and pioneer camara-
derie but there seemed something else too
watchfulness clannishness suspicion he
would have defined it but he said nothing
and followed sheehy to his shack

  when they came out an hour later it was
quite dark the street had grown quieter
but loud talk and cascades of roaring laugh-
ter broke from the eldorado and wild-
looking silhouettes showed through its can-
vas walls

  haggerty and sheehy drifted from this to
several kindred places and wound up in the
golden bear all the time haggerty
played his usual part of total abstainer he
studied the crowd closely pursuing the
search that had become a fixed mental
habit with him and while he looked he re-
newed his impression of the unusual

  after a while he was able to analyze it
there was an unfamiliar element in the
crowd mingling with the boisterous mi-
ners the pale-faced passionless-eyed gam-
blers and the inevitable rag-tag collection of
loafers and hangers-on were numerous
others that seemed to have no place in a
mining-town for one thing their hands
were uncalloused and their heels spurred
but more significant still was their peculiar
air of blended secrecy and challenge and the
aloofness and even hostility with which the
regular miners treated them

  obviously unearned though it was these
men seemed to have plenty of gold in the
golden bear they were so numerous that
haggerty put his growing suspicion into a
question

  what is this place he asked sheehy
a mining-camp or something else i
didnt think he added significantly there
was as much gold coin this side of the
divide

  the bar at which they stood was lined
with noisy men and behind them well-
patronized gambling-tables wheels and
layouts filled the place to the door sheehy

looked swiftly over the crowded room and
then drew haggerty to an unoccupied cor-
ner near the end of the bar

   ive been waitin for ye to ask me that
he said in a cautious tone ye heard of
some outlawry on the way up maybe

   a lot of it replied haggerty

   and indeed a flood of crime had recently
spread all over the up-country mysteri-
ous disappearances were common the bod-
ies of men were found floating in streams
their gold removed express riders were held
up and shot and a general era of deviltry
seemed to have set in

  well said sheehy tis the general
opinion that most of the troubles born
right here this riff-raff ye see-about a
month ago they began to drift in on us
about that time too black doak comes
and buys this place and tis here they make
their headquarters ye can see the cut-
throat faces of em and theyve no visible
means of support save the revolvers in their
belts and there ye are but theres more
and more of em all the time and any night
ye can hear em boastin in their cups of
what they would do to grizzly if we run em
out they wouldnt go far they say havin
a hidin-place near that no man could find
nor a regiment take

  this black doak whos he asked
haggerty

  well if ye ask me hes the leader of
em said sheehy if ye ask him hes
proprietor of this place and a respectable
business man if ye ask the average miner
yell get but an earful of luridity for hes the
man that gets their gold to sacramento for
em and charges a third for the service
there was a pony express before his
chargin but ten per cent but ye may guess
what happened to the riders speakin in
general hes grizzlys man on horseback
and a cornin millionaire or a cornin orna-
ment to the end of a rope and if ye will
look cornin through the door-thats him
haggerty looked what his eyes saw was
a very large man with a dark hard face
glittering black eyes and the general look of
the human wolf what his mind regis-
tered was the end of a year-old chase and
the promise of a rehabilitated life

  he stepped sharply forward his eyes
flaming and then as suddenly he stopped
turned to sheehy and asked in an anxious

eager whisper-

  thats doak you say


adventure

  yes whats up lad

  haggertys face expressed a torrent of
swift thoughts doak the master of griz-
zly his quarry caught at last and still be-
yond reach a desperate riddle flashed
through haggertys mind-a riddle that
must quickly be solved he put part of it
in words to the astonished sheehy

 dont look at him now if any one
wanted-wanted anything out of him
thered be no way to get it in grizzly would
there

  short of killin him said sheehy there
wouldnt

  tell me quick is there anything that
would make it hard for him to leave this
place

  hes gettin rich here said sheehy
and then theres a girl a good girl too
he seems to have lost his head there but
the girl-

  all right thats all

   haggerty straightened around
     just as doak saw him

laaj in his turn doak blinked with
surprise he faltered in his pace and for
an instant every feature of him expressed a
sharp and unmitigated terror then he too
seemed to have a second thought and
it was with somewhat of a gloating smile
that he altered his course and marched
straight toward haggerty

  but haggerty curiously enough looked
at him casually and then away again as
though he had never seen him before and
when doak stopped in front of haggerty he
was met with a look of blank inquiry

  well so its you said doak it was
half a sneer and half a threat

  whats that asked haggerty in ap-
parent surprise

 oh dont bluff i know you-hag-
gerty

  thats my name said haggerty won-
deringly

  they usually change it said doak
nastily but that bein the case maybe its
smarter not to

  its a common name replied haggerty
with rising anger i tell you again youve
made a mistake

  oh you cant put that over rasped
doak and ill tell you what i aint no
blasted peacher and its too cursed much
trouble to turn you up but this camp aint
big enough for you and me i wont ad-

mire seein you around here after tonight
i hope you go blind then said hag-
gerty evenly

  look out for yourself then you-

  in the middle of his sentence doaks
hand had flashed to his revolver butt but
the weapon was never withdrawn sheehy
didnt see whence he had snatched it nor
it is likely did doak but in haggertys
hand had suddenly appeared a short ugly
derringer its muzzle filed smooth where
the front sight had been was shoved against
doaks chest

  thatll be all tonight said haggerty
crisply now about face

  doak hesitated an instant glaring at
haggerty furiously

  im squeezing the trigger warned hag-
gerty tensely

  involuntarily it seemed doak glanced
down at the menacing hand and saw the
whitening knuckles in a sort of hurry
he wheeled toward the bar

  so swiftly and quietly had the incident
passed that not more than three men ob-
served it and they made no remark doak
passed behind the bar haggerty turned
to sheehy and found the latter regarding
him in utter bewilderment

  saints in heaven cried sheehy where
did ye get that gun

  sleeve draw explained haggerty pock-
eting the weapon its good for snakes
lets get out of this

  outside they turned toward sheehys
cabin sheehy according to his non-
inquisitive code waited for haggerty to
speak

  you saw what happened began hag-
gerty after a moment ive got to get
that man ive got to get him alive not
dead and from what you say ill have to
smash his gang to do it so im going to be

a mighty unsafe friend-

  another remark of that kind inter-
rupted sheehy and yell be no friend at all
what dye think i am as i explained be-
fore im needin a partner mighty bad
will ye come

  haggerty hesitated

  the claim next mine said sheehy care-
lessly is worked by the girl i told ye about
the one doaks courtin

  by a girl exclaimed haggerty

  sure and her father

  a quick hard light leaped into haggertys
eyes
forty-nine



  i will sheehy said he and thank
you kindly for the chance

n

so monday morning haggerty
joined the workers in the gold-bear-
ing gulch that lay back of grizzly
and he was peering into the riffles of shee-
hys cradle for signs of their first joint clean-
up when he heard a womans voice behind
him he turned and saw a girl helping a
feeble old man down an ill-defined trail to
the gold diggings

  they had evidently come from a teetery-
looklng tent pitched beside an ancient
prairie schooner half-way up the side of the
gulch they reached the claim adjoining
sheehys and immediately fell to work
the girl picked up a shovel and swung
lightly down into the miniature shaft
intermittent showers of black earth began
to come out of it the old man loaded it
into a crudely constructed wheelbarrow

  when the barrow was full the girl climbed
out of the hole and wheeled it down to the
tumbling creek the old man began plying
the bucket while she alternately shoveled
the earth into the cradle and rocked it
always haggerty saw she did the lions
share of the work

  thats rosa brookes asked haggerty
in a queer voice

  sure said sheehy theres none
other like her in grizzly

  haggerty stared at her somehow he
had fitted his imagination of the girl to her
surroundings he had pictured an amazon
of a woman strong rough semi-masculine
this girl was strong but there the parallel
ended she was daintily feminine from the
top of her broad felt hat to the worn soles
of her shoes her face was dark and irreg-
ularly beautiful she was like a flower
transplanted from a hot-house somewhere
and shrinking a little

  it wasnt like haggerty that imagery yet
it was apt for though the girl worked
busily smiled at her father hummed little
tunes to herself he could see that down deep
she was filled with uneasiness an un-
easiness that haggerty could well under-
stand when he recalled what sheehy had
told him quite apart from doaks pur-
suit of her her late history had been enough
to weaken the courage of the bravest

  she and her father had been members of
one of the most ill-fated of the transconti-

nental parties it had lost itself in the
humboldt sink it had taken a wrong cut-
off it had finally been compelled to winter
in the high sierras more than half its
number had died there including rosas
two brothers an honorable testimony it is
to those nineteenth-century argonauts that
most of the women in all those famine-
beleagured expeditions survived

  those who got through at last had made
straight for the lowlands as though driven
by an obsession but old man brookes
had broken down in grizzly and rosa had
stayed with him perforce now they
wanted only to get back to the east with
enough money to buy back the home they
had sold to make t he trip

  id sure hate to see em start sheehy
had said as long as doak holds the
road

  haggerty studied the girl clear as the
sunlight was the impression he got of fine-
ness and strength and unsullied honesty and
all of a sudden he wanted very much to win
her friendship for reasons quite apart from
his desire to trouble doak he wanted
more than the nodding acquaintance sheehy
and the other miners had and all morning
he puzzled over the problem of attaining it

  that afternoon chance favored him
sheehy and he were deep-tunneling at the
time up-stream in the direction of the
brookes claim haggerty uncovered a
nugget a pitted and scored chunk of almost
pure gold dull-colored and heavy they
exulted over their find until haggerty sug-
gested they might have tunneled too far
exact measurements proved he was right
by his statement of where he had found it
the nugget belonged to the brookeses

  so he explained the matter and gave it to
them it was a small thing in a way but it
was the beginning of trust and that is never
a small thing haggerty felt somewhat
sheepish under the appreciative light of
rosa brookes eyes and under the old mans
thanks and even when he accepted what he
had played for an invitation to call some-
time at their tent but he wouldnt have
undone what he had done

  that night haggerty turned over to
sheehy a hundred dollars in dust it was
half the approximate value of the nugget

  im afraid i lied a bit said haggerty
it really came out of our dirt i tunneled
a little further after i found it thats all

  sheehy didnt look as astonished as he


adventure

might he chuckled a little and then fell
into a thoughtful silence

  i wonder if youre playin quite fair
lad he hazarded at length

  haggerty stared at him

  what do you mean

  well said sheehy slowly ill tell ye
doak knows the girl thinks nothin of him
for hes forced himself on her through fear
but after the manner of his kind hes in love
with her yeve seen a flame lick up the
side of a house devourin while it caresses-
well thats the way of his love also he
hates ye also the two of ye have an ac-
count to be settled betwixt ye consider
them things and the undisciplined bundle
of evil passions that ye know doak to be
and then ask yourself if youre the safest
friend in the world for the girl to have

  but haggerty had already considered
them and to a different conclusion than
sheehys he was very young and he had
the confidence of youth and youths ability
to believe what he wanted to - if rosa
brookes were in danger then so much more
did she need him as a friend

  also as sheehy may have suspected he
had another motive

  he underestimated doak both his
strength and his weakness else he would
not have reasoned as he did if doak were
made jealous well and good the more
tightly would he be held in grizzly and the
more time would haggerty have to work
out the destruction of doaks power in
grizzly the seizure of doak and his own
vindication

  haggertys mind went a long trail back-
ward that night and at the end of that trail
there lay a dead man and a cell with a
broken lock

ill

ive done what you asked me
to said rosa brookes i dont
see him any more but im-im
afraid i try not to be it seems silly but
hes-drinking lately and im afraid of
him

  you musnt be worried haggerty
itll be all right in a week more-

  it was sunday and they were sitting on
a little knoll covered with swaying wild
oats quite out of sight or hearing of the
camp

  theres so much i dont understand
puzzled the girl about you and-him

they say the first night you came here you
had trouble with him and youve been
working against him ever since trying to
organize the miners against him of course
thats good if hes what you say but-
and she hesitated but hes been saying
terrible things about you too to me and
everybody

  what did he say asked haggerty his
voice hardening

  he said replied rosa in a low tone and
with an effort that if i knew everything
about you id never look at you again
that you are worse than even he is
and he said in a few days more hed
be able to prove it and he would

  for a minute haggerty stared out over
the flower-strewn hills an uneasy look on
his face then he turned to rosa and asked
softly-

  supposing he did-supposing he seemed
able to prove it would you believe him

  oh i dont know doubted rosa
she sat twisting her hands perplexedly
everything out here is so different the
men are different even you you did
shoot a man yesterday i heard about
it

  the thing had been torturing her all day

  he tried to shoot me said haggerty
briefly i could have killed him i
didnt

  oh im glad of that said rosa tensely

  it was the way i knew youd feel about
it that saved him said haggerty he
was worse than a rattler

  indeed the man had drawn on him
without word or warning haggertys
lightning quickness only had saved him
the would-be assassin who was one of the
golden bears most sinister habitues had
evidently relied on doaks power to shield
him from the result of his crime it was
the second attempt on haggertys life in
two weeks the other time he had been
shot at from behind in the dark and the
bullet had gone through his hat

  haggerty turned the talk to other topics
delighting to see rosas eyes and face light
up after a while as she forgot herself and
doak and grizzly and fell under the in-
fluence of the perfect day and the windr
swept hills they found much to talk
about those two but most of the way back
they walked in that close silence that some-
times falls between those that draw nearer
than friendship
forty-nine



  after they had parted however hag-
gertys mind reverted to doaks threat

  he had thought that if doak were to de-
nounce him he would have done it when
haggerty first appeared in grizzly the
fact that he hadnt seemed to prove his
fear and the correctness of haggertys sur-
mise his threat at this late day meant
something haggerty wondered what
whimsy of fate might have put in doaks
hands the seeming proof he had mentioned
and he wondered whether doak in sheer
desperation born of jealousy and hatred and
fear would find the courage to use it

  but in the morning haggerty put aside
his doubts and got busy again

  his work was double those days he was
both miner and missionary in the eyes of
those of grizzlys citizens who profited by
the presence of doaks men he was a des-
picable malcontent to most of the
miners he had been from the first a man of
mysterious motives who was dooming
himself to death in a worthy but hopeless
cause the second man he preached his
gospel of law-and-order to warned him
there was one man started to buck
doak already we buried him quiet
the verdict was extreme shortness of
breath brought on by lead-poisonin

  but haggerty managed to live he lived
and talked and made friends and for a while
that was about all

  he heard peculiar arguments where
there was no law there could be no crime
anyway every man his own policeman
that was good enough grizzly was only
a temporary camping-place why should
they trouble themselves they hadnt
time to bother their corns hadnt been
trampled on much let the rest of the coun-
try take care of itself

  but gradually he began to get the decent
element of the camp together he began
to rouse in them resentment at the domi-
nance of the outlaws he urged that
sooner or later the clash would come as it
had come in other camps and in the larger
cities and backing him in all this was the
instinct for order and self-government that
shows itself wherever anglo-saxons gather

  numerically the honest men in grizzly
were greatly in the superiority but they
were very busy they were making money
and before haggertys advent they had a
strong tendency toward letting well enough
alone also they had a normal regard for

their own lives and they foresaw that an
open clash with doaks men meant blood-
shed and nothing short of actual destruc-
tion of the gang would serve

  if they but drove the desperadoes out to
that secret rendezvous of which they
boasted so often then life in grizzly would
be a desperate adventure indeed

  but as it was there was ceaseless irrita-
tion the very presence of the undesir-
ables was like a challenge their mysteri-
ous disappearances and returns followed
always by the story of some back-country
outrage kept the camp filled with a certain
sense of indignity and they were bold blus-
terers for the most part with a touch of the
bully about them whose loud words goaded
to anger far more men than they cowed

  all this helped haggerty he was care-
ful in choosing his leaders he got as the
nucleus of his vigilante organization the
soldier men in camp the two storekeepers
a doctor a square gambler half a dozen
middle-aged miners they were already
impatient with conditions and were not
hard to enlist the rest followed slowly
but as the days went by cohesion set in
haggerty was confident that given time he
would have the respectable element of the
camp with him to a man

  and now he began to reveal the reward he
would ask for doak taken alive and de-
livered into his hands

  the trouble was all this could not be
hidden from the crooks their surface re-
action to the threat was defiance and an
increasing arrogance but underneath they
were growing uneasy they knew the
strength that could be massed against them
once it had coalesced haggerty heard
that the clearer-headed among them were
urging doak to retire from the town his
great fear was that they would have their
way before he got ready to strike

  and what of doak all this time

iv

it was very beautiful that night
through trees motionless as senti-
nels the starlight trickled close and
friendly the giant ridges were things of
loveliness so softly silhouetted were they
against the dusky sky in the bottom of
the gulch the tumbling brook made music
ancient as the world and rosa and hag-
gerty sitting alone by the dying embers of a


adventure

camp-fire made believe to forget that there
was anything else in the world than the
visible harmony that surrounded them em-
braced them and drew their souls together
in a spell as simple and clean and sweet as
itself

  rosas father had gone to bed and the
two had been alone perhaps an hour when
from somewhere above them from beyond
the wall of rocks that half encircled the tent
and made haggertys position compara-
tively safe came the sound of breaking
shrubbery

  instantly rosa was on her feet with the
fear of doak on her and was urging hag-
gerty out of the circle of light and behind
the tent

  haggerty obeyed though the visitor
seemed to be making too much noise to be
dangerous and so they stood there until
doak rounded the tent and came up to the
camp-fire

  the hell of evil passions in which he had
presumably writhed the last few weeks had
changed him greatly he was unshaven
and shaken and nervous and he glared sus-
piciously around in the shadows when
haggerty followed by rosa stepped for-
ward his body tensed galvanically and he
emitted an inarticulate growl

  well from haggerty

  thought id find you here with an
attempt at a sneer

  what do you want inquired haggerty
shortly	t

  i want to talk with you and with
rosa too ive got something here itll
do you both good to hear about

  a note of malevolent triumph was in his
voice but it was strange how the fear that
had never been absent from him since hag-
gertys arrival in grizzly broke through that
triumph even then and tempered it with
doubt

  well come to the point snapped
haggerty

  ill come to it quick enough declared
doak

  his hand went inside his coat it came
out with nothing more ominous than a
newspaper crumpled dog-eared and brown
with age but haggerty drew a sharp breath

  i sent a man to san francisco for this
said doak what dyou suppose is in it

  haggerty before whom the past had risen
like a specter gripped himself collected his
wits and replied coolly

  why i suppose judging from its ap-
parent age and your manner that its an
account of the murder of my uncle it
probably has my description in it too as the
supposed murderer and mentions the fact
that i broke jail and that theres a thousand
dollars reward for my arrest

  rosas cry at this abrupt confession was
the piteous one of a woman who feels her
world tottering to its foundation but
doak replied with a jeering chuckle

  wonder if youll admit it all as easy
when the boys get hold of you dyou
know what im goin to do with this

  why youre going to tear it up said
haggerty easily

  oh am i grated doak just am i
i tell you what im givin you just one
more chance for life if youre out of this
camp by sunrise all right if you aint ill
publish this to the camp and thatll fix
you with your-respectable support all
right then ill get the boys together and
string you up for the cowardly murderer
you are

  haggerty his eyes never leaving doak
stepped forward and kicked some dry
twigs into the middle of the fire

  a nice program he said thoughtfully
this worlds a strange place seems like
we never can get away doesnt it did you
everhear of the law of compensation
doak

  doak said something under his breath

  yes went on haggerty slowly it
was a cowardly cold-blooded crime for
money there couldnt have been any other
motive and they found part of his money on
me he and i had quarreled too and they
proved that i was a boy then-seems
more than a year ago doesnt it-and
pretty impulsive but hed taken care of
me all my life working late at night
shoeing a neighbors horse-a country
cross-roads blacksmith my uncle was and a
farmer too-and you can see how the mur-
derer came up from behind and struck him
down but there was a struggle

  do you know doak ive a curious
theory about crime i believe the crimi-
nals always branded some way you
cant get away from it it leaves its mark
now this particular crime-but we wont
talk any more about it do as you like
only it would be strange if i were hung in
grizzly i was sure id found a sign of good
luck here
forty-nine



  a peculiar effect these latter rambling
words had on doak his figure wavered in
the dancing firelight and the paper in his
hand stirred and rustled as though it too
were possessed of quivering nerves

  what dyou mean by that he snarled
viciously

  why what do you think i mean
asked haggerty lightly we all have our
superstitions havent we now in a
voice turned deadly youve told your
story we want no more of you go and
tell it to the camp if you dare

  by- i will cried doak

  if i were afraid of you said haggerty
evenly wouldnt i shoot you where you
stand now go

  doaks shoulders came forward in a
crouch but he turned away the menac-
ing crouch and the cautious retreat were one
and the same movement haggerty drew
rosa swiftly into the shadow of the tent
with his hand on his gun he watched doak
until he disappeared then he turned to
rosa

  its all true he said swiftly what was
in the paper im wanted-hunted-now
-this minute the other day on the hill i
asked you a question im asking it
again

  oh what-what was it-jack

  do you believe-

  no no you couldnt i didnt think
-no she clung to his arm

  then god is good cried haggerty
filled with a double joy for doaks the
man i was sure of it and now-

  he was blinded by a crashing blow he
didnt hear the report of the gun he felt
himself slipping down felt rosas arms
around him he struggled for sight for
strength he knew he called out doaks
name he did hear the clatter of a horses
hoofs and the second explosion of the revol-
ver he felt rosa dragged away from him
and then he fell into a great depth wherein
was nothing but shadows

  he struggled up out of that depth it
took a long time and a great effort and a
sense of necessity that was more terrible
than hell-fire urged him he found himself
swaying unsteadily on his feet there were
men holding him there were more
around a great crowd of them he heard
one say

  skulls creased thats all lucky
devil

  rosa rosa cried haggerty in a ter-
rible voice

  a silence came over that crowd that was
like the silence of the utterly damned

  then some one spoke from the open flap
of the tent-old man brooke has cashed
in all right

  god groaned some one after an inter-
val cant we do anything

  how can we came the answer with
our horses druv away

  and with doak and his whole devils
brood gone if there was one left one
wed find a way to the rest

  it was doak done this most likely he
had the rest waitin by the corral i heard
em riding off like mad right away after i
heard the shots it was so we couldnt
follow they took the horses

  listen

  a gust of wind had driven down the canon
from the east and upon it rode like a chal-
lenge the retreating sound of a galloping
horse

  let me go cried haggerty suddenly
lad youre hurled came sheehys
voice

  but strength was flowing back upon hag-
gerty like a tide and flinging off the friendly
hands that would have held him he started
on a run up the side of the gulch in the wake
of the double-burdened horse

  there were others close behind him when
he hit the trail but they did not last

v

up exhaustion the triple tor-
iy ment of bursting heart of straining
lungs of flagging muscles a brain
weary too from its constant insistence
upon the single idea of just one effort more
and another and another the passage
from this into a state of sheer physical
deadness in which the body becomes an
incumbrance worse than useless flesh that
must be lifted and lifted and driven forward
by an overweening will and then that
very will dies into a torturing sense of in-
evitability past and future are alike wiped
out and there is nothing else in the world
but a grim eternity of endless effort con-
sciousness absorbed in pain a madness an
obsession an agony

  such were the stages through which hag-
gerty passed in his pursuit of doak but
when that last stage came it was not


adventure

punishment but a very great relief for
there are mental agonies that pass the physi-
cal and in the moment of his discovery of
rosas abduction haggerty had thought to
go mad black dogs of nameless horror
threatened the citadel of his mind and re-
morse flayed his soul like a scorpion-
tipped whip

  remorse for was he not himself to blame
had he not in sickening truth played rosa as
a pawn played her attractions to hold doak
in grizzly now nothing mattered but
rosas safety but like a whisper from a
barbed tongue was the thought too late
too late until that horrible numbness
came like a blessing

  he had started from the camp of catas-
trophe shortly after midnight at first his
reason held him down to the easy falling
stride of the distance runner very shortly
this stride became a necessity

  there were three tilings that gave him
hope the horse was double-loaded for doak
had evidently no desire to explain to his
followers his use for a second mount the
trail was worn wide and plain by the immi-
grant wagons and he was trained down to
the finest point by lucky chance he was
wearing riding-breeches and light shoes
he threw off coat and upper shirt and
threw away half of his cartridges he would
have thrown away the gold dust in his hip
pocket but he forgot it

  very little light came through the trees
that overhung his path haggerty stum-
bled often and sometimes fell headlong
but he was always up again and going and
he never quite lost the sound of the hoof-
beats ahead

  once doak pulled his horse down to a
walk then haggertys dimming con-
sciousness was shot through with the deli-
rium of hope surely he could overtake
him now a berserker rage came to hag-
gerty and he felt his hands on his enemys
throat then doak his horse rested was
off again on a gallop this happened again
and again and each time was a torment

  haggerty never halted never consciously
slackened his pace he knew if he did he
would never get started again but deeper
rooted still was the knowledge that as he
was running he would continue to run until
he caught doak or lost him hopelessly or
died of a broken heart

  he ran on for hours for days for endless
years it seemed after a while the only

sense impression he had was that of the
sound he followed the stars began to
pale the eastern sky grew purple the
early summer dawn came rushing over the
hills to meet him and he did not know it

  it was broad daylight and he had not
realized it he wondered what made him
realize it now then he knew for the
crooked trail had turned straight and plain
in view perhaps half a mile ahead was a
horse with two riders

  haggerty tried to run faster but his
legs would not respond a desperate
anger came over him it was an anger
directed against his body a faulty mechan-
ism that failed him in stress

  but he kept on in the same jogging trot
his breathing racked him from the dia-
phragm upward the sound of it was like a
sobbing blood had matted on his face
and where it was not the skin showed pur-
ple with the unoxygenized life fluid above
his hips his muscles were loose lax so his
trunk was held insecurely to its pivot and
swayed as he ran

  a little later his quarry disappeared
down a declivity when haggerty got to
the edge of the canon into which the trail
descended doak was nowhere in sight
and yet haggerty could see a long way
ahead

  puzzled he descended to the canons bot-
tom and then he understood to the
right the canon was blocked with a land-
slide but to the left it was open with a
flooring of broken rocks and he stood
considering what to do

  his changed posture made haggerty
aware of the bulge on his hip he took out
the sack of dust and dumped half its con-
tents on a rock in the middle of the trail
then with his teeth he worried a hole in the
sack so the rest would sift out slowly
holding it in his hand he turned into the
canon for quite a distance the way he
took was marked with yellow dust

  his pace was a shamble the way was
hazardous with holes and abrupt descents
haggerty fell often he did not always
rise again immediately but when he fell it
was forward and when he was down he
made way on hands and knees

  he followed no tracks but on that hard
bottom there could have been no tracks to
follow

  after a while as through a thick red
mist he saw doak again doak was an
forty-nine



unthinkable distance ahead he was pick-
ing his way on foot leading the horse in the
saddle of which still sat the woman

  and again doak disappeared he disap-
peared mysteriously with a snarl at his
failing senses haggerty brushed the sweat
from his eyes and stared again where
doak had been there was a patch of under-
brush haggerty reached that underbrush
and stopped

  he dropped flat to the ground and wrig-
gled into the bushes looking all ways he
came to where he thought the wall of the
canon should have been and there was no
wall there

  there was vacancy there a hole it
seemed opening straight into the face of the
cliff a tunnel higher than a man and
broader from which came a grumbling
voice

  what the devils that good lord a
woman

  lend a hand here take the nag
replied doak surlily

  there aint no one watchin here but
me objected the voice

  never mind i got away clean theres
no danger

  hoof-beats and footsteps receded into the
earth haggerty gathered his strength and
followed his legs had become incum-
brances he dragged himself with his
hands and writhed along

  a square of light appeared ahead of him
outlined against it were four figures one
man had hold of a womans arm the other
led the horse suddenly all four passed be-
yond that square of light and melted into a
confusion of moving forms

  haggerty struggled on to the end of the
passage with his body twisted behind a
projecting rock he stole a look into the
rock-bound chamber

  just within the entrance stood doak with
his hand on rosas arm fronting them at
various distances were perhaps twenty-five
men most of whom haggerty had seen in
grizzly against the opposite wall of the
rendezvous were tethered the horses there
were many cases of goods and ammunition
boxes there too the whole place was
dimly lighted with two oil-lamps brack-
eted near the entrance

  lord doak this aint no place for a
woman haggerty heard one man say

  thats all right replied doak sharply
simpson you go guard the tunnel

  and doak began to lead rosa across the
front of the crowd to the right

  haggerty saw he was making for a narrow
opening in the wall beyond which looked to
be another and smaller chamber rosa
saw it too for she cried out and began to
struggle protesting growls mingled with
the brutal laughs of the men but none
stirred to help her and then haggerty had
never felt stronger in his life and he pulled
his gun and fired

  as he fired he leaped he was on doak
before doak struck the floor blood
smeared haggertys hand as he gripped
doak by the right shoulder and dragged him
toward the breach in the wall leading into
the inner chamber doaks revolver in-
stantly drawn clattered against the floor
rosa snatched it up haggerty shoved her
violently ahead of him a bullet whistled
past haggertys head as he followed rosa
through the opening the next instant he
had jerked doak inside the second chamber
and whirled around his revolver swaying
level like a serpents head searching for a
target

vi

he had acted without plan
wholly on impulse and it was with
astonishment that he realized there
was no target there and that for the mo-
ment at least he held the outlaws at an im-
passe his range of vision commanded the
outer end and exit of the chamber when he
had made his rush the outlaws had been
back of this space and they stayed there
fulminating threats and curses the net
situation was that if they held him prisoner
prisoners he also held them

  also he held another advantage his
first words cutting sharply into their
jumble of voices reminded them of this
rosa the first shot thats fired in here
kill doak you out there you know me
keep back

  their talk died away at this and then
one voice replied bullyingly-

  - young fellow you cant bluff us

all

  i can kill half a dozen of you though
replied haggerty with apparent conviction
he thanked god they did not know how he
was trembling from head to foot with ex-
haustion

  well get you in the end though
  haggerty did not reply the fact was


adventure

incontestable one man could not stand
forever against twenty-five nor could the
outlaws afford to let either him or rosa
escape with the secret of their personnel and
hiding-place the situation was as hope-
less as could be imagined

  say young fellow lets call it quitsy
came the offer you let doak go and
well let you go well let you leave here
safe thats a promise

  and the girl asked haggerty

  sure replied the man readily

  how do we know youll let us go
  aint our word good

  haggerty laughed shortly

  youll have to do better than that

  all right then replied the bargainer
angrily we can do that too

  what about doak haggerty replied to
the threat

  well said the man deliberately doak

was-fool enough to get us into this

  and then haggerty knew that his best
card had failed him he could imagine
that doaks power over his men had re-
cently been slipping fear is very ruinous
to leadership and doak of late had been
very much afraid

  he was afraid now amid a stream of
curses at his men at haggerty at every-
thing he demanded if haggerty meant to
let him bleed to death

  haggerty passed back a knife and hand-
kerchief and rosa set to work to bandage
his wound as best she might

  haggerty never stirred from his post
the rest was doing him good he was stead-
ier now he wondered how the outlaws
would go about it to accomplish their
threat

  he wasnt left long in doubt a brisk
hammering began without the splintering
of wood and the creaking of nails wrenched
from their sockets haggerty remembered
the packing-cases and ammunition boxes
and he knew they were being shaped into
a movable barricade he wondered whether
at the last moment he had not better turn
rosa over to the desperadoes trusting what
remnants of white manhood there might be
in them he decided not

  he was roused from a spell of black and
remorseful brooding by rosas excited voice

  why she cried theres a scar here
on his shoulder

  there is said haggerty almost indif-
ferently

  a scar a burn the shape of-of a horse-
shoe

  her voice was full of significance and a
question

  yes said haggerty youve guessed
it the same mark was on my uncles
body in half a dozen places the bum of a
horseshoe white hot from the forge it fell
to the floor and they struggled over it and i
figured his murderer couldnt escape and
i was sure it was doak doak had been
working for him hed quit and gone two
days before but that was a trick i knew
he wanted to get to the gold fields and
hadnt the money

  why that explains-

  everything said haggerty dully
my talk of brands and why doak was
afraid to accuse me and-why youre here
i drove him mad rosa with fear and jeal-
ousy and hate and i never thought of you

i deserve to die-but you-

  hush said rosa you saved me
from-you are dying for me theres no
chance is there jack

  he was silent he could not bring him-
self to tell her there was none yet how
could he bid her hope

  -you said doak weakly youll

both die with me like rats

  and then minute by minute a long time
dragged away it might have been an
hour the sound of the preparations for
attack went on unceasingly to haggerty
the suspense became almost unendurable
if he had been alone he would have leaped
out and ended it all in one quick flurry of
fight

  once from rosa a curious question con-
sidering what was impending

  jack why did you-run away

  i was a young fool said haggerty i
was afraid i thought theyd convict me
i had part of his money you know and
wed quarreled-that was the reason i had
his money hed given it to me and i was
going away

  you wouldnt do it now said rosa
no said haggerty i wouldnt do it
now

  man-like he wondered at her womans
sigh of relief it was the one blot she knew
of on his shield

  close upon that came their warning of
imminent doom the scraping upon the
rocks of the wooden barricade its further
end came into view how thick it was
forty-nine



haggerty could not tell nor how it was held
upright but it was loop-holed at conveni-
ent intervals and it was high enough so that
haggerty could catch no glimpse of the
crouching bodies that pushed it forward

  haggerty felt a light touch on his shoul-
der

  jack you may-kiss me-now

  a moment later the muzzle of a gun ap-
peared in one of the loop-holes haggerty
fired and by luck and good marksmanship
managed to drive his bullet through the
opening

  the curses of the wounded outlaw were
checked by the harsh voice of his leader

  serves you right mind what i said
the rest of you not a shot until we can
give him a volley

  thereafter the barricade came on stead-
ily and with motive power as invisible as
though the planks themselves had been
granted life it swung out as a gate is
turned the end nearer haggertys refuge al-
most immovable the further end sweeping
clear across the cave it was a terrible
thing to see it coming and not to be able to
check it and to anticipate the storm of
bullets that would burst from it the moment
it got into position it was a more terrible
thing to imagine rosas body riddled hor-
ribly and lying limp and bloody   

  we dont want to kill the girl came the
offer if shell come out we wont
haggerty hesitated but rosa cried out
no no and there was an end of that 
doak was alternately cursing and praying
in maudlin fashion haggerty was bathed in
cold sweat and he found himself longing for
the end of everything

  inch by inch foot by foot the barricade
advanced now it cut across haggertys
field of view and crept past the mouth of
the tunnel and now in the dark mouth of
the tunnel haggerty saw a shadowy moving
shape

  he saw several and one stepped tenta-
tively within the cave back of the outlaws
and with a wave of the arm summoned the
others and instantly haggerty called out
with a careful simulation of broken nerve
say there you theres no use of this
well come out

  no use of that now weve got you
ill get some of you though you know
that

  weve figured it different were willin
to take the chance



  but the girl and doak you dont
want to kill them too i tell you well
all come out

  well what dye say boys saves am-
munition all right they say come out
then

  rosa are you ready

  just a minute she took her cue from
the thin line of hard-visaged men that were
filing with indian stealth through the en-
trance of the rendezvous

  make yourself beautiful miss jeered
the outlaw but we aint waiting no
longer than that

  all right said haggerty at the end of
the allotted time

  throw your guns out first came the
order

  i dont see the necessity for that ob-
jected haggerty one man wont start
anything with twenty-five

  the -you dont its me runnin

this game throw em out

  besides ive only got two guns said
haggerty evenly what do they matter
when there are fifty guns pointed at your
heads

  a moment of terrible silence during which
death waited on the decision of the outlaws
to surrender or give fight but there are few
symbols of eternal blackness so paralysing
as the black muzzle of a loaded revolver and
the tension was broken by sheehys joyful
voice

  bedad tis hard after wearin your feet
to the bones for twenty miles not to have
even the pleasure of a ruction haggerty
lad twas your golden trail that saved ye
and the mystery of the sound of hammerin
coming out of the solid face of a cliff and
now ye shpalpeens pay up to the miners
court the only court of no appeal

a month later rosa and hag-
gerty were leaning on the rail of a
small stream craft that plowed
westward around the curves of a wide and
beautiful river illimitable plains of green
and brown bordered that river on either
side stretching away until somewhere over
the curve of the earth they met distant blue
hills everywhere were washes of color
where the wild flowers grew orange and
blue and purple thousands upon thousands
of blackbirds dipped to meet the boat and
against the saffron sky were long lines of
waterfowl their necks outstretched


adventure

  it is a wonderful country said hag-
gerty with a note of sadness

  it is beautiful here assented rosa

  theres work and wealth here for mil-
lions said haggerty slowly the gold
is only the lure its the land that counts
some day therell be a city on that flat we
just passed and wheat from this valley
will feed it and help feed the world be-
sides its a kingdom men have come into
here

  in spite of himself he spoke wistfully
that for which he had come to this country
was finished doak was under guard below
and on the way to expiate the first of his
crimes but the country itself vast and new
fresh as from the hand of god and all fitted
for mans occupancy and struggles and
triumphs gripped at haggertys soul

  but you are leaving it said rosa with
a catch in her breath for me

  dear heart dont think i mind it said
haggerty swiftly

  he did but the land had treated rosa ill
and he knew how the settled orderliness of
her old home called to her

  but i do said rosa and i-ive been
thinking i learned a lot that last month in
grizzly i thought the miners were-were
savages jack but i found they were men
men needing maybe the influence of-of
people like you and me and i wouldnt
mind-i wouldnt-

  really the old old law was working upon
them both the law that bids a man cling to
his work and the woman to her man

  if you mean said haggerty gravely
that all this unsettled condition will pass
it will think how it was in grizzly where
we used the very wealth of the outlaws
stolen wealth to establish civil government
and pay the officers of law and order
thats the way it will be everywhere it
seems to me sometimes theres something
that turns everything to good even the
forces of evil but it will take time
would you be happy in the meantime
rosa

  with you questioned rosa and
then in an altogether different tone with
you jack anywhere and id rather
stay

the road to france

 by a moynahan

     oh the road to france is a long long road

      over the gray-green sea

      it stretches away to a far far land

     it takes you away from me

      oh the road to france is a sad sad road
      as it chafes in its ceaseless play

      as it tosses and rolls round the gallant ships
      with its waves so cruel and gray

      but the road to france is a glorious road
      where only the brave may go-

      where libertys sons with their starry flag
      will vanquish a hated foe

     and the road from france will be gay and glad
     when the sons of the free return

      and libertys lamp in the beautiful west
      will bright through the ages burn

        man wins then it swings the

- other way and a man loses

and men call it luck

  but is it

  ted carling threw two hundred pounds
of youthful ambition and four days grub
into the trail and broke out with the
stampede he was the last man ted
had been asleep when old pete johnson
finally succumbed to the ancient get-him-
drunk-enough-to-talk scheme and disclosed
the source of his bulky poke ted had
no hand in that but when he awoke to
the swift rasp of many feet in the snow
going by his cabin and learned the reason
for it the spirit-tube hanging outside
his window said thirty-five below when
he snapped the padlock on his cabin door
and swung into the trail

  ted grinned grimly before him in the
glow of the lights stretched out upon
the flats like a long black snake across the
glittering snow a line of fully fifty old-
timers and as many more newcomers like
himself drove leg muscles mercilessly
ahead of them forty miles straight north
lay old pete johnsons strike and poplar
creek forty miles north ten-twelve-

fourteen hours straight-away for those who
could stand the pace poplar creek lay
rigid in its winter bed its frost-expanding
waters somewhere along its course biting
off little knobs and big flakes of heavy dull-
yellow metal little knobs and big flakes
to carry down in the rotting ice in the
spring and sink to the bottom-on some-
bodys claim and ted had determined
to own one of those claims

  six feet even in his moccasins-legs
they called him-hard as twenty-two years
of strenuous honest living could pack him
fresh and eager from eight solid hours of
dreamless sleep ted ate up the trail
yard after yard after yard swiftly and
surely his pounding feet closed up the gap
between him and the tail of that long black
snake mile after mile of the creaking foot-
packed trail slipped away behind him
then he caught up

  three hours out ted caught up with
and passed with a nod a dozen panting
men panting weaklings who would soon
turn back two hours later he set the
pace for a team of trail-green new men
and laughed over his shoulder when he
bade them good-by a mile farther he
swung out to pass the leaders of the rear
half of the snake and when the brief




adventure

day edged up in the south there were just
six men ahead of him on the last five miles
to the creek

  old-timers those six were stampeders
in more than one rush and with the
wisdom of experience they had held well
back to the middle of the line to the trail
packcd to slide on then passing with a
sudden spurt the fagged trail-breakers
they strung out a quarter-mile apart in a
frenzied race across that last lap of five
miles of unbroken snow

  but they couldnt shake ted of average
height the six stepped exactly into each
others footprints-footprints too close to-
gether for teds long legs nevertheless
ted gained with every stride barring
accidents or trickery 

  but nothing was barred in the poplar
creek stampede the third man ahead
of ted stumbled and went down when
he got up he sat down again those imme-
diately behind him raced past ted
stopped

  all in he grinned

  all in- came the snarling answer

lookt that and he held up his right
foot

  the moccasin on that foot was slit the
full length of the sole and red with blood
and carefully buried in one of the hard-
packed imprints of the pounding feet ahead
pointed up and back the six-inch needle-
pointed blade of a game-knife

  ted dropped to his knee snorting his
surprise and disgust the next minute
he was on his feet again a dozen haggard
men raced past but he paid no attention
it was thirty-odd miles back to kellys
and this man couldnt travel

  a half-hour later ted threw his fifth huge
armful of wood down beside the roaring fire
and grabbed up his pack said he-

  ill be back as soon as i stake

  and he was back on the trail again

  there were eleven men in sight when the
leader of the stampede reached old pete
johnsons claim at the mouth of poplar
creek ted was the eleventh and the
eleventh five-hundred-foot claim would
place its owner over a mile up the creek
valley-over a mile away from the original
strike and that was too far

  old pete johnson was an old prospector
not a man of those there who knew him
but knew that old pete would cover the
whole creek before he settled down and

when old pete staked he would measure
off a full five hundred feet of the very heart
of the find if there was any color worth
working outside old petes claim it would
be found next to that claim up the creek-
the deep silent river flowed by on the other
side two or three claims up-stream-
there was a chance five or six-a possi-
bility but a mile up

  but ted didnt get the eleventh claim
a man behind him got that men behind
him got the eleventh and the twelfth and-
ted stood guard

reaching the mouth of poplar
creek ted found that one of those
ahead of him had jumped old pete
johnsons claim and was restaking it
whether or not he was the man who
had planted the knife in the trail ted
didnt know-no one ever knew anything
about that but that didnt matter ted
stopped

  blind cant see or what he chal-
lenged shortly didnt you see old petes
notice

  huh the jumper snorted old pete
aint never registered if he had wed a
heard o this before

  teds fingers in his mitt knotted to an
iron fist his long arm shot straight out
the first fight was on

  then with the arrival of the crowd came
the general mix-up

  axes bit off the stunted spruce and men
fought for the stakes grub-packs and
blankets were tossed aside and men fought
for position mitts were lost parkas
were torn off and men fought for breath
and when the flying snow finally settled
down again the creek was claimed up-
stream for a full three miles and only one
of the thirty who had lasted the forty
miles had failed to stake

  that man was ted

  ted stayed on old pete johnsons claim
down at kellys when old pete johnson
sobered enough to realize what his intoxi-
cated tongue had done he staggered into
the registry office and saved his clam
but ted didnt know that it needed but
five minutes of teds flying fists to send
the claim-jumper on up the creek but
there were others then when the race
back to register had left the creek deserted
and not till then ted moved

  when ted started anything he finished
luck



it just because he had come for that
purpose he staked a claim with his right
eye turning blue and rapidly closing and a
hopeless grin on his swollen features ted
walked three miles up the creek and mea-
sured off the last claim staked then he
started back

  the stampede was history when ted
registered that claim sixty hours after
the last man was in ted staggered into
kellys with yet another man across his
shoulders and that man had a right foot
swollen to three times its normal size the
frost had got into the knife-wound in the
sole

  and the men who had taken part in the
stampede the men who knew all the cir-
cumstances shrugged their shoulders and
said-

  tough luck

  then came the second stampede to
poplar creek and ted was in that
too

  the sun came back the ice broke up
and roared down to the river and poplar
creek was again a living stream men
waded out knee-deep into the numbing
waters with their pans washed sand and
cursed washed sand and cursed and went
back to kellys of the thirty-one who
had staked claims on poplar creek but six
stayed

  old pete johnson and the four men
above him washed sand and grinned but
three miles up the creek on the last claim
staked ted carling 

  ted climbed out on to the bank and
threw his pan into the bushes he wasnt
disappointed he had staked that claim
simply because he had mushed forty miles
for that purpose and he always finished

what he started he threw his long arms
above his head and yawned-and sat down
in the creek

  ted was a big man and heavy and the
throwing up of his long arms added sud-
denly to his weight the overhanging
bank he stood on sagged and tore loose

  the water was numbingly cold-the ice
had been out only a few days the creek
bottom was stony there-a hard seat but
ted sat still ted sat still and laughed

  old pete johnson and the four men
above him were standing out in the creek
they were panning sand and finding little
knobs and big flakes of gold where the
rotting ice that carried them down began
to drop them but ted carling sat in the
creek ted was staring at a big raw spot
where an overhanging bank had broken off
under his weight ted had staked the spot
where the frost-expanding waters of the
winter creek had bitten off all those little
knobs and big flakes

  and the men who took part in the
stampede the men who knew all the cir-
cumstances shrugged their shoulders and
said-

  great luck

  and ted claimed-

when ted carling got back to
his little home village his mother
backed him up into a corner and
demanded the reason for his sudden wealth
and ted laughed and said-

  oh just luck

e who lias not heard the bells of
san juan has a journey yet to
make he who has not set foot
upon the dusty road which is the
one street of san juan at times the most
silent and deserted of thoroughfares at
other times a most mad and turbulent lane
between sun-dried adobe walls may yet
learn something of man and his hopes de-
sires fears and ruder passions from a pin-
point upon the great southwestern map

  the street runs due north and south
pointing like a compass to the flat gray
desert in the one direction to the broken
hills swept up into the san juan mountains
in the other at the northern end that is
toward the more inviting mountains is the
old mission to right and left of the white-
washed corridors in a straggling garden of
pear-trees and olives and yellow roses are
two rude arches made of seasoned cedar
from the top cross-beam of each hang three
bells

  they have their history these bells of
san juan and the biggest with its deep
mellow voice the smallest with its golden
chimes seem to be chanting it when they
ring each swinging longue has its tale to
tell a tale of old spain of spanish galleons
and spanish gentlemen adventurers of
gentle-voiced priests and somber-eyed in-
dians of conquest revolt intrigue and sud-
den death

 when a baby is born in san juan a
rarer occurrence than a strong mans
death the littlest of the bells upon the
western arch laughs while it calls to all to
harken when a man is killed the angry-
toned bell pendant from the eastern arch
shouts out the word to go billowing across
the stretches of sage and greasewood and
gama grass if one of the later day frame
buildings bursts into flame ignacio chavez

elections the bell ringer cunningly makes
the bells talk

  out on the desert a man might stop and
listen forming his surmise as the sounds
surged out through the heat and silence
he might smile if he knew san juan as he
caught the jubilant message of the tones
tapped swiftly out of the bronze bell which
had come men said with coronado he
might sigh at the lugubrious slow swelling
voice of the big bell which had come hither-
ward long ago with the retinue of marco de
niza wondering what old friend or enemy
perchance had at last closed his ears to all
of ignacio chavezs music or at a sudden
fury of clanging the man far out on the
desert might hurry on cursing and goading
his burro impatiently to know what great
event had occurred in the old adobe town of
san juan

  it is three hundred and fifty years and
more since the six bells of san juan came
into the new world and tolled across that
land of quiet mystery which is the south-
west it is a hundred years since an all but
forgotten priest francisco calderon found
them in various devastated mission churches
assembled them and set them chiming in
the old garden where among the pear-
trees and olives and yellow roses they still
cast their shadows in sun and moonlight
in silence and in echoing chimes

chapter i

ignacio chavez mexican
that he styled himself indian
that the community deemed him
or breed of badly mixed blood that he
probably was made his loitering way along
the street toward the mission a thin
yellowish-brown cigarita dangling from his
lips his wide dilapidated conical hat tilted
to the left side of his head in a listless sort
of consession to the westering sun he was
as was customary with him utterly at
peace

  ten minutes ago he had had twenty
cents two minutes after the acquiring of
his elusive wealth he had exchanged the two
dimes for whisky at the casa blanca the
remaining eight minutes of the ten he re-
quired to make his way as he naively put it
between hell and heaven

  for from a corner of the peaceful old mis-
sion garden at one end of the long street one
might catch a glimpse of the casa blanca at

the other end sprawling in the sun between
the two sturdy walled buildings had the
town strung itself as it grew as old a relic
as the church itself was la casa blanca and
since san juan could remember in all mat-
ters antipodal to the religious calm of the
padres monument deep-shaded door-
ways let into the three-feet-thick earthen
walls waxed floors green tables and bar and
cool-looking glasses-a place which invited
lured held and frequently enough finally
damned

  san juan in the languid philosophy of
ignacio chavez was what you will it
epitomized the universe you had every-
thing here which the soul of man might
covet never having dwelt elsewhere since
his mother bore him here upon the rim of the
desert and with the san juan mountains
so near that ignacio chavez pridefully
knew a man standing upon the mesa alta
might hear the ringing of his bells he expe-
rienced a pitying contempt for all those
other spots in the world which were so
plainly less favored

  what do you wish senor fine warm
days you have them here nice cool
nights for sound slumber right here in
san juan amigo mio a desert across
which the eye may run without stopping
until it be tired a wonderful desert whereon
at dawn and dusk god weaves all of the
alluring soft mists of mystery shaded
canons at noonday with water and birds and
flowers behold the mountains every-
thing desirable in short

  that there might be men who desired the
splash of waves the sheen of wet beaches
the boom of surf did not suggest itself to
one who had never seen the ocean so then
san juan was what you will a man
may fix his eye upon the little mission cross
which is always pointing to heaven and god
or he may pass through the shaded doors of
the casa blanca which men say give exit
into hell the shortest way

  ignacio having meditatively enjoyed his
whisky and listened smilingly to the tinkle
of a mandolin in the patio under a grape-
vine arbor had rolled his cigaret and turned
his back square upon the devil-of whom he
no longer had anything to ask as he went
out he stopped in the doorway long enough
to rub his back against a comer of the wall
and to strike a match then almost in-
audibly humming the mandolin air he
slouched out into the burning street


adventure

  for twenty years he had striven with the
weeds in the mission garden and no man
during that time dared say which had had
the best of it ignacio chavez or the inter-
loping alfileria and purslane in the mat-
ters of a vast leisureliness and tumbling
along the easiest way they resembled each
other these two avowed enemies

  for twenty years he had looked upon the
bells as his own had filled his eye with
them day after day had looked the first
thing in the morning to see that they were
there regarding them as solicitously in the
rare rainy weather as his old mother re-
garded her few mongrel chicks twenty
full years and yet ignacio chavez was
not more than thirty years old or thirty-
five perhaps he did not know no one
cared

  he was on his way to attack with his bare
brown hands some of the weeds which were
spilling over into the walk which led through
the garden and to the priests house as a
matter of fact he had awakened with this
purpose in mind had gone his lazy way all
day fully purposing to give it his attention
and had at last arrived upon the scene

  the front gate had finally broken the
upper hinge worn out ignacio carefully set
the ramshackly wooden affair back against
the fence thinking how one of these days he
would repair it then he went between the
bigger pear-tree and the lluvia doro which
his own hands had planted here and stood
with legs well apart considering the three
bells upon the easterly arch

  que hay amigos he greeted them
do you know what i am going to do for
you some fine day i will build a little roof
over you that runs down both ways to shut
out the water when it rains it will make
you hoarse too much rain

  that was one of the few dreams of igna-
cios life one day he was going to make a
little roof over each arch but today he
merely regarded affectionately the captain
-that was the biggest of the bells-the
dancer second in size and lolita the
smallest upon this arch then he sighed
and turned toward the other arch across the
garden to see how it was with the little
one la golondrina and ignacio chavez
for it was only fair that at least one of the
six should bear his name

  changing his direction thus moving di-
rectly toward the dropping sun he shifted
his hat well over his eyes and so was con-

strained to note how the weeds were assert-
ing themselves with renewed insolence he
muttered a soft malditol at them winch
might have been mistaken for a caress and
determined upon a merciless campaign of
extermination just as soon as he could have
fitted a new handle to his hoe

  then he paused in front of the mission
steps and lifted his hat made an elegant
bow and smiled in his own inimitable re-
markably fascinating way for under the
ragged brim his eyes had caught a glimpse
of a pretty pair of patent-leather slippers a
prettier pair of black stockinged ankles and
the hem of a white starched skirt

  nowhere are there eyes like the eyes of
old mexico deep and soft and soulful
though the man himself may have a soul
like a bit of charred leather velvety and
tender though they may belong to an out-
and-out cutthroat expressive eloquent
even though they are the eyes of a peon
with no mind to speak of night black and
like the night filled with mystery ignacio
chavez lifted such eyes to the eyes of the
girl who had been watching him and spon-
taneously gave her the last iota of his ready
admiration

  it is a fine day senorita he told her
displaying two glistening rows of superb
teeth friendliwise and the garden-ah
que es mas bonita en lodo el mundo you
like it no

  it was slow music when ignacio chavez
spoke all liquid sounds and tender cadences
when he had cursed the weeds it was like
love-making a d in his mouth became
a softened th from the lips of such as
the bell-ringer of san juan the snapping
gringo oath comes metamorphosed into a
gentle gah-tham the girl to whom
the speech of chavez was something as
new and strange as the face of the earth
about her regarded him with grave curious
eyes

she was seated upon the little
bench against the mission wall
which no one but ignacio guessed
was to be painted green one of these fine
days a bronze-haired gray-eyed girl in
white skirt and waist and with a wide pana-
ma hat caught between her clasped hands
and her knee for a moment she was per-
haps wondering how to take him then with
a suddenness that had been all unheralded
in her former gravity she smiled with
the bells of san juan

i

lips and eyes together as though she ac-
cepted his friendship ignacios own smile
broadened and he nodded his delight

  it is truly beautiful here she ad-
mitted and had ignacio possessed a tithe of
that sympathetic comprehension which his
eyes lied about he would have detected a
little note of eagerness in her voice would
even have guessed that she was lonely and
craved human companionship i have
been sitting here an hour or two you are
not going to send me away are you
ignacio looked properly horrified

  if i saw an angel here in the garden
senorita he exclaimed would i say sape
to it no no senorita here you shall stay
a thousand years if you wish i swear it
he was all sincerity ignacio chavez
would no sooner think of being rude to a
beautiful young woman than of crying
scat to an angel but as to staying here
a thousand years-she glanced through the
tangle of the garden to the tiny grave-
yard and shook her head

  you have just come to san juan he
asked today

  yes she told him on the stage at
noon

  you have friends here

  again she shook her head

  ah said ignacio

  he straightened for a brief instant and
she could see how the chest under his shirt
inflated

  a tourist you have heard of this gar-
den maybe and the bells so you
traveled across the desert to see

  the third time she shook her head

  i have come to live here she returned
quietly

  but not all alone senorita

  yes she smiled at him again all
alone

  mother of god he said within himself
and presently to her i did not see the
stage come today in san juan one takes
his siesta at that hour and it is not often
that the stage brings new people from the
railroad

  in some subtle way he had made of his
explanation an apology while his slow
brown fingers rolled a cigaret he stared away
through the garden and across the desert
with an expression half-melancholy half-
merely meditative which made the girl
wonder what his thoughts were when she
came to know him better she would know

too that at times like this he was not think-
ing at all

  i think that this is the most profoundly
peaceful place in the world said the girl
quietly half-listlesslv setting into words the
impression which had clung about her
throughout the long still day it is like
a strange dream town one sees no one mov-
ing about hears nothing it is just a little
sad isnt it

  he had followed her until the end com-
prehending but sad how was that it
was just as it should be to ears which had
never been filled with the noises or rushing
trains and cars and all of the traffic of a city
what sadness could there be in the very
natural calm of the rim of the desert
having no satisfactory reply to make igna-
cio merely muttered si senorita some-
what helplessly and let it go at that

  tell me she continued sitting up a
little and seeming to throw off the oppres-
sively heavy spell of her environment
who are the important people here-
abouts

  la geiite oh ignacio knew them well
all of them there was senor engle to be-
gin with the banker of whom no doubt
she had heard he owned a big residencia
just yonder you could catch the gleam of
its white walls through a clump of cotton-
woods withdrawn aloofly from san juans
street many men worked for him he had
big cattle and sheep ranches throughout the
country he paid well and loaned out much
money also he had a beautiful wife and a
truly marvelously beautiful daughter and
horses such as one could not look upon
elsewhere

  then there was senor nortone as ignacio
pronounced him a sincere friend of ignacio
chavez and a man fearless and true and
extravagantly to be admired who it ap-
peared was the sheriff not a family man
lie was too young yet but soon oh one
could see it would be ignacio who would
ring the bells for the wedding when rode-
rico married himself with the daughter of
the banker

  he is what you call a gunman isnt
he asked the girl interested i heard
two of the men on the stage talking of him
they called him roddy norton he is the
one isnt he

  seguro sure he was the one a gun-
man ignacio shrugged he was sheriff
and what must a sheriff be if not a gunman


adventure

  on the stage continued the girl was a
man they called doc and another named
galloway they are san juan men are
they not

  ignacio lifted his brows a shade dis-
dainfully they were both san juan citi-
zens but obviously not to his liking jim
galloway was a big man yes but of la
genie never the setiorila should look the
other way when he passed he owned the
casa blanca that was enough to ticket him
and ignacio passed quickly to el senor
doctor oh he was smart and did much good
to the sick but the poor mexican who
called him for a bed-ridden wife must first
sell something and show the money

  beyond these it appeared that the envi-
able class of san juan consisted of the
padre jose who was at present and much
of the time away visiting the poor and sick
throughout the countryside julius struve
who owned and operated the local hotel one
of the lesser luminaries though a portly
gentleman with an amiable wife the por-
ters who had a farm off to the northwest and
whose connection to san juan lay in the
fact that an old maid daughter taught the
school here various other individuals and
family groups to be disposed of with a word
and a careless wave of a cigaret already
for the fair stranger ignacio had skimmed
the cream of the cream

  the girl sighed as though her question
had been no idle one and his reply had disap-
pointed her for a moment her brows
gathered slightly into a frown that was
like a faint shadow then she smiled
again brightly a quick smile which seemed
more at home in her eyes than the frown had
been

  ignacio glanced from her to the weeds
then squinting his eyes at the sun there
was ample time it would be cooler pres-
ently so describing a respectful arc about
her he approached the mission wall slipped
into the shade and eased himself in charac-
teristic indolence against the white-washed
adobe she appeared willing to talk with
him well then what pleasanter way to
spend an afternoon she sought to learn
this and that of a land new to her who to
explain more knowingly than ignacio
chavez

  after a little when she rose to go he
would pluck some of the newly opened yel-
low rosebuds for her making her a little
speech about herself and budding flowers

he would even perhaps show her his bells
let her hear just the suspicion of a note from
each

  a sharp sound which came to her ab-
ruptly out of the utter stillness meant noth-
ing to her she saw a flock of pigeons rise
above the roofs of the more distant of the
houses circle swerve and disappear beyond
the cottonwoods she noted that ignacio
was no longer leaning lazily against the
wall that he had stiffened that his mouth
was a little open breathless his attitude
that of one listening expectantly his eyes
squinting as they had been just now when
he fronted the sun

  then came the second sound a repetition
of the first sharp in some way sinister
then another and another and another un-
til she lost count a mans voice crying out
strangely muffled indistinct seeming to
come from afar

  it was an incongruous almost a humorous
thing to see the sun-warmed passivity of
ignacio chavez metamorphosed in a flash
into activity he had muttered something
had leaped away from the mission wall
dashed through the tangle of the garden and
raced like a madman to the eastern arch
with both hands he grasped the dangling
bell ropes with all of his might he had set
them clanging and shouting and clamoring
until the reverberation smote her ears and
set the blood strangely tingling through her
she had seen the look upon his face

  suddenly she knew that those little sharp
sounds had been the rattle of pistol shots
she sprang to her feet her eyes widening
her cheeks growing pale now all was
quiet save for the boom and roar of the
bells the pigeons were circling high in the
clear sky were coming back she went
quickly the way ignacio had gonj calling
out to him-

  what is it

  he seemed all unmoved now as he made
his bells cry out for him it was for him to be
calm while they trembled with the event
which surely they must understand

  it is a man dead he told her as his
right hand called upon the captain for a
volume of sound from his bronze throat
you will see and there will be more
work for rodericonortone he sighed and
shook his head and for a moment spoke
softly with his jangling bells and some
day he continued quietly it will be
rodericos time no and i will ring the
the bells of san juan



bells for him and the captain and the dan-
cer and lolita they will all put tears into
mens eyes but first santa maria let it
be that i ring the others for him when he
marries himself with the bankers daugh-
ter

  a man dead the girl repeated un-
willing to grasp fully

   you will see returned ignacio

chapter ii

the girl in the old mission gar-
den stood staring at ignacio chavez
a long time seeming compelled by a
force greater than her own to watch him
tugging and jerking at his bells plainly
enough she understood that this was an
alarm being sounded a man dead through
violence and the bell-ringer stirring the
town with it but when presently he let
two of the ropes slip out of his hands and
began a slow mournful tolling of the cap-
tain alone she shuddered a little and with-
drew

  that it might be merely a case of a man
wounded even badly wounded did not
once suggest itself to her ignacio had
spoken as one who knew in full confidence
and with finality she should see she
went back to the little bench which one day
was to be a bright green and sat down
she could see that again the pigeons were
circling excitedly that from the baking
street little puffs of dust arose to hang idly
in the still air as though they were painted
upon the clear canvas of the sky she
heard the voices of men faint quick sounds
against the tolling of the bell then sud-
denly all was very still once more ignacio
had allowed the captain to resume his silent
brooding and came to her

   i must go to see who it is he apologized
then i will know better how to ring for
him the sheepman from las palmas i
bet you for did i not see when just now i
passed the casa blanca that he was a little
drunk with senor galloways whisky
and does not every one know he sold many
sheep and that means much money these
days si senorita it will be the sheepman
from las palmas

   he was gone slouching along again and in
no haste now that he had fulfilled his first
duty what haste could there possibly be
since sheepman from las palmas or an-
other he was dead and therefore must wait

upon ignacio chavezs pleasure some-
how she gleaned this thought from his man-
ner and therefore did not speak as she
watched him depart

   that portion of the street which she could
see from where she sat was empty the dust
settling thinning disappearing further
down toward the casa blanca she could
imagine the little knots of men asking one
another what had happened and how the
chief actor in this fragment of human drama
she could picture lying inert uncaring that
it was for him that a bell had tolled and
would toll again that men congregated
curiously

  in a little while ignacio would return
shuffling smoking a dangling cigaret his
hat cocked against the sun he would give
her full particulars and then return to his
bell

  she had come to san juan to make a
home here to become a part of it to make it
a portion of her to arrive upon a day like
this was no pleasant omen it was too dread-
fully like taking a room in a house only to
hear the life rattling out of a man beyond a
partition she was suddenly averse to
hearing ignacios details there came a
quick desire to set her back to the town
whose silence on the heels of uproar
crushed her

  rising hastily she went with quick steps
down the weed-bordered walk out at the
broken gate and turned toward the moun-
tains one glance down the street as she
crossed it showed her what she had ex-
pected a knot of men at the door of the
casa blanca another small group at a win-
dow evidently taking stock of a broken
window-pane

  the sun angry and red was hanging low
over a distant line of hills the face of the
fiat lands were already drawing about them
a thin faintly colorful haze she had put
on her hat and like ignacio had set it a
little to the side of her head feeling her
cheeks burning when the direct rays found
them the fine loose soil was sifting into
her low slippers before she had gone a score
of paces when she came back she would
unpack her trunk and get out a sensible pair
of boots no doubt she was dressed ridic-
ulously but then the heat had tempted
her

   a curious matter presented itself to her
in the little groups upon the street she had
not seen a single woman were there none


adventure

in san juan was this some strange alto-
gether masculine community which she had
stumbled into then she remembered
how the bell-ringer had mentioned mrs
engle the bankers wife and his daughter
and mrs struve and others besides all
this she had a letter to mrs engle which she
was going to present this evening

  she was thinking of anything in the world
but of a tragedy not yet grown cold so near
her that for a little it had seemed to em-
brace her now it was almost as though it
had not occurred the world was all un-
changed about her the town somnolent
she had shuddered as ignacio played upon
his bell but the shudder was rather from
the bells resonant eloquence than from any
more vital cause

  a man she had never seen whose name
even she did not know had been shot by
another man unknown to her she had heard
only the shots she had seen nothing
true she had heard also a voice crying out
but she sensed that it had been the voice of
an onlooker she felt ashamed that the
episode did not move her more

  as earlier in the afternoon she had been
drawn from the heat of her room at struves
hotel by the shade to be found in the mission
garden so now did a long wavering line of
cottonwoods beckon to her in files which
turned eastward or westward here and there
only to come back to the general northerly
trend they indicated where an arroyo
writhed down tortured-serpent-wise from
the mountains through their foliage she
had glimpsed the engle home she ex-
pected to find running water under their
shade that and an attendant coolness

  but the arroyo proved to be dry and hot
a gap in the dry bosom of the earth its bot-
tom strewn with smooth pebbles and sand
and a very sparse unattractive vegetation
stunted and harsh and it was almost as
hot here as on san juans street into the
shade crept the heat waves of the dry
scorched air

  led by the line of cottonwoods seeking
action rather than coolness yet craving
both she found a little path and followed it
experiencing a vague relief to have the little
town at her back she knew that distances
deceived the eye in this bleak land and yet
she thought that before dark she could
reach the hills idle there where perhaps
there were a few languid flowers and pools
returning just tired enough to eat and go

to sleep she rather thought that she
woukl postpone her call on the engles until
tomorrow

  its manana-land after all she told
herself with a quick smile

  half an hour later she found a spot where
the trees stood in a denser growth looking
greener more vigorous-less thirsty she
could fancy the great roots questing far
downward through the layers of dry soil
thrusting themselves almost with a human
passionate eagerness into the water they
had found here she threw herself down
lying upon her back gazing up through the
branches and leaves

  never until now had she known the mean-
ing of utter stillness she saw a bird a poor
brown unkempt little being it had no song
to offer the silence and in a little while flew
away listlessly she had seen a rabbit
a big gaunt uncomely wretch of a thing
disappearing silently among the clumps of
brush

  her spirit essentially bright and happy
had striven hard with a new form of weari-
ness all day not only was she coming into
another land than that which she knew and
understood she was entering another phase
of her life she had chosen voluntarily
without device or suggestion she had had
her reasons and they had seemed sufficient
they were still sufficient she had chosen
wisely she held to that her judgment un-
troubled

  but that stubbornly recurrent sense that
with the old landmarks she had abandoned
the old life that both in physical fact and in
spiritual and mental actuality she was at the
threshold of an unguessed essentially differ-
ent life was disquieting there is no get-
ting away from an oldbasic truth that a
mans life is so strongly influenced as almost
to be molded by his environment there
was uneasiness in the thought that here
ones existence might grow to resemble his
habitat taking on the gray tone and mo-
notony and bleak barrenness of this sun-
smitten land

  yielding a little already to the command
laid upon breathing nature hereabouts she
was lying still her hands lax her thoughts
taking unto themselves something of the
character of the listless songless brown
birds flight she had come here today
following in the footsteps of other men and a
few women her own selection of san
juan was explicable the thing to wonder at
the bells of san juan



was what had given the hardihood to the
first men to stop here and make houses and
then homes

  later she would know the one magic
word of the desert lands water for san
juan standing midway between the rail-
road and the more tempting lands beyond
the mountains had found birth here because
there was a mudhole for cradle down under
the sand were fortuitous layers of impervi-
ous clay cupping to hold much sweet water

hthe slow tolling of a bell came
billowing out through the silence
the girl sat up it was the cap-
tain never it seemed to her had she
heard anything so mournful ignacio had
informed himself concerning all details and
had returned to the garden at the mission
the man was dead then there could be
no doubt as one listened to the measured
sorrowing of the big bell

  she got to her feet and walking swiftly
moved on still further away from san juan
the act was without premeditation her
whole being was insistent upon it she
wondered if it was the sheepman from las
palmas if he had perhaps a wife and
children then she stopped suddenly a
new thought had come to her strange
inexplicable even it had not suggested it-
self before

  she wondered who the other man was the
man who had done the killing and what
had happened to him had he fled had
other men grappled with him disarmed him
made of him a prisoner to answer for what
he had done what had been his motive
what passion had actuated him surely
not just the greed for gold which the bell-
ringer had suggested what sort of a crea-
ture was he who in cold calculating blood
could murder a man for a handful of
money

  there was nothing to answer unless she
could catch the thought of ignacio chavez
in the ringing of his bell she moved on
again hurrying

  following the arroyo she had come to the
first of the little smooth hills the lomas as
the men on the stage had named them
through them the dry watercourse wrig-
gled carrying its green pennons along its
marge she went up gentle slopes mantled
with bleached grass which under her eyes
was white in the glare of the sun but the
sun was very low now very fierce and red

an angry god going down in temporary de-
feat but defiant to the last filled with threat
for tomorrow

  the far western uplands cut the great
disc squarely in two down slipped the half-
wafer until it seemed that just a bright
signal-fire was kindled upon the ridge
and as that faded from her eyes the slow
sobbing of the swinging bell was like a wail
for the death of the day

  she had removed her hat fancying that
already the earth was throwing off its heat
that a little coolness and freshness was com-
ing down to meet her from the mountains
she turned her eyes toward them and then
just after the sunset it was that she saw a
man riding toward her he was still far off
when she first glimpsed him half or
three-quarters of a mile just cresting one of
the higher hills so that for him the sun had
not yet set for she caught the glint of
light flaming back from the silver chasings
of his bridle and from the barrel of the gun
across the hollow of his left arm she did
not believe that he had seen her in the
shadow of the cottonwoods

  if she went on sh must meet him pres-
ently she glanced back over her shoulder
noting how far she had come from the town
it was very still again the bell had ceased
its complaint the hoofs of the approaching
horse seemed shod with felt falling upon
felt she swung about and walked back
toward san juan

  a little later she heard the mans voice
calling clearly to her since there was no
one else why should he call to her she
gave no sign of having heard but walked on
a trifle faster she sensed that he was gal-
loping down upon her sensed merely for
still in the loose sand the hoofbeats were
muffled then he called again and she
stopped and turned and waited

  a splendid big fellow he was she noted
as he came on riding a splendid big horse
man and beast seemed to belong to the
desert had it not been for the glint of the
sun she realized now she would probably not
have distinguished their distant forms from
the land across which they had moved
the horse was a darkish dull gray the
man boots corduroy breeches soft shirt
and hat was garbed in gray or so covered
with the dust of travel as to seem so

  what in the world are you doing way out
here he called to her and then having
come closer he reined in his horse stared at


adventure

her a moment in surprised wonderment
swept off his hat and said a shade awk-
wardly i beg pardon i thought you
were some one else

  for her wide hat was again drooping
about her face and he had had just the form
of hor and the white skirt and waist to
judge by

  it is all right she said lightly i
imagined that you had made a mistake

  it was something of a victory over herself
to have succeeded in speaking thus care-
lessly for there had been the impulse a
temptation almost just to stare back at the
man as he had stared at her and in silence
not only was the type physically magnifi-
cent to her it was like everything about
her new and that which had held her at
first was his eyes

  for it is not the part of youth to be stern-
eyed and while this man could not be more
than midway between twenty and thirty
his eyes had already acquired the trick of
being hard steely suggesting relentlessness
stern and quick tall lean-bodied with
big calloused hands as brown as an indian
hair and eyes were uncompromisingly black
he belonged to the southwestern wastes

  these things she noted and that his face
looked drawn and weary that about his left
hand was tied a handkerchief hinting at a
minor cut that his horse looked as travel-
worn as himself

  one doesnt see strangers often around
san juan he explained as for a girl-
well i never made a mistake like this be-
fore ill have to look out

  the muscles of the tired face softened a
little into his eyes came a quick light that
was good to see for an instant masking their
habitual sternness

  if youll excuse me again and if you
dont know a whole lot about this country
- he paused to measure her sweepingly
seemed satisfied and concluded-i wouldnt
go out all alone like this especially after
sundown were a rather tough lot you
know good-by

  he had lifted his hat again loosened his
horses reins and passed by her just as she
had expected just as she had desired
and yet with his dusty back turned upon
her she experienced a sudden return of her
loneliness would she ever look into the
eyes of a friend again could she ever ac-
tually accomplish what she had set out to
accomplish make san juan a home

  her eyes followed him frankly admiring
now so she might have looked at any other
of natures triumphant creations then
before he had gone a score of yards she saw
how a little tightening of his horses reins
had brought the big brute down from a
swinging gallop to a dead standstill the
bell was tolling again

  again he was calling to her again swing-
ing about he had ridden to her side and
his voice now like his eyes was ominously
stem

  who is it he demanded

  i dont know she told him marvelling
at the look on his face his emotion was
purely one of anger mounting anger that a
man was dead the man who rings the
bells told me that he thought it must be a
sheepman from las palmas he went to
see-i didnt wait

  nor did this man wait now again he
had wheeled now he was racing along the
arroyo urging a tired horse that he might
lose no unnecessary handful of moments
and as he went she heard him curse savagely
under his breath and knew that he had for-
gotten her in the thoughts which had been
released by the dull booming of a bell

chapter iii

in the bar at the casa blanca
a long wide room low-ceilinged and
with cool sprinkled floor a score or
more men had congregated for the most
part they were silent content to look at the
signs left by the recent shooting and to have
what scraps of explanation were vouch-
safed them and these were meager
enough the man who had done the shoot-
ing was sullen and self-contained the
dead man-it was the sheepman from
las palmas-lay in an adjoining card-
room stark under the blanket which the
large hands of jim galloway had drawn over
him

  when the clatter of hoofs rang out in the
street a couple of men went to the door

  it is the sheriff they said coming
back

  roderick norton entering swiftly his
spurs dragging and jangling swept the faces
in the room with eyes which had in them
none of that human glint of good-will which
the girl at the arroyo had glimpsed in them
again they were steely angry bespeaking
both threat and suspicion
the bells of san juan



  who is it this time he demanded
sharply

  bisbee from las palmas they told him
who did it came the quick question
and then before an answer could come his
voice ringing with the anger in it-
antone or kid rickard which one
he had shifted his rifle so that it was
caught up under his left arm his right
hand frank and unhidden rested upon the
butt of the heavy-caliber revolver sagging
from his belt standing just within the
room he had stepped to one side of the door-
way so that the wall was at his back

  it was the kid some one answered
and was continuing he says it was self-

defense-

  norton cut in bluntly-

	was gallowav here when it happened
  yes

  wheres galloway now

  it was noteworthy that he asked for jim
galloway rather than for kid rickard

  in there they told him indicating a
second card-room adjoining that in which
the las palmas sheepman lay rod nor-
ton again glancing sharply across the faces
confronting him went to the closed door and
set his hand to the knob but jim gallo-
way having desired privacy just now had
locked the door norton struck it sharply
commanding

  open up galloway its norton
there came the low mutter of a voice
hasty and with the quality of stern exhorta-
tion the snap of the lock and the door was
jerked open nortons eyes probing into
every square foot of the chamber took stock
of jim galloway and beyond him of kid
rickard slouching forward in a chair and
rolling a cigaret

  hello norton said galloway tone-
lessly glad you showed up theres
been trouble

  a heavy man above the waist-line thick-
shouldered with large head and bull throat
his muscular torso tapered down to clean-
lined hips his legs of no greater girth than
those of the lean-bodied man confronting
him his feet small in glove-fitting boots
his eyes prominent and full and a clear
brown were a shade too innocent chin
jaw and mouth the latter full-lipped were
those of strength smashing power and a
natural cruelty he was the one man to be
found in san juan who was dressed as the
rather fastidiously inclined business men

dress in the cities

  another man down galloway said
norton with an ominous sternness and
in your place how long do you think that
you can keep out from under

  his meaning was plain enough the men
behind him in the barroom listened in atti-
tudes which varying in other matters were
alike in their tenseness galloway how-
ever staring stonily with eyes not unlike
polished agate so cold and steady were
they gave no sign of taking offense

  you and i never were friends rod
norton he said unmoved still thats
no reason you should jump me for trouble
answering your question i expect to keep
out from under just as long as two things
remain as they are first as long as i play
the game square and in the open next as
long as an overgrown boy holds down the
job of sheriff in san juan

  in nortons eyes was blazing hatred in
galloways mere steady unwinking bold-
ness

  you saw the killing the sheriff asked
curtly

  yes said galloway

  the kid there did it

  for the first time the man sloucliing for-
ward in the chair lifted his head had a
stranger looked in at that moment curious
to see him who has just committed homi-
cide-or murder-he must have experienced
a positive shock sullen-eyed sullen-lip-
ped the man-killer could not yet have seen
the last of his teens a thin wisp of straw-
colored hair across a low atavistic forehead
unhealthy yellowish skin with pale lack-
luster faded blue eyes he looked evil and
vicious and cruel

  one looking from him to jim galloway
would have suspected that one could be as
inhuman as the other but with the difference
that that which was but means to an end
with galloway would be end in itself to
kid rickard something of the primal
savage shone in the pale fires of his eyes

  yes retorted the kid his surly voice
little better than a snarl i got him and be
damned to him

  bad luck cursing a dead man rickard
said norton coldly what did you kill
him for

  kid rickards tongue ran back and forth
between his colorless lips before he replied

  he tried to get me first he said
defiantly


adventure

who saw the shooting

jim galloway and antone

 rod norton grunted his disgust with the
 situation

give me your gun he commanded
tersely

the kid frowned galloway
cleared his throat rickards eyes
went to him swiftly then he got
to his feet jerked a thirty-eight caliber
revolver from the hip-pocket of his overalls
and held it out surrendering it reluctantly
norton broke it ejecting the cartridges
into his palm not an empty shell among
them the kid had slipped in a fresh shell for
every exploded one

how many times did you shoot

i dont know two or three i guess

-it do you imagine a man counts em

what were you and galloway doing
alone in here with the door locked

galloway cut in sharply-

 i didnt want any more trouble i was

afraid somebody-

 shut up will you cried the sheriff
 fiercely ill give you all the chance to
 talk you want pretty soon answer me
 rickard

 i told him to lock me up somewhere until
 you or tom cutter come said the kid
 slowly i was afraid somebody might
 jump me for what i done i didnt want
 no more trouble

norton turned briefly to the crowded
room behind him

anybody know where cutter is he
asked

it appeared that every one knew tom
cutter rod nortons deputy had gone in
the early morning to mesa verde and would
probably return in the cool of the evening
frowning norton made the best of the
situation and to gain his purpose called four
men out of the crowd

 i want you boys to do me a favor he
 said antone come here

 the short squat half-breed standing be-
 hind the bar lifted his heavy black brows
 demanding

f porque what am i to do

as you are told norton snapped at
him benny you and dick walk down
the street with antone you other boys walk
down the other way with rickard if they
havent had all the chance to talk together
already that they want dont give them any

more opportunity step up rickard

  the kid sulked but under the look the
sheriff turned on him he came forward and
went out of the door his whole attitude re-
maining one of defiance antone his swart
face as expressionless as a piece of ma-
hogany hesitated glanced at galloway
shrugged and did as rickard had done going
out between his two guards the men
remaining in the barroom were watching
their sheriff expectantly he swung about
upon galloway

  now he said quickly who fired the
first shot galloway

  galloway smiled went to his bar poured
himself a glass of whisky and standing there
the glass twisting slowly in his fingers
stared back innocently at his interrogator

  trying the case already judge nor-
ton he inquired equably

will you answer norton said coolly
sure galloway kept his look steady
upon the sheriffs and into the innocence of
his eyes there came a veiled insolence
bisbee shot first

  where was he standing

  galloway pointed

  right there

  the spot indicated was about three or
four feet from where norton stood near the
second card-room door

  where was the kid

  over there again galloway pointed
clean across the room over by where the
chair is tumbled over against the table
how many times did bisbee shoot
galloway seemed to be trying to remem-
ber he drank his whisky slowly reached
over the bar for a cigar upon the shelf under
it and answered

  twice or three times

  how many times did rickard shoot
im not sure id say about the same
two or three times

  where was antone standing

  behind the bar down at the far end
nearest the door

  where were you

  leaning against the bar talking to
antone

  what were you talking about

  this question came quicker sharper than
the others as though calculated to startle
galloway into a quick answer but the
proprietor of the casa blanca was lighting
his cigar and took his time when he
looked up his eyes told norton that he had
the bells of san juan



  understood any danger which might lie
under a question so simple in the seeming
his eyes were smiling contemptuously but
there was a faint flush in his cheeks

  i dont remember he replied at last
some trifle the shooting coming sud-
denly that way-

  what started the ruction

  bisbee had been drinking a little he
seemed to be in the devils own temper
he had asked the kid to have a drink with
him and rickard refused he had his
drink alone and then invited the kid again
rickard told him to go to hell bisbee
started to walk across the room as though he
was going to the card-room then he
grabbed his gun and whirled around and
started shooting

  missing every time of course
  galloway nodded

  youll remember i said he was carrying
enough of a load to make his aim bad
norton asked half a dozen further ques-
tions and then said abruptly

  thats all as you go out will you tell
the boys to send antone in

  again a hint of color crept slowly dully
into galloways cheeks

  youre going pretty far rod norton
he said tonelessly

  youre-right i am cried norton

ringingly and i am going a lot further
jim galloway before i get through and you
can bet all of your blue chips on it i want
antone in here and i want you outside
do i get what i want or not

  galloway stood motionless his cigar
clamped tight in his big square teeth
then he shrugged and went to the door

  if i am standing a good deal off of you
he muttered hanging on his heel just before
he passed out its because i am as strong
as any man in the county to see the law
brought into san juan and for the first
time yielding outwardly to a display of the
emotion riding him he spat out venomously
and tauntingly and wed have had the
law here long ago had we had a couple of
men in the boots of the nortons father and
son

  rod nortons face went a flaming red
with anger his hand grew white upon the
butt of the gun at his side

  some day jim galloway he said
steadily ill get you just as sure as you
got billy norton

  galloway laughed and went out

jllllll to antone norton put the
j identical questions he had asked of
galloway receiving virtually the
same replies seeking the one opportunity
suggesting itself into tricking the bartender
he asked at the end

  just before the shooting when you and
galloway were talking and he told you that
bisbee was looking for trouble why werent
you ready to grab him when he went for his
gun

   antone was giving his replies as guardedly
as galloway had done he took his time
now

   because he began finally i do not be-
lief when senor galloway speak that-

  his eyes had been roving from nortons
going here and there about the room sud-
denly a startled look came into them and he
snapped his mouth shut

   go on prompted the sheriff

  i dont remember grunted antone
i forget what senor galloway say what i
say bisbee say have a drink the kid
say go to hell bisbee shoot one two
three like that i forget what we talk
about

  norton turned slowly and looked whither
antone had been looking when he cut his
own words off so sharply the man upon
whom his eyes rested longest was a creased-
face mexican vidal nunez who stood head-
down now making a cigaret

  thats all antone norton said send
the kid in

   the kid came still sullen but swaggering
a little his hat cocked jauntily to one
side the yellow wisp of hair in his faded
eyes and he in turn questioned gave
such answers as the two had given before
him

   for the first time now the sheriff stepping
across the room looked for such evidence as
flying lead might have left for him in the
wall just behind the spot where bisbee had
stood were two bullet-holes going to the
far end of the room where the chair leaned
against the table he found that a pane of
glass in the window opening upon the street
had been broken there were no bullet-
marks upon wall or woodwork

  bisbee shot two or three times did he
he cried wheeling on the kid and missed
every time and all the bullets went
through the one hole in the window i sup-
pose

  the kid shrugged insolently


adventure

i didnt watch em he returned briefly
galloway and antone were allowed to
come again into the room and of galloway
quite as though no hot word had passed be-
tween them norton asked quietly

  bisbee had a lot of money on him
what happened to it

  in there galloway nodded toward
the card-room whose door had remained
closed in his pocket

  a few of the morbid followed as he went
into the little room most of the men had
already seen and had no further curiosity
norton drew the blanket away noted the
wounds three of them two at the base of
the throat and one just above the left eye
then going through the sheepmans pock-
ets he brought out a handful of coins a
few gold most of them silver dollars and
half-dollars in all a little over fifty dollars

  the dead man lay across two tables
drawn up together his booted feet sticking
out stolidly beyond the bed still too short to
accommodate his length of body nor-
tons eyes rested on the mans boots longer
than upon the cold face then stepping
back to the door so that all in the barroom
might catch the significance of his words he
said sharply

  how many men of you know where bis-
bee always carried his money when he was
on his way to bank

  in his boots answered two voices to-
gether

  come this way boys take a look at
his boots will you

  and as they crowded about the table
sensing some new development galloway
pushing well to the fore nortons vibrant
voice rang out

  it was a clean job getting him and a
clean job telling the story of how it hap-
pened but there wasnt over much time
and in the rush-tell me jim galloway
how does it happen that the right boot is on
the left foot

chapter iv

rod norton made no arrest
leaving the card-room abruptly he
signaled to julius struve the
heavy-featured hotel-keeper to follow him
in the morning struve in his official capac-
ity as coroner would demand a verdict
having long been in strong sympathy with
the sheriff he was to be looked to now for a

frank prediction of the inquests result
and very thoughtful about it all he gravely
agreed with norton the coroners jury tak-
ing the evidence offered by jim galloway
kid rickard and antone would bring in a
verdict of justifiable homicide

  later on well get em roddy-mebbe
he said finally but not now if you
pulled the kid it would just be runnin up
the county expense an all for nothin

   the sheriff left him in silence and leading
his horse went the few steps to the hotel
ignacio chavez appearing opportunely
norton gave his animal into the breeds cus-
tody ignacio accustomed to doing odd
jobs for el senor roderico nortone and to
the occasional half-dollars resulting from
such transactions led the big gray away
while the sheriff entered the hotel it had
been a day of hard riding and scanty meals
and he was hungry

  bright and new and conspicuous a little
gold-lettered sign at struves doorway
caught his eye and caused him to remember
the wounded left hand which had been pain-
ing him considerably through the long hot
day the sign bore the name of dr v d
page with the words physician and sur-
geon in blue pencilled letters upon the
practitioners card affixed to the brass chain
suspending the sign were the further
words-

room  struves hotel

  the sheriff went through the empty
dining-room where he left his rifle standing
in a comer washed his face and hands in a
basin on the back porch removing the
handkerchief from his left hand and look-
ing in upon the indian cook to say that he
would be ready to eat in five minutes went
to room  it was at the front of -the
building upon the ground floor and opened
almost immediately when he rapped con-
fronting him her own hands just being
dried upon a small linen towel was the girl
he had encountered at the arroyo he
lifted his hat to her looked beyond her
and said simply

  i was looking for dr page is he in
now

  yes she told him gravely come in

please

   he stepped across the threshold his eyes
trained to quick observation of details tak-
ing in all there was to be seen at a glance
the room showed all signs of a fresh un-
the bells of san juan



packing the one table and two chairs piled
high with odds and ends for the most
part the miscellany consisted of big
fat books bundles of towels and fresh
white napkins stoppered bottles of vari-
colored contents and black leather cases no
doubt containing a surgeons instruments
through an open door giving entrance to
the adjoining room he noted further signs of
unpacking with a marked difference in the
character of the litter the girl stepped
quickly to this door shutting out the vision
of a helter-skelter of feminine apparel

  it is your hand she asked as in most
thoroughly matter-of-fact fashion she put
out her own for it let me see it

  but for a moment he bestowed upon her
merely a slow look of question

  you dont mean that you are dr
page he asked then believing that he
understood- youre the nurse

   is a physicians life likely to be so filled
with his duties that he must bring a nurse
with him to san juan she countered
yes i am dr page

  he noted that she was as defiant about the
matter as the kid had been about the killing
of bisbee of las palmas plainly she had
foreseen that the type of man animal in-
habiting this corner of the out-of-the-way
world would be likely to wonder at her
hardihood and perhaps to jeer

  i just got here today she explained
in the same matter-of-fact way conse-
quently you will pardon the looks of things
but i am one of the kind that believes in
hanging out a shingle first getting details
arranged next now may i see the hand
its hardly anything he lifted it now
holding it out in front of him just a
little cut you know but its showing

signs of infection a little antiseptic-

  she had already taken his fingers into
hers was bending over the wound he
noted two things now what strong hands
she had shapely with sensitive fingers all
ignorant of rings how richly alive and
warmly colored her hair was full of little
waves and curls

  she had nothing to say while she treated
him over an alcohol lamp she heated
some water in a bowl brought from the ad-
joining room she cleansed the hand thor-
oughly then the application of the final
antiseptic a bit of absorbent cotton a
winding of surgeons tape about a bit of
gauze and the thing was done only at the

end did she say-

its a peculiar cut-not a knife-cut is

it

no he answered humorously did it
on a piece of lead  how much is it doctor

  two dollars she told him again busied
with the drying of her own hands better
let me look at it again in the morning if it
pains you any

  he laid two silver dollars in her palm
hesitated a moment and then went out

  shes got the nerve was his thoughtful
estimate as he went to his corner table in
the dining-room ftut i dont believe she
is going to last long in san juan funny
she should come to a place like this anyhow
wonder what the v stands for

  at any rate the hand had been skilfully
treated and bandaged he nodded at it
approvingly then with his meal set be-
fore him he divided his thoughts pretty
evenly between it and the recent shooting at
the casa blanca the sense was strong
upon him as it had been many a time before
that before very long either rod norton or
jim galloway would lie as the sheepman
from las palmas was lying while the other
might watch his sunrises and sunsets with
a strange new emotion of security

  the sheriff manifesting an appetite
which gave color to the suspicion that he
had not eaten for a matter of twelve hours
was beginning his meal when the newest
stranger in san juan came into the dining-
room she had had time to finish bathing
her hands and face had arranged her lus-
trous copper-brown hair becomingly and
looked fresh and cool and pretty norton
approved of her with his keen eyes while he
watched her go to her place at a table
across the room as she sat down giving
no sign of having noted him her back to-
ward him he continued to observe and to
admire her lithe perfect figure and the
strong sensitive hands busied with her
napkin

  a slovenly half-grown indian girl anita
the cooks daughter came in from the
kitchen directed the slumbrous eyes of her
race upon the sheriff who fitted well in a
womans eye and went to serve the single
other late diner now norton caught a
fleeting view of v d pages throat and
cheek as she turned slightly in speaking
with anita the serving-maid withdrew
and as she went out norton rose to his feet
and crossed the room to the far table


adventure

  may i bring my things over and eat
with you he asked when he stood looking
down on her and she had lifted her eyes curi-
ously to his if youve come to stay you
cant go on forever not knowing anybody
here you know since youve got to know
us sooner or later why not begin to get ac-
quainted here and now and with me
im roderick norton

  one must have had far less discernment
than she not to have felt instinctively that
the great bulk of human conventions would
shrivel and vanish before they could cross
this far across the desert lands besides
the man standing over her looked straight
and honestly into her eyes and for a little
she glimpsed again the youth of him veiled
by the sternness his life had set into his soul
and upon his face

  it is kind of you to have pity upon me in
my isolation she answered lightly and
without hesitation and to tell the truth
i never was so terribly lonesome in all my
life

  he made two trips back and forth to bring
his plate and coffee cup and auxiliary sauce
dishes and plated silver while she wondered
idly that he did not instruct the indian girl
to perform the service for him even then
she half-formulated the thought that it was
a much more natural thing for this man to
do for himself what he wanted done than
for him to sit down to be waited upon
a small matter no doubt but then moun-
tains are made up of small particles and
character of just such small characteristics
as this

during the half-hour which
they spent together over their meal
they got to know each other rather
better than chance acquaintances are likely
to do in so brief a time for from the mo-
ment of nortons coming over to her table
the bars were fortuitously down between
them she was plainly eager to supplement
ignacio chavezs information of la genie of
san juan and its surrounding country
evincing a curiosity which he readily under-
stood to be based upon the necessities of her
profession

  in return for all that he told her she
sketchily spoke of her own plans very
vague plans to be sure she admitted with
one of her quick gay smiles she had come
prepared to accept what she found she was
playing no game of hide and seek with her

destiny but had come out thus far from the
former limits of her existence to meet life
half-way hoping to do good for others a
little imperiously determined to achieve
her own measure of success and happiness

  from the beginning each was ready per-
haps more than ready to like the other
her eyes whether they smiled or grew sud-
denly grave pleased him always were they
fearless he sensed that beneath the exter-
nal soft beauty of a very lovely young
woman there was a spirit of hardihood in
every sense worthy of the success which she
had come out bare-handed to make for
herself and in the estimation of rod
norton no quality stood higher than a
superb independence

  on her part there was first a definite
surprise then a glow of satisfaction that in
this virile arm of the law there was nothing
of the blusterer she set him down as a
quiet gentleman first as a sheriff next
she enjoyed his low good-humored laugh
and laughed back with him even while she
experienced again the unaccustomed thrill
at the sheer physical bigness of him the
essentially masculine strength of a hardy
son of the southwestern outdoors

   not once had he referred to the affair at
the casa blanca or to his part in it not a
question did she ask him concerning it
he told himself that so utterly human so
perfectly feminine a being as she must be
burning with curiosity she marvelled that
he could think speak of anything else
when they rose together from the table
they were alike prepared should circum-
stance so direct to be friends

  she was going now to call upon the
engles she had told him that she had a
letter to mrs engle from a common friend
in richmond

  i dont want to appear to be riding too
hard on your trail he smiled at her
but i was planning dropping in on the
engles myself this evening theyre
friends of mine you know

  she laughed and as they left the hotel
propounded a riddle for him to answer
should mr norton introduce her to mrs
engle so that she might present her letter
or after the letter was presented should
mrs engle introduce her to mr norton

   it did not suggest itself to her until they
had passed from the street through the
cottonwoods and into the splendid living-
room of the engle home that her escort was
the bells of san juan



not dressed as she had imagined all civilized
mankind dressed for a call walking
through the primitive town his boots and
soft shirt and travel-soiled hat had been in
too perfect keeping with the environment
for her to be more than pleasurably con-
scious of them at the engles however
his garb struck her for a moment of the first
shock of contrast as almost grotesquely out
of place

  at the broad front door norton had
rapped the desultory striking of a pianos
keys ceased abruptly a girls voice crying
eagerly its roddy hinted at the iden-
tity of the listless player a door within
flung open flooded the broad entrance hall
with light and then the outer door
framed banker engles daughter fair-
haired fair-skinned fluffy-skirted her eyes
bright with unhidden expectation her two
hands held out offering themselves in dou-
bled greetings but having seen the unex-
pected guest at the sheriffs side the bright-
haired girl paused for a brief moment of
uncertainty upon the threshold her hands
falling to her sides

  hello florrie norton was saying
quietly i have brought a caller for your
mother miss engle miss page

  how do you do miss page florrie
replied regaining her poise and giving one of
her hands to each of the callers the abandon
of her first appearance gone in a flash to be
replaced by a vague hint of stiffness
mama will be so glad to see you do
come in

  she turned and led the way down the
wide deep hall and into the living-room a
chamber which boldly defied one to remem-
ber that he was still upon the rim of the
desert in one swift glance the newcomer
to san juan was offered a picture in which
the tall carelessly-clad form of the sheriff
became incongruous she wondered that he
remained at his ease as he so obviously
did

  yonder was a grand piano a silver-chased
vase upon a wall bracket over it holding
three long-stemmed red roses a heavy
massive-topped table strewn comfortably
and invitingly with books and magazines
an exquisite rug and one painting upon the
far wall an original seascape suggestive of
waugh at his best excellent leather-
upholstered chairs luxuriously inviting and
at once homelike and rich just rising
from one of these chairs drawn up to the

table reading-lamp a book still in his hand
was mr engle while mrs engle in lavender
as fair as her daughter just beginning to
grow stout came forward smilingly

  back again roddy

  she gave him a plump hand patted his
lean brown fingers after her motherly fash-
ion and came to where the girl had stopped
just within the door

  virginia page arent you as if any
one in the world would have to tell me who
you were you are your mother all over
child did you know it oh kiss me kiss
me my dear for your mothers sake and
save your handshakes for strangers
virginia taken utterly by surprise as
mrs engles arms closed warmly about her
grew rosy with pleasure the dreary loneli-
ness of a long day was wiped out with a
kiss and a hug

  i didnt know- she began haltingly
only to be cut short by mrs engle crying
to her husband

  its virginia page john wouldnt you
have known her anywhere

  john engle courteous urbane a pleas-
ant-featured man with grave kindly eyes
and a rather large firm-lipped mouth nod-
ded to norton and gave virginia his hand
cordially

  i must be satisfied with a handshake
miss page he said in a deep pleasant
voice but i refuse to be a mere stranger
we are immensely glad to have you with us
mother cant you see we have most thor-
oughly mystified her swooping down upon
her like this without giving her an inkling
of how and why we expected her

  roderick norton and florrie engle had
drawn a little apart virginia with her back
tcthem during the greeting of mrs and mr
engle had no way of knowing whether the
withdrawal had been by mutually sponta-
neous desire or whether the initiative had
been the sheriffs or miss engles not that
it mattered or concerned her in any
slightest particular   

  in her hand was the note of introduction
she had brought from mrs seth morgan
evidently both its services and those of
roderick norton might be dispensed with
in the matter of her being presented

  of course mrs engle was saying
an arm about the girls slim waist she drew
her to a big leather couch and still holding
her hand sat down beside her marian
never does things by halves my dear you


adventure

know that dont you thats a letter she
gave you for me well she wrote me an-
other so i know all about you and if
you are willing to accept the relationship
with out-of-the-world folks were sort of
cousins

  virginia page flushed vividly she had
known all along that her mother had been a
distant relative of mrs engle but she had
had no desire no thought even of employ-
ing the very faint tie as a sort of insistent
argument for being accepted by the bankers
family she did not care to come here like
the proverbial poor relation

  you are very kind she said quietly her
lips smiling while her eyes were grave
but i dont want you to feel that i have
been building on the fact of kinship i just
wanted to be friends if you liked me not

because you felt it your duty-

  engle who had come dragging his chair
after him to join them laughed amusedly

  answering your question mrs engle
he chuckled id certainly know her for
virginia page when we come to know her
better maybe she will allow us to call her
cousin virginia in the meantime to play
safe i suppose that to us shed better be
just doctor page

  john is as full of nonsense after banking
hours explained mrs engle still affec-
tionately patting virginias hand as he is
crammed with business from nine until four
which makes life with him possible its like
having two husbands makes for variety
and so saves me from flirting with other
men now tell us all about yourself
virginia who had been a little stiff-
muscled until now leaned back among the
cushions unconscious of a half-sigh of con-
tent and of her relaxation during the long
day san juan had sought to frighten to re-
pel her now it was making ample
amends first the companionable society
of rod norton then the simple hearty
welcome here she returned the pressure of
mrs engles soft warm hands in sheer
gratitude

after that they chatted
lightly engle gradually withdraw-
ing from the conversation and
secretly watching the girl keenly studying
her play of expression seeking according
to his habit to make his guarded estimate of
a new factor in his household from vir-
ginias face his eyes went swiftly now and

then to his daughters animated in her
tete-a-tte with the sheriff once when
virginia turned unexpectedly she caught
the hint of a troubled frown in his eyes

   broad double doors in the west wall of the
living-room gave entrance to the patio
the doors were open now to the slowly
freshening night air and from where she sat
virginia page had a glimpse of a charming
court an orange-tree heavy with fruit and
blossom red and yellow roses a sleeping
fountain whose still water reflected star-
shine and the lamp in its niche under a
grape-vine arbor when norton and flor-
ence engle strolled out into the inviting
patio engle breaking his silence leaned
forward and dominated the conversation

   virginia had been doing the major part of
the talking answering questions about mrs
engles girlhood home telling something of
herself now john engle reminding his
wife that their guest must be consumed with
curiosity about her new environment
sought to interest her in this and that in and
about san juan

  there was a killing this afternoon he
admitted quietly no doubt you know of
it and have been shocked by it and perhaps
on account of it have a little misjudged san
juan we are not all cutthroats here by
any manner of means i think i might al-
most say that the rough element is in the
minority we are in a state of transition
like all other frontier settlements the
railroad though it doesnt come closer than
the little tank station where you took thestage
this morning has touched our lives out here

   a railroad brings civilizing influences
but the first thing it does is to bring in a
surging tide of forces contending against
law and order pioneers and he smiled
his slow grave tolerant smile are as often
as not tumultuous-blooded and self-suffi-
cient and prone to kick over the established
traces weve got that class to deal with
now-and that boy rod norton with his
job cut out for him is getting results hes
the biggest man not only in the county but
in this end of the state right now

  further to that he told her something of
the sheriff young norton having re-
turned from college some three years before
to live the only life possible to one of his
blood had become manager of his fathers
ranch in and beyond the san juan moun-
tains at the time billy norton was the
county sheriff and had his hands full ru-
the bells of san juan



mor said that he had promised himself to
get a certain man engle admitted that
that man was jim galloway of the casa
blanca but either galloway or a tool of
galloway or some other man had gotten
billy norton shooting him down in his own
cabin and from the back putting a shotgun
charge of buckshot into his brain

  it had occurred shortly after roderick
nortons return shortly before the expira-
tion of billy nortons term of office rod
norton putting another man in his place on
the ranch had buried his father and then
had asked of the county his election to the
place made empty by his fathers death
though he was young men believed in him
the election returns gave him his place by a
crushing majority

  and he has done good work concluded
engle thoughtfully because of what he
has done because he does not make an ar-
rest until he has his evidence and then
drives hard to a certain conviction he has
come to be called dead-sure norton and has
come to be respected everywhere and feared
more than a little until now it has become
virtually a two-man fight rod norton
against jim galloway

  john interposed mrs engle arent
you giving virginia rather a somber side of
things

  maybe i am he agreed but this
killing of the las palmas man in broad day-
light has become pretty close to filling my
mind whos going to be next his eyes
went swiftly toward the patio taking stock
of the two figures there then he shrugged
went to the table for a cigar and returned
smiling to inform virginia of life on the
desert and in the valleys beyond the moun-
tains of scattering attempts at reclama-
tion and irrigation of how one made towns
of sun-dried mud of where the adobe soil
itself was found drifted over with sand in
the shade of the cottonwoods

  but mrs engles sigh while her husband
spoke of black mud and straw testified that
her thoughts had clung about those events
and possibilities which she herself had
asked him to avoid her eyes wandered to
the tall rudely-garbed figure dimly seen in
the patio virginia recalling jim galloway
as she had seen him on the stage heavy-
bodied narrow-hipped masterful alike in
carriage and the look of the prominent eyes
glanced with mrs engle toward rod
norton

  he was laughing at something passing
between him and florence and for the mo-
ment appeared utterly boyish were it not
for the grim reminder of the forty-five cali-
ber revolver which the nature of his sworn
duties did not allow of his laying aside even
upon a night like this it would have been
easy toforget that he was all that which the
one word sheriff connotes in a land like
that about san juan

  cant get away from it can we engle
having caught the look in the two womens
eyes broke off abruptly in what he was say-
ing and now sat studying his cigar with
frowning eyes man against man and
the whole county knows it one employing
whatever criminals tools slip into his hands
the other fighting fair and in the open
man against man and in a death-grapple
just because they are the men they are with
one backed up by a hang-dog crowd like
kid rickard and antone and the other
playing virtually a lone hand whats the
end going to be

virginia thought of ignacio chavez
he had he been here would have answered
in the end there will be the ringing of
the bells for a man dead you will see
which one quiensabe the bells will ring

chapter v

through the silence of the outer
night as though in truth ignacio
chavez were speaking and in proph-
ecy came billowing the slow beating of the
deep mourning bell mrs engle sighed
engle frowned virginia for her part sat
rigid at once disturbed and oppressed

  how can you stand that terrible bell
she cried softly i should think that it
would drive you mad how long does he
ring it

  once every hour until midnight an-
swered engle his face once more placid as
he withdrew his look from the patio and
transferred it to his cigar and then with
a half-smile there are many san juans
cousin virginia there is in all the wide
world but one san juan of the bells it is
our distinctive mark you would not take
that from us now that you are to become
of san juan you must like the rest of us
take a pride in san juans bells which
you will do soon or late perhaps just as soon
as you come to know something of their
separate and collective histories


adventure

  tell her john suggested mrs engle
again obviously anxious to dispel the more
lugubrious and tragic atmosphere of the
evening with any chance talk which might
offer itself

  let her wait until ignacio can tell her
laughed engle no one else can tell it so
well and certainly no one else has an equal
pride or even an equal right in the matter

  but though he refused to take up the
colorful theme of the biographies of the
captain the dancer lolita and the rest
john engle began to speak lightly upon an
associated topic first asking the girl if she
knew with what ceremony these ancient
bells had been cast when she shook her
head and while the slow throbbing beat
of the captain still insisted through the
nights silences he explained that doubtless
all six of ignacio chavezs bells had taken
form under the calm gaze of high priests of
old spain

  for legend had it that all six were from
their beginnings destined for the new mis-
sions to be scattered broadcast throughout
a new land to ring out the word of god to
heathen ears and bells meant for such
high service were never cast without grave
religious service and sacrifice

  through the darkness of long dead cen-
turies the girls stimulated fancies followed
the mans words she visualized the great
caldrons in which the fusing metals grew
red and an intolerable white saw men and
women draw near proud blue blood on one
hand and the lowly on the other with one
thought saw the maidens and ladies from
the courtyards of the kings palace as they
removed golden bracelets and necklaces
from white arms and throats so that the
red and yellow gold might go with their
prayers into the molten metals enrichen-
ing them while those whose poverty was
great but whose devotion was greater
offered what little silver ornaments they
could carved silver vases golden cups
minted coins and cherished ornaments all
were offered generously devoutly until the
blazing caldrons had mingled the queens
girdle-clasps with a bauble from the beggar
girl

  and in the end smiled engle there
are no bells with the sweet tone of old mis-
sion bells or with their soft eloquence

  while he was talking ignacio chavez had
allowed the dangling rope to slip from his
hands so that the captain rested quiet in

the starshine roderick and florence were
coming in through the wide patio door
norton was just saying that florrie had
promised to play something for him when
the front door knocker announced another
visitor florence made a little disdainful
face as though she guessed who the newest
caller would be engle went to the door

  even virginia page in this land of
strangers knew who the man was for she
had seen enough of him today on the stage
across the wean miles of desert to remem-
ber him and to dislike him he was the
man whom galloway and the stage driver
had called doc the sole representative of
the medical fraternity in san juan until her
coming she disliked him first vaguely and
with purely feminine instinct secondly be-
cause of an air which he never laid aside of
serene consciousness of self-superiority

   he had come into what he was pleased to
look upon as a community of nobodies
people whom he had the right to look on as
his inferiors intellectually and culturally
he was of that type of man-animal that
lends itself to fairly accurate cataloging at
the end of the first five minutes acquaint-
ance the most striking of the physical
attributes about his person as he entered
were his little mustache and neatly-trimmed
beard and the diamond stickpin in his tie
remove these articles and it would have
been difficult to distinguish him from
countless thousands of other inefficient and
opinionated individuals

  virginia noted that both mr and mrs
engle shook hands with him if not very cor-
dially at least with good-humored tolera-
tion that florence treated him to a stiff
little nod that roderick norton from across
the room greeted him coolly

  dr patten engle was saying this
is our cousin virginia page

  dr patten acknowledged the introduc-
tion and sat down turning to ask how
florrie was today virginia smiled sens-
ing a rebuke in his manner today on the
stage she had made it obvious even to him
that if she must speak with a stranger she
would vastly prefer the talk of the stage-
driver to that of dr caleb patten

   when florence replying briefly turned
to the piano patten addressed norton

  what was our good sheriff doing to-
day he asked banteringly as though the
subject he chose were the most apt one
imaginable for jest another man killed
the bells of san juan



in broad daylight and no one to answer for
it why dont you go get em roddy
norton stared at him steadily and finally

said merely-

  when a disease has fastened itself upon
the body of a community it takes time to
work a cure dr patten

  but not much time to let the life out of a
man like the chap from las palmas why
the man who did the shooting couldnt have
done a nicer job if hed been a surgeon
one bullet square through the cartoid
artery-that leads from the heart to the
head he explained as though his listeners
were children athirst for knowledge which
he and none other could impart the

cerebrum penetrated by a second-

  what other technicality and elucidation
might have followed was lost in a thunder-
ous crashing of the piano keys as florence
engle strove to drown the mans utterance
and succeeded so well that for an instant he
sat gaping at her

  i cant stand that man florence said
sharply to norton and though the words
did not travel across the room virginia was
surprised that even so completely armored
an individual as caleb patten could fail to
grasp the girls meaning

  when florence had pounded her way
through a noisy bit of rag-time caleb pat-
ten with one of his hosts cigars lighted
was leaning a little forward in his chair
alert to seize the first opportunity of snatch-
ing a fresh conversation by the throat

  kid rickard admits killing bisbee he
said to norton what are you going to
do about it the first thing i heard when
i got in from a professional call a little while
ago was that rickard was swaggering
around town saying that you wouldnt
gather him in because you were afraid
to

  the sheriffs face remained unmoved
though the others looked curiously to him
and back to patten who was easy and com-
placent and vaguely irritating

  i imagine you havent seen jim gallo-
way since you got in have you norton
returned quietlv

  no said patten why what has
galloway got to do with it

  ask him he says rickard killed bis-
bee in self-defense

  oh said patten and then if gal-
loway says so i guess you are right in letting
the kid go

  and a trifle hastily it seemed to vir-
ginia he switched talk into another chan-
nel telling of the case on which he had been
out today enlarging upon its difficulties
with which it appeared he had been emi-
nently fitted to cope there was an
amused twinkle in john engles eyes as he
listened

  by the way patten the banker ob-
served when there came a pause youve
got a rival in town had you heard

  what do you mean asked the phy-
sician

  when i introduced you just now to our
cousin virginia i should have told you she
is dr page m d

  again patten said oh but this time in
a tone which through its plain implication
put a sudden flash into virginias eyes as
he looked toward her there was a half-sneer
upon his lips which his scanty growth of
beard and mustache failed to hide had he
gone on to say a lady doctor eh and
laughed the case would not have been al-
tered

  it seems so funny for a girl to be a
doctor said florence for the first time
referring in any way to virginia since she
had flown to the door expecting norton
alone even now she did not look toward
her kinswoman

john engle replied speaking
crisply but just what he said
virginia did not know for sud-
denly her whole attention was withdrawn
from the conversation fixed and held by
something moving in the patio first
she had noted a slight change in rod nor-
tons eyes saw them grow keen and watch-
ful noted that they had turned toward the
door opening into the little court where the
fountain was where the wall lamp threw
its rays wanly among the shrubs and
through the grape arbor he had seen
something move out there from where she
sat she could look the way he looked and
mark how a clump of rose bushes had been
disturbed and now were growing motion-
less again in the quiet night

  wondering she looked again to norton
his eyes told nothing now save that they
were keen and watchful whether or not
he knew what it was so guardedly stirring in
the patio whether he like herself had merely
seen the gently agitated leaves of the bushes
she could not even guess she started when


adventure

engle addressed some trifling remark to
her while she evaded the direct answer she
was fully conscious of the sheriffs eyes
steady upon her he no doubt was won-
dering what she had seen

  it was only a moment later that the
sheriff rose and went to mrs engle telling
her briefly that he had had a day of it in
the saddle since dawn wishing her good
night he shook hands with engle nodded
to patten and coming to virginia said
lightly but she thought with an almost
sternly serious look in his eyes

  were all hoping you like san juan
miss page and you will too if the desert
stillness doesnt get on your nerves but
then silence isnt such a bad thing after all
is it good night

  she understood his meaning and though a
thrill of excitement ran through her blood
answered laughingly

  shall a woman learn from the desert
have i been such a chatter-box mrs
engle that i am to be admonished at the
beginning to learn to hold my tongue
florence looked at her curiously turned
toward norton and then went with him to
the door for a moment their voices came
in an indistinguishable murmur down the
hallway then norton was gone and flor-
ence returned slowly to the living-room

  again and again virginia looked out into
the patio never a twig stirred now all
was as quiet as the sleeping fountains as
silent and mystery-filled as the desert itself
had roderick norton seen more than she
did he know who had been out there
was here the beginning of some further
sinister outgrowth of the lawlessness of
kid rickard of the animosity of jim
galloway was she presently to see nor-
ton himself slipping into the patio from the
other side was she again to hear the rattle
of pistol shots

  he had asked that she say nothing she
had unhesitatingly given him her promise
had she so unquestioningly done as he had
requested because he was the sheriff who
represented the law or because he was
roderick norton who stood for fine up-
standing manhood again she felt flor-
ence englee eyes fixed upon her

florence is prepared at the beginning to
dislike me she thought why just
because i walked with him from the hotel
in the heat of an argument with mrs
engle there came an interruption the

bankers wife was insisting that virginia
do the only sensible thing in the world
that she accept a home under the engle
roof occupying the room already made
ready for her virginia warmed by the
cordial invitation while deeply grateful
felt that she had no right to accept she
had come to san juan to make her own way
she had no claim against the hospitality of
her kinswoman certainly no such claim as
was implied now

  besides there was elmer page her
brother was coming to join her tomorrow
or the next day and as soon as it could be
arranged they would take a house all by
themselves or if that proved impossible
would have a suite at the hotel at the
moment when it seemed that a deadlock had
come between mrs engles eagerness to
mother her cousins daughter and vir-
ginias inborn sense of independence the
interruption came

  it arrived in the form of a boy of ten or
twelve a ragged scantily-clothed swarthy
youngster rubbing a great toe against a
bare leg while from the front door he an-
nounced that ignacio chavez was sick
that he had eaten something muy malo
that he had pains and that he prayed that
the doctor cure him

  patten grunted his disgust

  tell him to wait he said briefly and
in explanation to the others theres noth-
ing the matter with him i saw him on the
street just before i came and wasnt he
ringing his bell not fifteen minutes ago
but the boy had not completed his mes-
sage ignacio was sick and did not wish to
die and so had sent him to ask the miss
lady doctor to come to him virginia
rose swiftly

  you see she said to mrs engle
what a nuisance it would be if i lived with
you may i come to see you tomorrow
while she said good night engle got his hat
ill go with you he said but like
patten i dont believe there is much the
matter with chavez maybe he thinks
hell get a free drink of whisky

  you see again laughed virginia from
the doorway what it would be like mrs
engle if every time i had to make a call
and mr engle deemed it necessary to go
with me-id have to split my fees with
him at the very least and i dont believe
that i could afford to do that

  you could give me all that ignacio pays
the bells of san juan



you chuckled engle and never miss
it

  the boy waited for them and when they
came out into the starlight flitted on ahead
of them when they got to the cotton-
woods a man stepped out to meet them
hello said engle its norton

  i sent the boy for miss page said
norton quicky i had to have a word
with her immediately and im glad that
you came engle i want a favor of you
a mighty big favor of miss page

  the boy had passed on through the shad-
ows and now was to be seen on the street

  i guess you know you can count on me
rod said engle showing no surprise at
nortons information

  i want you when you go back to the
house to say that you have learned that
miss page likes horseback-riding then send
a horse for her to the hotel stable so that
if she likes she can have it in the early
morning and say nothing about my hav-
ing sent the boy

  engle did not answer immediately he
and virginia stood trying to see the sheriffs
features through the darkness he had
spoken quietly enough and yet there was an
odd new note in his voice it was easy to
imagine how the muscles about his lean
jaw had tensioned how his eyes were again
the hard eyes of a man who saw his fight
before him

  i can trust you john continued nor-
ton quickly i can trust ignacio chavez
i can trust julius struve and if you want
it in words of one syllable i can not trust
caleb patten

  hm said engle i think youre mis-
taken there my boy

  maybe returned norton but i
cant afford right now to make any mis-
takes further and in the gloom they
saw his shoulders lifted in a shrug i am
trusting miss page because ive got to
which may not sound pretty but which is
the truth

  of course ill do what you ask engle
said is there anything else

  no just to go on with miss page to
see ignacio he will pretend to be doubled
up with pain and will tell his story of the
tinned meat he ate for dinner then you
can see her to the hotel and go back home
sending the horse over right away then
she will ride with me to see a man who is
hurt-or she will not and ill have to take a

chance on patten

who is it demanded engle sharply
its brocky lane returned norton
and again his voice told of rigid muscles

and hard eyes hes hurt bad too john
and if were to do him any good wed better
be about it

  engle said nothing but the slow deep
breath he drew into his lungs could not have
been more eloquent of his emotion had it
been expelled in a curse

  ill slip around the back way to the
hotel said norton ill be ready when
miss page comes in good night john
and silently without awaiting promise or
protest from the girl he was gone into the
deeper shadows of the cottonwoods

chapter vi

ignacio chavez because thus
he could be of service to el sen or
roderico nortone whom he ad-
mired vastly and loved like a brother drew
to the dregs upon his fine latin talent
doubled up and otherwise contorted and
twisted his lithe body until the sweat stood
out upon his forehead his groans would
have done ample justice to the occasion
had he in sober truth been dying

  virginia treated him sparingly to a harm-
less potion she had secured at her room on
the way by put the bottle into the hands of
ignacios withered and anxious old mother
informed the half-dozen indian onlookers
that she had arrived in time and that the
bell-ringer would live and then was impa-
tient to go with engle to struves hotel
here engle left her to return to his home
and to send the saddle-horse he had prom-
ised norton

  you can ride cant you virginia he
had asked her

  yes she assured him

then ill send persis around shes the
prettiest thing in horseflesh you ever saw

and the gamest and virginia-

  he hesitated

  well she asked

  theres not a squarer whiter man in the
world than rod norton he said emphat-
ically now good night and good luck
and be sure to drop in on us tomorrow
she watched him as he went swiftly
down the street then she turned and went
into the hotel down the hall which echoed
to the click of her heels and to her room
o

adventure

she had barely had time to change for her
ride and to glance at her war bag when a
discreet knock sounded at her door going
to the door she found that it was julius
struve instead of norton

  you are to come with me said the
hotel-keeper softly he is waiting with
the horses

  they passed through the dark dining-
room into the pitch-black kitchen and out
at the rear of the house a moment struve
paused listening then touching her
sleeve he hurried away into the night going
toward the black line of cottonwoods the
girl keeping close to his heels

  at the dry arroyo norton was waiting
holding two saddled horses without a
word he gave her his hand saw her mounted
surrendered persis jerking reins into her
gauntleted hands and swung up to the back
of his own horse struve had already
turned back to the hotel in another mo-
ment and still in silence virginia and nor-
ton were riding away from san juan keep-
ing in the shadows of the trees headed
toward the mountains in the north

  and now suddenly virginia found that
she was giving herself over utterly unex-
pectedly to a keen pulsing joy of life she
had surrendered into the sheriffs hands the
little leather case which contained her
emergency bottles and instruments they
had left san juan a couple of hundred yards
behind their horses were galloping her
stirrup struck now and then against nor-
tons boot

  john engle had not been unduly extrava-
gant in praise of the mare persis virginia
sensed rather than saw clearly the perfect
beautiful creature which carried her de-
lighted in the swinging gallop drew into her
soul something of the serene grandeur of a
starlit night on the desert the soft thud
of shod hoofs in yielding soil was music to
her mingled as it was with the creak of
saddle leather the jingle of bridle and spur
chains she wondered if there had ever
been so perfect a night if she had ever
mounted so finely bred a saddle-animal

  far ahead the san juan mountains lifted
their serrated ridge of ebony on all other
sides the flat lands stretched out seeming to
have no end suggesting to the fancy that
they were kin in limitlessness to the clear
expanse of the sky on all hands little
wind-shaped ridges were like crests of long
waves in an ocean which had just now been

stilled brooded over by the desert- silence
and the desert stars

  i suppose said norton at last that
its up to me to explain

  then begin said virginia by telling
me where we are going

  he swung up his arm pointing

  yonder to the mountains well
reach them in about two hours and a half
then in another two hours or so well
come to where brocky is way up on the
flank of mt temple its going to be a
long hard climb and for you at the end

of a tiresome day-

  how about yourself she asked quickly
and he knew that she was smiling at him
through the dark unless youre made of
iron im almost inclined to believe that
after your friend brocky ill have another
patient who is he

  brocky lane i was going to tell you
you saw something stirring in the patio at
engles i had seen it first it was ignacio
who had slipped in under the wide arch
from the gardens at the rear of the house
he had been sent for me by tom cutter
my deputy brocky lane is foreman of a
big cattle-ranch lying just beyond the
mountains he is also working with me and
with cutter although until ive told you
nobody knows it but ourselves and john
engle before the night is out youll
know rather a good deal about what is go-
ing on miss page he added thoughtfully

  more than youd have been willing for
me to know if circumstances hadnt forced
your hand

  yes he admitted coolly to get
anywhere weve had to sit tight on the
game were playing but from the word
cutter brings poor old brocky is pretty
hard hit and i couldnt take any chances
with his life even though it means taking
chances in another direction

  he might have been a shade less frank
and yet she liked him none the less for giving
her the truth bluntly he was but tacitly
admitting that he knew nothing of her and
yet in this case he would prefer to call upon
her than on caleb patten

  no i dont trust patten he continued
the chain of thought being inevitable
not that id call him crooked so much as a
fool for jim galloway to juggle with he
talks too much

  you wish me to say nothing of to-
nights ride
the bells of san juan



  absolutely nothing if you are missed
before we get back struve will explain that
you were called to see old ramorez a half-
breed over yonder toward las estrellas
that is provided we get back too late for it
to appear likely that you are just resting in
your room or getting things shipshape in
your office thats why i am explaining
about brocky

   since you represent the law in san juan
mr norton she told him since further
mr engle endorses all that you are doing i
believe that i can go blindfolded a little
id rather do that than have you forced
against your better judgment to place con-
fidence in a stranger

  thats fair of you he said heartily
but there are certain matters which you
will have to be told brocky lane has been
shot down by one of jim galloways crowd
it was a cowards job done by a man who
would run a hundred miles rather than meet
brocky in the open and now the thing
which we dont want known is that lane
even so much as set foot on mt temple
we dont want it known that he was any-
where but on las cruces rancho that he
was doing anything but giving his time to his
duties as foreman there

  in particular you dont want jim gallo-
way to know

  in particular i dont want jim galloway
to so much as suspect that brocky lane or
tom cutter or myself have any interest in
mt temple he said emphatically

  but if the man who shot him is one of

galloways crowd as you say-

  hell do no talking for a while after
having seen brocky drop he took one chance
and showed half of his cowardly carcass
around a boulder whereupon brocky
weak and sick and dizzy as he was popped a
bullet into him

  she shuddered

  is there nothing but killing of men
among you people she cried sharply
first the sheepman from las palmas
then brocky lane then the man who shot
him-

  brocky didnt kill moraga norton
explained quietly but he dropped him
and then made him throw down his gun and
crawl out of the brush then tom cutter
gathered him in took him across the county
line gave him into the hands of ben roberts
who is sheriff over there and came on to
san juan roberts will simply hold mor-

aga on some trifling charge and see that he
keeps his mouth shut until we are ready for
him to talk

  then brocky lane and tom cutter
were together on mt temple

  near enough for tom to hear the shoot-
ing

  they grew silent again clearly norton
had done what explaining he deemed neces-
sary and was taking her no further into his
confidences she told herself that he was
right that these were not merely his own
personal secrets that as yet he would be un-
wise to trust a stranger furdier than he was
forced to and yet unreasonably or not
she felt a little hurt she had liked him
from the beginning and from the beginning
she felt that in a case such as his she would
have trusted to intuition and have held back
nothing but she asked none of the ques-
tions which none the less insisted upon pre-
senting themselves to her

  what was the thing that had brought
both brocky lane and tom cutter to mt
temple what had they been seeking
there in a wilderness of crag and cliff
why was roderick norton so determined
that jim galloway should not so much as
suspect that these men were watchful in
the mountains what sinister chain of
circumstances had impelled moraga who
norton said was galloways man to shoot
down the cattle foreman and galloway
himself what type of man must he be if all
that she had heard of him were true what
were his ambitions his plans his power

before long norton pointed out
to her looming ever vaster before
them the shadowy form of mt
temple its mass of rock of wind-blown
wind-carved peaks lifted in somber defiance
against the star-filled sky it brooded
darkly over the lower slopes like an incubus
it dominated the other spines and ridges
its gorges filled with shadow and mystery
its precipices making the sense reel dizzily
and somewhere high up there against the
skv alone suffering perhaps dying a man
had waited through the slow hours still
waited for their coming how slowly she
and norton were riding how heartless of
her to have felt the thrill of pleasure which
had possessed her so utterly an hour ago

  or less than an hour for now again
wandering out far across the open lands
came the heavy mourning of the bell


adventure

  how far away can one hear it she
asked surprised that from so far away its
ringing came so clearly

  i dont know how many miles he an-
swered well hear it from the mountain
i should have heard it today long before i
met you by the arroyo had i not been trav-
eling through two big bands of engles
sheep i wonder if your medicine has cured
ignacio

  behind them san juan drawn into the
shadows of night but calling to them in
mellow-toned cadence of sorrow before
them the somber canons and iron flanks of
mt temple and somewhere still several
hours away brocky lane lying helpless and
perhaps hopeless grim by day the earth
hereabouts was inscrutable by night a
mighty primal sphinx lip-locked spirit-
crushing the man and girl riding swiftly
side by side felt in their different ways ac-
cording to their different characters and
previous experience the mute command laid
upon them and for the most part their lips
were hushed

  there came the first slopes the talus of
strewn broken disintegrating rock and
then the first of the cliffs now the sheriff
rode in the fore and virginia kept her frown-
ing eyes always upon his form leading the
way they turned to the left entered the
broad mouth of a ravine found an uneven
trail and were swallowed up by its utter and
impenetrable blackness

  give persis her head norton advised
her shell find her way and follow me

  his voice low-toned as it was stabbed
through the silence startling her coming
unexpectedly out of the void which had
drawn him and his horse gradually from the
reach of her straining eyes she sighed sat
back in her saddle relaxed loosened her reins

  for an hour they climbed almost steadily
winding in and out frequently riding five
hundred or a thousand feet to accomplish a
hundred of the distance toward brocky
lane now high above the bed of the
gorge the darkness had thinned about them
more than once the girl saw the clear-cut
silhouette of man and beast in front of her
or swerving off to right or left

  when after a long time he spoke again he
was waiting for her to come up with him
he had dismounted loosened the cinch of
his saddle and tied his horse to a stunted
twisted tree in a little flat

  we have to go ahead on foot now he

told her as he put out his hand to help her
down and then as they stood side by side
tired much

  no she answered i was just in the
mood to ride which way now

  he took down the tie-rope from her sad-
dle-strings tied persis a dozen paces from
his own horse and saying briefly this
way again went on she kept her place
almost at his heels now and again accepting
the hand he offered as their way grew
steeper underfoot half an hour ago she
knew that they had swerved off to the left
away from the deep gorge into whose mouth
they had ridden so far below now she saw
that they were once more drawing close to
the steep-walled canon its emptiness
black and sinister lay between them and a
group of bare peaks which were lifted like
cathedral spires against the sky

  this would be simple enough in the
daytime norton told her during one of
their brief pauses in the dark its an-
other matter not tired out are you

  no she assured him for the second
time although long ago she would have
gladly thrown herself down to rest were their
errand any less imperative

  weve got some pretty steep climbing
ahead of us yet he went on quietly
youve got to be careful not to slip oh
and he laughed carelessly youd stop be-
fore you got to the bottom but then a drop
of even half a dozen feet is no joke here
if youll pardon me ill make sure for you

  with no further apology or explanation
he slipped the end of a rope about her waist
tying it in a hard knot until now she had
not even known that he had brought a
rope now she wondered just how hazardous
the hidden trail was which they were trav-
eling if it were in truth but the matter of
half a dozen feet which she would fall if she
slipped he made the other end of the
short rope fast about his own body said
ready and again she followed him
closely

  there came little flat spaces then broken
boulders to clamber through and over then
steep rugged climbs when they grasped the
rough rocks with both hands and moved
on with painful slowness it seemed to the
girl that they had been climbing for long
tedious hours since they had slipped out of
their saddles though to him she said noth-
ing locking her lips stubbornly she knew
that at last she was tired very tired that an
abandoned in the ice



end of this laborious ascent must come soon
or she would be forced to stop and he down
and rest

  fifteen minutes said the sheriff and
were there well use the first five minutes
of it for a rest too

  he made her sit down unstoppered a
canteen which like the coil of rope she did
not know he carried and gave her a drink of
water which seemed to her the most wonder-
fully strength-making life-giving draft in
the world then he dropped down at her
side looked at his watch in the light of a
flaring match carefully cupped in his hand
and lighted his pipe

  nearly midnight he told her

  without replying she lay back against the
slope of the mountain closed her eyes and
relaxed breathing deeply she was very
tired now a moment ago her whole body
had been trembling to the long-continued
strain put upon her muscles her chest
expanded deeply to the long indrawn breath
which filled her lungs with the rare air
she felt suddenly a little sleepy dreaming
longingly of the unutterable content one
could find in just going to sleep with the
cliff-scarred mountainside for couch

  she stirred and opened her eyes rod
norton the sheriff of san juan a man who a
few brief hours ago had been unknown to
her his name even strange sat two paces
from her smoking she and this man of
whom she still knew rather less than nothing
were alone in the world just the two of
them lifted into the sky separated by a
dreary stretch of desert land from other
men and women-bound together by a bit
of rope she tried to see his face the pro-
file more guessed than seen appeared to her
fancy as hard and stern as the line of cliff
just beyond him clear-cut against the sky

  somehow-she did not definitely formu-
late the thought she was at the time but
dimly vaguely conscious of it-she was
glad that she had come to san juan and
she was not afraid of the silent man at her
side not sorry that circumstance had given
them this night and its labors

  norton knocked out his pipe together
they got to their feet

  more careful than ever now he cau-
tioned her look out for each step and go
slowly were there in ten minutes
ready

  ready she answered

                to be continued

abandoned in the ice

  by chart pitt

 i heres a blotch tonight on the snow-fields white
 and the frost-locked floe-bergs fret
 gainst the oaken sides where a whale-ship rides
 with her frozen canvas set

 the star-frost sifts where she dreams and drifts
 in the grip of a crystal sea-

 but the buried trails of the bowhead whales
 urge her on through eternity

 theres a scented breeze on the southern seas
 where her sister ships decay

 but she laughs at time in that frozen clime
 where the blinding blizzards play

 the auroras flare in the bitter air
 where the deadly ice-dust swirls-

 waking the fires of lost desires
 in her cordage of crusted pearls

ouis bodin levuka louis
and jim hurley hawkbill
hurley were the two greatest
and most successful rogues in
the south seas

  ostensibly the business of bodin cen-
tered in his levuka snuggery a top-chop
place of entertainment bed and board for
none below the rank of mate or supercargo
how much louis owned no one in
melanesia knew though many guessed
hurley possessed two or three copra plan-
tations two schooners a barkantine and a
launch-and liked to talk about them
bodins pudgy dextrous fingers were in
many pies of which he invariably super-
intended the division both had brains but
where louis preferred finesse hurley was
apt to bluff

 commerce was sluggish in melanesia
since the commencement of the great war
the need of com had entirely eclipsed the
call for copra tortoise shell-from the
hawkbill turtle-was no longer in demand
china was in trouble and the trade in sea-
slugs-bsche-de-mer-languished

  pearls one can always sell pearls in
tahiti-at a price louis had a pro-
prietary interest in certain pearl lagoons
but he was giving these varying proportions
of the seven years necessary rest between
cullings the value of a gray pearl or a
pink any color outside of white doubles
when such gems are matched

  according to bodins philosophy any fool
can make money when times are good
in days like these it took brains to gather
profit he relaxed his purely physical
functions and concentrated his vitality in
his brain-cells his bright eyes dulled
and his eyelids drooped as he lolled in his
bamboo chair on the shady veranda a
native boy swaying a feather kahili to keep
away the flies

  there is a wireless at levuka which is
on the island of oavalu east of viti levu
louis had a radio station of his own with
which he issued his trade mandates and
gleaned the passing news of the air over
on the main island of the fijis on viti levu
is suva capital and head of the resident
british government


pearls of great price



  the mornings report was in louis hand
and in it was the latest from suva it was
in code but louis had deciphered it as
an ally he was in good standing with the
government though sometimes suspected
of sailing overclose to the mark not of
loyalty but of legality

  the french possessions in melanesia
outside of the loyalties and the penal
settlement of new caledonia are negligible
and at levukalouis was the king frog in a
puddle large enough for his activity the
raiding of german colonies by british and
french cruisers was balm to louis alsatian
soul and the present item that such settle-
ments were being held jointly by english
and gallic governments until final dis-
tribution furnished him pleasant food for
meditation

  the kahili waved on automatically the
boy watched the rise and fall of the sash
that bound louis generous stomach a
ribbon of color between the spotless linen
of his trousers and the white silk of his
shirt the masters eyes seemed closed
but the diaphragmatic respiration was too
controlled for slumber tomis soul lusted
for a cool green coconut with a surrepti-
tious slug of gin added thereto but his soul
was in thrall to bodin and he fanned on

  the languid figure came to action with a
smart clap of palms to which a second
loin-clad boy responded promptly

  hari you take um canoe ten men along
of you you go rewa on viti levu-
my word better you walk along plenty
fast go catch kapitani wells you speak
him come along here levuka way plenty
quick in his schooner

  the kanaka vanished and louis relaxed
again he would have sent his fast launch
but the screw had fouled the top of a floating
coco-palm in the darkness and until another
came from suva the craft was out of com-
mission behind lowered lids he visioned
the canoe speeding south and west with the
paddles blading briskly to a chant a sligh t
sweat broke out on his olive features the
sash rose and fell so did the kahili

  tomi suppose you stop along fan me
one lele second my word you plenty sorry
fanchon

  a sleek-coated bull terrier trotted out
from a comer yawning

  fanchon said louis still with closed
eyes you watch along this boy

  tomi looked at the bitch who ran out a



pink tongue over ivory fangs and grinned
back at him surveying him with eyes that
were very like her masters in the back
of his sluggish brain he registered a thought

  too much devil-smart this white fellow
boss along me and the kahili resumed its
regular rhythmic sweep

rewa is on the eastern coast of
viti levu at the mouth of rewa
river fifty miles from levuka
in its higher reaches the idle fleet of mela-
nesian traders lay where the fresh water
would arrest the bottom growth

  hurley sat in the cockpit of his launch
fishing for mullet at the turn of the tide
two fathoms below half a dozen baked
and split breadfruit had been spiked to
the bottom with sharp stakes serving as
ground-bait to the silvery fish

  breadfruit baited his hook and he was
just hauling in his eighth mullet when he
saw the canoe with bodins head boy
steering battle up-stream against the ebb
make for the akua wells schooner
deliver a message that resulted in instant
activity aboard and then their errand
completed he watched the crew paddling
ashore to where a covey of kanakas were
basking in the mottled shade beneath a
clump of pandanus there they would
rest and visit a while before returning

  the akua was the fastest schooner in the
fijis bar one that was hurleys flag-
ship the lehua a gloucester-fisherman
type to maintain speed supremacy bodin
had bought his fast launchthe fleur-de-lys
the launch in which hurley was fishing
was but a small one practically a tender
with eight knots to the fleur-de-lys fifteen
hurley would have purchased a sixteen or
eighteen-knot power-boat had not times
been so dull and deliveries so uncertain

  how much wells was owner of his
schooner how large was bodins interest
hurley only surmised he knew that wells
had been stranded at levuka after the
wrecking of the trading barkantine of
which he was mate and that bodin had
snapped up the smart young yankee
staked him to the akua and given him
certain shares

  but any ripple of activity in these dull
times was worthy of attention bodins
movements invariably meant money in
sight and in these prospective profits hurley
instantly determined to share he ordered


adventure

the kanaka with him in the launch to haul
in the anchor started the engine and
puttered over to the lehua

   billi you take this bottle kini-kini gin
along those fellows all same you hide
him you tell them you make um steal
you give um drink find out from hari
what for he come along see kapitani wells
bimeby you come back here plenty quick

  his crafty boatswain grinned and made
his way ashore hurley shrilled on a
silver whistle and soon his own crew
assembled got into their beached whale-
boat and boarded the lehua hurley turned
to his mate

  brady theres something doing levuka
way i am going in with billi in the launch
soon as the akua clears follow her out
split tacks with her and be off kokua head
at sunset keep inshore so they wont
spot you from levuka

  within fifteen minutes the akuas main-
sail was hoisted the cable up the head-
sheets taut and she swung to the ebb
dropping down toward the mouth of rewa
river hurley watched her foresail mount
as she caught and heeled to the trade and
reached for oavalu and levuka

  ten minutes later billi came aboard with
what news he could gather and hurley took
him in the launch and started in a bee-ie
for the akuas destination his engine giving
him the power of disregarding wind and
current when he made fast at the boat-
landing the schooner was inhauling sheets
for her final inshore tack the lehua was
not in sight sunset was an hour away

  billi said hurley you go along
back of levuka louis place kapitani
wells he come along bimeby talk along
with louis on back lanai i think when
he come ashore i make plenty talk with
him maybe till dark i keep him you hide
along bush in garden listen what louis
speak along of him then you come back
to foo-chings place-tell me everything
savvy

  i savvy plenty that haole white dog
along levuka louis suppose he savvy
me in bush i think he make kai-kai eat

  you rub your self plenty frangipani
flower that dog no can tell now you walk
along

  billi went with the air of a martyr but
he went at sunset the lehua crept out
from the reef behind kokua head and
sneaked offshore in the dusk hurley

drinking gin rickies at foo-chings awaited
the result of billis mission wishing that he
himself could have wormed into the garden
as quietly as the kanaka and billi his body
smeared with the crushed petals of pungent
frangipani crouched in the crotons under
the veranda where louis talked with wells
fanchon was there too drowsily uncon-
scious of any intruder

so said louis you wish to
enlist now that america is one of
the allies it is good i under-
stand that well but listen mon ami it
will be long before you can get back to
the states by that time the war may be
over suppose it is not what then you
enlist-in what you-a first-class sailing
master will you try to make of yourself a
private or become a jackie aboard a cruiser

  i too would serve france old as i am
but brain is better than muscle mon brave
and it is in my mind that we can help the
cause here in the fijis i have a plan
which should bring much money at the
expense of those pigs of germans and
money always wins this money mon
ami we will send to aid our braves at the
front if you will you shall take it pres-
ently and tell them it is a gift from louis
bodin once of alsace now of the fijis a
gift from levuka louis and yourself

  it will do you no harm to be such a
messenger it is in my mind that they will
need good master-mariners perhaps we
will build with this money a little quick
ship with you in command to go hunting
these sharks of u-boats nom de guerre that
would be better than drill for six months
to learn in which end of the gun fits the
bayonet non

  wells curved of nose lantern of jaw
nodded billi yawned in the crotons this
sort of talk was all words and idle

  tell me about it said wells it
sounds good to me

  in melanesia said louis great
britain owns twenty-one thousand square
miles of islands france seven and a half
and germany seventy-eight thousand-
or she did now she owns nothing it is
spoils of war by and by france and en-
gland will divide meanwhile what hap-
pens the german plantations go back
to the bush for lack of men and the pearl
lagoons lie untouched

   all said wells softly pearls
pearls of great price

 

  in the crotons billis ears pricked up like
a dogs-like fanchons who was beginning
to sniff uneasily

  northeast of new mecklenburg in the
german solomons there is an atoll that is
ripe for gathering it has not been touched
for six years and the shell is very rich i
will give you the position later on paper
figures talked to the air find wings and
fanchon is uneasy what is it fanchon
billi was no fool in the few words last
spoken he had gathered the reason of wells
trip to get the pearls from the german
atoll he sensed too that in the hot
evening his own personal odor was master-
ing that of the fragrant blossoms suffi-
ciently for the dog to detect it it was time
to be moving he started to crawl away
on his belly silently as a snake

  but as he sinuously stretched from the
exposed armpit glands the telltale kanaka
scent permeated the breeze to the indig-
nant offense of fanchons quivering nostrils
without waste of growl the dogs lithe body
rippled over the railing of the lanai and
crashed into the crotons from which the
body of billi shot spurred by fear of fangs

  wells arose half drawing his automatic
from its holster but louis laughed

  let fanchon obtain some exercise mon
ami he said  norn dun nom see the
kanaka run

  across the lawn leaping the shrubbery
spread-eagled billi fled like a shadow in
the dusk the gray streak of fanchon at
his heels they vanished in the palms
that bordered the wild bush there was
a shriek a yelp of triumph from fanchon
and presently the bull terrier came trotting
back and laid a fragment of cloth at her
masters feet billi had hurled himself
into a mass of jungle too dense for fanchon
to tackle but she had drawn blood and
obtained a trophy and was content to leave
billi struggling in the tangle

  louis picked up the bit of cloth it was
a strip of yellow muslin nearly new bright
yellow with purple and red circles inter-
twined for pattern he passed it to wells

  that came out of hurleys trade-room
said the latter he has passed out two
hundred fathoms of the stuff no one else
has it

  it does not surprise me said louis
he came ashore in his launch half an hour
ahead of the akua

  and kept me chinning on the beach

about the war till it was nearly dark
said wells i left him at ching-foos on
the way up

  one of his boys will steer standing for a
while said louis let us go inside it
is warmer but more private

  this is the news i got from suva said
louis presently the solomons are in
charge of the dual governments of france
and england the british resident will
assume charge from bougainville the
french gunboat leopard will proceed from
new caledonia and inform the natives
it is doubtful if she will touch at our atoll
she must not hear your little plan also
hurley must not dip his fingers in this bowl
of poi he will try-which makes the game
more interesting than solitaire

  louis chuckled

  you will provision tonight and go out
on the ebb an hour before dawn do not
wait to rot the pearls the smell might
prove traitor down the wind better to
lose a few you will find the best shell
at the north end of the lagoon come to
see me as soon as the tide turns i shall
be awake i fancy hurley may pay me a
little visit and perhaps he will show some
of his cards he is a little fond of telling
what he holds here is the position eh
bien mon ami au revoir

  as wells left him the dapper little
frenchman half pirate half patriot bent
to scratch fanchon behind the ears

  so you did not eat him dog of my heart
kanaka kai-kai is not to your liking but
you nipped him eh nipped him in the
breech for that you get a better piece of
meat fanchon

rl at nine oclock a sulky and sub-
i dued billi arrived at ching-foos
 itwii with a furrowed flank and received
first aid in the smart of carbolic acid fol-
lowed by peroxide with an emollient in the
shape of a bottle of square-face hurley
was more than complaccnt at the news of
the pearl atoll and took to the beach with
a shirt-pocket full of cigars to work out the
problem as he walked

  he and bodin reasoned much alike
both tried to look at situations first through
the eyes of the other then their own playing
the game several moves ahead and figuring
all contingencies they could conceive

  if louis launch was in commission
hurley was undone his schooner could


adventure

not follow but he could trail the akua
the joker in the pack was the position of
the island he had a plan for getting that
but it meant taking ching-foo into part
confidence and partnership at the worst
he could warn the french cruiser through
the british government at suva that
would net him nothing save the dis-
comfiture of louis and he was playing for
stakes-not just for the game one thing
however he resolved if he could not get
in on the pearls louis should not

  the news that bodin had pirated from the
aerograms had by this time reached ching-
foo hurley gave tribute to louis for the
inspiration of the idea he himself could
not especially share louis patriotic fervor
in spoiling the egyptians by using german
pearls to fight them with the proceeds of
sale to hurley in south sea ethics of
mine and thine the pearls were legitimate
trove for the first finder his financial
horizon was largely bounded by the rim of
the dollar

  as the butt of his second cigar hissed into
the surf-line he resolved upon his first move
he would go and see bodin louis had
been right when he told wells that hurley
liked to assist his bluffs by hinting at the
cards he held louis knew that billi or
one of hurleys boys had been listening
hurley valued rightly the episode of fanchon
and the missing square from billis loin-cloth

  louis would know that hurley knew
the main factor of his scheme louis would
know that in the lehua with the moon in
her third quarter and rising early hurley
could follow the akua wherever she went
night or day with these aces already
in his hand he might persuade louis to
split the pot

  a random thought of trying to take the
pearls by force from wells after the latter
had harvested them and was on the way
home hurley dismissed he had run up
against wells before and the new en-
glander was not to be bluffed if it came
to a fight for the possession of what the
government would consider illegal treasure
wells would give as good as he received

  hurley lit a third cigar and wandered
to the snuggery

  louis received him affably

  heres to better times pledged hurley

  of a truth replied louis present
times are dull eh mon brave

  wells spent no time shuffling the deck

in his walk to the snuggery he had learned
that the akua was provisioning his own
schooner was fairly well stocked lacking
only water and that he had ordered
supplied if he had to chase wells the
latter would soon see the hopelessness of
trying to get away and louis might tire of
the delay

  he looked into the frenchmans smiling
eyes and read that louis had also gone over
the situation between men of their caliber
sparring was a waste of time

  few good things going now louis
said hurley when one breaks we should
all be willing to share it

why mon ami returned louis evenly
square thing to do besides what is
the use of blocking one another partners
dont trump aces unless they are fools
of a truth even fanchon knows that
eh my cabbage the dog sleeps she
has been running and is tired have you a
proposition to make to me mon ami
incidentally his hand strayed to where a
piece of cloth lay on the table beneath a
cigar box hurley grinned at the gesture

  sure have i louis youre on to a
good thing right now let me in on it
or you will block my hand

  id rather be partners louis

  but this enterprise is not my own
the proceeds are not to go to me

  hurley laughed

i suppose not going to give them to
charity the widows and orphans fund
bodin regarded him silently for a second
or two his eyes brightened and dimmed

  the widows and orphans mon dieu
hurlee that is not a bad idea i thank
you i had not thought of that an
excellent idea truly but in any event
i can not share this with you

  hurley flicked the ash from his cigar
and his eyes got steely

  you will share it louis or ill copper
it im on to the scheme piracy thats
what it practically amounts to not that

i give a whoop about that-

  providing you share the loot mon ami
  exactly as i say im on to it

 and you want-

  half ill do the work you can dish

wells you own him half-or-

  or what monsieur

  or nothing either let me in on it or
ill let myself in you know me bodin
im no slack-brained copra-cadger youre
pearls of great price



clever but im no fool and theres no
time to lose what do you say

  not one pearl hurlee not one little
tiny baroque

  you think youve got an ace in the hole
because you know the location but i
know what you are after and youll have

a-of a time shaking me off

  i know what you are drawing to mon
ami you say i have an ace in the hole
i may have two i am playing a good hand
hurlee

  therell be a show-down for the pot
hurley rose choleric but mastering his
chagrin at the twinkle in bodins eyes

  fanchon got up and sniffed gingerly
at his heels to the door standing to watch
him before she went back to her master

  that settles it said hurley to himself
widows and orphans he exploded aloud
does that frenchy think i am a fool
share with him not much either i
rake it all in or he loses

  in the snuggery louis sipped at his
vermouth his eyes had dimmed again
and he saw the ravaged villages of france
the weeping women and the wondering
frightened children

  pour les veuves et les orphelins fanchon
he murmured par le bon dieu cest une
bonne idee

an hour before midnight hur-
ley in his launch chugged out to
where the lehua awaited him and
the schooner passed over the rim of the
horizon and patrolled on long tacks until
the dawn showed the akua leaving levuka
behind her off for the solomons

  at noon wells gave up the attempt to
shake off a swifter opponent and the two
returned as they had sailed for hours on
the same tack like evenly matched cup
racers-only wells had known that hurley
was deliberately sailing a point farther off
the wind than he had to when they were
close-hauled and had as deliberately slack-
ened his sheets when they reached with
half a knot of superior speed ever ready to
be let out upon occasion

  never mind mon brave said louis
when wells reported we vjll lead him
on the chase of the wild goose for a day or
two my propeller arrives from suva on
the manu thursday then we shall see
whats the matter with hurley getting
on to that too said wells he knows

all about the accident and where you are
getting the new screw hell see it when
it comes hell play some trick tip the
tiling off to the government likely

  if he does that said louis we will
have to make a race of it with the leopard
she can not make better than ten knots
you will have to stop at the hebrides at
malaita and maybe at choiseul to get fresh
gasoline for her tank and carry extra drums
see always you have plenty of gasoline
wells if we use the fleur-de-lys i have
no fancy to see her smashed by a shell
or you on new caledonia but i do not
think hurlee will inform-not until le
dernier resort we shall see what we shall
see in the meantime mon ami let us
prepare for emergencies i have something
to show you also you can rot out the
shell

  when wells arrived aboard his schooner
he wore a broad smile

  tim he said to his supercargo
bodins the father of all the foxes

  tim donnelly grinned

  hes a whole kennel of foxes tis
myself could have told you that he said
levuka louis was born with a wishbone
in his mouth an he chewed the nipples of
his milk bottles to rags with his wisdom
teeth whin he was yet a babe in ar-r-ms
dont be tellinme anything about bodin

  twice more the akua put to sea and
twice more the lehua trailed her out and
back then the inter-island steamer manu
came and brought a new propeller for bodin
to the knowledge of all levuka and
hurley took counsel with ching-foo

  that evening the akua went to sea once
more and once again the lehua trailed her
hanging to her quarter league after league
like a wolf on the trail of a wounded caribou
but wells was not aboard the half-manned
akua nor hurley on the lehua the first
was closeted with bodin in his snuggery
and the second sneaked aboard the manu
from a shore-boat and took passage to suva

  twenty-four hours later the launch
fleur-de-lys passed through the reef
entrance with a smother of foam at her
sharp bows fifty miles offshore wells
saw the topsails of the two schooners
returning to levuka

  it looks like clear sailing tim he
said

  theres one thing ye should rimimber
answered donnelly louis is a fox but


adventure

hurley bad cess to him is a wolf sure
that engine runs like a watch skipper
what are we making

  a trifle better than seventeen tim
are all the arms aboard

  guns and cartridges-not forgettin
a stick or two of dynnymite for luck

  the boats a beauty said wells half
regretfully its a pity she hasnt got
sticks in her but she makes the time
and time is the essence of this contract

  fgfetej dawn rolled up the sky almost as
swiftly as a spring blind jumps to
the release and floods a room with
ight the pearl atoll lay revealed upon
the sea sapphire to the reef and emerald
within clean cut as an etching the palm-
fronds waving in the morning breeze the
fleur-de-lys lay at anchor in the outer
lagoon there were two of these in hour-
glass shape the unlovely teutonic name
of the atoll was pretzel isle

  a thin thread of smoke wavered in the
wind from a fire on the beach where wells
with donnelly and a crew of twelve men
from the complement of the akua were
preparing to enjoy a farewell breakfast

  a heap of shells proclaimed their indus-
try gems that could not be held in a pint
measure attested the richness of the fishing

  they had been there for ten busy days
already the oyster meat despoiled of
pearls was beginning to rot and taint the
leeward air and so far there had been
no hint of disturbance

  the meal was leisurely finished and the
crew prepared to gather fresh coconuts for
the return trip six of them set strips
of cloth about their middles and hitched
themselves up the slender trunks wells
lit his pipe and donnelly busied himself to
oversee the lading

  unseen unheard unsuspected a launch
painted white with a buff funnel one gilt
letter at the bows the tricolor of france
trailing in the wind of her going glided
round the atoll hidden by the palms and
pandanus scrub until it had fairly entered
the mouth of the outer lagoon a puff of
smoke came from a gun in her bows

  wells jumped to his feet his hand swung
to his hip and fell as he saw the ensign
and the jackets of the french marines who
charged up the beach their bayonets
gleaming an officer ran with them re-
volver in hand lanyarded to his wrist

the kanakas slid down the palms and
gathered open-mouthed donnelly swore

  that dirty wolf of a hurley he said
the informin thief of the world

  wells knocked the ashes from his pipe
and grimly faced the officer

  parlez vous franqais demanded the
latter

  i do not answered wells shortly
then i will spik english this island
is the property of france an great britain
you have poach pearl those pearl i
deman

  diwle a pearl did we get said don-
nelly some one was ahead of us-a chap
named hurley

  hurlee i know not said the officer
but you he regard those shells would
you open so many for nothing bah give
me those pearl an i leave you with warning
i have nqt room for you in my launch an
i must return to my ship refuse-i towyou
all an then- he shrugged his shoulders-
new caledonia is not healthy mon ami
if i give you the pearls said wells
resignedly you will leave us here

  those are my ordaire we know where
from you come messieurs we shall keep the
eye on you now we are ver busy too
busy for prisonnaires perhaps you will
soon fight for france an englan an this
shall be forgotten

  i am an american citizen said wells
i am going to enlist

  me too said donnelly

  bien but now those pearl

  with a wry grimace wells took off his
belt it was lined with chamois leather
pouches designed for gold but now he
emptied from them into the husk of a
coconut a pint of shimmering globules
rounded gleaming with all the tender hues
of dawn the officer poured them into a
leather pouch he produced from his uniform
and stowed them away

  i must observe your gasoline said the
frenchman come to your launch
protestingly wells went with them and
watched them half empty the tank

  this will hardly take me to new
mecklenburg he grumbled and when
i start to get more theyll pinch us

  once more the officer shrugged

  ordaire messieurs you should have
think of that before you play corsair you
have the chance to go where you like
i wish you bon voyage au revoir
pearls of great price



  the marines reentered the trim boat
and the ravished pearl-gatherers watched
her vanish around the atoll

  we should have think of that before
mimicked donnelly you arent as smart
as you think you are frenchy frog-eater
hari you start um boys dig up those drums
of gasoline well not put in at mecklen-
burg this trip whats the idea skipper
we ought to have made that chap give
us a receipt for the pearls tim

  fat chance why

 did you see his eyes he has
handled pearls before i wouldnt wonder
if some of them were missing when he turns
them over

  it wont be makin any diffirince to us
now said tim

  no said wells relighting his pipe
get those nuts aboard and well clear out

it was six weeks later when
hurley came to levuka on the
manu and went up to the snuggery
with the officers of the steamer and the
passengers he was arrayed in linen and
silk and he led the procession

  the drinks are on me louis he said
take the orders presently you may buy
he smiled at his audience who scented a
joke the deft boys served them

  heres to success louis said hurley
  bodin bowed and raised his glass

  if you will pardon me gentlemen i will
drink to la france and to the widows
and orphans he added in an aside to
hurley as the guests rose to the toast
hurley glanced at louis and grinned
are you in the market for pearls
louis he asked

  perhaps have you any i will look
at them presently replied louis

  want to do business in private all
right that suits me but the drinks are
on you louis take my word for it

the glasses were replenished louis rose
i give you messieurs he said the
widows and orphans of our united armies
once more the toast was taken standing
and now hurlee said louis

  he led the way to his private room and
hurley followed with a shoulder grin at
the crowd as louis shut the door hurley
reached into the inner pocket of his coat
disclosing the slung holster of an auto-
matic from a leather pouch he poured
on to a black silk neckerchief a pint of

pearls louis bent gravely over them
  they are very pretty he said

  hurley threw back his head and laughed
louis you are a game sport i am
almost tempted to divvy with you
almost not quite why dont you ask
me where they came from or has wells
got back in the fleur-de-lys

  he has arrived and gone away again
said louis to the states on the
mariposa so you need not tell me where
these came from my friend i have
guessed one thing i do not know how
did you get the position of the atoll
game louis youre a game loser
ill let you cheat me on the price for that
the position wells cook is part pa-ke
chinese i sicked ching-foo on to him
he went through wells clothes when he
was asleep simple enough

  only you have to share with ching-foo
that is too bad

  there is plenty to go around i reckon
what are they worth louis or rather
what will you give me for them

  i overlooked the cook said louis
ignoring the request for the moment you
took that trick mon brave

  i took all of them louis i told you i
held the best hand you should have seen
wells face when they asked him for the
pearls

  you were there

  in the cabin of the launch we fixed
it up for a man-of-war tender renault
from suva was the officer he used to be
an actor once we only just got there on
time louis but we should have cut you
off on the way back

  renault from suva said louis softly
i shall remember that name so the
rrrttrines were not real eh hurley that
was very clever of you

  fakes every one of them said hurley
outside of renault not one of the bunch
knew a word of french how about the
pearls a gleam came into louis eyes

  fakes every one of them mon ami
they cost me sixty dollars a long time ago
made in melbourne hurlee i will give
you sixty dollars for them the real ones
were hidden in the fleur-de-lys i bought
them myself on speculation for twenty
thousand dollars wells has the money
with him to give to widows and orphans
never mind the gun hurlee be a good
loser au revoir et bon voyage

oo v c tuttle 

author of loco or love making good for mulcy etc

 w odestone you flea-bitten
 long-eared ancestor of a jack-
vslmx rabbit take a look at the best
place the lord ever made and
rejoice with me

   lodestone wiggles his ears kicks at a
 hoss-fly narrowly missing my head and
 looks with sad eyes down at the city of
 piperock then he goes to sleep which
 shows that a burro aint got no finer feelings

   we been away for quite a while-me and
 lodestone we pilgrims up the bitter
 root range to where old blue nose sticks
 into the clouds crosses over and pilgrims
 back the other side all of which takes up
 several months and dont net me nothing
 but blisters and blasphemy

   i misses magpie simpkins a heap and
 i welcomes the day when i can shake the
 hand of that long loose-jointed hombre
 magpie is one of the leading citizens of
 piperock and until a few months ago my
 pardner

  when i left to make my fortune he was
setting there in his office-magpie is the
sheriff-and wondering how he can square
things with the populace to get reelected

  hes of the lodge-pole type and wears a
goodly length of hair on his upper lip he
pleads with me not to leave him but for
once in my life i turns a deaf ear to his
siren voice and herds my burro out of
hearing

  piperock aint what a stranger would call
a paradise on earth and she dont qualify
for the milk and honey but shes a mans
town-all up and down the street

  me and lodestone pilgrims through the
dust up to buck mastersons saloon and
i goes inside buck and tellurium are
there and they welcomes me like a lost
brother buck salutes me with the proper
ingredients and we exchanges pleasantries

  after we sort of gets used to each other
again buck hauls out a sheet of paper and
smooths it out on the bar


tied up for tombstone



  take a look at that ike says he
theres something new

  i sizes her up its what resembles a
newspaper-in some respects-but i cant
seem to read it none to speak of the label
across the top resembles this-

tolip kcorepip eht

the rest of the page is smears and blots
looks like a russian proclamation
buck says i where did it come from
right here ike that ex-pardner of
yours published it

  magpie i asks and they both nods
thats his first edition replies buck
he took over the office when a few of the
local boys ran the editor across the border
for slandering the community that paper
invades this here country about a month
after you leaves and she runs high along
until the editor gets a call to uplift the
community yesterday he beat the posse
across the line and magpie gets out his
maiden sheet this - here feller speaks
feelingly of lawlessness and even goes so
far as to make personal remarks about
our morals what he said about the town
of paradise was awful

   is magpie still sheriff i asks
uh-huh admits tellurium who aint
friendly with magpie abe anderson
was running against him and had a grand
chance to win but abes old weakness crops
up and spoils things

  abe seen a chance to run off some circle
star cows explains buck he runs foul
of magpie and three of the circle star
punchers and when they gets through
convincing him that thou shalt not steal
he aint in shape to use votes magpie
races alone and is elected by five votes
well well says i a few months sure
does change the map ill go down and see
if that benighted son of a lodge-pole dont
need some help

  i prods lodestone down the street to
where i sees a sign which proclaims theres a
newspaper office i hitches my rolling stock
and goes inside magpie is there all i
can see is the bottom of his boots the seat of
his pants and his elbows-the rest of him
is behind a newspaper as he leans back in a
chair with his feet on the table

  i leans against the table and rolls a
smoke he glances at me switches his
cigaret over to the other side of his mouth

and goes on trying to read i say trying
to read for the reason that hes got a paper
he printed himself

  pretty soon he yawns and lays the paper
across his knees

   ike says he thats some paper
some ink too if thats anything to brag
about i replies when did you learn
to write russian maybe its chinook
with the blind staggers magpie but any-
way shes a terrible language what does
them big letters at the top proclaim
that huh the piperock pilot
wont the letters run the other way
magpie

  i reckon they would ike but how in

-am i going to know what she reads

its a danged sight easier for the public
to read the print backwards than it is for
me to read the type thataway im glad
to see yuh ike

still follering the line of least resistance
eh magpie im glad to see you too
accumulate anything on your trip ike
wood-ticks fool-hens and a growing
conviction that rich rock is scarce hows
things at the sheriffs office

  tolable ike won by a narrow major-
ity i reckon if abe had a lived wed a
needed a recount lot of folks voted for
him after he was dead

  they would i agrees lot of folks
around here aint got no more ambition
than to vote for a corpse how comes it
youre a editor has all the bad-men died
off or has a moral wave hit piperock

   i always been a critter of circumstance
ike he states unfolding his long legs
and easing his gun handy-like i always
been a disciple of advance and ive worn
all the skin off my shoulder trying to give
the wheels of progress a lift at times them
wheels have slipped and sprained my im-
mediate future but i never peeped

  when this here misguided editor fades
across the horizon me being sheriff appro-
priates this here plant and opines to run it
as a public institution theres twenty-five
sheets of paper left and one can of ink
my first edition takes twelve sheets and
i hereby claims that a man without no
experience what can rise to the occasion
and put out a paper like that is a credit
to the community

  didnt you have trouble finding all
them letters magpie

  trouble say the ends of my fingers


 adventure

are so tender i can hold out my hands
and feel the sun slide behind the hills the
next publication is problematical ike
im short of material but i only figures
on one more issue i got a article set up
and i cant publish until the time is
ripe

  something special

  uh-huh tombstone todds obituary
from wilier crick i asks and magpie
nods

  uh-huh him and cactus collins
comes over here to help elect abe anderson
being as abe was a relative when abe
departs this here vale of tears they up and
proclaims theyre a pair of howling wolves
and that theyre a permanent fixture around
here until such a time as they lays me on
my back and gestures over me with a spade
awful pair of gobblers ike

  why not an obituary for cactus too
magpie

  hes hiding out until such a time as
his stummick is normal ike he horns in
on me yesterday and gets pessimistic to my
face im busy on that obituary and dont
like to be interrupted so i beats him on
the draw accepts his gun as a subscription
and induces him to eat a bucket of paste
awful smelling mess ike id opine that
as far as my future horoscope is concerned
his lips are sealed

  thirteen sheets and one obituary will
be something to print says i has tomb-
stone made any advances

  once i was standing over there by the
window holding up one of them dinguses
what contains type when a bullet comes
along and hits her plumb center she
collapses right there and ruins things
some of that lead type enters my bosom
and for the space of a foot square on my
manly chest i looks like a smallpox patient
this idea of being a man of letters aint no
prosaic pastime ike

just then scenery sims darkens
our doorway scenery is knee-high
to a short injun and his voice
hankers for oil he looks mean-like at
me and magpie and chaws some indus-
trious pretty soon he expectorates copi-
iously on the floor and orates-

  yvant to quit taking the paper
magpie snaps out his gun and covers
scenery

  get down on your knees and wipe out

that-spot snorts magpie what do

yuh think this is-a corral

  i-uh- begins scenery but the gun
dont waver so he takes the handkerchief
off his neck and scrubs our floor

  this is a newspaper-office scenery
states magpie you cant start your
oration with a cloud-burst in here sabe
what you got against the paper and
whyfor dont yuh wish it no more

  i cant read her he squeaks shes
too backward to suit me of course i-
uh-well send her along and ill-uh-do
the best i can i got to go now

  he slips out with his hat in his hand
and lopes off up the street

  thats business ike laughs magpie
im going to make em like it

  when yuh had the drop on him yuh
ought to a collected in advance for another
year says i you sure need a manager
magpie for the piperock pilot limited-
to thirteen sheets and a death notice
howdy gents states a voice at the
door is this the only newspaper in
town

  that person is a novelty in cowland
he stands there exuding perfume and
prosperity from his sunday clothes we
looks him over from his shiny shoes to his
hard hat wonders at his pink cheeks which
match his necktie and both nods

  you answers your own question
stranger states magpie we sure got
a monopoly on all news hereabouts want
to subscribe

  he ambles over and sets down on a stool
and looks the place over he takes off his
hat balances it on his knee and produces
some sheets of paper

  whats your amusement rates he
asks half-page-maybe full

  magpie rolls a fresh smoke and studies
the feller

  well he drawls the person who
operates here ahead of me makes a fixed
price of three dollars for six months but
i dont sabe no case in which he split the
size i dont guarantee to amuse nobody
ill be honest with yuh though this here
paper is on its last legs but ill danged near
guarantee one more issue and if yuh
hankers for it ill put yuh down for one
copy at four-bits

  you misunderstood me he grins i
mean advertising rates im ahead of
uncle toms cabin 
tied up for tombstone



  he puts his hat back on his head and
shuffles them sheets of paper

  we are bringing to your town the great-
est aggregation of stars that ever glowed
over one set of footlights two evas
two topsies three fee-rocious bloodhounds

and eight-

  splangt

  the side window spills its panes over the
place and this persons hat flips off his head
and lands in my lap while a chunk of lead
bores a neat hole in the wall behind the
stranger he freezes right there

  magpie slips his gun across his lap
settles down a little lower in his chair
and lights his cigaret i hands the hat
back to its owner and slides my chair a few
inches further back

  eight what asks magpie
ca-ca-cakes of ice he quavers exam-
ining his hat my- was that a-a-

bullet

  magpie nods and scratches his chin
bullet he wonders again did-
did somebody shoot at me

  nope says magpie at me what
yuh going to do with the ice

  he looks at magpie for a minute and
then gasps-

  at a-a time like this

  he tucks his hat under his arm sneaks
to the door and goes around the corner so
fast his coat simply cracks

  magpie slips his gun loose and spins the
cylinder hitches up his belt and yawns
ike i aint got nothing to prove who it
was but i has the feeling that tombstone
is going too danged far theres such a
thing as personal animosity but when yuh
bust into a mans business and cause him
financial loss its time to start a probe
that show person was about to help us
pay our overhead expenses but now hes
gone gun-shy

  i hereby deputizes you to operate this
here plant while i fulfils the obligations
of my oath concerning public nuisances
you got plenty of ammunition ike

  i aint no editor magpie i objects
i cant even sign my own name so folks
can read it

  sign mine says he youre editor
pro tempore sabe and then he slips
out of the door

  i looks around casual-like places my
 beside me on a chair and sets down out
of line with any window or door its

warm in there and theres a funny smell
about the place i had several scoops of
gall and wormwood in bucks place and
the combination woos sleep in copious gobs
my sombrero slips over my face and i sleep

  sudden-like i wakes and believe me shes
a rude awakening somebody kicks the
chair out from under me and proceeds to
knead my abdomen with their knees toes
fingers thumbs and head when that
part is over they turns me on my face and
rakes me fore and aft with a pair of long-
roweled spurs while they links their hands
in my hair and hammers my forehead 
the floor when i aint got more than a
glimmer of light left in my system they
seems to draw aside and rest

  there i hears a voice state next
time yuh prints your danged newspaper
youll please leave my name out sabe
i aint no shepherd and my shirt is as clean
as yours

   dirty shirt jones youre an assassin
says i weak-like

  he pulls my hat off the bridge of my nose
and takes a look at me

  ike im glad to see yuh back says he
when did yuh get back

mittee

i makes that statement and dirty dont
make no demonstration

hitches up his pants

i sets there and complains bitterly to

date on news wipes the worst of the ink
off my face and goes back to sleep
slim hawkins woke me up slim would


adventure

hes built in the same proportions hes
had a few drinks and is as serious as a owl

  ike says he take a look at my eyes
and see if theyre all right

  little off color but pointing straight
slim whats wrong

  somebody drops a paper at the ranch
today and when i tries to peruse same i
finds that im left-handed and cross-eyed
ive suffered a heap ike and while i hopes
for the best i fears the worst id hate to
go around looking at things backwards
thataway might as well learn to read
chinese wheres the educated party what
operates this here newspaper

  hes- i begins but an apparition
which i deciphers to be dirty shirt comes
in the door

  he seems to have met disaster his hair
has been pawed down over a pair of black
eyes and over his head and under one arm
hangs what is left of a framed map of
montana which adorned magpies office

 he feels painfully in his pockets
  takes out three silver dollars and
lu  l lays em on the table

  dirty shirt jones-three months he
states slow and sad-like

he nods

i know nods dirty shirt keep the
money and send me a copy if magpie can

  dirty squints at me adjusts that frame
to a easier position and rubs his sore eyes

mingled

  dirty weaves out of the door and points
up the street slim looks at them three
dollars and then lays three more beside em

  i dont sabe the game ike but im
matching dirtys ante i dont know what
magpies argument is but anybody what
can make dirty shirt pay three dollars
for a left-handed newspaper must have
something besides conversation

  but dirty shirt was sore says i he
came down to lick the editor

  me too ike i came with malice in

my heart but i goes away plumb meek
dirty shirt licked thunder out of me once
so im three dollars thankful that he met
magpie first have a little drink
thats the first united states ive heard

i cant leave the office alone you go up
and have one and then play editor while
i goes up sabe

  slim comes back in a few minutes and
holds down the place while i pilgrims up
to bucks place me and buck and half-
mile smith leans on the door and discusses
local conditions

out of the bottle and leans against tlie bar

  suffering surcingles he pants ive
sure had one job that ornary hombre
tombstone todd comes into my place a
while ago and climbs into a chair

   young feller says he my hair and
whiskers are too noticeable so i admires
to see em on the floor he hauls out a
six-gun lays it across his lap and leans
back in the chair young feller says he
again a razor what pulls is an abomination
and a barber what uses one is flirting with
the undertaker let your judgment be
your guide 

  was he satisfied asks buck

im here aint i grins ricky but
i wouldnt do it again for a million dollars
and you with a razor in your hand all
this time and his head tilted back
wonders half-mile aloud

  ricky stares at half-mile and considers
the remark

  i seen a colored brother with a razor
once- began half-mile but he happens
to glance towards the door

  we all takes a look

  speak of the devil and- murmurs
buck but the colored person at the door
bursts into profanity that would shame a
professor from a mule college

  why didnt yuh come back ike he
tied up for tombstone



wails sus-somebodv sneaked in hit me
over the head dud-dragged me into the
back room and poured a can of ink all over

  did he speak feelingly of paste asks
magpie

  uh-huh agrees slim drawing figures
on the bar with his inky finger he sort

of choked over the word he-

  hey sam yells a voice at the door
and we observes a stranger in our midst

  its sort of dark inside but he seems to
know what he wants he ambles straight
up to slim and grabs him by the arm

  you slew-footed wobble-jointed son of
a cannibal he yelps wheres them pink
silk underclothes of mine eh

  slim hawkins is slow to anger but when
he does get to going hes hard to stop he
climbs under and over and through this
stranger like he was searching for some-
thing and when he gets through this feller
aint got nothing on but a look of wonder-
ment and one sleeve of his undershirt
slim looks over the pile of clothes on the
floor and shakes his head

  i cant find em he states serious-like
furthermore i dont admire to be called
a son of a cannibal mister man

  the feller braces his hands behind him
on the floor and shakes his head like he was
trying to collect his thoughts he squints
at slim and then explodes

 my- you aint sam

a slight inquiry would have saved us all
this search says slim who is sam
one of my company-my uncle tom
so drawled slim you with this
here uncle toms cabin outfit

  yes says he im simon legree
  so

slim picks the gent up by one leg and
an arm carries him out and dumps him
right into the street without no clothes on

  there yells slim as the stranger hits
the dirt ive read all about yuh mister
legree and this is one colored person yuh
cant run no sandy on sabe

  this legree person dont linger its

about two hundred yards to holts hotel
door and he negotiates the distance in the
time it takes slim to shoot six shots into
the dirt behind him on his way he meets
cobalt williams cobalt steps to one
side to let him past catches his spur in the
dirt and sets down it spoils his aim he
tears the knob off the door after it shuts be-
hind legree cobalt gets up and comes on
down to the saloon shaking his head

  what yuh trying to do-kill him yuh
danged fool snorts slim

  cobalt had reached for the bottle but
he turns to look at slim and his hand drops
he pushes his hat back and stares at slim
and seems to swaller with difficulty

  ex-cuse me he says sort of to himself
no more paradise hooch for mine mike
pelly said it was a hundred and twenty
proof and this proves it first i see a
naked man running around the main street
and then i meets a colored brother what
looks like slim hawkins im through

  he ducks out gets his bronc at the rack
and points out of town

  thats what id call a temperance
lecture in ink opines magpie as editor
and a man of letters i congratulates yuh

who reads may run 

iffsi we inaugurates a poker game
wlj anl plays until almost dark when
 sudden-like we hears the sound of
music and stampedes to the door here
comes that show bunch down the street
and stops in front of the old mint hall
they got a banner what proclaims there

jones is packing the banner with his chest
stuck out like a fool-hen after a feed

  we cashes in and goes over to the band

rack while they comes over to visit us
and violet is no longer a lost dog

   violet is about the size of a he-wolf and
she seems to think she can outrun the string
of tomato cans which are tied to her tail
she goes through under and over that
crowd and what she dont do to us is left
for that pair of broncs and the buckboard
a million dog-fights start right there

  me and legree are close together and
the confusion seems to bring us close to
each other we hits the sidewalk together
and im underneath a couple of rotten
boards break and yours truly disappears

  when i recovers sufficient-like to peek
out its about all over every bronc that
was tied to the rack is gone and part of one
rack is missing most of the crowd is on
the far side of the street but our side is still
well represented two local dogs are still
hauling at each other

  dirty shirt jones head protrudes from
the side of that big drum and his right arm
is wedged straight up making him look
like a drownding man what is going down
for the last time

  mighty jones has got one boot through
the mechanical end of a big brass horn
while from inside the other boot protrudes
that banner with the proclamation missing

  magpie is lying near me with both feet
through wick smiths picket fence and hes
still studying that little note-book

  was that last one lucy or hannibal
he asks slow and deliberate

  it-it dont make no matter says a
weak voice theyre all gone past anyway

and the man who got his hat punctured in
the newspaper office rises up from behind
the fence and tugs at the brim of his hat
which is hanging around his neck

  i goes out and helps to cut dirty shirt
loose from the drum when up comes one of
holts kids

mister says he to the show feller
i seen a man tie them cans on your dogs
give the sheriff a description of him
says he excited-like i offers ten dollars
reward for the conviction of the persons
connected with the dastardly outrage
cheap enough agrees magpie did
he have a long mustache and long hair
naw he didnt have no hair on his
face a-tall replies the kid

  must a been an outside job proclaims
magpie all the men in piperock wear
hair on their faces except slim hawkins
and he wears ink

  me and magpie pilgrims home and uses
up a bottle of hoss liniment

  when yuh going to get that tombstone
person i asks after we finishes our
supper there aint no sense in leaving a
critter like him loose magpie

  hes a ornery hombre all right all
right agrees magpie he aint so dan-
gerous as he is plumb mean ike hes shot
at me several times but as he aint hit me
yet i reckon hes trying to scare me must
a been cactus what painted slim with the
ink me and slim are the same build

  i sure wish that tombstone could live
long enough to read his obituary ike
shes a bird i sure dug deep into my soul
for that stuff and i surprises myself with
what i writes them two is sore over the
election they opined to be deputies
under anderson

  that paper must a printed some truths
about folks i opines and magpie grins
you said something ike he sure did
ride folks yuh ought to see what he said

just about starting to boil over down there
didnt you print yours right soon
magpie i asks seems to me that its a
weekly

  uh-huh-comes out on friday yuh
see i had to change that day right off the
reel cause if i had any hangings to attend
to it would interfere with the paper i
looks into the future ike

  well says i it dont make much
difference now being as the ink is all gone
tied up for tombstone



   thats so i wish youd a stayed there
 and tended to business ike

   and got all hiked up eh i never did
 have any luck and if it had a been me
 somebody would a come in and helped
 cactus find that paste jar too bad the
 show got busted up thataway

   uh-huh yawns magpie we aint
 had a good show for a long time but i dont
 admire a show what depends on three dogs
 and eight cakes of ice lets hit the hay
 that night somebody comes down and
 paints a skull and cross bones on our door
 and it makes magpie sore

   im commencing to get riled internally
 ike he states when he views said works
 of art you go back and hold down the
 newspaper and in a little while ill show
 yuh the scalp of this artist rustle around
 and see if theres any ink left

   i got that obituary all fixed up left-
 handed and shes cached under a soap-box
 behind the printing machine dont jiggle

 it cause shes fragile as- i left that

 page just like she was for the other paper
 but i got a place in it what fits this here
 masterpiece of mine if tombstone should
 make a mistake and hit me yuh wont need
 the obituary sabe

   uh-huh ill just run the rest magpie
 it looks like a bundle o crape anyway
 and ike he reminds me as i buckles
 on my gun yuh take that type stuff and
 put it inside the press sabe then yuh
 take that roller thing and pour on some ink
 roll her over the letters slap on a sheet of
 paper and twist that handle down hard
 you furnish the news magpie says i
 ill hold the wheels of progress for tomb-
 stone todd

 i goes up to bucks place and
 settles some elixir under my belt
 while me and buck talks over the
 humdrum existence were leading

   dirty shirt is still going around with
 his right hand up in the air laughs buck
 reckon hes flagged every one in sight
 hows the show outfit i asks

   right miserable i reckon all of em
 except one left on the stage this morning
 that exception-a colored person-mis-
 takes slim for a blood-brother and being
 as slim aint back yet id say they went
 quite a ways i never seen fast black fade
 the way that person did

   that other colored member didnt have

much to say this morning he was packing
one of them slide horns in the band last
night and when the buckboard hit him
he sails right into pete gonyer him and
pete holds about even until pete gets his
hands loose and then he winds that horn
around the fellers neck so many times
that we has to lay that colored gent across
an anvil and cut it loose with a cold-chisel
seen anything of tombstone todd or
cactus collins i asks but buck says
nope somebody ought to puncture
that pair of jaspers ike i figure theres
only one critter what is meaner than tomb-
stone todd and theres a bounty on his
hide i aint been drunk for six years ike
but when tombstone todd stops enough
lead to make him a spirit im going to
celebrate when does magpie aim to
exterminate said human coyote

  magpie suffers from softening of the
heart says i but him or tombstone is
due to hunt the hereafter right soon

  i leaves there and pilgrims down to the
newspaper office but i dont walk right
inside not me the harper tribe aint
skittish of trouble and my nose aint a
stranger to powder smoke but im cautious

  i injuns up to the back window flattens
my carcass against the wall and peers
inside i aint taking no chances sabe
its a little too early to open up and the
sunshine is nice and warm everything is
peaceful-looking around piperock so i sets
down there on a box against the wall and
communes thusly

  ike harper you sure do live in the best
little town on earth peaceful and quiet-
no hurry or worry plenty of time to live
and no questions asked what if i am a
editor it sure is worth while to live
simply and quietly in a community where
brotherly love is the motto and where
peace doves nest and suckle their young
sudden-like i hears the dull rattle of
many hoofs and down the street comes a
lot of men on hosses they completes a
picture of a peaceful western village
there aint no boisterous or unseemly
language as they ambles along through the
dust-just the jingle of bit-chains and the
squeak of saddles

they dont look like they was going far
cause they dont seem to have no baggage
one of em is carrying a big bucket and
another seems to have a bundle hi his arms
they swings down towards me but i
o

adventure

merely yawns they stops in front of my
office and dismounts i reckon its my
chore to go out and get em to subscribe
but i dont do it i got enough subscrip-
tions they must a thought the only
way to get into a newspaper office was by
main force so they picks up a piece of
lodge-pole and knocks the door down

 comes one shot-no more out of
curiosity more than anything else i sort
of leans forward on my box and takes note
of what i can see out in front the crowd
sort of surrounds somebody what aint got
no clothes on i dont hear much con-
versation what aint profane and pretty
soon i sees some feathers drift away on the
breeze two broncs are linked together
with that pole a bundle what looks like a
mighty buzzard is straddled the pole and
they all moves away as quietly as they came

  i watches em go away and then i yawns
some more and enters the sacred precincts
of the piperock pilot i hunts all over the
place until i finds a can with a little ink
left in it i looks under the soap-box and
finds that obituary after considerable
trouble i deciphers same and this is it

epitaph on tombstone

  he was a bad man from wilier crick

  his bluff was good bul it didnt slick

he shot at the sheriff till the sheriff got sore

now his bools leave tracks on that beautiful shore

  i wipes the tears off my cheeks when i
reads it magpie said he had put his soul
into it but i never knowed before how deep
magpies soul really was its a hy-iu
composition but i got a better idea i
takes it over to where them lead letters
repose and reconstructs the thing a bit

  i aint no poet but in a time like this a
mans spirit guides his fingers i works
for an hour trying to make the blamed
things stand up long enough to be read
backwards and im sore enough to kick
a baby when magpie shows up he looks
at me and grins when he sees what im
doing and rolls a smoke

  one of em has left ike he states
hank padden rode in a while ago and
said he met cactus collins on his way to
wilier crick ill get tombstone before
night sabe

  them is noble resolutions magpie
you know how to make this stuff stand up
while she leaves her message on paper

sure what yuh want to print it for

 ike we aint got no paper to waste
 magpie says i a editor likes to see
 his stuff printed i got a old piece of paper
 what will do for this

 magpie sets the stuff in a little oblong
 affair rolls on some ink lays on the piece
 of paper and twists down the handle this
 is how she looks

tar-on tombstone

he was a bad man from wilier crick

    on his birthday suit grows feathers thick

    feathers and tar instead of a grave

    mistook for an editor cause of a shave

 magpie reads it all through he sets
 down on a box rolls a smoke and reads it
 some more he walks out to the door
 looks around and comes back

 who he asks

 paradise folks magpie

 did you see him in here

 uh-huh he was laying for us
 pshaw

 magpie takes his gun out and looks it
 over sad-like he stares at the door for a
 minute and then-

 whats the notice on the door

 he walks over and looks somebody has
 printed a notice and pinned it on that
 busted door and she reads like this-

   this paper has quit for keeps

 i went back and got that can of ink and
 a stick and i signs it-

tombstone todd

 what for ike asks magpie what
 did he have to do with it

come back here and ill show yuh

 i takes him back to the table and shows
 him a line of lead letters setting there on
 the table its the biggest in sight and
 they reads

epitaf for magpy simpkin brave
men and darn fules dont skare

he was a darn fule may iie
rest in piece

 we walks almost to the door when
 magpie goes back and gets that stick and

chapter xii

the islinois collect

tejince his arrival at the misisepe
-ver had seen no indica-
tions of the presence of savages
the ouisconsin apparently flowed
through an unpeopled wilderness so far
as he had been able to discover the land
lay empty

  his sudden resolution his new deter-
mination to return to virginia and make
good his claim to this beautiful country
for his own people had completely oc-
cupied his mind for the moment the new
zeal burned fiercely and he had-no thought
except the hundreds of leagues he must put
behind him in his new mission

  he half-fell down the very side of the
great bluff catching trees and saplings to
steady himself leaping over boulders
crashing through brush when almost
down he remembered what the three cou-
reurs de bois had told him of a jesuit priest
named jacques marquette who was plan-
ning a journey to the mysterious misisepe as
soon as a representative of the french king

the white indiansetc

should join him at michilimakinac the
thought that they might arrive any day
might return first with news of their dis-
covery spurred him to fresh recklessness
and he dashed out into the open space at the
foot of the bluff so swiftly he was carried to
the waters edge by the impetus of his
descent

  intent only upon the need of speed if he
were to make his return trip to virginia
before fall he wheeled at once toward the
place where he had left his canoe

  then for the first time he became aware
that he was not alone between him and
his craft stood forty or fifty savages all of
whom were regarding him with undisguised
astonishment instantly he recognized
them by their moccasins and weapons to be
islinois and in the same instant he real-
ized that he faced a danger to himself and
its consequent defeat of his new purpose

  quickly he searched the faces of the
indians seeking one which might even re-
semble a victim of pomberts treachery on
the islinois river if he were known or
suspected he knew that there was no hope
that his journey would end even before it


adventure

began and his discovery of the great
water would be valueless

  as dick stood before the group of sav-
ages studying each expressionless face for
some sign of recognition or of hostility his
heart leaped at the thought that the islinois
were a people of scores of villages that men
women and children they numbered more
than a hundred thousand the chances of
these men coming from the distant village
from which he and the three frenchmen had
escaped was slight he was about to walk
forward with his hands stretched out in a
sign of friendliness when the group parted
and a warrior stepped forth and faced his
companions

  immediately he began to speak and so
slowly that dick had no difficulty in under-
standing him

  this is one of the white men of whom we
have heard the savage began for
many years there have come to us stories of
these people with hairy faces who kill
without arrows or clubs who make many
things of iron the outaouas and hurons
have traded with them since i was a child
but only the few of us who have gone north
to the great lake at chequamoigan have
ever seen them

  last summer as you all know four of
these white men came to our country
they had canoes laden with things to trade
and they had much of the strong water that
robs us of our senses they met some of
our people far up our river and after ma-
king them mad with the strong water they
stole all they had some of our people in
the next village were warned and the white
men fled leaving everything behind them

  because of the strong water our people
fought and killed each other they be-
came mad threw each other into the fire
set their homes ablaze were worse than the
beasts none of us here was in that village
but all of us have heard of what happened
there we have all sworn to have revenge
for even the goods that they left in their
flight could not pay for the lives that were
taken from us

  this and he pointed to dick is one
of their race few of them have dared ven-
ture so far from the great water to the east
this man might even be one of them if he
is it is our duty to the islinois to take him
with us to show him to the people of that
village then we can have vengeance if
he is not we will not harm him and we will

give him presents and send him back to his
own people with a warning of the wrath of
the islinois against all those who plunder
and slay as did those four white men on the
big river in our own country

  we have heard that the white men are
fair and generous that they give fine pres-
ents and that their goods are such as we
would like to have we want to be friendly
with the white people but the honor of our
nation will not permit us to submit to rob-
bery and death if good white men come
we will welcome them but we must make
the white men understand now that we are
not to be plundered

  dick saw many nods of approval as the
man evidently a chief finished speaking
and he knew that quick action was neces-
sary if he were to thwart a procedure that
meant certain death for him

  i am pleased to hear so fair a speech
from the men of the islinois he said as he
stepped closer i am glad too that you
have spoken so plainly about the four white
men who plundered a village of your people
it is only just that such men should pay
the penalty

  white men are not all such as those who
have visited you there are people of your
own race who do not always do right and
the same is true of white men for they are
all children of the one father white men
have a justice of their own that is bigger
than the justice of your people if a man
does wrong we do not wait for the people of
his victims to take revenge he is punished
if his crime is known

  i know the four white men who violated
your people last summer

  there was an unconscious forward move-
ment on the part of the savages at this an-
nouncement and their attention was com-
plete

  one of them himself drank of the strong
water enough to loosen his tongue dick
continued and he told of what they had
done did the white men who heard him
tell him he was brave did they give him
presents because of his deed i will tell you
how they answered him

  dick drew his hatchet from his belt and
held it aloft dramatically

  that hand that arm that hatchet he
exclaimed broke the head of the white
man who plundered your people he was
the leader the others were only his tools
as arrows in his hands they ran into the
before marquette



forest and escaped but he who led them
against your people who alone was re-
sponsible for their crime was dead within
seven days after he fled from your coun-
try

  the savages easily swayed by eloquence
lovers of the dramatic were profoundly im-
pressed they began to talk excitedly and
several made friendly advances only the
man who had first spoken remained silent
he stood in front of dick looking steadily
and searchingly into the white mans eyes
his arms were folded across his bare chest
and as the chatter behind him increased his
brows contracted in a frown

   i am glad to hear the words of the white
man he said as he waved his hand for
silence if they are true words none
could sound better if they are not true
our people are unavenged i feel that they
are true but i can not go back to my people
and make them believe what i believe
they must hear the white man themselves
or they will never know if the white
mans words are true he will receive many
presents from my people we will show
him how many and how great we are and he
will come to trade with us and get furs we
will take him with us to our country and
give him presents and let him tell the people
of the plundered village how he has avenged
their wrongs

  an exclamation of approval broke from
the savages and they began to press forward
eagerly

  but protested dick i must hurry
back to my own country if i am to return
before the snow comes with more goods it
is a journey of many moons

  if the white man has spoken the truth
he will have no fear to come among us and
we will pay him richly for his goods said
 the chief with a gesture of finality

dick argued protested but the
more he talked the deeper became
the frown on the chiefs face the
more open his suspicion the virginian
saw his mistake then too he realized
that there was a chance to escape before he
reached the country of the islinois especial-
ly if he agreed to go willingly these sav-
ages knew nothing of the use of canoes and
with his birchbark craft he could outwit or
outdistance them

   i will go with the people of the islinois
he announced i have nothing to fear i

would prefer to go among you with goods
but it shall be as you wish

  the savages proved very friendly but the
chief never abandoned his suspicions and
dick was virtually a prisoner after the
indian custom he pretended to ignore this
acted as if he did not see the precautions
taken to prevent his escape and talked and
joked with the various members of the
party

  the savages were not on the war-path as
he had known when he first saw them but
the reason for their presence so far from
their home was a mystery until nearly a
league farther up the river the men were
joined by their families the women bearing
heavy burdens mostly of wild cattle skins
and robes leggings and various articles
made from the hair of the animal

  dick was not permitted to go alone in his
canoe three men were placed in it with
him among them the chief and when they
reached a point opposite the broad plain on
the east bank the craft was used to trans-
port the entire party across the stream
this required two days for the savages were
not accustomed to the use of the canoe and
the current often carried them far down be-
fore they could make a landing

  once the band was across cabines were
erected and then began for dick the strang-
est scene he had ever witnessed from up
the river came a large brigade of canoes
filled with people of the ayoe nation
they had hardly made themselves at home
before a still larger number of nadouais-
sioux paddled down from the north whole
families crowded into smaller canoes than
dick had ever seen

  mascoutens came down the ouisconsin
from the country near lac mecheygan and
as the weeks slipped by saulteurs from the
lac superior country kickapous jour-
neyed up the misisepe from the lower
reaches of the rocky river and strange
tribes of which dick had never heard drifted
in from the west a month after the ar-
rival of the islinois he estimated that nearly
five thousand savages were encamped on the
plain between the river and the bluffs

  as the number grew dick began to dread
each new arrival of all the people there he
was by far the most conspicuous the most
talked of only a few of the savages had
ever seen a white man and their interest
was unending whenever a shout went up
to signal the approach of a new band either


adventure

by land or water the virginian made him-
self ready

  should ouinibegous venture so far to
join the conglomerate gathering his situ-
ation would be serious should more
islinois come from the village the french-
men had attempted to plunder his fate
would be sealed instantly should more
mascoutens paddle from the upper reaches
of the rock river he might be recognized
and the islinois suspicions confirmed

  but by mid-may the last of the visitors
seemed to have arrived for a week no
new bands came and then dick learned for
the first time the reason for this strange
gathering the nadouaissioux brought out
wild rice and fine dark furs and traded
them for buffalo fat the ayoes depended
entirely upon a large supply of soft red
stone in their bartering and so great was
the desire for this pipe material they reaped
a large reward in copper from the saulteurs
and articles of european manufacture from
the mascoutens

  each tribe came loaded with the products
of its own particular country copper
paintstones mica soapstone jade flint
obsidian and shells were bartered in this
strange mart clam shells from dicks own
atlantic ocean quaintly fringed in bead-
work passed from hand to hand here on
the banks of the great misisepe and rivaled
in popularity the obsidian which the sa-
vages told him came from some great
mountains as far to the westward as the
salt water lay to the east

   for each article in this strange collection
there was a demand ayoes took salt-
water shells with which to make beads in
their homes far to the west the nadouais-
sioux were glad to get obsidian for the manu-
facture of spear and arrow heads and knives
the islinois eagerly exchanged woven hair
goods for copper there was not a nation
that did not have a want nor a nation that
could not fill it

  the ground upon which these distant
peoples gathered was sacred to commerce
even though nations might be at war there
were no hostilities so long as they remained
on the prairie between the hills and the
great river at the mouth of the ouisconsin
distant tribes mingled freely without fear
and without suspicion ayoes with the red
pipestone which could be obtained only in
their country strolled into the cabines of
mascoutens and exchanged it for steel

knives children of the nadouaissioux
romped with those of the islinois kicka-
pou boys shot blackbirds along the river
banks in company with saulteur youngsters

  the mascoutens had several muskets and
the nadouaissioux boasted three or four
weapons captured a year or two before
from the hurons but they lacked powder
for them the ayoes had never seen fire-
arms before nor the islinois and dick made
the most of his musket the islinois as
they saw the respect of the other nations for
their guest became very proud of him al-
ways he was asked to accompany them on
their hunts for deer or the wild cattle and
the pride with which they afterward exhib-
ited his game would have been laughable
to dick had it not been so valuable

  feasts were given continually and in this
because of dicks musket and his skill in
hunting the islinois easily outdid all other
nations their vanity naturally great
seemed about to burst and the members of
the tribe secretly discussed the power their
great nation could wield were they only
equipped with firearms they questioned
dick as to the possibility of getting them
and began to boast among themselves of
their future prowess

  their attitude troubled the virginian for
he had found them a kindly generous
amiable people and he saw in this new arro-
gance and vanity the beginning of one of the
terrible tribal wars but he could not al-
low any interest in them to affect his
chances for freedom and he established him-
self more firmly in their regard by readily
promising the white mans weapons

  everything that dick did or said had be-
hind it the one idea of escape daily he saw
the fruits of his efforts in the added confi-
dence with which the islinois regarded him
only the chief never abated his watchful-
ness it was almost as though he had made
himself responsible to the people of the
plundered village for dicks appearance
always he saw to it that warriors were with
him and at night a man sat at the door of
the cabine in which dick slept

  one thing however gave the virginian
hope the gathering of the strange tribes
would break up in a few days then in
the confusion of departure he would grasp
any opportunity the day the ayoes were
preparing to leave he began to make de-
finite plans

u but the islinois desirous of making one
before marquette



last impression on the assembled nations
had arranged a mammoth feast a band
of young men were sent to hunt deer and
dick could not afford to arouse their sus-
picions by refusing to accompany them as
usual he remained beside a gully while the
savages drove the game toward him in
this way he had killed four deer by noon
and the party moved over to another ravine
beside the runway here they found six
nadouaissioux who were just about to
drive the place for themselves

  the islinois young men insolent with the
pride which had come to the whole band
and confident in dicks musket and their
own superior numbers ordered the na-
douaissioux out the savages from the
north refused and instantly the battle be-
gan dick attempted to prevent the at-
tack to make the islinois see the unreason-
ableness of their demands but his efforts
were unavailing and in less than three
minutes the six nadouaissioux lay dead

  in the exaltation of this achievement the
islinois returned with their game and a
story of how they had punished the insolent
nadouaissioux they were reprimanded
by the chief and cautioned to keep the
affair secret the feast was given that
night and plans for the entire party to leave
the next day were hurriedly made several
nadouaissioux had been invited and the
islinois watched them closely for signs that
the loss of the hunters had become known
but the feast passed off without trouble and
the islinois eager to be off prepared to leave
at dawn

rin the confusion resulting from
the hurried flight dick believed that
at last his chance had come the
chief however detailed two men to guard
him constantly no loophole was offered
and in the morning the entire band heavily
loaded with the results of their bartering
began to cross the river arrangements had
been made with the mascoutens to aid
with their canoes and in a short time the
entire party was on the west bank

  the islinois had kept a close watch on the
nadouaissioux but no signs of hostility or
suspicion were detected the northern
savages had even appeared to take little
heed of the departure of the small band
from the south

  once across the river the islinois pro-
ceeded down its western bank the men

aided with the burdens to make all possible
haste at night a strong guard was thrown
out around their camp and early the second
morning the march was resumed

  after three days all fear of pursuit was
abandoned and they traveled more leisurely
in this reaction dick hoped an opportunity
for his escape might come but the chief
seemed rather to redouble his vigilance
in the manner of the savages he sought to
give the impression that the virginian was
an honored guest one in their care and to be
guarded constantly politely but brazenly
he even insisted upon dick relinquishing
his musket at night saying that the weapon
was too precious to become the loot of a
thieving western indian

  at the end of the fourth day camp was
made in a ravine between two steep bluffs
on the western shore no one feared the
nadouaissioux so far to the south and no
guards were thrown out a couple of sentries
in the camp itself were deemed sufficient

  it was then that the nadouaissioux
struck in the first light of dawn when
sleep was soundest as early as it was pos-
sible to distinguish friend from foe the
northern warriors who all the time had
been ahead of the islinois passing them the
first night in their canoes stole close to the
camp and completely surrounded it taking
every precaution to let no one escape

  so superior were they in numbers and so
sudden and wholly unexpected was their
attack the islinois were powerless those
who did reach their feet and pick up their
weapons were struck down at once fifteen
of the forty men were killed and the others
seeing themselves at the mercy of the foe
surrendered

  the nadouaissioux evidently had planned
to capture dick alive his first knowledge
of the raid was gained from a strong clasp on
his ankles he wakened to find a savage at
each wrist and he lay there without strug-
gling watching the northern indians
spread through the encampment killing all
those who offered resistance

  five minutes after the attack began the
victors were in complete control and dick
shuddered at what was to follow twenty-
five men were prisoners and all the women
and children of thg party there could
only be torture for the first slavery for the
others dicks knowledge of savage war-
fare was extensive and he could conceive of
no alternative


adventure

  the leader of the nadouaissioux ordered
that dick be brought to him he knew
that the white man could speak both lan-
guages and he was asked to interpret to
dicks complete amazement the chief began
as follows

  we learned before the feast given by the
islinois what their young men had done
when our hunters did not return we went
to look for them and found their bodies
and the footprints of the islinois and all
the time we were eating of the meat of the
islinois we were thinking of their treachery
and planning our revenge for our duty
was clear and though we did not wish it
and have had to travel far out of our way
we have come to avenge our dead we did
not intend even now to kill any of the
islinois we have done so only when they
took weapons against us we want only
the ten young men who murdered our
hunters

  dick translated this speech to the pris-
oners they too were mystified by this
leniency but instantly they grasped at the
opportunity to escape the men began at
once to point out those who had taken part
in the attack on the nadouaissioux and as
they did so the northern warriors took them
aside four were among the dead but the
remaining six were closely guarded

  now the nadouaissioux chief said to
dick tell the people of the islinois that
they may go back to their country but that
they are to tell their people that we are a
mighty nation that we desire to live at
peace with our neighbors but that treachery
is never permitted to go unavenged

  dick translated the speech and the islin-
ois as if in a trance prepared for their de-
parture the virginian was equally dazed
by this unheard of toleration on the part of a
band of savages and as he began to see that
it was real sincere not intended as a cloak
to hide another attack he imagined that his
own opportunity had come his canoe
was at the river bank the islinois were
forced to travel by land by night he
would be fifteen or twenty leagues in the
lead and speeding toward virginia

  in his eagerness to be off he turned to get
his musket the chief of the nadouais-
sioux stepped in front of him his hand up-
raised

  the white man will come with our
people ne said

  but i had nothing to do with the killing

of your young men protested the virginian
i am not like the islinois who killed for
the love of the killing

  we know answered the chief sternly
that you were present at the slaughter of
our hunters

  did you see the bodies asked dick
scornfully did you find holes in them
made by the white mans arrows

  we saw the bodies answered the chief
solemnly and we did not find holes made
by the arrows of the white man but we
do not think the white man is a fool and a
hatchet hangs from his belt

   dick drew the little ax from its loop and
handed it to the chief

  can you find blood upon it he de-
manded did you see a mark on your
dead that was not made by the war-clubs of
the islinois

  we only know that the white man was
there was the answer as the chief turned
away to order his warriors to prepare for the
journey to the prairie at the mouth of the
ouisconsin

  dick was frantic in his despair not
once during his captivity among the islinois
had he relinquished the thought of escape
always he had planned on the moment when
the vigilance of the chief would be relaxed
when his attention would be taken by other
matters now when the moment had
arrived there had come this new blow to his
plans it was unthinkable

   as he stood there dazed by this new turn
of affairs it was not fear that he felt but hot
resentment that the decision of one petty
chief of a band of savages should thus de-
feat the success of his great mision should
render impossible the gift that he could
make to his own people

  the nadouaissioux he knew lived far
to the north west of lac superior far be-
yond the limits of the country known to the
coureurs de bois if he were to make his
long journey to virginia before winter he
must start at once to go with this band
to their home in the north meant even
should he escape later that it would be
impossible to reach virginia before the
winter snows

  the knowledge threw dick into a fresh
rage and he ran after the chief to protest
again he argued pleaded threatened the
wrath of the king of france an avenging
army of white men but the nadouais-
sioux only smiled in the end dick was
before marquette



forced into a canoe and the entire party
started up-stream again virginia faded
into the distance

chapter xiii 

the execution

when the nadouaissioux war-party
started northward on the misisepe
the islinois prisoners were forced to do
their share of the paddling the southern
savages were so unskilful their captors
laughed and jeered at their clumsy efforts
dick adept as he was in a canoe escaped
this but he marveled at the ability of the
northerners in handling their little craft
only three or four men could find room in
one but they fairly lifted them from the
water as they shot up-stream

  the mouth of the ouisconsin was reached
on the afternoon of the second day and the
great prairie was found to be deserted by
all except the families of the nadouaissioux
the thousands of savages who had come
for the annual bartering had dispersed to
their homes and the nadouaissioux them-
selves were ready for departure the next
morning

  the desperate position in which dick
found himself drove him to renew his
protests against being carried away with
them although before he began he felt
the futility of his words this time he
did not plead or threaten rather he
argued with all the eloquence at his com-
mand

  he pointed out that the french of
whom they believed him one would surely
hear of this action and that no traders
would dare to venture among them and
carry to them the white mans weapons
for which they were so desirous he felt
that he scored here but although he
watched their faces closely he was unable
to learn anything as to the weight of his
argument they met this as they had all
else that he had said in silence a silence
that was maddening because it told nothing

  his failure even to elicit a reply convinced
the virginian that success must lie in his
ability to slip away to steal a canoe and
paddle down the misisepe the attit-de
of the nadouaissioux encouraged him in
this for while daylight lasted at the
bartering-place there were no guards ap-
pointed to all outward appearances the

prisoners could go and come as they
pleased though none was unwise enough
to wander far from the center of the camp
every woman and child was in reality a
watchful sentry and a hundred warriors
would respond instantly to the first alarm

  with the coming of darkness all oppor-
tunity of escape vanished however dick
and the six other prisoners were placed in a
cabine and a dozen armed warriors took up
their station outside

  the islinois apparently went to sleep
instantly but dick lay awake for a long
time now that he realized that escape
was hopeless for the present he reviewed
the situation more carefully from the
direction in which the misisepe flowed and
from the information he had received from
the savages and antoine goddin he
believed that the ohio of the iroquois
joined the great water not far from the
place where he had left it on his journey
from virginia this convinced him that
the best way back to the colony was to go
down the misisepe until he came to the
ohio then eastward on the route by which
he had come

  if his deductions were correct only three
or four months would be ample for the
journey provided always that he met no
hostile nations and was not made prisoner
again it was now the first of june he
would dare start as late as the first of
august that would give him two months
in which to make good his escape

  the knowledge brought relief from the
first incoherent feeling of the need of
desperate haste now he could plan care-
fully calmly and he told himself success-
fully when the two months were up
or before he resolved that he would be on
his way to virginia to do the thing he had
promised himself that he would do

  with these two months in view he laid
his plans he would appear to submit
to his captivity among the nadouaissioux
this alone would not deceive them and
he must find some method of convincing
the savages that he had no desire to leave
even if he journeyed far north with them
they undoubtedly would remain on or
near the misisepe and down-stream he
could quickly regain the lost ground

  dick was not foolish enough to announce
his submission at once only by his
manner did he appear content to start
northward the next morning he took his


adventure

place in his own canoe paddled as hard as
any of the women and even sang a song
or two as he toiled the nadouaissioux
did not ill-treat their prisoners but that the
deaths of the young men were not being
forgotten was evident in the almost con-
tinuous weeping

  in fact when camp was made weeping
dick believed was the principal occupation
of men women and children culinary
duties were neglected the first night while
the whole band shed tears never before
had dick seen more or greater expressions
of sorrow and his own heart was moved
until he heard one warrior whose eyes were
fairly raining tears relate a humorous story
of the bartering-place

  even the islinois who could speak only
with dick because of the complete dis-
similarity of the languages were struck
by this ability to shed tears at will but
more than anything else the southern
savages spoke of the toleration of their
captors and after the second day of the
northward journey they all began to share
the hope that they might be held as slaves
and adopted into the nation

  the evening of the third day the canoes
reached a second prairie on the east bank
of the river one fully as large as that just
above the mouth of the ouisconsin the
great bluffs continued on either side though
here for the first time a valley stretched
away to the eastward between the hills
and a small river flowed in to join the
misisepe here the party camped for the
night

  the next morning dick found that the
nadouaissioux were not preparing to depart
the weeping habit had been revived and
when he left the cabine in which he had slept
the entire band was shedding tears the
kindly attitude of the savages had van-
ished too and as dick started to walk
away one of the guards thrust him back
through the door a few minutes later all
seven prisoners were marched forth and
surrounded by the guards and followed by
the entire band led to a grove of trees near
the river bank there the chief made a
speech which he asked dick to translate
to the islinois

  six of our hunters were slain by the
people of the islinois and the white man
who was with them he began our
young men were hunting the deer with no
thought of war or murder our people

went to the baxtering-place with no evil
thoughts for any other people vve kept
the truce which has existed on the prairie
at the rivers ouisconsin and misisepe ever
since our oldest men can remember never
have we mblested our deadliest foes while
gathered there

  the young men of the islinois forgot
their duty their reverence for the spirits
that guard the place without cause they
slew our young men

  there have come to us stories of how
the people living far to the east near the
stinking water take prisoners and tie them
to stakes how they burn and slash them
cut off their noses and ears hold hot stones
to their breasts gouge out their eyes thrust
splinters of pine into their flesh and set
them afire we have heard that they tie
them to stakes in the ground and roast off
their feet and legs that they tear out their
finger-nails that they butcher them as
they never would butcher the wild cattle
or the deer or the moose

  all these ways are strange to our people
we find no pleasure in them we live
peaceably among ourselves and our neigh-
bors but we are not a timid race

  he waited for dick to tell the islinois
what he had said and then continued

  in a war we are not afraid to fight as
our enemies have learned but once we
have won we are generous we like to
show that though we are victors we bear
no ill-will toward the vanquished it is
even the custom of our people when we are
at war with another nation and take pris-
oners to send them back to their own
people

he paused and nodded toward
dick who repeated his words to
the other prisoners the vir-
ginian spoke as fully as the chief even added
a few words because of his own dawning
hope that after all they were to be released
the temperate words and even tone of the
chief were inexplicable in the light of what
dick knew of savage revenge and savage
torture

  but antoine goddin had told him that
the sioux were unlike any other savage
nation their leniency toward the band
of islinois their treatment of prisoners
and now the magnanimous tone of the
chief all confirmed this report and in the
face of it all dick could only conclude that
before marquette



they neither wished nor intended to detain
him longer

  when he had translated the chief con-
tinued

  we are now three days journey from
the prairie where all the nations barter
each year we are approaching our own
country even now are on its borders
we have with us the six islinois and the
white man who killed our young men
they killed them not in war but with evil
minds and for an evil purpose under
such conditions it is our duty as well as our
desire that they die we do not wish that
they die as do the prisoners of the nations
to the east we are brave enough without 
eating their hearts and drinking their blood
to add to our own courage but they must
die as is the custom of our people

   dick his face pale his eyes staring was
too stunned by this announcement to turn
away from the chief the instant before
he had seen liberty a quick departure
now he stood face to face with death

  is the white man afraid to die for the
deaths he caused asked the chief scorn-
fully is his heart as white as his skin

  dicks fear was not so much for himself
though he was young and death could never
come easily but his soul rebelled at this
blasting of his hopes at a fate which hinged
so great an enterprise upon so inconse-
quential a thing

  partly in english partly in nadouais-
sioux he protested his innocence stormed
against the injustice of their action threat-
ened with the direst consequences his
imagination could arouse

  but even as he raved and swore in the
face of the chief and the leading men of the
band who were gathered before him he read
the uselessness of his words

  the white man talks in vain inter-
rupted the chief sharply

  as dick inarticulate with working lips
and dazed brain stood staring at the
savages the death scene of antoine goddin
came to him as if it were a vision as if a
spirit had suddenly appeared to rebuke him
he saw the bank of the ouisconsin where
his friend had died saw him lying there
at the foot of the great oak his face calm
his eyes brave to the end

  the frenchmans words returned with all
their simple courage antoine had played
a dangerous game in a far land he had
weighed his chances taken his risks that

the great object might be obtained he
had died like a man dies when he knows
that the balance has swung the other way
and the lips that had finally closed were
curseless

  dick recoiled before a comparison of the
frenchmans words and actions and his
own if he too must relinquish his work
to those who would follow at least he could
do it with the same quiet courage he
turned suddenly to the waiting islinois
head up eyes bright and steady his voice
clear and unfaltering he repeated the last
words of the chiefs message and then faced
the nadouaissioux to await the end

  immediately one of the islinois was led
away from the others and tied to a tree
before him all the boys of the village lined
up their bows drawn arrows in place
no sooner had the guards stepped back
than the flint-tipped shafts were drawn
there was a twanging of tjow strings the
next moment a hail of arrows struck the
prisoner

  like a human porcupine he stood there
arrows impaled in every part of his chest
abdomen and arms but he still lived for
the boys arms had not been strong enough
almost instantly however other arrows
had been fitted to the bows and a second
flight clattered among the shafts already
imbedded the body of the prisoner sagged
in its bonds and his head fell forward sev-
eral warriors ran up and cut the dead man
loose the body was thrown into the river

  a second islinois was bound to the tree and
he too lived until the second flight of arrows

  the third walked up proudly and was
rewarded by a bit of flint entering his eye
and piercing his brain bringing instant
death the boy who had fired the arrow
ran forward and drew it out with a shrill
cry and there were grunts of approval from
the warriors

  the boys of the band were now hysterical
in their excitement and danced impatiently
while the fourth victim was led out they
selected their arrows with care and crowded
each other to get the most advantageous
positions as a result of their excitement
the islinois did not die until the fourth
volley and more than a hundred and fifty
shafts were imbedded in his flesh his
bonds were cut and he fell forward driving
a score of arrows entirely through his body

  dick the spell of goddins death scene
still upon him stood calmly in his place


adventure

he watched each successive victim as he
was led forward saw the swift flight of the
arrows heard the body splash into the
waters of the great river

  the fifth islinois died with the third
flight of arrows from the boys and only one
remained before dicks turn would come
for they were evidently holding him for the
last the sixth was led forward and one
youngster edging ahead of the others and
not waiting until the guards had retreated
from the tree let fly an arrow which cleanly
entered the victims mouth

  a roar of laughter swept over the men
and women and the other boys incensed
that one of their number had taken an
advantage fell to arguing among them-
selves laughter convulsed the savages as
they stared at the victim a shaft protruding
from his mouth a thin line of blood running
down his chin

  at last one by one then two and three
at a time the boys began drawing their
bows again there was a twang a slight
hiss as the feathered shaft twisted in its
flight and miraculously itseemed another ar-
row suddenly appeared in the prisoners flesh

  quickly the number increased blood
drenched the savages naked chest and
ran in streams down his legs he stood
there head erect eyes unblinking and still
the bows twanged until it seemed that there
was not room for another arrow above his
waist then simultaneously two shafts
struck his eyes and his head fell forward

  beginning with the laughter over the
first arrow  protruding from the mans
mouth and the excitement and quarrel
of the youthful executioners the slow death
of the last of the islinois had wrought up
the entire band men and women shrieked
and yelled and danced about but the
instant the prisoner was killed everything
was quiet

  dick fascinated by the spectacle was
the last to realize the sudden stillness and
as he looked around he found every person
staring at him the boys nervous eager
were fitting their best arrows to their bows

chapter xiv

a nadouaissioux

for a moment dick had the impulse to
turn upon his captors to attack his
guards barehanded to run amuck among
them and compel a quick death it was

not that he believed he might escape that
he might compel acknowledgment of his
courage it was simply the white mans
way to die the savage is schooled through
the generations to die haughtily even at
the stake the white man must go out
in a blaze of fierce endeavor and action

  even as he turned and saw that he could
easily grasp the war club of a man near him
he knew that he would not try he had
chosen a life among the savages had chosen
to play their game he would follow it
to the end and die according to their custom
though he were white he could do no more
here than die as dies the savage

  in the silence that had descended upon
the crowd the young virginian turned
toward the guards and held out his hands
they stepped toward him grasped his
wrists and led him to the tree

  the boys their youthful minds inflamed
during the execution of the six islinois
hysterical even in the unusual excitement
were silent and nervous while the white
man was bound here was unknown
game here was flesh their flint and
obsidian had never penetrated here was
a representative of that unknown and
mysterious race who drove their arrows
with thunder who made keen tools of iron
and who came from a marvelous land far
beyond the stinking water

  the youngsters did not falter did not
shrink from the task before them but their
bows trembled and there was an unnatural
stiffness in their bearing as they stood
ready

  in that nervous condition dick saw that
what he most dreaded would be inevitable
if the boys were cool and unexcited death
would be quick in their present state the
prolonged agony of the islinois would be
nothing with what he must suffer the
thought of numberless arrows sticking into
his flesh none with force enough to bring
the end was maddening and impulsively
he began to speak

  listen he called in a loud voice

  the half-drawn bows of the boys straight-
ened there was a quick movement of the
crowd toward him

  though i am a white man i can die as
well as can your own people the vir-
ginian said but i have lived as a man
and i wish to die as a man when i fought
i fought as a man in the open face to face
with my enemy that is the way the
before marquette



white man wants to die facing his enemy
not a crowd of children with their childs
weapons

  you are not my enemies i have never
harmed you but you think i have and
you are going to kill me you are a big
people and a just people slow to anger and
i know that you will grant the wish of a
man who is about to die

  what is the white mans wish asked
the chief when dick paused

  send those children to their mothers
skirts he cried fiercely put men in their
places let mens bows be drawn not bows
that are used to kill blackbirds along the
river that is what i ask

  it was a demand rather than a request
its effect was apparent the men began
to speak in whispers among themselves
the chief waved the boys back the
warriors seemed naturally to form a large
circle several began preparations to make
speeches but an old man stiff from years
of hunting and fighting and exposure
stepped forward and began to address
them

  you all know me he said you all
know that my loss in the treachery of the
islinois was double that of any one else
you know that my two sons the only
children i had the only support of an old
man and their mother were killed you
know that i face my old age without the
comfort and care of children that i am
doomed to loneliness and sorrow until the
end i am like the broken reed in the river
in the moon of the rut of the moose the
winds and the currents have their will with
me i am too weak to hold against them

  the white man we hold as prisoner was
present when my sons were killed by the
treacherous islinois he says he tried to
prevent the murder from his actions
today i would believe him but whether
he is guilty or not he was there he was
with the islinois came to the bartering-
place with them was with the hunting-
party that brought so much sorrow to us

  the white man has shown himself to be
brave he has looked upon death with
steady eyes and firm lips he has shown
that he can die as we would all like to die

  he has the bow that kills with thunder
arrows he has a hatchet and knife of iron
while we have only stone he can paddle
and he can hunt

  my people i want this young man for

a son i need him to provide-for me in
my old age to kill moose and beaver that
i may not starve to bring skins that i may
not freeze i wish to take him into my
home to call him son and have him call
me father the white man and the
islinois robbed me of all that i have let
them give back what they can

  as the old man took his seat in the circle
and the customary silence ensued dick
looked eagerly at the faces of the warriors
he knew the savages often adopted pris-
oners into their own families to take the
places of those slain in war the iroquois
had kept their ranks full by adopting entire
tribes

  but what gave him the greatest hope
was the fact that a prisoner thus adopted
never endeavors to return to his own people
it is the accepted belief that he has died
that his former existence has ended and
that into his body has come the spirit of
the slain warrior whose place he lakes
once adopted dick knew that the na-
douaissioux would not question his accept-
ance of the savage theory but would treat
him immediately as one of the band would
permit him to go and come as he pleased
and that would mean virginia before the
winter snows

  other warriors leaders in the band arose
and spoke briefly dick straining against
his bonds listened eagerly to every word
not one showed a desire to thwart the
request of the old man only additional
reasons for the adoption of the captive
were proposed

  at the end the chief nodded and several
young men ran to the tree to sever the
thongs that bound the virginian to it
he was escorted into the circle and formally
presented to the father whose sons had been
slain and so with a few simple cere-
monies and much smoking of the calumet
dick jeffreys became a nadouaissioux

  in the three days that the band remained
on the prairie the virginian devoted him-
self to establishing firmly the belief that he
had taken the place of the sons who were
slain the morning after the execution of
the islinois he went off early with his
musket and alone he crossed the prairie
to a great rock-crowned bluff and followed
its base into the valley which opened to
the east

  he went on into this for more than a
league and by sheer luck encountered a


adventure

small herd of wild cattle in a wooded valley
he crept close killed a huge bull at the first
shot and loaded again in time to kill another
before the herd stampeded then loading
as he ran he climbed the side and met the
galloping animals face to face as they
rounded the end of the ridge a third
went down and before the last were out of
range a fourth was mortally wounded

  the buffalo had turned toward the west
and as dick made his way back to the
encampment he encountered them again
getting two more and finishing the one he
had wounded he then hurried back to
the savages and asked that the women
be sent out after the meat at night
when they returned a hundred of them
each carrying all the meat her strength
permitted the camp was in an uproar
in the feast that followed dick was ac-
corded the place of honor

  the band moved on up the river once
they found a herd of buffalo swimming the
stream and again dicks musket won
respect the grief-stricken father who
had adopted him strutted about the camp
and boasted of his sons prowess the
boys who would have slain him a few days
before followed him in awe the old men
of the band accorded his every word their
closest attention his counsel was invited
and respected

dick did not overlook any oppor-
tunities to cement his hold upon
the nadouaissioux he found them
entirely different from any savages he had
ever encountered they were mild pleas-
ant amiable people the men were tall
and well formed though the women were
more ugly than is usually the case with
savages every member of the band even
to the infants began the day with a bath
in the river

  the virginian easily fell into their mode
of life quickly adopted all their customs
established the best of terms with the men
and in a week he was to all outward
appearances a savage

  yet not once in all that time did he forget
the one thing that prompted these actions
he studied the canoes which were smaller
and lighter than his own and better adapted
to his long journey he even chose the
one he would take when he made his dash
to the southward

  he strolled about the camp after dark

learning the habits of the various individual
members of the band noting the hour when
they retired marking down those who were
prone to sit late about a fire and gossip
he made friends with the numberless
dogs of the encampment surreptitiously
tossed them pieces of meat and then tested
them by walking through the camp at
night

 he was up at dawn watching to see
which members of the band were the earliest
risers when he had learned who each
was he began to express a choice in the
location of his own cabine at night that
when he had gone his absence might be
discovered as late as possible

  a week after he had been adopted dick
decided that the first cloudy nightwould
suffice for his attempt every detail which
could insure success had been planned
he had secreted a supply of dried meat
and wild oats on the bank to be picked up
on his return had chosen two good paddles
and selected a small narrow canoe capable
of unusual speed

  the morning of the eighth day after his
adoption the band began its leisurely jour-
ney northward in a fine drizzle the low
clouds drifted before a south wind there
was every indication that they would
hang low through the night at least dick
recognized his chance and resolved to take
it in that swift current he could travel
twenty-four hours a day sleeping in the
bottom of the canoe as he had done on the
ouisconsin

  he should gain at least twelve hours
start perhaps more and in that twelve
hours he could gain twenty-five leagues
his pursuers when they came would
travel faster but his experience with the
ouinibegous had given him confidence and
he knew that the nadouaissioux would not
dare venture too far south for fear of the
islinois

  as dick paddling unconsciously went
over and over his plans the leading canoes
passed out of sight around a bend when
he suddenly became aware of his surround-
ings he found that less than an hour after
the start the fleet of birchbarks had strung
out along the shore of a large lake

 with the south wind helping the
nadouaissioux made all possible speed
the lake was more than ten leagues long
dick was told and the high bluffs on either
side were the home of fierce winds that
before marquette



always lay in wait for the savages that
they might devour the canoes men
women and children showed their fear by
paddling swiftly it seemed to be the
desire of every one to cross the lake as
quickly as possible

  half a league out dick found to his
dismay that the current had ceased
the lake was only an enlargement of the
great stream but it was a lake should
the south wind hold he could make no
more than a league an hour against it
the great lead he had counted upon would
be cut in half he might not be able even
to get off the lake before he would be
seen

  though he cursed himself for not having
begun his dash the night before for not
having made inquiries as to the route
ahead there was nothing to do except
go on he was trapped and all he could
hope for was a fiercer wind that would
drive the savages to camp on the western
shore then with only a small stretch
of the lake between him and the river
he could get away

  the wind did increase driving the
canoes before it sending the water swishing
and surging alongside in curling rollers
dicks heart leaped at each successive
blast but the savages kept on paddling
harder shouting hopefully to one another
a race was on a race between the wind
and mounting seas and the canoes with
the finish line a point setting out from the
western shore around which there would
be shelter

  dick kept on with the others his foster-
parents paddling with amazing strength
looking anxiously over their shoulders at
the storm clouds behind them dick
prayed that they would lose begrudged
each league that slipped behind them
was incensed that the wind did not make
further progress too dangerous he began
to see that the entire success of his plan
depended upon being driven ashore before
the shelter of the distant point was
reached

  but the wind settled to a steady blow
the little canoes rose and fell with the
rollers in safety and at noon the entire
fleet had rounded the point and stopped
to rest in its shelter from the point
dick could see the end of the lake about
three leagues to the northwest across a
broad expanse of water the lake would

require a whole nights strenuous paddling
under favorable conditions he estimated
and if the wind kept up he could not hope
to get out of sight

  the savages after a rest started on
they kept close to the west shore out of
the wind but each member of the band
had a watchful eye on the clouds their
fear of the lake and the storms that swept
it kept them working steadily and when
sunset came they had reached the mouth
of the river

  the land was low swampy the stream
divided into many channels and as the
great fleet left the lake it separated into
three divisions dick and his foster-
parents were with a score of canoes that
entered a swift narrow place bordered
by high rushes tired by their strenuous
exertions since morning they made head-
way with difficulty the channel nar-
rowed the current became more swift
dusk was settling over the water

  then suddenly out of the reeds on either
side darted a flotilla of small canoes each
manned by four naked painted whooping
savages

  arrows fairly rained upon the nadouais-
sioux many were wounded paddles
dropped from nerveless hands and floated
off down-stream one canoe overturned
and the heads of children bobbed in the
current shrill yells came across the
marshes indicating that the attack was
simultaneous in all the channels

  as dick saw the canoes dash out from
both sides his first thought was to flee
whoever the attackers were it was not
his battle but before he could turn his
craft the enemy were among the nadouais-
sioux and war-clubs were swinging right
and left one canoe dashed straight toward
dicks and he laid aside his paddle for his
musket and fired into the face of the leading
savage just as he was about to brain his
foster-mother

  the two canoes swung together broad-
side a war-club crashed into the skull
of dicks foster-father the virginian
whirled his musket and knocked the second
savage into the water but before he could
recover his balance the third brought down
his club

  dick swerved it caught him a glanc-
ing blow on the side of the head and
he fell unconscious upon the body of the
old nadouaissioux

the promise

the war-party of the otjibwa known
to the french as the saulteurs because
they were first found at the sault ste
marie numbered less than half as many
men as the nadouaissioux but their attack
was so sudden and so wholly unexpected
and the nadouaissioux were at such a
disadvantage the slaughter was terrific
for a time the savages from lac superior
cracked heads wherever they showed male
female or infant and the early darkness
alone saved their victims from complete
annihilation

  that dick jeffreys lived was due to the
quick wit of his foster-mother the canoes
of the attacking party had swept past when
she found herself alone in the bow of their
craft and she immediately turned drove
across the current and hid in the reeds
sounds of the battle came from down-
stream and both sides but soon died away
as the current swept every one out into
the lake the old woman judged that
none remained between her and the upper
river and stealthily she shoved out and
began to paddle northward

  the clouds were low the darkness intense
the river mouth was a vast marsh high
reeds bordered the narrow channels and
islands were numerous the old woman
knew every nook of the river and in two
hours she had traveled so far from the lake
she dared go ashore and ascertain if her
men were dead or only wounded she
turned her canoe into a tree-roofed slough
and crept forward to feel of their bodies
dick was breathing but her husbands
hands were cold and blood no longer flowed
from his crushed head

  as she knelt over them she heard the
swish of water behind her and saw the dark
shadow of a canoe against the brighter
river as she watched another and another
passed stealthily like ghosts and she
knew that her people wfere retreating in
the darkness she pushed out into the
stream and all night toiled with the others
against the current

  dawn found their paddles still plying
steadily and they did not stop until they
were a league beyond a river flowing into
the misisepe from the north the route by
which the attackers had come the entire

party numbering only a pitiful dozen
canoes hid in a slough while three un-
wounded warriors in a single canoe went on
to warn the great body of their people
who they knew would be camped at the
big falls of the great river

  dicks foster-mother weary as she was
did all she could do for the wounded man
she removed the body of her husband and
made a soft bed for the virginian in the
bottom of the canoe she felt of the great
welt on the side of his head pressed against
the skull and grunted with satisfaction
on finding that it had not been crushed
she washed the blood from his head and
neck bathed his face and crooned over him
in an effort to bring him to consciousness

  but the hours went by and the vir-
ginian lay in the bottom of the canoe his
face white his eyes closed his chest rising
and falling only slightly and with ominous
pauses between

  later in the afternoon a boy stationed on
the bank of the main channel reported that
the warriors were passing and the fugitives
paddled out of their hiding-place to see a
hundred canoes each driven by four men
speeding down with the current to cut off
the saulteurs and avenge the deaths of
their people

  dicks foeer-mother toiled the remainder
of the day to traverse the six leagues re-
maining before the main encampment of
her people was reached and then exhausted
she turned her patient over to others

  the morning of the second day dick
opened his eyes for the first time he
was too weak to move and he believed at
first that the thunder in his ears was due
to his injury for in all his travels on the
misisepe he had not found even a rapids
he was lying in a bark cabine alone but
soon his foster-mother entered to retreat
at once with loud shouts of joy that brought
a crowd to the door broth was poured
between his ups his face and head bathed
and he dropped off to sleep

  the recovery of the virginian was a
matter of weeks not days willing hands
bore him each morning to the trees above
the great falls which frenchmen were to
see a few years later and name st anthony
women brought him food the choicest
parts of the game old men came and sat
beside him smoking for hours in absolute
silence if he showed no desire for con-
versation
before marquette



  the war-party returned with a score of
 prisoners and long tales of vengeance
 the saulteurs had been dispersed some
 fleeing into the forest others down the
 river all cut off for the time from their own
 country to the northeast

  again dick was amazed at the tolerance
 of the nadouaissioux ten prisoners were
 executed as had been the islinois the
 others after witnessing the execution were
 set free and told to report to their people
 that the nadouaissioux had not sought war
 that they desired peace with the saulteurs
 but that their neighbors were guilty of the
 foulest treachery and would be exterminated
 if ever again they committed such an act

  the methods of torture dick had seen
to the eastward and which he believed
were practised by all savages were un-
known among the nadouaissioux it was
a custom to be adopted later after the
effects of the iroquois raids had been felt
in the valley of the misisepe

  yet the people with whdffi dick found
himself called themselves poualaks or
warriors the name nadouaissioux mean-
ing a snake or enemy having been
given them by the saulteurs the french
soon reduced this to sioux and the amiable
brave honest people who spread from the
misisepe to the great mountains to the
west those who spared their prisoners and
wept copiously at will were the ancestors
of the followers of sitting bull

  dick believed his recovery would be
short virginia was ever in his mind
july had come but there was still time for
him to escape for his dash of several hun-
dred leagues down the great river but a
week after he arrived at the falls he dis-
covered that his right side was partially
paralyzed sometimes he could move his
right arm or leg but he never could be
certain a day might go by without his
being able to walk

  at first this brought a greater despond-
 ency than at any time since the death of
 antoine goddin there was a chance
 when he had been captured by the islinois
 still a chance when he was bound to the
 tree before the nadouaissioux boys now
 he saw none a thousand leagues of
 unknown wilderness lay between him and
 his destination a thousand leagues of
 paddling portaging hunting his living
 dodging hostile savages finding his way
 not only a stout heart but a whole body

 was necessary and he could not even swing
 a paddle could not lift his musket to his
 shoulder could not be certain but that the
 next step would topple him to the ground

   it was maddening and for the first time
dick refused even after days of contempla-
tion to accept his fate without bitterness
savages he could fight or outwit strange
waters could be navigated trackless forests
could be traversed but this was something
wholly beyond his power to combat idle
chafing cursing each day that found him
still at the falls he saw july pass there
was no improvement the blow on the
left side of his head had injured his brain
or certain nerve-centers and he saw a life-
time of hobbling crawling beggary among
savages who as time passed would lose their
awe for his color would forget that he had
killed two of the saulteurs in their disastrous
battle down the misisepe

   the first of august nearly all the people
gathered at the great falls began to depart
for their winter home among the in-
numerable lakes at the source of the mis-
isepe there among the wild oats marshes
secure from attack and provided with grain
and beaver and moose for the winter they
would remain until the following spring

   there was nothing for dick but to accom-
pany them his foster-mother paddled
him he hobbled or crawled across portages
warriors gave them of their game were
glad of the honor of carrying his musket
some insinuated that dick should teach
them its use and give them powder and
balls but he had only a small amount of
ammunition and even in the face of this
last disaster he could not give up all hope
that some day he might recover and start
back to virginia

  it was on this journey to the winter
home of the nadouaissioux that peace was
arranged with the saulteurs dick had
heard of the power of the calumet had seen
the reverence in which the islinois held it
had been told by goddin of its might among
all the western tribes the sioux espe-
cially kept all sworn promises with an
inviolable fidelity and the ceremony of the
calumet meant that absolute trust could be
placed upon them

   the calumet itself originally a stick of
wood two or three feet long a quarter of
an inch thick and two inches wide pierced
from end to end so that the breath or spirit
might pass through it had in dicks time


adventure

a bowl at one end in which to smoke the
sacred tobacco the whole affair was
usually gorgeously decorated and many
of the tribes knew and practised a dance
and chant in honor of the calumet itself

  since dick had become a nadouaissioux
and had gained the confidence of the older
men of the tribe they often talked to him
of the calumet and its power it could be
used in all things as a passport to distant
tribes to ratify peace pacts or treaties
to secure good weather to bring rain to
attest contracts and to declare war

but not until he witnessed the
treaty with the saulteurs had he
realized the really impressive cere-
monies with which it could be smoked
for this was its most important use dick
was accorded a seat in the front circle of
warriors and as he watched the chiefs of
the two nations gravely blowing the smoke
toward the sky the four world quarters
and the earth earnestly invoking the sun
and other spirits as witnesses to their
vows of sacred kinship he could not but
be impressed by the sincerity of the par-
ticipants

 through september the savages were
busy with the harvest of wild oats huge
quantities were gathered in the great
marshes and put away for winter the
women worked from morning to night
driving their canoes through the tall stalks
and beating the kernels into the bottom
with short sticks the wild oats marshes
were the property of the sioux and even
then were becoming a bone of contention
with the salteurs and starting a warfare
that was to last through nearly two cen-
turies

  with the first snows of fall dick dis-
covered that his paralysis was leaving him
daily he began to have more and more use
of his right arm and right leg a fierce
exaltation seized him each morning he
tested his limbs tried to walk to lift
things if he were able to get away before
the first ice in the lakes could reach the
swift current of the misisepe he could keep
ahead of winter in its southward rush
could at least reach the ohio before frost
closed the waterways that would be
half his journey and he would risk the
danger and privation of the rest before
spring virginia would have the news of his
discovery

  but he was too eager pressed his recov-
ery too hard his nerves ceased entirely
to function and shivering despondent he
lay beside the fire in the birchbark cabine
as winter gripped the northern land

  it was then that dick jeffreys for the
first time thought of other things in vir-
ginia than his mission and governor berke-
ley with the savages there had been
constant human contact but never human
fellowship the oil was stirred into the
water but never merged with it never could
be absorbed ever since the death of
antoine goddin dick had felt a void which
even his breathless impatience to return
to virginia could not entirely fill

  now lying beside a small fire in a low
evil-smelling cabine shut in by the fierce
winter of the north despondent comfort-
less his mind turned to the people of vir-
ginia there was his father alone like
himself with even a deeper personal sorrow
perhaps mortally wounded by what he
would consider as the complete disgrace
of his son there was elizabeth carver
betsykins the one person in the colony
who had been a real companion who had
more nearly understood him and she like
his father had been left with a great mis-
understanding had in the end been de-
prived even of that wonderful faith in
him

  dick sometimes marveled at this trust
of the girl whom he still considered as he
had that last night under the sycamores
as a romping boyish carefree comrade
even now he failed to understand how he
had hurt her in that last interview still
believed it was his irreverence for kings
that had shocked her royalist ears

  in his foster-mother alone did dick find
comfort like many indian women who
have passed middle age who have seen
winters and famines and wars come and
go leaving their trail of suffering and
sorrow and death she was a strong noble
virile character though the nadouais-
sioux did not accord their women a high
place she had won to a certain influence
through the sheer dominance of her will
her keen intellect and her biting tongue
which were in fact the only qualities of
leadership possessed even by the men

  her sharp comments her shrewd de-
ductions her knowledge of savage nature
expressed openly or in long conversations
with the leading men had resulted in her
before marquette



wielding a power in the band that was not
second even tp the chiefs the deaths
of her two sons and husband had brought
a certain bitterness a vindictiveness that
had won advantageous terms in the treaty
with the saulteurs but it had also in her
loneliness brought a great affection for
the white man who had become her son
on dick she lavished her tenderness that
mother love which is so often consuming
among savage people and in time her
quick intuition and shrewd observation
led to a discovery of his ambitions and
hopes

  your body is here but your heart is
not she said to him one night as they sat
beside the fire our people can become
the children of another nation when
adopted but the white man can not
change his heart any more than he can
change his skin

  dick did not reply he had a certain
fondness for the old woman a great respect
but he did not know that he could confide
in her

  you can trust me she uncannily
answered his thought i am your mother
and i know my son

  dick looked at the wrinkled dark-
skinned face with the straight black hair
brushed back from a low forehead in
the hard-pressed mouth the thick nose
the expression that always was stern and
forbidding he found nothing assuring
but in the eyes black unwavering he
found truth the mother love a real tender-
ness that belied the stern features

  you are right mother he answered
impulsively i am not happy here i can
not be you have been as kind to me as
your own flesh and blood your people
have been brothers i should not ask more

  but and his eyes glowed as he sat
up and faded her across the fire my
heart can never be here it is in the place
where i was born where i have always
lived where my father white-haired sor-
rowing waits for me my land is far away
and i would have been there now had
not the islinois falsely accused me and
taken me prisoner i must go back to
my home mother i must go

  the old woman studied him shrewdly for
a moment

  there is a woman she said at last
you have not cared for the young women
of our people

  no there is none answered dick
earnestly it is because i love my land
and my people and because i can not be
happy away from them

  for a long time she sat looking into the
fire the flickering blaze enhanced the
savagery of her features her brown
knotted toil-cramped hands were clasped
about her knees her eyes stared un-
wavering unblinking complete masks for
her thoughts

  my son she said at last you have not
told me all it is not a woman for a
woman brings another light to a mans
eyes it is not the sickness of much
thinking for the longing for home dulls
them you have not told me all and i do
not ask it i am an old woman one who
never before saw white men and who am
i to understand them white men harness
the thunder cut and harden the iron make
signs with black water that are the same
as words why then should they not
have thoughts that we can not know

  but you are my son even my flesh
and blood and your happiness is my happi-
ness i would rather see you laughing
with your own people than sorrowing with
mine when the spring comes you will
go

  go cried dick excitedly but i can
not lift a paddle

  you will be well and strong when the
snow has melted

  but the chiefs your people the
calumet was sung and danced at my
adoption

  and the calumet shall take you safely
to your own people

  how do you mean

  leave that to me my son i am old
my life is spent i will never again see
the harvest of the wild oats never again
suffer through another winter my hus-
band is gone my two strong sons you
have been as a son to me but why should
you remain here after i am gone

  but they will follow bring me back
and the calumet has been smoked

you smoked it to save your life and
what is the calumet to a white man he
has other vows and you gave none of
them content yourself my son when
the ice is gone from the lakes your canoe
will be turned toward the south in the
moon of the crane you will go and because
you shall bear the calumet in the moon of


adventure

the rut of the elk you will come to your
own people

chapter xvi

virginia

not again through the long winter did
the old woman refer to dicks return
to virginia impatient eager he spoke
to her one evening

  does my son doubt my word she
asked sternly

  as he lay beside the fire trying to deter-
mine whether she had spoken boastfully
idly or whether she was really able to effect
his escape from the nadouaissioux he dis-
covered that the first of her predictions
was coming true day by day he began
to regain the use of his arm and leg by
midwinter he could walk without assist-
ance and could carry his musket his
strength returned and before spring he
was hunting moose and beaver with the
men of the band

  in the winter the nadouaissioux scattered
through the great lake country in
various places only a few leagues apart
small villages of a few families were estab-
lished this gave to each an undisturbed
game district and in summer made it
impossible for enemies to surprise the band
before the foe had exterminated one
settlement the word would be carried to
the many others

  dick and his foster-mother had wintered
on a small lake twenty leagues from the
southernmost village they were off the
main stream of the misisepe separated
from it by many small lakes and portages
and there were half a dozen villages on the
route

  when the moon of the carp was in the
last quarter and the snow had begun to
go the old nadouaissioux woman suddenly
announced that she was about to make a
journey and that she wished dick to go
with her she had a small sledge upon
which she bound food robes and a mys-
terious bundle which she had been guarding
carefully all through the winter dick
though he could get no hint as to the object
of her expedition but hoping that it might
mean the fulfilment of her promise was
eager to accompany her because she was
old he asked to be allowed to pull the
sledge but she sternly informed him that

  his duty was to go ahead and hunt leaving
womans work to her

  each night they stopped in one of the
small marsh-bound villages here for
the first time since dick had known her
she showed an interest in petty village
gossip her stories of their own intentions
and experiences both amused and disturbed
the virginian but so great was his con-
fidence in her he did not ask questions
back of it all he felt that there must be
some motive some purpose so he sat
silently beside the camp-fires while she
asked innumerable trivial questions and
inquired into every action through the
winter of every one she met

  at the end of the week they passed the
last village still the old woman kept on
and they camped that night in the open
but her garrulity had ceased as suddenly
as it began now she sat for long hours
beside the fire of dead pine staring un-
blinkingly into the flames she kept her
thoughts to herself offered no explanation
to dick of their mysterious journey each
night he fell asleep while she sat thus and
each morning he wakened to find her there
apparently she never slept

  for another week she led him on into
the south along the frozen bed of the
misisepe which was now only a small
winding stream neither as they trudged
on through the day nor as they sat beside
the fire at night did she speak as the
time passed she seemed to grow more
feeble to become more weary after the
days toil but always her eyes were
bright and steady and each night she
refused tostop until darkness made further
progress on the rotting ice impossible

  the afternoon of the ninth day after
leaving the last village she turned toward
the shore and pushed the brush aside

  it is here she said simply we can
rest until the river breaks its bonds
dick from his position behind her
caught a glimpse of red birchbark behind
the bushes

  a canoe he exclaimed

  did you think i wasted my breath in
all that foolish chatter in the villages
she asked sharply did you think i aired
for gossip of all their silly doings

  and you asked thousands of ques-
tion to -

  to learn one thing that this canoe
was here behind these bushes now my
before marquette



son we have only to wait until the ice is
gone it will be soon for the moon of the
crane is new and i said that in the moon
of the crane you would start to find your
own people

  now that she had reached the canoe
before the rotting ice drove her to the
difficult travel along the bank the old
woman was more cheerful and communi-
cative the first night after a supper of
wild rice and moose meat she brought out
the mysterious bundle and untied it it
was long and thin and the outer wrapping
of tanned moosehide disclosed a hunting
shirt fringed and decorated with bands of
porcupine quills without a word she
handed it to dick

  his astonished thanks were sincere
for he knew that the quill work had re-
quired every spare moment of the winter
but his eyes were fixed in what still re-
mained in his foster-mothers hands it
was the reason for the odd shape of the
bundle a long richly ornamented calumet
dick recognized it at once as the most
sacred possession of the nadouaissioux
the same pipe with which the treaty with
the saulteurs had been affirmed

  his foster-mother was busy however
with another and smaller bundle as she
unwrapped the skin dick exclaimed in
amazement she held half a dozen small
bells the tongue of each bound with a
thong so that it would be noiseless

  where did you get them he demanded
as he looked at these unaccountable evi-
dences of trade with europeans

  listen my son she began this
calumet will bear you safely through the
lands of strange people only show it
wave it toward the sun smoke it with the
people you meet and you may pass un-
harmed never was there a calumet so
powerful the people of any nation who
see it will recognize it at once

  the shirt you must wear always upon
it i have sewed quills of colors and in
forms and figures which denote my prayers
for your safety these are as the words
the white man makes with the black water
this and she pointed to a row of odd
figures will preserve you from storms
this one will assure you fair weather
this will keep you safe from the jaws of
wild beasts and the monsters you will meet
far down the great water this will
preserve you from the treachery of people

like the islinois and others who have no
honor i have spent the winter working
these prayers upon your shirt that i might
know my son will be safe

  the bells our people once received from
the hurons when they came to trade
before we learned their black hearts and
drove them far to the east a few sum-
mers ago the outaouas attacked our people
in the great marshes where we spent the
winter they became lost and our war-
riors surrounded them they hid like the
ducks with only their heads above water
crawling in the wild oats and reeds

  for a long time our warriors waited
but they did not come out we knew
they had not escaped for there were no
signs at last the warriors found only one
piece of dry land where the outaouas could
leave the marsh and across this in the
grass and brush they stretched a fish net
and to that they tied these bells which
they had received in trade from the hurons
then in the night the outaouas crawled
like snakes through the marsh and in the
darkness thrust their heads against the net
and caused the bells to ring our warriors
came and slew a hundred of them all except
one who was sent back to his people with
the story of how we deal with those capable
of such treachery

  these bells are a sacred possession of
our people but now they are yours in
your long journey you must go alone must
have time to sleep each night you are to
tie strings to the brush near where you
sleep and place these bells upon them
then you will be warned in time

dick was overwhelmed by the
thoroughness of his foster-mothers
preparations but in her every act
he saw only disaster for herself

  i can not let you do this he cried
what will your people say when they
learn that the calumet and the bells are
gone what will become of you when
they learn you have taken them and to aid
me to escape

  where are my sons wits she replied
scornfully do you think you could have
passed through all those villages alone
could have reached the great water
without setting every one to talking and
to thinking without having a band of
warriors at your heels do you think
you could have passed on the ice without


adventure

it being known and if you had waited
for the ice to go where would you have
found a canoe and how could you have
carried one past the villages my people
believe you are one of them but a little
thing would have given them strange
thoughts and you would never have
reached the big falls

  that was another reason for my talking
i told them my dead husbands spirit had
come to me in the winter and told that
the beasts had destroyed his grave and left
him uncovered they think i am going
to cover my dead anew and that you go to
help me

  but you after taking these things
after all that you have done what will
your fate be when you return

  your wits still hop about like the bugs
in the grass she answered i am not
going back

  but you-you-you dont intend to go
with me

  i will go with you my son so far as
the prairie where my sons died there i
too will die i only hope that i will live
long enough to reach the spot

  but you are not ready to die there
are still years of happiness for you

  there is never happiness for the old
women of my people when we are old
and useless no one cares for us our chil-
dren have duties of their own the mouths
of their own children to feed their own
families to protect from the enemy there
is no happiness in the lives of the old
their thoughts are in the past their
fingers are stiff and can not sew garments
their legs are feeble and they can not
hunt enough to eat their arms are stiff
and they can not gather enough wood to
keep them warm through the winter
when one is too old to work one is too old
to live yonder is the last new moon
i shall ever see

  while they waited for the ice to go dick
tried to persuade her to return to her people
with the calumet and the bells only to find
her purpose unshakable her husband
and her sons dead her adopted son on the
way to his own people life held nothing
she declared and she only feared that she
would not live long enough to reach the
grave of her sons

  dick could not understand her assurance
that she could time her death so accurately
she had marched long hours each day

dragging the sledge she seemed to be
strong and well and yet when the ice
had rotted the river had opened and at
last they had embarked on the long journey

he saw that her paddle was ineffectual
that she made only the motions before
they reached the great falls she was forced
to admit that she could no longer gather
the firewood and cook the meals only in
her eyes black blazing unquenchable did
life seem to remain

  dick now that he had started at last
for virginia now that he was on his way
with the message he bore paddled steadily
through the long days the river swelling
hourly bore him swiftly but his paddle
shot the little canoe even faster the great
falls were passed and the lake where the
saulteurs had ambushed the nadouaissioux
landmarks slipped by one after the other
and he knew that two or three more days
would see him at the mouth of the ouis-
consin

   but as he watched the silent figure curled
in the bow he wondered if she would live
to see her desire fulfilled for days she
had lain there in the bottom of the canoe
motionless uncomplaining her wasted body
consumed bit by bit by the fire of her un-
conquerable will as dicks fear that she
would die any hour became greater her
desire became his and he pressed on early
and late driving his little craft with the
one purpose of reaching the bartering-place
in time

  it was mid-afternoon of a bright april
day when at last he turned into a channel
setting in toward the eastern bank and shot
down to the prairie above the mouth of the
ouisconsin it was deserted the bare
poles of cabines scattered over the plain
seemed like ghosts of the thousands who
had thronged the place when he had last
seen it

  as he approached the bank he feared
that he might be too late for hours he
had not seen a movement of the silent figure
in the bow he stepped ashore and leaned
over her

  we are here my son she said as her
eyes opened you have your mothers
thanks carry me up so that i can see
the prairie and i will die in sight of the place
where my sons lie

  he lifted her from the canoe and carried
her to a knoll from which she could look
out over the plain to the bare bluffs beyond
before marquette



for a few moments she sat there only her
eyes moving then they closed and for
the second time on the banks of the great
unknown streams of the great unknown
wilderness dick felt that he was alone

  as carefully as with the body of antoine
goddin he prepared a final resting-place
for her after the white mans fashion he
dug deep in the soft earth and piled stones
upon the grave then with his ramrod
he burned an inscription in english upon a
hewn board

  sorrowfully and slowly he paddled away
caught the current and was swept down
and across to the bluff at the base of which
he had buried antoine just a year before
for an hour he sat beside the tomb he had
built gazing out over the river recalling
the last moments with his friend

  good-by antoine he said softly as
he arose

in his abstraction dick paddled
until dark before he went ashore
on an island to camp for the night
day after day passed and he drifted down
the mighty river which constantly grew
larger as streams flowed in from either side
the towering bluffs at last gave way to
sweeping prairies game was abundant
the weather delightful peace and con-
tentment seemed to hold the land but
always dick paddled always he pressed on
spurred anew by the thought of the two
graves he had left at the mouth of the
ouisconsin

  islands were numerous and afforded
comparatively safe camping-places one
night however he tried the western shore
and in the morning wakened to find a group
of strange savages about him soberly he
filled and lighted the calumet waved it to
the sun and the four quarters of the earth
and then passed it to the strangers to smoke

  the magic of the pipe was more potent
than he had dreamed annoyingly so for
they insisted upon taking him to their
village and feasting him for three days
before he was escorted back to the river
he found they were the ottos a branch of
the ouinibegous distant cousins of the
nadouaissioux there was no difficulty
in understanding their dialect and from
them dick learned that the wilderness
now taking the form of great plains ex-
tended for several leagues to the westward
ending at the great mountains without a

sign of salt water on the plains were
many and strange nations and beyond the
mountains it was reported were still other
lands and other people

  the ottos warned dick that he would
find savage people and still more savage
monsters if he continued on the great
water but he fired his musket to show
what he could do and departed with their
best wishes

  a large stream flowed in from the east
which he took to be the rocky river
two noble streams joined the great water
from the west and still the boundless
prairies continued sometimes the mis-
isepe swung to the southeast or southwest
but almost always he traveled south

  at last he came to the mouth of a river
on the east which he believed to be that
of the islinois twice he had passed
villages of these people but had avoided
being seen except by a solitary hunter he
encountered on the shore

  immediately after passing the mouth of
the islinois dick came to the influx of a
stream on the western side it was a
turbulent muddy giant of a river rushing
into the beautiful calm misisepe dis-
coloring its waters causing great swirling
eddies taking possession of the valley and
dashing on carrying the canoe more swiftly
than it had ever traveled before dick
recognized it immediately as the great
stream of which western savages had
spoken as the bartering-place the year
before the pekitanoui or muddy river
afterward to be known through another
savage language as the missouri

  in the mammoth river in which he now
found himself dick began to watch eagerly
at last anxiously for the ohio from the
vegetation and the climate he judged that
he was as far south as virginia but still
he was traveling straight on

  his belief that the ohio joined the
misisepe was based on the rumor basile
pombert had heard from savages he had
seen and from his own knowledge of the
country he had traveled straight north
from the ohio nearly to lac mecheygan
on a large stream the islinois flowed from
nearly the same place and toward the
southwest in the great triangle between
there would not be room for another river
so large as the ohio and he reasoned that
the first big tributary on the east must be
the one he sought


adventure

  when he was about to despair beginning
to think of turning back fearing his
geographical guesses had been far wrong
he reached it and turned joyfully toward
the east	

  long days of toil followed the river
was high with a good current and it
turned and twisted in a manner that
became increasingly exasperating but
after a few days remembered landmarks
were passed and he went on with new
energy assured that his course was right
he spent almost every hour of the day
in the canoe but as his supply of wild rice
gave out he was often forced ashore for
game once he pressed on regardless of
food but the consequent weakness con-
vinced him of the folly of such a course

  twice the calumet won passage past
large villages of strange savages once
when he was cooking a meal on shore two
indians crept close in a thicket and his life
was saved by the prayers embroidered on
his hunting-shirt

  but he knew that once he had reached
the mountains at the head of the ohio
his calumet and quill-worked applications
to the spirits would be unavailing only
in the great valley of the misisepe did the
pipe hold sway then his skill as a woods-
man and blind chance alone could win
through to the settlements on the eastern
side of the blue mountains

  and they won through near the head
of the monongahela he abandoned the canoe
and struck into the wilderness he avoided
valleys in which he knew the savages would
gather kept on the high levels and slowly
cautiously wormed his way past

  in his concentration on the one purpose
to reach virginia dick never forgot that he
was only fighting his way to certain death
but not once since he had burned his in-
scription on the oak that towered above the
great water had this consideration even
made him falter scarcely in fact did
he even think that his achievement might
allay the hatred of berkeley if he had
thought of himself at all it was only that
his fate was insignificant in the face of his
duty

  this feeling increased with the strain of
constant watchfulness through the thou-
sand leagues of travel since he had left the
land of the nadouaissioux and his greatest
fear was not of berkeley but of failure
when the goal was almost in sight as

the strain increased there resulted a nervous
condition that made sleep at night only a
fitful jumble of dreams

  twice he had cause to be thankful for
the thoughtfulness of his foster-mother
when the bells tied to strings in bushes
near his resting-place warned him of the
presence of prowling savages each time
he risked the noise of firing his musket
for he knew that the entire tribe would be
at his heels if he permitted the prowler to
escape

  fifty leagues from jamestown dick
discovered the first evidence of an indian
uprising an isolated clearing far up
toward the foothills contained only the
blackened timbers of a cabin and the bones
of the settlers family he had realized
that in the colony of virginia itself where
long association with the whites had bred
an intense hatred and where governor
berkeleys fear for his fur trade had induced
a policy of no defense would come his
greatest danger

  with this evidence of the savages
hostility he could not tell whether it was
an isolated massacre or whether he would
find a string of ruined plantations across
the colony and the survivors besieged in
jamestown itself he kept to the thick
swamps the most inaccessible places
traveled only at night spent most of his
days in watching once he found the trail
of what he believed to be a small war-party
and again he saw a thick column of smoke
that undoubtedly rose from a burning
settlers home

  dick was greatly weakened by the strain
sleeplessness and lack of food days and
nights spent in the dark dismal swampland
his body wet and shivering finally had their
result when only a few leagues from his
fathers plantation the fever caught him

  still he forced himself to go on barely
a league a day he was almost too weak
to walk often delirium brought visions
of hatchet-swinging yelling savages bend-
ing over him one evening after dragging
himself forward all day he came out upon
the bank of the james down the stream
a little way he saw the bow of a canoe
hidden in the grass when darkness fell
he crawled into it pushed out into the
current and drifted down

  every inch of the land and water was
now familiar even at night in another
league he would reach the cleared fields of
before marquette



his fathers plantation a league beyond
that he would see the manor house outlined
against the sky if it were there if the
savages had confined their operations to
the outskirts of the settlement

a bend in the river suddenly dis-
closed the lighted buildings they
were safe jamestown was safe
he worked the canoe painfully and slowly
across the current to a point where he
knew he would strike the wharf in a few
minutes he was walking up the broad path

  the great hall door was open the win-
dows lighted but no one was to be seen
he crossed the broad veranda entered the
hall the door of the dining-room opened
and an old negro woman stepped out

  marse dick she shrieked and turned
to flee he caught her by the shoulder and
swung her back

  where is father he demanded

  is yo daid she demanded in terror

  no he answered sharply where is
father

  hes done gone over to marse carvers
fo de big dinner to his lawdship an de
gobernor marse dick where yo been

  the governor governor berkeley is
he there

  yes gobernor berkeley an hes at
marse carvers too

  dick swung around and walked out
through the door he was deathly weak
but he had shaken the grip of the fever from
his brain sufficiently to realize that he could
hang on only a little longer before the
veil again descended before what he
believed would be the end he must find
the governor

  he stumbled down the steps and turned
to the old familiar path through the pines
his feet seemed naturally to find their way
making each turn lifting themselves over
each root and stone a quarter of a league
and he stood before carver manor bril-
liantly lighted in every window from
the open door came a burst of laughter
staggering he crossed the lawn mounted
the steps entered the door

  a liveried servant barred his way dick
thrust him aside muttering - the gov-
ernor

  the servant ran for assistance and dick
walked down the hall to the door which
he knew opened into the dining-room
it was closed he lifted the latch half-fell

as it swung open he caught himself
stood stiffly erect and his eyes swept the
brilliant scene before him

  the great table was bright with dozens
of candles in their golden sticks with plate
china and glassware around it were more
than a score of people the cavalier aris-
tocracy of the colony the women with
gorgeous gowns direct from paris the men
equally resplendent in silks and laces vivid
colors and shining swords

  a woman glanced up at the door and
screamed the chatter and the laughter
ceased men sprang to their feet hands
instinctively falling to sword hilts

  colonel carver at the head of the table
took a step forward only to stare in amaze-
ment at the figure in the doorway before
him stood a tall man thin shaking with
the fever his skin deathly white beneath a
scraggly beard his buckskin garments caked
with mud a rusty musket trailing at his
side but with eyes that burned as bril-
liantly as a dozen candles and with a head
held high and proudly

  dick

  instantly all eyes turned from the
apparition in the doorway to the young
woman who had cried the name she had
risen from the table and stood staring
her beautiful face had become as pale as his
while in her eyes was both terror and disbelief

  dick she repeated unconsciously
dick jeffreys

  instantly the brilliancy of the staring eyes
was clouded dicks proudly held head
was lowered and a great overpowering
amazement impelled a step forward

  betsykins he whispered it is really
you betsykins

  as their eyes met dick forgot the fever
the misisepe berkeley the noose the
brilliant assemblage everything except this
incomprehensible transformation from boy-
ish comrade to wondrous alluring woman-
hood in the half-delirium of fever his
mind instantly comprehended each act of his
pas- and its consequences in the future
heedlessly prodigally to satisfy vagrant
trifling whims he had dissipated mans
greatest fortune with startling clearness
he recognized what that last interview be-
neath the sycamores had meant to her
how he had hurt her what he had now
brought upon himself

  betsykins he repeated in a low voice
one hand groping helplessly toward her

m


adventure

  in that moment dick jeffreys knew what
he desired more than anything else in the
world that for which no sacrifice was too
great it was not betsykins his playmate
but elizabeth his mate who stood there
before him but as he looked at her he
saw the gulf between them

  the thought maddened him what were
kings and empires and governors hatreds
what were purpose and high resolve and
duty before the demands of this over-
whelming love that he had always felt but
had never recognized and yet he had
fought his way back to stare through the
noose at this glory that might have been

  forgetting everything else completely
crushed the iron resistance that had kept
dick on his feet for the last few days began
to desert him his head fell forward his
eyes half-closed one hand groped for the
door-handle the candles began to swing
about his head

  jeffreys eh snarled a voice from the
table

  the hatred expressed in each syllable
the gloating inflection on the question at
the end stabbed through dicks wavering
consciousness brought his head up with a
snap an old man seated at the left of
colonel carver had risen to his feet and
as his eyes met dicks the young vir-
ginians vision cleared instantly

  the same your excellency he replied
steadily and clearly i am richard
jeffreys and i have the honor to report
that i have been far beyond the blue
mountains have reached the great water
of which we have heard i did not find
the red sea the gulf of california it is a
thousand leagues from here but i have
discovered a great river greater than any
river in europe and a land as large as two
europes a land more fair more fertile
than man has ever known i was the first
white man to see it to traverse it and i
claimed it in the name of the people of
england and their king charles the
second

chapter xvii

the discovery

gor a few moments after dick had
finished speaking there was not a word
not a movement about the big dining-table
since the founding of the colony seventy

years before there had been continual
speculation as to what lay beyond the
blue mountains from the spaniards had
come amazing tales they had traveled
far to the south and west even to the
eastern ocean they had found gold and
pearls rich nations strange lands

  but of what lay to the north of the
spanish country of what lay west of
virginia behind the blue mountains no
one knew

  now this fever-stricken wasted figure
had suddenly appeared before them and
had announced that not only had he been
farther than had any white man before him
but also that he had taken this land of
mystery in the name of the king of england

  it was sir william berkeleys eager voice
which first broke the silence

  you found gold precious stones pearls
for the king

  i found something more valuable than
gold answered dick a land which holds
greater riches and i found it for the people
of the king

  and you expect asked the governor
coldly that this will ransom your seditious
carcass that this will save you from the
noose you slipped

  i expect nothing and dicks voice
rang out proudly i found a land far
more fair far more fertile far more vast
than i have ever seen before and i took
it in the name of the people and the king of
england and because you are the kings
representative in virginia i have come to
you to report

  and do you think the king will balance
that against your evil tongue demanded
his excellency in a rage what does the
king want of more wilderness we cant
keep the savages out of what we have here
in virginia what is land worth when it is
so far away had you brought gold or
news of gold the king might have listened
to you there is gold there the span-
iards have found it

  you have not been beyond the blue
mountains sirrah you have hidden with
the thieving murdering savages in the foot-
hills and have come out with this wild tale
because you sickened of the life summon
a guard colonel carver this man goes to
the jamestown gaol

  there was a gasp of amazement from the
diners dicks manner of speaking his
burning eyes his simple words and his
before marquette



startling announcement had convinced
them all had won for him the allegiance
of every one except sir william

  you hold the right to say the gaol sir
answered dick i expected nothing else
from you byt i found this land i
traversed it for hundreds of leagues it
is a year last april since i first saw the
misisepe since then i have tried un-
ceasingly to return i would have been
here a year ago had i not been twice
captured by strange savages

  you may call this land worthless but
the french think otherwise they have
penetrated far but none so far as i have
gone their king was about to send a
priest and a representative to find the
great water and take it in his name
but i was first a tree is blazed with the
announcement of my discovery scorn it
if you will but the day will come when it
will be filled with the people of our race
when there will be great plantations towns
and cities when there will be a thriving
commerce on its waterways scorn it and
let the french have it the responsibility
will be yours

  to the gaol ordered sir william in a
fury i will listen to no more of this
i will not hear advice from an outlaw
take him away

  there was a scream from elizabeth
carver and she dropped into her chair
and buried her face in arms outflung among
the china and glassware since she had
first seen dick in the doorway had called
his name she had stood there looking at
him hoping praying that he had retrieved
himself

  as she sat there sobbing an old man
farther down the table his hair white his
face deeply lined staggered to his feet

  dick dick my boy my boy he
cried as he flung out an arm toward the
figure in the doorway

  you forget yourself captain jeffreys
snapped the governor yonder stands a
fugitive an outlaw a defamer of his
majesty he is no son of yours

  he is my son answered the father
hotly and i am proud to say it for he
stands there now proving himself a
man

  to the gaol with him shouted sir
william in a rage

  i beg your excellencys pardon a cool
low voice broke hi and immediately there

was silence while every eye was turned
toward the speaker

  he was a giant of a man his great head
with its high forehead wide-set eyes and
long black curls fittingly surmounting the
imposing bulk of him of all the men at
the table he alone had not risen had not
shared in the excitement caused by dicks
entrance and announcement

  big as he was there was nothing for-
midable in his appearance rather in his
strong gentle face in an expression of
mental power that made one forget his
physical size there was something that
instantly compelled confidence and as he
spoke even governor berkeley turned
deferentially

  there is nothing here in which you can
even interest yourself my lord said sir
william with a bow this young outlaw
after defying the king and his laws ran
away from the noose that he deserved and
now returns with this impossible story
with the expectation that it will save him
from the gallows the only importance
of this incident to you and to his majesty
will be the knowledge that we deal rigidly
with sedition in our colony

  i am sure your excellency the big
man replied calmly that his majesty is
sufficiently assured of your zeal it would
be more fitting the governor of so great a
colony if he employed his head a little more
than his heart

a gasp followed by a low murmur
broke from men and women alike
and sir william blushing furiously
again bowed low but remained silent

  the big man turned in his chair so that
he faced dick and for a moment he looked at
him curiously

  a chair for mister jeffreys he ordered
without taking his eyes from the ragged
figure of the young virginian

  no not there he said sharply as a
servant placed a chair behind dick here
beside me so now a glass of colonel
carvers good madeira quick simpleton
cant you see the man is ready to faint
dick staggered across to the table and
dropped into the chair

  your lordship began governor berke-
ley i pray you do not let yourself be
contaminated by this fellow

  dick glanced up angrily at sir william
  perhaps he said his excellency
io

adventure

would like to have me tell of our last in-
terview

  it was a chance shot for dick did not
believe that except for the two gaol
warders at the door any one in the colony
would ever have a suspicion as to the
manner of his escape from government
house

  your lordship the governor choked
there is only one place for this traitor the
gaol and tomorrow morning i promise you
he will swing from the gallows

  i dont doubt it in the least berkeley
replied the big man calmly but it is not
serving the king well to use his power to
settle a personal grudge and i have no
doubt but that you would snuff out the
chance for empire to save your dignity

  dick glanced at his lordship marveling
at the shrewdness of the man in so quickly
divining the true situation between himself
and the governor sir william pale with
-anger but silent retreated to his chair

  i might add continued the big man
that mister jeffreys has given tonight a
sample of the stuff of which empires are
made a glimpse of the courage and per-
severance which is the boast of england
and which gives his majesty pride in the
worth of the people he had been granted the
right to rule

  he turned to dick looked at him a
moment and then the rich lace of his cuff
falling upon the muddy torn buckskin
leggings laid a hand on the young mans
knee

  my boy he said i am lord cromp-
ton i am just arrived from his majestys
court am his majestys personal repre-
sentative sent to report upon conditions
in his colony of virginia anything you
may say lo me will be faithfully reported
to his majesty and i assure you that his
majesty is deeply interested in your story
first tell me where you have been what
you have seen and what you have done

  dick revived as much by the kindliness
and understanding of his lordship as by
the glass of wine recited briefly his experi-
ences since he had left virginia thirty
months before as he talked the very
thought of the wonderful country he had
found inspired him and when he had
finished the diners men and women had
gathered around him and were listening
intently

  your excellency said lord crompton

when dick had finished had you been
acquainted with the relations of the
jesuits as published in paris you would
recognize nothing except truth in what
mister jeffreys has said had you read
them you would marvel at the fortitude
of our young friend here would stand in
awe of what he has accomplished to me
it is an honor to know him and i hope that
he will give me his friendship

  he paused for a moment and looked at
dick

  my young friend he said at last i
wish i could be spared the words i must
speak now

  the circle drew closer elizabeth carver
who had pressed near with the others
stifled a cry

  i know his lordship continued that
as a brave man you will receive bravely
what i have to say

  he paused for a moment and then con-
tinued impressively

  you are too late the vast land you
have found has been lost to england not
through your own failure but through the
failure of the kings representatives in the
colonies had there been others like you
we would have been the fathers of empire
lost cried dick too late you
mean the jesuit marquette

  marquette and louis joliet emissary
of the king of france i was in paris the
first of the summer the city was aflame
with the news of what they had found
the land has already been claimed by the
french

  the date demanded dick what
was the date

  they reached the misisepe of which
you have told though marquette called it
the colbert about the middle of june last
year they went down the river a great
distance returned up another to what they
called lac mecheygan and thence to
montreal where joliet arrived in novem-
ber the news was immediately dispatched
to paris

  then we win shouted the young dis-
coverer we still win the tree opposite
the mouth of the ouisconsin stands there
now blazed with the date april  
that was two months before the french
arrived

  even so said lord crompton the
french still win i can not tell you or any
one here my reasons but england is not in a
before marquette



position at present to dispute the claims of
france

  but it is not right protested dick
it is not the land for the french they
are fur-getters not empire-builders every-
where they take from the land nowhere
do they put anything in it you can see
for yourself look at the st lawrence
where they have settlements there it is
the fur only the fur nothing is built for
the future this land that i have discov-
ered is for our people people who will care
for it as we have cared for virginia who will
year by year put in more than they take
out who will build up for those who will
come after not tear down

you have a vision my friend said lord
crompton but too far-sighted too im-
patient some day inevitably now no
then what i have done what i have
hoped for is for nothing

  by no means brave deeds are never
for naught nor such work as yours

  but dick did not hear the disappoint-
ment combined with the excitement and
the tension of the moment snapped the
slender thread by which he clung to con-
sciousness his body sagged in the chair
his head fell forward and he slipped to the
floor kind hands straightened out his
legs and arms but his head rested among
the parisian silks and laces of elizabeth
carvers gown

  dick dick she cried doctor and
she looked wildly around until she saw the
physician pushing through the crowd
tell me he wont die

 of course not my child was the
answer it is only the swamp fever the
fever piled upon the other load that bur-
dened him but he is strong first we
must get him to bed colonel carver

  i amlionored to have captain jeffreys son
in my house responded the colonel quickly

  strong arms bore him up the stairs
women crowded the door to be of service
and only governor berkeley remained below
with lord crompton

  your excellency said his lordship
may i not congratulate you upon the
estimable young men of your colony i am
sure his majesty will be delighted with my
relation of tonights affair

  sir william bowed low

  i am always at his majestys service
he murmured it is never my desire to
thwart his slightest wish

  i am sure of that berkeley and i am
sure that the king will have no cause to
disapprove of your actions in the future

dick opened his eyes the next
morning to find himself in a bed
for the first time in two and a half
years at first he believed he was alone
then he turned his head slightly and saw
his father sitting beside him

  better dick asked the old man
gently

  i am strong enough to stand on sir
williams gallows was the reply thats
about all i came back for it seems
instantly he realized that at the first
opportunity he had only driven his dagger
deeper into a torn heart

  forgive me father he cried im-
pulsively as he reached for the hand that
lay on the coverlet it seems that i am
destined to wound you to the very end
but i cant help it after seeing that land
to the west after striving for a year and a
half to return with the news of my dis-
covery there cant be much else than
bitterness in finding the fate of our people
rests in hands like those of berkeley
there is nothing to forgive my boy
answered the old cavalier gently in one
stroke you have wiped out whatever sorrow
your heedless youth may have brought to
me and there need be no fear of berkeley
we are beginning to see what he is what
his rule is doing for the colony we are
all loyal subjects of his majesty but we
are citizens of the colony of virginia and
right must rule here as it does in england
but the old devils claws are still un-
clipped protested dick

  they are pulled out by the roots so far
as you are concerned and captain jeffreys
face glowed with a pride of parenthood that
so long had been denied him lord
crompton rebuked the governor in the
presence of all the guests last night un-
mistakably gave sir william to understand
that he is to be held responsible to the king
for your safety

  he is the big man who talked to me
the same and a man with a heart and
a mind bigger than his great body the
king turned over the colony to two of his
favorites sold us out and there has been
such a stir that his lordship was dispatched
to settle the matter he is a favorite with
the king but he is a man and-
io

adventure

  he is a man interrupted dick eagerly
and if such as he can put up with the folly
of kings in the hope that something good
will come out of it for all of us i can do no
better than follow

  you will follow him my boy and again
the fathers pride lighted up his face he
sails for england in two weeks and he told
me last night that you are to go with him
are to tell his majesty in person what you
have found and then dick you are to
come back perhaps not to virginia but to
the colonies in this new world for there is
much to be done beyond the blue moun-
tains and you are to lead the work

  for a king

  dicks old resentment flashed for a
moment

  my boy as we grow older we leam
many things answered his father soberly
i begin to think of a king not as a divinely
empowered ruler of the people but as-

well-as-

  as a symbol of the government only
dick supplied

  exactly id hang for this if it were
known but it is so my boy and perhaps
you will live to see the time when kings
themselves are forced to admit it but
you are weak and there must not be more
strain sleep a while dick in a few days
i will take you home

  when dick wakened again it was to find
a cool hand stroking his forehead

  elizabeth he cried in amazement as
he turned

  for a moment he drank in her beauty
absorbing each detail of the whole that had
so staggered him the night before the
brown freckled skin of the romping child
had become clear ivory-tinted with rose
petals the straight boyish figure had
rounded swelling into the fulness of the
womanhood that had to dick so miracu-

lously come to her she blushed at the scru-
tiny but her eyes could not hide her happi-
ness

  elizabeth he whispered as he reached
for her hand betsykins what has hap-
pened to you oh what a fool i have been
my mad brain sent me off in search of
adventure and what i sought all the time
was here only now it is too late

  too late lord crompton humbled sir
william before you last night

  father has told me all that but i was
not even thinking of berkeley it is you
betsykins you are no longer the girl i last
saw under the sycamores by the river
that was not yesterday dick

  two years and a half

  he turned his head away

  two years and a half to achieve failure
he whispered bitterly

  not failure dick answered the girl
quickly did not your father tell you all
the plans

  betsykins you know what i mean
what is more dear to me now than all else
in the world blind fool that i was my
own boyish thoughtlessness lost it all for me
but tell meat least that you forgive and
forget that last night beneath the syca-
mores believe me that i did not know
what it was that i sought then

  dick dont you must be quiet
  but answer me betsykins

  there is nothing to forgive or forget
it is all in the past wiped out by the fact
that you havq come back to me back to
virginia you the man i always knew you
would be and the man i love

  she said it proudly arrogantly head held
high but only for a moment for dicks
arms drew her face down to his

  what have i done to deserve all this
he asked humbly antoine my nadouais-
sioux mother and now you
author of in the sawdust country and afraid of the bar

on the rude wall of the office
the battered clock boomed off the
remaining seconds at his desk
in the inner office potter sat
peering out through the window to the great
gray sawmill which stood a buzzing hive
of activity at the edge of the purple river
miss carleton in the outer office drummed
a rapid tattoo with the end of a pencil on
the glass top of her desk behind her
fenwick the bookkeeper was nervously
thumbing the pages of his ledger

  miss carleton glanced up at the clock
there were four minutes left her eyes
turned to the inner office through which she
could see the man who when the four min-
utes were gone must rise to meet adventure
in no mean proportions four minutes she
reflected yet he sat gazing casually out
through the narrow window

  as miss carleton studied the motionless
statue-like features of the man in the inner
office an expression of deep admiration
of fondness glimmered in her expressive
eyes behind her the clock continued to
toll off the seconds the tattoo of her pen-
cil ceased abruptly she rose and crossed
to where fenwick stood before his tall desk

  i think my nerves are about to snap
she whispered guardedly so that the sound
would not carry to the inner office she
nodded backward in the direction of the
open door i wish i could be as cool as
he

  fenwick middle-aged lean and pallid
turned amused eyes upon her

  cool he returned in a nasal whisper
and why shouldnt he be id like to
know

  miss carletons brows contracted

  with harrigan and his gang to face
tonight

  fenwick giggled with huge delight

  him face harrigan why he hasnt
got the nerve

  miss carletons eyes flashed in quick
loyalty

  thats not true she responded stoutly
when the report came in this morning that
harrigan had raided our log rafts mr
potter said that tonight would end harri-
gans career on suicide river mr potter
is waiting for the shutting-down whistle
now

  fenwick nodded readily

  yes he said that but he had a long talk
no

adventure

with sheriff dunn afterward hes not
going up-stream after harrigan hes
sending the sheriff and his posse to do it for
him

  miss carleton drew back with a quick
intake of breath

  why-why the sheriff and harrigan
work hand in glove the sheriff is on
harrigans pay-roll

  the bookkeeper drew the green eye-shade
from his forehead with an emphatic snap

  potters sending him because he hasnt
got the nerve himself hes afraid to set-
tle his own scores if he was half a man hed
take a posse of the mill boys and round up
harrigan tonight but instead he sends
dunn

  miss carletons sensitive lips quivered
she cast an uncertain glance over her shoul-
der toward the open door of the inner office

  you-you must be mistaken she said
indignantly mr potter is-is a man
hed not go to sheriff-

  she stopped the whistle of the great
gray sawmill beyond the office shrilled its
six-oclock bellow the screech of the saws
died gradually to a low whine then ceased
altogether the planers relinquished their
chattering discourse the cough of the
driving engine stopped silence crept over
the little sawdust community

  miss carleton turned about and swept
another glance at the open door im-
im sure you are mistaken mr fenwick
i know that mr potter wouldnt-

  a peremptory summons from the electric
buzzer above her desk interrupted a mo-
ment later she stepped through the open
door and stood across the wide desk facing
potter

  im afraid miss carleton he said
gathering up the papers on the desk that
ill have to ask you to stay later tonight
ill have a report or two to dictate a bit
later and another thing miss carleton
when sheriff dunn arrives have him come
in immediately tonight he and his posse
are going up to the south fork after
harrigan

miss carletons fingers tight-
ened spasmodically on the edge of
the wide desk from outside the
office came the loud tramping of many feet
as the mill crew passed on their way to the
mess-house an instant later fenwick
slammed the outer door

  youre-youre not going up after
harrigan yourself

  potter glanced quickly up from the papers
on the desk

  the sheriff will attend to that thats
what the county pays him for miss
carleton

  her tanned cheeks flushed deeply on
the surface of the desk her finger-tips beat
an erratic tattoo

  the sheriff is going to do it for you
potter rose to his feet and stood facing
her across the desk his gaze rested in-
terrogatively on her evident agitation

  surely the sheriff thats his job miss
carleton

  an expression of wistfulness and of dis-
appointment came upon her face

  then its true youre afraid

  potter smiled tolerantly

  my dear miss carleton youve excited
yourself over something

  im-im afraid you dont understand
she murmured hesitated fora brief moment
then swepthonestly on youve only been
in these woods a short while but i was
bom and raised here and the traditions
are-are part of me here in the sawdust
country a man fights his own battles he
doesnt ask outside help and youre
sending the sheriff to fight yours we-
we call that cowardice

  potters leftn youngish face bore honest
concern

  but miss carleton im a busy man and

have many things-

  her ups quivered

  youre-youre afraid

  you do not understand he began but
did not complete the thought miss carle-
ton drew herself erfect in sudden dignity
she halted the drumming of her fingers
the abrupt cessation of their emphatic
tattoo was in itself an emphasis

  then all they say is true you are
afraid and you make this an excuse the
sheriff why-why he is as dishonest as
the man you are sending him after hes

in the employ of that very-

  the street door opened and closed miss
carleton turned about in the outer office
awkwardly twirling his hat in his hands
stood sheriff dunn

  she whirled quickly back to face potter
tears of indignation glistened on her round-
ing cheeks

  youre afraid-a coward she sobbed

st
up-stream

in

hysterically and brushing aside the tears
she drew herself erect and sped through the
open door to her desk in the outer office

  at potters nod the sheriff entered and
took his position across the desk potters
face a bit flushed was as expressionless
as a piece of sculpture

  well dunn are you ready how many
men did you get

  the sheriff shifted the weight of his body
to one foot and cleared his throat apolo-
getically

  im afraid i cant do anything for you
mr potter it would be a wild-goose
chase

  potters brows lowered

  cant do anything what do you mean
dunn

  well ive had the matter investigated
and come to the conclusion that your logs
wasnt stole last night the boom-sticks
must have parted and the logs drifted over
the bar to sea before daylight
investigated who investigated
jackson did this morning

  jackson why that man is-

  he is my deputy-sheriff mr potter
a deputy why dunn every one
knows his connection with harrigan
dunns face flushed

  youre wrong mr potter i advise you
to drop the matter i dont want to have
no trouble with you

  you dont by- so thats the way

the things stand you dont so all these
whisperings about you and harrigan are
correct youre another of harrigans
jackanapeses

  the sheriff leaned across the desk

  i warn you mr potter them words-

  potter rose to his feet when he spoke
again his voice was low-pitched and firm
with restraint

  get out of here quick dunn ill get
my own posse to get harrigan

  dunn wavered a moment then stepped
to the door

  as i said before mr potter i advise you
to drop it you cant get no posse in this
town tonight my deputy mr jackson
just took the whole crew down to danville
in his launch hes giving em a dance down
there you may find one or two boys still
in town-but i advise you to forget it
the outer door slammed sharply behind
the sheriff the boom of the battered clock
sounded again through the room

  potter turned his gaze to the window
darkness was fast settling down over the
gray mill he swung about and jerked open
a drawer in the desk taking up an auto-
matic he dropped it into his pocket
squirmed into a heavy red mackinaw and
took up his hat

  that will be all for tonight miss carle-
ton in the morning we will make the re-
port-if there is one to make

  through the broad front windows she
watched him go closing the door behind
him he made off in the direction of the mill
wharf he passed the bunk-house without
so much as a glance and continued toward
the rivers edge miss carleton sprang to
her feet he was going without a posse

  hes going alone no no theyll kill
him its-its my fault i taunted him
i said he was-

  she sprang toward the door but half-
way her knees ceased to support her body
and a moment later the void unconscious-
ness descended upon her

when darkness had settled over
the surface of the river potter spun
the fly-wheel of the launch motor
and a moment later at low speed piloted
the light craft from among the piling of the
mill wharf out upon the breast of the moon-
lit river

  a heavy tide was running whichtogether
with the natural current of the river forced
him to increase the speed of the motor in
order to make way against it for a time
he held steadily toward the open water
then as the middle of the river was reached
he threw over the tiller and the launchs
nose swung about and headed up-stream

  it was fully five minutes before the craft
gathered full speed against the force of the
rushing waters the dim shore-line on
either side of him swept by like a moving
picture overhead the stars twinkled
faintly dimmed by the light haze which
hung over the river a vague wraith of
a moon stuck its thin spindle points into
the gray sky

  he did not underestimate the difficulties
of the task before him he was acquainted
with harrigan and with harrigans methods
this river pirate was one of the most daring
characters in all the sawdust land ruth-
less treacherous resourceful he was sur-
rounded by a crew of his own choosing
potters eyes glittered with anticipation


adventure

and he advanced the throttle of the
motor	

  as he rounded a big bend in the river a
brisk breeze drove down upon him from the
deep mouth of the river valley beyond
settling himself at the tiller he rolled and
lighted a cigaret and busied himself not-
ing the landmarks as they swept by

  as the launch breasted the mouth of the
south fork potter threw over the tiller
again and ran the craft into the narrow
tributary here it was far darker than on
the main arm of water the trees on either
bank mingling their foliage to shut out the
dim moon and stars

  at a quarter of a mile from the mouth of
the fork potter reduced the launchs
speed and directed the craft in among the
heavy undergrowth of the right bank
then he sprang ashore making fast to the
heavy bough of a fallen forest giant

  he scrambled quickly up the bank and
reaching the flat above paused a moment
to take his bearings then without hesi-
tation he pushed ahead in the general di-
rection of harrigans camp

  the slight mist of the early evening was
disappearing and the sky and stars seemed
to have grown inestimably closer to earth
he was grateful for this meager light the
way underfoot was heavily overgrown and
cluttered with dead brush and the limbs and
trunks of fallen trees

  he halted suddenly clutching the auto-
matic in his pocket until the edges of steel
stung the flesh of his hand a dark shadow
moved ahead of him and without hesita-
tion he dropped flat on the ground crouch-
ing low he watched the dim figure walking
back and forth across the moonlit trail

  flat as possible on the ground potter
crawled at right angles to his original di-
rection guarded by this shadowy figure
which he knew must be one of harrigans
pickets it was slow tedious work the
twigs and branches which covered the
ground were dry and brittle making great
the chances of discovery

  after perhaps ten minutes he reached a
wooded spot and rose gratefully to his feet
he had not been detected the sentry
still warmed himself by treading back and
forth across the mouth of the trail

  smiling to himself potter turned about
and started by the roundabout passage in
the direction of harrigans rendezvous
this way although longer and more dif-

ficult to traverse presented far less chances
of discovery

  he made his way slowly and cautiously
once or twice the darkness confused him
and he was forced to strike a match in order
to take up the dim trail the flare of the
match he carefully concealed within his
cupped hands exposing the light in but one
direction at a time

  at perhaps half a mile from the spot at
which he had taken the wooded trail potter
discovered at some distance a dim glow
in these deserted woods it could have but
one meaning he knew that it was from
harrigans fire and when he went ahead
again it was with decreased speed and in-
creased caution

  at every yard the glow increased and
when the flames became visible between the
tree trunks potter chose his footings with
wearying exactness he reached the edge
of the clearing without sound and concealed
himself behind a huge fir

  a small fire blazed in the center of the
cleared space at a short distance stood a
large pail of drinking water and many rolls
of blankets about the fire sprawled in
various poses of relaxation were half a dozen
woodsmen some dozing some conversing
guardedly in whispers

   closer to the fire carefully apart from the
others sat two men in close consultation
one of them held up a sheet of paper to the
firelight unlike the others they did not
whisper and their conversation reached
potters straining ears

  the smaller of these potter recognized
as harrigan he was a wizened little man
of perhaps forty years sinewy of build cat-
like of movement and bronzed to the color
of old copper by the river suns he was
reading to the other the figures from the
sheet of paper the listener a larger man
was quite unknown to potter

  the stranger took the paper from har-
rigans hand and holding it up to the light
of the fire scanned the figures it bore

  that scale was made of the logs today
harrigan was saying look her over and
make us an offer you neednt be afraid
of trouble with potter hes got no nerve
well attend to the brands on the logs and
also to gettin them down to your customers
booms so let your figure be big enough to
cover such incidentals

  the stranger busied himself with a study
of the sheet
up-stream



  a fine flock of logs harrigan pursued
conversationally and apparently without
intention of helping out the sale indeed
he seemed utterly indifferent as to whether
or not the other purchased his plunder
youll find them mostly clears benson
potter was bringing them down to his mill
to fill a big order for uppers

  potters sense of the dramatic told him
that his moment to make an effective en-
trance had come despite his iron control
his breath caught once with an eager gasp
his hand on the automatic inside the mack-
inaw pocket he stepped briskly into the
circle of firelight

  yes he said evenly grinning to the
startled harrigan and potters going to
take em down to fill that order

  panic took the place of the camps drowsy
calm every one sprang to his feet so
startling had been potters appearance that
as he approached the men involuntarily
retreated to the opposite side of the fire
across the low flame they glared at him
from frowning startled eyes

  doubtless the more imaginative of these
hardened woodsmen had thought at the
moment of his appearance that a forest
ghost was come to pay them a visit potter
gave little heed to them however concen-
trating his attention upon the quick tiger-
like movements of harrigan whose small
bead-like eyes were fixed on the bulge of
potters pocket where the muzzle of the
automatic was pressed

  in all fairness i must warn you harri-
gan potter remarked at the first sign of
activity on the little mans part that im
not alone there is a man with a gun be-
hind ever tree about this clearing this
community has stood for your raids as long
as possible im in dead earnest harrigan
and youll be obliging yourself more than
me by just taking things easy

  harrigan a sudden surprise dawning in
his eyes turned a quick nervous glance
about the dark rim of firs which surrounded
them for a moment he seemed to cower
before their dark sinister silence but pres-
ently his eyes became defiant again and
he turned back to potter

  what is it you want potter he asked
easily

  potter laughed with genuine amuse-
ment

  isnt that question rather unnecessary
he returned



  harrigan stared blankly across the smold-
ering fire

  possibly potter continued you can
get away with that on the sheriff but i
think we understand each other harrigan

  the little man shrugged his shoulders
the others sullen and silent grouped
themselves about their leader

  what is it you want potter harrigan
repeated mechanically

  potter glanced amusedly about from one
to another

  with so many rare birds the selection
is rather difficult but i guess youll do
harrigan i want you

  the little man grinned

  just me

  you and that sheet of paper potter
returned good-humoredly the combina-
tion is beautiful it cinches you nicely
even your man the sheriff can not ask for
more evidence

  harrigans eyebrows raised

  the sheriff my man im not ac-
quainted with the gentleman potter

  nevertheless i imagine he is well ac-
quainted with your money

  harrigan grinned and dropped into his
pocket the sheet of paper which bore the
scale of the stolen logs

  so he murmured after a moments
pause so you want me eh he
glanced keenly into potters face

  exactly potter nodded

  for a moment harrigans eyes dropped to
the ground at potters feet suddenly he
glanced up his eyes cold as steel his full-
lipped mouth mocking

  well what are you going to do about it
potter

  id really not advise you to start any-
thing harrigan he said smiling how-
ever that is your own lookout ive given
orders to my men to pick you off first-at
the first movement

  harrigan nodded indifferently potter
paused a moment baffled by the mans self-
assurance he wondered if harrigan were
as certain as he seemed that he held the high
hand in the situation

  youve raided my booms three times
harrigan he went on finally on each
occasion you half-killed the man who was
employed as watchman the man you
got last night is right now fighting for
his life at the camp hospital and his
chances are slim he is a pal of the boys
ii

adventure

ive brought with me theyll not hesitate
to pick you off

harrigan grinned his right
hand slid along his belt toward the
butt of a revolver which obtruded
from a large canvas holster of the group
across the fire he was the only one visibly
armed the others kept their hands at
their sides but their eyes were full of the
activities of their chief

  harrigans hand continued along the
belt and came to a stop on the butt of the
revolver

  they tell me you used to be a cowboy
potter laughed think you can draw fast
enough for those boys out there

  harrigan grinned back good-naturedly
in another moment his beady eyes nar-
rowed menacingly

  now potter youve had your little say
and finished its my turn heres mine
potter

  without removing the revolver from its
holster he fired twice downward into the
ground

  now mr potter youd better go ahead
and take what you want but youll have
to be quick in less than a minute there
will be enough of my men around this
camp to pick the bones of you and your
gang its your say potter now come

  a vast doubt rose in potter then as to the
success of his carefully planned ruse he
removed the automatic from his pocket
and directed it frankly across the fire

  dont move he snapped and retreating
a single step stood beside the large pail of
drinking water considering this new phase
of his adventure although not one of
them moved a general grin spread over the
faces of the group he held at bay

  harrigan was grinning mockingly across
at him a moment passed then another

  a loud tramping of underbrush sounded
steadily growing nearer a moment later
six men panting breathlessly burst into the
clearing

  whats the signal for boss the fore-
most of them asked as he caught his breath

  potter laughed outright and with the
muzzle of the automatic motioned them
across the fire

  over there with the rest he ordered
he turned quickly and called back over his
shoulder to his fantom reenforcements-

  watch em close boys

  a vague concealed smile sparkled in his
eyes at this new turn of affairs he swung
back to face harrigan

  you come with me quietly harrigan
ive had enough of your bluffing now i
mean business youre the only one i
want just now my boys will stand guard
over this fine crew of yours until ive got
you safely away if one of em moves
so much as a hair my men out there wont
spare him

  harrigan his face purple with rage
turned viciously on the men who had come
in answer to his signal

  you fools-you fools why didnt you
stay outside the clearing theyve got us
surrounded and-and you walk right in
too

  an expression of vast astonishment which
quickly changed to sheepishness spread
over the faces of the newcomers

  potter laughed heartily he motioned
to harrigan with the automatic

  well harrigan come along no time
to- 

  he hesitated abruptly a moment later
he swung his gaze to the dark rim of firs
which circled the clearing a sudden alert-
ness was evidenced by the carriage of his
head

  the new sound drew every eye two
minutes passed a seventh man stepped
into the light of the clearing

  harrigan his eyes bulging strangled his
rage with effort

  my god you too

  the other grinned appreciatively

  wait a minute boss dont heat your
collar i just overheard what you said
to these guys and i had a look-around
there aint a soul in these woods but whats
right here

  harrigans wizened face was a study of
transformation from one violent emotion
to its direct opposite a vast delight
kindled in his eyes he turned upon potter
with a roar

  a stall wellill be crucified potter
youre good

  the hard lines of the little mans face eased
to a great laugh as his laughter ended
his eyes became beady and small again
and his mouth twitched at the corners

  well potter he snapped defiantly ad-
vancing a step why dont you take
what you want

  he advanced still another step
up-stream



  i call your little bluff potter now
come

  potter came

  stooping he caught up the pail of drink-
ing water which stood close by and dashed
its contents over the neglected fire with
a hiss and a puff of steam the flames were
blotted out the sudden extinguishing of
the glare which had been in their eyes mo-
mentarily blinded the group in this
moment of darkness deepened by the over-
hanging foliage which shut out almost com-
pletely the dim light of the stars potter
sprang forward

  his spring carried him straight to harri-
gan who was now several paces in advance
of his men with the butt of his automatic
he rapped the little man gently but with
deft accuracy on the head and as the other
slumped into a limp heap and before the
rest had regained their wits picked up the
light burden and carried it swiftly toward
the wall of dark firs which surrounded them

  gaining the seclusion of the forest he
secured a fresh hold on the limp form of
harrigan and swung him across his shoulder
like a slain deer then he started swiftly
down the wooded trail toward the river
behind him he heard the thud of bodies as
the others scrambled about in the darkness
searching for him

  hoarse cries arose orders were bawled by
some lieutenant of the man on his shoulder
a rush of footsteps came along the trail
other and dimmer sounds came from the op-
posite direction where potter surmised
half of the crew were following the other
trail

  stepping behind a large fir trunk he slid
his burden to the ground and propped it
against the tree he secured the hands
and feet with leather thongs from his pocket
and placed a gag fashioned from his hand-
kerchief over the mouth

  all about him now arose the calls and
curses of the men beating about in search
of him with studied caution potter stole
from tree to tree the limp form of harrigan
drooping over his shoulder and when
the chase had passed far beyond him he re-
turned to the trail and thereafter his pas-
sage to the fork of the river was surer and
swifter

  half-way harrigan regained full con-
sciousness potter set him down and tight-
ened the thongs and the mouth gag on his
shoulder again the little man squirmed

viciously but potter merely put a turning
pressure on the thong-bound wrists and the
struggling was given over to sullen sub-
mission

  down the perilously steep bank he carried
his captive and dumped him unceremoni-
ously into the bottom of the launch then
he whirled the fly-wheel cast off the light
painter from the bough and sped down the
narrow arm of water toward the open river
as the nose of the launch swung on to the
rivers breast the first dim rays of the im-
pending dawn appeared in the east far
above the tips of the towering firs

  sitting in the stern sheets potter rolled a
cigaret and when it was alight settled him-
self comfortably by the tiller and guided
the craft in the direction of the mill wharf
in the town below

  as he sped down-stream his mind crept
back over the events of the night and when
he remembered that a certain girl-just the
sort of girl he had dreamed about back
in those college days of his in far-away
san francisco-had called him afraid he
laughed softly confidently contentedly

in the little back room of the mill
office potter sat guard over his
prisoner harrigan the thongs at
his wrists and ankles loosened and the gag
removed lay sleeping fitfully in the bunk
in his shirt sleeves puffing at his pipe
potter sat close by

  he was roused suddenly from his revery
by the sound of light rapid footsteps ap-
proaching along the board-walk which ran
in front of the office building when the
footsteps halted a key was fitted into the
lock of the office-door and some one entered

  a faint nervous tapping sounded on the
door of the back room potter rose and
tightened the thongs of his prisoner a light
hand tried the knob of the door and finding
it locked the owner of the hand retreated
across the office floor

  potter slipped quickly into his mackinaw
unlocked the door and stepped into the
presence of miss carleton she stood
poised uncertainly in the center of the room

  her eyes grew wide with relief as she saw
him she ran quickly to him

  oh im glad-glad you didnt go

  she was swaying wearily there before
him and he put his arm about her slim
shoulder to steady her

  i havent been able to sleep all night
n

adventure

she murmured weak ive just paced
back and forth the floor of my room until-
until i know every inch of the carpet

  a light sobbing interrupted she glanced
up at him then from between damp un-
steady lashes

  i was afraid you were hurt by what i said
last night i was very much afraid you
had gone up-stream after harrigan and
theyd killed you mr jim oh im glad
you didnt go

  potter smiled reassuringly

  perhaps miss carleton what you said
is true

  she shook her head vehemently

no no they would have killed you
surely it would have been so utterly fool-
hardy youre not a coward mr jim
potters arm tightened on her shoulder

  i am very much a coward helene he
said softly there are many things id
like to say to you now but im not brave

 enough and there is another thing im
 quite afraid of i wonder if you would
 summon the sheriff for me

 miss carletons eyes were startled

 the sheriff

 i believe the sum total of the sheriffs
 objections to going after harrigan last night
 was lack of evidence ive got some for him
 miss carletons breath caught

 you mean that you went up-stream-
 up-stream alone

he nodded toward the back room
helene carleton turned frightened eyes
toward the open door

 you will get the sheriff for me helene
 im afraid to go for him myself

 she drew herself back from him with
 indignation

 afraid she echoed

 you see ive got harrigan himself in
 there potter chuckled and im very
 much afraid helene to leave liim alone

the babu and the black buck

             by louis esson

   t was at a wayside station in north-
   ern india

      the station-master an officious and
 voluble bengali was in a state of great
 excitement lady bertram had arrived
 she was the aristocratic wife of the great
 lord reginald bertram a high magistrate
 noted for his love of sport

   she presented a telegram the babu
 salaamed

   i have it safe my lady it was left at
 this station in my charge to be delivered
 on inquiry the cartage is thirty-eight
 rupees

   impossible replied the lady i wont
 pay thirty-eight rupees

   it is a corpse replied the babu
 gravely and corpses are very expensive
 indeed i assure you

    where is it she asked at last

   impressed by his own importance the
 bengali opened an inner door

   the corpse he said proudly

   lady bertram sniffed and retired

    i refuse to take delivery she cried and

then walked away haughtily to her carriage
with her nose in the air

  i called the station-master

  what have you got there

  its lord bertrams corpse he said
great scott and lady bertram has
refused to accept delivery of it

  what was this tragedy this oriental
mystery i went into the office but soon
came out again a huge black buck was
lying there a wonderful beast but in
rather high condition so this was lord
bertrams corpse it seems the noble lord
had gone hunting shot the animal in the
forest and sent it along as a present to lady
bertram but the train was slow the
weather was hot and the native official
had confused various regulations

to do about it

  the babu again looked up the regula-
tions the case was perfectly clear

  it shall be kept he replied for three
months and then fonvarded to delhi to be

novelette

fenyon was a brave man on
 j that point there were no two
opinions in the battalion and
 jm the more terrible and hideous
his surroundings the hotter the fight in
which he found himself the more resolute
and clear-thinking he became his men
regarded him with a kind of awe an awe
not unmixed with a certain grim amuse-
ment and since he showed no particular
desire to preserve his own life yet never
asked that they should take risks that
were not wanted they followed him
doggedly they bore him no real love
however he was too cold too unapproach-
able but he exacted respect by reason
of his qualities in action his courage his
dash and his leadership

  to kenyon himself failure in anything
he had ever undertaken was inconceivable
pride alone would have made him a success
in war for it was pride in his own destiny

that carried him triumphantly through
fights which others more prudent would
have avoided it was pride in his own
powers and nothing else that kept him
going long after another man would have
given in it was pride of race that forced
him to become a soldier when all his
instincts craved for peace

  his company sergeant-major no mean
judge of character summed him up more
or less accurately

  a foine orficer the foinest ever i seen
in all france but faith-the army dont
come nachral to him at all at all hes
no more likin for the trinches or for going

over the top than the rist of us hes-

proud all the same so proud hed be dyin
for shames sake rather than give any wan
cause to think that he hated the war but
i know its thrue im afther watchin
him many a time when he never knew i
was by you could see in his eyes what


ii

adventure

he was thinkin of deep in his heart im

not blamin him aythur tis a-of a

war this an well we know it

  as a civilian kenyon had been entirely
wrapped up in his work which was litera-
ture and his hobby which was old china
he was a dreamer with high ideals and
expensive tastes vast wealth inherited
from an uncle had freed him from all
necessity of earning a living hence he had
been able to devote his time and talents
to writing

  he had published two books on social
evolution and economics three slim calf-
bound volumes of verse and a history of old
english chinaware all of which were
highly praised by the press and neglected
by the reading and book-buying public

  although thirty-five years of age when war
broke out kenyon regarded it as his duty
to join the army and so aid his fellow-country
men in their task of defeating the germans

  he announced his intention one morning
after breakfast

  his wife younger than her husband by
some ten years listened to his patriotic
outburst in somewhat troubled silence

  well he said and waited the approval
which he knew must as usual follow

  there are many men younger than you
was all the comment she made

  and am i to stand back he flared
until every man younger than myself
every shirker in the kingdom makes up his
mind am i not fit and strong any one
would think i were an old man wounded
by the composure with which she had
greeted his momentous decision he gave
her once more the benefit of his views
it is my duty to join that should be
quite sufficient what is a mans duty to
his country but to fight when needed
do i owe less of that duty than my neigh-
bor who has lived for six fewer years than
myself am i to let others pay my debts
my god doris i cant do it

  but alan how do you know youll ever
make a soldier

  she spoke timidly knowing full well the
effect of any opposition to her husbands
wishes

  not make a soldier

  he gazed at her with an expression of
offended dignity had she his wife alfer
three years of association with him so small
an opinion of his intelligence did she
doubt his courage

  why not he said surely doris im
as brave as most men

  the pain genuine pain in his voice cut
her to the quick

  dear i didnt mean that i knowyoull
be brave of course i was thinking of
your-your temperament

  after that she did not speak for some
time did he realize-he was dense in
many ways was alan-did he realize what
his departure would mean to her she
wondered he would go away out of her
life light-heartedly she knew perhaps
never to return had he no duty to her
to his wife

  you havent considered my point of
view alan have you youre a married
man there are others who are not
married who have not yet joined

  a stubborn look had come into his thin
rather ascetic face his lips were pressed
tightly together while she was speaking

  doris he said its the same for both
of us you ought to be glad you have a
husband to send to the army it is your
duty to let me go thank heaven i can
leave you provided for it cant be for
long were bound to smash them
with a small army such as weve got
said the wife

  wait till the men who are joining up
now reinforce them said the husband
grandly i dont want to fight god
knows but its my duty i think i can
give a good account of myself i know i
can courage is merely a question of in-
telligent application of a rule to lead
men in battle demands duty honor and
above all pride

  he met her gaze challenging a denial
she said nothing words were useless
now she knew she understood only too
well his meaning pride what else was
it but pride that was taking him from her
for prides sake he would cut himself adrift
pride would force him to do what others
had done or die in the attempt pride set
the standard by which he ruled his actions

  what one man can do i can he said
he patted her on the shoulder be brave
old girl you must youre going to be a
soldiers wife and i wont disgrace you
youll be proud of me i know

  he was certain that what he said would
come true he would give her good cause
for pride the intoxication of war that
comes to those who have never seen war
in the dug-out



the spirit of the crusader was uppermost
in his consciousness that his wife had
tears in her eyes was a vexation but she
was a woman and to a woman tears were
natural nevertheless he hated scenes
any display of emotion was undignified

  there there he said you mustnt
fret sweetheart its part of the sacri-
fice-

  he stared blindly out of the open window
at the meadows and woods and distant hills
bathed in mellow sunshine and saw himself
an officer at the head of his men fighting
against odds doing gallant deeds winning
fame and admiration

  a wonderful brilliantly colored picture

  doris would be proud of him even if
he were to fall in battle it would be fine

  and so kenyon was prepared for death
from the moment he set foot on the cobbles
of le havre moreover from his point of
view it were more fitting to die bravely in
the open than save his life by hiding in some
trench or dug-out death in other words
before dishonor he lived up to the ideal
he had in mind and gained much credit

  and then during the somme push after
more than fourteen months of fighting-

       every man however brave has
r  some especial form of weakness

        kenyons weakness as revealed in
a front-line trench one summer evening
was peculiar but unimportant strangely
enough however it did far more toward
earning him the liking of his men than
had all his courage his weakness showed
that he was after all human

  kenyon was thorough in whatever he
undertook so having become a soldier
through a sense of duty and knowing the
inevitable risks of his calling he must needs
prove his sincerity by displaying an almost
reckless contempt for danger

  it was this quixotic folly that led him
to make his way by himself through an
enemy barrage to some men of another
company cut off in a captured trench

  youll never do it he was told its
madness to try

  kenyon laughed and ran forward through
the shells that burst on every side of him
with great spurts of flame and dense
columns of black smoke and earth and
stones flung skyward

  those whom he had left behind wailed
to see him fall but the impossible happens

in war and kenyon reached his men
organized an effective defense beat off an
attack and led the survivors back when it
became dark

  the colonel thanked him

  i dont know kenyon when ive seen
a braver or more dashing deed ill draw
the brigadiers attention to what youve
done and tell him what i think you deserve
kenyon was pleased but he shook his
head

  that was nothing sir absolutely noth-
ing at all i can assure you that any one
else would have done the same as i did i
was lucky enough to be given the oppor-
tunity thats all

  this was no pose kenyon believed
what he said having as high a faith in his
brother-officers as he had in himself

  it was on the evening after this exploit
that he revealed to an interested gathering
his own weakness

  he stood in a firebay talking to the
battalion bombing officer ohara by name
a mere boy in years but a veteran in expe-
rience and in a measure kenyons model

  ohara had by his own deeds set a stand-
ard of courage that was high that he him-
self would reach that standard had been
from the very first kenyons aim and to
ohara indeed to his decision and cool-
ness he owed his life for ohara had gone
out into no mans land under machine
gun fire and rescued him from the german
wire where he lay helpless

  got over your excitement of yesterday
asked ohara pretty hot shop that-eh
kenyon smiled

oh yes pretty hot while it lasted
best thing i ever saw continued
ohara i dunno how on earth you got
through kenyon by jove i wouldnt
have tried it myself for a fortune

  no man in his heart of hearts dislikes
praise

the color mounted into kenyons cheeks
you say that of course but youve
done things every bit as good-better i
wouldnt be here now but for you ohara
and you know it

  ohara laughed and looked at kenyon
with his head on one side as though con-
sidering him in a fresh light

  lord that was nothing

  wasnt it said kenyon i know it
was id given up all hope of ever getting
away anyhow


adventure

  rot said ohara it was pitch
dark and i knew pretty well whereabouts
you were all i had to do was to find you
cut the wire where you were caught and
help you in

  kenyon nodded slowly

  yes quite so but theres more than
one way of telling the story dont forget
that you carried me in i couldnt walk
for about a week afterward i might be
hanging on that wire now

  rot said ohara once more youre
such a queer old beggar kenyon youll
talk by the hour of what other fellows do
but when any one tries to point out that
youve done about a hundred times as much
as the rest of us put together you get quite
upset by it

  there came a sudden shout from the other
end of the firebay

  luk at that will ye take that ye
brute

  kenyon turned sharply to see a rat-hunt
in progress

  rats those few that had crossed his path
in peace time had always sickened him
but the trench-rats scavengers bred by war
as foul as the jackals or vultures of warmer
climes filled him with loathing

  their size their savage daring their
cunning their contempt for man marked
them as vermin to be avoided yet how
could one avoid creatures that swarmed
in trench and dug-out that more familiar
than the dogs of the house of dives stole
the food from the very table that crawled
over one in the brief hours of sleep that
were met with-most horrible of all wars
horrors-in no mans land among the
poor dead that lay month after month
awaiting burial

  to kenyon the rats were a torment
harder to endure than shell-fire or bullets
yet a rat-hunt with its almost inevitable
killing made him nervous

  so now he shivered forced a smile and
ignoring ohara moved away hoping to
be out of hearing before the brute met its
death

  ogrady a lance-corporal in his company
aimed a blow with the butt of his rifle as
the rat fled along the fire-step the blow
missed and the animal twisting around
raced back

  kill it sullivan shouted ogrady

  out of the way terence mind yer-
selfl

sullivan jabbed with his bayonet shout-
ing with laughter another hit out with
an entrenching tool the rat driven into
a corner made a sudden spring at kenyon
oh my god

  a cold terror seized him he could feel
the beast clinging to his sleeve trying to
clamber up to his shoulder

take it off his voice broke sharply
take it off for gods sake some one
he shook his arm wildly frantic with fear
and the rat was flung against the sandbags

  sullivan still laughing brought his butt
down hard on the creatures head spattering
brains and blood on the duckboard

  kenyon fought down a desire to be sick
all his strength seemed to have left him
he knew that his face was white and that
he was shivering all over but the rat was
dead and harmless and he did not care

  lord he laughed and spoke in a tone
of voice which even to himself sounded
blustering and forced

  i cant bear the sight of those things
i never could i thought the brute had
bitten me

  oharas eyes twinkled

  kenyon im agreeably surprised in
fact im delighted

  how said kenyon i dont under-
stand

  it restores my sense of self-respect to
know that theres one thing at least that
you fight shy of

  but kenyon hesitated wondering if
ohara were laughing at him or not but

ohara you dont expect - it you

dont expect me to make pets of the-

things

  no of course not i loathe rats myself
what makes me so glad is the thought that
youre a human being with limitations the
same as the rest of us

  kenyon grunted

  id rather go over the top any day than
have one of those beasts touch me

  and ohara knowing what kenyon had
done under fire knew that he meant what
he said but ohara was not the only one
to notice kenyons lapse into fear

  the men saw and chuckled

  that bangs banagher said ogrady
an him afther marchin as cool as ye
plaze through a barrage o five-nines
without turnin a hair of his head

  we have found him out at lasht said
sullivan  tis the rats that has him
in the dug-out



scairt faith i know now hes flesh an
blood same as the rist of us

 an not a-mechanical conthrivance

for killin germans said another by
dam i had to laugh at him

  but the shame of his encounter with the
rat remained with kenyon for days his
pride had been humbled even his own
men who should look up to him as one
without fear or without reproach must
have seen his terror not even the news
that he would in all probability gain a much
coveted decoration as a recognition of his
daring when he went through the barrage
could comfort him

  he had faced the most terrible of dangers
unmoved but a rat had shamed him in the
eyes of all his dignity had been lowered
his pride shaken

and then came the disaster that
caused kenyons downfall

  the south irish fusiliers ad-
vancing in long waves had stormed the
shattered death-dealing mounds of brick
and mortar which marked what once but
a few days before had been a village
nestling amid trees and gardens there had
been some fierce and bloody fighting with
bomb and bayonet among the ruins before
the enemy machine gunners had been
hunted out of their lairs and the south
irish had passed on leaving their dead to
be picked up by their stretcher-bearers

  on the further side of the village kenyon
and his company had occupied a battered
trench in support of another company in
front the parapets had been leveled
traverses had been obliterated great shells
had split the firebays into wide craters
even the entrances to the deep dug-outs
where the german garrison had sought
shelter from the storm of steel had been
rushed and broken

 dead germans caught by high ex-
plosives in the bombardment before the
charge or killed when the fusiliers burst
in on them with the bayonet lay on every
side in the strained attitudes of death

  kenyon passed along the trench driv-
ing his tired men to work giving them no
time for rest intent only on strengthening
the position they had won before ever
the inevitable counter-thrust could reach
them

come on now get to work you fellows
youve no time for idling you there start

filling those sandbags-make haste turn
the parapet the other way

  is there no chance for a bite to ait
sorr sullivan his red face streaked with
great smears of dust and sweat his tunic
unbuttoned and his shirt open to the sun
was speaking

  there is not said kenyon do you
think that the germans love you so much
theyll let you sit here and take tea
youve no time to waste get on with
your work he looked about him ser-
geant turn those men to sharply now
no idling

  he passed on the men dog-tired and
hungry as they were growled and swore
but did as they were ordered shoveling
the earth into sandbags and piling them
on to what had been the parados clearing
the trench of the debris preparing for what
they knew must come

  a harrd man but a gran sojer did ye
see him leggin it through thim ruins awhile
back an the germans yellin blue
murrdher

  i wonder how many he kilt i seen him
down three with his revolver meself
will he iver learn wisdom said
ogrady

  or know the manin of fear hes a
merricle of a man in a fight afraid of
nothin in this wurrld or the next
barrin the rats said sullivan yere
shpakin the thruth an may the divil
blishter our artillery for battherin this
thrench the way they have us slavin our
guts out

  shtow yer gab shouted the company
sergeant-major work now the lot o ye
a shell came shrieking toward the trench
and burst within fifty yards with a deep
roar a column of black smoke shot up and
a piece of heavy metal whanged viciously
against the sandbags

  there go the crumps thats the first
of em theyll give us hell now bhoys
you see if they dont

  shell followed shell in quick succession
through the crash of the explosions could
be heard the incessant screeching of their
downward rush the air was heavy with
the smell of high explosives clouds of thick
smoke enveloped everything making it
difficult to see

  the men were restless and kenyon
steadied them

  its not us theyre shelling he shouted


adventure

its b company in the trench in front of
us keep on working there you flana-
gan do you hear me take up that shovel
again at once

  as a hard fighter the irish soldier is
unsurpassable that is acknowledged but
he has his moods to be forced to work
imder heavy shell-fire to fill sandbags and
build up parapets anew to dig out traverses
and join shell-hole to shell-hole when at
any moment the enemy might launch a
sudden attack was not to the liking of
kenyons men also though no shells had
as yet landed in the trench itself though it
seemed clear that kenyon was right and
that the germans were shelling the trench
in front and the village behind their backs
nevertheless for how long would they be
immune kenyon could see by their faces
that they were troubled and uneasy

  a shell burst with a crash close up to the
parapet and a man dropped his shovel and
ran for the slanting doorway of a dug-out

  kenyon grabbed him by the collar and
jerked him back

  you stay where you are my friend
ill have no skulking in dug-outs before
theres any real need of it build that
parapet deeper thats not going to keep

a bullet out and its not your own-

rotten carcass im thinking of either

  as he moved on he heard a laugh
did ye hear that now asked sullivan
chuckling

  all the same if yere hit by a shell its
aiqual whether the germans meant it fer
you or the nixt fella an thats no lie
kenyon agreed in that the speaker
was most probably right nevertheless
shells or no shells until they had finished
rebuilding the trench his men must work

      luk at that will ye theres
      some wan cornin

          through the drifting smoke ken-
yon saw a figure approaching the trench
moving slowly over the rough ground

   tis misther ohara said the com-
pany sergeant-major an he walkin like
he was hurt

  kenyon waited wondering if ohara
brought tidings of disaster or what then
as he drew nearer he saw that he was limp-
ing that his right hand the sleeve hanging
loose from the shoulder was thrust inside
his unbuttoned tunic and that his left
thigh was drenched with blood

  all right ohara im coming
  kenyon clambered out of the trench
  whats the matter old chap hurt

much

  hurt said the boy a little his
lips twisted into a worried smile i had
to come back anyway mkeever made
me he swayed and steadied himself
against kenyons hand sorry im
all to pieces kenyon silly isnt it
come back sorr for gods sake said
the sergeant-major yere axin for
throuble the way yere sthandin out there
come back at wance

  kenyon led ohara into the trench
supporting him by one arm around his
shoulders

  im going to send you back on a
stretcher ohara the quicker the m o
sees you the better sergeant-major pass
the word along for the stretcher-bearers at
the double

  im feeling - queer said ohara

in a weak voice i cant-last out much
longer kenyon its-its my head
here said kenyon youd better he
down somewhere and rest

  i doubt if youll find any sthretcher-
bearers sorr said the sergeant-major
oreilly got killed awhile back an
moriartys afther takin another fella off
to hilp carry corpral ryan to the docthor
ryans bad with a bullet in his sthomach
but you cant lave misther ohara here
the shriek of an approaching shell grow-
ing louder and louder each instant cut short
the sergeant-majors words

  get down shouted kenyon get
down

  the shell burst with a deafening ear-
splitting roar at the far end of the firebay
covering the two officers and the sergeant-
major with a shower of chalk and stones

  ohara lay as though dead his sound
arm shielding his face

  kenyon bent over him

  are you all right ohara

  ohara began to whimper

  oh my god kenyon im done for
dont let them get me

  he sat up and clutched at kenyons arm
stark and hideous terror showed in the
boys eyes his lips quivered he was shak-
ing all over

  its those-shells kenyon i cant

hold out any longer theyll get me
i know they will they cant help it if we
in the dug-out



stay here take me away kenyon for
gods sake take me out of it you must
the voice had risen to a scream

  kenyon felt a sudden hot shame surge
through him that an officer in his battalion
one of his greatest friends as brave a man
ordinarily as ever lived should have
collapsed so hopelessly seemed almost un-
believable that it was ohara of all
men made it worse never before had
kenyon known such fear in a human being
it was more painful than anything he had
witnessed previously on the battle-field

  why should shell-fire however heavy
rob a man of his manhood it was an
officers duty to show his men how to face
death yet here was ohara a man to whom
he owed his life shivering with terror
cowering at the bottom of the trench
begging piteously to be moved to safety

  kenyon was not hard-hearted but it was
neither right nor seemly that ordinary
privates should see an officer so humiliated
wounds or no wounds ohara should have
more control

  wed besht take him into the dug-out
sorr said the sergeant-major hes in
no fit shtate to be moved with thim shellin
the village

  kenyon nodded and helped ohara to
his feet a few yards from where they
stood was an entrance to a dug-out half
choked by debris

  sergeant-major said kenyon that
dug-outs clear isnt it

   it is sorr shall i call a couple of min
sorr to lind you a hand

no ill take him down myself ohara
can you hobble along on that leg of vours
a little said ohara feebly it

hurts-like - but ill try only-get

me away out of this for gods sake

  he was weeping like a frightened child
his breath came in deep sobs his skin
had taken on a corpse-like pallor

dont leave me kenyon will you
kenyon looked at him in pity his anger
and shame vanished poor old ohara
was it possible that any one so good as he
could have gone to pieces so completely

  come on old chap im going to put
you into a dug-out till i can get you taken
away sergeant-major ill be back in a
minute make these men build up that
parapet again keep em working and
with one arm about the wounded boys
waist guided him toward the dug-out

rest all your weight on my back he
said and put your sound arm around my
neck steady now and ill have you down
in no time

  very slowly and carefully so as to cause
as little pain as possible kenyon half-
supported half-carried ohara down the
steep stairs that led out of the blazing
sunshine down past a passage that crossed
the stairs at right angles down and down
into the darkness of the dug-out

  youll be safe here he said hold
up now old chap till i get you a light

  he struck a match and lit a candle
which he had in his haversack by its
feeble glimmer he could see the four walls
of the dug-out and a shelf piled up with
rubbish in one corner a narrow bed made
of a wooden frame and thin strips of iron
on which were brown and filthy-looking
blankets and a litter of fusty straw that
smelled of rats in the center of the dug-
out a broken table lying on its side on the
floor more straw paper stained with blood
a german shrapnel helmet fragments of
food empty bottles equipment and rifles
hanging on hooks opposite the bed an old
field-gray overcoat a pickelhaube and some
odd garments at a glance kenyon knew
that the dug-out had been bombed and
he wondered if the occupants if any had
managed to escape before the south irish
had reached the trench

  he fixed the candle in a pool of its own
grease on a corner of the shelf then still
with the same care almost amazed by his
own new-born tenderness he helped ohara
on to the bed

  youll be all right here old chap he
said nothing can touch you you
wont mind if i get back to the trench
though will you

  you mustnt leave me kenyon-you
mustnt

  the wounded mans voice was little more
than a whisper

  i must ohara you wouldnt have
me leave the men would you

  ohara moaned faintly

  dont leave me alone kenyon i cant
bear it

  kenyon knew that he must be firm he
had been absent from his men too long
already supposing that even now the
trench in front had given away

  im going ohara cant help it i
must


adventure

  but as he spoke frantic to be gone yet
not wishing to appear unkind there came
a sudden whistling screech and with the
most appalling burst of sound a crash as
of the heavens splitting asunder a shell
exploded on the stairs the dug-out
plunged into darkness rocked with the
concussion kenyon was hurled back against
the timbered wall the floor seemed to rise
up under his feet and hit him and he fell
forward his senses numbed seeing nothing
hearing dully the echoes dying away and
the noise of earth falling

  he rose to his feet shaken and swearing
softly coughing as the dust settled on his
lungs then he laughed aloud

  thats lucky he said the blasted
thing must have landed slap in the entrance
by jove i might have been half-way up
the stairs

  he struck a match with a steady hand
and lit the candle which had fallen

  ohara lay quite still with his sound arm
once more protecting his face

  kenyon his nerves untouched by what
had happened but with the necessity for
reaching his men uppermost in his mind
and fearing that ohara might again detain
him made for the entrance

  and then he stopped sick with appre-
hension his blood ran cold and his heart
skipped a beat or two

  for the stairs up which he must climb
to reach his company were blocked roof-
high with masses of stone and chalk and
earth and timber sick with horror he
clutched at a bulk of timber and tugged
it did not move and he knew then that
the shell had blown in the entrance to the
dug-out and that all escape was barred
unless help should come he was a prisoner
and perhaps even now his men were fighting

kenyon looked at the solid planks
that formed the dug-outs walls and
what hope was left died within him

  then once more he turned to the en-
trance and filled with sudden frantic rage
began to claw at the debris that blocked
his path tearing out stones and earth with
his hands exerting his utmost strength to
move the timber that wedged fast between
the roof and stairs presented an impene-
trable barrier

  he had forbidden his men to enter the
dug-outs yet here was he their officer
who should have been with them in their

trench sharing the dangers that beset
them trapped in a dug-out and no mat-
ter what efforts he put forth no matter
how hard he worked single-handed he
could not escape of that he was certain
to be rescued he must be rescued from
above-or not at all

  he stepped back and surveyed the pile of
stones and earth that he had scattered at
the doorway the muscles of his arms
and back ached with the toil the sweat
trickled down his face and neck he had
done his best and to what purpose as
well might he try to demolish the whole
dug-out as to clear a passage to the open
air he was a prisoner until a party should
rescue him and supposing the germans
were to recapture the trench

  he laughed shortly then he remem-
bered ohara and crossed the small dug-
out to where the wounded man lay on the
bed in the corner

  ohara he said

  oharas face was like gray wax in the
light of the candle his eyes were closed his
ups parted

  ohara old man how are you feeling

  but ohara neither moved nor spoke

  kenyon with a sinking heart touched
him gently and then he understood

  ohara whom he had tried to help was
dead

  for a time kenyon did not move
accustomed though he was to death in all
its forms nevertheless oharas death
stirred him to the depths of his being it
was not as though he had died a soldiers
death in the open and under the sky
ohara brave and witty and happy had
died-kenyons mind sought a parallel-
like a rat in a trap in the darkness and
afraid ohara afraid it was incredible
no one in the battalion had shown such
reckless gallantry as had ohara and then
to die as he had died a prisoner in a ger-
man dug-out and afraid the thought
shook him

  kenyon whistled softly under his breath
and what chance of escape had he him-
self the one passage to the air was
blocked would there even be air for him
to breathe he sniffed the close rat-
scented atmosphere ohara had died like
a rat in a trap was he not also trapped
he shivered and a sense of depression of
horror of he knew not what stole over him

  from where he stood his back to the
in the dug-out



heap of debris he could see the whole dug-
out dimly lit by the candle the walls of
perpendicular boards the hanging gar-
ments-he wondered whether their lawful
owner were still alive whether he were a
prisoner or still fighting-the shelves the
broken table the chair the papers stained
with blood the straw the rifles and the
bed in the corner with ohara lying dead

  kenyon swore softly it came to him
as a vague possibility that he too might die
in the dug-out supposing his men were
all killed who would know then what
had become of him

  and as he brooded on what might hap-
pen each moment feeling the sense of de-
pression and dread growing within him he
heard from a dark corner of the dug-out
where paper and books and straw had been
scattered a faint scratching

  at first he paid no heed then the
scratching was repeated suddenly alert
in every sense he waited scarcely daring
to draw a breath lest he miss what might
be happening something was moving in
the corner of the dug-out where the shad-
ows were darkest he could see nothing
but he could hear some animal pattering
across the straw and papers

  and then two tiny beads of red fire ap-
peared in the darkness kenyon backed
against the wall of the dug-out and very
slowly a huge pale-gray rat mangy and
leprous the biggest he had ever seen a
monster with gleaming teeth and long
whiskers came into the circle of yellow
candle-light and sat watching him

  kenyon gazed at the animal in horror
and loathing such as he had never known
before gripped him his one impulse was
to kill

  stooping down swiftly he seized a lump
of white chalk and threw it with all his
strength his throw went wide of the
mark the chalk crunched against the wall
and the rat turned leisurely and slunk into
the shadow

kenyon wiped the perspiration
from off his forehead he felt sick
with nausea even though no mor-
tal eyes had seen him he was ashamed
excuses to justify his terror crowded into
his mind a man placed as he was a
prisoner in a dug-out from which there was
no escape might well be forgiven for losing
his control he was not frightened of that

he was positive would one who could
face shell-fire unperturbed as he could as
a matter of duty be afraid because a rat
however big or however ugly-kenyon
shuddered-was in the same dug-out
impossible nevertheless when once again
he heard the same stealthy rustling in the
corner the same slow and cautious ap-
proach he trembled

  this time the rat if possible more re-
pulsive and loathsome than before ambled
across the dug-out not in kenyons direc-
tion but toward the low bed where ohara
was lying it sat up on its haunches like
a dog begging its front paws bent its gray
nose sniffing its beady eyes red in the
candle-light its naked tail twitching until
kenyon breaking loose from the spell that
bound him made a sudden wild rush at it

  how it happened he could not tell but
the rat avoided him clumsily and crawled
under the bed and to kenyon the most
horrible part of it all was that the animal
all through never hurried never showed
the slightest fear never recognized the fact
that he the man was his master

   come out you devil

  fighting down the disgust that rose up
within him kenyon picked up one of the ger-
man rifles that lay in the corner and thrust
wildly at where he thought the rat would be

  - you you beast if i get you

ill-ill choke your life out

  blind rage against his tormentor had
taken possession of him even if he were
doomed never to escape the rat would die
for oharas sake he who had won the d s
 on the battle-field must conquer his fear

  a slight noise made him turn quickly
the rat was in the corner in which it had
first appeared watching him almost as
though-kenyon would have sworn it-
as though amused

   with a snarl of fury losing his last rem-
nants of self-control he hurled the heavy
rifle across the dug-out the rat squeaked
whether in fear or from pain he could not
tell and kenyon was alone with ohara

  but he knew he knew as surely as though
he had been told that his respite was not
for long the rat would return of course
there was something vindictive and de-
termined in the way in which it slunk in
and out of the black shadows something
cunning and diabolical that chilled ken-
yons blood even for a trench-rat its
boldness was uncanny


adventure

   kenyon waited his heart beating like a
 steamers piston his pulses throbbing
 straining his ears that he might not lose the
 slightest sound and hearing close at hand
 a scuffling and a thin squeaking and far
 away above his head the dull booming
 that he knew so well his men were fight-
 ing maybe for their very lives while he
 who would lead them gladly against the
 german trenches was sick with terror be-
 cause a rat a harmless mangey rat had
 been imprisoned with him he could have
 cried for very shames sake and had he
 not in his pride despised ohara but a
 short hour since because his nerve had
 failed him who was he to talk now of
 manhood or courage after this

   all at once with a gasp of horror as one
 plunged without warning into ice-cold
 water he became aware of a lean gray form
 slinking along the floor

   kenyon drew his revolver he would
 make no move until he could see more
 clearly then a bullet would finish matters
 once and for all

   but although he had intended not to
 take his gaze from off his enemy-to fire
 and miss would be too awful-some instinct
 forced him to turn his head quickly he
 caught his breath and could have shrieked
 aloud in sheer panic on the floor beside
 the broken table were two more rats gray
 and hideous like the first but smaller
 they watched him with fierce eyes

   kenyons hand and arm were shaking
 as he raised the revolver and fired as in
 a dream he saw one of the rats flatten it-
 self out reddening the floor with its blood
 while the other scuttled to the shelter of
 the straw

   with the echo of his shot reverberating
 through the dug-out kenyon cocked his
 revolver and wheeled about

   then his senses in a whirl mad with fury
 and fear and nausea he fired three times
 in quick succession the big dropsical
 rat the abomination that was driving him
 mad sat like a vulture on the edge of the
 bed by the side of oharas body

 as he fired kenyon knew that he
 was shouting incoherently what he
 said whether the string of words
 made sense he neither knew nor cared

   splinters flew back as the bullets plowed

 	into the thick planking but the rat crawled
 over oharas body and disappeared on the

 far side of the bed untouched and even
 now unhurried in its movements ken-
 yon stooped down and fired under the bed

  then dazed and sick stunned by a new
misfortune kenyon straightened up he
had one cartridge left and no more his
pouch was empty

  for a moment there came to him the
wild thought of putting his last bullet
through his brain and so ending his agony

  but would it be ended could he a
british soldier-and god what a miserable
specimen of a british soldier-desert ohara
now when he needed him most had
ohara deserted him when he lay helpless
caught in the german barbed wire would
it be fair to leave ohara dead and unable
to defend himself was ohara any the
less worthy now that he no longer lived
no a thousand times he would fight on
as he had always fought coward though he
owned himself unworthy though the enemy
might be until he could fight no longer

  kenyon had lost all count of time in
carrying ohara he had broken his watch
but what seemed an eternity of waiting
passed before the rat reappeared

  it was not alone the snuffling and
squeaking behind the timbers had warned
kenyon of what he might expect yet
could a rat even a trench-rat wars most
loathsome product summon help he
laughed wildly

  they came on him suddenly almost
before he realized it he was fighting laying
about him once more with the rifle sweep-
ing a wide circle from where he stood
then he stopped exhausted and despairing
what was the good

  some he had killed-one two three
four-the others-seven of them-sat just
out of reach of his rifle that clumsy ger-
man weapon and watched him the big
gray rat the leader-kenyon knew it must
be the leader-was still alive its whole
attitude was one of mockery and scorn
it seemed to be sneering at him daring
him to do his worst it could not speak
and yet to kenyons tortured mind it said

  you can not kill me try again my
gallant officer and you will find that i am
right i am too strong too powerful too
clever who are you proud soldier to
strive against me my time is coming i
can afford to wait can you

  you fiend said kenyon you fiend
from hell
in the dug-out



  he raised the rifle slowly and brought it
down swiftly with a crash but the old rat
had moved and sat a foot further away
blinking in cold scorn

  did i not tell you it seemed to say
was i not right my fine gentleman you
can not harm me hero you might once
have been but now you are afraid

  oh god said kenyon oh god
pity me

  then to his unutterable shame for it
proved how very low he had sunk how
small a man he really was he found that
he was weeping sobbing with fear and
misery as though his aching heart would
break even as ohara had sobbed after the
shell had broken his nerve

  was this the end then must he die
like this deep underground surrounded by
rats a prisoner robbed of every manly
virtue he had possessed once he had
been proud and justly proud of what he
was now rats had proved to him his
folly

  suddenly without warning and it only
wanted this disaster to complete his misery
the candle his one comfort flickered and
went out leaving him in darkness blacker
than the blackest night and with the
darkness came terror such as he had never
known a terror that was agony a terror
that stole from him his last remaining shred
of self-respect and filled him with a blind
desire to shriek for mercy to force his way
out of his prison at all costs to pray to
scream or else to die quickly before terror
killed him

  shaking all over his very strength sapped
by fear he fumbled through his pockets
lest perchance a piece of candle still re-
mained he found only letters letters
from his wife letters he might have an-
swered a pocketbook a bank-note-case
full of french notes and some silver
francs

  the scuffling and rustling and squeaking
was growing louder and more insistent
with the coming of the darkness the
rats were bolder their smell sickened
him

  he struck a match and holding it aloft
shrank from the sight that met his eyes-
eight nine ten-twelve-fifteen rats the
light burned his fingers and went out leav-
ing with him as a last impression the big
rat the gray scabrous beast sitting on
its haunches not a yard away

with that desperation that is fear
pushed beyond all endurance ken-
yon fired his revolver then dashing
forward blindly he kicked something soft
and flabby and stumbling over the table
fell with a crash on hands and knees
sharp teeth met in the fleshy part of his
thumb he screamed aloud in insane
panic and hit out madly with his revolver
and as he dealt blows right and left in the
darkness still on his knees sobbing like
some hysterical woman he called to mind
the memory of other days-such happy
days they seemed-when he an officer in
the royal south irish fusiliers-long lines
of khaki with the bayonets dazzling in the
sunshine-had fought by the light of day
with human brings now alone and far
from all help a clumsy mountebank a
laughing stock he fought with rats and
in this last most terrible battle there would
be no quarter

  doomed to die-like a rat words of
fire danced before his eyes

  like a rat he hit out with savage
energy cursing like any foul-mouthed
private-he the poet the scholar the
hero-and crawled slowly around the floor
driving his enemy before him feeling with
the fascination of horror the soft fur bodies
of the slain

  anon exhausted panting for breath he
staggered to his feet and groped his way to
where ohara was lying

  he must not desert ohara of course
ohara had saved him from the germans
he would save ohara from the rats he
would stay with him to the end what
end he wondered was lie going mad
god in heaven he had no choice he
made a virtue of what must be stay with
ohara how could he leave him what
way of escape was there he was doomed
-doomed to die like a rat fighting rats

  and after that there followed a lifetime
of horror the blackness choked him
enveloped him like a pall his tongue a
strip of dried leather clave to the roof of
his mouth the pit of his stomach seemed
sunk and empty cold waves of fear swept
over him the blood thundered in his ears
his eyes open to their widest ached with the
strain of trying to pierce the blackness

  and as he crouched beside the dead
boy his hands moved to and fro up and
down ceaselessly feeling in each direction
touching from time to time oharas thin


adventure

features or his hands or his body to reassure
himself that all was well when as often
happened his fingers came in contact with
a rat loathing and terror would overwhelm
him and he would strike with his bare fists
or make a sudden grab and sometimes to
his horror find himself gripping a strug-
gling squirming biting handful of fur and
nails and teeth and never for one in-
stant did the rustling and scuffling and
squeaking and pattering of feet cease

  never was he free from the knowledge
that behind his back the big gray rats were
watching him biding their time exulting
in his degradation he who had been
proud was in their power

  and then when flesh and blood could no
longer stand the strain when he felt that
madness in grim earnest was coming he
lit one of his last three matches it splut-
tered and flared up

  at the foot of the bed sat the big pale-
gray rat hideous and bloated its eyes
blinking with the knowledge of all evil its
pointed nose sniffing and turned this way
and that its purpose unconcealed

  the match went out and kenyon shout-
ing wild curses made a grab at the monster

  when a little later he put the muzzle of
the revolver to his head and pulled the
trigger the click of the hammer mocked
his effort the bullet he had meant to
save had been wasted it was not his fate
to die by his own hand he must fight while
life lasted did he not belong to the south
irish a regiment that had never yet given
in to an enemy was he to give in now

  and once more his breath was coming
in deep sobs he began the slow groping
circular movement with his hands knowing
that on every side were rats ten twenty
thirty forty-god alone knew the number
-surrounding him closing in nearer and
nearer watching him with red eyes licking
their ups certain of their prey

private sullivan clutched at
lance-corporal gradys arm

  whisti what the divils that
terence

  the two soldiers halted and listened

  the dug-out in which they stood the
fourth in succession which they had entered
without going above ground differed in no
wise from the others they had ransacked
there was the same look of desolation the
same unwholesome smell of damp garments

and decayed straw and rats the same litter
of equipment and scraps of food on floor
and table the same untidy bedding on the
bunks built up shipboard-fashion one
above the other against the walls

  but the deep stillness of the other rooms
of this human warren a stillness that had
been broken only by the distant thunder
of the guns was gone from close at hand
there came a faint groaning as of one in
deepest agony and the sound of slow and
tired footsteps shuffling wearily to and fro

   tis some one in another room said
ogrady

  sullivan gazed about him the noise
most surely came from the other side of the
wall at the further end of the dug-out

  isnt that a door yonda he said sud-
denly lukl

  they moved slowly toward the door
which was built of the same thick timbers
as those that lined the walls

  the moaning seemed fainter the foot-
steps had stopped

  what is it dan is it a german

  open it quick said sullivan

  ogrady puued at the wooden latch and
stood aside as the door swung slowly in-
ward his rifle in his hands ready for what
might come

  suuivan held up his candle and peered
into the blackness

  howly mither of god he cried and
started back

  for standing in the dug-out staring at
him with wild red-rimmed eyes and gray
corpse-uke face was a man muttering to
himself clad in torn blood-stained khaki
beside him stretched on a low bed was a
dead body half-covered with a brown
blanket and on the floor were rats a
score at least all dead and mangled

  by jasus tis captain kenyon said
ogrady in a shocked whisper him
what we were thinking was killed yestiday

  for pitys sake said sullivan hoarsely
luk will ye the inthrance is au
shtopped up poor fella

  but did he not see that there was a
door said ogrady

  and as the two soldiers bewildered and
startled by what met their eyes watched
the scarecrow whom they had fouowed
into battle their officer gave a hoarse
shrfll scream and with bloody hands flung
himself on a huge gray rat which was
crawling slowly away into the shadows
in the dug-out



  ive got you shouted the scarecrow
ive got you you old devil you thought
youd escape but you couldnt - you
couldnt-you hells fiend-we never give

in-we-

  then he stood up the dead rat in his red
hands and began to laugh so strangely and
so mirthlessly that the two soldiers shrank
back out of his reach

  what is it said ogrady in a hushed
voice whats he afther doing

  hes an orfcer said sullivan an a
good man terence theres been quare
wurrk here this past night wed besht be
gittin him away at wance captain ken-
yon yer honor he spoke gently and sooth-
ingly as though to a child will yerself
not come up into the fresh air an have a
luk at the bhoys

  the officer passed his hand wearily
across his forehead

  kenyon he said in a low voice yes
-of course im kenyon ive been here-
a long time eh in the dark fighting-
fighting with those devils

  but when they tried to lead him away
he resisted

  and leave him he pointed to the dead
body with them he gave another
wild laugh my god no

  he had fought with the rats for oharas
sake and he had won was he to hand
over his friend now that the dug-out had
another entrance that the door was hid-
den by the hanging clothes that a push
would have opened a way of escape he
neither knew nor cared he had beaten
off the rats and ohara was saved noth-
ing else mattered

  not until they had lifted ohara from
the bed on which he had died and borne
him through into the next dug-out and so
on into another and up the steep steps into
the open air did kenyon feel that his work
was done

  it was dawn the sun had risen and was
shining from a clear blue sky soft white
clouds touched with pink sailed slowly
overhead a faint breeze blew from the
westward the purple and violet and gold
at a distant hillside showed up beyond the
dark green woods in front red poppies and
white daisies nodded in the grass every-
thing was clean and fresh and beautiful

  kenyon conscious of a strange peace
stared about him the dull thunder of
the guns that never rested night or day

and the dead lying in the chalk with cov-
ered faces brought to his mind a sugges-
tion of some past horror he dyed the
men in the trench distrustfully who were
they he did not know them had they
seen him before these dirty unshaven men
in khaki he wondered perhaps though
they were friends perhaps they would
share his triumph

  look he said look here he
held by its tail the big gray rat he
laughed aloud see it isnt it a beauty
i killed it his rage and terror returned
you devil he shuddered with uncon-
trollable loathing you beast-take it
away quick-oh my god some one-for
gods sake his voice rose to a scream
take it away-quick or itll kill me
then shaking off the spell that gripped
him he hurled the rat over the battered
parapet and laughed triumphantly staring
from man to man until all at once he broke
off as if about to choke and clutching at
sullivans arm began to weep begging to
be taken away from the trenches or they-
he did not say who-would kill him

  he was like that in the dug-out said
sullivan dryly only not so bad

  hes mad thats whats the matther
said the company sergeant-major an tis
shell-shock thats afther doin the damage
-whin the dug-out was blown in on top of
him the besht orfcer in the battalion
the bravest man iver i seen in it an cast
yer eyes on him now dear dear lets
be gettin him out o this come sorr
come with me sure yere all right now
theres no call to worry

  the m o even before he had heard
what had happened to the dug-out said it
was shell-shock the worst case he had ever
had the misfortune to see kenyon scarce-
ly understood he did not care what they
called it all he asked for was to be taken
away from the war

  there was only the one thing to do they
sent him to england a broken white-faced
wreck with terror lurking in his sunken eyes
a poor sick man who cried weakly when
left by himself with no one near at hand to
call in case they his enemies found him

there came a day when he was
well enough to see his wife

  she sat by his bedside and held
his hand in hers kenyon felt strangely
comforted and yet ashamed almost too




i

adventure

ashamed to look her in the face and tell her
he was happy now at last

  she was too good for him he knew he
wondered stabbed deep with remorse why
why in the past dead years before mankind
went mad he had been so blind now it
was too late how could he a coward
dare to hope that any woman much less
this perfect woman could still love him
how could he who had shown himself
unfit to be a soldier who had disgraced his
regiment hold up his head again and
he a coward had dared look down on poor
ohara the finest man god ever made

  it was not until kenyon had left the
hospital and had for three long weeks been
forced by fate to act a lie that the truth
came out

  on a still calm evening in september he
and his wife walked side by side between
tall dark hedges of box the sun had set
in a blaze of glory and the sky still glowed
crimson and gold in the west rooks cawed
sleepily in the elm-trees behind the house
and from near at hand a thrush sang a last
good night

  from time to time some irresistible im-
pulse would urge kenyon to glance over
his shoulder as though suspicious that
something-he was stronger now but he
would not say what even to himself-
were following at his heels

  his wife slipped an arm through his

  old boy what is it

  and then he stopped and releasing her
arm gently stood studying the freshness of
her beauty

  what is it alan why are you looking
at me like that

  he pulled himself together the part
he played sickened him yet play it he
must to the bitter end

  youre too good for me sweetheart

  too good said his wife you

  the amazement she felt was expressed in
her voice she too good for him after
what he had done and suffered for his
country

  alan she said softly what is it
dearest old boy sometimes i wonder if
you really understand how much you mean
to me youre everything ive got every-
thing when you were out in france
fighting bravely suffering all those hard-
ships i nearly died i dont know now
dearest how i lived through all those
months of waiting it was agony any

day i might have heard what i dreaded
at any moment when i was safe at home
asleep at dinner shopping you my hus-
band might have been lying dead

  i used to find myself thinking where
is he now what is he doing is he in
battle and i would feel that my heart
was breaking it didnt matter where i
was or with whom and alan i couldnt
cry i wasnt able to-not then i suf-
fered too much

  she hesitated smiling a little her eyes
soft with tears

  i thought id tell you old boy to let
you know what you mean to me if you
had been killed id have died life
wouldnt have been worth living any longer
im not brave dear and i was so proud
of you dearest so awfully proud of what
you did it isnt-isnt every woman that
has a hero for a husband it makes it
worse doesnt it me being such a coward
kenyon felt that he was choking

  a coward he muttered no love
not that youre no coward love my
god and i never knew-never and
you think im brave you say youre
proud of me doris youre wrong-youve
been wrong ah along oh my god i

wish-i wish-

  a longing to confess to have her share
his secret surged over him but he knew
in his heart it would never be though
the whole world should learn the truth his
wife must never know he must keep his
secret hard though it might be

he shivered and glanced once
more over his shoulder into the
purple shadows afraid lest down
the path between the tall dark hedges there
might come stealing after him   

  his wife put her hands on his arms in
her voice was a sudden note of fear

  alan what is it love why are you
looking like that hadnt you better come
in its-its getting a bit chilly

  im not-not quite myself sometimes
he said hoarsely its- he found the lie
ready to his lips its those shells i keep

thinking every minute-

  i understand i know what it must
have been dear

  im not fit to be your husband doris
im-im a wreck now good for nothing-
good for nothing at all im sorry for your
sake dear but i cant help it i wish i
in the dug-out





could my soldierings finished and im
not wanted-im scrapped they wont
send me out again-they know what i am
im not all that you think i am doris
will you forgive me

  she looked at him with a wistful ex-
pression there was something he was
hiding from her some secret that was hers
by right to share he was in trouble yet
he dared not tell her what was wrong
that he her husband once so proud so
self-reliant he this quiet man with the
lines of suffering in his face could have
been so brave in battle and then broken
in health and spirit could have come to her
beseeching her pardon for what he had not
done was past all understanding she felt
strangely humble yet glad to think that
in spite of all he needed her

  alan theres something wrong i know
why wont you tell me cant you trust
me love

  and as she watched him she felt sud-
denly that the love she bore him was like a
mothers love toward her little son he
was in trouble and in need of comfort
was not that sufficient 

  he had drawn back and was staring at her
with the weary look she knew so well

  cant you tell me she repeated
why not

  all thought of denial had vanished she
had said that something was wrong could
he deny it and yet he dared not tell
his pride had sealed his lips coward
though he might be to her he must be a
hero until his dying day

  no he said i cant tell you dearest
and then something came rustling
through the hedge some animal kenyon
uttered a hoarse cry of fear as a rat brushed
against his leg and vanished headlong into
the shadows

  my god-its found me doris-did
you see doris its found me

  he shivered with terror uncontrollable
alan what is it alan dear dont
look like that for pitys sake

  the pressure of her hands on his steadied
him and gave him strength the love and
pity in her eyes urged him to speak

   i killed it he said yes i did kill it
i remember now-in the dug-out i must
be mad because if i killed it then it cant
- some thread seemed to snap and he
broke off abruptly did i frighten you
dearest you understand now though

dont you im a coward afraid of rats
and then speaking in a low monotonous
voice he told his story hiding nothing
excusing nothing he told of the dug-out
and the explosion his fight with the rats
his fear and oharas death

  im a broken man ill never be any
use again they said it was shell-shock
but it isnt god no its just that im
afraid of rats thats all nothing but rats
id rather die a hundred deaths id suffer
anything rather than face them again
its true doris i would and they called
me brave me why doris im as big
a coward as ever walked this earth

  do you know that im saying now what
i thought i never could say-even to you
do you wonder that im miserable and
unhappy could i be anything else ive
lost everything my pride my manhood
and now-now that you know ive lost
you how could you bear me any respect
after-after what i told you

  the bitterness with which he ended
brought the tears to her eyes

  youre my husband she said and she
smiled tenderly is not that sufficient
need i say more than that alan youve
told me your secret now ill tell you mine
yes he said wearily yes dear
darling i loved you when you were
strong and well and had little real need of
me you know that dont you but alan
i was always a little afraid of you you were
so clever i loved you still more when you
were far away in france and i read all that
youd done and how brave you were but it
frightened me when i thought of the differ-
ence between us but dearest now that
youve come back to me tired and worn
out and ill now that youve told me what
youve suffered i love you more than ever
i did-and i think-i think youre the
bravest man i ever heard of

  he stared at her in dumb amazement
had she not understood what he had said
or must he put things even more plainly
he had made it clear that he was a coward
yet she still loved him it was impossible
of course how could she love a man who
was afraid not of shells but of rats

  then with the same tender smile on her
lips and her eyes shining she put her hands
on his shoulders and kissed him proudly

  youre mine alan and thats enough
come dear its getting dark well go
indoors

carried by the triumphant

	miami along the maumee to

the east and south to the ohio little
turtle whose fathers kindled the first fires
at detroit had counted his second great
coup over the whites his defeat of
general harmar on the maumee the pre-
ceding fall however was not to be com-
pared with this terrific punishment of st
clairs army and through the desolate
november forests sped the exulting mes-
sengers chosen to carry the red the
miami were noted for swiftness of foot
and the red news radiated rapidly chicka-
saw and cherokee south of the kentucky
wedge of civilization separating them from
their northern brothers would take heart
again and forget old feuds in a common

assault on the white settlements once
the red sticks proclaimed the great victory
to the eastern tribes old hopes would
blaze up

  abreast of the red sticks raced the lean
and lanky kentucky scout joe bund
striving to outstrip the red death and warn
the settlements and lonely cabins along the
ohio that hell was loosed that the son of
a miami chief and a mohican mother was
reaching his tomahawk over the fair
country

 the miami called bund the eagle
kendawa he had lost precious time by
sticking to the fighting till the retreat
sounded and became a ghastly rout it
was midday of that fateful november
fourth before he drew clear of the ruck of
fugitives and even then although real-
izing many lives depended upon his fleet


red sticks



feet he had tarried to answer some pitiful
call for help where some lone soldier was
dying slowly he knew he should have
stolen away in the first gray hour of fighting
before selected bands of miami warriors
could be dispatched for surprise attacks
but he was human and he had lingered
till every vestige of hope was gone as a
result he was not the first to leave the
stricken field

  all about him the silent woods were
sprinkled with the swift-stealing enemy
and he could only hope there were none
directly ahead that some had passed
his way was made evident by the bodies
of the slain militiamen he occasionally came
upon these poor devils had fled at the
first assault only to be overtaken if a
few won clear to spread the alarm their
cowardice was partly atoned for

   for weapons the scout retained his knife
and war-ax for sustenance a pouch of
parched corn which he munched as he ran
for hours he sped through the interminable
forest before coming to a settlement this
consisted of half a dozen new cabins on
stillwater creek erected a few months
before when it was believed that st
clairs expedition would make the country
safe

   he groaned in deep relief as a tall man
kentucky rifle in hand emerged from the
nearest cabin he had feared the indians
had made the creek ahead of him the
settler  recognizing the forest dress of
the scout dipped up a gourd of water from
a pail and ran forward to meet the runner
his eyes lighting wildly a woman ap-
peared in the doorway behind him her face
strained and white two children clinging
to her skirts

   sainclairs licked ter hell were bunds
first words been afeerd id git here too
late the injuns are on both sides of ye
but i reckon the path due south is open
tell yer neighbors strike for the ohio
little turtlell be swarmin down this crick
in no time

  the man stared stupidly the woman
reacted instantly uttering a sharp com-
mand to the children she darted back
into the cabin to make up some light packs
the children ran to the other cabins shrilly
shrieking-

   injuns injuns

   the man shivered and nervously exam-
ined his rifle and glared apprehensively

toward the forest wall of naked branches

  thought sainclair was goin to give
em their needins he muttered as the
scout leaned against a stump pumping for
breath

  bund held out the gourd and while the
settlers shaking hand was filling it he
rapidly informed

  everything done wrong harmar told
him he was in for a lickin i told him the
same thing when he lost so much time at
this very crick why afore we left here
the six-months men was bleatin to go
home he never oughter took any six-
months men for injun fightin right
after we quit here the bread give out
week afore we struck the river plain near
st marys some- of the militia deserted
colonel hamtrancks first regiment o
reglars-our best troops-was sent after
em

  then we was outfitted poor lots o
guns was no good an some of the powder
would scarcely burn sainclair wasl so
sick he couldnt git on his hoss without
help i was out on a scout when the army
struck the wabash and camped that
was night afore last and sainclair didnt
have any guides worth shucks and they
didnt even know theyd reached the
wabash think o that i got back
yesterday mornin when it was still cold
and dark and was makin my report to
major ouldham-they got him-when the
devils jumped us moren a thousand of
em little turtle in command general
butler was killed-

     gawd one of our best officers  gasped
the settler

  he had lots of compny grimly assured
bund tightening his belt inside  four
hours we dropped nine hundred men in a
patch no biggern ten acres for miles
the woods is plastered with everything
a scared man can heave away means hell
for the ohio the heathens carryin the
red sticks to the alleghany and kentucky
better help yer woman hurry up a bit
im off

  he darted away just in time to escape
a dozen men and women running forward
to question him although young in years
he was a veteran in border craft he could
not understand how commanders could
proceed as had harmar and st clair
he wondered if the lesson would ever be
learned the braddock massacre on the


adventure

monongahela had taught military leaders
nothing it would seem

  he had served with the harmar ex-
pedition when the miami villages at the
head of the maumee were destroyed at
that time he believed he followed a leader
who knew how to fight then he had seen
the militia colonels rash lust for battle
override harmars judgment with the men
rushing into two deadly ambuscades that
experience and this overwhelming defeat
of st clair sickened him with the con-
viction that the ohio country was now
closed to settlers for many years

  light as a shadow he threaded the forest
skirted marshes and crossed unnamed
streams on driftwood or by swimming the
icy waters his gaze ever seeking a pioneers
smoke all about him were speeding the
red sticks at any moment he might
encounter the van of the raiders for several
bands had left the river ahead of him
within another twenty-four hours the
whole ohio country from the river to the
great lakes would be blazing with triumph-
ant council fires and he shuddered as he
thought of those not fortunate enough to
die in battle

it was on the edge of evening-
and he had run like a machine since
warning the stillwater creek settle-
ment-that he came to halt he had
barely pushed back his light fur cap when
an arrow clipped through his left arm and
pinned it to his deerskin hunting shirt
he dropped behind a black walnut in-
stantly and his assailant sounded a yell
of triumph and leaped from cover with
the resilience of tempered steel the scout
sprang to his feet his right arm whipping
back and then forward and the miami
went down with the war-ax buried in his
forehead

  without pausing to recover his ax bund
resumed his flight breaking off the arrow-
head and withdrawing the shaft as he ran
with his teeth and free fingers he bandaged
the wound and fashioned a sling of rawhide
thong

  ill be cussed if i aint fetched up with
em pretty good runnin and they havin
hours start o me little turtle started
em south the minute he see he was winnin
now to break through and take the lead
reckon that cusss war-whoop is drawin
em in on me from all directions

  that this conclusion was warranted
was shown by a shrill ululating call in the
west more ominous was the answering
signal on the scouts left for it was closer
at hand the gathering darkness short-
ened his line of vision and forced him to
lessen his pace the war-cry of the warrior
he had slain was drawing the savages in to
investigate why he did not answer their
signals

  now that finesse must take the place of
speed bund halted and arranged the sling
about his wounded arm and briefly pon-
dered over his predicament the advance
guard of victorious warriors shrewdly
rushed toward the ohio by little turtle
instead of being allowed to tarry for the
terrible scenes following the massacre was
well abreast if not entirely surrounding him
these would be picked warriors traveling
fast and furious to prevent fugitives from
warning the river settlements

  the scout had lost some four hours by
remaining to fight the rear-guard action
the dead indians war-cry had advertised
the discovery of a victim his failure to
sound the scalp-halloo had told the rest
of the story

  they know hes wiped out and now
theyll try to bottle me up bund told
himself as he felt his way with his feet
through a dark grove reckon im a
mighty poor eagle-reckon sainclairs
lickin will send this neck o the woods to
the devil a-flyin

  the black growth gave way tc an opening
as bund discovered by the sudden re-
appearance of stars in the frosty heavens
he crouched warily and cursed his ill-luck
the opening was an additional handicap
to make a detour would cost precious time
and probably throw him into the clutches
of the miami to advance was to discard
his last defense-secrecy-providing the
warriors in the rear should be close at hand
and he believed they were

  a sharp yelp on his right quickly
answered by a similar signal on his left
forced his decision but what put new life
into his heels was the repetition of the call
a short distance behind him without
hesitating longer he scudded into the
opening

  he had covered only a few rods when he
struck a patch of corn and his heart quailed
in anguish corn meant a cabin and a
cabin with the miami already upon it
red sticks



  ill be cussed if they dont have their
chance such as it is he grunted dropping
to his knees to locate the squat outlines
against the skyline

  there it stood black and silent an
outpost of the white mans hunger for home
and land symbolic of the whole bloody
business of remaking a continent hordes
of adventurers had come and gone up and
down the ohio and mississippi without
leaving a trace except as rusty bits of war-
harness and broken bones were sometimes
found in the forest mold but such wan-
derers had come for gold and their impress
on the country was as transitory as the
trails their feel had made

  this small structure of laboriously hewn
logs spelled permanency something to be
defended and fought for and god what
dismay would his message bring to many
such humble habitations were he spared to
continue his mission

  he ran to the door and his flesh crawled
when he found it wide open falling on
his knees he swept his free hand over the
floor of hard-packed earth

  there aint no one here he whispered
his dread of finding silent forms dropping
from him thank god some o the
deserters got through and fetched the
word

  now that he was in the cabin he became
conscious of an awful thirst it seemed
as though his lungs would burst if he did
not find water he located a gourd but
it was empty there was a kettle in the
fireplace also empty by the feel of the
ashes he knew the fire had died out a good
twelve hours back the occupants prob-
ably had fled early that morning warned
by soldiers who had deserted the night
before the battle next his exploring hand
fell upon a tiny moccasin and he knew
frantic parents were being handicapped in
their flight by a little child with peculiar
persistency for detail his mind instantly
decided the child was a girl

  but of drink there was nothing he
straightened and bumped his head on a
rough shelf his right hand flew to it at
once and he grunted softly as his fingers
closed about a small wide-necked bottle

  hungrily tearing off the birch-bark cover
with his teeth he was rewarded by a faint
aroma of whisky he tipped the bottle
eagerly but his lips remained dry he was
puzzled as well as disappointed the bottle

was partly filled with something that
smelled of whisky he shook it gently
and felt its contents move despite his
desperate situation he took time to place
the bottle on the floor and insert two
fingers he drew forth some kind of fruit
placing it in his mouth he chewed it
ecstatically murmuring-wild cherries
put up in whisky only the whiskys most
gone

  he hastily placed several more of the
little cherries in his mouth intending to
finish the bottle when a soft movement
outside the cabin warned him he had
tarried too long to the untrained ear it
might have been the beating of a night
birds wing or the almost inaudible foot-
fall of a wolf but bund interpreted it
correctly hastily tipping the bottle up-
side down in his palm he caught the pre-
served fruit and dropped it into a pocket
of his hunting shirt then he drew his
knife and stepped to the door

  a low signal rippled round the opening
telling him the cabin was inside the circle
one or more savages had come to investigate
the small building the scout stepped to
the left of the door so that his knife-hand
might have free play and waited

  there was no further sound but he soon
discerned a dark object on a level with his
eyes and within a foot of him a warrior
had thrust his head over the threshold
the scout detected his suppressed breath-
ing  motionless and holding his own
breath he drew back the knife hoping the
savage would withdraw and report the place
deserted the warrior made a guttural
sound and began sniffing curiously

  bund immediately guessed the truth
the miami had caught the scent of the
preserved fruit and the faint odor of
whisky he grunted joyously and stepped
over the threshold his right hand falling
on bunds face he essayed to leap back
a shriek of warning pealing from his lips
but bund lunged fiercely the savage
went to his knees the knife buried in his
throat over the writhing body leaped
the scout only to run into the arms of
several indians

  the shouts of triumph quickly changed
to the death-cry as the miami stumbled
over the body of the dead savage a fire
sprang up as if by magic and by its
flare bund read a fearful purpose in the
ferociously painted faces


adventure

  kendawal exulted one of his captors
seizing liis right hand and holding it over a
blazing roll of birch bark

  yes yer dog gritted bund and making
no effort to release his hand but showing
his contempt by spitting a cherry into the
face of his torturer

  then in the miami dialect

  if your chiefs mother hadnt been a
mohican youd be running toward the
setting sun today miami men are old
women you are fleet of foot as the ante-
lope because youve been chased from your
hunting grounds by potawatomi kickapoo
shawnee and every other tribe thats
wanted your land you have run away so

much-

  he ceased his harangue to gape in amaze-
ment the burning bark had been removed
from his hand before it could do any harm
and his captors were ignoring him to stare
at something held in the palm of his torturer

  it was the preserved cherry tiny and
firm and round and red its effect had
been more striking than a bullet the
circle of morose faces were glaring at it
incredulously at last the savage holding
it gingerly raised it to his nose and sniffed
then placed it in his mouth the circle
grunted and waited for his decision

  a fresh ripe cherry he announced
licking his lips over the suggestion of
whisky accompanying the fruit

  bund who had only hoped his raillery
would bring a merciful death by tomahawk
or knife now understood that the cherry
was a miracle to them taking advantage
of the flickering light and the absorbed
attention of his captors he managed to fish
out two of the tiny fruit and pass them to
his mouth unnoticed

  an evil spirit whispers to papakeecha
protested a warrior cherries have not
ripened for many moons snow is on the
way do flowers grow in winter do
birds mate after the leaves fall there are
no ripe cherries

  bund broke in

  flat belly has heard no evil spirit he
has seen the magic of kendawa whose
manito is mighty

  the eagle flies over the ground but is
he a magician demanded the skeptic

  the white mans manito works when he
is needed kendawa is a magician re-
plied bund and he expelled a cherry into
the face of the last speaker

  the skeptic caught the fruit and held it
close to the flaming bark to study it he
found it a bright red reminder of early
summer there was no questioning its
appearance to make certain the savage
delicately split it with his knife and dis-
closed the pit as a final test he plopped
it into his mouth the others watched
him with breathless interest and observed
he nodded with grim enjoyment as his
palate was tickled by the suggestion of
fire-water and was soothed by the piquancy
of the tart fruit doubly delectable now
winter was swinging down from the
north

  probly the first redskins to taste a wild
cherry out of season thought bund

  kendawas manito is mighty conceded
the warrior after swallowing the cherry
we have only known him as one who runs
swiftly now he is a magician he shall
show his magic to michikinikwa

  the scout grew cold he had no desire
to face little turtle who had won highest
place among the miami despite the fact
his fathers rank had helped him none
for by the indian rule of the miami of
tracing ancestry through the mother he
was a mohican he had gained place and
fame while young because of his unusual
merits to impose on such would require
the utmost nerve and finesse

  he shall escape the torture so long as
he spits ripe cherries declared flat belly

  bund winced if not discovered his
stock of cherries could not exceed more
than forty or fifty he estimated if found
upon him the miracle would lose nothing
by the discovery but he would be com-
manded to instantly refill the pocket

  let him spit more cherries now urged
a savage whose wrinkled nostrils evidenced
he had caught the subtle scent of the
preservative

  kendawas manito works not at the
word of a miami squaw haughtily
informed bund

  the savage caught his right hand and
closed hi teeth on a finger intending to
bite off a nail but flat belly took umbrage
and pulled him back reminding

  he is my prisoner mine was the first
hand to touch him

  by this time warriors were pouring in
from the forest the word having been
passed that a mighty white magician had
been captured a man who held the seasons
red sticks



in his mouth and could spit ripe fruit when-
ever he would although it be the moon of
honking geese flat belly quickly ob-
served he was an object of unusual im-
portance among his brothers

  to possess a captive whose manito con-
trolled the seasons was a unique dis-
tinction his was the first hand to fall
on the scout as he leaped through the
doorway not even little turtle could
take his prisoner from him without up-
setting indian etiquette and usage various
warriors now began bidding for the scout
eagerly offering their fresh scalps their
shares of coats powder-horns and rifles
gathered from the rout

  but all these tilings flat belly could
secure for himself any time now the
red man was to conquer the white race
twice already little turtle had furnished
the miami with rare pickings but only
the gods sent prisoners who could spit ripe
cherries on the brink of winter and em-
broider the gift with the aroma of penn-
sylvania whisky to bunds great relief
flat belly scorned all offers tying the
scouts hand behind his back and placing
a slip-noose about his neck the indian drove
him into the forest making north

  bunds veins grew hot with hope not
for himself but for the settlements along
the ohio his capture had halted the ad-
vance of the enemy for he was satisfied
every member of the scouting party within
reach of the tremendous news a white
magician had been captured was following
him and his proud captor it was char-
acteristic of the indian mind to become
unmindful of the war partys original
purpose in hastening south

   ill be cussed if they can do any moren
burn me he grimly decided mebbe
its better im caught i might a led em
full-bent on to the little gal and her folks
they have a extry chance to make the ohio
and theyll carry the word of alarm as well
as me what with em and the deserters
who warned em the settlers oughter have
time to cross into kentucky

little turtle was exceedingly
wroth with his warriors because of
their failure to push on to the
beautiful river his anger was tempered
somewhat when he learned their reason
for hastening back they had captured a
white magician whose manito allowed him

to transpose the seasons he could make
ripe cherries to come back when he would
and the grass to grow green and lush
though it be deep winter

   he could provide pasturage for the buffalo
the year round and stop their wandering
far south in search of feed surely none
but the miami ever had captured such a
prisoner to be sure he was the personal
property of flat belly but his works must
redound to the advantage and advancement
of the entire miami people

  little turtle did not believe these
fantastic rumors yet his curiosity was
sharply aroused

  bring the white man to me he com-
manded

   flat belly proudly led forth his captive
after removing the ropes from his neck and
hand bund stood composed of bearing
in the middle of the wide circle of interested
warriors his wounded arm hanging at his
side two fingers of the right hand being
hooked in the pocket of his hunting shirt
little turtle was disappointed and harshly
demanded

  what is he called he is not even a
chief i saw him fighting among the
soldiers

  kendawa spoke up bund

   so michikinikwa has caught an eagle
sneered the chief the others were clumsy
game and he paused to allow his proud
gaze to range over the heaps of plunder
awaiting distribution michikinikwa has
heard the eagle makes medicine

   ignoring the irony in the chiefs tone
bund gravely assured

   straight tongues have spoken to mich-
ikinikwa the manito of the eagle is
very strong

  but the words fell strange on mich-
ikinikwas ears for they spoke of magic
that tosses the seasons back and forth
like pebbles in the hand of a child

  they were true words haughtily de-
clared bund now nerved to play his re to
the limit

   and yet this mighty manito of the white
man did not help him to escape the miami
reminded the chief

  his capture brought back michikini-
kwas warriors his manito willed that
one should be taken that many might
escape countered the scout palming two
cherries before allowing his right hand to
drop at his side


adventure

  little turtles face for a moment
grimaced with fury as he realized the
truth of this but his voice was gentle as
he continued

  it is said the white mans magic can
make the pawpaw and black walnut put
forth new leaves the year round

  even that is easy for the manito of the
eagle quietly declared bund

  when crooked tongues speak to michi-
kinikwa he pulls them out by the roots
warned the chief extending his sinewy
fingers suggestively

  it is good said bund

  he could feel the impact of the savage
gaze of the warriors massed behind him
and from the tail of his eye observed the
rapt attention of those on either side of the
chief all were rigid and silent as they
watched the unfolding of the drama nor
was there one who failed to realize that
little turtle was aroused to a mighty pitch
of fury at the calm bearing of the prisoner
and his colossal claims and bund knew
he must win out or suffer as no prisoner
of the miami had yet suffered

  can kendawa make corn grow little
turtle taunted

  his manito can make corn grow now
readily answered bund

  the circle of warriors moved uneasily
a climax dearly to the liking of the red man
was at hand in dramatic values it sur-
passed the stake nor was there lacking
frank admiration for the bold demeanor
of the scout even little turtle was im-
pelled to approve of a man who composedly
claimed so much

  will the eagles manito make com grow
now he softly asked and leaned forward
to catch the answer

  bund shrugged his shoulders and replied
michikinikwa of the toonpaoh clan
my manito is ready to tell you things of
much more importance than the growing of
corn

 the use of the mohican term for
turtle the clan of the chief was a subtle
touch and did not fail to register an effect
on the chief it betokened the white mans
knowledge of his eventful and ambitious
history it appealed to his pride that his
ancestry through mother-right should be
intimately known by his enemies but no
flattery could cause him to overlook the
scouts evasion and his eyes lighted in
triumph

  throwing off his air of restraint he sternly
commanded-

  come if you are a magician make corn
grow

  the encircling warriors hunched forward
their eyes glistening the fate of the white
man was ensconced within the next few
seconds

  the corn is scarcely harvested if the 
eagle showed green com in his talons
michikinikwa would say it was some trick
why should the mighty manito of kendawa
do childs play when its tongue is heavy with
grave words for the miami was the scouts
answer

  a deep sigh of disappointment at such a
tame conclusion rose from the spectators
and in fierce triumph little turtle cried
out

  your tongue is crooked your manito
is an old man he is very lame he falls
down and can not get up papakeecha
put this man to the torture

  bund turned aside his head as though to
show his contempt and stared away to
where the forest crown and leaden clouds
met he had but one card to play and
he knew he must play it at the apex of the
situation his knowledge of the indian
character had warned him he must assert
the dignity and independence of his manito
before performing any works and insofar
as little turtle ignored the tribal law con-
cerning the fate of prisoners by so much
would he weaken himself to the correspond-
ing advantage of the captive

  this man is a liar put him to the
torture at once papacheeka passionately
repeated the chief

  bund whistled softly and continued
gazing at the somber sky flat bellys
face became convulsed with rage at the
command the warriors moved about un-
easily the white man was flat bellys
prisoner and although all envied him yet
there was the law of the tribe

  michikinikwa is a mighty war chief
and his brothers are proud to follow him
rumbled flat belly but the white man
is my prisoner if he makes corn grow
michikinikwa shall have the first ears-a
gift from papakeecha the white man is
my prisoner according to the law of the
miami

  his words met with low notes of approval
a wild desire to bury his war-ax in the
stubborn flat bellys head filled the heart
red sticks



of little turtle but he betrayed nothing
of his feeling he held his high position
because of his ability to study situations
from all sides he knew his leadership
would endure only so long as he was
successful he could not compel the
service of any warriors

  the indian fought when he chose and
under whom he chose and did he tire of a
project he could abandon it at any time a
warriors dream could disrupt an extensive
organization for offensive war and a war-
chief without a following had no prestige
little turtle always spoke of the miami
people as i but there were lengths to which
he could not go

  he inclined his head gravely as flat
belly finished and then addressed bund
saying

  your manito has a message for me-the
miami after it is spoken perhaps he will
grow corn for me

  i bring a message to michikinikwa
stoutly replied bund believing the first
crisis had passed

  speak kendawa but we talk without
belts

  the chiefs words were smoothly spoken
but they contained the reminder he was
committing himself none as to his future
conduct

  my manito bids me say to you oh
michikinikwa that the time draws near
when you will talk with peace belts to the
thirteen fires the thirteen colonies and
will be glad to do so

  the boldness of this speech and its
insolence in view of the unburied dead
along the wabash wrung little exclama-
tions of anger from the assembly

  when i talk with the thirteen fires
they will accept my terms or die out
hissed little turtle trembling with rage
it will take many snows to bury the
dead the white men have left along the
wabash

  yet you will carry to the thirteen fires
only the mnoti

  the miami may carry the bag contain-
ing peace belts to the thirteen fires as
your lying manito says but it will be only
after kendawas magic has changed the
seasons back and forth as some foolish
warriors seem to believe it can do was
the fierce retort

  bund thrilled he had worked the scene
up to the one climax that might save him

and had forced the chief to lead the way
throughout slowly swinging his gaze back
till it rested on little turtles fierce coun-
tenance he demanded

  michikinikwa speaks of the seasons
as though they were fixed in their places
cherries blossomed and ripened months
ago are there any ripe cherries now
can the miami warriors go forth and bring
back ripe cherries to their war-chief as
he awaited an answer he folded his hands
before him passing the preserved fruit into
his left

  the wild geese fill the gray sky
sullenly replied the chief the beaver
has cut his wood for winter there are no
ripe cherries

  as little turtle ceased speaking bund
took a dramatic step forward and extended
his wounded arm with the hand held
palm up little turtle stared as though
hypnotized at the two ripe cherries thus
revealed his startled eyes were raised
to meet the calm glance of the white man
very slowly as though held back by
caution he reached forth and gingerly took
the fruit and fingered it gently

  he was amazed to find it was genuine
to all appearances he bit into one of the
cherries and examined the pit while his
warriors held their breath there were
clever indian magicians some very skilful
in legerdemain but there was none who
could produce ripe cherries in november
little turtle had watched them make
plants grow and flower and bear fruit but
always in the shadows near some smoking
camp-fire aided and abetted by their
blankets and in all such instances plant
fruit and flower were artificial and would
not bear investigation

  although he was much more astute than
his followers he still was an indian and
unable to doubt the evidence of his senses
he had tasted one cherry and found it to be
genuine he ate the other and enjoyed
the relish

  what words has the great michi-
kinikwa to say to the eagles manito now
demanded the scout in a stentorian voice
drawing himself haughtily erect and hooking
his hand into his hunting-shirt pocket
which is greater medicine to make
corn grow when the harvest season is just
over or to bring the moon of cherries into
the moon of wild geese

  low murmurs of approval ran round


adventure

the circle flat bellys magician had
vindicated his medicine

  little turtle slowly confessed-

  the manito of kendawa is mighty
michikinikwa speaks wise words it
is well and remember that as surely as
you have eaten ripe cherries when snow
is in the air just so surely will you carry
peace belts to the thirteen fires

  and with this forceful prophecy bund
raised his right hand above his head and
scattered a shower of the fruit over flat
belly and the warriors about him

  the effect of this demonstration was over-
whelming it left little turtle rigid and
voiceless the warriors lost their reserve
and grunted loudly at the prodigality
of the eagles manito flat belly dropped
on his knees to gather up the fruit and
cram it into his slit of a mouth

greatly disturbed at the scouts words
and at this further miracle little turtle
on recovering his power of speech directed
papakeecha take the white magician
away his manito is mighty

in accepting the command of
the third expedition against the
miami and allied tribes general
wayne mad anthony conferred much
with president washington on indian war-
fare and profited thereby he refused
to accept six-months men or any who
were not americans he gave special
attention to bayonet and broadsword drill
and refused to take the field till his legion
had been trained for two years for the
bloody work ahead

  but when he finally struck the combined
forces of the indians on the maumee he
smashed the confederacy within sixty

minutes of fighting thereby cementing the
united states hold on the northwest
territory among the delegates from the
various indian nations to confer with
general wayne at greenville in the summer
of  was the famous little turtle

  he spoke eloquently for the miami and
was answered generously by wayne ninety 
chiefs and delegates representing twelve
tribes signed the treaty swearing perpetual
peace and placing their people under the pro-
tection of the united states the success
of the lengthy conference was as great a
triumph as was the last battle on the
maumee throughout the sessions scout
bund stood behind wayne serving as
interpreter no signs of recognition passed
between him and little turtle

  but after the treaty was signed and
little turtle was about to return to his
people he halted before the scout and said

  kendawas manito is mighty michi-
kinikwa has brought peace belts to the
thirteen fires even as was said does
kendawa still have ripe cherries out of
season

  not since the young english officer
ransomed him for a keg of rum from
papakeecha at detroit now the peace
bag has been opened between michikinikwa
and the big wind wayne kendawas
manito has no need for magic michi-
kinikwa is now my brother

  michikinikwa salutes his brother the
eagle i am the last to sign the peace
treaty and i will be the last to break it

  with this sententious declaration he
strode into the forest and history records
that his tongue was straight and that for
the remainder of his years he was faithful
to his new allegiance

ill watkins was deceptive
soft of speech by reason of tuning
his tongue to the musical vowels
of the greasers and dagoes he
caressed with inoffensive oaths in the rock
pit of the cement mill in the pescadero
mountains patient through long handling of
raw unskilled labor and with blue twink-
ling honor eyes he passed at first sight for
easy but bill drew down a hundred and
fifty per was in line for the superintendents
job at thirty-one and had no weaknesses
worth the mention unless it were a fondness
for poker if it can be called a weakness in
one who played for the game

  there are just three ways of digging up
the man within the man he was wont to
say one is to go and shut yourself up
with him twelve months in a cabin which is
apt to be tedious another is to get him so
full of licker that his guards drop away and
the man comes out naked which aint
amusing the third and best is to sit in with
him at poker

  bills hobby was to know men mrs
goodyear the superintendents wife lec-
tured him on his gambling she was de-
ceived bill was no gambler so was
adolf olsen deceived adolf ran a rake-off
game under police protection at his road-
house just across the santa cruz-san
mateo county-line adolf was a big big
swede who thought he was wise

  when bill off-saddled one saturday even-
ing at his road-house and invited the gentry
lounging hopefully around to a smile
adolfs saucer-blue eyes took an inventory
he inventoried corduroy pants with a lump
left pocket from which bill carelessly fisted a
loose handful of gold and silver an unbut-
toned vest held loosely over a flannel shirt
by a gold chain chunky enough to float a
liberty loan a right top pocket bulging
with cigars and a left that did duty as

adventure

with red-cross badges at a dollar a throw
adolf was tagged with the kanuri proverb
he sees with the eyes only meaning that
the gray stuff was not on the job that he
was too easily fooled by mere appearances
he saw a lamb come to the slaughter and
indulged an extensive grin that displayed
rock-crushing molars proportionate to the
rest of him

  i didnt get your name party he in-
vited as he decorated the bar

  watkins-bill heres a go boys

  adolf noted that bill was very moderate
with the whisky bottle bill noted that
adolf did not treat back he stowed the
notation away and swept wistful eyes over a
green baize table adolf read the sign of
the times saturday night is synonymous
with payroll the long length and narrow
breadth of california it was adolfs busi-
ness to divorce wages from their careless
owners telepathically bill adolf a logger
and an italian artichoke-grower gravitated
to the table

  at  oclock adolf closed the bar and
continued the sessions in the house it was
worth continuing so blessedly goodnatur-
edly did bill watkins loose for that mat-
ter adolf would have been perfectly content
to continue the game for the dollar-per-
jack-pot rake-off to the house and the drink
orders it was the drink orders that made
the first ripple in the serenity of the straw
boss bill fell foul of a distrustful habit
adolf had of gathering up his money before
leaving the table to serve drinks

  nobody aint going to get away with
your pile olson he politely remonstrated

  i dont believe in laying temptation
around too promiscuous grinned adolf
but must have given the point considera-
tion for he went to a door that opened on
stairs and bawled

  alice-alice come down and tend
bar

  presently there appeared a girl with rebel-
lion stamped on her face and expressed in
the laggard movements of her strong supple
body bill accepted the innovation with
patient displeasure covertly eying sizing
her up her face figured around seventeen
but her body had the physical development
of a young woman she could be no rela-
tion of olsen who was as blond as any
savage that came out of the land of the
vikings a brunette with close-cropped
chestnut hair matching eyes that could be

saucy if they had anything to be saucy
over but were now sleepy and angry a
tremulous wilful little mouth and a nose
one couldnt find fault with

  she handled the liquor as she might
handle a dead snake bill fretted inwardly
but managed to throttle his feelings until
along toward  a m when the tired droop
of her body moved him to pull the string for
a mild toot

  this aint no time nor place nor job for a
girl i votes miss alice to bed

  when i want your advise how to run
my business ill ask for it mr watkins
said adolf and thought the call-down got
by so thoughtfully quiet did bill return his
attention to the game

  bill was getting sore on another count be-
sides the girl adolf had won handsomely
and was laying back on his winnings if
the jackpot opened high he couldnt be
tempted in on a pair of aces and when he
was in he checked the bet and if called laid
down a full house or fours with an irritating
display of molars he piled his winnings in
nice orderly piles and had a damnably tan-
talizing way of wolfing the coin with his eyes
and raising them with clumsy-jointed fingers
and shedding them down lingeringly lov-
ingly with a soft metallic click that was
evidently music to his miserly soul

  - growled bill and promptly

apologized to the girl of all the piker
poker-players and ground-hogs id as lief
toss craps with a coon up a back alley

  i aint in this for my health grinned
adolf

  wheres the game if we all lay back
demanded bill

  you aint got nothing to lay back on
adolf argued practically

  youre in it for the game aint you
im in it to win adolf replied with
simple conviction

  bills eyes suddenly lost their humorous
twinkle he pushed back his chair and
shook out cramped legs rising

  well its cost me eighty plunks to get a
line on your play ive got three plunks
to my name and a sorrel to take me home
he picked up three dollars here miss
alice- he pressed the money into her re-
luctant hand-buy yourself a real petti-
coat that gunnysack makeshift dont
belong in this century olsen well adjourn
till next saturday

  he gave the logger and the artichoke
a ward of the state



grower a friendly nod and went to the
stables saddled mounted and rode off
under a sprinkling of morning stars that
tied knots in itself in its steep climb

he did not make the saturday
date the superintendent was
called up to the san francisco office
and he had to be on the job but he got
away at dawn on sunday reaching the road-
house before breakfast riding the sorrel
round to stables he suddenly drew rein on a
startling phenomenon

  alice was at the wash-tub-on sunday
bill thought savagely that however was
not the startling part of it the thing that
made him draw rein and breath was her
action she was wringing a mans under-
shirt-a giants undershirt-in her hands
with a ferocity quite out of keeping with the
blue sabbath skies and green-patched world
of mountain and valley then she savagely
shook it out and in one temper-strengthened
tear ripped it from collar to hem flung it in
the dust under her feet and jumped on it to
the tune of three explosive damns

  now now purred bill that aint
nice-not from a lady

   she swung round her eyes full of fight

  go and mind your own business she
snapped

  she glared at him like a wild animal ten
seconds perhaps then she flung her skirt
over her head exposing a shameless gunny-
sack petticoat and sobbed as if dreams and
romance and joy were come to an end

  bill slid from his saddle and approached
warily

  aw come miss alice he crooned
come now let up just stop a moment
and take a think kind o all in eh
work late at night and early o morning i
guess i know they tried up at the mill to
run in twelve-hour shifts week days and
sundays anjwas always bawling about the
labor problem because the boys lit out
soons they had a stake why dont you
quit

  an answer came muffled through the skirt

  i mustnt theyd catch me and send
me to the correction school im a ward of
the state

  s-o- mused bill gaining time for
ward of the state was something outside of
his experience and comprehension he
took a toothpick from his ear and chewed
thoughtfully on it

  why didnt you buy that petticoat i
gave you the money for he asked by way
of opener

  he- she dropped the skirt from her
stormy face to jerk a thumb toward the
house-is my legal guardian i haveta
give up to him

  well whats eating you this morning
particular kind o all in dont look at
me so all-fired cant you make it out im
your big big brother or say les have a
little make-believe youre cinderella and
im the fairy godmother on the job where
do you hail from

  over to the pescadero mountains

  got relatives there

  an uncle getting out ties

  bill cast away a mangled toothpick and
took another

  mmm and you kept cabin for him
  i ran away

  so-sure you did ran away from the
old woodchopper and his demijohn of dago
red and cusses wanted to see the great
big wide world beyond the mountains kind
of sick of getting it second-hand from
stories eh poor ut girl

   i aint a poor little girl she fired back
with spirit and if i did run away what
business is it of yourn

  when a gal serves licker till morning
and is at the wash-tub before eats its every
mans business i like spirit but dont
overdo it little one maybe if you could
fall for the fairy godmother make-believe
you and me could get together and loosen
olsens clutch-hold on you

  you cant neither hes got awful big
pull he could serve a soldier with liquor
and they wouldnt touch him

so-but how comes the son-of-a-beg
pardon but how comes he your guardian
i ran away dressed like a boy it was
the only way theyre awful mean to girls
thats just bumming round

  i see you got into overalls which it is
felonious for a girl to wear male togs in this
state you was going to see the world and
lits over the county-line and strikes the first
place handy for a job i see the layout
you chops kindling and cleans around a
while then adolf tumbles to your secret and
hauls you before the judge he votes for
yes and the probation officer in-
vestigated uncles and said it was no proper

home for me and they-

  so- softly im wise they make

adventure

adolf your legal guardian and tosses him a
cook wash-girl bed-maker waitress seam-
stress etcetera-not counting the draw a
likely girl is to a road-house-for her board
and keeps and hold over you the correction
school for bad girls if you run away you
sure got a hard-luck spiel miss-i aint
got the other half of your name

  jones

  miss jones youre sure up agin it
but it aint no good tearing up like you was
you was only hurting yourself go easy
leave it to fairy godmother come lets
shake on it

  she let him take her hand her face
brightening like a hurt child who has been
comforted he held the soft little white
hand in his big brown fist as if it were a
fragile cream puff

  mums the word miss alice he cau-
tioned then swung over to the bar

  howdy adolf howdy to the park-
ing gentry around here i am for that
revenge i promised myself adolf you
got me last time but-

  nothing doing said adolf with finality
and grinned

  why-what do you mean you mean
to say you aint going to give me a chance to
even up incredulously

  id be a nice easy sucker wouldnt i to
go up against your coin now youve got the
line of my play scoffed adolf

  bill regarded him much the same as if he
had taken a sharp turn on the mountain
trail and come face to face with an ele-
phant

  youre joshing-sure he presently
remarked

  gotta tend bar adolf sheepishly ex-
cused

  give me something to wash the taste o
that outen my mouth bill demanded
gimme lager

  he gargled his mouth ostentatiously and
banged the glass on the bar

  so- he purred getting a great deal
of real meaning into his favorite mono-
syllable you think youre going to get
by with it olsen take if from me-take
it from bill watkins im going to get it
back on you im going to get it back on you
good and plenty

  i aint worrying none said adolf
easily displaying his crowded gravestones

  no you aint the sense to worry grin
you lug-eared coyote-grin but im giv-

ing you fair-to-warmer warning ill even
up with you

  he went to the stables got the sorrel

mounted and rode off

  next saturday he was back again ap-
parently he had forgotten the matter
adolf thought so adolf received too many
such idle threats that came to nothing to
give it much thought

  youre a good sport bill watkins he
complimented

  oh i dont cry over my medicine
said bill easily

  adolf grinned

bill spent freely during his visit
and between whiles maneuvered
himself into the company of miss
jones the next two week-ends passed
much the same he was laying for adolf
and with the girl to make the visits attrac-
tive he was willing to lay a year or more but
adolf was warming to his free money
quicker than that sooner or later he
would be asking bills advice on something
or the other something would crop up
it was not so fast with the girl

  on the face of it she ought to have been
easily attached to a hundred and fifty per
but was as hard winning as if she were a
daughter of the knickerbocks with the pick
of the land still she was not altogether
discouraging for one thing she exhibited
an interest in bills welfare

  what for do you want to let him get
your money so free over the bar he only
thinks youre easy

  and you dont like such false notions
about me to circulate he teased kind
o humiliating aint it sure he calls me
sucker thats all right ive got to have
some excuse for coming around i aint
yet ready to let him know im out to steal
his ward when are you going to let me
hitch you to a meal-ticket allie

  i havent given it a thought she
flashed

  that night when he was about to saddle
olsen came round to the stables

  bill he said if you hear of any one
wanting to buy a car i can throw a little
commission your way

  thats real kind the chances are i
will and the chances are equal i wont
les have a look at her

  adolf led away to a shack garage and ex-
hibited his wonder
a ward of the state



  i bought her tq run a stage-line through
to half moon bay but there wasnt enough
business i got her on a bargain at eleven
hundred

  youre imagining vain things if you
gave a cent more than eight hundred for her
youd have a lunacy commission sitting on
you whatll you take

  seven hundred

  i didnt ask you what you want but
what youll take

  the tires are almost new and there
aint a scratch on her pursued adolf

  when im buying a hoss i don buy hide
and shoes drawled bill taking a look at
the engine he investigated thoroughly
adolf forestalled the result

  tell you what bill you find me a
sucker at five hundred and ill slip a hun-
ched to you

  bill helped himself to a toothpick an
innocent action but one provocative of
profound thought

  well maybe i hear of a buyer and may-
be i dont lets have that down in writ-
ing

  between friends- began adolf but
shut up at the look in bills eyes all
right

  bill chased a paper bag trundling before
a freaky slap of wind flattened it out and
wrote the agreement which both signed
bill called alice to witness the signatures

  put your name right there under mine
miss jones

  when bill found bimself on the mountain
road he chuckled he had had a prospec-
tive buyer in mind the minute adolf mooted
the sale of the car as he neared the mill he
dropped off to the left and rode down to the
village of boulder creek which lay in per-
petual mountain shadow amidst a paradise
of trickling streams and miniature water-
falls and whose inhabitants put an interpre-
tation on the word business that would
make machiavelli look like a sunday-school
teacher he rode to a general merchandise
store owned by olaf wassel ostensibly to
lay in a stock of smokes and compliment
him on the quality of the last lot of beans
supplied to the mill boarding-house this
however was merely introductory

  didnt you tell me you were selling out
and going to the old country

  sure i got a feller from san francisco
coming down to look over next week

  so-you wanta buy a car



 t- do

  yes you do insinuated bill itll
make the business look that much more
prosperous every successful business man
owns a car nowadays anyways you dont
stand to lose a cent on this deal ill take
the car off your hands and leave you a hun-
dred plunks to the good

  my two ears are wide open wassel
invited suspiciously

  bill took the right one and outlined the
deal olaf listened with pop-eyed de-
light still he had his doubts

  sposing you refuse to take the car off
my hands

  spose i dont know my way about and
done with it scoffed bill isnt the car
my rake-off but whichever way it goes
you stand to win a hundred plunks and risk
nothing

  all right agreed olaf ill drop over
and see my countryman

  oh sure purred bill as if the point
were new to him he is a countryman of
yours-o course

  his next move was to call on judge
oppenheim this was after the monday
evening whistle blew oppenheims mani-
fold activities were set forth in enamelled
lettering on the front window-insurance
wills bequests collections attainders mort-
gages loans therefore it was perfectly
superfluous of bill to ask him if he were open
to make a bit of side-money

 far be money from my aching
thoughts smirked oppenheim

  then give ear to this layout of mine
and wise me if its a legal cinch said bill
and laid out the lines of his pleasing plot

  oppenheim heard him to the end his
moon-face flat and empty as a clean dinner-
plate suffused his best approach to a
grin

  there isnt a judge would hesitate five
minutes in finding in your favor its
hidebound hell bring suit of course
you retain me i take it

  you take it right oppy s long

three evenings later bills soul
was delighted to see a nicely pol-
ished car with almost new tires
standing before the store he thought
wassel might have let him know that the
deal was gone through he reserved a
thought about it as he entered the store
hows she coming olaf


adventure

  fine and dandy that frisco fellerll
be down to take stock sunday and monday
ill keep the car around till ive turned
over

  attaboy agreed bill and wassell was
beautifully deceived when you leav-
ing

  thursday i guess ill hand the car
over to you wednesday night and take your
hundred dollars eh

  bill nodded but outside indulged in a
short soliloquy

  yes you will you will but you dont
think you will

  saturday he climbed the serpentine
mountain road again to the road-house
adolfs welcoming grin was a yard wide

  i put the deal through with the feller
you sent over ill owe you a hundred
plunks

  whats the matter with not getting out
of debt right now

  i aint collected yet partys a little
shy on ready money gave me two notes for
two-fifty each due at seven and fourteen
days

  good biz purred bill aright i
guess i can wait for mine have a smile-
everybody

  he nodded toward the brass-rail foot-
polishers flung down a coin grabbed liis
drink and slipped out round to the kitchen
door and imitated the liquid call of the
meadow lark to its soulmate by fortunate
coincidence alice had occasion right there-
after to empty a dish-pan in the yard
bills eyes twinkled but he was too wise to
ask if anything was the matter with the
sink

  allie im coming over in my car next
week to take you out youll want some
fixings little one unless youre not agin
marrying in a gunnysack petticoat

  i havent any idea of marrying in mind
short and quick

  life philosophized bill is like a
mountain road we never know what were
meeting round the bend

  his eyes wolfed her and he seemed hard
put to it to control his empty arms

  she backed away a little whispering
objection

  he wont never let me-go out riding
hes my legal guardian

  leave it to your fairy godmothers
magic wand to dissipate those objections
crowed bill and took a step toward her

allie he began on a softer note allie

  bill she interjected with scary quick-
ness i got to get supper

  she flashed to the kitchen

  events crowded bills existence next
week tuesday night he dropped into the
store at boulder creek t see how the
frisco buyer was making out he put it
wassel was packing his grips also he was
shaved when a man shaves on a mid-
week night hes off to the city in the morning
or hes sitting on a coroners jury was
bills observation but he kept it to him-
self

  see you tomorrow night olaf he said
significantly of the bargain to hand over
the car then and swung out glanced cau-
tiously around then slipped to the shed that
served for garage glided in and opened the
valves of all four tires

  thatll keep him busy if mayhap i
dont hear the alarum go off in the morn-
ing he told himself its a cinch he
wont try out that wriggly mountain road
at nighttime with a car he aint familiar
with

  but he did hear the alarum and was up
saddled and riding down to the store as
dawn struck the mountain skyline even
at that wassel was earlier the machine
stood before the store on four hard tires
with wassels grips on the rear seat and
wassel himself about to flit bills eyes
twinkled

  was you borrowing my car for a trip to
city olaf thats aright if only youd
mentioned it beforehand

  your car blustered wassel since
when i got a perfectly good bill of sale
on that car

  so- in that soft caressing tone that
conveyed gentle remonstrance persuasion
lurking warning invitation to sit down hip-
to-hip and talk reasonably ive brought
my hundred dollars cording to agreement
and i take back the car or sick olsen on to
you for security for those notes before you
lit out just tumble them grips out
wassel and dont try to pull any fool
stuff

wassel grimaced but saw that bill had
the drop on him they went into the house
and fixed up a bill of sale which bill stowed
in his vest pocket with adolfs bill of sale to
wassel then hitched the sorrel to the car
cranked and drove off the sorrel waltzing
a ward of the state



on its hind legs passing the superin-
tendents bungalow he saw goodyear hand-
ing his wife into their car for an early run up
to city he stopped to goodyears hail

  whats the layout bill-training the
sorrel for circus

  nope im bribing a girl to give me a
little of her company off and on between the
lure of city frivolities returned bill dig-
ging at the notorious fact that goodyear
only held wife and job together by the bribe
of an eight cylinder that brought the city
within a few hours run

  he addressed the pampered doll in the
car

  would it be trespassing on your kind-
ness mrs goodyear to do a little buying
for me in the city

  delighted what brand do you chew
bill ignored the idleness he was too dead
in earnest

  id like for you to get a nice warm fur
coat like youre wearing and a hat to go
along with it and something smart in the
way of petticoats

  who is she bill was the instant
feminine cry

  goodyear echoed the question

  where dye find her bill

  thats neither here nor there

  well-what is she like persisted mrs
goodyear give me a line to go on in my
buying

  i hate to crow one woman over another
bill answered with simple sincerity

  mrs goodyear laughed

  but i must know what she is like
youll-shell want a bit of color in the hat
is she dark or fair tall or short stout or
slender eyes black brown or blue

  bill drew a toothpick from his ear started
to put it between his teeth remembered he
was talking to a lady tossed it away
frowned and lined up all his gray matter on
the job

  shes kind o dainty not quite your size

-pretty her eyes are-

  stars out of the sky bubbled mrs
goodyear her feet are posies she has
the grace of a fawn and her smile is like
moonlight on an azure lake oh bill
youve taken it bad come down to earth
crazy man and give me facts how much
shall i spend-how far shall i go

  go the limit he roared but qualified it
down to two to three hundred

  mrs goodyear laughed a little enviously

 very good but i simply must know
what she is like-what would suit her

  i aint no hand describing wimmin
bill confessed but out of despair came
inspiration whats the matter with you
stopping at the road-house just over the
county-line and seeing her yourself peek
into the kitchen

  oh bill you arent taking to wife a girl
working at a road-house she shrilly pro-
tested you could do ever so much better
than- she pulled up on a danger-signal
in his eyes all right shall it be c o d
or shall i start a charge account

 better open an account shell be
wanting to send up once in a while for
something

  he wiped his brow over the ordeal as she
shot off he met goodyears grin belliger-
ently but the superintendent was out
to grease the matrimonial wheels

  you can have the bungalow next the
accountants bill anxiously im trusting
to your good judgment to select a lady
were a small society here and the wrong
kind can make a heap of trouble

  dont worry jim lots of good rock
lies in unlikely places

  youd better spare a couple of men from
your gang to fix the bungalow up a bit
you can draw on the storekeeper for neces-
saries-bill dont bust us

  bill went off with a satisfactory feeling
that the worst part of the business of getting
married was over

  he settled into the routine joyously an-
ticipating friday when olsen would hop
along to collect on the first note he
expected adolf to suffer a disappointment
he expected him to bring his disappoint-
ment to the quarry he expected adolf to
be raging and chewed a peck of toothpicks
in blissful satisfaction

friday forenoon passed without
excitement in the afternoon they
were blasting through a sus-
pended cloud of fine dust squat swarthy
mexicans and italians showed against the
cement rock like roaches on a kitchen wall
humped on narrow ledges shaking to the
tremendous vibrations of gattling electric
drills that shrilled and screamed like a
battle then drills and feeding wires were
drawn away to safety power charges were
tamped home whilst bill ran connecting
wires for the electric spark


adventure

  bill always saw to this work personally
he took no chances on misfires and the risk
of collecting men in instalments and de-
priving a mother back in sunny italy of her
monthly p o it was very particular work
so he was somewhat nettled that adolf
should choose that moment to intrude two
hundred and thirty pounds of volcanic rage
into the scenery yes adolf had mislaid
his heathenish grin down in an interview
with the new owner of the store below

  that feller wassel has lit out he
shrieked waving a piece of paper with a
face-value of two hundred and fifty dollars
but which wouldnt have lost him a cent
if he had put a match to it

   bill finished his work

  stand back everybody he roared
squat men-shapes dropped from the
cliffs face and ran doubled with arms
shielding heads and ear-drums to safety
he ran to the controlling switch blundering
adolf and his bit of paper out of his path

  stand clear you fool he hissed or
youll never wake up to know what hap-
pened to you

  a couple of gesticulating italians tried to
convey the same warning

  hit him with a rock yelled bill waiting
to throw the switch

   one of the fellows took the order literally
adolf ran bill swung the tin switch a
terrific explosion tore off the face of the cliff
before the echoes had died out of the rever-
berating mountains the laborers were swing-
ing picks to clear the runway for the dump
cars

  bill slipped a toothpick between his lips
and turned to adolf

  did you wish to see me about some-
thing adolf

  that feller wassel has lit out for the old
country screamed the frantic swede

  so-but why the excitement he dont
owe me anything

  hes a crook you knew he was a
crook

  well drawled bill i cant say im
surprised but you aint so strong on
sunday-school sentiments yourself whats
your kick

  hes done me up im stuck with five
hundred dollars on bad notes

  you dont say i take it you took his
notes unsecured that was mighty care-
less of you adolf you disappoint me
grievously i thought you was a real on-

the-dot business man you sure gave me
the notion in a little poker sitting that you
was right there with the goods too bad
chirped bill with not so much sympathy in
tone as the words might imply

  he drew off and gave adolf a profound
quizz as if there was something unfamiliar
about him

  you seem changed adolf i cant
quite-yes i got it youve lost your grin
too bad you wasnt half so homely with
it as you are without it

  you fixed this up with him bellowed
olsen youre both crooks

  so-easy adolf easy not so loud
around here im ticklish about my repita-
tion if you took unsecured notes that was
plumb foolish im real sorry i wasnt there
at the dicker to teach you the simple rudi-
ments o business lemme see how we
stand i got to collect a hundred commis-
sion aint it

  adolf fell back on his mother tongue for
curses sufficiently explosive and deep to
ventilate his rage

  you dont get a cent youve got my
car ill go get it

  well youre steering your own ship o
course but dont bite off moren you kin
chew seems to me i got your bill-of-sale
to olaf and one from him to me and that
notion of yours looks very ugly like grand
larceny

  ill file an attachment on the car ill
attach your salary ill have the law on
you you crook yelled adolf

  so- softly dont get et up about
it ill drop over in my car tomorrow
night and see how you make out like to
look over the mill whilst youre here its
interesting to see the machinery grind and
burn the rock and bag it weve got a
patent bagger that cost an inventive
genius a whole lot of hard thinking ill
show you around what-you gotta go
slong then

  his eyes twinkled happily to see adolf
stumble away in blind rage his great feet
stubbing strewn boulders like a great
hulking viking reeling from lost battle
stopping every now and then to turn and
shake a huge fist and imprecate in his
mother tongue

  when whistle blew bill dropped down
to the sheriffs cottage

  howdy jim whats in it for you to
serve an attachment
a ward of the state



  three-fifty

  so-thats disappointing i sure thought
i was throwing more than that your way
youll be pasting an attachment on my car
and putting one on my salary a measly
seven dollars

  unless the case is hung up when theres
a new attachment on your salary each
month

  bill slapped his knee with joyous in-
spiration he was on the monthly payroll
with other department heads notwithstand-
ing his weekly visits to adolph which he
financed in a frenzied way by advance
drawings on his salary or borrowings-that
is when the poker game hit him hard in
the first saturday of the month he told
the sheriff he would get the cashier at the
mills to shift him temporarily to the weekly
payroll of the laborers which would put
adolph to the necessity of making a fresh
attachment every week to the financial
betterment of the sheriff then he went
on to judge oppenheims

  oppy that feller has bitten and bitten
hard

  hes suing

  betcher hes suing

  when do you want the case set

  no hurry were pretty busy up at the
mills on a government contract also
theres a bit girl involved as aint yet on to
her own mind say a couple o months
ill see to it but hell tie up your
wages

  sure he promised that suits me
make me save up something to git spliced
on by the way you will counter-sue for a
hundred dollars commission and whilst
youre on the job shoot through a damage
claim for my pecuniary loss consequent on
him tying up my salary and injury to my
repitation i understand loser pays at-
torneys fees witnesses mileage and sundry
expenses

  it is customary if the winners case is
strong and ill wager the judgell reach a
verdict favorable to you on all counts
without leaving the bench

  you know the law of it oppy tune
her up figure strong on the injury to my
repitation and the nervous torture im
going through blandly im losing
weight dreadful oppy the doctor is
piling up a bill agin me i cant sleep im
that nervous i cant touch giant powder
im likely to lose my job im hit hard

oppy in my tenderest feelings-in my repi-
tation he called me a crook oppy right
out before the boys i could ha dropped in
my tracks fer shame hes dragging me in-
to court im all broken up and-

  get out of here you roaring mountain
lion laughed oppenheim

  next morning bill put an italian to
polishing the car for the evening trip but
stacked up against a disappointment
goodyear said he was called up to the city
office bill more than suspected that a
yearning for mrs goodyear was behind
the call for the lady had not yet returned
still he could not kick particularly as he
had a hunch he might want the superin-
tendent to spell him for a couple of days in
the near future if his intentions got by with
alice

monday morning the sheriff
served the attachments bill was
as gay over it as if he had received a
present the same evening goodyear and
his wife drove in she brought a fur coat a
hat-box and half a dozen petticoats and a
charge slip that would have flattened out
any one but bill or a millionaire with a
loveless home treating his stenog but he
thought of saturday and grinned fate
however in the shape of adolfs attorney
moved the presentation two days nearer

  thrifty adolf had seen to the simple
business of filing the attachments without
incurring attorneys expenses confident
that he was merely calling bills bluff it
was not till he was served with summonses
on the counter-suits that he woke up to
where he stood and took a scary flight into
san mateo to consult an attorney who took
something less than ten minutes to discover
that his client was in bad all round

  you took the notes in payment on the
car and gave bill of sale the responsibility
was on you to see that the notes were se-
cured you havent a leg to stand on
watkinss commission stands good and his
damage claim against you looks to dig a big
hole in your bank account your best way
out of a bad mess is to let me see his attor-
ney and try for a compromise

  but they worked a crooked game on
me whined adolf

  that is presumptive but hard to prove
i wouldnt be too noisy about that if i
were you

  is that the law adolf demanded


adventure

fiercely as if law had suddenly assumed
cloven hoofs and horns

  certainly

  adolf howled he ripped america and
american jurisprudence up and down like a
true hyphenate until the attorney quietly
stopped him

  dont abuse the hospitality of the coun-
try that is giving you home and livelihood
as for your case i would jeopardize my
standing by taking it into court which by
the way would be in santa cruz and i must
remind you that your pull stops at the
county-line ill try and effect a compro-
mise in a friendly way though it looks to me
as if this watkins had it in for you

  why should he i aint never done him
dirt declared adolf with simple belief

  well a man in his position would be on
the staff payroll at the mills yet hes draw-
ing weekly salary with the laborers to put
you to the expense of a weekly attachment
i deduce

  the low-down skunk

  possibly but calling names isnt help-
ing you are you for a compromise

  i gotta be aint i snapped adolf
you bring him over to the road-house and
ill spill a little licker to mellow the talk
he nicely arranged

  accordingly bill was called from the
beanery thursday noon to the phone
oppenheim was on the line he had had a
confab over the wires with adolfs attorney
who invited all parties to the road-house that
night for an amicable settlement

  well said bill id as lief take it to
court only the swede has one draw on me
he aint yet wise to he might lug out his
legal guardianship to a bit girl and spring a
straight-flush on me ill pick you up in
the car about  oclock

  he went to goodyear

  jim i got a little law business to see to
this evening and maybe after ill want to
slip up to city for a few days

  and youre not going lonesome all
right bill saunders can fill your shoes
though hell sky-high our workmens in-
surance premiums good luck

  a little after four he swung out on the
tortuous mountain road in a sixty-dollar
suit that had seen daylight but twice in a
years possession his chin as smooth as the
mill barber could make it hair cut and laid
away on each side from a center line with
weighting bay rum his face ferocious with

determination to bring to a show-down the
worst tangle in his career a tangle that had
but minor connection with the compromise

  gals is funny things he confided to
oppenheim

  bill id take it with real relief if you
could budge your mind off girls and put it in
that steering-gear this trip opined the at-
torney as they swung round a sharp bend
and hung a wheel a thrilling moment over a
sheer drop of a thousand feet

  keep your eye on those bundles on the
back seat better take the hat-box on your
knees was all the satisfaction he got

  he shot round the road-house to the yard
the san mateo attorneys rig was there

  you go in oppy and stall along for a
few moments said bill grabbing the
bundles and making stealthy steps to the
kitchen

  the ward of the state was up to her ears
in pots and pans so busy she did not hear
the screen door at her back bill stood
rooted on the temptation of four inches of
pretty neck showing under a close-cropped
head and down to a gingham before he
had found his courage she had found him

  hullo allie he grinned think i was
gone back on you cause i wasnt around
last saturday

  i didnt think anything about it
she pouted a little too readily to carry
conviction

  didnt cry-not a teeny bit teased
bill

  cry because there was one big mouth
less to peel talers for

  well i aint here to make you blush
confessions he brazened dumping his
arm-load on a chair your fairy god-
mothers sent you some glad duds and
theres a buzz wagon outside thatll put it
all over the coach-and-six stuff you and
me are headed for one big streak of joy-
ride

  speak for yourself she flashed holding
a sloppy dish-rag for self-defense so hungry
were his eyes then in a quick change of
mood-he wont let me go

  leave me to take care of that end
here-

  he advanced and pried the dish-rag from
her fingers and drew her two arms out
straight and loaded on the bundles topping
them with the hat-box

  you go up-stairs and get into those duds
then take the front seat in our car and
a ward of the state



leave it all up to godmothers magic wand
  but she was still fighting

  our car i havent any strings on your
car bill watkins

  allie said bill with cool insolence
if you stand there back-sassing and looking
so pretty ill just grab you to the car as you
are and joy-ride in gingham

  she flashed him a look decided he was
capable of carrying out the threat and fled

hr- bill walked round to the bar
he found the two attorneys skir-
mishing the preliminaries and big
adolf trying to look happy

  glad to see you bill adolf tooted
blandly

  youre a durned liar youd as lief see
old harry

  adolf had to swallow that

  have a smile

  im here strictly on business

  y-e-s adolf pushed hesitatingly off
his thick lips what are you going to do
about it

  me i aint doing nothing im laying
back on my winnings which i figure around
a mighty good second-hand car a hundred
plunks commission and what we agree on
to balm my injured repitation and expenses
o course

  adolf tried to grin but succeeded only in
manufacturing an expression about twice as
sad as a deserted seashore at murmuring
low tide with the sun sinking over the rim of
a sad world and a chilly breeze stealing in
when he spoke his words seemed cloyed
with an acre of entangling kelp notwith-
standing their effrontery

  im willing to drop suit and to allow you
the hundred commission for the return of
my car

  your car where dye get that stuff
wake up adolph

  the latters attorney got in hurriedly on
the soft pedal

  my client mr watkins recognizes that
he was overhasty and ill-advised

  yep bill adolf chirped in you got

to allow you wasnt doing no friendly-

  friendly blazed bill it was busi-
ness ugh his hand sought his right
ear for a toothpick then he remembered the
barbering friendly if the shoe was
on the other foot youd be about as friend-

ly as a ravenous coyote with a rabbit
adolf muttered something about a square
deal and put his foot right into it

  you gave miss jones a square deal eh-
you gorilla-faced piker have you brought
me over from the mountains to spill baby
talk wake up to the game youre sitting
in on the stakes are on the table the
car and my commission aint in it at all
im betting withdrawal of my suit for
damages to repitation and pecuniary loss
against your legal consent to the marriage
of miss alice jones

  adolf howled blustered plead threat-
ened all the inhumane authority of the hu-
mane and probation laws bellowed cursed

  bill raised up on his toes and squinted
over the swinging doors to the bar a
saucy toque with a lilac cluster first met his
gaze then a pretty ear the collar of a fur
coat and the barest tip of a pretty nose

  some rustler eh he enthused real
quick-change artist you lose there adolf
aint she the lady though

  adolf renewed his howls and bellows and
bluster

  well said bill if youre going to
take it like that theres nothing for me
but to steal the jack-pot he turned to
oppenheim oppy ill leave you to get
sense into his fool head and to get him to
drive you back to boulder

  oh hell see daylight when he cools off
the attorney prophesied perhaps when
i get him to see the unpleasant position of
his friend the probation officer in probating
a girl to a road-house hell see he hasnt
much of a squeal good luck bill
attaboy

  bill swung out cranked thought to him-
self it wouldnt be long before he had an
electric starter sprang to the wheel and
shot away in a swirl of dust

  there aint no ball nor glass slippers nor
handsome prince to this trip cinderella he
crooned softly to the little fur-cuddled
silent figure by his side but ill show you
a bigger chunk of the world than you yet
saw and maybe well take in a show or two
and kind o general- aw allie girl say
something i aint rushing you into this
the reply came in a half-whisper but
spirited

  you couldnt rush me into anything if i
wasnt willing bill

n the bright lexicon of tom
fleming there was no such
word as moderation it simply
didnt exist

 tom dwelt in a superlative world where
every child with a stomach-ache was a case
of arsenic poisoning every poor shaver
who nicked himself during the daily
massacre an attempted black hand out-
rage the beggar who panhandled him
on the street was a foreign spy the ol-clos
man who bought his worn-out suits was a
russian duke in exile in other words
tom was the horrible by-product of the
movies

 the red-letter day of toms life had been
the time he met mullaney mullaney was
an honest - to - goodness detective -tom
would have spelt that word in capital letters
this occasion had come about when
mullaney had dropped into the real-estate
office where tom was employed as salesman
mullaney was on the trail of a gentleman
who had been over-lavish with other
peoples signatures

 after the business in hand had been
disposed of tom ventured the question
which had been hovering on his tongue
for minutes

  have a drink

  mullaney would it seemed and over a
gin fizz was confided the young mans secret
ambition

  mullaney bore up under the news well
he was stoical-pessimistic even exam-
ining the three-star brand in his hand with
the squinted eye of a connoisseur he gave
vent to the opinion that sleuthing wasnt
what it was cracked up to be in fact he
spoke slightingly of the profession the very
name of which fired toms imagination to
the explosive point but the young fellow
was not dashed this was his chance and
he was going to grasp it

  honestly id give most anything to
get in it he said earnestly say any
time you have anything sort of extra-
where you can use another man-an out-
sider you know tip me off id be tickled
to death to do anything i-ill stop at no
danger he added a little ashamed of the
dramatic phrasing even as it came out

  mullaney said hed remember it and
didnt tom think that they served extra-
small glasses in that place

  the funny part of it is that he did
remember it toms mental horizon was
suddenly flooded with the purple and gold

is
emeralds and blondie



of romance when he met the detective one
night upon leaving the office the sleuth
delivered his proposition in a bored manner
which in no wise dampened the young mans
ardor

  say if you were on the level about
wanting to bust into the game as an extra
heres something and remember you aint
offending me none if you turn it down
read about this gaddis-neville wedding
thats coming off this evening up here at
the st stephen hotel well theres going
to be a bunch of people there and they
want some men to watch the wedding
presents they left it to me to round
them up and i thought of you theres
five bones in it for you if you want to take
a chance

  if he wanted to toms heart action
increased alarmingly five dollars would
only pay for his laundry to be sure-but the
color the chance for adventure-to be a
real live detective for a night the phleg-
matic mr mullaney narrowly escaped being
hugged

   got a dress-suit was the first fly in the
ointment

  toms face dropped a couple of feet

  oh gee no-but say i can hire one

  thatll do agreed mullaney sadly
were to mosey around in the crush and
sorta keep an eye on things there aint
really much sense to it nothingll happen
nothing ever does nobody with brains
would lift the stuff they give at these
weddings its tinfoil mostly but if theyre
willing to pay i aint hired to teach em
you hire one of those curse you suits
and show up at the st stephen at 
theres four of us-youll find me in the
hall where the wedding is going to be
pulled off

  tom was walking on air when he and the
hired dress-suit reached the bay-windowed
dingy gray house out on ofarrell street
which in sentimental moments he called
home san francisco is full of such houses
left standing since before the fire all
of the vintage of the os all relics of
broken-down-aristocracy fallen upon evil
days tom occupied what he flippantly
referred to as cell number one the one-
time front parlor and kitchenette tucked
into a former clothes-closet and officially
known as the first suite of housekeeping
rooms

  he ran up the high wooden steps and

was reaching for his latch-key when the
door was flung open and some one rushing
impetuously out collided against him with
such neatness and dispatch that the hired
dress-suit went flying down the steps behind
him

  ugh he exclaimed and was about to
add that classic advice about watching
your step when he recognized his collidee
so to speak she was the pretty blonde
who had the rear room on the second floor

  the girl had been flung back against the
ugly wooden banister of the hall stairs
her hat knocked over her straight little
nose and a long silky strand of hair jolted
loose from under its brim

  at any other time tom would have
welcomed the episode he had wanted-
unsuccessfully-to meet helen mercer ever
since he had seen her moving into the house
two weeks ago even now he forgot his
role of the cool keen-eyed sleuth long
enough to crush the rescued dress-suit
under his arm and say with embarrassed
sincerity

  oh i say miss mercer im awfully
sorry i havent hurt you have i

  the girl tilted the broad-rimmed hat
back from her nose and caught her breath
with a little gasp even before she spoke
toms eyes flooded with wonder the girl
was not only startled as would be natural
under the circumstances she was fearful
her gray eyes looking out from a face gone
white with fright

  instinctively following her gaze tom
saw the reason her heavy gray overcoat
had been hastily pulled on and left un-
buttoned their late encounter had flung
it open to reveal a radiant vision of a golden
dress its top flounce looped with row upon
row of expensive pearls it was an evening
dress-and a dress incongruous with the
modest hat and the inexpensive gray coat

  this much he saw and the girl spas-
modically jerked the coat closed and cov-
ered the telltale golden mass her laugh
was strained and the color still absent from
the smooth cheeks

  no oh no im not hurt a bit it-it
was stupid of me but i was in a hurry and
i didnt look before i opened the door

  she gave him a smile still tremulous and
fled precipitously down the outer steps
leaving a very much perturbed and puzzled
young man looking after her

  tom unlocked the door of his own chilly


adventure

domain the neglected dress-suit still
crushed under one arm his keen young
eyes had narrowed reflectively that as-
tute sense of the fitness of things was
whispering suspiciously to him again here
was an incongruity which he could not
account for

  it occupied his mind while he dressed
what was the answer anyway he asked
his reflection as he put on his collar before
the mirror why should the girl be so
startled because her coat had flown open
suppose he had seen her evening dress
lots of girls who worked wore them still
there was something funny about it that
dress was no eighteen-fifty bargain prize
even to his inexperienced eyes

  why the pearls alone must have cost her
a couple of hundred dollars if they went
all around the flounce in the same lavish
fashion with which they decorated the front
if she could afford a dress like that why
didnt she have a hat and coat to match
and-even more logical-why did she live
in housekeeping rooms in this dingy
ofarrell street house

  a glance at the alarm clock balanced
perilously on the edge of the bureau post-
poned the solution of this problem until a
more convenient time it was fifteen
minutes after eight mullaney had said to
be there at  pretty helen mercer and
her mysterious golden dress were relegated
to the background of toms mind and
detective fleming fairly leaped into his
overcoat and ran down the steps

h

by  tom was willing to
admit that the pessimistic mullaney
was right when he ventured the
prediction that nothingll happen not-
withstanding the fact that he obediently
mingled with the guests and kept a con-
scientious eye on the tableful of wedding
presents he knew in his heart that no light-
fingered gentry who was not light-headed
at the same time would attempt to get
away with the massive but comparatively
inexpensive silver which formed the bulk
of the gifts

  for the first couple of hours the thought
of being there at all at recognizing celeb-
rities who had been mere newspaper names
to him heretofore the kaleidoscopic color
the tintinnabulating music the heated

perfumed air had all served to keep his
imagination up to the romantic pitch

  then it began to cloy his adventurous
spirits flagged in proportion as his feet
began to hurt the rooms seemed stuffy
the crowd and babble about him seemed
purposeless he didnt blame mullaney
for not being more enthusiastic about his
job if this was all that detecting amounted
to gosh if something would only happen
if some one would only attempt to stagger
out under the cumbersome cut-glass punch-
bowl if the orchestra leader would only
choke the host even the wedding left his
imagination cold

  the bride looked nervous and stringy
tom decided with the sweeping bluntness
of youth that the groom was a big boob
he started to yawn as he walked for the
forty-eighth time about the room when
some instinct within him caused him to bite
the yawn in the middle and straighten up
much as a terrier pricks up his ears at the
first whiff of trouble

  in the further corner by the orchestra
an agitated little knot of people had
clustered and even through the barbaric
beat of the music a womans voice hyster-
ically raised caused the dancers in her
vicinity to turn curious heads then he
saw her-an under-dressed stout woman
magnificently upholstered in mauve

  tom was starting over with all of an
irishmans delight in a coming row when
he was checked by the sight of mullaney
worming his way through the crowd toward
him there was concern on mullaneys
face for the first time in the memory of man
he drew the young man aside behind a
group of potted palms which concealed the
entrance to a small marble anteroom

  listen fleming the detectives voice
was low but ominously grim theres a
grand little party on and its up to us to
make good somebodys got away with a
twenty-thousand-dollar emerald necklace
this chetwynd dame-

  tom interrupted his hazel eyes snapping
with excitement

  the chetwynd emeralds

  he was making a desperate effort to
appear blase and accustomed to this sort
of thing but in spite of himself a tremulous
delight sounded through his tone

 yep mullaney swept on seems
she had em up to a couple o minutes ago
she remembers feeling the clasp to make sure
emeralds and blondie



they were all right next thing she knew
they were gone right under our noses
too theres such a mob here theres only
one thing to do make every one give an
account of themselves-make sure they
got a right to be here then search em
theyll crab their heads off too he inter-
jected grimly you watch this door-
i got men watching every other one and
then well spring the surprise party on the
crowd if any one tries to beat it out of
here nab em theyll be the one who
did it

  he gave the young fellow a shove toward
the floor of the little anteroom and hurried
back to the group across the room which
had already swelled to twice its original
size and was steadily drowning out the
orchestra

  all suspicion of ennui was gone from
toms manner now he was as alert as a
bloodhound on a criminals trail some-
thing had happened at last he was to be
an actor in a real jewel robbery what
unbelievably good luck

  a searching glance around the anteroom
proved it empty the miniature forest of
palms concealed it from the view of the
main ballroom it was a pretty little am-
bush whose marble walls draped in chinese
blue velvet hangings had listened to many
intimate conversations a wicker settee
carefully limited to two was the only
furniture from this little retreat a side
entrance led to the rear hall of the hotel and
fixing this door with his eyes tom flung
himself on the settee to follow orders

  the babble of the ballroom had grown
to a hubbub which suddenly gave way to
an ominous hush tom could hear the
hosts voice explaining the loss of the
emeralds interrupted hysterically by the
excited owner of the necklace

  a guests voice no doubt assisted by the
astute mr mullaney rather pompously
proposed that every one be searched in
order to put their minds at rest and offered
himself as the first candidate

  upon this the babble broke out anew
again tom his ears strained to miss no
part of this drama into which he was so
suddenly thrust was wishing that he had
been assigned a position more in the midst
of things he was even growing a trifle
resentful at mullaney for putting him in this
neglected station when a stealthy footstep
outside on the marble floor caused him to

prick up his ears terrior-fashion once more
then slip noiselessly behind an outjutting
angle of the wall

  a hand wormed whitely between the
blue curtains hanging in the archway they
swayed apart ever so slightly and a figure
slid into the room for a moment tom
listened in silence to the frightened breath-
ing of the intruder then before the curtain
had stopped its slight swaying he stepped
out to confront the fugitive

  the surprise was fifty-fifty he found
himself staring blankly back into the terri-
fied gray eyes of helen mercer

  for a long moment the young man could
do no more than fix his gaze speechlessly
on the slim golden form outlined against
the dull blue background of the curtain
the girls face was chalky so white that the
gray eyes seemed almost black in contrast
and the pupils spread nearly to the rim
of the iris one hand was convulsively
pressed to her pounding heart crushing the-
pearls on the bodice regardlessly

  at the sight of the young man the
muscles in her throat twitched spasmod-
ically once then she went so limp that he
was afraid she was going to faint

  miss mercer what are you doing
here

  tom tried to make his voice severe but
the sight of that drooping figure appealed
to him in spite of himself

  strangely enough after the first surprise
the recognition of the young man seemed
to brace the girl a long slow shudder
shook her from head to foot then she sud-
denly galvanized into life

  mr fleming oh im so glad its you
youll help me wont you ive got to
go-ive got to they-theyre searching
them out there and they mustnt find me
youll let me run wont you before they
find me here ill explain to you tomorrow
-but ive got to go now

  even as she spoke she had run to the
deep-silled window and pulling the velvet
hanging impatiently aside had snatched up
the familiar gray coat and the broad-
rimmed hat tom had seen her wear a few
hours ago in such different surroundings

  wait a minute

  toms voice checked the girl as she
frantically plunged her arms in the sleeves

  miss mercer you mustnt do that
maybe you dont know whats the trouble
but mrs chetwynds emerald necklace is


adventure

gone im guarding this door to see that
no one gets out to see that the person
who stole it has no chance to escape he
finished his keen eyes narrowed on the
girls face

  but i didnt take it how could i-
i dont even know what it looks like i
never saw mrs chetwynd until tonight
oh mr fleming please i can explain it all
but i havent time now and im afraid to
stay ill meet you tomorrow tonight-
any time you say and tell you why but ive
got to go now

  she had flown to him and was tugging
at his arm her face vivid with excitement
her breath coming fearfully through parted
lips in the soft radiance of the golden
dress with her hair in silky confusion about
her upturned face she was as appealing as
a child who has been caught in mischief
and begs to be shielded toms boyish
heart almost groaned aloud

  miss mercer cant you see what youre
making me think if you carry on this way
if you dont know anything about the neck-
lace why are you afraid of being searched
because i dont belong here-they dont
know me-i wasnt invited the girl was in
a frenzy of impatience

  tom continued his soul tom in doubt
i wondered about you tonight why you
had a dress like this and still lived in that
old house and how you were able to come
to a place like this-but after all thats
your own affair-but this trying to run
away like this cant you see i mustnt let
you do that no matter how sorry i
am

  oh dear i havent time to stop to
explain now mr fleming you must know
that i didnt take it you know i wouldnt
steal anything let alone a necklace theyd
be sure to find if i did

  tom was in an agony of uncertainty it
was hard to think consecutively with that
pleading face raised to his the eyes
shining like twin gray stars in their anxiety
the girls voice sank to a little choked
whisper

  you know im telling the truth please
let me go before its too late i can explain

everything but-oh please-

  her body froze in sudden terror at foot-
falls outside on the marble floor and tom
found himself forced to make a decision

  the young mans forehead was creased
painfully

  oh gee he burst forth i hate to

throw mullaney down-but-

  a second step caused him to speak in a
rapid tone

  miss mercer did any one see you come
in here

  no no no

  new hope had come into the girls eyes
she shook her head so positively that the
pale golden mass on the top was threatened
with downfall

  all right tom exploded hurry up
before any one sees you

  he saw the girl catch her breath in relief
her cold little hand suddenly gripped his
and the next moment she had slipped out
the hall door

  tom walked back to the settee fighting
an inward battle why did this have to
happen to catch the real thief that
would have been a glorious adventure
but to have to choose for no apparent reason
between his word to mullaney and the
chance of getting helen mercer in trouble-
it seemed so unnecessary

  well it wasnt such a dreadful deed after
all he told himself the real thief would
be discovered and he would have saved the
girl from whatever indiscretion she was
afraid might be revealed

yit was nearly an hour later when
mullaney looking a trifle worn and
worried entered the anteroom to
find a glum young amateur detective await-
ing him tom looked up eagerly

  well who did it

  mullaneys tone was morose no less
morose were the faces of pendleton gaddis
and the owner of the necklace close behind
him

  no luck snapped the detective
whoever did it got away somehow
darned if i know how either every ones
accounted for and ive had men guarding
every entrance whoever stole that neck-
lace is the slickest proposition i ever
heard of

  his words trickled like drops of cold
water on toms conscience then she
must have taken it helen mercer with
those wide gray eyes of hers that appealing
innocent face and those pleading little
hands the little cat-the little sneak-
to deliberately play on his feelings she
must have had it all the time she was
working him for an easy fool and behind
emeralds and blondie



those earnest eyes she was probably laugh-
ing at him the thought was almost un-
bearable

  with one blow she had wounded the
young man in his professional pride and
in something deeper-something tenderly
protective which had leaped to life for her
that moment she had stood looking up at
him so trustingly

  mullaneys words broke in on the
seething indignation within him the de-
tectives tone was weary tom felt a loyal
pity for him he knew what this would
mean to him in a professional sense

  you didnt see any one did you
fleming no one tried to come through

  even as the young man opened his lips
to reply he seemed to feel again that cold
little hand slip over his the pleading
gray eyes floated between him and the
strained faces before him

  you know i wouldnt steal any-
thing-

  it was helens voice clear as a crystal in
his brain

  his fingers knotted until the veins stood
out like whip cords on the backs of his
hands but his voice was steady when it
came

  no mr mullaney i havent seen a
soul

ill

jfs the rear hall of the st stephen
pjj extended the entire width of the
 building it was seldom used two
sets of elevators draining the influx of the
lobby and the entrance of the ballroom
giving directly upon the main hall there
was no one in sight when the slight gray
figure slipped from the door of the ante-
room into the red-carpeted softly lighted
vestibule

  there was a side entrance leading off
the hall ending in a revolving glass door
for the use of those conservative guests who
preferred its semi-seclusion to the great
marble lobby and its fleet of cushion-
warmers

  it was toward this blessedly isolated
refuge that the girl now turned then
warned by that curious sixth sense she
flung one furtive look over her shoulder

  a figure loomed in sight down the red
vista-a tall man coming at more than
the usual walk the girl was filled with
sudden panic and it was by an almost

superhuman effort that she forced herself
to walk rapidly away instead of running as
her terror urged her to do

  once around the bend in the wall how-
ever she broke into a run her feet seeming
to her excited mind to drag with the horrible
lack of progress felt in some dreams the
man turned the comer before she reached
the revolving door still coming straight
toward her frantically the girl flung her-
self against the door terrified lest he be the
house-detective already warned of the neck-
laces disappearance

  the cool night air rushed on her hot face
gratefully and she fairly fell down the steps
seeing from the corner of her eye that black
figure still coming perilously near by now

  the street extended on each side of the
hotel brightly lighted for blocks and filled
with but a slight scattering of people it
would be easy to trace a fleeing figure there
the girl stood for a moment in agonized
indecision-then she saw her way out

  a long blue machine had pulled up beside
the curb its engine beating sullenly while
the solitary man at the wheel lit a cigaret
even as its startled driver looked up the
girl was fumbling with the catch on the
front door her words tumbling inco
herently from her lips

  please help me-drive me away from
here-anywhere-only be quick i cant
stop to explain-hell be here for
heavens sake hurry-please

  the match flickered up toward the
young mans fingers unnoticed while he
stared open-mouthed at this latest ap-
parition automatically he reached over
and opened the door but it was not until
the girl flung herself in and huddled down
on the seat beside him that he electrified
into animation

  cigaret and match were thrown over-
board his eyes jerked to the road ahead
the big car slammed into gear squirmed
its way across the rushing traffic of market
street and shot up one of the dark right-
angled arteries winch lead off to the south
section of the city

  blocks of narrow dark houses and stores
whirled by them intersected by dismal
vacant lots-for much of this part of san
francisco still speaks of the fire of twelve
years ago a few lighted oases appeared-
cheap rooming-houses or all-night restau-
rants breaking the blackness at uncertain
intervals the city grew lonely quiet

gfl


adventure

spreading out into the flat poverty-
stricken potrero

  only when several blocks lay between
them and brightly lighted market street
did the girl abandon her tense pose con-
fident that they were not being followed

  as if sensing her relaxation the driver
slacked the speed of the machine until he
could safely turn his head to look at her

  he was good to look at this young man
the elegant society favorite stamped on
him from the immaculate dress tie visible
under the loosened black silk muffler to
the expensive dancing pump whose polished
tip was resting on the throttle straight
black brows almost met over a keen clever
nose giving a roman cast to his handsome
face his black eyes were at once curious
and admiringly appraising as they rested
on the girl

in the pale glare of a passing arc
light she smiled wanly up at him
her lips tremulous with strain
then she drew a long breath

  i dont know how ill ever thank you
she began simply i know youre won-
dering what in the world ive done you-
you must have thought i was crazy when
i threw myself at you that way

  well i gathered that you were-
slightly impatient

  he showed his even white teeth for a
moment

  at the raillery in his tone the girls eyes
dropped confusedly then looked almost
defiantly up to meet his gaze

  it all looks rather silly looking back on
it now-but i was just desperate i work
at hoyt  brainards im a manikin-a
fashion model i put on expensive dresses
so that customers can see how theyll
appear oh i know- as her glance
followed his surprised look toward the
golden flounces of the dress which showed
between the front parting of her coat-
youre wondering how i came to be dressed
like this and going to the st stephen
hotel when im only a fashion model
she tilted her chin up like one who
resolves to have it all over with

  i had this dress on late this afternoon
when i was called to the telephone were
not allowed to be called to the phone when
were on the floor but i slipped into the
booth dress and all i didnt expect to
be there so long but when i came out the

closing bell was ringing i was awfully
afraid they would be angry so i ran to the
fitting-room and tried to take it off but it
hooks down the back and i couldnt
reach it

  all the girls had gone home she con-
tinued there wasnt a soul there but
the manager of our floor and he-hes an
old grouch she made a little face he
was angry because i was so late and i didnt
dare tell him id been phoning i tried to
take the dress off until i grew nearly des-
perate

  he scolded me through the door and
finally i was afraid to wait any longer i
grabbed up my long coat and flung it on-
it covered the dress all up and he never
knew i wasnt in my own clothes when i
ran by him i thought i could go down
to work early tomorrow and change before
any one suspected the dress was gone

  then when i came home i got to think-
ing-i knew the gaddis-neville wedding
was to occur tonight and i was just dying
to see it id heard so much about it from
customers who came to the store and it
seemed like a heaven-sent chance

  she hesitated to look pleadingly into the
eyes of the man watching her so inter-
estedly the big machine was purring
along slowly through the darkness the
man had throttled it down to hear the
plaintive voice better now he smiled
encouragingly and the girl continued

  so i went it was such fun no one
suspected i didnt have a right there
toms eyes rose accusingly in her conscience
at this but she hurried on i mingled
with the crowd and a couple of men thought
theyd been introduced to me and had
forgotten my name and they danced with
me-it was fine while it lasted then-oh
it seemed as if my heart stood still-i heard
a fat woman talking excitedly-i heard her
saying ive been robbed-mr gaddis my
necklace is gone-my emerald necklace
and then every one got excited and i heard
a man say something about them searching
every one and making sure they had a right
to be there-oh it was dreadful

  the gray eyes flooded with fear at the
remembrance and in the gleam of the cowl-
light the pale gold tendrils of her hair
appeared to cling about her white face in
terror

  and then what did you do the man
asked gently
emeralds and blondie



  the girl jerked her eyes from the dark
road ahead and looked up into his face
again

  i ran away i know it made me look
guilty but dont you see-i didnt dare say
who i was-theyd dismiss me at the store
for daring to wear a dress out of there and
id never get another position in san
francisco i was out of work once and

i was afraid-afraid-

  her voice died to a whisper then she
appeared to give herself a mental shake and
took a fresh start

  i ran away before they could search me
she glossed over toms breach of faith with
a grateful little reservation but as i
was going down the hall i saw a man
walking quickly toward me i was afraid
i was followed and when i saw your car
i thought only of getting away

  impulsively she leaned closer to the man
whose gaze enveloped her with a half-
amused tenderness her eyes were almost
tragically grateful as she looked up at him

  oh i dont know how to thank you-
it would have been so dreadful for me i

cant tell you how grateful i-

  she stopped suddenly aware of some
subtle change in her companion his face
appeared to have slipped on a wooden mask
the black eyes narrowed looking intently
at the flounce of the troublesome golden
dress

  instinctively the girls gaze followed his
and her lips parted in a gasp green and
wicked in the glare of the cowl-light seem-
ing to coruscate with diabolical glee at each
slight vibration of the machine swung
the two stolen emeralds only their odd
square setting and a tiny strand of the
golden chain was visible and that merely
because some impetuous movement on the
girls part had disarranged the upper
flounce of the gold gown it was a careless
chance which had shown them to the man-
when she was standing up the overlapping
flounce of the dress would conceal them

  the silence which followed seemed heavy
the humming of the motor beat in the girls
ears as a muffled roar the mans words
seemed physical blows on her conscious-
ness

  pretty slick pret-ty slick you nearly
got away with it sister but not quite-
and thats where i come in dont make
any mistake blondie this is a fifty-fifty
job

iv

wttjb it was a full minute before the
girl spoke in a queer choked tone

      why-how did that get
there-

  she reached over and raising the golden
flounce released the clasp of the necklace
from the mesh of pearls which interlaced it

  as the smooth cool stones slipped
through her fingers a thousand varying
shades of green shot through the gems
they seemed alternately to pale and flush
with color like living things now filled
with the clear transparent green of sun-
light seen through sea-water now richly
dark almost black in their deep hearts
twin emeralds-no uralian stones these
nor yet the brazilian emeralds which are
mere green tourmalin but the perfect
oriental emerald sisters to those marvelous
gems mined long ago from the hot sands of
jebel zabara that they might glow royally
against cleopatras black hair

  for the first time the girl seemed to grasp
the enormity of the theft she raised
fascinated eyes to the man beside her

  at the sight of the jewels a tense watch-
fulness had supplanted the boyish poise
of the driver the handsome black eyes
had narrowed filled with an amusement
which appeared sinister to the girls terrified
gaze

  he showed his fine white teeth in a silent
laugh

  the games played out blondie cant
you see it you did some pretty keen
work-why you almost had me fooled there
for a time lord oh lord wont cleete
and the boys appreciate this

   he went off into a silent fit of laughter

  the girl had shrunk to the side of the
seat the stones allowed to slide together
carelessly in her lap

  what do you mean but she asked it
automatically as one on whom a light is
breaking

  oh lord oh lord

  her simple question seemed to afford
even greater amusement to the man then
his manner suddenly changed he straight-
ened up severely

  look here blondie dont over-act or
youll begin to bore me you might as well
make up your mind to split three ways on
this job yourself-me and cleete
maybe you could have gotten away with it
io

adventure

if you hadnt stumbled on my car-say
that was the richest yet-but youre no fool
you must realize you couldnt get rid of
that thing this side of the rockies at least
without coming through to cleete this
playing a lone hand may go back east
but remember youre spotted easier out
here there arent so many of us and if
we begin backbiting and double-crossing-
well he finished with grim humor therell
be still less

  but i dont understand insisted the
girl she had conquered her first terror
and her eyes met the mans almost de-
fiantly i was telling you the truth i
dont know how i got the necklace and
whats more i dont know how ill give it
back without them finding at the store that
i wore the dress-

  take off your hat the man suddenly
ordered

  there was an expression in his eyes which
prompted the girl to obey hastily

  with the broad-brimmed hat away a
mass of golden hair toppled on to her
shoulders it was hair which would be
noticeable anywhere a crown for a princess
fine silky strands of a peculiar metallic
luster the pale hue of virgin gold with an
odd frosty fight in the loose waves

  the man took a strand in his hand
apparently unaware that the girl shrank
involuntarily away and examined it in-
tently when he looked up again his eyes
were mocking

  cut the comedy blondie youre cer-
tainly as slick as they say you are but get
it through your head that the games
played out

  a thrill of combined fear and anger
shook the girl but by a desperate effort
she controlled her voice

  ive told you the truth i dont know
what you mean by cleete you dont
think i deliberately took that necklace
do you

  the man turned to her sharply as one
would to an ill-bred persistent child

  of course not i believe in fairies-
they hooked it into your skirt thats all
now look here blondie it was told around
the club that you were coming from the
east were prepared to welcome you all
right but youve got to understand that
every game you play out west here cleete
stands in on we back each other up
blondie because we have to its safer

his words seemed to hold a double meaning
you cant buck the combination its
bigger than you are

  for a moment the big car hummed along
silently then the man spoke again

  that was clever stuff you pulled in
mobile and the mardi gras business in
new orleans-after seeing you i think you
could do bigger work than this trinket-
lifting with a half-contemptuous glance
at the glowing green in the girls lap but
having the system is only half the battle
out here youve got to have the club
behind you and god help you if you double-
cross cleete

  as he finished speaking the machine
suddenly leaped into life and spurted down
the san bruno road a lonely highway
following the shore-line of the back bay
winding past railroad yards tanneries and
dismal straggling little farms worked by
italians and portuguese

  to the girls frantic pleading the man
gave one curt reply

  were going to the club

  at san bruno the blue car turned again
into the main highway purring down to
the conservative thirty miles an hour gait
other machines whizzed by them more
than one indulgent smile was thrown their
way as cars caught up jogged alongside
for a brief moment then darted ahead a
good-looking young man in evening clothes
and a pretty girl-it was only too evident
they were taken for a couple of sweethearts
on a lark twice the girl narrowly stifled
the scream for help which rose in her throat
only to remember in time the damning
evidence in her hand

  the clock dial pointed to midnight still
die blue machine hummed along never
sinking below the thirly-an-hour point yet
never exceeding it it was evident that
the astute young man at the wheel was
running no chance of being pinched with
its attendant embarrassing explanations

  tree-shaded burlingame rushed by then
san mateo nearly dark at this hour it
was only when the machine swerved from
the smooth asphalt of the highway and
turned west on a bumpy dirt road that the
girl became watchfully alert again

  an old picket fence its whitewash flaked
off in great patches suddenly sprang up on
the edge of the road a few seconds later
they slowed before a semi-circular iron gate
surmounted by two old-fashioned iron
emeralds and blondie



lamps once marvels of workmanship but
now corroded and unlit unseen mechan-
ism worked by the wheels of the car passing
over an iron plate in the ground swung
the great gates slowly inward and they
rolled up a long avenue of gloomy euca-
lyptus trees

  the girl was leaning forward in the seat
now her hands tightly clenched her eyes
wide the place was evidently a fair-sized
rather shiftlessly worked farm in the
moonlit patches between the trees she could
see small regular hay piles casting round-
topped black shadows seemingly as solid as
themselves two straggling rows of vege-
tables artichokes apparently kept pace
with the driveway

at the end of the gravel drive a
patch of eucalyptus containing a
house loomed squarely in their way
a gaunt high house built in the gloomy
style of the s with tortuous scrollwork
emphasizing each high blank window and
outlining the deep narrow doorway

  a spanish veranda ran the width of the
upper story its perpendicular railings em-
phasized by the moonlight so grotesquely
that it took on the appearance of grinning

  the gravel driveway led to the front
steps broad and shallow then swept semi-
circularly around and disappeared in the
rear the whole effect was deserted one
of the high windows which looked out each
side of the door was entirely boarded up
from within the glass panes of the other
glistened blankly in the moonlight

  at the sinister appearance of the house
the girls face went white and she seized
the door with a half-formed idea of leaping
out and taking her chance in a foot-race
between the trees before this plan could
harden into resolution the blue car had
swept around to the rear of the place

  here the trees pressed so closely on the
building that their rustling branches scraped
the wooden veranda overhead which dupli-
cated the one in front

  the machine abruptly slowed then
stopped the driver killed the engine and
turned to the tense girl beside him

  all right blondie now if youll be so
kind as to step out-

  he reached over and unfastened the
catch on the door not appearing to notice
the girls involuntary shrinking as his sleeve
brushed her knees mutely she obeyed

him her necklace was gripped convul-
sively in her hand until the settings cut
into the palm

  the two shallow steps which led to the
porch were ankle-deep with drifted euca-
lyptus leaves everything spoke of the
greatest desolation

  the man put his hand under the girls
elbow courteously to help her to the porch-
his manner was irreproachable they might
have been at the st stephen even in the
tension of the moment the girl was cogniz-
ant of the startling picture they must make
the moon sifting through the trees cast
black shadows on the porch below it
traced the young mans profile against the
dark background of the door with cameo-
like clearness the black meeting arch of his
eyebrows causing him to appear more
roman warrior-like than ever

  the white front of his dress-shirt gleamed
beneath the loosened muffler and the un-
buttoned overcoat he stood with his
head bent slightly to one side as though
listening intently the while his knuckles
beat a careless tattoo as one will do with
a mind half-abstracted from the business
in hand under his breath as though by
chance he was whistling the opening bars
of la paloma slightly prolonging the
plaintive minor notes

  the girl had shrunk against the rickety
balustrade of the porch her fascinated
gaze fixed on the mans profile in the
white flood of moonlight her hair took on
a frosty light almost unearthly so pale
gold did it become her deep-set gray eyes
became almost black in the shadow li
the gap of her coat the telltale gleam
of the golden dress flashed out the sewn
pearls gleaming opalescently as though
claiming kinship with the moonlight

  twice the young man tapped in seeming
indifference but the astute gaze of the
girl saw his head bend even closer and his
brows became one unbroken line in impa-
tience the house apparently remained as
deserted as before then although she
had heard no noise the girl was startlingly
aware that other eyes were upon them

  without changing her position in the
slightest she shifted her eyes from the mans
face to the left side of the door the door-
frame was a mass of intricate carving
even as she looked the wind swayed a
branch of the complaining eucalyptus and
the moonlight flooded the porch
adventure

  it was only for a breaths space but long
enough for the girl to see that a portion
of the door-jamb was missing-a narrow
slot about six inches by two between a
couple of clumsy scrolls where it had
been the moon glistened upon the whites
of two eyes silently regarding them black
eyes like two beady shoe-buttons stuck in
the door-jamb

  the girl smothered the scream that rose
in her throat but the palms of her hands
went cold and wet there was something
so sinister in that silent unblinking scrutiny
that the girl sick with terror was reaching
for the mans arm when the eyes vanished
and the missing portion of woodwork
reappeared

v

the door swung slowly inward
the room was velvet black save
where the moon sought out chinks
closed shutters and pointed long
fingers through them to fall in
splinters on the bare floor as the man and
girl stepped over the threshold a match
flared up to show them a dark-faced man
touching it to the wick of a kerosene lamp

  he replaced the chimney on the lamp
and taking it in his hand turned toward
them his grotesque black shadow suddenly
leaping up the wall behind him until it shot
half-way across the shadowy ceiling

  in the swift shrinking glance the girl
flung about the room she saw nothing more
than might have been expected from the
outside of the house a stove red with
rust and propped under one rickety leg
with bricks occupied one corner a wood-
box half-filled grew on the eye out of the
shadows from rude shelves visible in the
wavering dusk came the metallic gleam
of pots and pans three old and scarred
rush-bottomed chairs intruded themselves
in the flickering radius of the lamplight

  the tenant himself bore out the general
appearance-a portuguese farmer from the
silent evidence of his soiled checked shirt
and the mud-spattered trousers

  no words passed between the two men
it was evident that this scene had become
so commonplace as to be undeserving of
comment the portuguese held the lamp
slightly aloof and walked ahead of them
to a door which gradually became visible
as the light moved across the bare room

  the other man turned to his companion
courteously

  straight ahead blondie if you please

  for a brief moment the girl fought a
loathing to venture further in that house
of mystery then realizing how little good
objection would do her she nervously
moistened her dry lips and followed the
will-o-the-wisp of light

  the portuguese had started down a long
hall as bleak and dark as the kitchen had
been his heavy-soled boots making a
hideous clamor on the uncarpeted floor

 midway up the hall he paused and
opening a door stood aside to let them
enter

  the girl caught her breath audibly
the sudden contrast was startling even
dramatic it was a room magically con-
jured out of monte cristos palace and
fitted up with the same kingly magnificence
the walls themselves were ebony-ebony
inlaid with the milky whiteness of mother-
of-pearl even the floor was of the same
dark wood polished until it shone like the
back of a maratta shield and this black
splendor was merely the casket to make
more marvelous the jewels it held

  by contrast the rugs on the floor ap-
peared to glow rugs which even to a
novice proclaimed their priceless lineage
no tawdry imitations these anilin-dyed
and acid-washed to deceive the infidel
but silk rugs from persia made in the
golden age of rugs their pile but lightly
worn and their mellow colors still unfaded
though five centuries had passed since slim
brown fingers had tied the sehna knots

  in the amber light of the hanging lamps
above them their blue hearts seemed to
pulsate with the very intensity of color
with the old lost persian blue the leafy
scrolls-for they were not of the pattern
of the sunni that austere mohammedan
sect but reflected instead the freer shiah as
could be seen by the topaz cartouches en-
closing kufic inscriptions-appeared to
sway as though stirred to life by a miracu-
lous wind

  nor was this all the eye wandered be-
yond the seven mica-shaded lamps swinging
from the shadowy ceiling strayed by the
throne-like chairs of ebony fascinating
by reason of the unrelieving black velvet
cushions which turned them into sil-
houettes and lingered enthralled upon the
vases which surrounded the room and



in the
white
emeralds and blondie



gleamed jewel-like out of the mellow dusk
here even the kindling shades of the rugs
were outdone the effect was a symphony
in color-and such color as only an artist
de quincey might dream

  pale jasper over carved gold ruby
sapphire transparent violet over white
seme with golden stars the glorious con-
trast of purple and cobalt over foil and the
deeper notes of ivory black and orange-
the matchless enamel of priceless cloisonnc

  even before she noticed the occupants of
the room the girl drank the background
in not even her fear sufficing to deaden
her amazement then she became aware
that two men had ceased their low-toned
conversation and quietly alert were re-
garding her from the depths of the cush-
ioned chairs

  her companion nodded carelessly to one
greeted the other wrapped in a dark green
silk lounging robe with a casual how are
you clieve and still steering the girl
before him advanced to meet a figure
which now appeared between two heavy
velvet curtains across the large room

  a little surprise for you cleete he
spoke lightly but there was a certain defer-
ence in his manner which did not escape
the girl we have in our midst blondie
accompanied by the chetwynd emeralds

  in spite of the perilous position in which
she found herself the girls eyes widened
in surprise as they took in the small almost
pudgy figure the pale-colored hair and the
mild inquiring blue eyes behind the thick
glasses that this was the cleverest fence
on the pacific coast seemed ridiculous he
might have been a divinity student in-
advertently wandered into an exclusive
gentlemens club and a trifle incongruous
with his surroundings his manner of
greeting the girl heightened this impression
he turned again to the man

  didnt expect you tonight treviflion
croix was in about an hour ago looking
for you

  trevillion laughed

  ij expected to meet him but ran into
blondie instead the storys too good to
keep

  he started to laugh again then in reply
to cleetes mildly inquiring look he related
the circumstances of the meeting

  when he finished he looked again at the
girl from narrow amused eyes

  going to fess up blondie and admit

that you were trying to deceive the hand-
some stranger

  the girls face had gone deathly white
a fine little dew had sprung out on her
forehead and beaded her upper lip but her
amused laugh rang true

  youve got me all right but really
you didnt think  was going to open my
heart to the first kind man who gave me
an auto ride did you i knew you recog-
nized me as blondie-it was my hair did
the trick wasnt it-but you see i wasnt
so sure of you i thought you were playing
a lone hand and just bluffing about the
club and-and cleete

  she faltered a trifle over the name then
rushed on

  i thought you were working it to get
the emeralds for yourself and i was going
to call your bluff you dont suppose that
i pulled that mobile business and the
boston game you mentioned by giving up
the stuff to the first person who hailed me
by my name

  trevillion was entranced

  it was worth a million to watch you
work it blondie why really she had me
guessing there at the first

  he turned to his chief

but the other man was not dis-
posed to follow his lead a sur-
prising change had come over him
as trevillion had related with glee the
girls protestations of innocence cleete
had transferred his gaze to her and she now
raised her eyes to receive the full force of
his stare his face wore an expression she
had not deemed him capable of the heavy
lids of his eyes were rolled back and the
irises rather terrifyingly enlarged by the
lenses of the glasses belched forth a steady
blue flame for the first time the girl
sensed the innate power of the man

  his voice too was as crisp as the snap-
ping of dried twigs

  none of that blondie youve got to
fall in line on this coast i figured youd
try something like this so did riddle
he said youd try to play a lone hand when
he tipped me off that you were coming
the threat in his tone was only half-
veiled the girls face went a shade whiter
and she interrupted half-hysterically
but i didnt i didnt i was going to
come here to-to split on the emeralds
but i wasnt sure of trevillion how did


adventure

i know he wasnt a cop trying to bluff me
into admitting who i was of course when
he really brought me here i knew it was
all right but i wasnt going to admit any-
thing until i was dead sure

  trevillions black eyes regarded her
admiringly

  thats good logic cleete if blondie
wasnt clever enough to watch her step
she couldnt pull the stuff she does

  the blue flame had died from the chiefs
eyes and he grunted noncommittally

  all right but in case riddle didnt tip
you off before you left the east i will
this club isnt founded for sheerly social
purposes- with deep sarcasm-its for
mutual protection and remember whatever
you pull on this coast the club stands in on
there arent the big cities here that there
are back east and its harder to dispose of
the stuff if youre square with the club
the club will stand behind you and-another
little tip blondie-youll need the club
before you get through the east was
getting pretty hot for you and in the west
theyll spot you sooner dont forget
which side your bread is buttered on
no one has ever double-crossed me-yet
the last words would have been reas-
suring but something sinister lurked behind
the ominously quiet tone it left the girls
fascinated eyes on cleetes face her tongue
cleaving to the roof of her mouth nor
could she speak nor look away until he
chose to remove his gaze

  now then the emeralds the man held
out his hand imperiously

  still under that hypnotic blue stare the
girl meekly pulled them out of her pocket
and dropped them into his outstretched
palm

  the man barely glanced at them their
glorious green splendor might have been
so much putty from the contemptuous
manner in which his fingers closed over
them he led the way to the small room
beyond but for trevillions courteous
clasp on her arm the girl would have stood
rooted to the spot like a disciplined child
too terrified to move

  the small room was devoted almost
entirely to a large round safe like the
other it was lit by the same mica-shaded
lamps there were no windows in either
room it was evident that only the heart
of the house was thus lavishly furnished
for through the space of a velvet curtain

the girl could catch a glimpse of a barren
room beyond gray with dust the room
of the boarded-up window

  when the chetwynd emeralds had been
flung loosely in the safe and the heavy door
swung to on them cleete turned about
the fire had faded from his heavy-lidded
eyes but a grim little line still ran about
his mouth

  this is a three-way split it may be a
month before ill have a chance to get in
touch with riddle on this thing of course

if you want any money advanced-

  no the girl almost gasped it i-i
have enough to get by on

  the chief shrugged and became almost
miraculously the inoffensive pudgy little
figure he had first appeared but the
terror of that fierce revealment was still
upon the girl and her relief as cleete left
them and went out to the other room to
meet a newcomer was apparent to the
amused trevillipn

  rather crimped you didnt he
blondie

  he steered her reluctant steps to the large
room again and indicated a chair

  for a brief moment the girl hesitated
casting a frightened look toward the door
then as if the strength had suddenly gone
out of them her legs crumpled beneath her
and she sank into the chair

  trevillion flung himself into the one
opposite where his evening clothes promptly
merged into the background of the velvet
cushions leaving him merely a white shirt
front and a detached face rather horribly
swimming in a pool of blackness

  thats the one thing that blights
cleetes young life he explained lightly
any one slipping anything over on him
in answer to the girls inquiring look
cleetes square we know we can trust
him and he makes us play quite as fair
hes right too its only cooperation
that has enabled us to play our games as
long and as safely as we have

  he interrupted another nervous glance
the girl was stealing toward the door and
his voice grew a trifle sharp

  dont lose your nerve blondie merely
because of a little disciplining on cleetes
part if this shakes you i dont see how
you got away with that mobile stuff

  his words acted as a tonic on the girl
she suddenly jerked her eyes back to his
and forced a laugh
emeralds and blondie



  you want to remember im not used
to him i had no idea a person could
change so-appear two such separate

people-

  trevillion nodded as if she had scored
its rather uncanny doctor jekyll and
mr hyde effect-cleetes a strange man
i wouldnt take a chance on double-crossing
him for the kohinoor itself i dont blame
you though for making the attempt-oh
dont be afraid that im going to give you
away at the girls involuntary start of
surprise i knew you were trying to get
clean with the emeralds but really it isnt
safe blondie cleete would have got you
in the end

  maybe riddle didnt explain enough
about us were unique-oh there are
gangs of course but were more than a
gang we work the thing scientifically
or better yet on business methods big
stuff is all we bother with and we special-
ize too i do society-the same as you
croix does the races the stock game and
anything where good-fellowship comes into
play that chap clieve i spoke to as we
came in he nodded toward the man in
the silk lounging-robe does the foreign
minister stuff hes a wonder at worming
himself into diplomatic circles

  weve got it down fine and thats why
were so safe theres never anything crude
pulled none of our finger-prints are hang-
ing around as art studies for zealous young
detectives to memorize cleete receives
the stuff and in due course we get the
money i dont know how he gets rid
of it he shrugged a movement almost
invisible against the cushions i dont
know-none of us know its none of our
business when you come down to it so long
as we get our share

but this- the girl broke in hoarsely
the effort she was making to hold up her
end of the conversation was evident by
main will she kept her longing glance from
straying toward the door again

 i-i never thought-i never saw-
crooks-in a place like this

  trevillion laughed silently his black
eyes narrowed to slits in his amusement
until his face was like a sharp white mask

  cleetes idea-the club and crooks-
really blondie i wish you wouldnt offend
my sensibilities gentlemen adventurers
if you dont mind kipling knew-were
poor little lambs who have lost our way

were little black sheep who have gone
astray while some of us may have
reached this dizzy height via the second-
story route we pride ourselves on being
esthetic nothing less than ten thousand
for a job-it really doesnt pay by the time
you split with cleete

  whats cleete in it for the girl
fired the question at him sharply it
isnt for the money only is it look at the
way he handled the emeralds

t  trevillion gave her a com-
 mendatory glance

 j you hit it blondie not the
money-that is for the moneys sake he
doesnt give a hang about it its to gratify
his one passion

  trevillion was perfectly serious now
it was evident that the peculiar character
of cleete had taken possession of his imag-
ination strongly

  all men have some main passion in life
with some its women-its drink with
some or making money but cleete doesnt
care for a red cent its cloisonne vases
with him heaven knows where he gets
them but he spends thousands on a little
piece of enamel no bigger than your fist
says its the highest expression of art i
believe hed commit murder for a bit of
ware hed set his heart upon

  the mans matter-of-fact tone chilled the
girl but her nervous tremor went un-
noticed by trevillion who had turned to
hail the chief as he passed behind their
chairs

  im telling blondie about your vases
he explained as easily as if this was a casual
ballroom conversation

  now the heavy lids were rolled back but
this time the eyes were wide with interest
the fanatical gleam of the connoisseur
burned in cleetes gaze his other purpose
was instantly forgotten and he lingered by
their chairs

  hundreds of them he waved his hand
toward the rich gleam of the vases visible
through the amber-shaded gloom and
every one a gem crisaille basse-taille-
oh a perfect example of that the gold most
exquisitely carved-champleve enamel too
but mostly cloisonne that is what i am
focusing on i have them all perfect
examples of the rare tourquoise blue and
one vase of vesica-shaped medallions which
rivals the pala doro of st marks


adventure

  the girls eyes were fixed fascinated on
his transfigured face though his words were
as so many empty sounds to her ears the
pudgy features through some trick of
expression had suddenly become elongated
they were sharp ravenous even-the look
of a wolf on the trail

  look at this

  his voice was tremulous with intense
feeling the hand which had flung two
matchless emeralds so carelessly into the
safe now reverently displayed the six-inch
vase in his hand

  a perfect specimen of the highest
byzantine period a jewel see-the
purest primary coloring-it was not until
centuries later that they discovered the
subtle shadings you know he turned the
barbaric little object tenderly in his hand
to display the rich reds and blues cloi-
son of purest copper and see the velvet
depth of that black enamel

  priceless-priceless he was whispering
to himself his prominent blue eyes held
hypnotically by the object in his hand
the most exquisite art-beauty passed
through thought and fixed in form he
suddenly jerked his head up and the blank
gleam in his eyes turned them quite mad
two colors only i lack-two colors-the
unknown lemon yellow in a vitrified state
and opaque vermilion-they say there is
no ware of that-that it has never been
discovered but i know better-there is
his face grew radiant
one vase-peerless-i saw it once-
i held it in my hands his eyes seemed to
coruscate with their sudden lust for posses-
sion to think that i held it in my
hands the priceless secret vermilion
deep bright lights in its depth like a pigeon-
blood cloisonne but yellow-glorious as an
autumn sunset it had cost fortunes-
it had cost lives-it was the pinnacle of
beauty i held it in my hands-and i let
it be taken away

  cleetes voice which had grown hys-
terically shrill sank to a whisper on the last
words the lids of his eyes drooped it
was as though a film was drawn between
their mad blue fire and the spellbound
couple in the chairs abruptly he turned
on his heel and left them

  even trevillions debonair manner was
shaken by cleetes tirade the girl was
unable to control a long slow shudder of
morbid fear

  hes crazy

  trevillion busied himself with a cigaret
for a moment before he replied

  perhaps every one is more or less of
a monomaniac on some subject why not
cloisonne ware as well as old masters
lives and fortunes have been lost for them
cleete is merely original his passion will
undoubtedly some day cause his death
he finished in a calmly judicial tone

  again the girl was shaken by a shudder
and the smile she forced on trevillion was
a ghastly failure

  please take me home-back to the city
i-im always all in after a job like i pulled
tonight

  she led the way gamely to the door
forcing herself to walk easily no one would
have guessed that the rugs and walls and
gleaming vases were all swimming before
her in a mad blaze of color her hands
were clinched until the nails drove little
half-moons into the palms if trevillion had
touched her she would have screamed hys-
terically the dark face of the portuguese
coming suddenly out of the shadows turned
herweak with fright

  then the night air gratefully clean and
cool fell like a benediction on her upturned
feverish face

vi

at half-past five mrs sproule
raised her drowsy head from the
pillow to listen to a stealthy noise
in the hall outside her door it was a
brushing shuffling sound

  for a moment the good lady lay re-
sembling an l on its back then with
sigh like the intake of a vacuum-sweeper
she dropped her head back to the horizontal
position and proceeded to make the most
of the half-hour nap left it was only the
cat most likely

  but mrs sproule was doing the cat an
injustice the cat was curled up behind
the coat scuttle it was tom fleming
tastefully arrayed in overcoat and pajamas
going down to the front porch to get the
morning paper

  just what tom expected to find in the
paper he had not dared to admit to himself
his sleep had been a tortuous string of
emerald-studded dreams and the faint thud
which announced the advent of the morning
paper had sent him creeping barefooted
down the stairs after it
emeralds and blondie

  there it was-a column and a half on the
front page under a two-column cut of mrs
chetwynd in a pose which showed off the
lost necklace and her double chin to
advantage

  tom curled his cold toes under him and
plunged in at the end he was both
relieved and contemptuous there was
no mention of the single unbidden guest
who had slipped through the door of the
ante-room nor of the faithless young man
who had let her go helen mercer had
got safely away-thanks to his own gulli-
bility-so had the chetwynd emeralds

  by all the law of logic toms mind
should have been the opposite of somber
he had taken part in a drama which should
have spread the purple and gold of romance
over his mental skies to be sure there
was the chagrin of letting a twenty-thou-
sand-dollar necklace slip through his fingers
so to speak but it was not this which
caused tom to fling his clothes at himself
so savagely nor yet his broken word to
mullaney

  nor again was it the fact that to helen
mercer he must appear an easily impressed
fool it was something deeper still the
hurt realization that gray eyes could look
into his so candidly and still lie the mem-
ory of an appealing face framed in pale
gold a face childlike in its frightened inno-
cence whose expression now he knew to be
the consummate point of art

  that thought was a wound which welled
the venom of distrust until toms whole
world became tinged with the same horrid
hue it was altogether unlikely that the
girl would ever set foot in the ofarrell
street house or even that she had left any
clue by which he could trace her but that
habit of thoroughness caused tom to see
the thing through so far as lay within his
power

  but it was with little hope and still less
tact that he introduced the subjeet as he
stopped at the landladys door on his
way out

  theres a girl living here-or was
rather-by the name of helen mercer
he began phlegmatically to the rather dis-
arranged lady who answered his knock
do you know anything about her mrs
sproule

  the landladys eyes wandered sharply
over his grave young face while her hand
strayed up and tucked in a kid curler which

had escaped from under the limp net frill
of the discouraged-appearing boudoir cap

  no more than that i aint had no com-
plaints about her she seems to be an
honest young woman an pays her rent in
advance

  her tone was acid and said that she saw
no reason to give information about one
lodger to another

  tom continued too dispirited to take
offense

  do you know any of her friends any
way so i could follow her up i mean

  if you wait till six this evening mr
fleming shell probably tell you herself
the landladys hands were placed bellig-
erently on her hips it was only the abject
wretchedness on the young mans face
which kept her from telling the fresh mr
fleming what she thought of this uncalled-
for curiosity

  she generally gets home about then
tom positively winced he knew that
helen mercer would never get home at
six again when he spoke again it was
so earnestly that the sharp remark forming
on mrs sproules lips died a-borning

  im awfully anxious to find out about
helen mercer mrs sproule if you can
help me ill be more than grateful i-i
cant tell you just what for- the pleading
gray eyes of the night before seemed to
swim in the air before him and in spite of
himself he added-its nothing to her
discredit but ive simply got to find her
something of his wretchedness must
have escaped in his tone for the landladys
words were sharper than her tone when she
replied

well i guess youll have to wait till
tonight no matter how important it is
shes already gone to work this morning
toms spine straightened as if an electric
current had suddenly been turned into it

  you-did you say she was here-here
this morning she came home here last
night

  the landladys lips pinched reprovingly
she certainly did i make it my busi-
ness to keep tab on my lodgers come in
late she did but when a girls young and
pretty shell be staying out late once in a
while and i aint narrow-minded miss

mercer is a lady-

  tom interrupted her the change in
the young man was alarming mrs sproule
found herself viewing him with decided
adventure

alarm with her words the unreasoning
hope that helen mercer could explain the
apparently explainable tingled through
toms very finger-tips she had come
home if she had taken the emeralds she
wouldnt have done that maybe she
had been sincere in her agitation the night
before maybe mullaney had overlooked
the emeralds and they would yet be found
without implicating helen mercer the
honest gray eyes hadnt lied-and she
didnt think he was a soft-hearted fool

  the purple and gold rolled across the
horizon again-once more the world was
lit by pale gold hair and the radiance of
gray eyes

  tom was a little wild-looking the
impressionistic mrs sproule took a back-
ward step she had heard of a case once
where a young man just toms age had
gone suddenly mad and chased his aged fath-
er up into an apple tree with a bread-knife

  mrs sproule- odd how much music
could be injected into that name-where
does miss mercer work

  tom fairly sang it and mrs sproule eased
herself still further into the safety zone

  hoyt  brainards she snapped and
the door was closed on the enemy

  that night at eight minutes to six the
crowds who passed a certain corner on
grant avenue were edified by the sight of a
young man stationed there whose head
was apparently set on a pivot hoyt 
brainards block-square store had two
entrances one main one leading upon
grant avenue the other smaller letting
upon an alley running along one side it
was only when the six oclock closing bell
rang and the main entrance had disgorged
its belated customers that the gentleman
with the versatile head was able to cease his
double-barrelled watch and concentrate
his vision on the small door which was
beginning to trickle saleswomen cash girls
buyers and department heads

  he received several coldly questioning
looks when he started nervously after
strange young ladies-these were always
blondes by the way-but he always re-
cuperated and came back to root again on
the spot which was beginning to be his
under squatters rights

  and then among the last she came
a hurrying little figure in the familiar gray
coat and her white face went whiter than
ever when she saw him waiting for her

  the young man plunged in breathless
from the excitement gripping him

  miss mercer i just had to come down
and meet you i didnt know whether
youd go home for dinner you know and
i couldnt wait another minute he had
tucked his hand under her elbow to help
her off the curb quite as though it was not
the first time he had done it ive been
on pins and needles to see you-after last
night you know you promised to tell me
about it-im curious although i always
knew you hadnt taken the necklace

  and he had known of course he had
maybe he had pretended to himself that
he had doubted her but down in his heart
he had known all the time that she hadnt
taken it why you could bank every time
on gray eyes that looked straight at you
a girl like that couldnt do anything crooked
if she were to try

  throughout the mad torrent of his speech
the girl had let her glance drop to the side-
walk a little pucker of indecision ap-
peared between the slim golden brows
twice she had started to interrupt and had
checked herself now she regarded him
with a long silent scrutiny from the corners
of the gray eyes when she did speak it
was slowly as though she was having a hard
time to find the words

  mr fleming im going to tell you
something because i have no one else to
turn to in a way i owe it to you-ill
never be able to thank you for letting me
go last night she gasped a little at the
picture her fancy painted it would have
been terrible for me because-you see-
i did have the emeralds

  tom never knew that he stopped still
his legs ceased their motion automatically
his brain too stunned to send out even
reflex orders to the growing horror and
disillusion on his face she continued

  oh please wait a minute-i didnt
take them-not intentionally that is i
didnt know a thing about it until later
ill tell you everything then i want you
to tell me what to do

  tom automatically began to walk again
and as she kept pace the girl talked

when she finished the young
mans face was a study in conflicting
emotions his voice was awe-
struck when he spoke

  what a little brick you are miss mercer
emeralds and blondie

to keep your head like that why i know
i couldnt do as well-and i wanted to be a
detective he finished a little self-con-
temptuously

  oh no the girl almost winced from
his praise and the faint pink flowed into
her pale cheeks any one would have
done what i did it was self-preservation
mr fleming i had to-to play safe she
explained simply it was not until i was
right in the club right before that terrible
cleete that i realized it all before then
it was like some horrible practical joke but
that mans eyes-they changed so- she
shivered again-i just grew sick all day
thinking what might have happened if
theyd happened to find out theyd made
a mistake

  i pretended to be this blondie of
course-i was afraid to ask any questions
for fear they would grow suspicious but
i tried to remember all the man called
trevillion had said about her and act up
to it i dont see now how i ever did it
the girls hands were working nervously
as an automobile slid up behind her with
a low warning growl she jumped and
shrank closer to tom

  it seemed an eternity until i dared to
get away from that horrible house

  how did you get home tom asked
trevillion drove me back in the car
she answered without hesitation i didnt
want him to know where i lived so i told
him the kingsbury hotel it was very
late and dark when we got there so i hid
in the entrance until he had driven away
then i ran home

  tom was unable to hide his admiration
  you clever little thing

  the girl shook her head vigorously to hide
her embarrassment

  mr fleming what shall we do that
necklace is around my conscience like a
millstone when the papers came out with
that long story about it this morning i
wanted to run away and hide i felt so
guilty i could hardly bear to meet
people-to come to work-but i had to
return that gold dress before they dis-
covered it was gone oh why did i ever
do such a silly thing as to wear it now
i dont know what to do

  got to turn the evidence over to the
police i suppose

  toms tone was reluctant he would
have preferred seeing this thing through in

story-book fashion the detective hero
in the movies and the best-sellers invariably
works independent of the forces of law and
order who are introduced only to show up
the heros own superior methods

  the suggestion appeared to fill the girl
with alarm

  no-oh no  her voice was sharp with
protest not the police-the whole thing
would come out then in reply to his look
of involuntary surprise her tone grew a
trifle calmer dont you see if the store
discovered that i wore the gold dress
without permission id never be able to
get another position in this city oh
please-mr fleming-cant you think of
any other way

  it was too much in league with his own
secret ambitions tom capitulated with
shameful alacrity

  well of course there must be a way
to get the emeralds back without yelling
to the whole world about it other fellows
have done things like that

  he scowled intently for a moment and
the only sound was the ring of their heels
on the pavement they were walking up
ofarrell street now where the apartment
houses lined the blocks like enormous
soap-boxes their lighted windows appear-
ing as holes revealing a center candle the
fog was already topping the hill behind the
great red cathedral the girl buttoned the
collar of her coat closer about her neck her
grave eyes fixed on the young mans face

 say-ive got it-i think tom
drawled at length his tongue lingering
over the words while his mind flashed back
over the plan which was solidifying in his
brain its kind of risky though itd
work if you had nerve enough to follow
but-look here

  in his enthusiasm he tucked the girls
arm close within his own his head bent
close to her pale gold hair

  well hire a machine-or maybe we
can borrow one-well never mind that
anyway

  he took a fresh grip on the arm

  look here well go down there in a
machine you and i tonight maybe well
drive up to this place taking care no one
sees me-can you drive a car fine at her
nod youre supposed to be alone see
well you go in-well have to cook up some
excuse for you going there but thats a mere
detail-and while this portuguese fellows
adventure

taking you in ill climb up on that porch
affair you said ran along the back of the
house and get in a window-or some way

  meanwhile youre keeping this cleete
busy talking in the club rooms so i have a
chance to sneak into the little room and
steal the necklace back then all we have
to do is make our get-away

  he waved his hand as if that was a mere
bagatelle

  to his disappointment the girl was not
overwhelmed in ecstasy at this attractive
plan

  it sounds rather vague she said
slowly

  well of course i havent worked it all
out yet-however if you want to chuck
the whole business i guess mrs chetwynd

can buy more-

  oh no-no the girl shook her head
positively i was responsible for the
necklace going out of the ballroom in the
first place and im going to see that they
are recovered and-and-im afraid to
tell the police she added in a whisper

  well-ill tell you what-ill take a
chance alone i can find the place by

myself and i guess ill get in somehow-

  again the girl interrupted him her
eyes were almost indignant when she looked
back at him

  as if id let you do all that dangerous
work alone she exclaimed in loyal scorn
i guess it could be done if i had the
courage she reflected slowly

  of course it could tom pointed out
eagerly all the romance in the world was
singing to him now its simple but
theres its strength im sure we could
get away with it

  but the necklace is in the safe cleete
locked it up how would you get at it
oh gee thats right

  tom was crestfallen again nothing
broke the muffled silence of the fog but
their own ringing footsteps then his
resourceful mind found the solution

  if we had a cracksman-a regular safe-
opener we could do it you know-
jimmy valentine stuff of sand-papering the
finger-tips and working the combination
ive got a friend who can maybe get me
one for a night tom spoke as if cracks-
men could be rented like taxies

  the girl still looked doubtful but toms
imagination was working on all six cylinders
now and was unstopable

  say ill bet any amount that we can
call the trick ill bet that mrs chetwynd
has her little old emeralds back by the day
after tomorrow and we pinch the whole-
and we arrest the lot itll be a big feather
in my cap and itll pull mullaney out of
the deuce of a hole-i ought to do this much
for mullaney he said virtuously by
george i will miss mercer you dont
have to worry a bit youd better stay
home in case theres any row and ill get
the emeralds back for you all hunky-
dory

  he turned his head to find helen mercers
steady gaze upon him there was an ex-
pression in those gray eyes which the young
fellow could not quite fathom her tone
betrayed amused toleration

  did you honestly think id stay at home
while you were running all that danger
to get the necklace back for me

  her lips curled into a peculiar little smile
before she turned back to the foggy street
again and her voice hardened with reso-
lution

  im ready to start with you mr
fleming whenever you say

mr william hartshorn
was a specialist and his specialty
was cracking safes mr hartshorn
could crack the toughest safe that ever
contained a banknote with the same neat-
ness and dispatch with which the average
citizen cracks an almond

  time had been when no gentleman in the
profession had worried the authorities more
by his tireless and efficacious methods but
of late the wheels of progress had been
turning without carrying mr hartshorn
along with them

  mr hartshorns-or to give him his
common or garden name-honest bills
main trouble was obviousness this is an
age of camouflage when the successful
crook to get by must resemble the rest of
the respectable background honest bill
on the other hand could only play the game
according to regulation rules just as the
old-time barnstormer must have his tin
armor his paper snow-storm and his east
lynne music so honest bill could only
crack a safe to the accompaniment of dark
lanterns of gum shoes and jimmies

and as the beplumed hamlets and
emeralds and blondie



betighted richards of the old days would
rave against the drawing-room hero of this
who acts without shouting and dies without
stamping so did honest bill rave in his
heart with the bitterest of professional
jealousy against those members of the new
regime who conducted their business with
no other aids save their own nimble wits

  neither could honest bill understand
a fence such as cleete this again was a
sign of the new complications the profession
had taken on but though he was not
in favor of the system though he did not
belong and knew better than to force his
way into that exclusive club he took the
utmost care to give it no reason for offense
the cloisonne vase collector and his asso-
ciates were feared among such as
honest bill as all of big tims north
beach gun-men had never been and they
were hated with all the zest of the unsuc-
cessful for those who succeed

  all of which is merely prelude to the fact
that when correctly approached in regard
to the little matter of opening the safe
where the chetwynd emeralds were serenely
twinkling to themselves honest bill was
inclined to listen to reason

  once only had he hesitated to look at
tom out of little suspicious eyes

  say there aint no joker in this thing
it aint no frame-up

  mullaney sent me explained the
young amateur detective dismissing in
that simple phrase the two hours pleading
worrying and eloquence which had been
brought to bear on the mystified mullaney
toms explanation to the detective had
been beautifully vague he had a hunch
which he thought would result in the return
of the emeralds if it was properly followed
up said hunch requiring for a successful
termination only one cracksman who would
obey orders

  it is only fair to mullaney to state that
under ordinary circumstances this modest
requisition would not have been supplied
but mullaney was in no position to with-
stand pressure emeralds loomed large
in his foreground even hunches from
amateur detectives were not to be over-
looked-nor on the other hand to be too
greatly encouraged mullaney were the
simple truth known capitulated largely
to be rid of toms flow of eloquence

  mullaney said that in view of that
marchmont affair youd-

   s all right-s all right put in mr
hartshorn quickly dont you go gettin
excited an givin away no family histries
now mullaneys a square guy for a dick
an ill turn a little deal to satisfy him he
added magnanimously

  there was a brief pause during which
mr hartshorns eyes seemed to grow still
smaller and turn in until they finally
merged into one

  besides he continued bitterly itll
be nuts to me to even up on them swell guns
between them an burglar alarms its
gettin so there aint no profit in the game
no more

  why tom didnt lose his position in the
day which followed was one of those mys-
teries for which there is apparently no
earthly explanation when he wasnt
thinking of the chetwynd emeralds lying
there in that isolated old house among the
whispering eucalyptus he was busy pictur-
ing a face surrounded by pale gold hair-
hair with a curious frosty light in the waves
and the clearest and steadiest of gray eyes
the real-estate business was simply no-
where

  one ticklish bit of business tom accom-
plished that day in a way which caused
him to address an insultingly patronizing
glance at the pictured napoleon over his
desk he asked permission to take out
one of the firms touring cars volunteering
the elastic information that he wanted to
show some people the country the sales
manager but half-listening had grunted a
reply to this little request-a noise which
the young man chose to interpret as affable
acquiescence

the night was just the sort he
would have ordered for the business
in hand-a night apparently just
come up from the pit a heavy fog rolling
in from the ocean blotting out the stars
its very density seeming to muffle the voice
and stop the ears with cotton it hung
like a curtain over the highway penetrating
with a wet chill which caused helen mercer
unconsciously to draw closer to the resolute
young man at the steering-wheel while
honest bill in the tonneau slunk deeper
in the collar of his overcoat and cursed tom
mullaney the swell guns and the chet-
wynd emeralds with true democratic im-
partiality

  little was said on the way down a few


adventure

short directions the girl gave when the roads
branched removing one hand-she had
tucked them both into the opposite coat
sleeve muff - fashion - to designate the
course

  down the san bruno road around the
curving hills where the great invisible bay
lapped below them the machine hummed
along its headlights boring into the wall
of fog forever rising twenty feet ahead

  the clock on the cowlboard showed
eleven when they reached the bumpy dirt
roud leading west from the highway ever
since they had left san mateo behind the
girl had been at tension now she was
sitting bolt upright on the edge of the seat
her eyes staring fixedly into the fog ahead
her hair clung to her face in wet rings
as tom could see from the corners of his
eyes

  his heart suddenly throbbed with the
joy of being alive-what romance riding
with a beautiful girl beside him with an
ex-cracksman in the rear seat and a loaded
gun in his pocket on his way to pick the
safe of an exclusive crooks club darla-
gnan and monte cristo owed him nothing
at all

  the girls hand slipped suddenly over
his on the wheel she leaned closer until
her breath was warm on his cheek

  youd better get out now and let me
drive the car in alone the house is right
up there behind some trees quick before
some one comes

  they had thoroughly agreed upon their
course of action before they started but
tom now hesitated even while he slipped
from behind the wheel the girl beside him
had suddenly ceased to be a novel heroine
in his mind she was simply helen mercer
and the young fellow found that the thought
of letting her venture alone into that nest
of dangerous men filled him with panic

  helen-do you think youd better
dont you think after all its wisest for you
to stay with the car and let bill and me
take our chances on getting in alone

  for a long moment the girl in the drivers
seat looked down into his eyes through the
dusk the torture of uncertainty playing over
her face once she opened her lips with a
little impetuous gasp as though to tell him
something then she shut it resolutely and
the gray eyes wavered and jerked away

  youre awfully good to run into this
danger-for me

  she said it very softly her little gloved
hand suddenly seized one of his and pressed
it for a brief second to the cold curve of her
cheek then the wheel was jerked around
and tom found himself in the dripping
shelter of a tree watching the disappearing
red tail-light

  say boss honest bills voice sounded
in the ear helen mercers breath had
warmed and woke tom with a start from
his rapturous reverie wed better be
moseying we want to get in while the
portugee is takin the lady in

  tom morosely agreed all the romance
of the thing was gone now he hated him-
self for having countenanced this mad
scheme he was afraid-horribly afraid
for the girl to thunder with the chet-
wynd emeralds and to thunder with hoyt 
brainards as well if helen mercer was
harmed tom knew that all the emeralds in
jebel sikait could never remove one atom
of self-reproach from his heart what a
fool he had been-what an infatuated ass

  he was still calling himself names when
they came in sight of the house it loomed
a gray ghost out of the fog just as helen
had so carefully described it before they
came here not a splinter of light shone
from the shutters one window whose
shutter had long since joined the dear
departed glistened blankly at them in
hypocritical innocence

  it was hard to believe that all the de
quincey dreams of splendor could be con-
cealed behind the weatherbeaten walls
hard to think that the cleverest crooks
on the pacific coast were gathered together
within and that into their midst a calm-
browed frightened-hearted girl was ven-
turing alone

  tom nearly groaned aloud then sud-
denly stiffened it was too late to change
matters now the only thing which re-
mained was to see it through as well as
might be he left the path and slipped
between the trees closely followed by the
cracksman

  around to the back of the house they
felt their way for they had decided to
enter by one of the upper windows the
boarded-up window in the room adjoining
the safe was more direct but infinitely
more risky here the fog was so dense that
they could just make out the headlights
of the machine stopped on the path before
them carefully they edged themselves
emeralds and blondie



out of the radius of the lights into the
shelter of the eucalyptus tree whose
branches scraped the sagging upper veranda

  even as they reached it they heard the
girl on the porch softly humming the same
strain which trevillion had whistled that
other night

  up die tree

  tom breathed it close to honest bills
ear the cracksman nodded with pitying
contempt he had already grasped the
smooth trunk with his arms and was
perched in the branches above like some
outrageous bird before tom had taken
more than two struggling heaves up the
trunk not a sound had escaped though
to the young mans excited imagination
his own breathing sounded like the
whistling of the overland mail below
the girl still hummed her plaintive little air
one hand pressed tightly to her pounding
heart

  when he reached the branch where the
cracksman perched tom was aware that
the door below had opened and helen
mercer had disappeared the rotting ver-
anda stretched before them piled high
with many years accumulation of fallen
leaves tom was grateful for the drenching
fog which had made them sodden on a
clear dry night they would have rustled and
crackled like so much tissue-paper under
their feet

  a row of shuttered windows stared back
sullenly at them mute testimony of the old
hospitable days when each had sheltered
a guest and the house had been the center
of social life for the surrounding ranchos

     very veranda slouched in a furtive way
like a spineless fellow who resents the
memories of more respectable times but
however rotten the floor the honest beams
held true beneath their cautious feet no
warning creak complained of their weight

honest bills figure had a brief
moment before merged into the
dark background of the house and
even as tom tiptoed up he had noiselessly
forced the shutters on one window and was
busy with the old-fashioned lock on the
sash hartshorns little eyes were almost
crossed in his acute enjoyment to jimmy
the very stronghold of his high-class com-
petitors to outwit them by the clumsy
methods they despised-it was his idea
of the most exquisite humor

  the long unused window started to
protest audibly at this midnight disturbing
of its slumber but after being soothed by a
few drops from honest bills oil-can it slid
smoothly open and they slipped over the
sill into the room beyond

  the two men melted away from the
dangerous square of light and stood silently
for a moment listening apparently the
whole upper floor was unused at least
that part which faced the outside of the
house it was as helen had guessed only
the heart of the building was used in order
to keep up to the passer-by the camouflage
of its one isolated tenant

  they felt their way noiselessly around the
dark room to where instinct told them a
door should let on the upper hall the
room was semi-furnished in the style of
the os a walnut highboy bare of any
trinkets caught tom a nasty crack on the
knee and a dark mass in one comer peril-
ously like an unusually tall man sent his
hand jerking back to his hip-pocket until
his straining eyes told him that it was only
a roll of carpet propped against the wall

  then came the soft scraping of a key
in a long-unturned lock and the young
fellow caught his breath nervously as he
stepped into the hall beside the cracksman
the blood was tearing through his veins at
an alarming rate he had the curious sense
of being a spectator instead of an actor in
this mad scheme he had staged of watching
the body of tom fleming steal and swagger
his way through an impossible novel
instead of a situation of real life he
wondered if helen had this same oddly
detached feeling the thought of her
steadied him and made him realize the
gravity of it all for helens sake as well
as their own they must find the emeralds
and get away quickly

  hurry-hurry he found himself
breathing it impatiently to the dark figure
beside him

  honest bill nodded offendedly what
did he mean-hurry did this guy
think he was stopping to drink a cup of tea

  the steep bare stairs quaked once as they
cautiously felt their way by the old-fash-
ioned banister and toms heart quaked in
sympathy followed a hair-whitening
period when both flattened themselves to
the wall and their hands crept to the com-
forting bulge of the automatics in their
pockets


adventure

  two-three minutes passed the dark-
nesss was unshattered by any warning
burst of light in the room-evidently
the kitchen at the end of the hall-they
could hear the portuguese moving about
on the bare floor a subdued sound of
voices came from one of the center rooms-
evidently beyond those cracked and stained
white plaster walls was the eastern luxury
helen had described

  again a start was made and they finally
stood unmolested in the lower hall the
voices were louder now once tom was
sure he heard the girls clear treble followed
by a smothered burst of appreciative
laughter his heart swelled with both
pride and fear the little brick-she was
playing up to her part

  only for a moment they hesitated-that
lower hall was too dangerous at any
moment the kitchen door might be opened
exposing them to the view of the portuguese
watch

  one two three-the girl had said the
third door from the front of the house led
to the room containing the safe tom
gently tried the knob and it turned in his
hand the room was not even locked

  a sudden realization of the terrible power
cleete must have over those clever crooks
to leave this valuable place unprotected
smote tom anew and caused him to break
out in a gentle but profuse perspiration
he was dimly aware that honest bill had
drawn his gun and as he opened the door
an infinitesimal crack he followed suit
almost prayerfully grateful for the com-
forting feel of the cold steel

  luck played into their hands this room
was dark its only fight sifting in from the
narrow opening between the velvet cur-
tains which clothed a second entrance
prepared as he was by helens recital the
barbaric loveliness of the room nearly
carried away the young fellows breath
it served to fill the cracksman with fresh
resentment this luxury was like flaunting
the obsoleteness of his own methods in
honest bills face and in return he looked
around for the safe vindictively

  tom stole on tiptoe to the opening in the
curtains and looked through

  he had always supposed the poet who
described abou ben adhems room as being
rich and like a lily in bloom was press-
agenting at the time now the line in-
stinctively floated into his head

  beneath the mica shades of the seven
suspended lamps the room beyond ap-
peared to glow and throb with color like
the heart of a rich sapphire even helens
half-awed description had not done it
justice the intense blue of the hanging
the rich background of the rugs fairly pulsed
with the exquisite shade yet so softly so
deeply that the eye was not offended but
drank it in appreciatively

  above in glorious contrast glowed the
vases the depthless carmine gleam of the
pigeon-blood cloissones the strange rich
tones of the others with their contrasting
blacks and ivories and inimitable rare blues

  merely to glimpse them was to under-
stand in some slight degree the strange man
whose passion they were crook he might
be-driven by the insatiable lust of posses-
sion-but artist he- certainly was then
toms eyes fell on the group beyond and
his fascinated admiration was wiped from
his mind

sp helen mercer was enthroned
duui hi one of the ebony chairs whose
somber black velvet outlined her
dainty slimness with the clean-cut lines of
a cameo her cheeks were high with color
even the pale gold hair about her face
seemed vividly alive her hands moved
animatedly as she illustrated her tale to
the little knot of men clustered about her
it was evident to the watchful young man
behind the curtain that she was playing
her part under a terrible tension

  a tall young man in evening clothes
looked down regarding her with such
obvious admiration in his narrowed black
eyes that toms fingers instinctively curled
into fists at that moment he hated tre-
villion more cordially than all the rest of
them put together

  the gay little ripple of the girls con-
versation had caught even cleetes interest
tom recognized him at once from helens
description he was standing slightly apart
undeniably commonplace in appearance
appearing more like a divinity student than
ever his mild blue eyes twinkling appre-
ciatively behind his thick glasses as the
girl reached the point in her story and the
little group of men broke into a soft roar

  under cover of the next remark from
trevillion the girl shot a quick glance
toward the curtained doorway a fright-
ened anguished attempt to pierce the
emeralds and blondie



narrow line of gloom in the center and dis-
cover if the two men had reached it yet

  the next minute she had flashed back a
whimsical retort and the animated smile
again played over her face

  if any impetus had been needed by tom
to hurry that momentary dropping of the
mask would have done it his eyes were
jerked to the cracksman motionless beside
the safe except for his long twisting fingers
which turned the combination with in-
cessant patience his ear flattened to the
lock to catch the faint click of the mechan-
ism as it fell in place

  a very agony of helpless impatience
seized the young man at the sight of that
crouching figure apparently accomplishing
nothing while the precious minutes went by
and the girl played her dangerous game
unaided in the room beyond he plunged
his twitching hands deep in the pockets of
his coat grateful when they found and
closed about the handle of the automatic

  now once again the romance of the thing
had faded leaving a terrible fear in its
stead he realized only too clearly the
noose into which they had run their heads
they were as much alone in this isolated
house as if they stood in the middle of the
mohave desert and the young man did not
deceive himself as to their probable fate
if this mad attempt should be discovered

  he checked an imploring whisper to the
cracksman to work faster for a wavering
moment he even contemplated flight with-
out the emeralds-anything to get the girl
away from this house of fear then he
gulped and took himself severely in hand
it would never do to have a fit of nerves
now he must play it as gamely as helen
was doing

  again he turned back to the yellow slit
in the curtains the movement set them
swaying ever so slightly and the single
sharp glance the girl sent under cover of a
remark from the man called clieve showed
that the girl had interpreted it correctly
even at that distance tom saw the color
seep slowly from her face then as slowly
flood it again he cast another glance
behind him at that shadowy figure before
the safe the cracksman had seemingly
not moved his head was still flattened
against the door the fingers slowly turn-
ing - turning - apparently accomplishing
nothing

 god-couldnt he hurry tom felt a

hysterical desire to shriek aloud for haste
the next moment his forehead went cold
and wet cleete had left the little group
and was walking stright across the room
toward him for one terrible moment
the young man stood spellbound unable to
speak or give warning to the unconscious
cracksman behind him hardly daring to
believe that those enlarged blue eyes behind
the thick lenses had not glimpsed him
through the slit in the curtains he was
aware that helen mercers stricken face
had taken notice of cleetes departure and
his own anguished emotions seemed but a
continuation of her own

  it was not until cleete was half-way
across the room that the spell was broken
tom took two steps back to the kneeling
figure

  quick-hide some ones coming-

  even as he said it came a crash and a cry
loud and clear to carry its message to him

  oh mr cleete-your vase-i dropped
it that splendid new vase you were show-
ing me-	i

  tom risked a second dash to the slit
between the curtains helens quick wit
had saved them a priceless cloisonne lay
on the polished floor at her feet its enamel
chipped and loosened cleete everything
else wiped from his mind by this tragedy
of one of his precious vases had turned his
back upon the little room and was fairly
racing back to the ruin she had wrought

  fine-oh fine some one inside of
toms body seemed to be applauding the
girls act some one who appreciated the
dramatic side of this breath-taking situation

  then the cold-blooded critic was screamed
down by the rest of his mind tom found
himself towering over the crouching figure
of the cracksman

  hurry-hurry-for gods sake-hurry
he was repeating it inanely his finger-nails
biting into the palms for emphasis

  the noise without had increased beyond
its well-bred repression another voice-
that of the portuguese-could be heard
raised apparently in protestation

  the cracksman suddenly straightened
with a little gasp of triumph the safe
handle turned in his grip the door swung
open into the dark interior a flashlight
gleamed for a breaths space greenly and
wickedly the twin emeralds seemed to leap
at the intruders before toms fingers closed
about them


adventure

  the flash winked out the men flung
themselves face about their hands leaping
to their pockets

	the curtains before the entrance were
swaying the yellow slit of light had dis-
appeared some one had slipped into the
room

viii

for a brief moment both men
held their tense positions revolvers
drawn and pointed in the direction
of the frightened breathing then a whis-
per came across the room

  tom-are you there

  helen toms voice was husky

  a shadowy figure glided from its corner
and ran lightly across the room to them

  quick-somethings happened weve
got to go antonio-the portuguese-came
in and im afraid hes found me out i
didnt wait-i slipped in here-quick out
the window

  as her words tumbled over each other
in her panic she was steadily steering him
to the further end of the room where a
velvet hanging pushed aside revealed a
bare unfurnished room as poverty-stricken
as the others which bordered the outside of
the house this was the room opening
on to the shallow front veranda the room
of the broken window pane the girl was
shaking with fright and excitement the
cold night air striking chilly on her arms
and neck left bare by the little satin evening
dress she wore

  the window-quick before they miss
me

  the cracksman was already tugging at
the sash hesitating to smash the glass and
bring the whole pack about their ears
above the rising excitement in the other
room a voice was raised shrilly in anger-
a girls voice

  what the devil does this mean why
cant i come in the voice grew louder
evidently the owner had forced her way
into the room i tell this-this idiot-
it was evidently the portuguese who was
thus flatteringly designated-who i am
and he says im already here

  here cleetes soft voice cut in-gentle
and chilly

  in reply the girls angry voice rose
louder

who am i im blondie travers
whats this trash about me being down

here the other night i never was here
before in my life ive been two days
trying to find this place from the infernal
description riddle gave me emeralds
she laughed scornfully fat chance i got
at those emeralds oh i was there all
right-i lifted them too

  it was like taking gumdrops from the
baby but i couldnt get away quick
enough that fat woman discovered they
were gone and before i could get through
the beastly crush the entrances were
guarded they were starting to search
people too and believe me i wasnt
waiting for any aftermaths-i dropped
them and beat it so they wouldnt be found
near me

  oh i had my credentials for being there
riddle saw to that-but the confounded
emeralds werent found on the floor or any
place else they were gone-melted-
vamoosed it didnt dawn on me until
tonight that they must have caught on
some ones clothes and then i heard-oh
never mind how you people here havent
a corner on all the information in the
world-that i-that is blondie came
down to this place with the chetwynd
emeralds somebodys been stringing you
where is this other girl whos been pre-
tending to be me

  the rapid high-pitched voice was inter-
rupted by a crash tom throwing caution
to the winds with that last remark had
snatched off his coat and wrapping it about
his arm swept the sash clean of glass
even as the sound of running footsteps
sounded in the room beyond almost
before his arm was drawn back honest
bill leaped through the empty frame with
the agility of a cat tom lifted the girl
half-dead with fright after him and then
swung himself over the sill on to the
veranda

  he groaned aloud when he remembered
that their machine was in the back the
lights turned out and the engine probably
cold by now a groan which changed to a
grunt of relief an automobile stood before
the house its headlights pointing back in
the direction of the road a car whose
excited driver had forgotten to turn the
engine off

  the door of the house burst open behind
them even as he flung himself behind the
wheel a flash lit the black space and a
bullet whined close by his head shouting
emeralds and blondie



to the other two to crouch upon the floor
of the tonneau tom lurched over the wheel
and slammed the machine into gear she
started with a jerk and tore down the road
the long rows of trees flying on each side
of him

  there was a maddening moment while
they were forced to slack speed to work
the mechanism of the gate and in recog-
nition of their disadvantage came another
burst of flame and another bullet sang its
deathly song near them trevillions aim
was getting too good regardless of
the rough unkept condition of the road
tom reeled the speedometer up to fifty
keeping himsqlf from being bounced from
the seat by a savage grip on the wheel

  he could hear nothing for the whistling
of the wind as they cut through but it was
just before they swung on to the smooth
asphalt highway that a scream came from
helen-

  theyre coming in our car

  a third shot whizzed by

  the young fellow shut his teeth hard
and pulled the wheel around turning a
corner at thirty an hour thanking his stars
for the nonskid tires the fog had dis-
appeared now the stars were glittering
coldly overhead watching his chance
when he dared the young man reached
down and switched off the tail-light but
the others had already sighted them and
bore down at terrific speed

  a few late machines were passed some
at a narrow margin one driver yelling
angrily and swinging his car sharply into
the dirt as they grazed his fender

  evidently they were being taken for a joy
party with more of a capacity for liquor
than caution

  helen was kneeling on the floor of the
tonneau her eyes glued to the lights of
the oncoming machine while she yelled
their progress to tom having to put her
face close to his shoulder to make her voice
carry over the rushing of the wind the
other car with trevillion at the wheel
and cleete and the man clieve in the back
seat bore down on them along the dark
highway like some fire-spouting monster

  at san bruno another machine bound
in the same direction loomed before them
and tom took a desperate chance reach-
ing over without slacking speed he
switched out his headlights plunging the

highway into thick blackness then he


flungthe wheel violently over and swung
into the lonely branch road leading up
the peninsula there was a chance that
their pursuers would follow the other car
up the highway but this hope was shat-
tered when on the desolate wide salt marsh
over which the road stretched a fourth
shot was fired this time striking the ground
close behind them the marksman was
attempting to blow out their rear tires

  tom groaned he had taken the worst
possible course at this time in the
morning the san bruno road was prac-
tically deserted only the sprawling little
town of south city-dark at this hour-
breaking the dreary landscape of salt
marsh and barren hills on the highway
the crooks would not have dared to fire
for fear of drawing undesired attention
upon themselves on this lonely road the
few people on the little dismal farms who
might hear the shots would not be inclined
to investigate

a railroad-crossing loomed
ahead and even as they came upon
it the warning bell told of the train
further down the track its headlights
already splitting the darkness a quick
hope rose in toms heart that the other
machine would be halted by that long
string of freight cars he stepped hard
on the throttle and the car bounded over
the tracks grazed by the descending gates

  a little cry was wrung from the girl
then came a groan from the cracksman
and the other car suddenly appeared in
the fierce headlight of the puffing engine
crashing through the gates as if they had
been so much tissue paper bits of broken
glass and splinters of white wood dancing
in the dazzling light of the lamps

  now tom hit it up until the speedometer
reached the  mark his arms ached
with keeping the machine to the center
of the road his headlights were snapped
on-at that speed he needed every caution
the car rocked and swayed with the bumps
in the asphalt the wind even with the
protection of the wind-shield filling their
nostrils and mouths as if with water
making them fight for each breath

  another shot glanced off the ground
behind them then another the car had
started the climb of the hills now the road
lined on one side by cliffs towering into
barren peaks above on the right aslope
i

adventure

down to the dark waters of the back bay

  around curves tom was forced to slack
speed to a certain extent for the hills jutted
in great raw walls about which he swept
cut-out open siren shrieking madly then
helen made a discovery and yelled it to
tom from their superior altitude she
could see the pursuing car catching
glimpses as it rounded the curves after
them-not more than this-a light was
following them coming with a speed
which matched and surpassed either of the
machines

  police screamed tom in explanation
and stepped on the throttle harder

  around curves he was fairly safe the
pursuers uncomfortably close now could
not take good aim but a long level stretch
over the top of the grade appeared and in
answer a rain of shot struck the ground
behind them the girls scream seemed
but an echo of the concussion of air and as
if in continuation came an explosion twice
as loud

  theyve got us

  tom felt a terrible tugging on his arms
and realized with a sudden stab of fear
that this time the marksmans aim was
true one of their rear tires had blown
out the car careened madly to the right
and the young man threw all his strength
to straightening the wheel from right
to left and back she swung their rear
wheels defining a perfect half-arc then
he realized with a sick horror that the front
wheels were hanging over space-seemed
to hang there for a terrible eternity then
the car slowly toppled over and toms last
conscious thought was a feeling of mild
surprise that there was no echoing crash
nothing but a swimming blackness and an
odd numbness in his arms-and oblivion

  out of the blackness grew a star an odd
green star which slowly turned golden and
whirled with frightful speed on one point
a deep voice somewhere was repeating
making it rich and like a lily in bloom
which was so obviously ridiculous when
taken in connection with everything else
that his eyes fluttered open for a mo-
ment his thoughts were entirely concerned
with the other stars-there were millions
of them all crowding and elbowing each
other for room in his bedroom ceiling

  then he became slowly aware that he was
wretchedly cold that what should have
been his bed was oddly hard and stony

and that his bedroom ceiling was really
the sky after that memory rushed back
he was shaken slightly nauseated but
miraculously alive close beside him some
one was crying softly and repeating his
name he made an effort to lurch upright
dimly conscious of a stabbing pain in his
side and found himself looking unsteadily
into helen mercers eyes the girls hair
was tumbled over her shoulders in a pale
gold mass her eyes shone with tears in the
starlight toms eyes traveled jerkily
down her little satin evening dress liter
ally torn to ribbons

 you-youre hurt he asked it
hoarsely

  she shook her head

  it was the top-the top saved us we
turned over on our side but the top saved us
from turning turtle oh tom-you arent
hurt-are you-are you-

  her concern caused the young man to
put his unsteady arms about her and draw
her face feebly to his it seemed the most
natural thing in the world to do and quite
as simply the girl kissed him back

  it was a minute before he looked around
they seemed to be in a ditch-the machine
a wreck in the starlight sprawled bulkily
beside them the other car had com-
pletely disappeared

  honest bill tom exploded it

  helen looked at him with fear and
remorse in her eyes it was the first time
they had either one thought of the cracks-
man he might be pinned under the car
dying at this very moment

  tom i never thought to look i guess
i fainted for a minute and when i came to
i was so worried about you oh tom-
you look-i dont dare

  bitterly reproachful at his selfish over-
sight tom dragged himself unsteadily to
his feet and stumbled over to the toppled
car he might have saved himself the
trouble

  honest bill was gone

  so were the emeralds

hey all right down there
the up-fiare of a flashlight slanted
for a moment on the face of a motor-
cycle policeman rather ludicrously poked
over the edge of the cliff before it came to
focus on their upturned heads

  all right for a funeral tom croaked

  that stabbing pain in his side again
emeralds and blondie



hurting cruelly as he drew his breath

  the officer eased himself beside them
made sure that they were in no immediate
danger of passing to the happy hunting
grounds then looked grimly over the
wrecked machine

  his wrath increased as his anxiety for
them subsided

  this is no place nor no time to start
lecturing but by way of a tip the speed-
limit on this road is thirty an hour not
sixty

  the girl burst out hysterically

  but you dont understand-those others
were right behind us-

  racing aint no excuse the officer
said it more in weariness than in anger
your joy-riding pals got away-i let em
go to come back and look for you when i
saw you go over the bank

  got away-they got away tom tot-
tered a couple of steps in disappointed
anger those crooks got away-

  the sudden movement sent that shooting
pain through his side again and he caught
his breath with a stab he saw helens
anxious white face appear unaccountably
above his own and became aware that the
officer with sudden apprehension had leaped
to his assistance again the familiar little
green star began to bum in his brain

 oh-

  a voige very weak and very far away
yet undisputably his own said it calmly
and deliberately then the whole world
went out in a blinding flash of pain

  at half-past nine the next morning
motorcycle officer bixbee walked into a
ward of the san mateo county hospital
with a curt but friendly nod to the golden-
haired girl whose anxious eyes barely left
the bandaged figure of the young man on
the bed

  in answer to toms mute question the
officer shook his head disappointed

  no use-i guess we lost out oh not
so far as the emeralds go he amended
quickly if as you say honest bill got
away with em well get em back by night
the san francisco police are already on
his trail there was contempt in the
policemans tone but its the others-
the club too bad you and the young lady
wasnt in shape to tell us about em last
night we could have nabbed the whole

bunch my thinking they were a joy-
riding party and you fainting just as you
was going to tell about em threw me off
the track

  as soon as the young lady here recovered
enough to tell blake about it a bunch of us
went down there we found the house just
as she said-lord some joint wasnt it-
but they was all gone-even the bohunk
left in quite some hurry from the looks
of things rugs in a heap safe door swing-
ing open and the safe itself as clean as a
whistle not a scrap of paper left to give
a clue neither found your car down there
shes some splashed with mud and the lamps
are battered up but that was the only thing
they overlooked that wasnt nailed down

  for several minutes after the officer had
left tom lay with closed eyes motionless
except for the rise and fall of the bed-
clothes over his chest

  the girl thought that he was sleeping and
tiptoed gently from the room but toms
brain was doing double-quick time and his
mental vision was not exactly reassuring
it had taken the form of a huge ledger with
these entries on the debit side

    two broken ribs

    a borrowed machine slightly banged up

     one suit ot clothes simply nowhere

  and vague but grimly dominating the
future

     what were they going to say at the office

  the total was too staggering tom
opened his eyes in self-defense and fixed
them unblinkingly on the white plaster
ceiling

  then out of his pandoras box of
troubles came this little ray of comfort
the kinetoscopic events of the past few days
whirled colorfully through his brain once
more his nerves thrilled to the gun-play as
they plunged from the fatal club house
to the terrible moments of the mad dash up
the peninsula once more he reached the
acme of excitement as the machine hung
for that eternity over the edge of the bank

  the unquenchable spark of the bom
adventurer gleamed in the young fellows
eyes and he broke into a grin

  anyway he gloated within himself
that was one time in my life when i was
living in high gear
a few camp-fires ago harrison r
howard of our writers brigade sent
us a brief greeting as he took ship for france
here is a word from him now a sergeant in

other side with a couple of clauses clipped
out by the censor

   its been a long trail since last i had opportunity
of writing you a trail fraught with excitement and
bizarre pleasures    cut theres an exhilaration
in it all even the drudgery that makes for enthu-
siasm and gets things done in super-american style

t tnless one is among that chosen few who are
said to think internationally as it were it is
impossible back there in america to realize the
magnitude of this noiseless engine for general ac-
complishment this american expeditionary force
which is working twenty-four hours a day over
here to the neophyte at his first glance to the
white light a breath-taker as the west has it
those magic letters-a e f they mean a world
a literal world a buzzing hive of activity but the
censor commands that its song in detail must re-
main unsung-yet a while  to look into a camp-
fire doubtless things are going on as usual back
there in the states but its difficult to believe it
from here it seems that america must be in a fev-
erish state of activity so accustomed have we be-
come to it over here

at one of our camp-fires edgar
young started something by asking
what is the spirit of adventure particu-
larly as considered biologically also an-
other of our comrades earl j teets said
hed been knocking around a good deal but
had never met adventure and is there any
such animal one of the replies-to both
inquirers-is given below from charles
beadle who like edgar young belongs to
our writers brigade

grand isle la

  my dear camp-fire-the question that edgar
young sets is most interesting i should rather like
to have a shot at it yet it is such a mighty big
question to propound the definition of the spirit of
adventure that i am going to hedge by as politely
as possible inquiring what may be the spirits of
love sex attraction and hunger for does she
not hunt with the same pack

biologically i should say that adventure
not the magazine with due respect is as impor-
tant as her i say her advisedly because she is so
entrancing to a male two sisters in the evolution of
man the purpose of definition is best served per-
haps on the principle of a pound of fact is worth etc
by a simile it is easy to imagine that some primeval
person of the crustacea family thoroughly enjoyed
his meals whatever they were also his mate who-
ever she was is it inconceivable that the sand
crab owed its existence to that very spirit of ad-
venture worrying innumerable ancestors into finding
out what was going on in that interesting land the
beach and in another element air

theres something lost behind the sand-dunes

  go and find it

sang the crustacean kipling get me

  as for the second regarding intellectual adventure
is not this question answered by edgar young
the impulse which prompted him to ask the ques-
tion is the lady herself

as for earl j teets i would say in all comrade-
ship that i suspect that he has sailed in con-
sort with jj s s adventure many a time and oft
but that he has mislaid his signal-book has he
never for example felt a thrill during line of bat-
tle-even at maneuvres if so let him know that
that was a promise of the kisses to come and for
a recipe let him take when he be free this recipe
which like the patent medicine unsolicited testi-
monials i may recommend from personal experi-
ence take one map of the- world and with eyes
blindfolded stab seven times note countries pierced
take a coin and toss and reduce same to one go to
that one never mind how but go if he doesnt
find adventure the lord help him i can not-

all american citizens are drawn from
two sources-children and immigrants
if you want clear water in a barrel there
isnt much use in trying anything else until
youve stopped or clarified any streams of
dirty water that may be flowing into the
barrel to put the matter baldly both the
streams that fill the barrel of american
citizenship are pretty muddy there is no
sense in blaming the streams for being dirty
it is our job to keep them clean

  what do we do to keep these two streams
dean to ensure good american citizens in-
stead of bad what have you ever done
toward it

nphe american league for citizenship
has been incorporated to afford the
means of united effort toward this end to
install the teaching of real citizenship in all
our schools and to limit immigration to
what we can really absorb and to what will
not merely pollute the water in our barrel

tit ere is a letter from stephen chalmers
j- a comrade of our writers brigade the
following i pumped out of him in the course
of a long conversation on immigration and
citizenship in general he was a british
subject a scotchman even though he had
lived in this country quite a number of
years he would not ask for american citi-
zenship until he felt he had been here long
enough to be really assimilated sufficiently
understanding of american ideals to be a
really worthy citizen of the country to which
he intended to transfer his allegiance do
you get the full force of it this immigrant
would not accept american citizenship until
he felt he was worthy of it our laws giving
citizenship to many who are not worthy of
it this immigrant takes the responsibility

and the ideals into his own hands and makes
sure that in at least one case the united
states of america does not get a citizen who
is unworthy

	i hat is very splendid but doesnt it

     make you one of those who determine
our laws and policies rather ashamed that
the vote of this clean american citizen or
of a native-born american is nullified by
the vote of some unworthy immigrant who
should never have been given citizenship
say for example some german who has
since been using his american citizenship as
a means of hurting america and helping her
enemy germany the perjury of his broken
oath of allegiance to us not even being pun-
ished his american citizenship not even
taken from him

  who determines whether such things
shall be the politicians no you and
i and the rest of the hundred million ameri-
cans who hold the fundamental power al-
ways the politicians can do only what we
let them do you can argue a thousand
years but you can never shake that fact
you can fail to use your share of the funda-
mental control you can dodge your duty
and be a dead weight and parasite but you
can never free yourself of the responsibility

  if our immigration laws are faulty if
some of our immigrants pollute the water in
our barrel yon are one of those who are to
blame

	i here are many remedies that might

     be applied mr chalmers letter sets
forth one of them that merits your serious
consideration-if you are a real american
a real believer in democracy not a parasite
a shirker or something worse

saranac lake n y march 

     you know my feeling in this matter i ob-
ject to the walk-up of illiterate citizens who get first
papers without a deep realization of what they are
doing during the next five years their environ-
ment is not always conducive to proper thinking and
when they get second papers they are too often
under the influence of this environment and are
worse than no citizens at all

   i would like to see the law changed to at least two
years before any concession is granted and then
only under the strictest examination as to integrity
intelligence understanding of citizenship record in
the interval to be supplied by pastor rabbi dis-
trict police-what you please in short even as
somebody or other served seven years for ruth-
and then some-make prospective would-be citizens
regard citizenship as a prize to be won and worth
winningl	-

  every vote of a bad citizen is destructive of the
vote of a good citizen and surely the american bom

in connection with his story in
this issue hugh pendexter gives us a
little historical dope

  i have taken st clairs spelled sainclair in the
old ballads defeat and waynes victory over the
northwestern confederacy for the background of
this yarn the invitation to war was given by red
belts strings and red sticks the latter commonly
being used by the creeks and their cousins the
scminoles and radiating from them up the mis-
sissippi valley

  a hidatsa indian living in dakota in  was
held by the indians to be a mighty magician be-
cause of his trick of producing red ripe cherries from
his mouth at any season it is supposed he pre-
served them in whisky he was known as cherry-
in-the-mouth as its never to my knowledge
been played up in fiction i have transposed the trick
back to  for a white man to play

out narrating in detail the fact the indian

the limited scope of the short story to sketch the
horror caused by st clairs defeat and the ter-
rible possibilities for lonely cabin or settlement any-
where north of the ohio the indians turning
back with their white prisoner instead of pressing
on to the ohio is true to life as their service was
purely voluntary and they could quit at any time
without losing caste or inviting punishment-

one of the few unwritten laws of our
camp-fire is that when it comes to
printing we devitalize cuss-words by using
dashes to indicate them and the same rule
holds in our fiction stories but perhaps
some of you noticed that in a recent serial
for the flag we let one cuss-word go as
it lay the following letter to me from the
author explains the exception

richmond va

   i want to ask while i think of it one special favor
regarding the story

  in chapter  billy smith in speaking to the
german minister of the kaiser says to hell
with him and all his brood

  now billy means this with all his heart when he

says it he doesnt mean to-with him he

means to hell with the murdering scoundrel
i myself meant it when i wrote it and im surethat
it echoes your personal sentiments so i beg of you
-please-to let the word stand when the story goes
to print and thereby bring mild comfort to the souls
of the men who read it and who in concert with you
and me could voice what they feel in far stronger

terms if it were permissible to put them in type

   i understand why as a rule you dont let down
the bars to maledictory expressions in adventure
but heres a case when the exception cries aloud for
admission and with a world-wide reason to stand
upon-thomas addison

  i dont believe youll blame me for mak-
ing an exception of this case though even
where the full strength of the cussing is so
strongly called for we cant keep up this
exception business for example person-
ally i have no brief for the kaiser unless it
is that maybe hes insane or the helpless
tool of still worse men i can in his case get
along with nothing more than dashes but
when it comes to ludendorff the crown
prince hindenburg and tirpitz it strains
me a bit to be limited by clashes if mr
addison can fill em in for the kaiser why
shouldnt i be granted exceptions in these
other cases so there it goes mr addi-
sons exception mustnt be considered a
precedent or all the rest of us will be claim-
ing equal privilege

tf your magazine is late in reaching

transportation conditions before hopping
on to us because of war conditions were
starting the magazine out a week or ten days
earlier then formerly but troops ammunition

ping is necessarily disturbed in many ways

on the opposite page are some old
friends of ours w c tuttle who
introduced us to ike magpie and the rest
of their bunch used to be a cartoonist on
a spokane daily last christmas through
his kind offices i received a snap-shot of
magpie et al by way of greeting along
with my thanks i ventured a regret that
half-mile smith and dirty-shirt jones had
so conspicuously slighted me and later was
delighted to receive via mr tuttles pen
a photo from piperocks leading pho-
tographer it appears on page  and
bore on its back this legend

willingly posed for this photo they both send

 tjxdllowing our camp-fire custom
  gladys e johnson on the occasion of
 her first story in our magazine rises and in-
 troduces herself to us getting i know the
 friendly welcome we always have for the
 few women who gain membership in our
 writers brigade

   its a handicap being a woman that highly
 original remark is called into being by my nosing
 this little biography of mine in among the indian
 fighters the explorers and the knights of empire
 generally whose histories go to make up the camp-
 fire

 thrilling adventures have a way of side-
 stepping the female of the species as a usual
 thing its most discouraging all my life i have
 been trying to put myself in the way of thrillers
 only to have them jump clear over my head or burst
 into nothing at the most intense moment but in
 spite of my efforts the only thrilling adventure
 which has happened to me in the last two years was
 turning an automobile containing five people on its
 side while driving at forty-seven miles an hour
 even here my diabolical good luck stayed with me
 for miraculous as it sounds no one was even mussed
 up but at that my passengers on that occasion
 unanimously agreed that it was adventure enough
 for them

  since then though most of my spasmodic vaca-
tions have been spent in the mountains trying to
trap adventures-and the mountains of california
can be pretty wild-so far the cougars and griz-
zlies have been gentlemen enough to overlook me

t had the same good misfortune as a child

  youd think that a childhood spent largely in
logging-camps could boast some dramatic moments
but all i brought away was an unsatisfied longing
for excitement and a never-forgotten picture of that
beautiful wild california background

  i have found the dwelling-place of adventure
many times shortly after it moved out last sum-
mer i trailed it by the aid of gasoline through this
state down into mexico at a bull-fight in that
country i almost caught up with it but after the one
dramatic moment occasioned by the toro nearly
hooking a matador the bull-fight simmered down
to a rather tame affair-and im not bloodthirsty
either as evidenced by my nearly turning the car
over a second time to avoid a ground squirrel on the
road through the mojave desert

there was only one time when i was living on
all six cylinders and having the thrills of my
own heroes this was three years ago when i was
working on a san francisco newspaper having
too little patience and too much sense of the ridicu-
lous  graduated from sob-sister on the paper to
a sort of female troublc-hunter the paper em-
barked on several reform campaigns the most ex-
citing being an exxs of the fake fortune-tellers and
clairvoyants in this city as i was playing detec-
tive for the paper in an effort to obtain proof of their
bunco methods i for once had my fill of thrills
especially when i was trailed and eventually con-
fronted with my real identity in a clairvoyants
office for a moment i expected to have to do the
movie stunt of kicking the window out and jumping
on to an electric sign a story below for i was pretty
unpopular in that office right then afterward i
laughed to remember that in the excitement of the
moment i thought with true stage newspaper loy-
alty anyway itll look fine in the evening edi-
tions then once more fate backed down and i
was allowed to walk out of the door like any other
mortal

the newspaper work was the best sort of train-
ing for the fiction writing which i immediately
afterward took up i haunted the police-courts
and the waterfront and came in contact with some
curious and rather gruesome characters many an
idea for a story was bom while i listened to the
strange result of tracing down a news story to make a
feature out of it or stumbled over some novel and
haunting situation which had no news value

   a year of reporting and i took the jump-left the
paper and launched into the fiction game and now i
am putting my heroes through some of the strange
experiences  have heard and introducing into my
stories some of the queer people i have met

a fter all its pretty much of an adventure just
living in san francisco its the story-book
city with its chinatown its queer sordid greek
quarter its waterfront whose habitufis are re-
cruited from the seven seas its barbary coast and
its kearney street-the rialto of the adventurers

still bump into my hair-raising adventure-

a letter written some time ago from
one of our comrades who is finding
army life good for more than preparation
for fighting

  line  section e kelly field no  texas

  have been transferred from the medical depart-
ment to the aviation corps the rumor had it that
the detachmcnt at the base hospital was to re-
main until the end of the war and i got busy right
away applied for a transfer and through special
recommendation from my colonel received same in
six days

t find-hot and desolate in a way but we

   sure do not get a whole lot of time to worry
the thing that seems to worn- the boys here is that
they cant get to france quick enough and i cheer-
fully second the motion

  do i like the life in the army you bet i do it
has done me a whole lot of good in civilian life you
may be able to stay up nights and have a good time
and all that but i prefer this there is nothing like
getting up early in the morning feeling real good
it is the best and strictest school in the world this
army of ours and with the material we have on
hand and with the training they get to tell the
truth i cant see how the kaiser is going to win
this war

  i am expecting to be sent across in a very short
time trade tested for the camouflage section and
passed the test so i am expecting to get a pretty
dose view of the huns-carl g lindhult

txthen frank h huston talks about in-
 v dians he knows what hes talking
about heres a letter to us from him
which uncle frank labels as follows on
roping the legs and other maunders

   all squaws amongst the plains indians who con-
sidered virtue as an essential jewel roped them-
sdves the manner varied according to individual
taste and the necessities of the moment at times a
thong at ankles or knees allowing them to shuffle
along and at others an elaborate arrangement from
ankles to waist with variations an analogy may
be seen with the oriental custom of spiked belts anil
padlock with this difference the squaws roped for
self-protection as the penalty for violation of a
roped squaw was death no woman old or young
would leave the teepee without roping should they
do so it would be advertising that they were com-
mon property and a husband brother father or
son would stand by and see them used like soiled
doves without redress

jt should be understood that the teepee and
all pertaining to it even the travois and ponies
of burden were the property of the squaws all the
buck owned was his war-ponies clothes and weapons
of war and chase in the home the woman was su-
perior and could throw out the buck even a big

chief and chuck his possessions at his head as was
occasionally done not however if the buck was a
good provider as a protection against abuse the
squaw could and did even before her bucks eyes
propose that some other buck make up her dowry
and take her as his squaw

ya hat the whites called buying a wife was really
a form of the european dowry in some tribes
a suitor would tie his pony near his adoreds teepee
if she fed and watered it it was equivalent to saying
yes in others he left game at the entrance of the
teepee if she took it in and cooked it he was accepted
in others he made a rude reed whistle and at dusk
would tootle for his charmer if she like barkis
was willing she would steal out roped however
squat alongside him and with a blanket wrapped
around them pulled over their heads they would sit
for hours in seeming silence	

   sometimes a dozen flutes would be going atvjnce
but no maiden ever seemed to mistake the wrorog
buck i once heard the squaw of a poor hunter lenj-
ing a buck in front of her husband that she liked him
better than she did her own man and for him to give
her man the amount of her dowry and she would
move to his teepee while all the while her buck sat
with passive face taking it as a matter of course
which it really was

the whites introduced buying of wives but for a
long time the indians thought hey were only
complying with indian customs and were sore when
the whites would go away and leave their squaws
and progeny for the tribe to support

  love in its highest sense appeared to be un-
known the relations were purely sexual and the
whoie thing to the acute observer appeared like a
partnership his duties were to protect obtain
game and skins and to war hers to prepare food
cloth house and bedding from the skins he ob-
tained and to do what slight tillage was done to fur-
nish wood and water-everything in fact that
would leave the buck liberty to perform his duties
and each was proud and jealous of his or her prerog-
atives these being sharply defined both squaws
and bucks despised the whites because the latter did
work pertaining to squaws and therefore seemed to
lose caste as one might say

jhe dog-soldiers were a sort of police at times
under direction of the elders but having a dose
rdation to the medicine-men who also directed them
at times they appeared to be a sort of militant
neophyte if one may use that term and were exe-
cutioners preservers of law and order and had vari-
ous other duties

   the dakotoh being of the algonquin stock origi-
nal habitat new york and pennsylvania driven out
by the iroquois confederacy carried with them
many of the customs of their original locality one
may see the analogy between the dog-soldiers and
the eries cats of the six nations but the eries
were more strictly of the medicine ilk than the dog-
soldiers

  a buck could take a scalp make a coup steal a
horse kill a grizzly and get his feather but to reach
the full rank of brave he must undergo the ordeal
of the sun dance which if he passed satisfactorily
gave him his three feathers marriage the seat in
council and the right to form a band of his own and
be a chief if he could

 a strong high post was planted with thongs
 depending from the top like a may-pole cer-
 tain preliminaries being complied with the medi-

 and a skewer being passed through was attached
 to the thongs the candidate then danccd and
 threw himself backward the object being to tear or
 burst the flesh and muscles and thus free him cut
 the flesh one could not it must be tom by your own
 exertions and if one fainted or succumbed other-

 on thongs were sometimes similarly attached to the
 muscles at the shoulder-blades and the embryo

 the wounds left horrible scars as any old- imer
 can testify rain-in-the-face incurred the
 enmity of the conjurer who slit him and the latter
 ran his knife close to the bone and made a very long
 slit front and back old rain however managed
 in three days to burst the last and gained a wonder-

 also his ability he told tom custer he would take

  this life is dreary and montonous drifting around
day and night in a ninety-foot boat overcast
skies gray-green waves all add to the dreariness at

tion as you can possibly get you grab your old

as to the copy of our magazine that has
had more adventures than any other
copy thats a hard matter on which to
get full data but it is certainly interesting
to record the reports as they come in from

not far from mexico city that was early in

after the war there will be big

the sargasso sea

  question-how large is the sargasso sea just
where is it located is there good foundation for
the stories of fabulous treasure to be found there
has any one successfully navigated this sea or
salvaged treasure from it-thos mahoney a
e f france

  ansiver by captain dingle-your inquiry re-
garding the sargasso sea has been referred to me
and replying i can assure you that all the tales told
of this part of the ocean are as imaginary as any
tale of a trip to the moon or mars actually the
sargasso sea is contained between latitudes  and
 north and longitudes  and about  west
and is simply a vast area of slowly circling waters
formed by the influence of various great ocean
streams

  naturally this slow revolving motion has in the
centuries collected a mass of weed and other float-
ing material sometimes one may see tree-trunks
masts and bits of wreckage but the area is in no
place dense enough to impede navigation unless in
the case of a sailing ship becalmed but a wind
strong enough to move her in clear water will drive
her through the sargasso sea with trifling impedi-
ment of speed in fact as for navigation number-
less lines of ships pass through it every voyage and
if any fabulous wealth lies in that part of the ocean
at all it most certainly lies at the bottom

  you may easily imagine that old-time sailors
with their knack of creating flying dutchmen

phantom ships and other weird things seeing
perhaps a derelict among all the floating weed-
which derelict might easily have been found outside
the weedy area-invented a tale of spanish galleons
eternally revolving in this mysterious maze in mid-
ocean laden with fabulous treasure doomed never
to sink

  finally i will say that while of course the thick-
ness of this weed-strewn sea varies according to the
lately prevailing winds i have passed through it
many many times and have never seen it in such a
condition that a boat could not be rowed through it

diseases of east central africa

  question-i have knocked about considerably
in various countries and it has long been my desire to
visit the dark continent i have roughed it a
great deal am a good shot etc etc

  	what are health conditions aroimd and be-
tween lakes tanganyika and victoria that is is
it a healthy region

  	from an african point of view is it heavily
forested

  	is game more or less abundant there than in
other parts of the interior especially large game
i e of cat and herb-eating species

  	can one live off the country outside medicinal
and other necessities not furnished by nature-
w e c belmore ohio

  answer by mr beadle- health conditions
between lakes tanganyika and victoria are fairly




adventure

bad malaria spirulam black water and sleeping
sickness are the principal diseases in case you
are not familiar with these i will explain briefly
taking it for granted that you know what ma-
laria is

   spirulam is given to man by the bite of a tick and
produces a fever very like malaria but quinin has
no effect it lasts some time and knocks you out
leaving the patient usually very weak but never
have i heard of it being fatal

   black water is violent inflammation of the kidneys
it is a matter of dispute whether black water is the
result of excessive malaria or not resulting in the
urination of blood hence the name very often
fatal as the patient dies of heart failure medicines
are calomel and purge thoroughly stop quinin and
as much champagne and brandy as the patient will
take with the object of keeping up the hearts
jtfction on which everything depends if you get
black water once and get over it my advice is to
clear out of the country

  sleeping sickness is given by the bite of the
tsetse fly rather like a horse-fly with the wings
crossed first produces a slight fever headaches
etc and perhaps vomiting afterward affects the
nervous system with the result that patient becomes
restless irritable and indifferent by turns until
finally he lapses into a coma-deep-attendant with
anemia and a general wasting away there is no
cure yet discovered the percentage of these flies
with the germ in them ready for business is reckoned
to be about two per cent

  but still dont run away with the idea that the
country is fatal ive lived there and the only thing
i collected was malaria and not much of that

  	from a general african point of view it is
fairly wooded that is compared to the congo
forests the forest there is slight and variable
there are uplands with open rolling country and
scrub

  	game large is fairly abundant but varies
greatly stretches without game at all and in
other parts extremely thick-of both sorts

   	no you cannot reckon on living off the coun-
try chickens eggs and sometimes goats and milk
are obtainable at villages by trading-if the natives
happen to be friendly and they usually are if you
know the way to go about it game is too erratic
to rely upon one week you may have enough to
feed a caravan to gorging and the next not enough
for a dog and as for said villages there are large
tracts uninhabited sometimes you can get sweet
potatoes but rarely in my experience and
natures supply of food for man white men partic-
ularly is conspicuous by its absence in most of
africa

outdoor work in maine

  question-i am a young man of seventeen years
of age desirous of getting work on a farm or in a
lumber camp in fact anywhere where i can live and
work in the open i am six feet tall weigh 
pounds and am very strong and healthy if you
can assist me by helping me to get work in your ter-
ritory i will be very grateful to you-alexander
eiser brooklyn n y

  answer by dr hathome-there is plenty of
work to be had on the farms in maine at the present
time and as the season advances help will be very
scarce from all indications there is a great de-
mand for farm help in aroostook county in the

northern part of the state this is a great farming
country and the season of  the farmers raised
over  bushels of potatoes the draft has
taken many of the young men and the farmers will
have to depend on help either over or under the
draft age

  the aroostook chamber of commerce is making
efforts at the present to get volunteers to go there
and work on the farms

  the pay will be good and pleasant homes to live
in if i were you  would write direct to them at
houlton maine and they will write what the wages
will be and other particulars

  there are also many farmers in the vicinity of
bangor that are in need of competent help

     authority on south sea islands

vf r tom l mills writes in a third commun-
 ication  have received from mr a e b
baker a most grateful ask adventurer who is serv-
ing on the china naval station he says

      i have just read a book in strange south
    seas by miss grimshaw it is packed full of
    description and information but how far reli-
    able of course i am not competent to say but
    it sounds to me the right dope all right

  it has occurred to me to make a special note on
this bakerism for the guidance of the many ask
adventurers i have had forty-five queries to answer
up to date miss beatrice gfimshaw is an english
journalist who came out to investigate the south
sea islands they got her she is enamoured of
them-and she now packs on-the-spot facts into
most attractive fiction she makes sydney her
headquarters and no woman has wandered the
south seas to the extent of beatrice grimshaw who
has even dared the interior of papuas the awful
terra incog the late louis becke for south sea
island conditions of twenty years ago and ralph
stock and beatrice grimshaw as modems are good
authorities

grimshaw appeared in advenhire for february 

dog travel in alaska

  question-could you tell me the difference be-
tween eskimo dogs huskies and malamutes

  what form of harness is used what are their
capabilities regarding loads how are they broken
in and at what age would it be possible to secure
a team and have it shipped to me in toronto
what is a good sleigh dog worth

  now i am desirous of taking a trip to alaska and
i would be pleased if you could tell me what lines
of employment would be open to me i have lived
in a city all my life driving horses is my occupa-
tion and i want to get some outdoor work in the
yukon or alaskan country i am twenty years
old-james j doyle toronto canada

  answer by mr solomons-i am glad you are
interested in dog traction it is really quite a fas-
cinating subject

  the terms eskimo dogs huskies and mala-
mutes are used interchangeably by a good many
people the eskimo dog is the native dog of the
arctic and behring sea coasts and may be either a
ask adventure

malamute or a husky the malamute is the
wolf-fox-coyote-outside dog-a combination of
some or all of these though some people deny the
fox ingredient which both the northern indians in
alaska and canada and the eskimos possess

  the name is that of the malamute variously
spelled indians he is a black black and white
brindle or gray or gray and white dog with more or
less small pointed stiff ears and pointed muzzle
he has more or less hair on his toes and in all parts
usually lacking that protection in the ordinary dog of
southern climes the hair is downy or furry dose
to the skin he is a critter of considerable variety
of appearance in other respects than as to these
common features

  the husky on the other hand is a more or less
pure descendant of the timber-wolf and a good speci-
men of hide can not readily be distinguished from
that of a wolf he is larger than the ordinary
indian or eskimo dog in proportion as the latter
differs from him in the amount of wolf strain he
isgray with almost-black long hairs which are more
abundant and longer on the ridge of the back giving
him a much darker color when looked down upon
than in a side view the belly is much lighter
sometimes almost white he is mottled or rather
shaded to some extent and the whole appearance of
the pelt is that of a fur the under side of the neck
like the belly is light gray or whitish the best
specimens came from the mouth of the mackenzie
river

  the natives use the siwash  harness there is a
band round the neck passing between the forelegs
one band rising thence on each side across the ribs
diagonally and coming together at the saddle of the
back where the two are joined by another connect-
ing with the back of the neckband the three bands
are brought together as stated at the back and a
single trace runs back to the sled or joins another
similar trace from the dogs mate at a distance of
several feet and the two united in one go back to
the sled it is a poor arrangement

  the white mans dog harness consists of a collar
made in much the same way as a horse collar and
the two traces are similarly attached at the sides
they are held in place by a back strap with a broader
part above and snapping under the belly there is
no breeching of course the two traces often are
united a few feet back of the dog

  this is in fact the usual plan with light running
equipment but the more careful dogmen and those
who freight loads use a singletree at the back of
the traces this is united to the central draw-rope
by a two or two-and-a-half-foot line sometimes
these use a kind of doubletree which crosses the
draw-rope and is fastened to it in short we drive
dogs much as a team or several teams of horses are
driven and by the use of a good many german
snaps arctic drivers probably call them by some
other name now the harnessing and unharnessing
is quickly done or the position of the pairs of dogs
quickly altered two and two is the usual way
with one leader ahead

  the collars neck collars of the dogs are attached
to the doubletree or lead rope a foot or so ahead by a
light line of suitable length so as to prevent the dogs
from running sideways and getting too far away
from the line the siwash harness is not efficient
and added to the clumsy native sleds makes the

tmlling power of the dog in actual load hauled much
ess than with the white mens teams



  their capabilities regarding loads can only be
expressed of course in terms of comparison with
that of other draft animals and as you are probably
not familiar with reindeer we will speak of horses
either a dog or a horse can of course keep almost
any amount of load moving on glare ice once the
load is started but on a level hard snow trail at
moderate temperatures say zero or a bit wanner
and especially if there is a little sun on the trail a
team of dogs each averaging seventy-five pounds in
weight will keep a load moving all day that weighs
three limes the weight of the dogs this feat
makes him i should say the most wonderful draft
animal we know anything about

  the best i ever got out of horses-and i handled a
hundred picked animals one winter under various
conditions-was about nine tons per six-horse
team on a similar snow trail the horses averaged q
shade under one thousand five hundred pounds
apiece so they drew about twice their own weight
but they couldnt keep it up the way the dogs do

  under less favorable trail conditions and in colder
weather the dogs will average twice their own weight
and under almost any conditions on a broken trail
and day in and day out twelve and fourteen hours a
day up hill and down dale they will lug their own
weight on the arctic we feed them a half a dried
salmon every night and on hard work a bit also at
noon a pound to two and one-half pounds a day
depending on the dryness of the food the size of the
dog the coldness of the weather etc-that is about
the ration a horse packs better than a dog
however

  the natives break in the pups by letting them run
along at first and then tying them to the sled at
first behind then alongside of their mother or father
in the team they soon begin to pull from imita-
tion and from a natural pup-desire to go faster and
see what the next turn of the trail will develop in the
way of interesting or eatable sights

  the team is guided entirely by the leader who lis-
tens for gee and haw mush get-up and
whoa i had a leader that i trained to gee-a-
little it had come to be a nuisance to gee and
have him turn too much to the right and then
haw him back part way a stupid dog will haw
clear back and then some but a sensible one will get
the idea so when i wanted him to veer off a few
points as a sailor would say i added the a little
if i wanted a right angle turn i said gee and if i
wanted to turn clear round i said gee-round

  i have no doubt you could get a dog-tcam from
upper canada it would be too uncertain and ex-
pensive to get a team from the yukon or alaska
a good sleigh dog is usually worth fifty to one
hundred dollars but very fair ones can be bought
for much less it depends on when where and how
the purchase is made in the spring dogs are
naturally cheaper than at the beginning of winter

  of course you can get work in alaska just as
anywhere else and good skinners are usually in
demand if you like the outdoors and are strong
and energetic and used to working with your hands
you will have no trouble in dawson y t or any-
where in the alaskan camps winter freighting
with horses has superseded that with dogs in all the
well-established camps but dogs continue to be the
only means in the smaller and newer districts-or
at least the principal means for there is usually
a stray horse or two wherever a group of men are to
be found
