records as an all-american favorite not

it goes by the handle of buttons
and bows the movie-cowboy song
which won an academy award recently
and which you probably heard sung in
that comedy film the paleface weve

mud and mares
    a year after gold was discovered in california over  per-
sons had passed by ship through the golden gate crews deserted
the moment mudhooks dropped in yerba buena cove over five hundred
deserted vessels rotted at their moorings many sank where they had
anchored
    rooms were at a premium the clipper ship niantic was sunk
close to the mucky shore to form the foundation for the niantic hotel
it became famous overnight
    the cheapest room in san francisco rented for from two to three
hundred dollars a month pay in advance sleeping space on bench or
table fetched from two to ten dollars for an eight-hour sgooze you
furnished the blankets the landlord the lice
    the rainy season of - converted unpaved streets into bog-
holes entire wagons sank from sight horses and mules drowned
so did fools and drunks not to mention women
    since the miners didnt want to lose the latter something was
done brush by the wagonload was dumped into the muck along with
boxes and barrels still crammed with merchandise cases of tobacco
bags of chilean flour and cookstoves still uncrated
    at the corner of clay and kearny in the heart of town a wag
erected a sign
this street is impassable
not even jackassable
    now a century later matters are somewhat improved you can
venture across in safety-provided you own an army tank
    it is well-known that millions of split-hoofs cows went up the
chisholm trail what isnt so familiar to most persons is that hun-
dreds of thousands of solid hoofs horses ajso went to market that
way but not for meat
    when the north west became cow-conscious the ranchers soon
discovered that eastern horses of european stock couldnt begin to
measure up in toughness to the cowponies of the south west of
spanish stock these hardy little animals had been toughened by three
centuries of plains life 
    once the north west ranchers got that through their noggins
a great demand for brood mares of the texas cow pony developed
soon texas cowmen were driving entire herds of horses north along
the chisholm trail these horses almost worthless at home because
of an over supply fetched good prices at dodge city abilene and
ogallala
    about a hundred thousand horses traveled the trail north in 
alone the estimated total that traveled the trail till sodbusters
fences closed it reached close to the million mark

   smashing novel
   of gold-trail war
by tom roan
 
e pukycuojuf paaa
       it wa hotter than the hubs of fury
that late-august afternoon when young
dave mohawk pulled rein on the south
lip of hell dive pass
  behind him the uncertain old gold trail
had led upward from the start an almost
obliterated streak devil-bent on losing it-
self in buck-brush manzanita thickets
scrub-oak and aspen clouding the east
rim of the river that was four days ago
tuesday morning at dawn in scores of
places the rock-walled east bank had been
covered with yards-thick layers of long-
dry mud the bends choked with drift-

 story western magazine
wood matted with vines and creepers
brought down by roaring spring floods
and unpredictable cloudbursts had made
yellow devil canyon one of the most
treacherous and dangerous hell-holes in
the high california sierras
  many men in indian valley-still only
thirty-odd miles behind to southward-
had said that any outfit trying to reopen
yellow devil trail would be tackling the
impossible mohawk had been called a
fool but hell dive pass was at hand two
towering peaks against the sky below
him the river appeared to drop completely
away the narrowing and twisting walls of
the canyon overhanging giant shelves
and ragged crags hiding it making it ap-
pear as a great gushing of white-whipped
water tearing from the mouth of an im-
mense dark cavern
  men with a dozen yokes of powerful
oxen still labored behind him with scrap-
ers plows crow-bars and axes clearing
the last barrier at the foot of an upward
curving shelf the final steep rise to the
top behind those men creeping up as
the trail was cleared was a train of huge
old freighter wagons loaded with tons and
tons of supplies for yellow devil basin
the once-dead and nearly-forgotten old
chinese ghost town that had set the coun-
try afire in the early spring with another
big gold strike that had brought people
pouring in from everywhere
  expecting trail that would yet have to
be cleared on the north slopes he turned
to ride on reaching the level floor of the
pass shelves and ledges in the sides of
the peaks above him the air changed
now a cool wind striking him suddenly
he was pulling up surprise filling his
face under the wide brim of a black hat
right hand dropped close to the butt of a
long colt
ttowdy pardnci the speaker
was an enormously fat red-jowled
man in ill-fitting gray face covered with
a week-old sandy beard his eyes two pale
blue buttons he sat on a nail keg at
the right side of the trail behind  an up-
ended whiskey barrel a six-foot umbrella
of ragged brown canvas over him six-
shooters were at his hips across the top
of the barrel lay two double-barreled
shotguns each a short sawed-down thing
kinda warm aint it the man said
  hot is a better word nodded mo-
hawk wondering what was coming next
hows the trail on down the slope and
into yellow devil basin
  fair shape now all eight miles of it
the man had leaned forward fat hands
resting on a shotgun itll cost a fella
like yuh just a man on a horse only two
dollars too charge flat on the barrel head
to ride on an see for yoreself
  so thats why youre here a thin
smile hardened mohawks lips whos
claiming this as a toll trail
  fan cantello an ranee rubaney
down in yellow devil sitting back the
man slid one of the shotguns from the
barrel head to his lap a quiet move with
a sinister meaning im sam trigg fat
sam some most generally usually call me
cause im kinda portly yuh see i work
for fan an ranee gettin the trail open
agin atter it lyin untouched for years
has cost a lot of money but itll save a
lot of miles an time bein the only direct
way nigh straight into yaller devil basin
cuttin four days at least off of any other
if yuh know what i mean some are
gonna maybe kick no matter the trou-
ble an money fan an ranee has been
put to but thats to be expected i reckon
some people just naturally kick about any-
thing
  and what mohawks eyes had nar-
rowed do you expect to collect for
wagons going over the trail
  from ten to thirty dollars for things
on wheels pardner sam trigg had
something in his huge fat facc that might
have been called a smile big charge is
for freight outfits of course theyre
hard on a trail an them that dont wanta
pay-well they talk to me an this he
lifted the shotgun from his lap into both
hands now fondling the hammers it
packs a two-barrel charge of buckshot
enough lead to cut a fella in half
  an speakin of guns put in an-
other voice between sixty and seventy feet
above sam triggs umbrella we dont
know exact as to whats in your mind
but i wouldnt go reachin for one mr
mohawk
  dave mohawk looked up standing on
the edge of a wide shelf of rock were six
big-hatted men four garbed in buckskins
yellow devil starves tonighti

two in homespun jeans three of them
held double-barreled shotguns the others
long rifles the weapons slanted down-
ward a bearded grin of cocksuredness on
each mans face around their middles
sloped cartridge belts a six-shooter
loosened in its holster at every hip
  we dont aim to start a fuss or a
fight a tall rusty-haired rusty-faced
man in buckskins with a long curving
nose was speaking again just aim to
back fat sam in such as he says or does
plumb law-abidin to the last fella we
are an the laws behind us for all this
that means we dont give a good gaw
damn whether yuh or anybody else is
gonna like it or not we are the law here
would that be right clear to yuh or must
i go over it agin
it was a clear hold-up there was
nothing new about it hold-ups were
everywhere in one form or another from
the lone stage coach bandit staking his
life behind a pair of six-shooters to
crooked lawyers scheming fat-bellied
judges backing them supposed officers
who were nothing more than professional
gunmen sent out with badges on their
chests
 young dave mohawk had heard of
fan cantello and ranee rubaney two
smart wolves always to be found in the
thick of things especially when it came to
new diggings gold and silver rushes any-
where there were dance halls gambling
parlors honky-tonks and people enough
to make it worth while
  gold was where one found it and a
chinese prospector had been the first to
stumble upon it in the deep basin ahead
few were the white men who had
bothered themselves about the basin once
chinamen had given the basin up as
worked-out and useless true to the
chinamans wily way rarely a people to
advertise fortune or misfortune no one
had ever known just how much gold
had been taken out of yellow devil basin
the name white men had givjen it when
they had found their paths blocked the
yellow men firmly making them keep
their distance
  in the spring it had taken one worn-
out ben beck an aged prospector con-
sidered little more than half-witted to
make the big strike the outside worid up
and down california going wild with the
story as soon as it had broken reports
had it that ben beck had already lost
his claim the law moving in shotgun
deputies and six-gun marshals backing
the play and letting other men take oyer
the diggings
  the price can go up but it wont go
down an thats a cinch pardner fat
sam trigg was chuckling now appearing
to enjoy his position of absolute authority
here all the way to the bottom of his huge
belly she goes up just by my sayin
so if a fella gets tough an wants to make
us trouble its best to pay without com-
plaint an save yoreself a hell of a lot
of money i can turn wagons back an
not let em through a-tall the laws
right down clear on that each one of
them fellas above me is a marshal duly
sworn 
  young dave mohawk was sitting
there an object of ridicule and knowing
it these men held all the advantage if
a man tried to fight back anything could
happen to him these men could shoot
him out of his saddle and call it resisting
an arrest and that would be the end of it

reckon fat sam was keeping up that
hellish chuckling big belly quivering yuh
have seventeen extra-big freighters
themll cost yuh exact five hundred an
ten dollars to gt on through them four
lighter wagons-well mr mohawk his
blue button eyes were actually mocking
now lets lump the works at six hun-
dred flat plumb fair aiat it

that trigg mohawk had held himself
as long as he could this  a plain hold-
up the men behind me have opened the
trail nearly all the way to indiau valley

there aint nothin on earth half so dirty
an low unless its men who work for em
an with em like this gang of stinkin
buzzards here
everybody was looking up or try-
ing to look by this time the six
gunmen on the ledge were like frozen
apes with their mouths flapped open only
their heads turned eyes glaring un-
ashamed fear suddenly filling every face
sam trigg seemed to have shrunken on
the keg with a short lurch he had let
the shotgun drop back on the head of the
barrel as if it had suddenly become so
hot his hands could no longer hold it
the blood drained from his huge face as
he now sat with his fat neck twisted try-
ing to look up the umbrella spoiling the
sight for him
  no ghost straight from hell could have
had more effect on men but it was just
one man up there standing on a narrow
spur of rock a perch for an eagle a slip
meaning a plunge to sudden death he
was twenty feet above the men on the
shelf a figure in time-battered and faded
buckskins that were once made for a man
of six feet four a chest on him that might
have belonged to a spanish bull now he
looked older than the hills so gaunt and
hollow-eyed he might have been something
long-buried and just dug up again the
mould of the grave on him the fire of the
damned in those sunken dabs of pale and
dry eyes across the crook of his left arm
was a long rifle at hi hips six-shooters
and a twelve-inch knife that had cut
throats and ripped hearts awinging down
his lean belly in a ragged sheath
  da-mfl-mw gasped the rusty-head
on the ledge voice a dragged-out wheeze
it-its pleasant spurlock
  naw sam trigg half-rolled half-
squashed himself off the nail keg eyes
looking as if they were about to bulge
from their sockets as he stared upward
plez spurlocks dead dead an gone to
hell r
  dead  the ghost on the spur laughed
a hollow sound speaking now in a quar-
relsome monotone ive been dead an
buried so many times ive forgot the
count dead an buried an dug myownself
up to ride to shoot to fight an knife agin
theres eren here to one not countin
the young fella on the hoss whose daddy
some say has been my friend through
thick an thin but nary one of yuh with
guts enough to fight im the meanest

gutless damn swine yuh are git back to
yaller devil basin tell ranee rubaney
an fan cantello yove seen me an im
settin in on their show
  well damn yuh are you deef
     on the ledge they were six to one
the old ghost above them could have been
swept from his narrow perch by a light-
ning swing-around and a sudden blazing
of weapons already in the hands of those
men not yet had he made a move to
touch a six-shooter at either hip the rifle
merely lying across the crook of his lean
old arm the grin of a mocking devil leer-
ing down in a scared outburst of gab-
bling and sputtering fat sam found his
voice again
  dont-uh-dont try to mix it with
im boys he gulped looking as if some-
thing was choking him i-i didnt take
this fool job just to have plez spurlock
kill me stoppin the first wagon outfit to
come along dont rile im if-if he
blows loose an kills one liell kill the
whole damn works fore he quits shoot-
in
  in leas than a minute the shot-gun hold-
up that had been so comfortably lodged
here at the side of the trail had become
a thing of the past the whiskey barrel
the keg and umbrella had gone off over
the nearest lip of rock overhanging the
canyon on the north side of the pass then
down and down into bouncing and shat-
tering bits scattering all the way to the
river and into it with a wild snatch-off
of his hat fat sam trigg was gone also
around a bend and down the trail toward
yellow devil basin as if turned to a
bouncing barrel himself on two short kgs
yellow devil starves tonight

  there was no fight in the men on the
ledge fat sam was their boss up here
and they had seen how he had taken it
six-shooters shotguns and rifles had been
carefully lowered to the ledge men pale
as they lifted their hands mean old eyes
above watching every move a hellish leer
mocking them in a line they turned
moving away slowly as if a quick move
even now might start them falling dead
in their tracks before they had gone
far their pace was quickening soon their
steps were becoming long strides then a
wild run every man snatching off his hat
a shoulder of rocks hid them as they
scurried on heading for horses waiting
for them somewhere down the ledges
  thanks to pleasant spurlock dave
mohawks big hat came off with a swing
as he turned in his saddle looking up
trying to see an old scarecrow figure who
had suddenly vanished i-i-
	he ghost of the spur was gone
just as he had come like something
suddenly taking shape out of the thin air
like something suddenly vanishing back
into it murdock called up several times
to where he had stood but there was no
answer the only sound in any direction
for more than a minute was the distant
beat of hoofs somewhere down the ledge
that faint drumming dying away into the
basin then yokes creaked in the other
direction and murdock swung toward the
sounds the brass-tipped horns on the
heads of oxen beginning to rise from the
south slopes of hell dive pass his long-
delayed outfit coming up at last once
over the high hump here the rest would
be down grade
  he had to be careful with anything he
said now counting all hands there were
twenty one drivers seven freight-buckers
and one all-around troubleshooter in the
outfit only a few of them would be real
fighting men used to guns and knives
being pitted against them without waver-
ing
  all of them would lift a brow when he
told them that old pier spurlock had ap-

he wa ten and he had heard of this wild
man of the hills and valleys since the day
he had landed in california many men
thought of him as nothing less than a
devil an outlaw and a terrorist
  like most noted frontiersmen plez
spurlock was supposed to have been
everywhere and done everything he had
been rich a dozen times gambler trader
scout captain of wagon trains crawling
over the california the spanish the mor-
mon and the oregon trails in rousing
gold camps he had been rated as king of
the bonanza many times rich one day and
poor the next envied hated cursed and
damned yet a man with friends who
would still swear by him
  an hour ago the link-up of plez spur-
locks name would not have been a good
one with that of a man just starting an
extra tough freight hauling contract in
these high hills and dark canyons after
the attempted hold-up here one could ex-
pect anything more and more troubles
facing him and even satans name might
be a welcome one to receive before this
long job was running smoothly loads of
supplies going into yellow devil basin
tons of gold ore coming out in twice-
weekly stream
  whistling pete ford a one-eyed hare-
lipped giant red-head was the man to talk
to and let him pass the story back through
the train in his own way ford had been
trouble-shooter and the riding wagon boss
since the start going up and down the
line to keep things in trim getting the
big freighters to rolling as soon as the
slid were cleared ahead he suddenly
appeared now spurring up and galloping
around the first wagon on a tall sweaty
bay
  first four wagons turn out here for
camp i he swung to his right waving
toward a small flat let the others keep
aclimin as long as yove got em rollin
  mohawk spurred in beside him taking
only a minute to briefly outline what had
happened the giant listening intently
good right eye narrowing to a golden but-
ton the black square of felt over the
socket of his left appearing to tighten
on the rawhide string around his head
he swore a couple of times in a whisper
face harder than rock
spmxxk aint a bird id like to
have in my string dave he frowned
hare lip making a little whistly flutter
but id yonder feel safer if he was on
my side instead of agin me
  only one thing im glad about he
grinned now i never had any trouble
with plez spurlock the few times i saw
itn i think he sorter liked me an i know
yore daddy was his friend he wont for-
get never well just go on through
if he said the trail was clear then shes
clear plez wont lie to yuh
mohawk was leading the way on
for the big freighters a short time
later for two hours they were going
down a great twisting shelf that was like
the wide brim of an enormous hat in the
face of the cliffs dangerous rocks hung
overhead in scores of places troughs here
and there where roaring slides could come
down there was no evidence of any
work having been on the trail for years
but it was clear enough downhill now
the long yokes of cattle could walk with
slacked chains only the wheel-yoke
having to swing the tongues here and
there at the bends bullwhackers on the
high seats were constantly applying their
brakes until they struck a round flat
mottled with fantastic knolls that was the
floor of the basin itself
  whistling pete ford came galloping
up now a grin on his face the good eye
sparkling with satisfaction
  theres yore town ahead of us dave
yuh can bet were bein watched right
now-an some things not nice his grin
widened is being said about us
  bending westward the sun gone be-
hind the mountains ahead of them they
had come up a smooth slight rise between
a pair of those queer-shaped knolls that
somehow reminded one of a great sullen
buddha sitting at either side of the trail
all around them now loomed cliffs and
crags forming a monstrous hole six or
seven thousand feet deep here in the sky-
high reach of the mountains the floor of
it no more than three miles across at the
widest place
  the river was ahead of them so flat
and shallow here it was more than eighty
yards across the water unwhipped and
clear as it whispered over a bed of almost
perfectly smooth rock beyond it waa
yellow devil starves tonight
zi
the town from the distance of yet a
mile away it might have been something
plucked from the heart of old qiina and
dropped here in the middle of the tower-
ing california-sierras
  as far as the old part of the town every
mud and stone house was standing just
as the yellow men had left it the streets
narrow and floored with natural rock it
filled a near-round little pocket there in
the foot of the cliffs at the west side of
the basin two outward-curving walls of
rock and mud guarding it a tiny veil-
like waterfall shimmering down at the far
end of it outside the wall now were
new houses shacks tents a few covered
wagons and carts the old town turned
into gambling dives saloons honky-tonks
and stores at every hand outside were
new diggings fresh earth brought to the
top of the ground scores of men and even
women laboring with rockers or standing
barefooted in the water panning for gold
up and down the river
  an yonder aready comes a greeter
party whistling pete ford nodded to-
ward the break under a high log beam
in the wall of the old town wont be
long now before our ears start burnin
with what theyll have to say about us
  mohawk merely nodded in turn blue
eyes studying six horsemen galloping to-
ward them recognizing them even from
the distance as the men who had been so
cocksure of themselves on the high ledge
back in ilell dive pass back here in
the shadows of their masters they would
probably be better fighting dogs each
man carried a shining-new double bar-
reled shotgun across his lap new cartridge
belts around him the unblemished butts
of six-shooters gleaming at every hip in
addition as if to be more awe-inspiring
with authority each man wore a glitter-
ing brand-new marshals star pinned to
the left side of his shirt

tling pete as they stopped to let their
horses drink in the middle of the river
try to center ever ball on one of them
little tin badges an blow it through a
dirty heart 
  the gunmen had come to the other side
of the stream pulling up in a little cloud
of dust two were spurring their horses
to the right two to the left the other
pair pulled in the center of the trail a
somewhat nervous but evil leer on each
face as mohawk and whistling pete
quietly rode on and up the slight rise
the rusty-looking red-head spoke
  yuh asked for trouble mohawk yuh
get it damn it the laws the law
the law dave mohawk rode
straight on to him and pulled up on the
mans right with the toes of their stirrups
a short yard apart who in hell ever
said there was any law in yellow devil
basin but fan cantello and ranee ru-
baney 
  no matter who says it or dont weve
got it snarled back the red-head rules
everbody has to go by whether they like
em or not naturally theres got to be

  mohawk cut him off lifting his left
hand we wont go into that were
here with tons of supplies to cut the high-
way robbery price of flour down from a
dollar a pound-
  yuh aint here to cut nothin ripped
back the red-head yuh got this train

yuh that youll never get a wagon in yore
outfit back to indian valley yove got
to go see fan an ranee an-uht
unable to stand that snarling lip any
longer dave mohawk had jabbed a spur
to his horse lunging him forward right
fist coming up and in like a maul on a
swinging handle a furious blow drove
straight to the red-heads mouth and nose
the red-head rocked back in his saddle
feet flying up spilling heavily to the
ground before the man on the left could
get out of the way a lightning hand had
caught him by the shoulder snatching
him out of his saddle and hurling that
surprised bully down atop the dazed red-
head
  he starts fast when he starts yelled
whistling pete a pair of cocked six-
shooters filling his hands mean good eye
flashing right and left lets go law

go reach for yore hardware an then

bare-footed bare-legged old man who
had been panning for gold in the river a
few minutes ago there aint no damned
law in this forgotten hell-cussed chink
hole no law cept fan cantello an
ranee rubaney
  peaceful-iooking people who had been
working up and down the river had sud-
denly dropped everything and were press-
ing forward six-shooters old pistols or
knives hung at the hips of the men
women were following them with shovels
picks or knotty clubs of driftwood one
gaunt missouri woman carried a round
rock as large as her fist in each hand
sudden war in her pale eyes she started
screeching her voice as mean and bitter
as the squawking of a fighting magpie
  i heard what this young feller said
bout dollar a pound flour he didnt say
two dollars a pound for cheap brown sugar
as hard as a rock an filled with sand an
aswarmin with ants he didnt say three

pressed against the animals shoulders

show it i say reach-an die an go to
hell with them little tin badges on yuh

waitin 
ohawk had dropped from his
saddle and was standing there over
the two men on the ground up as far
as his elbow the red-head rolled under
his horses belly with a sudden twisting
and squirming and came up on the other
side leaving his hat behind he got into
the saddle raking with both spurs and
wildly flapping his reins he was suddenly
wheeling away leaving the others to take
care of themselves
  take out with him mohawk kicked
with all his weight and strength as he
yelled the order the man who had been
merely snatched from his horse was up
to his hands and knees looking addled
not knowing what to do the toe o
mohawks boot decided him it caughl
him with the stab of the sharp end of a
pole from straight behind the hellishly
painful drive lifting him scooting him for-
ward on his nose and face get back to
fan and ranee tell them our wagons
are coming right on in
  not bothering with his horse having
had more than enough of this business
right now the kicked man lurched to his
feet yelling in pain fear and anger one
hand plopped and clamped behind him
he took off like a limping bird on the
wing his horse turning to snort and stare
at him until mohawk gave him a slap
across the rump the ganging up crowd
yelling and laughing watching that limp-
ing gunman go the horse trotting along
behind him
  yuli see em whistling pete was
raging again at the other four gunmen
who seemed too addled to do anything
but sit there in their saddles staring all
the bristle taken out of them get goin
behind em-an keep right on goin
through them mountains ahead of yuh
when yuh come to em if yuh make a
hole pull it in behind yuh
  flour folks is acomin down he
was suddenly out of his saddle and bellow-
ing at the crowd as the four remaining
gunmen wheeled their horses faces like
chalk as they headed back for the gate in
the old wall-anything to get out of this
mess in a hurry coffee sugar ever-
thing yuh want at prices no highern san
francisco-or by gawd dave mohawk
will quit haulin i know whats in his
contract i know what kind of a fella
dave is or i sure as hell wouldnt be here
with im
  but the crowd had heard enough
everybody was cheering out and out
revolt was here people now ready to
fight mobs were crowding around them
slapping them on their backs others
were ganging along the river bank some
wading out in the stream to cheer the
builwhackers as the long line of huge old
wagons started lumbering across their
canvas tops swaying drivers grinning on
their seals like bearded monks
  being a cold realist fan cantello had
never expected the best knowing the
yellow devil starves tonight

big wagons would come on in he had
wailed leaving it up to ranee rubaney
to give the order to pass out the new
guns and shiny badges
  a figure always in gray thin-faced and
thin-bearded he was now standing at an
upstairs window in one of the largest
groups of the old houses on the south
side of the street four of them so close
together they had been covered with one
huge roof he had seen the trouble in
the distance had seen rusty medberry
get knocked off his horse the dark seth
cantler yanked off medberry was now
hammering it back to town cantler soon
following afoot-hot-footing it as if the
devil was after him
  there was nothing to the other four
yokels kent mall ira delano punch
ritter and paul clark he had known
it all along given the supposed proper
authority and armed to the teeth they
could roar and bully pushing the more
timid around and kicking them in their
places making them stand and cower too
afraid to strike back it was something
else when it came to sending them out to
face real fighting men who would fly loose
and come up gunning or knifing with all
the odds in the world against them like
fat sam trigg-that big barrel of lard
and guts-they would wilt turn tail and
suddenly find themselves running for it
  a little better had been expected of
rusty medberry and seth cantler both
had been prison guards back in a missis-
sippi penitentiary and should have learned
something about handling men
  big dark and barrel-chested ranee
rubaney was handling the show this time
and fan cantello was keeping to the
background an agreement they had come
to after landing here among the first in
the rush there had been trouble in
several places behind them the last one
only as far away as grub gulch down in
ahwahnee valley where ranee took the
greater share of handling the bar the
gambling tables and the dance floors fan
cantello himself had taken over the rest
of it later he had caught the blame for
the blow-up they had had just time
and the foresight to escape by a quick
sell-out for half the worth of their hold-
ings and a sudden leave-taking forty hours
before wholesale revolt had struck the
valley they had barely kept their lives
  not exactly resenting something of a
little temporary set-back here unable to
swallow all ego and a feeling of i-told-
you-so because he had caught so much
hell over the business in grub gulch
cantello turned and walked back down-
stairs now
rance rubaney was not worried
cantello saw that when he came to
the foot of the stairs in the huge bar room
and saw him sitting at a table in the cor-
ner with a big ledger open in front of
him a pen-quill and a bottle of ink beside
it at the bar was a good line-up twenty-
odd men and half as many of the per-
centage women and girls already at work
urging the men to buy drinks using their
prettiest smiles winks and whispered
sweetness as come-alongs
  here were fighting men all that would
be needed at the bar were buckskinned
rough-necks well-armed yokels in home-
spun jeans bullwhackers and pack-train
rowdies who had been bringing in all sup-
plies by mule and horse or two-wheeled
bull-carts over the dangerous trails at their
own prices the tale of the opening of
the old yellow devil train over hell
dive pass had already gone the rounds
it pleased none of these high-priced men
to know that huge freighters were coming
in
  dog eat dog is the way of life a
dark smile flashed over ranee rubaneys
face when cantello dropped into a chair
beside him a man close to fifty fond of
doeskin trousers high beavers and cut-
away black coats thats how we got
our start and how well keep it
   then a mirthless little smile rippled
back at him youve seen your fine mar-
shals come bustling back to town
  i hear all and see nothing fan
kubaneys face darkened for an instant
im not quite fumbly and crudc enough
to have them come rushing in to me and
everybody staring at them our supposed-
ly honorable and able judge fetzer tal-
butt is the man they run to i merely
pass along the word what he is to say
and do
  that fat tub of tobacco-rusted whis-
kers and guts is no better than fat sam
when you look for brains 
i	 story western magazine
  like fat sam he at least will try to
carry out orders ranee rubaney was
smiling again a man too smart wouldnt
stand in his boots to take the blame for
everything that happens this is not grub
gulch fan they can point their fingers
at us here and say were behind it all
but theres still the little matter of proof
damned little needed half-sneered
cantello when the people know a thing
in their own minds and set out to get you
you know what i mean weve had to
leave some towns a damned sight faster
than we left grub gulch
  we had an election here shortly after
we came it seemed that rubaney was
not going to let his temper be riled a
tin-pan parade up and down the street
fiddles wailing banjoes ringing and guitars
strumming women singing and dancing
fetzer talbutt and fat sam bowing and
wheezing talbutt even shedding a few
crocodile tears on an up-ended whiskey
barrel just like you took the front in
grub gulch here neither you nor i took
part in it
  and now nodded cantello coldly
at the first little set-back we curl our
tails between our legs and go lie with
our pups
  nothing of the kind ranee rubaney
laughed at him now a fair check says
we have between six and seven hundred
people here it wont be nice to have to
face the most of them in sudden revolt
we leave all that to fat sam trigg and
the right honorable judge fetzer talbutt
young dave mohawk came through with
freight this time but hell never bring
another wagon and never another
damned pound over hell dive pass
thats fixed
  everybody knows we run this town
you cant laugh that off
  im king of the show this time not
you
  even with the tale of plez spurlock
showing up
  are you fool enough to believe that
anger flashed now in ranee rubaneys
eyes plez spurlocks dead and gone to
hell the story was in every paper pub-
lished in california
  a vast upheaval of cheering from the
street seemed to answer him the noise
of wagon wheels grinding yokes creak-
ing the slow but infernally steady sounds
of oxen hoofs on the rocky ground dave
mohawk and whistling pete ford were
stringing into town mobs of people from
the river tagging along beside the huge
old wagons others piling out to join them
  grub at san francisco prices yelled
a voice no more dollar a damn pound
for flour
  no more three dollar a pound damn
coffee shrilled an old womans voice
no more two dollar brown sugar filled
with phizzants

     two big hairy-chested men of
fifty-odd in buckskins were now leading
the way one was the six-foot yard-
wide red-headed and red-bearded buck-
shot bill driver the other was the
equally big black-bearded rip chandler
the two were trappers traders and indian
scouts from the montana and dakota ter-
ritories-men who had seen a damned
sight worse places than this and had
pulled through with the hair still on their
heads and fighting blood in their veins
the only kind who would have dared to
open a general store without first making
a deal with the so-called law of the town
  it must have been a surprise to almost
everybody when driver and chandler
swung to their right and led the wagons
into a horseshoe-like curve on the north
side of the street here was the oldest
and worst part of the town six or seven
stone-faced houses that were little more
than ancient cliff dwellings jammed under
a great overhang of rocks half the roofs
caved in hand-split doors down or miss-
ing windows broken holes they were
places nobody had wanted
  at the beginning it looked as if it would
go through without more trouble for the
rest of the day unloading the wagons
was a task that could have taken hours
but free help was suddenly surging for-
ward in a few minutes it was like bees
swarming and working before a storm
more and more men kept pouring up
ripping off their coats vests or shirts to
pitch in and help women girls and mere
youths grabbed smaller boxes bales kegs
and bundles laughing as they hurried
yellow devil starves tonight

them inside the old ramshackle houses
  rut as always in such things another
side of it had gathered sullen-faced men
kept ganging up and crowding into a
menacing half-circle on the outer rim of
the humming activity whispering growl-
ing and nodding started a drunk or half-
drunk here and there blurting out some
uncertain threat seeing that they were
being ignored they grew bolder several
men started slapping a big bull-chested
black-bearded giant on the back a drunk

like fists a few pretending hands reached
out as if to stop him they were only
urging himon intended for nothing else
trouble-makers knowing how to start their
bull

white froth beginning to form in bubbles
at the corners of his wide mouth a bully
believing he was about to make himself
a hero in the eyes of his gang

cause here i am take me as i come
but i warn yuh if yuh drop yoll never
get up
it was all hell fury with the quickness
of a shotguns blast the two giants
came together bull smith looking for
just an instant as if he wished he had
never been rodded into starting this thing
of blood a roar from the crowd behind
drove him on-a head-lowered rumbling
charging bull driving straight for big
petes mid-section unable to turn back
after going this far
  nothing was going to hold ford his
right fist swung like a sledge on the end
of a handle it caught the charging human
bull somewhere about the head a blow
to addle an ox turning his charge stum-
bling him and sending him face-diving
to the ground
  i said dont go down roared ford
i give what yore kind an yore gangs
alius give when they get a man in a
fix like that stay on yore feet or die
i give no quarter an by gawd i ask
none
  it was the nearest thing to murder a
man could come to pete ford was a big
man with a wild yell and a wilder leap
he went up in the air feet drawing up
he came down in the middle of smiths
back heels driving with all his weight
and fury flattening him out bringing a
groan from all around then suddenly
stooping still kicking blood flying mov-
ing faster than a fighting bee he had
smith by the slack of the pants and the
back of his collar swinging him straight
above his head with the strength of
an insane giant he sent smith flying
straight into the buck-tooth knocking
him down then he was upon both of
them kicking smashing driving the
buck-tooth letting out just one wail of
terror before a grinding heel found his
mouth
  with the crowd who had urged smith
into it now falling back there was only
one thing to do dave mohawk did it
and saved two men from being stomped
into bloody lifeless shapes there on the
ground in front of every horrified eye
mohawk rushed in he caught ford
from the big mans right getting a firm
grip in th stout buckskin sleeve of the
upper arm a fierce swing brought him
around a lightning fist driving true to
its mark landing just below fords righl
ear with a sickening smack whistling
pete ford went down addled like an os
under a butchers maul he came up in
a daze wheeling sawing out his hands
and powerful arms to tangle with mohawk
now before he could get set mohawk
had caught him on the point of the chin
this time a clean knockout that sent the
ruthless fighting man sprawling backward
on the ground
  and the next time mohawk was
turning on the fight-starters now ill
let him go and throw every man ive got
into it get out of here every damned
one of you get going take these two
hunks of bloody meat with you
ujvfob us would ye it was not
   --a over even with the trouble-makers
falling back like scared curs with their
tails between their legs each man with
the sole thought of finding a safe dive or
hole somewhere the rawboned missouri
woman had grabbed a rock in each hand
and was swinging back one leg up and
suddenly letting fly only in dirty gangs
can yer kind ever fight ye low-born filthy-
necked an stinkin rat brains whon
hell told ye varmits ye could starve us
to death
   it was too late for anyone to hold the
woman the first rock was gone as true
as a baseball pitcher driving one squarely
over the home plate a running man in
the would-be tough gang was suddenly
catching it on the back of the head the
plop the sound of a ball on a bat buck-
ling forward at the belly from the knees
to the shoulders shaping like a felloe out
of a wagon wheel he went down he
hit on his belly arched over his chin
striking the hard ground like a hammer
  now maw now maw yelled a
lean old missourian ye dast not take
things too far in yer own hands
  plop maw had let fly with the second
rock it was almost a miss but it struck
so close to its mark it seemed to tear a
running mans right ear half-off and send
it flapping forward bringing a squirt of
red and a yell of pain
  dave mohawk had pinned the hare-
lipped whistling pete fords big arms
yellow devil starves tonight

behind his back and was sitting astride
of him gripping him tightly between his
knees ford was coming out of it begin-
ning to squirm big legs and feet kicking
a man still dangerous still apt to get up
and do terrible things mohawk swore
at him
  take it easy damn it pete he
tightened the big arms upward pinching
him with his knees going to hold him or
crush his ribs its all over now-and
theyre not coming back
  but-but they will come back
snarled and gasped ford when he could
et his breath in great gulping and snort-
ing sounds rats like em always will as
long as theres some dirtier rat around to
back their play with the law let me up
dave gawdamnit youve just about
busted my jaw
  you can get up if youll behave your-
self pete mohawk gave his arms an-
other painful push up nis back i dont
want to hurt you but youre not running
everything here youre dragging in your
bloody fighting horns and listening to
me i
  didnt aim to fly off so hell-sudden
dave ford was half-apologetic maybe
ive seen too many of these kw-browed
bull-necked things in these towns half
the time their slimy wimmin out with em
screamin their dirty lungs out id kill
one of them as quick as id kill a man an
stomp her teeth an face down her throat
shes just as low-gutted just as rotten

  all right pete all right mohawk
was finally shutting him up gradually re-
leasing his fierce holds on him a still
trembling still dangerous man weve
ot work here to do and therell be fight-
ing ahead of u-dirty fighting
he had him back to work a few
minutes later but he was watching
him ford was now a man getting rid
of some of his blaring fury on the heavy
bales and boxes pawing them out of the
ends of wagons and carrying them inside
the old houses many of them so heavy
three or four men should have tackled
the job muttering ire still holding he
was working like a beaat in a frenzy when
the last wagon was unloaded
  buckshot bill driver camc up now
grinning through his big red bird and
spitting tobacco juice
  well handle the rest of er dave
he glanced around one of the hackling
trouble-making mob left theres enough
people here to tear the town apart if they
start on us folks have to eat an by
gawd were goin to feed em at decent
prices an damn the would-be law bein
on the other side an square agin us yuh

an its right where theyre gonna try to
get even with yuh they aint quit hell
they aint yet started to fight yuh gangs
like this are the same the world over-
gutless sneaky willin to do anything if
its cowardly and dirty
  the wagons were rolling out and back
down the street a short time later swing-
ing on back to the east bank of the river
darkness was pooling around them when
they started going into camp but they
were far from being alone here camp
fires of the gold-seekers burned up and
down the river gangs of people keeping
in bunches and strings for mutual protec-
tion were coming back with loads of sup-
plies hastily doled out by buckshot bill
driver and rip chandler everybody hap-
py now that prices of the necessities of life
itself had suddenly been brought down to
where the common people could buy them
but after supper even with people they
could trust all around them it was like a
wagon camp in hostile indian country
alert men standing guard over the freight-
ers and cattle like sentries around a battle-
camp
  before dawn they were stirring morn-
ing fires springing into being up and down
the banks of the river people chewed
them at sunrise as the train going out
empty this time came out of it drde and
headed eastward across the basin tall out-
bound wagons over the dangerous trail
for indian valtar and another great load
of supplies and food for the hard-premed
miners
  despite the cheers many people stared
at these long-swaying canvas tops and
stringed yokes of cattle as far as they
coula see them among the queer-shaped
knolls many men and women were con-
vinced beyond any hint of doubt that they
were watching them roll awav to certain

thoughtful whistling pete mohawk was
alert at every bend and danger spot all
the way to the top of hell dive pass but
the trail was just as they had left it yester-
day at the camp up there not a thing
had happened no one passing up or down
the trail in either direction
  it was something else when they struck
the river it seemed that everybody had
heard that the trail had been opened
more and more gold-hunters were pour-
ing into indian valley-men on horse-
back lines of pack-mules carts light
wagons and buggies one string after an-
other the big freight outfit having a
tedious time in places to pass them or let
them pass
  at sunset when they camped for the
night on a big flat far down the river
people were still stringing north one gang
hustling to get ahead of another every-
body bug-eyed to get to yellow devil
basin
  gold growled whistling pete over
his coffee all yuh gotta do is tell em
where somebodys hit it an all hell pours
out
  it was worse in indian valley when
they rolled in next morning just before
noon every vacant lot was filled the
main street milling with people the three
big stores of the town looked as if they
had been looted the most of their shelves
empty their long counters bare more
people reported coming and hurried calls
sent down the valley for extra supplies
  - having a warehouse of his own to draw
from mohawk rested the cattle until the
following dawn meanwhile rounding up
ten more big wagons and the freighters
were rolling out people wagons buggies
pack-trains and carts were ahead of them
others stringing in behind everybody
quivering and chattering with excitement
  damndest turn-out since the wimmin
come in fifty one grinned whistling
pete yaller devils gonna be runnin
over with em  well be runnin hundred-
wagon hauls if this keeps up
  with everything going north nothing
coming south it was almost clear rolling
now and then the breakdown of an over-
loaded cart or rattle-trap wagon held
them up but it only gave the oxen a
chance to rest while the fall-apart ahead
could be dragged off to the side of the
trail gold-seekers behind it cursing and
yowling pitching in to help get the wreck-
age out of their way
  when nightfall struck them mohawks
outfit went into camp some of the gold-
seekers camped above him or below him
others feverishly pushing on in the dark-
ness greed unable to hold them when
morning came night behind them and an-
other full day in front of them the late
afternoon found the freighters nearing
the long drag-up where men and yokes
from the camp on hell dive pass were
waiting to help them over it was here
with half the men and cattle from the pass
camp trying to squeeze down to the
freighters that the damnation broke loose
ahead
  without any warning whatever a roar
shook the mountains the thunder of it
reverberating down the canyon from end
to end aheels of it came a tumbling
tossing and tremendous splashing sound
ahead as if the high crags and ledges were
falling into the river
  distant yells from suddenly popeyed
men screams and wails from women and
children joined the noise into that were
bawls from panic-stricken cattle mules
setting up a wild and trumpet-like bray-
ing into all of that was suddenly in-
jected a lasting outburst of gunfire more
men in the distance cursing and yelling
then over that rode another tremendous
explosion a roar that shook the moun-
tains and started loose pieces of rock fall-
ing as far as a thousand yards away from
it the canyon trembling again as if an
earthquake ran up and down the river
  mohawk and whistling pete managed
to get their horses to the top having to
crowd and fight their ways through and
past the swarming hordes of terrorized
humanity sawing and lunging animals
stalled carts and wagons they found
only one excited youth at the camp a boy
of seventeen armed with two big six-
shooters and a rifle
  theyve hit dave theyve hit he
yelled an old man who called imself
plez spurlock showed up in camp way
fore daylight this mornin he snaked
yellow devil starves tonight

half the fellas away with im somebodys
tryin to blow the pass clear from under
us an stop them freighters from acomin
in with the cheap grub take to the tops
above the trail an maybe yoll find old
plez an the fellas
spurring on another wild let-loose
of shots leading them they went up
a mere wild-goat trail in the rocks above
the east side of the pass reaching the
dangerous top shots dying away ahead
mohawk saw men from the camp in the
rocks all of them with leveled rifles in-
tently watclfing something coming up in
front of them as he pulled up the lean
ghost that was old plez spurlock appeared
behind him trailed three men with their
hands in the air one of them was fat
sam trigg the other the red-headed
rusty-faced man who had tried to back
his play on the ledge the last was bull
smith face still a mass of court plaster
and blue-black knots from whistling
petes terrible grizzly bear mauling
  putting his back to them looked like
a hell of a way for a man to handle prison-
ers until mohawk saw the red-headed
red-bearded buckshot bill driver bringing
up the rear a rifle across his arm six-
shooters in his belt and a long knife swing-
ing against his bosom
  theres leastwise eight more down
there sommers where they lodged in the
rocks growled spurlock unless some
two or three got away atter bein hit we
saved these three to have em tell us an
the rest of the people all about it theyll
talk good especially fat sam they was
gonna blow the trail down right in front
of yuh dave all these goldhunters pour-
in in sorter held em back i trailed em
last night while they was settin dynamite

the wires runnin to em to where theyd
only roar without real damage to the trail

butts judge he-he says he is fan an

and took a firm grip in his collar pulling
him up to look keenly into his eyes if

all the grease an muck id ram my fist
through that fat-frog face an push it clear
out the back well see fan an ranee

  other people were coming by this time
gold-seekers who thought they had barely
escaped with their lives soon the rocks
were filled with them muttering snarling
men already beginning to talk about rope-
law right here on the pass

gold-seekers guarding them from the
mobs
  even with clouds of gold-seekers drop-
ping work in all directions to follow them
a tense quiet seemed to hold everything
when they pulled up in front of the joy-
land mohawk led the way inside at
least thirty well-armed men stood at the
bar appearing glued to the hand-rail
  the rest of the room was empty mo-
hawk spoke i see that fan cantello
and ranee rubaney run true to form
when danger comes theyre not the men
to face it they leave others behind to
light and die for them
  no one answered him but he saw a
head jerk here and there men quickly
looking at each other out of the corners of
their eyes he went on watching the
foot of a dark stairway in the corner
  mobs are forming outside the kind
fan and ranee use-when they can get
other numbskulls like you to lead them
the only thing to save you from stretch-
ing rope in this is to keep standing right
there at the bar where are they
again no one answered him but he
saw two of the bartenders nervously turn
their eyes toward the dark stairway with
gold-hunters crowding in behind the
ghost-like plez spurlock and whistling
pete ford there was no more waiting
thumbs on the buckles of his belts mo-
hawk walked on ford followed him
old plez spurlock stood where he had
stopped a six-shooter coming into each
hand gnarled thumbs cocking them

need this damn crowd behind me to handle

por a third time no one at the
bar spoke all of them must have
glanced at him they must have seen the
-teadily growing crowd out front and
heard the growing mumble of voices but
the
everybody seemed to be listening now to
the footsteps of mohawk and ford on
the stairs it must have reminded them
of low hammer blows on a coffin lid
somebody was going to die that was
a certainty for up those stairs men were
waiting men who could not see he mobs
hastily forming in the street suddenly
the entire upper part of the jmdand
seemed to shake with a flash of gunfire
   mohawk and ford had suddenly drop-
ped just their heads and hands showing
above the top of the stairs gunfire on the
level of the floor jerking answering shots
that came from where a door had been
yanked open straight ahead of them
chairs crashed a table upsetting oaths
snarling then a furious burst of yells
a window being shattered to bits came
into it glass falling in a rain to the rocky
ground behind the joyland
   damn em theyre runnin for it

moved on finding only two men waiting

hands stretched above their heads
  out and down the stairs mohawk
wiggled his six-shooters at them you
wont be alone long before we crossed
the river plez spurlock thought of those
three taking a back way dive-out i think
theres a crowd down there to take them
   fifty men had them when he marched
these two scared gunmen back down the
stairs leaving the three dead men where
they had dropped on the floor cantello

talbutt had been caught in mid-air one
after the other as they came dropping
from the shattered window now they
were being booted shoved and rough-

trouble rides
from texas
by charles w
tyler
cimarrona bullet dammed inf
the younger tracey and turned
him against the hitchrail
davy mather got little welcome from
kis brothers-for only the guns of the
cimarron kid could help them now
davy mather was seventeen
when he left pineville a scrawny
peaked-faced kid with blue eyes
and an impish grin he was older now
five years as time is countcd a thousand
years older in wiseness there was ice in
the blue eyes and the grin was lost some-
where under that taut layer of weathered
hide
there had been a lot of rivers to cross
and those crossings had made him hard
gun-wise there had been hays and bax-
ter springs and dodge on those long cat-
tle trails north and ogallala and milea
city there had been saloons and honk-
atonks and gambling houses for a kid to
learn about and trail wolves and toughs


 story western magazine
and drunken texas men settine their
guns aflame
  in those years pineville had seemed a
long way off a lot of times he had wished
he was back in this sleepv town nestling
under the gray crags of the saddlehorn
funny how a kid took fiddle-footed no-
tions kinda figgered hed make plenty
money an come back some day with a
fancy saddle a twenty-dollar stetson an
a lot of shine to him talkin big of the
places hed been
  davy mather reined in where the road
bent around the hill looking down on the
town approaching the bridge his ears
caught the sing-song chant of the black-
smiths hammer a cheery friendly sound
shod hoofs striking the planking turned
attention his way and the loungers there
eyed the rider mildly curious
  riding on toward the livery barn davy
saw familiar faces but no one recognized
the dusty horseman with his texas rig
he stabled his pony and went toward
fred hardys barber shop conscious of
his trail grime and unkemptness
  fred hardy stared at the lean figure
pushing through the door then he said
slowly well dog mv cats say when
we hoe ye oui from behind them whiskers
i bet seven dollars ye turn out to be davy
mather he wrung davys hand
  hows things in pineville davy
said
  just like always fred hardys glance
dropped to the worn gun-belt the hol-
stered six-shooter where ye been keep-
in yourself all these years boy
   punchin cattle back on the big trails
  ye-dont tell
  it was good to soak in the old tin-lined
tub in back of the barber shop and after
fred had given him a haircut and a shave
davy mather examined himself in the
mirror with a curious half smile dont
look quite so much like an owlhooter
  been in to see eben yet fred said
  not yet
  davy went out to the street and stood
at the sidewalks edge shaping up a ciga-
rette looking around fred hardy had
been right everything was the same
pineville didnt change it was a remote
world far removed from the dust-fogged
rivers of hoofs and horns that flowed
north out of texas and the gun-belted
men that rodded them-or rustled them
  davy mather took a slow drag at his
cigarette having for the first time an
awareness of the gun slung at his hip and
feeling some small embarrassment pine-
ville men didnt pack six-shooters hla
glance swung toward the bank thinking
about eben about the solid respectable
pattern of pineville the name mather
was interwoven into this pattern with
inflexible design
  davy mathers eye touched the loung-
ers on the gallery of oddie orrums stor
the forming group by the post office over
at the depot andy parker the agent wu
trundling a baggage truck along the plat-
form marking preparation for the arrival
of the noon train
  davys glance moved on to the hotel
and came hard against will tracey on
the gallery his lids pinched down if
will was around neal and dade wouldnt
be far off
  davy thought about this as he angled
slowly across the street toward the bank
the traceys had left a red scar of out-
lawry all across the nations and on into
kansas robbing trains and banks ripping
open the trail towns with their brawling
and the flame of their guns
there was coolness in the bank cool-
ness in the eyes of eben mather when
he looked up and saw davy standing
there neither spoke for a little and davy
felt the edge of that old hostility there
had always been a dark gulf between them
-the oldest and the youngest of the
mather boys it had been one of the rea-
sons davy had gone away
  so youre back davy eben said
finally
  just like a had penny davy said
with a tight smile somehow he had felt
that eben might be glad to see him after
five years away
   ebens scrutiny took in the soiled stet-
son with its rolled brim the faded levis
the scuffed boots resting finally on the
gun-belt with marked disapproval so
youre a gun-toter now
  it would be useless davy thought to
attempt to point out to eben that on those
roaring trails he had traveled a six-shoot-
er was as much a part of a cowboy as his
spurs eben wouldnt understand
trouble rides from texas

  we never did see things the same
davy said ignoring ebens scornful
thrust
  it makes you look ridiculous eben
said stiffly
  eben didnt drink or smoke he went
to church on sunday his pride had al-
ways been a strong polished surface that
marred easily davy remembered so
afraid of what people would say
  reckon yuh would just as lief i stayed
away davy said
  i have a position to maintain eben
said and the thought of a mather strut-
ting around with a gun on is not pleasing
to me
  dont fret davy said his temper ris-
ing i wouldnt figger on stayin long
he added hows dad an amos an
jason 
  father is quite well eben said stiffly
he is out at the ranch with amos jason
is building a new home
  reckon ill ride out an see dad after
i eat davy said
  do eben said he speaks of you
often i appreciate the fact that you have
written him occasionally
  on the way to the hotel davy met od-
die orrum the little store-keeper seemed
genuinely glad to see him well well
davy
  howdy mister orrum
  weve been hearin about ye
  when pineville folks had asked about
davy his father would say why davy
is fine got a letter just the other day
from ogallala nebraska he was head-
in north with a granville stuart trail
herd or perhaps it had been dodge
city or abilene
  last we heard ye was trailin em
north with ab blocker oddie orrum
went on
  the big drives are about done davy
said
  oddies glance touched the gun-belt
expect pineville seems pretty tame to
ye
  its different from trail towns davy
said
  ever git to see any of them gun-
fighters like this doc holiday an bill
hickok
  ive seen a few
  asa hooker here in town was back
in ellsworth kansas a year ago an was
tellin about a feller they called the cimar-
ron kid
  i heard of him davy said
  asa showed us a piece that was in the
ellsworth reporter about him oddie
said come up with a texas trail herd
a big fight started an this cowboy helped
out the marshal one night when a gang of
toughs jumped him
  davy watched will tracey walking
across from the hotel to the drug store
corner he saw neal then coming on
past the bank the traceys were wearing
derby hats and town clothes eben came
out of the bank and neal stopped for a
word with him after a little he went on
to join will who said something that
turned neals glance toward davy math-
er
  davys lips tightened and a hardness
came into his face how long have those
hombres in the hard hats been in town
  a week-ten days oddie said been
dickerin fer some minin property up

they alone davy queried the man

feller with em oddie nodded at an ac-
quaintance  then turned to davy again

  i dont know might stay to help
amos with fall roundup if he needs a
hand
  kinda hard fer a fiddle-foot to put
down roots i expect oddie said but
the saddlehorn is a good country davy
davy mather went on toward the hotel
slowly turning over in his mind the names
that had been associated with will and
neal tracey back there in kansas there
had been a man called luke fargo who
had given town marshals a bad time and
sonny tate gangling baby-faced-a kil-
ler dade the younger of the three tra-
ceys was a vicious hard-bitten youth
more inclined to treachery than any of
them
  davy was nearly finished with his meal
when will and neal entered the dining
room they came to his table and will
said aint i seen you before
mebbe davy said
  ellsworth want it neal said he
had slightly protruding eves which
pressed hard against davy mather yuh
was with that texas bunch
  anythin wrong with that davy fin-
ished the last bite of his pie drained his
coffee cup
   there was a little trouble will said
with these texicans an that badge-
toter
  yuh was on the wrong side kid
neal said dont let it happen agin
davy brought out cigarette tobacco and
papers shaped a cigarette and got up
slowly hunting a match yuh aint
meanin yore lookin trouble the
match hand came up fast and hard the
blow caught neal tracey on the side of
the head and sent him crashing back
against a table
   thats bad kid will tracey said his
eyes hot dangerous very bad
  the waitress screamed ben briden
the hotel proprietor rushed in from the
office and was stopped suddenly by the
danger there
  davy mather was facing the traceys
his hand poised above his holster neal
had regained his balance and the finger
of his right hand were clawdng for the
blind gun inside of his shirt will moved
in between them his voice sharp-pitched
stop it neal
   the man dont live who can lay hia
hands on me neal snarled hoarsely hia
face livid with fury
   use yore head will said
   davys blue eyes were as cold as glacier
 ice he saw neals mad play stopped by
 wills cooler head and his spread fingers
 relaxed just keep out of my way thats
 all he swung on his heel and went out
 past the open-mouthed ben briden
davy mather geared his horse at
the livery bam and rode slowly down
the street savage thoughts running
through him excited townsfolk were
clotted in front of the hotel and their eyea
turned toward him the high sound of
their voices hushed and against this si-
lence he heard someone say its davy
mather
  davys mind went back across the
years when devilment was raised in
church or at school or the high voice of
the chink laundryman screamed a protest
of some new prank shocked citizens
would cry its that davy mather
there had been those who dourly pre-
dicted that he would come to no good end
those who said good riddance when he
went away
   davy could see ebens look of horror
when he came down the street from that
haughty mansion and learned that he had
been in a scrape that he had crossed
men with whom the bank hoped to do
business his lips thinned and he looked
straight ahead facing toward the white
curving road that led into the great valley
of the saddlehorn and on to the old math-
er ranch
  dan mather greeted his son with a
great bear hug and a shout of joy davy
boy yere a sight fer sore eyes he
stood back then regarding the lean
bronzed figure pridefully my ye have
growed up
   big somber amos slapped davy on the
back shook his hand back fer good ye
fiddle-footed young hellion
  davy smiled wryly at his brother
mebbe mebbe not
   amos pulled out davys aix-shooter
trouble rides from texas

and examined it big gun fer a kid
dont see no notches on it
  a gunman dont have to advertise
davy said
  so ye figger yere a gun-slinger how
good can ye shoot
  fair
  amos gave his attention to the gear
then with a cowmans interest double-
cinch eh
  texas style is to tie hard an fast
davy said with the center-fire rig you
folks use when a critter hit the end of
the rope youd be travelin in different di-
rections
  ill still take a single cinch an a rope
long enough to use a dally amos said
spanish california buckaroo fashion
   cattle drives from texas brought in
those kind of rigs some years ago dan
mather said but they found no favor
met a couple feller campin at the
old miners cabin up in the timber on
tumbledown crick a few days ago said
amos they had texas rigs
  davys eyes narrowed what did they
look like
  one was heavy-set dark complected
said amos the other was younger baby-
faced they want very sociable but
spoke of workin for some man interested
in minin property
  it sounded like luke fargo and sonny
tate all right davy reflected evidently
kansas had gotten too hot for the tracey
gang and they had headed for california
  its good to have ye home agin
davy said dan mather id hope ye
make up your mind to stay
  sure stick around young feller
amos said he added with a chuckle i
want to see what happens when ye pile
that short-length texas reata on one of
our big steeri
  i guess ye stopped in to see eben
didnt ye dan mather said
  yes davy said with a grimace i
did an he offered me a dollar to go eat
at the hotel
  thats just his way said amos he
means all right
  davy laid nothing of the trouble at the
hotel he felt that his father and amos
would hear about it soon enough and it
was going to hurt
  eben has been worried of late too
dan mathtt said theres been con-
siderable panic talk in the san francisco
papers and the bank is holding a lot of
mortgage paper
  the pineville bank is the backbone of
the country said amos and eben real-
izes his responsibility he has loaned
money against his better judgment at
times now he is trying to build up hi
cash reserve by turning some of that paper
into money if anything happened to the
hank a lot of folks would lose everything
they have
  banks dont bother me said davy
if i got a dollar i spend it if i aint-
well theres always a job
  a rolling stone gathers no moss as
eben would tell you amos said with a
slow smile
  money isnt everything said dan
mather if you have grown in wisdom
davy the years have not been wasted
davys lips thinned and his hand slid
slowly down across his holster what i
learned he said i learned the hard
way
  back on the texas trails the name
davy mather meant nothing but men
knew of the cimarron kid reckless head-
strong steel-nerved a blue-eyed young
puncher ready to whoop it up when rid-
ers hit town quick to throw his pony into
the teeth of those clashing horns when the
cattle started to run one of the first to
grab his gun when trouble started
  davy mather lay awae a long time
that night staring into the blackness
nursing the resentment that eben had set
smouldering inside of him eben and his
stiff pride-the almighty dollar his god
eben for all of his wiseness suckered
into the traceys game theyd clean him
like a crooked gambler would clean a
greenhorn
   well let em davy told himself its
none of my affair i aint good enough to
be invited to his house when i come home
after five years away i aint good enough
to stick my nose in his business 
  davy thought then of fred hardy and
oddie orrum-of their hearty greetings
if anything happened to the link they
stood to lose along with a lot more fine
folks and there was his father and amos
and jason yes and even eben in the
saddlehorn ootmtry th name mather

 story western magazine
stood for honor and straight fair-dealing
  came the remembrance of that night
in ellsworth hed hated town marshals
throwing the law at texas trail men yet
when the traceys and their crowd of
roughs backed the badge-toter against the
wall he had sided him when the show-
down came because it seemed the right
thing to do
  reckon im still a mather davy said
aloud and fell into a deep and peaceful
sleep
down at the corral the next morning
when amos was laying out the days
riding davy said think ill take a ride
up tumbledown crick an see if them men
with the texas rigs are still at the old
cabin
  sure amos said he watched davy
buckling on his gun-belt with a curious
half smile wearin a gun gets to be
sort of a habit i expect
  sometimes it comes in handy davy
said
  he passed the favorite pools when he
had fished when he was a kid and watched
the quick dart of trout with the same
pleasant excitement he had known as a
youngster creeping stealthily to the
banks edge with his willow pole and the
worm-baited hook
  he followed the creek trail into the
timber and noticed fresh hoofprints head-
ing downstream when he came to the
clearing he saw that the cabin door was
open the bars of the old pole corral were
down and there was only silence and
emptiness in the small mountain meadow
  if as he had surmised the occupants
of fhe cabin had been luke fargo and
sonny tate they had left not long before
not much doubt that will and neal tra-
cey had learned that the puncher they had
known as the cimarron kid was davy
mather apparently they had sent word
to fargo and tate
  davy followed the trail of the riders
to the edge of the timber it turned along
the foot of the mountain in the direction
of pineville
  the time was close to noon when davy
mather crossed piney creek and ap-
proached the sawmill on the outskirts of
town it was jasons mill jason had
come out of the office and he stood watch-
ing the rider a big man in his shirtsleeve
his shout as he recognized davy reached
above the high whine of the saw biting
into a log
  davy our little brother
  hullo jason
  get down here ye young scalawag i
heard ye was back
  i bet yuh did
an ye never come in to see me yes-
terday explain yourself young feller
reckon yuh know i had a little trou-
ble
  h-m seems like i did hear some talk
jason said eyes twinkling under puckered
brows but i didnt pay much attention
wouldnt be our davy if he want stirrin
up a breeze
  it was a couple men i met back in
kansas theyre bad actors jason
shaw now why eben was tellin me
they was moneyed men interested in some
local minin property
  theyre more interested in banka
said davy an express cars ever hear
of the tracey gang
  i believe i read something about
them
  it was will an neal tracey i had the
trouble with at the hotel theyre out-
laws
  jasons eyes grew grave ye sure
about that davy ye havent got theae
men mixed up with somebody else
im sure all right davy added half
apologetically guess i should have told
eben but i was sore at the way he acted
you come with me jason said
well go see him right away
  davy dropped the reins of his horse be-
side the sawmill office and walked with
his brother along the rutted roadway be-
tween the lumber piles they crossed the
spur track that led into the yard passed
the loading corrals and the freight house
beyond and came to the lower end of
depot street
  near the mouth of an alley that ran
behind a block of buildings they saw five
horses with texas-rigged saddles davy
told of the men who had been staying at
the cabin on tumbledown creek and of
the tracks leading away from there
  jason said i dont like the looks of
this and his stride quickened
  when they turned the corner davy saw
trouble rides from texas

neal tracey at the end of the block he
was standing alone at the sidewalks edge
watching across the street toward the
bank davys eyes frosted over theres
one of em he said
  as they moved up depot street davys
glance ran along the galleries probing the
shade beneath the board awnings search-
ing for others of the tracey gang they
had almost reached the bank corner when
he saw the bulk of luke fargo in front of
the post office one of the forming group
that made a ritual of waiting there for
the mail to be put up after the arrival of
the noon train
  a man in his shirtsleeves came out of
the wells-fargo office and spoke to
jason jason said howdy george
  george went up the bank steps and his
hand went out to the latch but the door
resisted him he pushed shook the door
a slow puzzlement spreading across his
face the door is locked he said
  a look of vast alarm spread across the
face of jason something is wrong he
sent a quick glance at davy standing a
little past the steps at this main street cor-
ner
  davys eye took a quick run toward the
post office and he saw luke fargo start
along the sidewalk toward the place where
neal tracey was standing toward the
rear of the bank in front of the alley that
paralleled depot street his glance came
against young dade tracey
  the pattern was clear will and sonny
tate had gone into the bank and locked
the door will knew the interior well from
his many visits there in connection with
this mining deal he knew the heavy door
of the vault would be standing open there
behind the cashiers grille the looting of
the vault would require but a few brief
minutes when they came out fargo and
neal would be there to cover their retreat
to this alley which led down behind the
block to the place where the horses stood
  davys lips drew into a hard line he
was watching neal tracey now there on
the opposite corner stand back from the
door lie told jason low-toned this
is it
sleepy pineville birds singing the
high note of the saw at the mill the
palter of the blacksmiths hammer down
the street the lacy shade of the cotton-
woods
  here and there a slack-hipped horse
stood at a hitch-rail a settlers wagon
was drawn up in front of oddie orrums
store two or three idlers occupied the
bench along the front of the saddle shop
a woman with a market basket bobbed
her sunbonnet at an acquaintance on the
sidewalk outside of the butchershop
  one of a small group on a gallery across
the street called out hi gun-toter
several faces turned toward the lean-
framed figure wearing a cartridge belt and
holster there on the bank corner and
there was a low note of laughter
  the attention of the woman in the sun-
ixjnnet was turned toward the bank by
this an instant later her scream cut
through the midday quiet a high piercing
sound that was lost in a crash of gunfire
  jonas mather moving away from the
bank door at the command of davy said
to george passmore the wells-fargo
agent theres trouble here george

  passmore had been a gun-rider on the
stage before the railroad had been built
he stood for a moment absorbing the
thing jason said this quiet warning strik-
ing out of a blue sky he turned then and
went toward the express office at a run
  the sudden departure of passmore the
hard rap of bootheels on the plank walk
pulled neal traceys bleak stare away
from davy mather and his eve jerked to
passmore with swift apprehension he
knew the agent knew that oil the wall of
the express office two doors distant from
the bank there was a sawed-off shotgun in
a rack
  neal traceys hand swept under hi
coat and wrenched out a colt  he fired
at passmore a hurried shot that did no
more damage than to smash a pane of
glass
  davy mather the cimarron kid of the
texas cattle trails brought his six-shooter
from the low-hung holster in a fluid flow
of movement that seemed almost unhur-
ried and yet was fast fargo had come up
beside neal tracey his gun leaping from
its hiding place and swinging in a rapid
blue-steel arc
  the bullet from davys crashing colt
struck luke fargo before the outlaw had
fully cocked his gun the hammer-blow
at belt-line bent him forward and he fell
slowly with the complete slackness of a
man who will not get up again
  certain that fargo and young dade
would bracket the cimarron kid with
their uns neal tracey gave his full at-
tention to george passmore in an attempt
to stop him before he reached the door of
the express office but again the bullet
was wide
  sight of the tawny cimarron kid at
the bank corner set dade tracey in mo-
tion he had no stomach for standing up
to a gun-fighter of the caliber of the kid
and he put himself quickly on past the
hitch-rail taking cover behind a saddled
horse he jerked a six-shooter from the
belt under his coat and thrust it across
the saddle
  as fargo collapsed the cimarron kid
whirled his eye searching for young
dade a gun roared and he had an aware-
ness of the wicked rush of the bullet the
gun blast set the horse to plunging and it
jerked free and spun into the street lear-
ing dade to finish his duel in the open
  dades second shot was thrown in des-
peration a wild attempt to drop this lean-
framed figure in faded levis before that
black gun jerked cimarrons bullet
slammed into the younger tracey and
turned him in against the hitch-rail he
clutched at it
  neal traceys bulging eyes rolled in
their sockets like red-veined agates leav-
ing the disappearing form of george pass-
more to whip toward the cimarron kid
with blazing savagery
  the cimarron kid had turned a quick
pivot that faced him squarely toward neal
tracey he looked all rawhide and ice
his leathery features were taut with grim
purpose
  neal traceys nerves were turned raw
at the unexpected turn of affairs his gun-
hand was a knot of steel springs wound
tight the cimarron kid was relaxed
every muscle perfectly controlled and
obedient to a disciplined brain trained to
function with precision under physical
tension
   twin concussions rocked the street and
when the sound of them had ebbed into a
silence broken only by the high song of
the saw at the mill neal tracey waj
sprawled in the yellow dust
  in the bank will tracey had been in
high spirits as he forced eben mather to
drop the packaged greenbacks into the
gunny sack at pistol point this beats
that mining proposition all hollow my
friend
  youre going to break the town
eben said his voice strained
  will tracey laughed harshly thats
your worry he went on conversational-
ly didnt know you had a gun-toter in
the family until yesterday with the
damned cimarron kid showing up when
he did we had to pull the job a bit sooner
than we intended too bad weve got to
leave the gold but were traveling light
and fast when we leave here 
  the exploding gun-fire on the street
brought will and sonny tate to the door
on the run cursing they started down
the steps six-shooters drawn to be caught
in a leaden hail of buckshot from george
passmores sawed-off shotgun
  two outlaws were dead when the final
        pun cmtimm mi pm w
only two people dared buck coll lakes vigilante gang one was a
button-and the other wat an old man   
too old to die
by charles d richardson jr
now old sam mid
rifle cradled in hia big
horny handa youre
gonna learn aametfain
clem and me we could see that
old sam was getting in his dotage
and wc figured it was best to
humor him old sam-he liked it better
that way than pa or father-was
well on into seventy though unusually
well-preserved physically he had a
game right leg and had to be helped into
the saddle at times what bothered us
most was the way he took on about coll
lake and the vigilantes
vigilantes are okay hed rant if
they have the right kind of leader that
lake skunk is ruining the organization
runnin hog-wild thats what
somebodys got to take a firm hand
i told him clem and me cleaning the sup-
per dishes  frisco was overrun with
badmen until the vigilantes buttoned
down they put the fear of god into
those gunnies coll lakes doing the same
thing here oralled a dozen rustlers and
highwaymen in the past coupla months
the men lake hanged clem added
had it cornin em caught with the
goods pure and simple
  i thought old sam would blow his top
he stood there by the wood stove draw-
ing and puffing on his pipe like one of
those volcanoes you read about old sam
took the pipe out from between his teeth
spat out the window
s

 story western magazine
  listen he bellowed and clem and
me jumped instinctively coll lake dont
bother with trials suppose his vigilantes
was to make a mistake sometime  string
up somebody innocent everybody de-
serves a hearin i helped nolan buck the
spaniards back in  fought injuns
and renegades from the mississippi clean
out here to californy but i always give
the other fella an honest break i tell you
every man boy and skunk has a right to
trial and by judas im going to do some-
thin about it
  clem and me looked at each other not
feeling too good what you going to do
old sam i said trying to sound col-
lected-like
  old sam had picked up his heavy rifle
from the corner and was making for the
door he paused those bright gray eves
of his stabbing at us from beneath his
shaggy eyebrows
  im doin some scoutin he said
heard the vigilantes are after four men
suspected of hoss-stealin so i figure ill
do some scoutin
  clem and me we stood there after old
sam had left we both were thinking
about what we hadnt told old sam name-
ly that we had joined up with the vigi-
lantes this very afternoon we wanted
to ease the news on him gentlelike now
it sure looked bad for that what if old
sam was to bust up on us while we were
out with the vigilantes tonight
  clem threw dow n his towel and grabbed
up his hat when he reached the door
lie had his gun belt buckled about his waist
   well have to risk it he said shortly
get your gun and saddle up were
due at lakes in half an hour
   slipped my pearl-handled  into its
holster followed my brother to the cor-
rals i sure hoped we wouldnt run into
old sam no telling what hed do him
dead-set against us vigilantes the way he
was
  coll lake met us in his office behind
the boulder creek grain and hardware
shop rafferty hillman and the rest of
the bunch were there already the giant
vigilante captain glared at us westons
over his thick black beard
  youre two minutes late he snapped
fall in with the rest and ride were
smoking those horse-thieves out of sutter
canyon tonight his orders were sharp
  clem and me dusted out of town with
the boys wondering where old sam was
by now there was a bright moon in th
sky and you could see as good as day
almost we rode as far as the low-lying
hills then we advanced on foot over the
scattered rocks about the canyon
  the cabin where the four slaters were
holed up snuggled in a group of cotton-
woods lake and the rest of us eased
down through the rocks i reviewed then
in my mind the facts in the case last
night bill mcclane of the bell-bar
spread had been killed in a raid on his
prize horses this morning vigilante
rafferty had spotted the slater family
riding near the canyon on four bell-bar
horses the slaters tried to feed rafferty
a cock-and-bull yarn about having bought
the horses from four other fellows an hour
previous
   rafferty had started to make his arrest
the slaters broke away hell-bent and holed
up in their cabin they had fired at the
advancing vigilante rafferty then had
ridden back to town for reinforcements
coll lake stuck his bearded face
around the side of the rock you
birds down there in the cabin he shouted
through cupped hands weve cot you
cornered come out peaceablelike and
you wont get hurt
  we all shot our guns at the cabin to
show we meant business
   there w as a dead silence in the canyon
several minutes clem and me begun to
think the quarry had skipped then a
high nervous voice yelled out you go
to blazes were innocent and we aint
gonna be took by no bunch of rope-crazy
maniacs
  the remark was punctuated by a bullet
uncomfortably close to our rock
   coll lakes face was black-set if its
war they want- he fired carefully into
one of the -windows
  there was a scream from the cabins
interior it sounded like a rabbit i once
heard being gutted by a fox i felt a little
sick our boys fired again and then a
white cloth waved frantically in the door-
way a thin tall man walked out fol-
lowed by a shorter stouter fellow a
stooped oldish man and a sixteen year-
too old to die

old kid with a bandage around his left
arm tom slater his brother and father
and young son tim
  they walked slowly toward us hands
raised tom slater in the lead was clean
shaven with the clearest bluest pair of
eyes i had ever seen i couldnt help think-
ing that he didnt look like a murdering
horsethief to me
  you fellows are wrong about us he
said quietly we didnt steal no horses
coll lake sneered expect us to be-
lieve that he said you were caught
riding bell-bar animals thats proof
enough for me bring over the ropes
rafferty
  rafferty was looking a little green about
the gills i strongly suspected he didnt
like the job any more than the rest of us
but coll lake was boss and it didnt do
to buck him the evidence was all against
those four captured men
  maybe we oughta have a trial clem
scared me by announcing just to be on
the sure side
  i thought coll lake would jump down
my brothers throat im giving the or-
ders here these men are guilty string
em up boys
  the men addressed hesitated but only
for a minute rafferty and a couple other
fellows adjusted the noose about the four
slaters necks shoved them up to the
cottonwoods the free ends of the ropes
were tossed over limbs and tied to saddle-
horns of waiting horsemen all four of
the captives looked pretty grim and white-
faced but they didnt break down like
youd expect somebody gave old matt
slater a chaw of tobacco and he worked
on it silently thoughtfully
  tim slater the sixteen year-old showed
more courage than i would have in his
shoes he just stared ahead biting his
lower lip a little
  tom and mark slater smoked quietly
on the cigarettes theyd requested
  coll lake raised his hand for the sig-
nal anything you men want to say
before you are sent on to your maker
he asked solemnly
  there was a moment of tight silence
then a shrill voice from somewhere to
the rijht of us split the night air
  plenty coll lake it shouted and we
vigilantes turned as a man toward the
jumble of rocks above they want to
say theyre innocent and that neither you
nor the rest of your so-called lawdogs
are going to hang them for it take off
them ropes you thick-headed fools before
i puts a slug through every blisterin
mothers son of yuh
  clem and me we really felt sick that
was old sam holed up there in those
boulders with his rifle our old father
tangling with the vigilantes-old sam
surely was in his dotage
  dont shoot i hollered at coll lake
thats our old man out there he-
dont mean no harm if we just humor
him get his rifle-
  coll lake already was raising his gun
humor-hell he said that old fools
dangerous hes buckin the law
  he fired before clem or me could pre-
vent it rock chips and dust flew from
the boulder protecting old sam then
almost instantly old sams rifle began
to bark and bullets sprayed amongst us
when i say sprayed i mean just that
those bullets slighted nobody coll lakes
gun jumped from his hand and the vigi-
lante captain howled in pain rafferty
right beside me gasped as a slug burned
a trough through his curly red hair
  the other boys ducked for cover clem
and me doing likewise we always had
respected old sams marksmanship and
tonight he sure didnt let us down none
old sam didnt know we were present
he didnt give us time to acquaint him
with the fact
  you there the skinny galoot with the
dirty mark for a moustache old sams
high voice ordered you got jest five
minutes to get the ropes off them four
fellers
  the vigilante addressed was ned hill-
man ned moved faster than i ever had
seen him move in three and a half min-
utes flat those four slaters were free as
the air now fanning my sweating hands
and forehead
  now old sam said iimping out
from cover rifle cradled in his big horny
hands youre gonna learn somethin
lltaybe you think it funny the bunch
of us toeing the mark to one old man
us vigilantes could have swarmed down
on old sam in a group taken away his

 story western magazine
gun and rendered him helpless the only
catch was several of us were pretty cer-
tain to go down before we reached him
none of us seemed eager to be included
among those dearly departed
  then too we all respected old sams
advancing years
  coll lake was purple to the ears but
he didnt make a dive for his fallen gun
you- he cursed you old meddler
you realize i can have you jailed for ob-
structing the law this way interfering
with a bangin and-
  old sam just kept coming on until he
was within spitting distance of the vigi-
lante leader
  law he said thats a laugh the
way you run it law-abiding folks aint
got a chance take them four fellers there
you almost just now hanged if i hadnt
come along in time theyd be half-way
along the road to glory
  coll lakes green eyes blazed theyre
murdering horse-thieves-
  old sam spat on a nearby rock thats
jusf the trouble he said you birds
dont take time to be sure me i got to
thinkin i decided to do a little inves-
tigatin on my own i did and it proved
mighty enlightenin mighty enlight-
enin
  you old goat coll lake began we
arent interested in what you-
  rafferty the redheaded vigilante
edged forward just a minute there cap-
tain he said slowly i reckon we would
like to hear a mite more about this go
on old sam what did you find out
about bill mcqanes killers
  i found out plenty he said i went
and had a talk with slater and his folks
slater told me how four men rode up
offered to trade their mounts for his said
they was from the bucket b spread up
north they offered a generous cash
bonus on each animal to boot slater
needin the money bad for livin costs and
an ailin son didnt ask questions he
didnt know them hosses was stolen
when your vigilante tried to make the
arrest slater and his kinfolk got panicky
and lit out just like any of you might
of done
  old sam looked at the lot of us and
his eyes went a little wider when he
spotted clem and me but he went right
on talking without batting ary an eyelash
  i picked up the trail of the real hoss
thieves flushed em in a valley six mile
from here they had a dozen broncs wear-
ing the mcclane bell bar brand to
shorten the story i accused em and they
made a play for it three of em wont
give you no more trouble
  his deepset eyes returned to clem and
me you two go up into them rocks and
drag out that skunk i left tied there hes
the only one left of them killers but he
sure is in a talkative mood
  clem and me we hustled up among the
rocks and sure enough there was a snort
scar-faced man trussed up and gagged
just like old sam had said we yanked
him to his feet shoved him over to coll
lake and the vigilantes where he spilled
plenty after we took the gag out of his
mouth
  the slaters returned to their cabin
they promised to return the bell-bar
horses first thing in the morning clenj
and me and the rest of us vigilantes didnt
say much but we were doing a heap of
thinking we had almost hanged four in-
nocent men and we still were feeling sick
to the stomach about it maybe thats why
we didnt raise a hand to stop old sam
from doing what he did to coll lake
then
  old sam well up in his seventies and a
full three inches shorter than the vigi-
lante captain swung out with that horny
right fist of his the blow caught coll
lake squarely in the middle of his bearded
jaw lake went down like a mule had
kicked him
just wanted to show you boys old
sam said calmly dusting off his hands
what comes of havin the wrong leader
rafferty jumped in front of old sam
as the latter was leaving
  we admit we had the wrong leader
he said hurriedly we sure as hell re-
gret it but now we got to have another
a guy with guts and a level head we
want you for our new vigilante captain
old sam how about it
  old sam looked at him then he
looked over at clem and me and he
winked old sam spat
  ill think it over he said right

you cant make a man a lawdog
by hanging a tin badge on him-
nor keep a corbin from being
one by taking it off
ed corbin lifted his eyes hopefully
as a shadow fell on the threshold
of the smithy it was not business
he saw only old christianson the town
busybody ed tried to keep the disap-
pointment out of his eyes and his voice
as he nodded at the old man
  mornin dave whats trouble  you
look bet up about somethin
  if you knowed what i know said the


 story western magazine
 old man in his raspy accent you wouldnt
look so calm neither jug ewald has took
off on another rampage
j how that ed gulped you
mean-
   i mean when lucas went for to open
 the saloon up this momin he found the
 place in a shambles cash box was rifled
 of the small change lucas keeps in it and
 there was a good fifty dollars worth of
 booze missin that jugs goin to be a
 mighty hard cat to handle by the time
 he gets full of that drinkin likker
 excuse me dave ed said he took
 off the big leather apron he wore to pro-
 tect himself while at his anvil and forge
 and swung out onto grove street a thin
 sober-faced man with a light of intelligence
 about hia brown eyes which seemed out of
 place in a man of his calling
   where you goin in sich a hurry
 asked the old man
   up to my dads house ed said be
 just like him to try to ride out after tug
 sick as he is but theres a limit to a law-
 mans duty jugs mean enough to kill
 a man and jesses gun reputation aint
 going to scare him
   mebbe youre fixin to go out and haul
 jug in yourself ed the old town idler
 cackled eds slender shoulders stiffened
 under the weight of dave christiansons
 sarcasm and it was in him to turn and
 fling a retort at the old man he didnt
 bother his mind was full of the scene he
 was about to have with old jesse
   it was a good many weeks since hed
 had any words at all with his father   
 in a way he supposed this situation
 was more his own fault than any one
 elses in his minds eye he could picture
 once more that fateful day in front of the
 cattlemens bank when cutbank billy
 eagan and the jory brothers hall and
 tom had come charging out throwing
 lead as fast as their guns could work
   it had been whang-leather-tough old
 jesse corbin bent creek town marshal
 and his son and deputy ed in a shoot-
 out with those three reckless outlaws
   jesses first shot had caught billy earan
 through the stomach sent him jackknifing
 into the dust of the street coughing
 gurgling his lifes blood out
   hall jory spanked a slug into eds
 shoulder ed was flmng bade against the
wall of staples hardware he braced
himself there firing deliberately at hall
jory and he hit his man right through
the chest but not before tom jory had
plugged ed through the side
  ed had come to a good twelve hours
later with doc lang breathing his whisky
breath down on him with ellen standing
tearfully above him with the two kids
janie and jesse lurking with frightened
eyes in the background
  his dad was there too he would al-
ways remember the triumphant expres-
aion on his dads leathery thin face as the
old man clapped spindly doc lang be-
tween the shoulder blades
  by damn doc jesse said whatd
i tell you you cant kill a corbin
you can come mighty close said doc
lang pulling a pint bottle from his pocket
and taking a long pull on it son how
you feelin
  the answer to that was too weak to
talk ed managed a wan smile and again
his father clapped the little medico on
the back
  one thing about the corbins is they
always come up smilin no matter what
well ellen jesse swung toward eds
tearful wife you can dry them purty
eyes now tell the young uns their
daddys goin t be good as new he
chuckled you cant kill a corbin   
aint that so ed
  ed couldnt move his lips to reply he
moved an eyebrow and jesse acted as if
that made his only son into a real special
hero thats all right boy just you
take it easy well get outta here now
an let you rest by the way i kilt tom
jory dead as a doornail case you
wondered
  ed hadnt given the matter a thought
he was too preoccupied with a more per-
sonal problem he had a lot of time to
think during the next several weeks
  one day jesse came in to see him and
ed handed back the deputys badge jesse
had pinned on him months ago down in
the law office
  the old mans mustache jerked as his
mouth opened whats this for
  i wont be needing that any more
dad
  why not in tarnation
  im not taking part in any more man-
breed of the lawdog

hunts from now on im going to con-
centrate on the smithy
  the old man took a gold toothpick from
his vest pocket and went through an
elaborate pantomime of removing foreign
matter from between his teeth when he
spoke again there was an edge of steel
in his raspy voice
  and jest how he said did you
come by sech a crazy idea
  i decided ive done my share of up-
holding the law in this town dad ive
risked my life plenty of times and now
its costing me a pretty penny of business
lost at the smithy i was watching ellen
and the kids pretty close that day when
i finally got my eyes open they thought
i was dead dad i aint going to put
ellen and the kid through that kind of a
wringer again
the old mans gray eyes burned at
him as if trying to see right inside
him you an meve always been mighty
close ed always made me proud the
way we can speak out in meeting to each
other im gunna speak out right now
go ahead dad
  i say youre talkin like a dad-blamed
young idiot ed
  i didnt really expect that youd un-
derstand dad
  boy wheres your brains you know
what this townll say if you hand back
that deputys badge now theyll say
you turned on your daddy theyll say-
and ill say that a mans first loyalty
is to his wife and children even more
than to his father
  mebbe theys logic in that im
willin to see it bein your father this
town aint your father though ed this
town aint goin to see a dad-blamed thing
but the fact that you got yourself shot up
an come a close call and decided that
deputys badge would look purtier on
some other vest
  eds brown eyes met those of his father
  you savin im yellow dad
  the older man shifted on his long legs
and flung an uneasy glance out the win-
dow
  im tellin you not to be a dad-blamed
fool youll lose a whole lot more black-
smithin business to charlie ingram if
you at this town rikd up at you ed
  why should they rile ive done my
share ive taken my chances why
shouldnt i be able to live a peaceable
life now
  dag nab it becuz youre a corbin for
one thing the corbins has always been
tough and- hell boy you know i been
hopin youd take over this badge of mine
some day
  ed shook his head slowly i never
will dad im sorry
  an why wont you
  ed let a moment pass then said be-
cause i think too much of ellen
  youre talkin like a daggone hollow-
belly dude the older man suddenly ex-
ploded you ask me you think too much
of ed corbin
  he had gone rampaging out slamming
the door leaving ed to lie there frowning
against the pillow he had thought that
jesse would finally come around to his
way of thinking but the tough old badge
toter had been cut too deeply by eds de-
cision ed was his only son the only
kin he had in this world and jesse needed
to be proud of ed the way most men need
food for their stomachs
  
  and now jug ewald the towns number
one trouble maker had broken into lucas
saloon during the night had stolen lucas
cashbox full of small change and a supply
of booze and ed had made a beeline
straight to his fathers house where he
knew the old lawdog was convalescing
after his most recent attack of lung trou-
ble the white-mustached old man re-
ceived eds news sourly
  whatre you so white about the
old man croaked at him you aint wear-
in a deputys badge these days
  dad youre in no shape to go out
there to jugs place you been down sick
an youre still weak as a kitten
   jesse corbin fingered the ends of the
long white mustache sick or well i
reckon i got enough manhood in me to
cut jug ewald down to the size of his
britches
  why cant you wait a while ed
said you know how jug is when he
gets his hands on a supply of booze hes
wooeti a rattlesnake an twioa as dan-

 story western magazine
gerous with them damn henry rifles out
there at his cabin but if youd give him
time to drink himself-
  into a stupor hey said jesse corbin
so i could go out there and clap irons
on him while he was unconscious
whats wrong with that
  nothin much said old jesse in a
deceptively soft voice then his gray
eyes hardened  cept that i aint that
kind of a lawman now suppose you iust
hustle your hocks on outta here ed
but-
  drag it cant you tell when a mans
busy
  dad you cant-
  ill tell you what i cant do i cant
stand here and listen to any more of your
notions how to make a safe job out of
toting a law badge it aint a safe job
never will be i knowed that when i
pinned the badge on  aint never ducked
around trouble and im a mite too old
to be startin
  ed took an outsized red handkerchief
from his pocket and w-iped his damp
forehead he looked down at the mono-
gram his mother had stitched into one
corner of the cloth before making him a
birthday present of it one long ago day
  remember this dad mom gave it to
me
  what about it
  nothin just thinkin how shed hate
seein us squared off at each other this
way if she was still livin
  the older mans face went dead sober
the old eyes started to film then jesse
wiped his nose with an impatient finger
and snapped aint no proper time for
a man to be thinkin them kind of soften-
up thoughts ed i got a tough job ahead
of me
  reluctantly ed stuffed the red hand-
kerchief in his hip pocket dad i wish
youd wait
  the old mans unpredictable temper
hared up an i wish youd haul your
freight on outta here tf you cant act
uie part of a corbin the least you can
do is keep clear youre worsell a calami-
ty-howlin female i swear if they was any
corbin blood in you it sure must of bled
out when you was in that bank ruckus   
now skedaddle youre - i me
nervous
  ed stood there wondering where his
duty lay should he go as jesse com-
manded and permit the old man to ride
out to jug ewalds cabin straight into a
heap of gun trouble he was in no physical
shape to cope with or should he pre-
vent his father from going out there
by force
  he considered that thought only for a
brief instant for old jesse was snap-
ping you hear me say git
  the long white mustache quivered at-
testing to the degree of jesses impatience
now and the thin leathery face was red
as a barn roof hell have a stroke ed
thought if i keep whittling at him he
turned to go
  next time i want to talk to you ed
the old man said ill tell you then
as ed paused in the door the unpre-
dictable old man changed his tack once
again i spose you meant well enough
wasnt no need for you to worry cant
kill a corbin
cant kill a corbin ed thought as
he walked back up semple street
to the corner of semple and grove his
father had said it a thousand times more
or less why why would a man say
a thing like that over and over be-
cause he believed it or perhaps because
lie wanted to believe it because it was
necessary for him to believe it in order
to keep up his courage which after all
was the stock-in-trade of a town marshal
  but you can kill a corbin you can
kill old jesse the shape hes in especial-
ly you can kill jesse if your name is jug
ewald and youre barricaded in your
cabin with two henry rifles and a supply
of whisky
  ed took the red handkerchief out of his
pocket and again wiped globules of per-
spiration from his worried forehead sud-
denly his slight legs began to move faster
until he was going at a half walk half
jo down grove toward the smithy and
then he was running
  the big long-coupled bay gelding be-
longed to slim cottrell who rode for
teakettle the bay was newly shod and
rea y to go fd knew slim cottrells
town habits knew that the tanny would
be too busy in lucas saloon the next
three-four hours to be calling for his horse
breed of the lawdog

at the smithy in the interim between
 ed flung a saddle on the bay and rode
out davis alley toward the ridge trail
and the shortcut over the notch that
would take him to jug ewalds cabin
  if he rode like a demon if jesse took
his time and went the longer but easier
way which seemed likely considering the
old mans physical condition ed ought
to have a half hour out there alone with
jug ewald
he tie
      tied the bay to a juniper tree a
quarter mile from the cabin and walked
carefully toward it on foot as he came
into the cleared ground that bordered
the path to jug ewalds spring he could
see smoke curling from jugs chimney
he stepped down onto the path and
would have continued toward the cabin
had not a slug whined past his head gone
spanging into a tree behind him
  he heard the sound of that henry rifles
explosion from inside the cabin and then
jugs voice high pitched strident with
emotion thickened by booze
 one more step forward an ill cor-
rect my aim some ed them big buttons
acrost your frontd make a right interestin
target whatta you want
  talk with you jug ed called to the
man who lurked behind that threatening
rifle within the cabin
 go ahead im a-listenin
 you was always more hospitable lhan
that jug i could sure use me a mouthful
of what you been guzzling
 what you want out here ed you
reppin for your old man in his sickness 
i cant talk so eaay jug with that
rifle trained on me
 dont tell me you got your nerve
back you back to wearin one of them
deppity badges
  do i get that drink jug ed took a
step forward gingerly like a man walk-
ing on rollers
  youll get a mouthful of lead if you
aint damn careful take that gunbelt
off nice and easy drop it in the dirt an
well talk about drinkin whisky his
voice slurred howd you know i was
hjfvin a booze party
  ed kept his hands in front of him and
took another step forward
  you hear me tell you to drop them
guns jug ewald snarled from behind
the long henry rifle the barrel jabbed
toward ed through the window sunlight
glinting off its blue surface
  you wouldnt shoot me jug ed
said you know youd hang for it
try me said the booze-crazed man
in the cabin take another step towards
me ed jest try me
  ed stood there testing the temper of
his opponent another brief moment it
came to him that beyond any doubt jug
ewald would shoot him down in cold
blood if pressed to it further ed said
i aint going to put my head in a lions
mouth jug reckon ill drop the guns
just be damn careful about it i aint
in no mood to fool with you or nobody
ed unbuckled his gunbelt and dropped
it on the ground
  do i rate that drink now
  i aint drinkin with jesse corbins
son said jug ewald in a suddenly harsh
inflection i spent too much time in jail
on that old he-devils account
  ed heard that warning tone in the
voice like the noise of a rattlesnake get-
iate to shave your upper up
                                                try a star blade on those tough stubble patches

ting ready to strike at a helpless victim
he could almost smell the ugliness of jug
ewalds intention he saw the sunspots
shift on the rifle barrel as it moved slight-
ly in jug ewalds hands then flame
belched from it even as ed dropped fran-
tically to the ground
  he was a slight man and agile for a
blacksmith he caught his gunbelt in one
hand and rolled as he fell hauling the
clattering weight of those sixguns with 
him he rolled toward the cabin not away
from it and came up close to the wall
where jug ewalds black eyes and search-
ing rifle barrel could not be brought to
train on him
  he said panting im going to kill
you for that jug hear mep
  there was no sound from within the
cabin ed stood frozen against the logs
of the wall - took one gun out of a
holster and dropped the belt to the
ground
  come on out with your hands up jug
yoy dont have a chance and you know
it youre drunk ill kill you sure if
you try to make a fight of it
yfore silence from within the cabin
-l-- ed stood there waiting waiting un-
willing to breathe hard for fear jug
ewald could use that sound to locate his
position against the wall and so shoot
liim
  he heard a rumble of curses then a
sound which could have been only a shat-
tering whisky glass flung aside in a fit of
temper what he saw next was a sight
he would remember down the long years
till he lay on his deathbed first one
henry rifle then the other hurtled
through the window beside him and lay
harmless upon the packed earth of jugs
pathwgy
  the front door of the cabin swung
creakily inward and jug ewald himself
staggered into the aperture stood there
unsteadily frowning into the brightness
of late-morning sunlight he was drunk
as a hoot owl and at the same time cold
bober which a man sometimes can be
as ed knew when he heard jug ewald
saying 
  i aint goin to tangle with you ed
tm drunk an like you say youd likely
kill me if i kilt you theyd hang me i
aint so drunk im willin to hang for
stealin a couple handsful of silver an a
dozen bottles of whisky    you never
had to duck down so fast ed- i was still
just scare-shootin at you figgerpd to
get your guns and run you off my land
you was too quick for me
  ed looked into the bleary eyes and
knew suddenly that the man was telling
the truth lets go inside and have that
drink jug
  they did ed searched the cabin and
could find no more guns my pops on
his way out here jug im takin those
henrys along with me- just you give
yourself up to pop nice and peaceful
and never mention me bein out here and
i give you my word i wont tell the court
nothin about bow you tried to gun me
youll get off a whole lot easier than
youve got any right to  is it a deal
all right ed said jug ewald and
he whined just a little i never meant
to plug you i was-
  the judge ed said might not take
your word for that jug
  he went out hurriedly picked up his
gunbelt and the two henry rifles and
walked toward the tethered bay gelding
not even glancing back at the frightened
face of the man who remained in the
cabin the undergrowth was thick as he
left the path to reach the tethered horse
  he was tanging a redhot shoe from the
forge later that day when his father
strode into the smithy  lo dad ed
said smoothly dave christianson was in
a few minutes back to say youd rode in
with jug ewald- no trouble at all hey
thats right ed the old man said
no trouble
  guess i shouldnt have worried
guess not said jesse no need of
it he come like a lamb    i-uh-i
aint a man that likes to admit bein wrong
ed but it could be ive spoke out of turn
towards you thinkin back on the fights
you an me been in together pear t me
you can stand on your record
  he turned to go then paused in the
door of the smithy by the way i found
that red handkerchief of ypurs hangin on
a catclaw bush near where you had your
horse tethered this mornin next time

ever their eyes met she put on an arro-
gant look and turned away she spoke
to suggs now in a quiet voice and his
toothless jaws clamped shut to hold back
what he wanted to say
  cap andre trailing again as usual
said who did this
  kell arbo canted his head toward tott
hang-tree trail

you would have to hire a blue-nose fed
who cant take a little ribbing wouldnt
you he remarked critically
  you dirty lyin crook tott flared sud-
denly you-
  i heard the shot and saw cobb drop
kell arbo broke in curling the black twist
of hair that always hung in his left eye
then crovett came across and tried to
hide in the brush
  you liar tott flared you cooked
this up so-
  dont call me a liar kell roared giv-
ing tott a hard shove with the muzzle of
his gun
  tott slammed into the chuckwagon
headfirst and pots and pans clattered
suggs yelped angrily most of them
laughed tott straightened slowly and
turned to face them many times during
the past weeks when most men would
have let their tempers fly regardless of con-
sequences tott had taken a strangle-hold
on his own and held it in check but now
at last he opened up and told them what
he thought you dirty mean snivelling
no-goods he started in pointing at cobb
theres the only man in the bunch of
you he hated my guts for being a yan-
kee as much as any of you but he was
honest and he knew his business and thats
more than can be said for any of the rest
of you get him buried pay your respects
or are you all so tickled youve got an ex-
cuse to hang me you want to keep him
lying around that looks like your style
and im fed to the teeth with it if youre
texans give me anything else ive stom-
ached you for a year and a half and the
only thing any of you ever thought of all
the while was how to get my nose in the
dirt and keep it there why should i kill
cobb because i couldnt take a hurraw-
ing  that would put me in the same class
with you and i wouldnt like it down
there i think i know who killed cobb-
his eyes raked kell arbo briefly from
head to foot -but i reckon it aint worth
mentioning to you
  what about this empty catridge 
bub yorey broke in his eyes smokey with
anger
  figure it out for yourself if it wont
give you brain fever tott crovet an-
swered
  kell arbo stalked forward his eyes
blazing when he was close enough he
struck tott across the face with the flat
of his hand first on one side then the
other totts head flopped and buzzed and
his blood boiled he braced a leg against
the wagon-wheel and struck arbo a blow
in the face that sounded like a cook slap-
ping a chunk of meat with the flat of his
cleaver kell arbos head whipped back
and tott gave him another blow in the
stomach doubling him up he staggered
in a tight circle swinging his gun like a
club it caught tott across the legs rip-
ping his pants across both legs and cutting
a gash across his thighs but arbo lost
his balance doing it and went to the
ground his gun whipping out of sight un-
der the chuckwagon
  suggs let out a shrill yell his eyes glit-
tering with wild turmoil red umley and
the nolan boys stood apart whispering
among themselves cap andre lifted his
hands trying to think of something to stop
it
  dont nobody butt in kell arbo
warned ill kill him with my bare hands
  he looked like he could do it veteran
of a hundred bar-room brawls each with
its mark upon him what he knew totted
up to something a man didnt learn any
other way his hat sailed off his head his
unruly hair poured down over his eyes
and he came in like a charging buffalo
he struck and tott went to his knees
arbo beat him on the head with both fists
he stomped the calves of totts legs he
hooked his bootheels behind totts ankles
and tried to break his bones finally he
grabbed a foot and swung tott in a cir-
cle working back toward the wagon
wheel so he could brain him but he
tripped on the uneven ground before he
fot that far and went down with a thud
osing his hold tott rolled out his mo-
mentum and came to his feet bracing him-
self against the wheel his chest heaving
his eyes smoky with wrath the fury of
arbos fist still thumping in his head
  arbo rushed him again tott raised
himsek on the wheel and kicked out with
both feet one boot caught arbo on the
chin and his teeth snapped like a bear-
trap he went to his back again and rolled
coming up on all fours working his sore
jaw and wincing with pain he made a
swipe at totts boot with one hand but

 story western magazine
missed then jumped forward like a frog
head boring for totts belly tott side-
stepped the charge and arbo crashed into
the wagon-box tott gave him a hard rab-
bit punch that staggered him he lurched
around in a tight circle his eyes rolling
  tott bored in again and gave him more
one blow doubled him up and he hugged
his belly yowling with pain half-blind
lie rammed forward again tott backed off
trying to keep out of reach but somebody
stuck out a boot and tripped him he went
down flat and arbo jumped him again
raking and kicking until he exhausted
himself he was in no condition now to
carry out his boast to kill tott crovet
with his bare hands but tott didnt know
it for some time to come a vicious blow
struck him in the head and knocked him
senseless
  before long kell arbo and red umley
came back and said they had found a tree
arbo was in bad shape he held his arm
across his stomach and moved his jaw
carefully wdien he spoke you might
know a stinker like that would light dirty
he muttered get a move on red
umley got a horse off the picket line
and loaded tott aboard aches and pains
included kell arbo went ahead with the
smoky lantern red umley led the horse
the nolan boys followed behind
  i dont see why we cant wait till
mornin to hang him bub yorey mut-
tered theres no rush
  lie didnt wait to plug cobb kell
i-narled over his shoulder
  jo andre stayed in camp but before
they reached the creek she came running
and made a commotion cap andre tried
to quiet her and finally went back to cam
with her yorey cussed and then they all
wrapped themselves in bleak silence until
they found the tree kell arbo had picked
out
  hells blind mice someone exploded
when he saw it thats no tree thats a
bush
  its the biggest around here the new-
trailboss snapped throw the rope over
tliat branch there red
  until now for yorey and the other
sprouts this had been a pastime like the
rest of their hurraw ing a new way to twist
a yankee tail but now they began to turn
a little pale around the gills and moved
back step by step letting arbo umley
and the two nolan boyg handle it young
casson usually full of starch and bluster
suddenly turned and stumbled back to
camp the rest of them gulping to lubri-
cate their lumpy throats whispered and
twittered among themselves like birds in
the bushes oddly enough suggs the old
fire-eater wouldnt have anything to do
with this hanging and had gone to bed
  kell arbo looked things over then
stepped to the horse and slapped it on the
rump tott slid off behind and dropped
his heart jumping to his throat the rope
jerked and twanged and tott heard the
sudden intake of breath all around him
shame and humiliation touched him the
most because he had seen this done in the
war and knew how ludicrous a man
looked dangling from a rope twisting and
squirming like a headless chicken then
his feet touched the ground and he stood
on tiptoe neck stretched so his breath
wheezed out of his throat
  i k no wed that damn branch wouldnt
isold someone growled anybody could
a seen that 
  bub yorey stepped forward and cut the
rope tott sagged to the ground and
caught his breath kell arbo swore and
had a hurried talk with umley then he
strode back to camp letting who wanted
pick up the pieces
  belter luck next time yank yorey
muttered getting back his lip
  somebody laughed and tott was back
where he started the butt of their heritage
of hate
casson who had stumbled away too
soon to see what happened was throwing
his stuff together and getting ready to pull
out when tott got back to camp jo
andre showing in her eyes all the wild
turmoil she had gone through glanced
swiftly at tott then turned away too un-
steady to say anything suggs had one eye
open watching everything his toothless
face twisted sardonically but he didnt
get up kell arbo watched cassons flur-
ried preparations for some time and fi-
nally said just what do you think youre
hang-trbe trail

goin to do kell glared down at him
  im pullin out cassons answered
im goin home any objections
well dont you want your pay
why-why sure
  arbo walked toward him fishing in his
pocket casson waited innocently sur-
prised at the oiler there then arbo
said when he was close enough and hit
him in the face a shocking completely
unexpected blow that turned casson
glassy-eyed a sound fluttered on his lips
but before he got it out his neck kinked
his knees buckled and he went down like
a shot horse kell chuckled and turned
to the rest anybody else got any funny
notions 
  well not just now i guess yorey
drawled give us time
  i dont want no more of that arbo
snapped and while were at it i might
as well lay down a little law that goes
from now on gather round
  arbo had a whole headful of law lie
said he w as worried about the remuda be-
cause they wore in indian country and he
assigned two men to go out and stand
watch with the wrangler every night from
now on he also doubled the herd night
guard so that when he got through there
wasnt much of anyone left in camp
  when do we sleep yorey inquired
mounting to ride off lo the bed-ground
  next month when you get to dodge
now get a move on therell be no more
round-sidin or dodgin work around here
get that through your heads an keep it
there
  what about him yorey asked
pointing at tott
  dont worry about him arbo an-
swered well find another tree
rpkeks were few and far between the
land was deep in grass that whispered
a constant song above the low rumble of
the moving herd but day after day not a
tree showed its fuzzy blur against the
horizon tott crovet had his liberty so
he could help with the herd but he didnt
get hack his gun and he rode beat-up
horses so he wouldnt get far if he tried
to escape everybody kept an eye on him
suggs especially he had a rifle on the
seat beside him in the chuck wagon and
boasted lie meant to use it if tott made
any kind of a move to slope out of there
  by now the crew was split wide open
into two cliques kell arbo and hi three
friends against the rest but what it would
come to tott couldnt guess ever sine
that night arbo laid down the law the
young texans had been worked and
driven to death cap andre was sick most
the time and let things go even if he had
had his health he probably wouldnt have
stood up to kell ardo because the trail-
ixiss could leave him flat and throw him
into a worse fix than he was in now tott
could have handled the drive but it would
have raised more commotion than there
was now and no one would have had the
gall to ask him he was living on bor-
rowed time for a little while only
  young casson the first to feel kell
arbos heavy hand lost his life crossing
the canadian worn out with day and
night work he went dowrn in quicksand
lost his horse and couldnt make it to
shore it might have happened regard-
less but yorey blamed kell arbo and
they had words about it now bub yorey
was getting it in the neck arbo claimed
he was stirring up talk of deserting al-
though so far tott hadnt heard anything
of the kind day in and day out he and
yorey rode drag together another thorn
in yoreys flesh he claimed it ought to
he rotated the way cobb had done but
arbo wouldnt listen one day tott
asked him pointblank about the talk but
he denied it
  youll hear plenty of it though if he
crowds me much more yorey stated i
dont give a damn what anybody says
and it wont be just talk either maybe
well all pull out
  that would make it pretty tough for
the andres
  you can take care of them yorey
answered sardonically jo doesnt want
me around anyway  his voice caught
suddenly and a bleak bitter look clouded
his eyes
  she doesnt want me either im a
yankee you know
  well dammit you can get over it
cant you 
  maybe when you get over being
johnny rebs that would clear it all up
so would a bolt of lightning
  you would sure like to have somebody
 story western magazine
feel sorry for you now wouldnt you
  yeah i would
  dont ask me to after all you know
you almost got me hung
  only almotf yorey mumbled
youd be surprised what even a little
stretching like that can do to a man it
sticks in his craw a long time and re-
member as soon as somebody sees a
likely tree im cooked
  i didnt smell any gun-smoke on your
gun that night yorey confessed sudden-
ly
  i know you didnt
  you must think im a helluva heel
i do think there could be considerable
improvement
  the fact is arbo put the words in my
mouth i know that now he rammed the
whole thing down our throats
  you liked it at the time
  yorey cussed with exasperation you
got to remember weve been mauled
around considerable
  thats what happens to anybody who
gets in a fight win or lose you got licked
and couldnt take it
  you dont need to rub it in
  i havent noticed anybody letting up
on me
  ive let up hell i get a thousand
ideas i could use to pester you and i
throw em all over my shoulder im too
damn miserable myself
  whatre you going to do when another
tree shows up are you going to speak
your piece
  what good would it do arbo knows
i hate his guts and hed claim i was
changing my tune just to block him
  i reckon thats true tott agreed
glumly
  the grass thinned out for a stretch and
dust choked them to silence slowly they
climbed a bare rise and when they
reached the top an upsweep of wind took
the dust away
  oh oh yorey muttered all at once
and pointed there she is
tte was pointing to a tree that threw
its green branches to the sky on the
far horixon and tott saw where his trail
ended his lips twisted wryly it looks
fflce a man wouldnt have any trouble
andlog a sottd branch on that he re-
marked finding humor in his tight
  hell its biggern a windmill
  well tott muttered with quiet
resignation
  i dont reckon well make it till to-
morrow
  no i reckon not
suggs topping the rise with the wagon
let out a shrill yell and pointed too
that old buzzard yorey growled
kell arbo rode up a loose-lipped grin
on his face looks like rough country
ahead crovet he remarked
  yorey scowled and started to sputter
about the way tott crovet had been rail-
roaded into this fix hell he was out
cold when we took a vote we ought to
give him his say anyway
  i always thought you was kinda
chicken-hearted yorey kell arbo
stated kinda yaller dont try to back
up thats all i got to say he had a
handful of raisins a special treat for any-
body and popped them into his mouth one
by one without offering them around
  so thats where suggs raisins went
to yorey exploded hes been belly-
achin about em all over the place for a
week
  yeah arbo agreed coolly but he
finally got a hunch who tooken em
yorey so we went through your bedroll
and there they were
  my bedroll
  yeah so you see what youre in for
i told you boys anybody caught messin
around that chuckwagon would get a
horse-whippin as soon as we make
camp an get some grub well have that
out 
  oh no i aint messed around the
chuckwagon if them raisins was found
in my bedroll somebody planted em
there as far as that goes mebbe i dont
need to look very far to see who did it
arbos eyes glinted wickedly and he
snapped the twist of black hair out of his
eyes with the back of his hand he looked
like he was boiling mad he went through
the right motions but tott crovet could
see it was a show it was something that
was part of a plan to stir up a commotion
and keep these young texans in an up-
roar picking on yorey because he was
their ringleader
  youre a smart little snot-nose arbo
hang-tree trail

went on with calculated contempt cuttin
your fancy capers and makin big talk
about pullin out and takin the whole
damned crew with you if i didnt let up
you still got a lot to learn and it wont
take me long to learn you with a horse
whip ill see you later he popped the
last of the raisins into his mouth wiped
his fingers on his shirt and rode off
  yoreys face was white with rage i
dont like raisins he ranted why
should i snitch raisins
  if you stopped to think yorey tott
remarked you could put two and two
together and it might give you a notion
how that empty cartridge got into my
gun
  the buzzard yorey growled the
low-down buzzard
and if he put words into your mouth
about smcllin gunsmoke on my gun may-
be lies puttin notions into your head
about pullin oul it sounded that way
what would that get him
  i wouldnt jump too fast thats all
nobodys ever goin to put a whip to
me he swung suddenly and rode
around the edge of the herd probably to
let off steam to one of his young friends
he always talked too much and it oc-
curred to tott that he might talk himself
into a whipping
  tott rode into the dust again and tried
to make some plans of his own yorey
wouldnt try to block the hanging he
might sputter and fume but in the end he
would let it go through and settle with
his conscience by building up his hate
against the yankees convincing himself
by degrees he had done the right thing
on the other hand if he stirred up a big
row when kell arbo tried to put a whip
to him it might give tott the chance he
was looking for to make a break and clear
out it would be near dark there would
be good horses on the picket line if he
could manage to get himself a gun he
would have a good chance the only one
probably that would turn up before they
reached the tree the next day arbo
usually had the nolan boys and red um-
ley throw a circle around camp to look for
injun sign or whatever and they seldom
got back before dark sometimes much
later so old suggs and arbo himself
would be the only ones to give him trouble
suggs pulled far ahead to make camp
red umley and the nolan boys rode
off together to make their circle a half
hour later with evening shadows stretch-
ing horse and man to long stalking gaints
arbo signaled to halt yorey didnt come
back he was making talk with all his
friends here and there arbo didnt seem
lo	notice the herd trail broke by now
gave  trouble a pond of water with
tules around the edges gave them drink
tott saw arbo ride across a stretch of it
to make sure cattle wouldnt bog down
tott headed for camp speculating on his
chances of getting hold of suggs gun he
usually left it on the wagon seat when he
worked around the chuckwagon tott
circlcd the wagon climbed the wheel on
the off-side and looked in
  if youre lookin for my gun suggs
spoke up behind him ive got it here i
knowed youd be up to somethin i
knowed it the minute we spotted the tree
now get yourself tied to this rope
  how in hell can i tie myself up

  ill finish what you cant do this time
blue-nose youre goin to hang good
  here they come now tott said he
didnt look up but he heard hoofbeats
   taint either suggs muttered its
jo and it looks like shes got a bee in her
bonnet 
  jo andre hair streaming and anger
flashing in her eyes had the answer to
suggs question bub yorey and the
whole crew had caught fresh horses out
of the cawy and had pulled out i spoke
to bub she stated trying to keep her
voice down so she wouldnt disturb her
father but he wouldnt listen he said
we oould got along with the men we had
  an its all that damn buzzards
fault suggs growled pointing at tott
his eyes gleamed with bitter fire and he
suddenly left his pot and pans and got
busy making a noose using some new
rope he found he worked with savage
fury and it didnt take him long when he
was finished he stuck one end of it
through the iron loop at the end of the
wagon pole hoisted the pole in the air
bolstering it with the wagon tongue and
tied the loose end to a wheel if it busts
ill leave you choke to death he snarled
adding the whole list of pet names he had
accumulated for the cussed northerners
  jo andre tried to stop what he was do-
ing but he gave her a hard shove and
tott tried to add his warning suggs was
in the middle of a fit that had to run its
course he got a horse off the picket line
and loaded tott abroad like red umley
had done that night on the creek
  youve gone nuts suggs tott told
him
  its high time suggs shrilled back
walking the horse toward the pole
  stop it jo andre cried again stop
it suggs i-ill shoot
  suggs whipped out his gun and turned
wild as he was he might have used it on
her but tott crovet moved fast his
hands were tied behind him but his legs
were free and he swung out of the saddle
and caught suggs in the back with both
boots suggs lurched forward and went
down his gun blazing wildly tott landed
running and jumped him before he could
twist around he kicked suggs in the arm
and sent the gun flying then he put a
boot across suggs ock and held him
down like a snake under a pronged stick
jo andre got some rope and tied the old
fire-eaters legs wrapping it around like
a bandage from his ankles to his knees
when she was finished tott stepped back
shaky with relief and turned his back to
her so she could cut the ropes from his
hands suggs threshed and squirmed but
the wildness was running out of him a
long way off tott heard gunfire and
guessed what it was arbo had located
yorey and the crew and was in the middle
of a show-down with them seems as if
hell fetch some of them hack anyway
tott muttered
  go now jo begged please go be-
fore they get back
  their eyes met in sudden solemn under-
standing he put his hand on her arm and
held it there feeling her tremble his eyes
lighted with sudden joy and his lips
brushed her smooth cheek im coming
back he told her
  she shook her head bitterly dont
come back she whispered we cant
get past this bitter hate
  he didnt answer he scooped suggs
gun off the ground climbed the horse and
racked away
c sbie-ltaad yatjm
     kell arbo came back empty-
handed and he came alone those yaller
dogs he growled they heard us come
an laid an ambush they didnt give us
a chance poor ol red an the nolans
too shot down like dogs i dont know
what were goin to do now
  that damn blue-nose eot away too
suggs wailed i got mad clear through
an was goin to hang him to the wagon
pole but he broke away
  i helped him jo andre spoke up
with a defiant look at arbo
  i might a knowned you would try it
suggs muttered irritably
  yes you might
  you reckon the old man kin stand a
talkin to arbo spoke up we got to
settle what were goin to do
  come over here all of you cap
andre called
  kell arbo gave a long-winded talk
mentioning the incidents that led up to
hangtree trail

th fix they were in now the only thing
to do now he finally ended up is to get
outa here as fast as we cin git an save our
skins willie aint worth a hoot for any-
thing except wranglin horses suggs
cant ride and youre a sick man that
leaves jo and me and what the hell we cin
do with a herd i dont know
  cant we hire some riders-some-
where cap andre put in
  where
  in the end grudging and bitter cap
andre said what had to be said well
let everything go turn back well take
one wagon for suggs and me and a few
spare horses let the rest go
  godamighty suggs breathed now
that it was said that blasted blue-
nose
  lets put the blame where it belongs
andre said
  wheres that suggs demanded
  not on tott crovet
  he croaked cobb suggs insisted
  i doubt it cap andre stated bleakly
he turned to arbo i think you did
arbo and i think you brought us to this
for your own ends
  arbo whipped the twist of hair out of
his bulging eyes as if hed been shot in the
head for a second he was too stunned to
ay anything then he grabbed andre by
the shirt and opened up id kill you out
of hand for that kind of talk if you wasnt
a sick man aint i kept this outfit on the
move ever since cobb got croaked id
still keep it on the move if i had a crew
he stopped and swallowed his words and
a hurt look came to his face believe
me he went on it hurts after what ive
done i reckon you think the same of poor
red and the nolan boys
  oh stop it cap andre muttered
disgustedly
  arbos anger flared again and he sud-
denly slapped andre across the face
talk like that aint free he muttered
youll find that out
  jo andre struck out with the flat of her
hand and arbo cursed andre caught her
hand and pulled her back youve done
everything you can do arbo he said
  arbos eyes suddenly shifted toward
jo i wouldnt say that mister he
uted running his tongue along his cheek
hot ho
godamighty suggs breathed again
jo looked pale but her eyes shone with
contempt you killed cobb and took his
job so you could wreck this drive i dont
know why but-
  ill tell you why arbo blurted put-
ting away all his pretense i got that
herd right in my hand the whole works
an i cin scare up men to handle it all i
got to do is whistle sure i plugged cobb
and i had the whole thing set from there
on i hurrawed them slick-eared sprouts
of yours to death so theyd clear out
crovet took it on the run and hell keep
runnin till he gets clear into kansas
thats all right with me i dont give a
hoot if he hangs or not you were all so
damned busy hatin yankees you never
catched on what you were gettin into if
you want to blame somethin for the pickle
youre in you cin blame it to that now
you know and you cin be damned sorry
you do i wouldve let you ride off but i
cant do it now all at once he got to his
feet put two fingers in his mouth and
whistled shrilly
  in a few moments a man rode in he
said his name was jakes he was badly
scarred in the face probably from fire and
his lips were pulled awry by scar tissue
he wanted to know if they had a riding
job he said he was a top hand and had
worked cows all his life he mentioned
places he had worked and kell arbo let
him speak his piece in full then the
trailboss grinned and said you do all
right jakes but you cin quit the funnin
the cats outa the bag
  you dont say jakes remarked a
little disappointed hell
  this is the girl i mentioned arbo
said pointing to jo thats the old man
and this is suggs the cookie the yank
dug out
  jakes looked them over one by one
letting his eyes rest at last on jo admiring-
ly whatre you goin to do he asked
kell without shifting his glance
  arbo shrugged it aint the way i
wanted it but we git what we want the
crew cleared out and it maleea h aasy
pickin anyway
  yeah i seen em go jakes sam
  you go get the boys
  okey kell theyre off a piece and
itll take till mornin

 story western magazine
  yeah thats okay arbo agreed
  this girl jakes remarked coolly i
understand we split even on everything in
this sheebang thats how it is aint it
  well see arbo muttered
  muttering like a sick dog suggs moved
around kicking at tufts of grass jakes
eyed him with growing curiosity and
finally asked what he was up to
  im lookin for iny guns suggs
shrilled thats what im doin you
want to know any more
  yeah jakes answered spose you
tell me why for you want your gun
  so i cin blow your brains out thats
why suggs ranted
 here take one of mine jakes
offered and flung it down
  now now kell arbo put in mildly
  jakes held out his hand and arbo shut
up suggs made a lunge for the gun and
got it in his hand jakes let him go that
far then opened up and riddled poor
suggs from head to foot jo andre stared
in unbelieving horror cnp andre tried to
push up but sagged back helplessly again
  a faint grin touched jakes face he
puffed smoke off the tip of his gun and
shoved it back in its holster well he
said finally i spose i better git the
boys
  suggs went to his knees then on all
fours and finally flat on his face them
damn blue-noses he muttered them
damn-
  when jo andre reached him he was
dead
suggs had picked a good horse off the
picket line for tott crovet to ride it
was a go-er and sure-footed and tott
headed it in the direction he had heard the
shooting just before he left camp the
direction jo andre had said the crew of
young texans had taken if i was any-
where near smart be told himself id
head for kansas and let em drink their
own vinegar with suggs on the warpath
all ill get out of this is a hangrope the
minute i show my face back in camp but
i cant do anything else not till ive spoke
my piece to her he smiled ruefully in
the dark i guess a mans bound to
stick his head in a noose of one kind or
another
  he started worrying about the gunfire
he had heard if there had been a fight it
wasnt likely he could get the crew to
come back but if there had been some-
thing else and arbo was still on the prowl
he had to watch out he didnt run into him
and lose whatever chance he might have of
talking to yorey he slowed up finally
and used more caution but he didnt see
or hear any riders and in the end he
didnt have as far to go as he expected
reckless as usual the crew had built a rip-
roaring fire in a shallow wash and he rode
in on them without any attempt at con-
cealment yorey saw him first and started
talking before he got off his horse look
who preached me a sermon and then
grabbed a horse and ran he taunted
why didnt you go the other way
straight for kansas
  maybe i dont want kansas tott
sadi maybe i like you boys
  no reason for that yorey answered
tott looked puzzled i thought id
find half of you dead didnt you have a
fight with arbo  he lit out after you with
red umley and the nolans and i heard
gunfire
  we heard gunfire too but we werent
in it
  suggs hogtied me when i got back to
camp and then tried to hang me to th
wagon-pole all by his lonesome tott ex-
plained he did almost as good as you
did the first time
  youre too lucky
  lucky enough to go back and try
again
  like fun
  i am
  hells blind mice man youre really
askin for it
  im going back because i think it looks
too damned yellow not to with the
andres in the kind of a fix theyre in
yorey flushed and turned to the crew
another sermon cornin up boys hes
goin back to be noble and get liung and
fin supposed to go back and take a whup-
pin eh
  thats for you to say yorey but ill
tell you this much youll never live down
what youre up to now itll ride ahead
of you like a yellow flag from now till
doomsday
  oh quit your damned preachin
yorey growled you made me sick to my
hang-tree trail

stomach he made a gesture of disgust
with his hands
  im about through tott said i just
want to tell you this much-i dont have a
ramrod up my back and i never bragged
njueh about what a rip-roarin hell-
twistin country i come from like youre
so good at doin but im going back to a
hanging and youre skeedaddling from a
whipping add that up and when you get
an answer do what you damned please
with that he turned and rode off a pro-
fane mutter following him into the dark
  he climbed out of the wash at a place he
eouid see the fire and waited he heard
the sultry rise and fall of their talk but he
was too far off to bear what was aid one
of them made a long-winded speech to the
rest and almost got into a fight another
walked round and round the fire stopping
every once in a while to take a hard kick
at the embers there were eight of them
ah of them had fire and tott was sur-
prised their auguring didnt flare up into
a free-for-all fight yorey did some more
talking and when he was through every
one raised a hand then someone stamped
out the fire and tott was left to guess
what decision they had come to in all that
palaver
  a little later he heard the clatter of
hoofs oil stone and aw them climb out of
the wash grinning he rode toward them
and fell in beside yorey
  so you got an answer he remarked
  yeah damn you yorey growled rue-
fully we got an answer but i must say
i certainly didnt ever expect to see you
again
  i knew id see you tott said and let
out a soft chuckle
ea gatantp qi
      jakes got back to the camp by the
pond before dawn red umley the nolan
boys and four other hardcases were with
him jakes had told them the fun was up
and red umley claimed he knew from the
start something would go wrong with all
of kell arbos scheming hells thun-
derbolts kell you get started on some-
thin and a snake couldnt foller yore
tracks i dont hold wjth it
  saved us a fight anyway arbo
stated we got rid of the crew didnt
we theyre all green shorthorns but
dont ever get it in your noodle they
wouldnt put up a fight
  thats alright umley admitted but
you get so almighty fancy kell this last
twist of your got me dizzy claiming we
had a fight with em and me and the
nolans got plugged hell thats just like
somethin you read in a book
  when did you ever read a book
arbo muttered the idea of going after
the crew merely to make a show shooting
off some gun-powder and sending umley
and nolan to throw in with jakes while he
came back to report them killed in the
fight was sound it put an end to any
possibility of keeping on with the drive
the whole thing had worked out just the
way he planned except that somewhere
along the line cap andre had caught on to
what was happening and had to shoot off
his mouth about it if he had kept quiet
arbo would have let the old cuss and the
girl go still this way had its advantages

  jakes bunch were tough renegades and
had trailed the a bar a herd ever since it
crossed the red river this wag a deal
arbo had cooked up with them before the
drive started he had killed cobb know-
ing he would get the job of trailboss in his
stead the nightly scouting by red umley
and the nolans was a cover so they could
keep in touch with jakes and set the time
to strike arbo hated to see all this smooth
scheming go to waste but it wasnt as
though he had failed he still had the herd
in his hand and the only thing left to do
was to get rid of cap andre you do it
jakes he told the fire-scarred outlaw
im squeamish you know how it is
when you been with a man a while you
dont like to shoot him out of hand
  oh my goodness sakesl jakes re-
marked mockingly and shook his head
kill your own snakes arbo im thinkin
about the girl too
   i cant do it
  well put the old buzzard on a horse
and let him ride hell fall apart the first
jump
  yeah arbo said thoughtfully i
guess youre right
  give him a good kinky bueker
  that sounds all right jakes
  jakes laughed and arbo walked toward
andre red umley his mind on some-
thing to eat was puttering around the
chuckwagon cap andre shaking with
chill was still in his soogans jo sat beside
him her face tight with strain the morn-
ing mist like a shallow sea began to stir
uneasily lifting here and there in smoky
tendrils wind whispered it away and
when it had cleared nine riders showed up
along the edge of the pond jakes saw
them first and let out a yell arbo swung
pushed the hair out of his eyes and made
a rush for his horse roaring orders red
umley dropped a pan and climbed his
horse again the rest were still mounted
  looks like another one of your snakes
back-tracked umley muttered with a
loose-lipped grin
  get the buzzards arbo snarled cut
em down an kill em
tott crovet pulled up at the edge
of the pond yorey stopped beside him
both of them stared at the charging
riders and tott counted them off looks
like we aint welcome yorey muttered
  you run this yank were green
  a bullet slid past his ear and he ducked
then the renegade rustlers set their guns
on fire and snarling blasts of lead shook
the air somebody went down with a crash
near the edge of the pond the horse
spooked into the water and bogged down
tott crovet yelled and made a motion
with his hand spreading them out and
they took his word
  suggs gun wasnt a bad weapon tott
notched two riders before he had to re-
load the boggy ground shook under the
pounding hoofs and sent ripples across
the open pond the top crust strong
enough for a lone rider began to give
way under the hard pounding and tott
saw an animal break through and go
down on its nose the rider legged it out
of there but a bullet overtook him and
knocked him flat
dont go in there or the whole busi-
nessll sag out from under tott warned
  yorey was hit his arm hung limp and
he cussed at his left-handed clumsiness
but he gave tott a cool squint-eyed grin
that was as friendly and substantial as any
tott had ever seen
  why didnt you say this was cornin
up he asked
  i didnt know it tott told him
  you guess good anyway yorey
yorey said with another grin and meant
more than he said
  tott read half the meaning in his eyes
and relief flooded over him like a wave
this was the place he had been looking
for the place where roiled waters met and
mingled and settled again to quietude
here again although he had almost given
up hope of ever seeing it men with the
same steadfast resolution and the same
decencies stood shoulder to shoulder
against a common enemy here again
they had found their common heritage
  somebody yelped like a trampled dog
and tott looked back into a young
blanched face streaming blood yorey
cussed again and went that way tott
stalked into the tules on the trail of the
man who had fired the shot but he lost
him in the wild commotion the hard top
crust was cracked and broken where it had
been trampled and stood on end sharp as
shards of glass sleazy red mud lay be-
ilang-tree trail

neatli it tott passed a dead renegade
flies buzzing around his spattered face a
scattering of cattle spooked past and al-
most ran him down the main herd was
on the move but it wasnt a stampede and
they wouldnt go far tott heard a rifle-
fire and caught a glimpse of jo andre
near the chuckwagon taking long-range
shots at the churning renegades the tules
thinned oul and tott came to a halt
  kell arbo rode a big appaloosa the
white spots on its rump trailing down to
its hocks he had made a try at flanking
the crew  one side and was circling the
sump to sec if he could do any better from
the other tott fired a shot as he rode
past and took otf his hat the horse
spooked and swerved struck broken
ground and went clown arbo ran for
cover and tott headed that way flushing
muskrats as he went a bullet whispered
past him slashing reeds he made a fix
on the spot where it came from and closed
in but arbo was on the move tott
risked a peek over the top of the reeds
and saw the quivering trail arbo was
leaving behind him tott fired and pulled
a hard grunt out of the sweating trailboss
nesting red-winged birds made a wild
turmoil above them and fledglings
gawped from their nests as tott moved
past with his feeling for such things he
shifted his course to spare them a heavy-
winged tlumderpump rose ahead of him
and arbo fired at the thing before he real-
ized his mistake
  thats the wrong man arbo tott
called knowing the sound of his voice
would filter through the reeds and come
from all directions
  damn you arbo flared i know
ou
  that suits me arbo
  so youre the one hauled them buz-
zards back arbo rasped
  they came of their own accord arbo
and i rcckon they figure they couldntve
conic to a better place
  arbo short m patience in the first
place and suddenly convinced he knew
the exact spot where totts voice came
from leaped up and charged in his gun
flaming he was close but he wasnt close
enough tott waited it out and then came
up his gun blazed pointblank and arbo
lurched grabbing at the reeds grabbing
at thin air his legs wilting everjr tp he
took until he finally sagged to his knees
his mouth thrown wide open to suck in
air his eyes glazing the last thing he did
was to swipe that bothersome twist of hair
out of his eyes as if that would help him
to see then he crashed forward in a
dead heap
  tott crovet stood up in the sudden
silence and looked around
  i reckon that takes care of the whole
sheebang yorey yelled we cant find
nobody else to shoot at
  tott waved and headed for camp
the next day after a late start tott
crovet bub yorey and jo andre
stopped under the cottonwood tree that
suggs and yorey had crowed about
  good enough to hang anybody on
yorey remarked craning his neck at the
thick branches
  get at it then tott invited wryly
  yorey pursed his lips i dont know
how to make a hang-noose he muttered
regretfully maybe jos got the hang of
  jo andre shook her head and smiled a
soft gentle smile for both of them
  dont tell me we got to let it go past
again yorey grumbled
  tott grinned indulgently and let the
taunting words pass because be knew what
they were he knew bub yorey what
the young texan had showed him of him-
self during the fight at the pond would
seldom come to the surface again but it
was there and mocking words could never
change it in a pinch they stood together
all of them stood together a boy lay dead
in his grave by the pond to make it so the
others battered and maimed but tickled
with themselves none the less and tickled
with their yankee trailboss would speak
the words yorey spoke and try their old
tricks but they showed how they felt by
going after the herd as if it were their
own even cap andre took heart at the
sight and rode a gentle horse again hoard-
ing his strength so it would be enough to
see him through
this place under the tree was some-
thing special for them and all three felt it
a place where bruised pride could heal
and the wild flames of hate die out tott

weapons-
or weep
johnny tlghm had figured wrong
his hard-earned money branded
him a killer-and only his gun
could clear himi
then be was w bailing his
hone cutting into an
alley   
johnny tighe slammed off the
dun horse in front of the striped
barber pole he hopped up the
lioardwalk close-cut pete was inside
cutting hair a customer waited in a cor-
ner hi close-cut johnny said its
easy johnny tighe back after two years
there was a yell of pain as the barber
slipped and jammed his scissors into the
customers scalp easy johnny he
blurted out he stood there for a mo-
ment staring open-mouthed at the tall

man before him slowly he laid down the
scissors snatched at the marble-topped
work table came away opening a huge
razor the two customers stared scram-
bled to back against the wall
  close-cut whats eatin you
  the barber advanced slowly lafe
durham was my friend for twenty years
he held the razor out before him the
glint of steel no harder than the light in
his eyes im goin to carve you down
killer easy johnny was always too good
grab weapons-or weep

a name for you you were just plain
worthless then back-gunnin a man who
treated you like his own son
  johnny backed to the door a hurt look
in his gray eyes close-cut t just come
in to get a shave and a haircut so  could
look good when  get out to see lafe
and- he paused for a moment added
in a calmer voice and jeanne too
the barber inched forward his hand
clenched until the knuckles were white on
the handle of the razor i dont know
where you get the nerve to come back
you sneakin killer
  johnny found himself backing to the
boardwalk the turn of events was enough
to make any man retreat when a man
comes home after two years after two
years of proving to the wrorld that he is a
man-
  jist stand steady and close-cut
pack that razor
  johnny felt it prodding into his back
only the muzzle of a six-gun could be
round and hard like that and from the
quiet voice he knew it was sheriff ben
jenks slowly he turned the oldsters
bristly white mustache was the same as
ever but not his eyes he had never
seen such burning hate in any mans eyes
and it was ben jenks who taught him a
fast six-gun draw when he was just a kid
  i-i dont get this sheriff i dont
understand
  youll understand the sheriff rasped
out youll understand that you cant
gun the man who raised you like his own
son then cornin back after two years of
hidin out and actin like you cxpect the
fatted calf to be killed
  slowly it sank into johnnys mind that
lafe durham wras dead and that some-
how they thought he had done it auto-
matically his hand reached in the left shirt
pocket and dragged out a bag of makings
he rolled the cigaret without thinking be-
cause he was too numbed to think
jeanne he said shes still--
still runnin her daddys ranch the
sheriff said runnin it like a man like
a man you never was now im goin to
take that there hogleg of yours
  johnny knew then that he had to see
jeanne she would tell him she wouldnt
think first with a razor or six-gun he
had to have someone tell him
  sheriff give me two hours two hours
and ill come back
  ben jenks snorted thats what youll
get two hours in jail before we hang
you
  johnny lit the cigaret staring over the
flame into the oldsters face what jenks
had said seemed very likely he would
hang first and then theyd ask questions
he saw the sheriffs hand reaching for his
gun coming close to where his own hand
was it had to be now he stared out
over the sheriffs shoulder let his mouth
drop in apparent surprise for a second
jenks glanced away in that second
johnny clamped a range-hardened hand
on the oldsters wrist with all his
strength he twisted
  aw- gasped the oldster he swung
around the gun wide of its target he
thumbed hammer and lead crashed into
the doorjamb johnny brought a boot up
fast it slammed the gun nigh into the
air and then the youngster was outside
the door back against the wall six-gun
leveled at the barber and sheriff he felt
back for the hitchrope untied it sudden-
ly he was vaulting into saddle he saw
ben jenks scoop up his six-gun then he
was wheeling his horse cutting into the
alley a minute later he pounded across
hangdog creek and up through the little
woods
the woods had looked like paradise
when he rode down from the bluff
that afternoon all going red and gold
with autumn frosts he remembered the
time-he and jeanne had been riding into
town and all of a sudden hed been over-
come with the way the sunlight filtered
through her hair and made it seem alive
and golden hed hooked an arm out and
pulled her to him the horses seemed to
understand and they closed up he kissed
her then and for a second she answered
the kiss then she was racing her pony
through the little woods and lie pounded
after her laughing and shouting not
catching her until they reached town
thats the kind of harum-scarum easy
johnny tighe was in those days
  he slapped the dun on the rump and
they cut up over bull bluff through into
the grasslands that fringed the axe head
the axe head was the ridge that ran

 story western magazine
through and up to the grasslands to the
north he was breathless when he got to
the top all that had happened to him in
rocksalt was forgotten for the moment
for big eight lay beyond axe head
  the grasslands made a two-mile sweep
down to the ranchhouse glossy green
tinged with brown from the frosts they
rolled gently to the right clear to the
northern arm of the axe head to the
south they were lost in the distance and
in the lowest part where the little jalco
river wound was the windbreak of cot-
tonwoods sprawling across the stream
there were barns and log corrals and the
painted whiteness of the ranchhouse
johnny felt something tug inside of him
when he looked down there he realized
that he hadnt come back just to show
lafe durham that he was a man hed
come back to the big eight
  he thought of the time when he left
ever since his father died lafe had raised
him like his own son right along with
lafes daughter jeanne they first
climbed on a horse together he and
jeanne they learned to rope and cut out
calves to spot market-size steers and tell
weights at a glance lafe promised that
someday his daughter and adopted son
would get equal shares in big eight it
was plain too that he hoped they wouldnt
split it he wanted them to marry when
they came of age he had made that
plain
  it was when johnny took to gambling
that lafe really got mad he had been
content to put up with johnnys crazy kid
tricks johnny remembered the night lafe
had come into the rocksalt saloon and
found him owing ace pracket three hun-
dred -dollars besides having lost his gold
watch and horn-handled six-gun before
everybody lafe blew off tuh think i
raised a younker fer this he yelled he
yelled some more too and johnny yelled
back he remembered shouting ill even
up for this then he was gone into the
night he hit the saddle and rode rode
straight south at first he just tried to
remember what caused the argument and
what happened during it words like
worthless pup he vowed then to erase
the mark hed go out and make his own
way then hed come back and show the
oldster hed show him ten one-hundred
dollar bills show lafe that he needed no
help from anyone
  and he had come back to this
  johnny headed the pony down the
slope a movement caught his eye two
riders up along the axe head he turned
the pony back into some horse-high brush
to watch they were trotting slowly sud-
denly he recognized the left-hand rider
golden hair flying in the wind sitting the
horse as though she were part of it
jeanne johnny wheeled his pony headed
straight for them he saw jeannes blue
eyes then large and lustrous and staring
at him as though he were a ghost with a
shock he recognized the other rider mel
koles a cowhand of lafes when he
left a big man though not as tall as
johnny with black hair and a black
mustache a handsome man except for
the thin lips they were just the outward
things that johnny didnt like about mel
kole others were the way he kow-towed
to lafe and the soft oily words he always
had for jeanne
  he spun his pony to a stop before
them johnny the girl cried johnny
youve come back
  he tried to grin at her there was too
much emotion pent up in him ive come
back he said and he rasped out and
found my name smeared with mud
  he has a lot of nerve mel koles
said a killer coming back to the scene
of the crime
  johnny lowered his head a little you
go run and tell the sheriff im here kole
kole glowered at him lips a hard thin
line
  johnny shot a glance at jeanne he
saw a tear in her eye you dont be-
lieve i did it do you jeanne
  she sobbed slowly she brought her
chin up and looked him straight in the eye
maybe you were a crazy youngster and
even worthless like dad said but i could
never believe you killed him she sobbed
again the evidence though running
away the night he was killed and after
everybody heard the argument and you
saying youd get even-
  johnny knew then how much he loved
her his eyes were glued on her wet ones
suddenly he caught a glimpse of mel
kole a big hand streaking for gunbutt
johnny whirled but made no move for his
grab weapons-or weep

own gun he stared into the mans face
leave it kole his eyes blazed with
anger he rasped out flatly you arent
mail enough to gun me
  koles hand stopped on gunbutt he
measured his chances glancing at john-
nys gun at his rawboned hand resting
easily on the saddle horn he blinked and
his breath wheezed out
  kole get out of here unless youre
ready to draw but i say youre too yel-
low for that his face wore an expression
of contempt
  koles eyes flicked up and down him
youll hang by tonight boy he growled
he cut his horse viciously to the left rak-
ing spurs into its flanks johnny watched
him looking back over his shoulder as
though he expected a slug to come whin-
ing at him and johnny remembered that
mel kole had one of the fastest draws he
had ever seen and yet he had been afraid
to use it plainly johnny tighes return
had shaken him badly
  why is he still here jeanne
  hes my foreman her chin was up
and her eyes showed the stubbornness old
lafe used to have you own half the
ranch by dads will but im running it
at present and ill hire whoever i please
he stared at her moved his horse clos-
er do you believe i killed your dad
her eyes dropped since dads death
ive been so alone johnny with every-
one saying you were always no good i-
i- her voice trailed off whereve
you been johnny
  california mexico ive spent two
years proving im not what lafe thought
i was he pulled a money belt out from
under his shirt drew out ten one-hundred
dollar bills these were to show lafe
his voice went bitter i suppose that
showing them now will look like theyre
stolen easy johnny tighe drygulcher
she sat still looking at him and the tear
was still in her eye
  so all of a sudden he rasped ive
got to prove i didnt kill lafe when did
it happen jeanne
  the night you left
  two years after the killing ive got to
prove i didnt do it  and with a hangrope
ridin my backtrail he moved his horse
over close to her and his voice softened
ii you said you believed in me
jeanne- he looked straight into her
eyes
  she dodged his glance then she
started hoofs were rattapanning up the
axe head the sheriff johnny three
or four men they must have met mel
kole
  johnny didnt look toward them i
wont go until you tell me jeanne
  her eyes went wide with terror
theyre coming two hundred yards
youve got to go
  do you believe in me he sat his
horse quietly back turned to the galloping
horsemen
  her eyes darted around yes yes
i believe in you-now go
  johnny grinned he swung an arm
around her pulled her to him he kissed
her hard as he drew his face away he
said ill be back jeanne then sud-
denly he was spurring along the axe
head waving back to her mel kole sent
two shots burning after him but easy
johnny had cut out into the brush he
knew the posse had ridden hard his
horse was rested and the climb up the
axe head should put them behind he
glanced back saw sheriff ben jenks
kole and two others kole seemed to be
holding his horse back johnny grinned
koles horse was the freshest but he was
afraid to lead the others by too much he
reached a heavy growth of jack-pines
slashed the pony through them then he
stopped to breathe the horse let them
tire their mounts he thought when they
had worked over his trail a while he could
cut them out and lead them off again he
sat there quietly rolled a quirly he told
himself theyd have a job catching easy
johnny tighe
they came close later that afternoon
he gave them a run his jack-pines
again and lost them when dark came
they had to give up johnny sat on a cleft
of rock up on the rim of the axe head
smoking below he could see a glimmer
of light at the ranchhouse inside he was
aching to see jeanne for one thing
while she said she believed in him it had
been hurried anything to make him
leave but that meant she didnt want him
killed one small comfort anyway
  he knew that no amount of earnest
talking would rally convince her talking

 story western magazine
about it wouldnt convince anybody he
had to find who murdered lafe and the
trail was two years old
  but there he was bogged down he
knew that lafe was killed the same night
he left but no more than that maybe
the oldster had been carrying a sizeable
cash wad maybe someone had slipped out
of lafes past and done a job of vengence
at any rate the murder was timed well
to put the blame on easy johnny tighe
  he had to find out and jeanne was
the only person he could trust he
dragged deep on his cigaret crushed it out
on his bootheel he hopped on his horse
and in a minute the pony was plodding
down through the deep valley grass
  when he came close he spotted a light
in the kitchen figuring on a possible
trap he ran his horse into the far corral
then slipped quietly around to the kitchen
window inside he saw jeanne standing
against the far wall her arms folded her
brow was puckered and she was talking
fast to the four men seated at the kitchen
table jenks kole and two men johnny
didnt know the window was closed and
all he could get was the murmur of voices
at length the four men got up and left the
ldtchen johnnv slunk back in the bushes
alongside the nouse he watched them
climb into the saddle and head off toward
town
   when they were out of sight he tapped
on the kitchen window he saw jeanne
stiffen then she recovered and pointed
toward the front door johnny hurried
around and into the house he met her
in the dark hallway
  think they might come back he
said
  she shook her head not now wed
bet -stay in the dark though theyve
gone to town to round up a big posse
going to comb the range tor you
  johnny shoved back the emotion that
made him want to put his arms around
her with difficulty he managed to re-
member that he was in immediate danger
he said jeanne where was mel kole
the night lafe was killed
  she frowned why he was with dad
he saw- she stopped suddenly broke
into hurried words he says he saw you
pull your horn-handled gun and shoot
dad- he fised at you but you were gone
  it hit johnny hard his fists knotted
he saw it he almost shouted that
means he did it jeanne he paced hur-
riedly up and down the hall
  she turned to him grabbed his shirt
but johnny hes been such a good fore-
man so nice to me even though we
arent making much money
  he stopped not making money
listen ive been away in california and
mexico but i know what cattle prices
have been
  yes prices have been good but the
calf-drop seemed to be low and-
  and kole has been rustling your
cattle he killed lafe when he saw i could
be blamed for it that was so he would
have a free hand with the place ill bet he
has a wad of cash tucked away he paced
the floor again muttering to himself he
was certain that kole had done it and he
knew why but that only confirmed his
suspicions he was a hunted man his
only evidence was that kole had claimed
he saw easy johnny tighe kill the ranch-
er and because he hadnt done it he
knew that kole was the killer but who
would listen to him 
  the sheriff jeanne said ben jenks
is a fair man if i talked to him-
  johnny shook his head theres only
one way got to prove that kole did it
he hiked up his gunbelt im goin to
town jeanne ive got a hunch that kole
has overplayed his hand he hurried to-
ward the door jeanne grabbed his arm
johnny if they catch you-
  he grinned at her threw an arm
around her shoulders dont worry he
kissed her quickly then ran to the door
she stood staring after him the way he
did that-she couldnt explain it but there
was something about the old easy johnny
tighe that would never change
  he got a fresh pony from the corral and
headed for town he rode hard and knots
of muscles worked up in his shoulders he
resolved one thing that if he couldnt
bring mel kole to justice kole would still
ey for killing lafe durham but ahead
j a town full of hostile people men who
would shoot him on sight
   he left his horse as he swung up in back
of rocksalts low frame buildings he
walked silently out to the mouth of an
alley glanced both ways down the street
grab weapons-or weep

there was a bunch of horses tied in front
of the sheriffs office others at the rock-
salt saloon hitch-rail he thought of the
last time he was at the saloon when ace
pracket had cleaned him of every cent
taken his watch and gun as well he
glanced over at close-cut petes barber
shop his eyes lit up the gray kole had
been riding that afternoon was tied in
front he hurried over to the barbershops
side window to make sure
  somebody was getting into ilic barbers
chair hut close-cut was standing in the
way the barber moved and johnny saw
mcl roles black hair as he laid back in
the chair close-cut was putting towels on
his face
that was enough johnny slipped
around to the front door stepped in-
side the barber didnt look up from the
wash stand it gave johnny a chance to
glance around the shop was empty
koles face was covered with towels
johnny drew his gun he gulped a couple
of times it was a thin long hand he was
playing lie raised his voice to a high
pitch
   kin yuh cut a old fellers beard close-
cut
  the barber turned his mouth dropping
open for once his slicked-down hair
seemed rumpled or maybe it was the
wav his face was working kole hidden
under the steaming cloths didnt seem to
notice anything
  ill just set my old bones down over
here close-cut you just scrape that
there fellers beard
  the barber wrung out some hot cloths
he eyed the open gun barrel that stared at
him johnny counted on his being shocked
into silence for a few minutes before he
started grabbing razors but at any time
the barber might start yelling for the
sheriff or johnnys voice might crack
back down to normal and kole would
start throwing off hot towels and reach
for his gun
  see yuh got mel kole under them
towels close-cut mel reckon youll be a
big help in swingin that there tighe
killer after all you seed him kill old
lafe you was ridin back to the ranch
with lafe that night wasnt yuh mel

under the cloths i saw him i turned
around just as he was pullin that horn-
handled colt of his i saw him shoot old
lafe in the back he got away from

in the doorway his silver star glittering in
the lamplight for a moment he didnt
notice johnny posses ready mel
whenever yuh get prettied up like- his
voice broke off when he saw the man he
was after sitting in a chair and leveling a
six-gun at him
  johnny lost his voice for a moment
then he gripped gunbutt savagely he
knew there were only seconds to make his
play sheriff he said in the high-
pitched oldsters voice he had been using
you never got all the facts straight on

artists of the
 diamond hitch 
by j w
the expert of the diamond hitch
and the mule pack train had an es-
sentially important part to play in
the transportation of supplies machinery
and every conceivable thing necessary to
make available the resources of the vast
mountainous regions of the west to man
where wagons couldnt go the diamond-
hitch artist and the pack mule took over
  in the mountain sections of northern
california and southern oregon alone
there were thousands of pack mules in use
during the sixties seventies and early
eighties carrying their burdens to the
isolated homesteaders ranches and min-
ing camps throughout a vast region
there were no wagon road no bridges
across the rivers just narrow often dan-
gerous trails zigzagging back and forth
across mountains stringing along steep
cliffs or crossing and recrossing some
stream following always the line of least
resistance
  far-seeing merchants placed stores at
convenient locations and equipped pack
trains of from thirty to  or more mules
-to pack everything from food dynamite
and kegs of whiskey to quartz mill ma-
chinery saw mill parts and hydraulic
monitors a first class outfit was supposed
to average  pounds to the animal
these mules were carefully picked-usu-
ally of the block type and weighing
around  to  pounds they had to
be good walkers
  a packer just had to be good or he
was no good at all he had to be quick
active strong and use good judgment
everything about handling freight was
systematized packages of ordinary freight
would be lashed together in side packs of
around  pounds each and the cargo
conveniently arranged for rapid work in
loading three good men and a bell boy
could handle a train of around  to 
animals

irving
  the work of packing begun the train
would have to be loaded and moving
within an hour you couldnt keep an ani-
mal standing around for two or three
hours with a  pound pack on his back
packers had to be expert saddlers a dirty
blanket or an overlooked crease could
cause a saddle sore each saddle tree waj
adjusted to fit the individual animal a
pack had to balance perfectly else it might
turn and pile the pack and animal down
in some canyon
  ever good outfit had reserved a few
of the most intelligent and strongest ani-
mals for top packs these top packs
were single pieces of machinery stoves
trunks or what-not too heavy for side
packs often a section of a stamp mill
mortar or an hydraulic monitor would
weigh  pounds or better
  in the handling of such pieces pack
train owners often demanded full insur-
ance on the value of the animal before they
would touch them to handle these top
packs a piece of wood would be lashed
on each side of the saddle and even with
the top of the tree forks this made a
base for the pack to rest on an abso-
lutely expert job had to be done on a
heavy top pack perfect balance was im-
perative and the job had to be done fast
gold mines had a habit of locating them-
selves in the most inaccessible regions
and in such impossible places most of such
packs had to go
  a good pack outfit was well trained
undesirable animals were soon weeded
out mules for some unexplainable reason
will follow a gray mare to hell and back
the custom was to put a bell on the mare
and ride her in the lead the mules soon
got used to the sound of the bell and would
follow as long as they could hear it at
night when the animals were turned loose
to gaze they seldom strayed beyond the
sound of the bell in the morning the
artists of the diamond hitch

trick was to catch the mare and the mules
would follow her to camp
  saddles in camp were placed in a semi-
circle and while the bell boy was
cooking breakfast the gray mare would
be led to the near end of the semi-
circle on the outside each mule would
crowd in along-side heads over the sad-
dles the packer from the inside of the
semi-circle would place slip halters on the
mules heads they would then be tied to-
gether for saddling with breakfast over
the packing starts two men on the
near side deftly swing up the 
pound side pack to rest on tree forks of
the saddle the man on the off side
swings a loop around it pulls it over on
his own side and steadies it the end of
the sling rope is thrown over and tied
from the near side walk him says
the boss the mule is led a few steps to
see that the pack is balanced
  now comes the art of throwing the
famous diamond hitch the lash rope
seems almost a living thing-no lost mo-
tion every move counts with the real
diamond-hitch artist the rope fairly sings
a few incredibly quick movements and
the thing is done in less than a minute-
the pack securely lashed to all four comers
of the pack saddle and under the animals
belly when finished a diamond shaped
design shows in the rope on top of the
pack-hence the diamond hitch in less
than an hour the packing is done the bell
boy has packed his kitchen and is on
the trail riding the mare the loaded train
is on its way around  miles was con-
sidered a day under heavy packs
  a mule is a most intelligent pack animal
he may be full up to the neck with cus-
sedness he may kick your eyebrows
off but he knows how to take care of
himself-and does you cant get him on
a dangerous bridge or in miry ground
if he cant go around or jump a danger-
ous place he just wont go at all he will
travel a narrow dizzy trail around some
almost perpendicular cliff or canyon wall
but he must have clearance for his pack
just a few inches clearance is enough in
order that he can keep his pack from
striking an obstruction and hurtling him
and his pack to destruction a good boss
packer always looked out for this and
never put his loaded train on a trail unless
he was sure of sufficient clearance for his
packs
  pack trains in the days of the early
west were used to pack flume and build-
ing lumber also mining timbers pack-
ing boards  to  feet in length was no
great shakes at all for packing lum-
ber racks were suspended on either side
of the saddle from the tree forks
  wooden pins were adjusted to rest the
lumber on with one-inch lumber the
front ends were tied together a loop
was slung over the rear ends and drawn
tight then again would come the inevi-
table diamond hitch the load would re-
semble an inverted row boat over the
deck of the mule the intelligence of the
mules in carrying lumber through rough
and broken country was nothing short of
amazing
  with perhaps only a width of  to 
inches for his hoofs and in steep country
he had no way to recover from a jar he
would be just a gone duck but here is
where the mule really used his intelli-
gence to save himself if in a tight place
where there would be danger of the lum-
ber striking an obstruction close to the
trail he would keep his eyes peeled
with greatest of care he would swing the
end clear and ease himself around the
dangerous spot keeping as close as safety
would permit to the outer edge of the trail
and in no case would he get careless in
a situation dangerous to himself
  he might for some reason of pure un-
adulterated cussedness try to rub off his
pack by going between two trees but it
had to be on level ground and involve
no danger to his personal safety  to climb
a steep grade with a heavy top pack re-
quired some careful work too he must
walk steady head well down lest the
pack pull him over backwards a horse
might throw up his head to look at the
scenery but never a mule he is all for
safety first
  the large mule pack trains with their
highly skilled diamond hitch artists be-
long to a past and heroic era but they as
the wagon trains had their important
part in blazing the way for the up to date
methods of transit that the west now
enjoys
santa claus of
bitter creek
by a c
abbott
christmas eve on the bitter
creek range found a grim-lipped
stranger loping steadily through
the deepening snow toward hill city-and
escape he was a tall man under thirty
with dark hungry eyes burning out of a
lean brown face
  rounding a sharp corner in the trail
the rangy black mare almost knocked
down a small figure plodding determined-
ly through the drifts
  hi there bud called the rider his
chrhtmas eve is no time to be out
banting strays-unless youre a stray
yourself   

santa claus of bitter crbek

hand flashing out of his pocket to quiet the
startled mare
  hi there yourself chirped back a
sassy little voice and the kid endeavoring
to get out of the trail sat down suddenly
in a huge drift
  kinda cold settin aint it inquired
the cowpuncher innocently as he leaned
out of the saddle to lift the five-year-old
up behind him the cowpunchers horse
molly objected to the strange feeling of a
person behind the saddle and started down
the trail sideways snorting her protest
  looky here now drawled the rider
reprovingly aint you got no social in-
stincts
  finally persuading her that everything
was all right he turned in the saddle to
view his new found traveling companion
a chubby cold-reddened face and bright
blue eyes shone at him from a bundle of
dark heavy clothing and the cowpuncher
grinned
  where you headin bud he asked
  im goin to town to get my mom a
christmas present came the prompt an-
swer
  well ill be darned muttered the
rider a dream he had buried six years
ago rose out of the depths to turn his
voice husky
  christmas eves kinda late for shop-
pin aint it
  yep but i just got the money for help-
in old man benson find his spotted calf
sure was a job in all this snow but he
gave me a dime and  gotta get mom
somethin good
  you bet the puncher murmured soft-
ly somethin grand for a fellas mom
he squinted suddenly as he realized that
his own son would have been not much
bigger than this
  you headin for town mister the
boy asked
  you bet
  whatcha gonna do
  get plastered came the instant re-
sponse
  get what the kid asked blankly
   pie-eyed stinkaroo 
  the kid only looked more puzzled at
each word the rider fumbled around for
another term found none and shrugged
helplessly
  whats all them the kid asked with
grave interet hi eye were curious
  never mind drawled the cowpunch-
er youll probly read about it in the
paper next week
  but the kid couldnt never mind
plastered he said again like as if
you was gonna get kalsomined 
  the punchers laugh rolled out into the
snowflakes ill probly get kalsomined
too he said
  what for
  the puncher abruptly faced ahead and
looked studiously at mollys short ears
thats a long story bud he said curtly
   tell me insisted the kid
  the man swore under his breath how
could he tell a button like this about six
years of running from christmas of being
afraid to greet the yuletide without a bot-
tle in his hand and a blurred hilarity in
his eye he hated christmas he hated
himself for running from it but he couldnt
help it he could still see that little cabin
snug and comfortable with cretonne cur-
tains at the windows and a baby bed that
was never used his wife had gone that
night-christmas eve   
  he had buried her and then had pulled
out leaving the ranch in the care of a re-
liable foreman he had been wandering
aimlessly ever since
  now from under a wide-brimmed
snow-filled hat he looked at the large aoftly
falling snowflakes at the pines patiently
holding out arms already heavily laden
he swore again and his voice was strained
aint this snow purty
  yeah its purty said the kid impa-
tiently but why you gonna get all them
things you gonna give em to some-
body
  i-aint got nobody to give em to
bud
  the man rode with easy relaxation the
turned-up collar of his heavy mackinaw
allowing only a glimpse of his bright scarf
to peep through his chin was clean shav-
en and his hands were shoved deep into his
pockets leaving the reins draped loosely
over the saddle horn he looked the pic-
ture of carefree deviltry but there was in
his voice a loneliness that stopped even
the kids questioning
   yeah the little fellow said slowly it
sure is purty
  you know mused the puncher i

 story western magazine
havent done any christmas shoppin for
a long time what do you say-
  he hesitated maybe this independent
young man didnt want any help he
would have friends in town maybe rela-
tives  and a drifting whiskey-drinking
cowpuncher had better keep on drifting
so tne man kept his pockets and his mind
on a drink while molly loped on toward
town
ttill city with all its excited occu-
pants its two stores and its three
saloons was soon reached the rider in-
quired the way to the livery stable and
then offered to let his new friend off at the
store
  the little fellow hesitated his chubby
fists tight in the back of the mans coat
finally he suggested ill help you put
your horse up if youll help me get moms
present i dont know just what a feller
ought to get his mom
  the mans heart leaped but he kept his
voice casual thats a fair enough bar-
gain pardner what say we get molly
here a box of sugar lumps for her christ-
mas present shes an awful old beggar
but i promised to get her somethin
sure said the youngster eagerly
ill hold her while you get it
  the puncher knew very well that the
mare would stand until she starved to
death waiting for him but he didnt let the
kid know this he strode heavily into the
bustling store and while he was making
his purchase he covertly watched the boy
he was such a little squirt his heavy
clothes looming black in the softness of
the snow he gripped the reins in a tight
fist looking up at the towering horse with
wide-eyed confidence and he had asked
the man for help
  suddenly the rider grinned broadly
his booted foot began to tap against the
rough board floor and a christmas spirit
he had thought long dead came to life and
ran away with him
  when molly had been shown to her
hotel served in her room and permitted
to see and sample her christmas present
the two pilgrims went out to see what
could be done for mom-
  happy confusion was everywhere
horses and buckboards lined the street
and merry christmas filled the air
pink-cheeked women hurried in and out
of the stores while red-nosed cowpunchers
lounged in and out of the saloons the
rider stared for a moment at a noisy group
going into macs place he ran a tongue
around his dry lips
  the enthusiastic boy had been babbling
constantly about different tilings he might
get asking questions that went un-
answered suddenly the cowpuncher
smiled thinking of the dime he shoved
the kid into the big general store drawling
softly looks to me like you got one of
those champagne appetites and a beer
pocketbook
  they had time to look over everything
in the store before old mike gabby with
his gray handle-bar mustache and bald
head came to wait orl them the boy
pointed to a beautiful hand-made cedar
chest and asked mike how much it was
  thatll only cost you a nickel the
rider spoke up glaring fiercely at the
startled old man behind the counter
  old mikes mouth popped wide as he
stared at the young stranger and then
slowly a grin touched the far corners of
his eyes he fumbled for his suspenders
hooked his thumbs comfortably and began
rocking back and forth on age-bowed
legs
  yep thats right he boomed heartily
just a nickel things shore have come
down in price lately
  that leaves you a nickel bud
drawled the serious cowpuncher what
elsell you have
  well lessee the kid murmured
puckering his brows in thoughtful satis-
faction mom and me cut a tree yester-
day but we havent got nothin to put on
it maybe i could get some of those little
dodaddies you know he added confi-
dentally women like to have things
purty
  what about your dad bud the
rider questioned helpfully are you
gonna get him somethin
  you oughta have some candy and
nuts and stuff spoke up mike hastily
giving the nonplussed cowpuncher a hard
shove toward the candy counter when
the young man recovered his balance
mike was beside him whispering hoarsely
dads dead got bad hurt in the slide
last year they used up every cent they
santa claus of bitter creek
-
had tryin to save him but he didnt make
it his keen old eyes rested briefly on
the strangers face
  ahuh the rider shifted his weight
to one long leg deftly tipped his hat
down over his eyes and let his hand fall
to mikes stooping shoulder i reckon
he said gravely that well have a pennys
worth of candy about five or ten pounds
mixed be sure to give us some of all
kinds and well have another pennys
worth of mixed nuts about the same
amount and well have a couple dozen
oranges and some bananas if you got
em and a big ikx of those fancy
chocolates for mom huh bud  and a
gob of pop corn and cranberries to string
for the tree and well take a pennys
worth of them trinkets and candles and
that gold and silver braid stuff and some
of those bells that about finishes the
dime bud is there anythin else you
want 
  gosh no the little fellow gasped
with shining eyes how we gonna get
all this home
  jim baileys up the street a ways with
his buckboard mike suggested trying
vainly to keep his exultation from show-
ing hell take you home
  big hearty jim bailey was more than
glad to take the kid home his eyes were
brightly astonished when he saw the cedar
chest and he looked quickly at the cow-
puncher that individual flushed deeply
and only said give me a hand here
gosh the kid squealed ill bet
mom doesnt know you can get all this
much stuff for a dime
  ill bet you wouldnt either if youd
ever seen a dime before said jim bailey
quizzically and besides that ill bet
your mother doesnt even know where
you are we better get a-kitin
  when the kid and his dimes worth of
purchases were started home the puncher
turned back into the store old mike met
him at the door and began boy i could
hug-
  shut up dad and come wait on me
the rider interrupted mildly i aint
through with my christmas shoppin yet
i got somethin here said mike run-
ning a guilty eye over his store thats
awful good for your christmas spirit
he pulled a bottle from under the ooun-
ter and shoved it across the puncher
reached out and again his tongue slid
around his lips then he shook his head
and grinned
  thanks mike but i aint got time-
yet i better wait till i get everythin else
done and then go at it slow and thorough
after an hour of careful and much-
debated selection the rider went out
in the gathering dusk after his horse
on his return he cut a length of his rope
and took it into the store leaving molly
standing indignantly out in front still
chomping a clump of good hay
  here he said we can strap it on
with this you bring the sled and ill take
the pack
  back out with molly who was straining
her neck to seewhat was going on old
mike set the big shiny flyer sled down
in the snow and turned to help with the
huge bundle after much planning and
rearranging they got it tied securely on
the sled then the puncher fastening the
end of hi shortened lariat onto the sled
as a tow rope took a couple of dallies
j
 story western magazine
around the saddle horn and swung up
  mike advanced and placed an affec-
tionate hand on the riders knee
  boy i dont know what to say to
you he stammered youve got enough
stuff to last a family of ten for a year all
kinds of clothes toys galore a little saddle
for the kid and every book and fancy
knick-knack i had for his mother theyre
the finest kind of folks and theyve sure
had tough luck i wish i could thank you
but i-
  aw lay off dad protested the em-
barrassed puncher if id known you
were gonna act like this id of gagged
you
mike had to say something though so
he mumbled thats a fine lookin horse
  the puncher settled back with a relieved
erin only female i ever found he
drawled who dont talk back
  following the directions given him the
rider jogged reluctantly past the humming
saloon and was soon out of town and 
his way to the little cabin moll stepped
high and wide with a cautious eye always
on that top-heavy bundle following her
  first time i ever played santy claus
the rider muttered then to molly
reckon youll have lu sprout a pair of
horns and change your name to blitzen
and ill have to cultivate a crop of
whiskers well have to get us a job ridin
line though or santys goin broke and
im darn near starved
  the cabin in the little clearing looked
like a dolls house under its load of snow
its windows like tiny lamps in the dark-
ness it was built neatly on a slope with
steps and a small landing before the plank
door
  the cowpuncher breathed more easily
when he decided that the dogs if there
were any were in the house dismounting
and stepping cautiously up to the landing
he peeped in to find the boy and his fair-
haired mother hilariously decorating the
little tree in the corner the fireplace was
glowing lustily the cedar chest was still
in the center of the floor on a table with-
in reach of the tree were heaping dishes
of candy nuts and fruit and a dog was
sitting beside the table looking expectantly
from the exuberant couple to the high-
piled dishes
  the man on the outside suddenly choked
over an obstruction in his throat this
might have been his own home if- he
cursed savagely as he felt his emotions
getting out of control and he turned blind-
ly toward molly with only one idea in
mind-leave his bundle at the door and
ride
  he lunged for the steps the second of
which gave under his weight with a
screeching rend he felt himself falling
and clawed vainly for support then he
was upside down in the drift at the
bottom
  the dog set forth a furious barking
the kid yelled the woman screamed
and poor molly stiff-legged and terrified
practically sat down  the bundle of
toys
  the door flew open and the woman
the kid and the dog bounded out in a
single motion in the full light of the door
the cowpuncher struggled to a sitting
position found his hat and jammed it
viciously on his head
  that damn step he blurted needs
fixing
  yes the woman replied quietly
smothering a giggle i know
  the cowpuncher knew too they
needed a man around a homestead he
got to his feet and somehow found the
grin he had lost so abruptly in the snow-
drift
  i brought a little somethin for the
kid he drawled with a little careless
gesture
  he wasnt quite sure how it happened
but presently he found himself sitting in
the warm cabin eating a piece of candy
and no longer wishing he had time to get
drunk when the bundle was opened the
woman failed utterly to find the words to
thank him she just looked at him for a
long time
  the puncher guessed that some of his
loneliness was sticking out around the
edges because she said unexpectedly
spend christmas with us
  he sailed his hat across the room where
it settled with a permanent-looking
dangle on the deer horns above the cabin
door
  ill fix that step in the mornin he
grinned

spilled over to her voice bill knight tried
to ignore that hurt tried not to see it

about these things

dads hay and grain business you wont
see what this means to me you wont
understand will you
  there was sudden passion in her voice
i understand bill too well in dodge
it will be only a bigger a worse version of
the last two years here in watergap the
days and nights of horror as you became
known as bill knight marshal of water-
gap and the gunmen wanting to add you
to the notches on their guns the nights
i lay cold with terror listening for the
shots and the sound of feet someone
coming to tell me you were dead or had
added another notch to your gun
marie i- his hands lifted toward
her again then stopped
  she lifted her head and was looking at
him suddenly steadily in the deepening
twilight he saw the finality in her eyes
  bill she said if you go with outler
to dodge its over between us i cant
live like that
  his lips opened to speak a plea there
ready then they closed tightly and his
dropping hands made a hopeless gesture
  goodbye bill she whispered and
was running into the house
  bill knight turned downtown his hand
moving in a half understood gesture to
the spot on his vest where the marshals
tar had hung for two years he had
turned it in today and his valise was
packed and ready in the watergap hotel
his stride lengthened kane outler would
be arriving at the hotel in a few more
minutes he would stay there tonight and
tomorrow embark for dodge and bill
knight would be with him
  somehow bill did not feel the awe he
had expected as he watched kane outler
step down from the stage a few minutes
later the marshal was tall lean and had
a still flowing movement like a boa con-
strictor that bill had once seen in a circus
his eyes were a gray-blue with shreds of
northern ice never melting they gave
bill knight an unpleasant shock
  kane outlers eyes didnt dart and stab
but went in an easy sweep that missed no
detail an indefinite stare his white
slender hands were still with latent power
near the broad belt that supported the
famous stag handled colts
  as bill knight stepped forward he
received the full force of outlers eyes
and bills lifting hand dropped back he
instinctively knew that outler would not
shake hands now
  im bill knight mr outler welcome
to watergap as outler nodded briefly
bill went on with unaccountable lack of
enthusiasm ive taken the liberty to
reserve you a room in the watergap hotel
-upstairs
  outler nodded again well go up
then he said
  as bill knight paced outler through
the lobby skirted the bar and climbed the
stairs to outlers room maries words
kept prodding him with different eyes
he noted the gunmans encompassing
glances that missed nobody weighed each
man they approached those slender hands
still and ready the tension crept into
bill knight the shuddery feeling of
hungry guns waiting waiting 
kane outler did not relax in the
room either he never turned his
back to bill knight as he investigated the
closet and looked under the bed bill tried
to conceal his surprise but knew that out-
ler had noted it
  outler said without humor coldly
youll learn knight-if you live had
a man take a shot at me from under a bed
once luckily i had tired of sleeping on
a straw bed and id had a cotton mattress
put on the day before
  bill knight felt uneasy a little choked
he wished they were already on tomor-
rows stage
  and it was no better in bed later
around midnight after tossing for two
hours bill knight got up and dressed
maybe a long walk would tire him enough
to sleep hell of a dodge city marshal
hed make foggy with sleepless nights   
  he spotted the two strangers at the
bar standing apart from the thinning
crowd from habit he started toward
them then lie remembered he was no
longer marshal here and shrugging went
out but his thoughts kept returning to
them the pale eyes that he had glimpsed
in the mirror of one the bulging frog
eyes of the other the crossed catridge
belts gunmen
  they were still in the nearly deserted
bar when he returned two hours later
bill turned through the bar and curley
trust a dead man
the bartender got off his stool and poured
him a drink he was raisin it to his
lips when the two moved up beside him
one on either side suddenly smoothly
under their stare curley moved back to
his stool
  youre bill knight asked pale
eyes
  thats right
  you and outler figger to leave for
dodge tomorrow
  thats right
  man needs money in dodge said
pale eyes i know where you can get
a lot of money five hundred aint that
right frog
  if he co-operated he could agreed
frog and was real smart he might
even get to be marshal of dodge hisself
  if kane outler was dead that is
said pale eyes
  bill knight knew the tight he was in
if he refused to help them kill kane
outler they wouldnt allow him to go
tell the marshal if he agreed he might
be the badmans marshal of dodge   
  bill knight set his glass down carefully
and they were pressing closer then pin-
ning his arms just enough without being
too obvious
  they had him bill knight knew that
and lifted his eyes to the mirror better to
see them both unbelievingly then he
stared into the mirror seeing the lean
fearful figure just inside the door kane
outlers cold eyes were wide and glaring
now and his white hands hovered over
the stag handled colts that showed like
bleached bones from the pushed back coat
  in that tension charged moment bill
knight knew clearly and without doubt
where outler had been he had been fol-
lowing bill knight the wolf in him had
felt bill knights unease that animal
instinct suspecting a trap and those glaring
eyes now told bill that he stood convicted
with those other two
  bill knight knew that those hungry
stag handled guns would make no dis-
tinctions his life hung by a slender
thread
  these two are out to kill you outler
bill said clearly they tried to ring me
in on it
  why damn you- began pale eyes
  bill knight shoved with his arms sud-
denly hard then went in a long dive along
the sawdust floor hands stretched above
his head theyre yours outler
  but his words were drowned panic-
stricken screams broke from the two gun-
men as they jerked at their colts then
kane outlers lead was skimming over
bill knight and the saloon rocked to the
thunder of those famous guns frog died
with his gun half out of leather and pale
eyes followed him so close that they fell
together with the dying pale eyes squeez-
ing off a shot into the sawdust floor 
slowly then some of the fearful tension
ran out of outler and the guns sagged al-
most imperceptibly
  those men have followed me from
santone outler said finally his voice
an even monotone they were hired to
kill me by a certain element in dodge
they could and would have made it in-
teresting to anyone who helped them
his cold eyes bored into bill knight
  i know said bill knight and his
own even speech astonished him they
offered me five hundred i was in a
tight he stood up and looked at out-
ler you followed me
  yes just to make sure why you were
prowling around after going to bed
there was no apology in outlers toneless
voice dont make it a habit to worry me
knight for a second the glare was back
then it was gone and he holstered his guns
get a pattern and no impulses under-
stand
  yeah i understand or i am beginning
to anyway marie understood before ana
she was right he knew now that kane
outler was killer first lawman second
  what snapped outler whos
marie
  my girl said bill knight then he
repeated softly my girl
  then under outlers stare bill knight
unbuckled his gunbelt and tossed it oh
the bar curley he said gently a
present for you i wont need it in the
hay and feed business
  he walked past kane outler and out
the door into the street in him was a
pressing urgency to see the worry and
fear in a pair of soft brown eyes turn to
shining happiness

trail-blazer leonard was so itchy for
trouble-he stirred up a nest of
arrow-sllnging hornets
the name of zenas leonard moun-
tain man author and pioneer trader
may not be too familiar to western
readers but he had a very prominent role
in the winning of the west
  he was born in clearfield pa in 
the same year that abraham lincoln was
born and he died in the year the great
emancipator was first elected president
that life span of fifty-one years was
eventful besides spending four years as
a trapper in the northwest during the
most exciting and dangerous period of
the fur trade he was among the first
americans to reach the pacific coast
  when zenas leonard was twenty-one
fears old he had a burning desire to
see the west

buckskin lobo

  stopping at pittsburgh which was
beginning to rise as a metropolis on the
he of old fort pitt he found gainful em-
yment for a year with a fresh stake
moved on to st louis in  the
mississippi river port ten miles from the
mouth of the missouri was the western
capital for the fur trade
  gant  blackwell were outfitting an
expedition to the northwest and leonard
joined them there were seventy in the
party that proceeded up the missouri
river to old fort osage near independ-
ence they paused there briefly then
headed up the kansas river to the mouth
of the republican trading with the kansas
indians en route
  going up the republican in a north-
westerly direction to the platte they took
the north fork of that stream they
passed chimney rock landmark in later
years for travelers on the oregon trail
on their way to the mouth of the laramie
river
  it was here that the party broke up
into three groups for the purpose of trap-
ing along the three rivers that emptied
ito the platte near this point one group
elected the timber river another
ascended the sweetwater while leonards
group under command of captain a k
stephens went up the laramie as far
as the medicine bow range in what is
now wyoming
  but it was rough going and their horses
died of starvation during the winter be-
cause of the scarcity of forage in despera-
tion captain stephens thought of santa
fe eight hundred miles to the south
  ive been there he told his haggard
men its on the santa fe trail and
i know well find horses there missouri
mules anyway
  they set out afoot-but the mountains
had them trapped after a struggle of
tan weeks through snow passes in which
they suffered severe hardships they re-
turned to their laramie river camp leon-
ard however wanted to try again and
m intrepid young frontiersman took
even men and set forth they might
have made it at that if they hadnt mis-
judged the population of an indian camp
which they attacked only a few braves
kmnged around as they opened fire
  the ftrt few shot atirred up a hornets
nest as redskins sprang up everywhere
there must have been several hundred
howling savages besides the screaming
squaws the mountain men beat a hasty
retreat and were glad to get away from
there alive
  that was the last attempt to reach
santa fe they returned to their camp
after being away for a month and the
entire group went back to the rendezvous
at the mouth of the stream there was
no sign of the others however
  about that time thomas fitzpatrick
well known trapper and guide in com-
mand of a group of one hundred and fifteen
men happened along he had news
  gant  blackwell are out of business
he told them but we need more men
why not join up with us
  they did and the former employees of
the st louis firm next found themselves
delivering supplies for fitzpatrick to trap-
pers on the snake river beyond tne
mountains
  the following summer four hundred
mountain men gathered at pierres hole
summer rendezvous holes came big
in those days for this one happened to
be a valley seventy miles in length and
ten miles wide
  they must have been scattered or hid-
den on july   for blackfeet in-
dians made the mistake of attacking them
on that day this was known as the
battle of pierres hole during the at-
tack leonard crawled on his hands and
knees and dragged a wounded comrade
to safety after which he returned to the
fray and fought until the invaders were
routed
  he was a man of action always wanting
to be on the move and when capt b l
e bonneville encamped on the green
river organized an expedition to explore
the country to the pacific coast leonard
and other trappers joined it he had al-
ways wanted to see the pacific and lieu-
tenant joseph reddiford walker who was
to command the group loved to explore
unknown regions leonard signed up as
a clerk
  walker had orders from bonneville to
take a small group of men and steer
through an unknown country to the pa-
cific whether this route was to take
them through california or the country

 story western magazine
to the north wasnt quite clear anyway
california was unknown and walker
who was from missouri may have ex-
ceeded hi authority in leading his party
in that direction zenas leonard might
have had something to do with it too
they couldnt have selected a tougher
route
  leaving the green river they pro-
ceeded down the humbolt and began the
arduous journey over the sierra nevada
mountains some historians believe they
dicovered the yosemite valley and were
the first to see the famous giant redwood
trees on the western slopes of the moun-
tain range but they never stopped to
plant any flags
  a week later they heard a distant rum-
bling like thunder and were alarmed-
until they learned that they were ap-
proaching the pacific
  if this phenomenon of sound startled
them they were in for a greater sensation
a few nights later-november  -
when they saw an immense shower of
meteors negro slaves in the southern
states saw that heavenly display also and
dropped to their knees in terror for it
was the year the stars fell
after all this the men were ready
for a drink or two and they were
afforded all they wanted when they reached
the northern arm of san francisco bay
where a ship lay at anchor it was the
lagoda from boston and captain brad-
shaw its master invited the explorers
to come aboard
  i have a few casks of cognac that need
sampling he told them with a smile
its a long trip around the horn
  it was a hard trip across the sierras
too and the sailors and landlubber
mountain men drank and fraternized for
several day walkers men spent several
months visiting the spaniards in san
jose san juan and monterrey in the
spring of  they began the return
trip which wasnt quite as tough but
bad enough they rejoined bonneville
on the great salt lake
  as in yeart gone by the brigade was
broken up into smaller groups for trap-
ping purposes leonards group trapped
on the tongue wind powder yellow-
stone and big porcupine rivers ending
up on the popo agie where they again
rejoined bonneville it was a profitable
year for leonard
  he returned to independence in au-
gust  with bonneville and his party
and eleven hundred dollars which wasnt
exactly chicken feed in those days when
a dollar went a considerable distance he
kept on going to clearfield pa where
the young explorer was welcomed as
warmly by his parents as if he were the
prodigal son since nothing had been
heard from him since his departure five
years before
  but leonard grew a little weary of
reciting over anti over his adventures to
citizens of his home town instead he
got the idea of putting it into writing-
so the young explorer turned author
  his story was printed in weekly in-
stallments in the clearfield republican
and the usual continued next zveek at
the foot of each chapter left townspeople
agog and anxious for the next copy when
the yarn was printed in book form it was
entitled narrative of the adventures of
zenas leonard
  unfortunately the newspaper plant was
destroyed by fire all but two copies
of the book went up in smoke the pub-
lisher had one copy at home the author
the other a limited edition of the book
was finally printed in 
  however a few months in his home
town was all he could bear the call of
the west again beckoned to leonard and
his restless soul obeyed this time he
stopped at sibley on the site of old fort
osage where in  he established a
trading post he outfitted traders of the
santa fe trail as well as taking care of
the needs of local customers
  as if this wasnt enough to keep him
busy he ran a string of boats on the
missouri between cogswell landing at
the mouth of fire prairie creek and st
louis upstream came indian trinkets
and yankee notions downstream went
furs to the st louis market
  zenas leonard died in  and was
buried in sibley cemetery a grandson
william d leonard lives in kansas
city-and zenas leonards fame survives
among historians who still quote him as
an authority on western lore and an out-

                 history for mm 
james bowie who gave his name
to a famous knife was no legendary
figure he was a real flesh and blood
frontiersman who lived a vigorous life
and died a heros death in the alamo yet
most of his lifes history is cloaked in leg-
end david crockett who also perished
in that flaming cauldron of texas inde-
pendence left a biography but not bowie
he was just too busy to give it much
thought
  it is said that he rode aligators in loui-
siana speared wild cattle much in the
manner of chasing buffalo fought duels in
dark rooms with the bowie knife and
bartered with laffite the pirate for ivory
m the texas gulf coast all of this before
he went to san antonio and married the
daughter of the vice-governor of texas
bowie was a forceful leader of men
bat a meek follower of the goddess of for-
it wasnt the flick of a card or the
treasure
of
san saba
 by dave sands
      turn of a wheel that intrigued him he
      was a high stake gambler who asked no
      odds he gambled with his life not money
      for a great cause or for the chance of
      finding gold or silver in his zealous search
      ter the famed lost mines on the san saba
      river his exploits rivaled those of other
      great figures in frontier history
       one account handed down by fron-
tiersmen relates that bowie went to texas
about  or about the time the lipan
indians made the llano river region their
hunting grounds chief of the lipans a
branch of the far-flung apaches was
xolic who led his people on a bartering
expedition to san antonio every six
months taking along a small amount of
silver bullion for that purpose there
was a little gold mixed in the silver ore
which led residents of san antonio to
believe it was chipped off a rich vein
  efforts to learn more were futile as the
lipans were sworn to secrecy under penal-
ty of a slow death by torture but if the
mexicans and spaniards gave up easily
the americans were more persistent one
of these was james bowie
 as part of his campaign to win the
friendship of the lipans he presented a
fine silver-plated rifle imported from the
east to chief xolic after a powwow
bowie became a member of the tribe in
a ceremony at san pedro springs in
the months that followed he became adept
at hunting buffalo and battling enemies of
the tribe in fact he became such a good
warrior and brave that his patience and
efforts were rewarded by a peek into the
tribes treasure trove
 bowie was amazed at what he saw

so
 story wesiern magazine
whether it was a great storehouse full of
smelted bullion or natural veins of ore
mattered little the fact remained that
there was millions of dollars worth of
spanish gold and silver there he had no
sooner learned the secret than he took
leave of the tribe and headed for san an-
tonio he would need help if he planned
to lift the treasure by force
  but bowie was between the devil and
the deep blue sea too large an army
would mean too many with whom to di-
vide the wealth too small a force would
mean dismal failure in the venture while
he was making plans chief xolic passed
to his happy hunting grounds and was
succeeded by tres manos three hands
a young warrior who was not so kindly
disposed to the adopted member of the
tribe in fact he lost no time in going
to san antonio and accusing bowie of
treachery it nearly cost him his life too
  so much for the off-the-record ac-
count another version of the same story
which has some historical basis relates
that bowie with ten other men including
his brother rezin p bowie set out on
an expedition to locate the lost spanish
mines on november   among the
others was cephas k ham who played an
important part in the explorations
  both accounts claimed that james bowie
had been in the san saba country before
looking for gold and silver but if he had he
acted mighty queer for one who apparently
knew where he was going so much time
was consumed in examining the nature of
the country as he put it that he hadnt
arrived at the abandoned fort on the san
saba after more than two weeks in spite
of the fact that it was but a hundred and
fifty miles from san antonio
the site of the old presidio was thought
	to have been only a mile from the
mines and was the main target of their
expedition why did jim bowie wander
for nearly three weeks did he have other
information 
  they were told by a friendly coman-
che on november  that hostile savages
were in the vicinity for the most part
they were tehuacanas caddo-- and wacos
whether three hands and his lipans
were in the war party was not learned
  they struck at dawn on the st-a
hundred and sixty-four strong or about
fifteen to one but the bowie camp wasnt
caught napping in fact they had forty-
eight hours to prepare for the assault
  the battle raged all day fifty redskins
were killed and thirty-five wounded one
texan was dead and three were wounded
but most of the mine hunters horses were
killed or crippled and they remained in
the camp for another week licking their
wounds one of the men by the name of
buchanan was badly wounded in the leg
and they boiled some live oak bark
thickened it with powdered charcoal and
indian meal made a poultice of it and tied
it around buchanans leg a piece of buf-
falo skin was sewed around the bandage
his recovery was rapid
  time hung heavily on their hands and
during the period of convalescence some
of the able bodied members of the party
found a cave near the camp which served
to place the location of the battle about
six miles east of the presidio instead of
twenty-five miles east as was generally be-
lieved it took them ten days to limp
hack to san antonio
  according to cephas ham he-not
bowie-was adopted by indians but they
were comanches not lipans and their
chief was incorroy he was on horse
trading expeditions with the tribe in 
when he almost saw the mine the price
of a good horse was two brass rings eight
balls of lead a pint of powder a butcher
knife and a plug of tobacco and they
caught mustangs and drove them to loui-
siana
  one of hams hunting companions was
a fat warrior one day he took the texan
into his confidence
  plenty silver other side he said
pointing to a hill we go alone i show
you but others mustnt know they kill
us
  the fat brave was unable to keep his
promise however for the camp moved on
next day then ham received a message
from james bowie saying that the mexi-
cans and comanches were on the verge of
war when he arrived in san antonio
he learned that the real purpose of bowies
warning was to enlist hams aid in his
search for the san saba treasure the ex-
pedition then took its departure
  rezin p bowie had already been to
treasure of san saba

the mine ham said it wasnt far from
the fort rezin descended to the bottom
of the eight-foot shaft on steps hewn from
an oak log with his tomahawk he hacked
off some ore and took it to new orleans
where the assay showed it to be of excel-
lent quality fie returned to san antonio
and his further moves were chronicled in
the historical account of the expedition
  jim bowie did not give up the search
however jason was no more persistent in
his quest of the golden fleece than this
man bowie he raised a second expedi-
tion of thirty men all authorities agree
this time according to ham he got to
the san saba but failed to find the shaft
which had been filled up however he
may have found it and was getting ready
to develop it when the war between texas
and mexico broke out many texans
too were insistent in their belief that
bowies real motive for getting hold of the
san saba wealth was to help finance the
texas army in its battle for independence
  one authority believed that the lipans
showed bowie several hundred jack loads
of pure silver that had been moulded into
bars and stored in a cave instead of a
mine there also is a story that five hun-
dred dollars was paid to a mexican for a
document that one of santa annas officers
took from the dead body of jim bowie in
the alamo it purportedly gave directions
for finding the mine but for some rason
or other the purchaser was unable to find
it be that as it may many believe to
this day that bowie died on that th day
of march  knowing where untold
wealth was hidden
   out of all this welter of fact and fiction
it seems that jim bowie set out for the
mines all right and must have known
its location for his name appears on two
different stone gateposts of the old stock-
ade ruins on the san saba one badly
mutilated bore the date  while an-
other more plainly reads
bowie
mine

  whether jim bowie carved his name
on either of these gateposts near the
northwest entrance to the presidio along
with the dates will never be definitely
known but the last san saba mine has
ever after been known as the bowie mine
four years later as col bowie he led his
company in the so-called grass fight
when he mistook bundles of hay loaded on
mexican mules for bags of silver with
which to pay off the soldiers of general
cos and with a hundred and eighty-
odd other texans he carved his name
indelibly in the minds of the common
people for his brave part in achieving tex-
as independence

the voice pulled him around on his

up the sidewalk toward him and the street
in their vicinity had cleared of everyone
else bristow saw hipe luckinbill cross-
bone foreman in the middle with two of
tunis saddle stiffs flanking him hipe
a stocky man whose face showed nothing
but aloofness had skin the color of coffee
surly suspicious eyes a straight slit of
a mouth and no friendliness whatever for
anyone
  there was a tenseness in the way the
trio walked that told of strung-tight nerves
and a guarded though aggressive interest
in the man who stood beneath the arcade
waiting still-faced and completely motion-

  there was all at once a queer lack of
sound in this part of the town three pairs
of spurs came jingling to a halt the cow-

pace behind hipe one at each of his el-

a word with you-at the shindy
  bristows rangy frame showed an idle-

of his steady eyes he sized the men up
deliberately then bluntly said tell tunis

move to look around but he knew the

said then murmured ral clyde tunis

  the sheriffs bristly white eyebrows
knotted together in a troubled frown

like you less if you did but son tunis

men here figure him for top-dog in the
valley in a years time scatterday for one
will pardee for another its all over the

tow told him softly id make him prove
it or take it back
  youre proud said the sheriff trou-
bledly and pride kills more men than
courage well maybe youll change when
youve talked to verna
      at the far end of the street where
the beaten road petered out to a stretch of
vega with a creek and scrub-covered ridges
a mile beyond stood verna reddings
small slab-plank bungalow under a pair
of live oaks whose reaching boughs
drooped long festoons of spanish moss
a hollyhock border rimmed the yard and
a foot path that brought bristow to a
porch and a shadowed door
  at his knock the door opened as though
verna had seen him coming and was wait-
ing with a hand on the latch bristow
pulled off his hat and stood rargy and
grave saying quietly verna howve

 story western magazine
you been  their eyes met fair and direct
  she was a slim fair girl of twenty-five
straight-standing well-formed of body and
limb a girl who in a land where most
women lost their allure managed always
to look fresh and sweet in the simple
things she wore today she was dressed
in a plain gingham frock cut low enough
to show her softly rounded throat and
the gentle curves of shoulders and breast
  she said very softly ral you are
an easy-going man you come and go
and stay away as if life were bound to last
a thousand years come in
  he followed her through the doorway
and she faced him in a room that held a
table a sewing machine and the neat dis-
order of a dress-makers workship she
snatched a bolt of yard goods from an
easy chair and made a place for him to
sit but he remained standing the shad-
ows of the room made the chiseled angles
of his dark face stronger his gaze stayed
quietly on hers color rose against her
cheekbones she was pleased by his glance
he said i rode in hopin youd let me
take you to the dance its been a long
time since the last one
  she was smiling as he spoke but now
soberness came to her eyes he remem-
bered that this was the girl he had known
so long a time and yet nothing had ever
been any different than it was now-a
quiet pleasure in each others company
  a long time she echoed and each
time it grows longer ral she told him
candidly im going to the dance with
will pardee
  my usual luck he answered chagrin
in his gaze he saw regret in hers adding
with one of his rare smiles tell will
ill be cuttin in tonight
  bristows room was at the front of the
hotel with a single window overlooking
the second-story porch the bed looked
good but he slept on the floor after pull-
ing the tick into a corner out of range of
the window he knew about what to ex-
pect of tunis and his rough-head crew
and the sheriff had warned him a gun-
fight was coming of that he was sure
and he had no intention of letting them
slaughter him while asleep
  he slept three hours at three oclock
ome outside sound awakened him he got
ob the floor hand on his gun and hftsd
the window shade peering out on the
upper gallery but seeing no one then
he heard the voices in the street below
he stepped through the open window and
went to the railing
  his own spring wagon and team of
blacks stood before the hotel lacey and
springer the remainder of his crew sal
on the scat and clint osburn stood with
a hand on springers saddle-whitened
knee speaking swiftly urgently
  bristow called down you got the calf
boys
  all the men looked up and lacey nod-
ded and motioned toward a canvas tarp
stretched over the rear of the wagon bed
evrthins like you said ral lacey
called back soberly both men were wear-
ing guns on their belts and a pair of
sharps rifles lay on the floorboards at
their feet
  drape the hides on the hitch rack and
tie the calf near em bristow ordered
be right down
  when he reached the street five min-
utes later the scene was set as he had
planned it here was the main drag ly-
ing bright with afternoon sunlight on the
rusty-colored dust and on the saddles of
the rows of ranch horses a group of rid-
ers and townsmen had gathered before the
hotel and others were hurrying up under
the arcades drawn by the sight of a bawl-
ing brindle calf that had been tied to the
hitch rail close to a brindle cows fly-
swarming hide that still dripped blacken-
ing blood
  the crowd was staring at the fresh
brand on the calf-a plainly marked blot-
ting job that represented the crossbone
of clyde tunis but the brand on the hide
draped over the rail was bristows b-bar
unmistakably
as bristow came up clint osburn
gave him a nerved-up grin that
showed his broken teeth keep cool son
here they come now
  down the street three men were strid-
ing toward the scene before the hotel-
luckinbill lefever dawkins behind
them dimly seen on the gallery of the
shindy bar sat tunis and two other
crossbone men
  hipe luckinbill and the two gun-slam-
mer butted their way through the crowd
hot blood brands the crossbone

and halted all the three staring incredu-
lously at the blatting calf and the hide of
its mother
  bristow  hipes voice was harsh with
anger his eyes were only streaks against
the coffee-colored toughness of his face
whats this damned foolishness about
if its got anything to do with crossbone
i want it stopped
  bristow stood with his back to the hotel
porch railing he felt steady and cold a
kind of deadly amusement glittered in his
eyes
  whats it look like hipe come on
and see for yourself
  the trouble had reached its climax here
before the crowd and that was the way
bristow had planned it he had kept the
business of the calf and its mothers hide
to himself and to the members of his own
crew consequently the dramatic impact
was explosive here before the crowd be-
fore part of the crossbone crew was the
flat indisputable proof of clyde tunis
nefarious activities against b-bar the
crossbone-brandcd calf bawling so mourn-
fully at the hide of a b-bar cow was
all the evidence needed to run clyde
tunis and his rowdies out of town out
of the country out of the state
  up the street a womans voice cried
somebody get the sheriff stop them
before the shooting starts
  the cry had a steadying sobering ef-
fect on the tempers of hipe and his men
but hipes leathery face worked in a
twitching way that told of his inward fury
and discomfiture
  bristows greenish eyes squinted with
contempt he said slowly carefully yet
with anger theres the proof that b-
bar cow was shot theres her hide
theres the calf wearin your brand if
youve got anything to say make vour
talk
  hipe swallowed hard his slitted gaze
swung from side to side seeing the grim
looks on the faces of the crowd seeing
the bleak triumph on bristows the watch-
ful wariness on those of the b-bar crew
then he snarled an oath and wheeled
striding furiously back toward the shindy
bar lefever and dawkins hung back a
moment eyeing bristow in a hungry way
then they too whirled and walked away
  the crowd began to disperse murmur -
ously in the crowd bristow knew full
well were a few of clyde tunis friends
but now they would keep silent about any
sympathy they might hold for the cross-
bone boss the business of the hide and
the calf had accomplished this much-it
had driven bristows enemies to cover
except for tunis and his crew they
would be out after his scalp within a mat-
ter of hours and there would be the
shoot-out bristow wanted before another
dawn he was ready for that fight actu-
ally welcomed it for it was the only sure
way of putting an end to rustling in high
valley the only way of heading off his
own eventual bankruptcy and ruin
in oddfellows hall a block
north of the hotel the fiddles and gui-
tars had started up and there rose from
the long many-windowed building the
sounds of scraping feet moving in the
rhythm of a waltz of young girls tittering
laughter the maturer laughter of women
and men caught up in the keen excite-
ment of the night
  when he left his room in the hotel
bristow went to a restaurant across from
the livery stable and had his supper with
the b-bar crew the four men ate in si-
lence but each man had his instructions
for the evening when they finished the
meal and bristow paid the bill they left
one at a time and took up prearranged
positions along the four-block street and
were immediately lost to view
  bristow was the last to leave the res-
taurant he went at once to the hall and
bought his ticket kept the stub and went
inside paused against the wall under the
flickering chandeliers he searched the
groups of revolving couples on the broad
dance floor for the woman he now belated-
ly knew he had to win for his wife
  he finally found her waltzing with will
pardee her glance came to him as though
she had been waiting and watching for
his arrival then swung away as pardee
turned her in his arms and returned again
he saw her smile flash toward him reach-
ing through the turning swaying crowd
as clear an invitation as a man ever had
from a woman
  pardee saw vernas head turn and
glanced across the hall a stain of resent-
ment rising feo hie dark long-jwd face

 story western magazine
he was dressed in evening clothes boiled
shirt swallowtail coat trousers pulled
tight by straps fastened under the soles
of patent leather boots
  bristow dropped his half-smoked ciga-
rette into a sand-filled crack against the
wall and walked out on the dance floor
a solid force moving in a straight line
his surroundings the confusion of lights
and voices and music faded away and he
saw only verna and knew only one thing
this time he wasnt going to lose her
  he reached them touched pardee on
the shoulder gathered the girl in his em-
brace and swung her away before her
partner knew what had happened then
the fiddles ended the waltz and applause
washed over the crowded room with its
festoons of crepe paper and candle lan-
terns
  they stood close vernas gaze lifted
to his ive been worried she whis-
pered all the talk about tunis-
where can we go to be alone  he said
impatiently
  she looked around the room then back
at him i dont know but ral-
ive got to talk to you 
  please ral everybodys looking at
ta
  but he waa determined he held her
arm and began steering her through the
crowd the band started up with the
opening bars of a square dance the caller
sang choose your pardnersf and then
began his chant
 pour in the middle and
cant git about
turn cinnamon turn 
  a rough hand clapped bristows shoul-
der gripped and spun him half way
around bristows gaze veered toward
wfll pardee who had come up behind
him through the stamping swaying cou-
ples cm the floor pardees eyes gleamed
hat listen cowpunk he said in a
jarring tone youre butting in on the
wrong man 
  bristow thrust his arm out straight
and hard the force of hit pash staggered
the other man back a pace bristows
face was saturnine but calm he did not
speak pardee went white with fury he
gathered his muscular body as if to spring
at bristow and his mouth was stretched
back savagely then came the volley of
revolver shots outside the hall
ohapt peaceftajzel pesidutioi
      the dancing stopped as men and
women whirled staring toward the street
doors the fiddles and guitars petered out
to silence the caller quit in the middle
of a word
  a small man with a red face poked his
head in the doorway hollering gun-
fight evybuddy duck
  bristow was on his way out of the hall
moving with long reaching strides that
carried him swiftly through the gaping
startled groups of men and women on the
floor they parted ranks to let him pass
and those who inadvertently blocked his
way he bumped aside with elbows and
arms
  the street streaky with shadows and
the outshining lights of late-closing shops
looked empty but there was a huddled
figure lying in the center of the square a
shapeless crumple of a man resting on his
aide both arms hugging his knees against
his body as in pain
  bristow strode into the street a voice
-laceys-called from nearby shadows
be careful ral
  then bristow saw the red glow of ciga-
rettes farther down the street under the
arcade near the hotel across from those
two hidden figures another pair of ciga-
rettes glowed and faded like red eyes
in the darkness
  bristow said to lacey softly cover
me and walked directly to the fallen
man
  it was clint osburn the old man had
been hard hit his grizzled face was con-
torted and he was softly groaning bris-
tow got down on a knee he lifted the
foreman in both arms and held him sup-
porting his head from which the hat had
fallen iron-gray hair clung wetlv to his
wrinkled brow osburn opened his eyes
and they were bitterly bright
  tunis   he gasped got me in
   the belly tried to stop him he   
was goin in the hall
  whyd you do it clint i told you
id handle him
  ah them wimmen in there the old
hot blood brands the crossbone

man whispered that varmint wouldnt
keer who lie hit ral im a goner wisht
i knowed the end of this trail son it   
its a new one
  bristows jaw knotted rest easy
pard he breathed nothing to fret
yourself about rest easy now he low-
ered the foremans head rose and hauled
off his coat rolling it while he watched
the street then bent and pillowed it under
clint
  boots were clumping up the sidewalk
from the courthouse through the shad-
ows sheriff limes came striding with
two deputies the pair of cigarettes had
ceased their glowing on that side of the
street the men who had stood there had
disappeared down an alleyway yonder
before the hotel was vague movement
those two still waited in the dark watch-
ing perhaps with guns still gripped
  bristow didnt wait for the sheriff to
reach the scene he went back to the
shadows and found lacey waiting a hand
resting on his gun an ugly scowl on his
leathery face bob said bristow find
sam and keep watchin the street im go-
in  after tunis
  inside the hall the hand began again but
half the crowd was pushing out through
the open doors cautious staring wonder-
ing and then a slender figure came run-
ning through the shadows it was verna
rending her hair disarranged bristows
name on her lips in a low choked cry
  ral she said will pardee left the
hall by the back door he-had a revolver
in his hand
  bristow gripped her by the arms his
face stern almost forbidding in its savage
calmness verna go back inside stay
there till i come for you that was all
then he wheeled and started down the
walk
  his right elbow broke upward his
hand lay against the coolness of his guns
bone butt as he walked he cocked the
hammer over a live shell and left it cocked
  he heard brisk movement under the
darkened arcade a hundred feet ahead of
him he ducked aside and moved along
n the dark against the building fronts
the last few lights in stores had gone out
extinguished as by swiftly flattened hands
a stock trains staccato stack thunder
wai coming up freverti grade a mile
east of town the sound increasingly
filled the night then the engines whistle
screamed for the lower crossing
  bristow reached the corner of the hotel
and there halted flat against the gallery
his gaze swinging this was the spot
where he had seen the first two glowing
ends of cigarettes there was a narrow
passage running rearward beside the hotel
he entered it and made his way through
blackness as deep as that in a mine
  then ahead of him in the hotels rear
quarter someone fell over a barrel of emp-
ty food tins the clatter was brief but
through it he heard a man softly cursing
he quickened his pace and broke out in
the rear yard fully halted his gun drawn
and ready against his thigh
  he caught the movement of a man
perhaps two ducking hack toward the
street through another alley to the south
in a silence so profound he was aware
of the thud of his own boots on the earth
bristow ran toward that alley
  then the alleys darkness was split
asunder by the stabbing flash of a six-gun
fired at him the bullet slapped a shed
behind him and the crash of the shot left
his ears ringing and half deaf he flat-
tened himself to the ground raising his
weapon then lowering it he heard boots
and spurs clanking at a run toward the
street
  he was up and pursuing instantly but
very wary now his night eyes working
at last his guess was that someone was
baiting him farther from the heart of
town perhaps somewhere near the cattle
pens where he would be cornered by the
whole crossbone crew and shot down like
a dog
  he smiled savagely to himself at the
thought he had no intention of continu-
ing this game of fox and hounds and
as he came sliding out of the alley and
hit the street he tried to put himself in
tunis boots and in that space of a
short-drawn breath he made his guess
where he would find the man he meant to
kill
  staring toward the railroad depot some
three hundred yards away he saw two
men moving surreptitiously away from
him beneath the overhead wooden awn-
ings every few feet this pair hesitated
paused and stared back toward him

 story western magazine
there was only one splash of light at
this end of town it came under and
over the batwing blinds of the shindy
bar about a hundred feet away bristow
glanced back toward the hall and the
crowd that now was standing in the street
with earn gripped in a sweating palm he
walked to the next alley ducked into it
then ran swiftly to the rear yards once
more
  seconds later he came behind the sa-
loon found a door that was unlocked and
let himself into a rank-smelling passage-
way at the street end of it a sliver of
yellow light gleamed down low against
the floor he went toward it left hand
brushing the passage wall his boots mak-
ing scarcely any sound he reached an-
other door patently leading into the bar-
room there was the muffled rumble of
mens voices beyond the panel
  he found the door knob gave it a
twist flung the door inward violently
checked himself with slittod eyes then
entered the room with two long strides
  there were five men in the room at the
har a pallid-faced barkeeper behind it
bristow saw clyde tunis standing at the
far end his back to the doors which had
been closed and bolted against the outer
blinds
  next to tunis stood will pardee and
next to pardee were three crossbone gun-
hands their backs turned to bristow that
meant four of tunis men were out in
the town waiting to cut him down when
he walked into their trap
  as bristow entered all five at the bar
swung about their faces swam into
focus and tunis stiffened shock in his
staring eyes will pardee glanced over
his shoulder and then froze motionless
his frock coat and white shirt looked
incongruous here beside the sweaty dusty
riding garb of his companions the three
gunmen caught flat-footed by surprise
blinked and started raising arms and
hands to shoulder height
  bristow stood spread-legged near the
door he held his gun straight-armed be-
side him  his expression was unreadable
his keen eyes saw the bartender bend
cautiously reaching with a furtive gesture
beneath his bar bristow warned never
mind the shotgun
  the barkeep shot arms and hands
toward the smoky ceiling his mouth drop-
ping and swinging like a loose flap all
talk had died outside was the sound of
men running the walks then came scat-
tered shots and a voice yelled in unex-
pected pain
  clyde tunis recovered himself like a
man shocked awake his big boot slipped
off the brass rail and thudded dully to th
floor his spur chimed once bristow
didnt speak for a moment only stared at
tunis the other men also bracketed in hs
gaze then he said very softly go
ahead tunis  im givin you the draw
tunis hadnt expected this tiny
twinkling beads of sweat showed on his
reddened cheeks next to him parde
never moved both hands gripping the
edge of the bar his black eyes bright and
bitter and hating bristow with silent fury
the three gun-hands hardly seemed
breathing
  wait tunis finally found voice to
speak you-wouldnt shoot your tur-
key cold i
  the three hands squeezed their bodies
against the bar as if trying to merg
themselves with the wood and become in-
visible pardee stood statue-still his head
frozen in a three-quarter turn face now
inscrutable
  there was not a man here and that in-
cluded the bartender but would take
pleasure in shooting bristow where he
stood if he could have done so without
risk and so bristow was compelled to
gauge the others and try to guess which
one would draw and fire the second he
threw his gun on tunis
  to the crossbone boss he said in a
thin-lipped way make your draw i
dont want it said i shot a sfttin bird
more distant shots came through the
saloons closed doors somewhere down
near the stock pens a wicked dogfight was
going on then a kind of groaning gasp
seemed to explode from tunis he went
for his belted gun pitching his burly body
into the clawing motion as if trying to
hurry his draw with every muscle ana all
of his will
  the big mans fingers locked over the
six-gun and he drew it with a bleating
cry stripping the long barrel clear of
leather with a jerk and standing side-
ways in one swift movement
hot blood brands the crossbone
bristow waited a split-second then
bent his arm and fired there was an
instant in which eternity was suspended
before two shots banged in the rooms
trapped silence a third followed as par-
dee pulled a parlor gun from his vest and
took snap aim at bristow letting go bris-
tows hat jerked on his head
  tunis was going down bent double his
six-gun falling to the floor his face twist-
ed in agony there was a bullet in the
hollow under bristows shoulder bone
the impact knocked him back a pace it
was pardees lead that had hit him
  and even as he swung his gun on par-
dee the dark man fired again though the
bullet sliced through bristows shirt be-
tween elbow and ribs he had to silence
that derringer for if he fell he knew
pardee would fire again and again into his
prone body would end his life in the sa-
loons sawdust and a pool of blood
  bristow let go with his second shot
not aiming not pulling the trigger but
slapping the hammer back and letting it
fall against the nested shell
  he heard and saw the bullet slug into
pardees chest and stagger him around
bristow fired again pardee seemed sud-
denly pinned against the bar his mouth
contorted his eyelids whitening with
strain as he fought to lift the tiny pistol
in his hand then he fell turning half
way around like a man feeling for a step
in the dark his long body dropped over
the prone one of clyde tunis
  oblivious to the hot agony in his shoul-
der bristow pinned the three gun-hands
and the barkeep with his icy eyes
through a halo of gunsmoke he said
there wouldnt be many complaints if
i made it a massacre so dont move
  with these murmured words he cov-
ered the four men with his gun and
started backing toward the bolted doors
he came against them reached back and
shot the bolt at the same instant boots
came kicking up on the saloons gallery
voices shouted in the street bristow
pulled aside still covering the men before
the liar and the saloonman behind it who
st i  held his hands high
  sheriff limes came lurching in with the
aged riders stalking gait a deputy fol-
lowed him and then the crowd came push-

ing through the batwing blinds limes
took one look around the smoky room
then went over and stirred pardees life-
less body with a boot he glanced over
his shoulder saying wearily all right
ral you bad your way reckon it was
bettern mine he sighed adding we
got four of em near the depot they
was forted up waitin-oh hell some-
body call the coroner
  bristow brought his six-gun back and
down into its brush-scuffed holster there
was blood dripping off his wrist-not
much he said to the sheriff i want the
doc for coburn and fast
  limes waved him away impatiently
clints goin to pull through the bul-
let only punctured him
  lacey and springer bristows men
walked with him up the street toward the
hall whose windows looked ike yellow
squares against the summer night at the
halls doors bristow turned and said
hire me a team and buckboard at the
livery well have company goin home
he went into the hall where small
groups of women huddled waiting for the
men to return he found verna waiting
in the shadows near one of the wide-open
windows the night wind stirred her hair
and she faced around as he came up he
said gently how longll it take you to
get ready
  she stood before him tremulous sud-
denly her gray eyes shining up at him
ready ready for what ral
  to get married he told her and put
his arms around her and pulled ber close
the pain of his wound was nothing now
but she saw the blood gasping ral
youre hurt
  not bad ill take you home and find
the doc and the preacher while youre
packing
  she said in a whisper now ral

cry on and
why pretend

    red sovine is a comparative tenderfoot
 among the folk singers but already his
 steel guitar has gotten a lot of favorable
 notice and here when he sings im
only a shoulder to cry on
so why should i waste my love on you 
red sovine has a quiet instrumental back-
ground to accompany his straight-from-
the-heart song-stvling
    the other side of the coupling is just
 as effectively chanted in an easy relaxed
 vein by red sovine its the familiar but
 never old story of a cowpuncher who
 realizes that vou dont love me anymore

 forgot that ace prackett won not only
 every cent of mine that night but he won
 my watch and my horn-handled colt
 too
   it sank in sheriff beri jenks had been
 about to draw but his hand stopped in
 mid-air koles face was a twisted mask
 of fury and his hand was slashing for his
 colt he yanked thumbed hammer on the
 throw
   johnny was half-paralyzed ifhe killed
 the man his excuse would sound thin it
 was then that he saw close-cut petes
 hand reach out light flashing off the open
 razor
   a second or so later blood was spurting
 koles six bouncing to the floor youve
 cut me kole screamed
   tell them kole johnny yelled
 tell how you lied when you said i killed
 lafe tell them i couldnt have done it
 ace prackett had my hom-handle gun i
 left town that night unarmed and you
 know it
   the spurting blood left koles face
 blanched white he clutched his slashed
 wrist and nodded yes to johnnys ac-
