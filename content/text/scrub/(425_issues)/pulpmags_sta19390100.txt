the late

stanley g weinbaum

author of the black flame

by

otto binder

popular author of many science fiction novels and stories

stanley g weinbaum

martian odyssey his first sci-
ence fiction story brought stanley g
weinbaum instant recognition who
can forget the amazing lovable twe-e-r-
r-rl it was only the first of many fascinat-
ing creatures of other worlds-master-mind
oscar of the lotus-eaters the pathetically
dumb loonies the demoniac trioptes   
he brought them to life with a deft master-
ful touch

  his human characters were lifelike and
colorful-van manderpootz acid-tongued
and so modest dixon wells always late and
always sorry the red peri queen of the
spaceways and others

  weinbaum wove these creatures and char-
acters into story situations that held sus-
pense from the first to the last word

  it is amazing to me as an author how
weinbaum could produce in steady succes-
sion stories of such excellent composition
and originality worlds of if was and per-
haps still is the best exposition to date of
the multiple-universe idea circle of zero
breathed the true chilling atmosphere of
the unending-world theory his brink of
infinity was the only story that ever made
pure dry mathematics an engrossing theme

a model of simplicity

  weinbaums style of writing has been a
model of simplicity and sincerity never since
duplicated by other authors in our field if
story-telling is a gift weinbaum had it
i believe personally that if he had lived
hs v-ould eventually have earned a place
alongside such masters of fantasy as verne
wells merritt and burroughs

  one had only to meet weinbaum to ap-
preciate why he wrote good stories i vis-
ited him in milwaukee one summers day
and passed one of the most interesting
afternoons of my life his reading knowl-

edge of science was tremendous and up-to-
date his fund of new story-ideas seemed
exhaustless his imagination was power-
ful

unbounded enthusiasm

  but most of all weinbaum had an un-
bounded enthusiasm for science fiction in
the last analysis i think it is that quality
that shines through his work and gives it its
inimitable appeal weinbaum honestly put
his heart and soul into his writing he was
not above a little satire at times but always
with a core of sincerity behind it all

  we talked of many things that afternoon
but particularly of the future of science fic-
tion

  weinbaum predicted that science fiction
would or should soon pass out of its phase
of stilted classical form and into a phase
stressing human interest and realistic style
of presentation he has been right wein-
baum himself was not the least of the forces
that molded this change for the better in
sciencc fiction

a real loss

  weinbaums death was a real loss to sci-
ence fiction he had set a pace that made
the rest of us writers sit up and take no-
tice he was leading the way to new un-
touched heights in creativeness and sci-
ence fiction benefited

  it is a fitting commentary on wcinbaums
work that three years after his death his
writings are still being published

  i feel that the editors of startling
stories are paying a fine tribute to his
memory in presenting this story the black
flame 

  it comes close in my opinion to being the
masterpiece of weinbaums facile pen

prophets of science

 a guest editorial
 by otis acelbeut kline

  well-known scientifiction novelist

prevision or prophecy is older than
civilization

every religious faith known to mod-
ern man has had its prophets and the rec-
ords of their predictions can be found not
only in the bible but in the writings of
people whose chronicles predate the scrip-
tures by many thousands of years

  with the rise of the age of
science have come the prophets
of science-those who pre-
dicted that diseases were
caused by the attacks of micro-
organisms and not as was once
believed by the unwelcome at-
tentions of devils those who
predicted that man would fly
through the air with the great-
est of ease and were ridiculed
and persecuted for their be-
liefs

  darius green and his fly-
ing machine is an example of
the ridicule in which this be-
lief was held it remained for
the wright brothers to make this dream
come true with the first heavier-than-air
flying machines

  many impossibilities of two generations
ago have become commonplace today the
airplane the radio and talking pictures are
perhaps the most familiar representing in-
dustries in which billions of dollars have
been invested but there are many others

  for example not quite so well known to
the public are the hundreds of practical uses
to which the photoelectric cell has been
put it opens and closes doors soundlessly

otis adelbert kline

in the manufacturing world it inspects ma-
chine-made articles with an accuracy and
speed impossible to any human being re-
jecting those which are imperfect and pass-
ing those which meet the required stand-
ards

  it stops and starts huge machines
punches or prints bus and elevated transfers
with the exact date time and
identification numbers and
even detects burglars calls the
police and sounds an alarm

  to many people who lived
two generations and more ago
this would be sheer magic-
works of the devil to many
-but not to all

  for with the dawn of the
age of science came the pro-
phets of science whose visions
carried beyond known facts
some were inventors and in-
vestigators but others like
jules verne and h g wells
wrote science fiction and pre-
dicted with surprising accuracy many of the
wonders that were to come

  a skyscraper must be conceived by the
architect before it can be built by the work-
men imagination conception planning
prevision-all these must come first with-
out them no achievement is possible

  the writers whose works you will find in
the pages of startling stories are
prophets of science a generation or so
hence many of the wonders which they
bring you in the form of fiction will be reali-
ties

penalty-and aftermath

thomas marshall con-

nor was about to die the
droning voice of the prison
chaplain gradually dulled his percep-
tion instead of stimulating his mind
everything was hazy and indistinct
to the condemned man he was going
to the electric chair in just ten min-
utes to pay the supreme penalty be-
cause he had accidentally killed a man
with his bare fists

  connor vibrantly alive vigorous
and healthy only twenty-six a bril-
liant young engineer was going to die
and knowing he did not care but
there was nothing at all nebulous
about the gray stone and cold iron
bars of the death cell there was
nothing uncertain about the split
down his trouser leg and the shaven
spot on his head

 the condemned man was acutely


startling stories

aware of the solidarity of material
things about him the world he was
leaving was concrete and substantial
the approaching footsteps of the
death guard sounded heavily in the
distance

  then the cell door opened and the
chaplain ceased his murmuring pas-
sively thomas marshall connor ac-
cepted his blessings and calmly took
his position between his guards for
his last voluntary walk

  he remained in his state of detach-
ment as they seated him in the chair
strapped his body and fastened the
electrodes he heard the faint rus-
tling of the witnesses and the nervous
rapid scratching of reporters pencils
he could imagine their adjectives-
calloused murderer    brazenly
indifferent to his fate

  but it was as if the matter con-
cerned a third party

  he simply relaxed and waited to
die so quickly and painlessly was more
a relief than anything he was not
even aware when the warden gave his
signal there was a sudden silent
flash of blue light and then-noth-
ing at all



so this was death the slow and
majestic drifting through the
stygian void borne on the ageless
tides of eternity

  peace at last-peace and quiet and
rest

  but what was this sensation like the
glimpse of a faint faraway light
which winked on and off like a star
after an interminable period the light
became fixed and steady a thing of
annoyance thomas marshall connor
slowly became aware of the fact of his
existence as an entity in some un-
known state the senses and memories
that were his personality struggled
weakly to reassemble themselves into
a thinking unity of being-and he be-
came conscious of pain and physical
torture

  there was a sound of shrill voices
and a stir of fresh air he became
aware of his body again he lay quiet
inert exhausted but not as lifeless as

he had lain for-how long

 when the shrill voices sounded
again connor opened unseeing eyes
and stared at the blackness just above
him after a space he began to see but
not to comprehend the blackness be-
came a jagged pebbled roof no more
than twelve inches from his eyes-
rough and unfinished like the under
side of a concrete walk

  the light became a glimmer of day-
light from a point near his right
shoulder

  another sensation crept into his
awareness he was horribly bitterly
cold not with the chill of winter air
but with the terrible frigidity of in-
ter-galactic space yet he was on-
no in earth of some sort it was as if
icy water flowed in his veins instead
of blood yet he felt completely de-
hydrated his body was as inert as
though detached from his brain but
he was cruelly imprisoned within it
he became conscious of a growing re-
sentment of this fact

  then stimulated by the shrilling
piping voices and the patter of tiny
feet out there somewhere to the right
he made a tremendous effort to move
there was a dry withered crackling
sound-like the crumpling of old
parchment-but indubitably his right
arm had lifted

  the exertion left him weak and nau-
seated for a time he lay as in a
stupor then a second effort proved
easier after another timeless inter-
val of struggling torment his legs
yielded reluctant obedience to his
brain again he lay quietly ex-
hausted but gathering strength for
the supreme effort of bursting from
his crypt

  for he knew now where he was he
lay in what remained of his grave
how or why he did not know that
was to be determined

  with all his weak strength he thrust
against the left side of his queer tomb
moving his body against the crevice
at his right only a thin veil of loose
gravel and rubble blocked the way to
the open as his shoulder struck the
pile it gave and slid away outward
and downward in a miniature ava-
lanche
the black flame



 blinding daylight smote connor
like an agony the shrill voices
screamed

   s raoom a childs voice cried
tremulously  s moom again

  connor panted from exertion and
struggled to emerge from his hole
each movement producing another
noise like rattling paper and sud-
denly he was free the last of the
gravel tinkled away and he rolled
abruptly down a small declivity to rest
limply at the bottom of the little hill-
side

he saw now that erosion had cut
through this burial ground-
wherever it was-and had opened a
way for him through the side of his
grave his sight was strangely dim
but he became aware of half a dozen
little figures in a frightened semi-
circle beyond him

  children children in strange mod-
ernistic garb of bright colors but nev-
ertheless human children who stared
at him with wide-open mouths and
popping eyes their curiously cheru-
bic faces were set in masks of horrified
terror

  suddenly recalling the terrors he
had sometimes known in his own
childhood connor was surprised they
did not flee he stretched forth an
imploring hand and made a desperate
effort to speak this was his first
attempt to use his voice and he found
that he could not

  the spell of dread that held the chil-
dren frozen was instantly broken one
of them gave a dismayed cry
a-a-a-h saspecker

  in panic shrieking that cry the
entire group turned and fled they
disappeared around the shoulder of
the eroded hill and connor was left
horribly alone he groaned from the
depths of his despair and was con-
scious of a faint rasping noise through
his cracked and parched lips

  he realized suddenly that he was
quite naked-his shroud had long
since moldered to dust at the same
moment that full comprehension of
what this meant came to him he was
gazing in horror at his body bones
nothing but bones covered with a

dirty parchmentlike skin

  so tightly did his skin cover his
skeletal framework that the very
structure of the bones showed
through he could see the articula-
tion at knuckles knees and toes and
the parchment skin was cracked like
an ancient chinese vase checked like
aged varnish he was a horror from
the tomb and he nearly fainted at the
realization

  after a swooning space he endeav-
ored to arise finding that he could
not he began crawling painfully and
laboriously toward a puddle of water
from the last rain reaching it he
leaned over to place his lips against its
surface reckless of its potability and
sucked in the liquid until a vast roar-
ing filled his ears

 the moment of dizziness passed
he felt somewhat better and his
breathing rasped a bit less painfully
in his moistened throat his eyesight
was slowly clearing and as he leaned
above the little pool he glimpsed the
specter reflected there it looked like
a skull-a face with lips shrunken
away from the teeth so fleshless that
it might have been a deaths head

  oh god he called out aloud and
his voice croaked like that of a sick
raven what and where am i

  in the back of his mind all through
this weird experience there had been
a sense of something strange aside
from his emergence from a tomb in
the form of a living scarecrow he
stared up at the sky

the vault of heaven was blue and
fleecy with the whitest of clouds
the sun was shining as he had never
thought to see it shine again the
grass was green the ground was
normally earthy everything was as
it should be-but there was a strange-
ness about it that frightened him
instinctively he knew that something
was direfully amiss

  it was not the fact that he failed to
recognize his surroundings he had
not had the strength to explore
neither did he know where he had
been buried it was that indefinable
homing instinct possessed in varying
degree by all animate things that

evanie sair

instinct was out of gear his time
sense had stopped with the throwing
of that electric switch-how long ago
somehow lying there under the
warming rays of the sun he felt like
an alien presence in a strange country

  lost he whimpered like a child

  after a long space in which he re-
mained in a sort of stupor he became
aware of the sound of footsteps
dully he looked up a group of men
led by one of the children was ad-
vancing slowly toward him they
wore brightly colored shirts - red
blue violet-and queer baggy trousers
gathered at the ankles in an exotic
style

  with a desperate burst of energy
connor gained his knees he extended
a pleading skeletonlike claw

  help me he croaked in his hoarse
whisper

  the beardless queerly effeminate-
looking men halted and stared at him
in horror

   assim shrilled the childs voice
 s a specker s dead

  one of the men stepped forward
looking from connor to the gaping
hole in the hillside

  wassup he questioned

  connor could only repeat his croak-
ing plea for aid

 esick spoke another man
gravely sleeper eh

  there was a murmur of consultation
among the men with the bright clothes
and oddly soft womanlike voices

 t evanie decided one t
evanie the sorcess

  they closed quickly around the half
reclining connor and lifted him
gently he was conscious of being
borne along the curving cut to a yel-
low country road and then black
oblivion descended once more to claim
him

 when he regained consciousness
the next time he found that he was
within walls reclining on a soft bed
of some kind he had a vague dreamy
impression of a girlish face with
bronze hair and features like raph-
aels angels bending over him some-
thing warm and sweetish like gly-
cerin trickled down his throat

  then to the whispered accompani-
ment of that queerly slurred english
speech he sank into the blissful re-
pose of deep sleep

chapter ii
evanie the sorceress

there were successive intervals
of dream and oblivion of racking
pain and terrible nauseating weak-
ness of voices murmuring queer un-
intelligible words that yet were elu-
sively familiar

  then one day he awoke to the con-
sciousness of a summer morning
birds twittered in the distance chil-
dren shouted clear of mind at last
he lay on a cushioned couch puzzling
over his whereabouts even his iden-
tity for nothing within his vision in-
dicated where or who he was

  the first thing that caught his at-
tention was his own right hand pa-
per-thin incredibly bony it lay like
the hand of death on the rosy cover-
let so transparent that the very color
shone through he could not raise it
only a twitching of the horrible fin-
gers attested its union with his body

  the room itself was utterly unfa-
the black flame



miliar in its almost magnificently
simple furnishings there were
neither pictures nor ornaments only
several chairs of aluminumlike metal
a gleaming silvery table holding a few
ragged old volumes a massive cabinet
against the opposite wall and a chan-
delier pendant by a chain from the
ceiling

  he tried to call out a faint croak
issued

  the response was startlingly imme-
diate a soft voice said hahya in
his ear and he turned his head pain-
fully to face the girl of the bronze
hair seated at his side she smiled
gently

  she was dressed in curious green
baggy trousers gathered at the ankle
and a brilliant green shirt she had
rolled the full sleeves to her shoul-
ders hers was like the costume of
the men who had brought him here

  whahya she said softly

  he understood

 oh im-uh-thomas connor of
course

 thomas connor ocourse she
echoed

  he smiled feebly

  no just thomas connor

  fm ere

  from st louis

  selui s far off

  far off then where was he sud-
denly a fragment of memory returned
the trial-ruth-that catastrophic
episode of the grim chair ruth
the yellow-haired girl he had once
adored who was to have been his wife
-the girl who had coldly sworn his
life away because he had killed the
man she loved

 dimly memory came back of how
he had found her in that other mans
arms on the very eve of their wedding
of his bitter realization that the man
he had called friend had stolen ruth
from him his outraged passions had
flamed the fire had blinded him and
when the ensuing battle had ended the
man had been crumpled on the green
sward of the terrace with a broken
neck

  he had been electrocuted for that
he had been strapped in that chair

  then-then the niche on the hill

thomas connor

but how-how had he by some mir-
acle survived the burning current
he must have-and he still had the
penalty to pay

  he tried desperately to rise

  must leave here he muttered
get away-must get away a new
thought no im legally dead
they cant touch me now no double
jeopardy in this country im safe

voices sounded in the next room
discussing him

  fm selui he say said a mans
voice longo too

  eah said another  s lucky to
live-lucky l be rich

 that meant nothing to him he
raised his hand with a great effort it
glistened in the light with an oil of
some sort it was no longer cracked
and the ghost of a layer of tissue soft-
ened the bones his flesh was grow-
ing back

 his throat felt dry he drew a
breath that ended in a tickling cough

 could i have some water he
asked the girl

  n-n-n she shook her head n
water sm licket

  licket must be liquid he re-
flected he nodded and drank the
mug of thick fluid she held to his lips

he grinned his thanks and she sat
beside him he wandered what sort
of colony was this into which he had
fallen-with their exotic dress and
queer clipped english

  his eyes wandered appreciatively
over his companion even if she were
some sort of foreigner she was glori-
ously beautiful with her bronze hair
gleaming above the emerald costume

  cn talk she said finally as if in
permission

  the question puzzled her
  nonstan she murmured

  i mean-what do you do
sorcy at his mystified look she
amplified it to give strength-to
make well she touched his fleshless
arm

  but thats medicine-a science
not sorcery

  eah science-sorcy s all one
my father evan sair the wizard
taught me her face shadowed  s
dead now then abruptly whes
your money she asked

  he stared why-in st louis in
a bank

  oh she exclaimed n-n-n se-
lui nsafe

 why not he started has
there been another flood of bank-bust-
ings

  the girl looked puzzled

  nsafe she reiterated urbs is
better for very long urbs is better
she paused whend you sleep
why last night

  n-n-n the long sleep

  the long sleep it struck him with
stunning force that his last memories
before that terrible awakening had
been of a september world-and this
was mid-summer a horror gripped
him how long-how long-had he
lain in his-grave weeks no-
months at least

  he shuddered as the girl repeated
gently when

  in september he muttered

  what year

  surprise strengthened him year
nineteen thirty-eight of course
she rose suddenly  s no nine-
teen thirty-eight s only eight forty-
six now

then she was gone nor on her re-
turn would she permit him to talk
the day vanished he slept and an-
other day dawned and passed still
evanie sair refused to allow him to
talk again and the succeeding days
found him fuming and puzzled lit-
tle by little however her strange
clipped english became familiar

  so he lay thinking of his situation
his remarkable escape the miracle that
had somehow softened the discharge
of missouris generators and he
strengthened a day came when
evanie again permitted speech while
he watched her preparing his food

  yonger tom she asked gently
l bea soon he understood she
was saying are you hungry tom
ill be there soon

  he answered with her own affirma-
tive eah and watched her place the
meal in a miraculous cook stove that
could be trusted to prepare it without
burning

  evanie he began how long have
i been here

  three months said evanie you
were very sick

  but how long was i asleep
you ought to know retorted ev-
anie i told you this was eight forty-
six

  he frowned

the year eight forty-six of what
just eight forty-six evanie said
matter of factly of the enlighten-
ment of course what year did you
sleep

  i told you-nineteen thirty-eight
insisted connor perplexed nine-
teen thirty-eight ad

  oh said evanie as if humoring a
child

  then ad she repeated anno
domini that means year of the
master but the master is nowhere
near nineteen hundred years old
connor was nonplussed he and
evanie seemed to be talking at cross-
the black flame



purposes he calmly started again

  listen to me he said grimly
suppose you tell me exactly what
you think i am-all about it just as if
i were a-oh a martian in simple
words

  i know what you are said evanie
youre a sleeper often they wake
with muddled minds

  and what he pursued doggedly
is a sleeper

  surprisingly evanie answered that
in a clear understandable-but most
astonishing-way almost as aston-
ished herself that connor should not
know the answer to his question

  a sleeper she said simply and
connor was now able to understand
her peculiar clipped speech-the
speech of all these people-with com-
parative ease is one of those who un-
dertake electrolepsis that is have
themselves put to sleep for a long term
of years to make money

  how by exhibiting themselves
no she said i mean that those
who want wealth badly enough but
wont spend years working for it un-
dertake the sleep you must remem-
ber that-if you have forgotten so
much else they put their money in
the banks organized for the sleepers
you will remember they guarantee
six percent you see dont you at
that rate a sleepers money increases
three hundred times a century-three
hundred units for each one deposited
six percent doubles their money every
twelve years a thousand becomes a
fortune of three hundred thousand if
the sleeper outlasts a century-and if
he lives

  fairy tales connor said con-
temptuously but now he understood
her question about the whereabouts of
his money when he had first awak-
ened what institution can guaran-
tee six percent with safety what
could they invest in

  they invest in one percent urban
bonds

and run at a loss i suppose
no their profits are enormous-
from the funds of the nine out of
every ten sleepers who fail to waken
slowly i wish-you would tell me
so im a sleeper connor said

the master

the truth

  evanie gazed anxiously down at
him

  electrolepsis often muddles one
she murmured

  im not muddled he yelled i
want truth thats all i want to know
the date

  its the middle of july eight hun-
dred and forty-six evanie said pa-
tiently

  the devil it is perhaps i slept
backward then i want to know what
happened to me

  then suppose you tell evanie
said gently

  i will he cried frantically im
the thomas marshall connor of the
newspapers-or dont you read em
im the man who was tried for murder
and electrocuted tom connor of st
louis-st louis do you under-
stand

evanies gentle features went
suddenly pale

  st louis she whispered st
louis-the ancient name of selui
before the dark centuries-impossi-
ble

  not impossible - true connor
said grimly too painfully true
electrocution evanie whispered
awedly the ancients punishment


startling stories

she stared as if fascinated then cried
excitedly could electrolepsis hap-
pen by accident could it but no
a milliampere too much and brains
destroyed a millivolt too little and
asepsis fails either ways death-
but it has happened if what you are
telling is the truth tom connor you
must have experienced the impossi-
ble

  and what is electrolepsis con-
nor asked desperately calm

  it-its the sleep whispered the
tense girl electrical paralysis of

but only for a century or a very little
more this-this is fantastic you
have slept since before the dark cen-
turies not less than a thousand
years

        chapter iii
        forest meeting

a week-the third since con-
nors awakening to sane thought
had passed he sat on a carved stone
bench before evanies cottage and rev-
eled in the burning canopy of stars
and copper moon he was living if
what he had been told was true-and
he was forced to believe it now-after
untold billions had passed into eter-
nity

  evanie must have been right he
was convinced by her gentle insist-
ence by the queer english on every
tongue by a subtle difference in the
very world about him it wasnt the
same world-quite

  he sighed contentedly breathing
the cool night air he had learned
much of the new age from evanie
though much was still mysteriously
veiled evanie had spoken of the city
of urbs and the master but only
vaguely one day he asked her why

  because - she hesitated - well
because its best for you to form your
own judgments we-the people
around here-are not fond of urbs and
the immortals and i would not like to
influence you tom for in all truth

its the partisans of the master yho
have the best of it not his enemies
urbs is in power it will probably re-
main in power long after our life-
times since it has ruled for seven cen-
turies

  connor looked at the gentle evanie
im sure he said that your side
of the question is mine

  abruptly she withdrew something
from her pocket and passed it to him
he bent over it-a golden disc a coin
he made out the lettering  units
and the figure of a snake circling a
globe its tail in its mouth

  the midgard serpent said ev-
anie i dont know why but thats
what its called

  connor reversed the coin there
was revealed the embossed portrait of
a mans head whose features even in
miniature looked cold austere pow-
erful connor read

  orbis terrarum imperator domi-
nusque urbis

  emperor of the world and master
of the city he translated

 yes that is the master ev-
anies voice was serious as she took the
coin this is the money of urbs to
understand urbs and the master you
must of course know something of his-
tory since your-sleep

  history he repeated

  she nodded since the dark cen-
turies some day one of our patri-
archs will tell you more than i know
for i know little of your mighty an-
cient world it seems to us an incred-
ible age with its vast cities its fierce
nations its inconceivable teeming
populations its terrific energies and
its flaming genius great wars great
industries great art-and then great
wars again

  but you can tell me- connor be-
gan a little impatiently evanie
shook her head

  not now she said quickly for
now i must hasten to friends who will
discuss with me a matter of great mo-
ment perhaps some day you may
learn of that too

  and she was gone before tom con-
nor could say a word to detain her
he was left alone with his thoughts
-clashing devastating thoughts
the black flame



sometimes for there was so much to
be learned in this strange world into
which he had been plunged

  in so many ways it was a strange
new world connor thought as he
watched the girl disappear down the
road that slanted from her hilltop
home to the village from where he
sat on that bench of hewn stone he
could glimpse the village at the foot
of the hill-a group of buildings low
of some white stone all of the struc-
tures were classical with pure doric
columns ormori was the name of the
village evanie had said

  all strange to him not only were
the people so vastly at variance with
those he had known but the physical
world was bewilderingly different

 gazing beyond the village and
bringing his attention back to the hills
and the forests about him tom con-
nor wondered if they too would be
different

  he had to know

the springtime landscape beck-
oned connors strength had re-
turned to such an extent that he arose
from his bench in the sun and headed
toward the green of the forest stretch-
ing away behind evanies home it
was an enchanting prospect he
viewed the trees had the glistening
new green of young foliage and em-
erald green grass waved in the fields
that stretched away down the hillsides
and carpeted the plains

  birds were twittering in the trees as
he entered the forest-birds of all va-
rieties in profusion with gaily-col-
ored plumage their numbers and
fearlessness would have surprised
connor had he not remembered some-
thing evanie had told him urbs she
had said had wiped out objectionable
stinging insects flies corn-worms and
the like centuries ago and the birds
had helped as had certain parasites
that had been bred for the purpose

  they only had to let the birds in-
crease evanie had said by destroy-
ing their chief enemy-the egyptian
cat the house-cat it was acclimat-
ized here and running wild in the
woods so they bred a parasite-the
feliphage-which destroyed it since

then there have been many birds and
fewer insects

  it was pleasant to stroll through
that green forest to that bird orches-
tral accompaniment the spring
breeze touched tom connors face
lightly and for the first time in his
life he knew what it was to stroll in
freedom untouched by the pestifer-
ous annoyance of mosquitoes swarm-
ing gnats and midges or other sting-
ing insects that once had made the
greenwood sometimes akin to purga-
tory

  what a boon to humanity honey
bees buzzed in the dandelions in the
carpeting grass and drank the sweet-
ness from spring flowers but no mites
or flies buzzed about connors uncov-
ered unflung head as he swung along
briskly

  connor did not know how far he
had penetrated into the depths of the
newly green woods when he found
himself following the course of a
small stream its silvery waters
sparkled in the sunlight filtering
through the trees as it moved along
lazily somnolent

  now and then he passed mossy and
viny heaps of stones interesting to
him since he knew from what he had
been told that they were the sole re-
minders of ancient structures erected
before the dark centuries those
heaps of stones had once formed
buildings in another and long-gone
age-his own age

  idly following the little stream he
came at last to a wide bend where the
stream came down from higher
ground to spill in a little splashing
falls

  he had just rounded the bend his
eyes on a clear still pool beyond
when he stopped stockstill his eyes
widening incredulously

  it was as if he were seeing spread
before him a picture well known in
his memory and now brought to ani-
mate life connor had thought him-
self alone in that wood but he was not
sharing it with him there within
short yards of where he stood was the
most beautiful creature on whom he
had ever looked

  it was hard to believe she was a liv-


startling stories

ing breathing being and not a figment
of his imagination no sound had
warned her of his approach and sub-
limely unaware that she was not alone
she held the pose in which connor had
first seen her like some lovely wood
sprite-which she might be in this in-
creasingly astonishing new world

she was on her knees beside the
darkly mirrored pool supported
by the slender arms and hands that
looked alabaster white against the
mossy bank on which she pressed she
was smiling down at her own reflec-
tion in the water-the famous psyche
painting which connor so well re-
membered come to life

  he was afraid to breathe much less
to speak for fear of startling her but
when she turned her head and saw
him she showed no signs of being
startled slowly she smiled and got
gracefully to her feet the clinging
white grecian draperies that swathed
her gently swaying in the breeze to
outline a figure too perfect to be flesh
and blood it was accentuated by the
silver cord that crossed beneath her
breasts as sparkling as her ink-black
hair

  but as she smiled at connor in-
stantly in the depths of her sea-grern
eyes he saw no fear of him but mock-
ery

  i did not know she said in a voice
that held the resonance of a silvery
bell that any weeds ever cared so
much about the beauties of nature to
penetrate so far into the forest

  i am not a weed connor prompt-
ly disclaimed as unconsciously he
took a step or two nearer her he
hoped that she would not vanish at
the sound of his voice or at his ap-
proach i am-

  she stared at him a moment then
laughed and the laughter too was
mocking

  no need to tell me she said airily
i know you are the sleeper who was
recently revived-with the great tale
of having slept a thousand years as
if you were an immortal

  in her laughter her voice was the
lofty intimation that she at least be-
lieved nothing of the sort connor

made no attempt to convince her-not
then he was too enthralled merely
gazing at her

  are you one of the immortals he
asked his own voice awed i have
heard much of them

  there are many things more im-
mortal she said half cryptically
half mockingly than the human to
whom has been given immortality
such immortals know nothing of all
that was known or guessed by the
greeks of long long ages past

  again connor stared at her she
spoke so confidently and she looked
   could it be possible that the gods
and goddesses the sprites of that
long-dead greek age were not legends
after all but living entities could it
be possible that he was gazing on one
now-and that she might vanish at a
touch at a word

  she seemed real enough though
and there was a certain imperiousness
in her manner that was not his idea of
what should be the reaction of any
lovely sprite straight out of the pages
of mythology none of it seemed real
-except her extravagant pulse-warm-
ing beauty

chapter iv
a bit of ancient history

the girls words snapped him out
of his reverie with the confused
knowledge that he was staring at her
inanely as she stood there swaying
slightly like a slender reed while the
gentle breeze whipped her white
gauzy draperies

 come she said peremptorily
come sit beside me here i have
come to the forest to find adventure
that i cannot find elsewhere in a bor-
ing world i have not found it come
you shall amuse me sit here and tell
me this story i have been hearing
about your-sleep

  half-hypnotically connor obeyed
nor did he question why it was all
in a line with the rest that he should
find himself here above the sparkling
dark pool beside this woman-or girl
the black flame



rather since she could be no more
than eighteen-whose beauty was
starkly incredible

 the sun filtering through the
leaves touched her mop of hair so
black that it glinted blue as it fell in
waving cascades below her slender
waist her skin magnolia-tinted
wa all the clearer because of the star-
tling ebony of her hair her beauty
was more than a lack of flaws it was
in true fact goddesslike but sultry
flaming her perfect lips seemed con-
stantly smiling but like the smile in
her emerald eyes it was sardonic
mocking

  for one moment the beauty of this
wood sprite come upon so unexepect-
edly swept all other thoughts from
connors mind even memory of ev-
anie but the next moment evanie
was back filling his thoughts as she
had from the first with her cool un-
derstandable coppery-haired loveli-
ness but even in that moment he
knew that the radiant creature beside
him so different from evanie and
other weed girls he had seen would
forever haunt him whoever what-
ever she might be-human being or
wood goddess

  the girl grew impatient at his si-
lence

  tell me she said imperiously i
have said to you i would be amused
tell me-sleeper

  i am no sleeper-of the type of
which you probably have customarily
heard connor said obedient to her
command whatever has come to me
has been none of my own doing nor
by my wishes it was like this-

  briefly he recited his experience all
that he knew of it making no dramatic
effort he must have been impressive
for as he talked he could see the in-
credulity and mockery pass from her
sea-green eyes to be replaced by re-
luctant belief then astonishment

  it is almost unbelievable she said
softly when he had finished but i
do believe you her marvelous eyes
held a far-away expression if in
your memory you have retained
knowledge of your own ancien times
great things await you in this age to
which you have come

 but i know nothing about this
age connor quickly complained i
glean snatches of this and that of
some mysterious immortals who seem
to reign supreme of many things alien
to me and my understanding but so
far i have not been able to learn much
about this age no nor do i even
know anything of the history of the
ages that have passed while i was-
sleeping

connors wood sprite looked
hard at him a moment admira-
tion for him plain in her low-lidded
glance the mockery flickered a mo-
ment in her eyes then died

  shall i tell you she asked we
of the woods and valleys know many
things we learn as the cycles of
years go by but not always do we
pass our knowledge along

  please begged connor please
tell me-everything i am lost

  she seemed a little uncertain where
to begin then suddenly started to talk
as if giving an all-inclusive lesson in
history from the beginning of time

  you of the ancient world had great
cities she said today there are
mighty cities too nyork had eight
millions of people urbs the great
metropolis of this age has thirty mil-
lions but where there is now one
metropolis your world had a hundred
a marvelous age that time of yours
but it ended some time in your
twentieth century it went out in a
blaze of war

 the twentieth century ex-
claimed connor so near my time
yes your fierce warlike nations
sated their lust for battle at last in
one gigantic war that spread like a
cloud around the planet they fought
by sea by land by air and beneath sea
and land they fought with weapons
whose secrets are still lost with
strange chemistries with diseases
every nation was caught in the strug-
gle  all their vast knowledge went into
it and city after giant city was de-
stroyed by atomic bombs or annihi-
lated by infected water supplies
famine stalked the world and after it
swept swift pestilence

  but by the fiftieth year after the


startling stories

war the world had reached a sort of
stability then came barbarism the
old nations had fallen and in their
place came numberless little city-
states little farming communities
each sufficient to itself weaving its
own cloth raising its own food and
then the language began to change
why asked connor children
speak like their parents

  not exactly said the wood sprite
with a slow smile language evolves
by laws heres one consonants tend
to move forward in the mouth as lan-
guages age take the word mother
in the ancient tokhar it was makar
then the latin mater then madre
then mother and now our modern
word muvver do you see k-t-
d-th-v-each sound a little ad-
vanced in the throat the ultimate of
course is mama-pure labial sounds
which proves only that its the oldest
word in the world

  i see said connor

  well once it was released from
the bonds of printing language
changed it became difficult to read
the old books and then the books be-
gan to vanish fire gutted the aban-
doned cities the robber bands that
lurked there burned books by winter
for warmth worms and decay ruined
them precious knowledge vanished
some of it forever

she paused a moment watching
connor keenly do you see
now she asked why i said greatness
awaits you if you retain any of your
ancient knowledge

  possibly said connor but go
on please

  other factors too were at work
she said nodding in the first place
a group of small city-states seems to
be the best environment for genius
that was the situation in greece dur-
ing the golden age in italy during
the renaissance and all over the
world before the second enlighten-
ment

  then too a period of barbarism
seems to act as a time of rest for hu-
manity before a charge to new heights
the stone age flared suddenly into
the light of egypt persia decayed and

greece flowered and the middle ages
awoke to the glory of the renaissance
so the dark centuries began to flame
into the brilliant age of the second
enlightenment the fourth great dawn
in human history

  it began quietly enough about two
centuries after the war a young
man named john holland drifted into
the village of norleans that sprawled
beside the ancient citys ruins he
found the remnants of a library and
he was one of those rare ones who
could read he studied alone at first
but soon others joined him and the
academy was born

  the townspeople thought the stu-
dents wizards and sorcerers but as
knowledge grew the words wizard and
sorcerer became synonyms for what
your age called scientists

  i see muttered connor and he
was thinking of evanie the sorceress
i see

  norleans said his own charming
enlightener became the center of the
enlightment and played athens to
the world holland died but the
academy lived and one day a young
student named teran had a vision
some of the ancient knowledge had
by now yielded its secrets and terans
vision was to recondition the centur-
ies-old norleans power plants and
water systems-to give the city its
utilities

  that there was no power no coal
no oil didnt stop him he and his
group scraped and filed and welded
away at the ancient machines firmly
believing that when power was
needed it would be there

  he was right it was the gift of
an old man named einar olin who
had wandered over the continent seek-
ing-and finding-the last and great-
est achievement of the ancients
atomic energy norleans became a
miracle city where wheels turned and
lights glowed across plains and
mountains came hundreds just to see
the great city and among these were
three on whom history turned

  these were sandy-haired martin
sair and black-haired joaquin smith
and his sister some have called her
satanicajly beautiful the black

startling stories

flame they call her now-have you
heard

  connor shook his head his eyes
drinking in the beauty of this woman
of the woods who fascinated him as
he had never believed possible

 for a moment the mocking glint
came back in the girls eyes then in-
stantly it was gone as she shrugged
her white shoulders and went on

 those three changed the whole
course of history martin sair turned
to biology and medicine when he
joined the half-monastic academy
and his genius added the first new dis-
covery to add to the knowledge of the
ancients studying evolution experi-
menting with hard radiations he
found sterility then-immortality

  joaquin smith found his field in
the neglected social sciences govern-
ment economics psychology he too
had a dream-of rebuilding the old
world he was-or is-a colossal
genius he took martin sairs immor-
tality and traded it for power he
traded immortality to jorgensen for
a rocket that flew on the atomic blast
to kohlmar for a weapon to erden for
the erden resonator that explodes
gunpowder miles away and then he
gathered his army and marched

  war again connor said tightly
i should have thought they would
have had enough

but the girl did not heed him in
her emerald eyes was a light as
if she were seeing visions herself-
visions of glorious conquest

  norleans she said directly in
the light of joaquin smiths magnetic
personality yielded gladly other
cities yielded almost as if fascinated
while those who fought were over-
come what chance had rifle and ar-
row against the flying triangles of
jorgensen or kohlmars ionic beams
and joaquin smith himself was-
well magnificent even the wives of
the slain cheered him when he com-
forted them in that noble manner of
his

 america was conquered within
sixty years immortality gave smith
the master power and no one save
martin sair and those he taught has

ever been able to learn its secret
thousands have tried many have
claimed success but the results of
their failures still haunt the world

  and-well joaquin smith has his
world empire now not america
alone he has bred out criminals and
the feeble-minded he has impressed
his native english on every tongue he
has built urbs the vast glittering
brilliant wicked world capital and
there he rules with his sister mar-
garet of urbs beside him yet-

  i should think this world he con-
quered would worship him ex-
claimed connor

 worship him cried the girl
too many hate him in spite of all he
has done not only for this age but for
ages gone-since the enlightenment
he-

  but tom connor was no longer lis-
tening all his thoughts his atten-
tion his eyes that drank in her beauty
were on the girl so lovely-and to
have so much wisdom stored up in the
brain beneath the sheen of that black-
satiny cap that was her hair there
could only be one answer to that she
must be a goddess come to life

  he ached to touch her to touch only
the hem of her gauzy garment but
that must not be his heart pounded
at the very nearness of her-but it was
with a worship that could have thrown
him prostrate at her feet

  its all like a dream what youve
told me he said his voice far-away
musing youre a dream

  the dancing light of mockery came
back into her sea-green eyes

  shall we leave it a dream-this
meeting of ours she asked softly
she laid one white hand lightly on his
arm and he thrilled at the touch as
though an electric current had shot
through him-but not a painful anni-
hilating one now man of the an-
cients she said will you give me a
promise

 anything - anything connor
said eagerly

 then promise me you will say
nothing not even to the weed girl
who is called evanie the sorceress
about having seen me this morning
no slightest hint
the black flame



for a moment connor hesitated
would it be disloyalty to evanie
in any way to make that promise
he did not know what he did know
was that it fell in with his own ideas
to keep this meeting a secret-like
something sacred something to hold
as a memory deep within his own heart
only

  promise she repeated in that
silvery-bell voice

 connor nodded i promise he
said soberly but tell me will i see
you again will you-

  suddenly the girl leaped lightly to
her feet startled as she stood listen-
ing like the faun she probably was
her astonishing emerald eyes were
wide as she poised for flight dimly
the entranced connor became aware
of voices back in the woods men were
probably coming to seek him knowing
how sick he had been

  i must flee the girl whispered
quickly but man of the ancients
we shall meet again that is my
promise keep yours

  and then before he could speak she
had whirled like a butterfly in flight
and was speeding through the woods
on noiseless feet connor caught one
last glimpse of her fluttering white
draperies against the brown and green
of tree trunks and leaves then she was
gone

  he passed a hand slowly before his
bewildered eyes a dream it must
be but she had promised they would
meet again when

chapter v
the village

days slipped imperceptibly by
connor had almost regained his
full strength time and again when-
ever he could do so unobserved he
slipped away to the woods alone but
never again did he catch sight of the
wood nymph who had so deeply fasci-
nated him gradually he came to per-
suade himself that the whole incident
had been a dream many things as
strange had happened to him since his

strange awakening only one thing
gave it the semblance of reality-the
knowledge he had gleaned from the
inky-haired girl of mystery a knowl-
edge later confirmed when he began
to enter the peaceful life of the vil-
lage

  aside from evanie however he had
but one other close friend he had
taken at once to jan orm engineer
and operator of the village of ormons
single factory on the hill

  the factory was a perpetual sur-
prise to connor the incredibly ver-
satile machines made nearly every-
thing except the heavier mechanisms
used in the fields and these he
learned could have been made that
was not necessary since the completed
machines could as easily be trans-
ported as the steel necessary to con-
struct them

  the atomic power amazed tom con-
nor the motors burned only water
or rather the hydrogen in it and the
energy was the product of synthesis
rather than disintegration four hy-
drogen atoms with their weight of
 combined into one helium atom
with a weight of  somewhere had
disappeared the difference of  and
this was the source of that abundant
energy - matter being destroyed
weight transformed to energy

  there was a whole series of atomic
furnaces too the release of energy
was a process of one degree like ra-
dium once started neither tempera-
ture nor pressure could speed or slow
it in the least but the hydrogen
burned steadily into helium at the
uniform rate of half its mass in three
hundred days

  jan orm was proud of the plant

   neat isnt it he asked connor
one of the type called omnifac
make anything theres thousands of
em about the country practically
make each town independent self-
sustaining we dont need your an-
cient cumbersome railroad system to
transport coal and ore

  how about the metal you use

  nor metal either jan said just
as there was a stone age a bronze age
and an iron age just as history calls
your time the age of steel were in


startling stories

the aluminum age and aluminums
everywhere its the base of all clays
almost eight per cent of the earths
crust

  i know its there grunted connor
it used to cost too much to get it out
of clay

  well power costs nothing now
waters free his face darkened
moodily if we could only control
the rate but power comes out at al-
ways the same rate-a half period of
three hundred days if we could
build rockets-like the triangles of
urbs the natural rate is just too
slow to lift its own weight the power
from a pound of water comes out too
gradually to raise a one-pound mass
the urbans know how to increase
the rate to make the water deliver
half its energy in a hundred days-
ten days

  and if you could build rockets
then said jan growing even
moodier then wed- he paused
abruptly we can detonate it he
said in a changed voice we can get
all the energy in one terrific blast but
thats useless for a rocket

  why cant you use a firing cham-
ber and explode say a gram of water
at a time connor asked a rapid
series of little explosions should be
just as effective as a continuous blast
my father tried that jan orm
said grimly hes buried at the bend
of the river

w ater connor asked evanie why
m-a jan was so anxious to develop
atom-powered rockets the girl
turned suddenly serious eyes on him
but made no direct reply

  the immortals guard the secret of
the triangle was all she said its
a military secret

 but what could he do with a
rocket

  she shook her glistening hair
  nothing perhaps

  evanie he said soberly i dont
like to feel that you wont trust me

i	know from what youve said that
youre somehow opposed to the gov-
ernment well ill help you if i can
-but i cant if you keep me in igno-
rance

  the girl was silent

  and another thing he proceeded
this immortality process ive heard
somebody say that the results of its
failures when some tried it still haunt
the world why evanie

  swiftly a crimson flush spread over
the girls cheeks and throat

  now what the devil have i said
he cried evanie i swear i wouldnt
hurt you for the world

  dont she only murmured turn-
ing silently away

  he too was hurt because she was
he knew he owed his life to her for
her treatments and hospitality it
disturbed him to think he knew of no
way in which to repay her but he
was dubious of his ability to earn
much as an engineer in this world of
strange devices

  id have to start right at the bot-
tom he observed ruefully to evanie
when he spoke of that later

  in urbs evanie said youd be
worth your weight in radium as a
source of ancient knowledge so
much has been lost so much is gone
perhaps forever often we have only
the record of a great mans name and
no trace of his work of these is a
man named einstein and another
named de sitter-men acknowledged
to be supreme geniuses of science even
by the supreme scientists of your age
their work is lost

  im afraid it will remain lost
then he said whimsically both
einstein and de sitter were contem-
poraries of mine but i wasnt up to
understanding their theories all i
know is that they dealt with space and
time and a supposed curvature of
space - relativity the theory was
called

  but thats exactly the clue theyd
want in urbs exclaimed evanie her
eyes shining thats all theyd need
and think of what you could tell them
of ancient literature we havent the
artists and writers you had-not yet
the plays of a man named shakes-
peare are still the most popular of all
on the vision broadcasts i always
watch them she looked up wistfully
was he also a contemporary of
yours and did you know a philoso-
the black flame



urbs minor slipped smoothly into the range of vision chapter xix

pher named aristotle

 connor laughed

  i missed the one by three centuries
and the other by twenty-five he
chuckled

  im sorry said the girl flushing
red i dont know much of history

     e smiled warmly

     if i thought i could actually
earn something-if i could pay you
for all the trouble ive been id go to
this city of urbs for awhile-and then
come back here id like to pay you

 pay me she asked in surprise
we dont use money here except for
taxes

  the taxes

 yes the urban taxes they come
each year to collect and it must be
paid in money she frowned angrily
i hate urbs and all it stands for i
hate it

 are the taxes so oppressively
high

 oppressive she retorted any
tax is oppressive its a difference in

degree thats all as long as a gov-
ernment has the right to tax the po-
tential injustice is there and what
of other rights the master arrogates to
himself she paused as if to let the
full enormity of that strike in

  well he said carelessly thats
been a privilege granted to the heads
of many governments hasnt it

  her eyes blazed i cant under-
stand a man whos willing to surrender
his natural rights  she flared our
men would die for a principle

  but theyre not doing it observed
connor caustically

  because theyd be throwing their
lives away uselessly-thats why
they cant fight the master now with
any chance of success but just wait
until the time comes

  and then i suppose the whole
world will be just one great big beau-
tiful state of anarchy

  and isnt that an ideal worth fight-
ing for asked the girl hotly to
permit every single individual to at-
tain his rightful liberty to destroy


startling stories

every chance of injustice

 but-

  connor paused considering why
should he be arguing like this with
evanie he felt no allegiance to the
government of urbs the master
meant nothing to him the only gov-
ernment he could have fought for
died for was lost a thousand years in
the past whatever loyalty he owed
in this topsy-turvy age belonged to
evanie he grinned crazy or not
evanie he promised your cause is
mine

  she softened suddenly

  thank you tom then in lower
tones now you know why jan orm
is so anxious for the secret of the
rocket blast do you see her voice
dropped to a whisper revolution
he nodded i guessed that but
since youve answered one question
perhaps youll answer my other one
what are the failures that still haunt
the world the products of the immor-
tality treatment

  again that flush of unhappiness
he meant-the metamorphs she
murmured softly

  quickly she rose and passed into the
cottage

       chapter vi
       the metamorphs

connors strength swiftly ap-
proached normal and shortly lit-
tle remained of that unbelievable so-
journ in the grave his months griz-
zle of beard began to be irritating and
one day he asked jan for a razor

  jan seemed puzzled at connors ex-
planation he laughed and produced a
jar of salve that quickly dissolved the
stubble assuring connor that the
preparation would soon destroy the
growth entirely

  but evanies reaction surprised
him she stared for a moment with-
out recognition

  tom she cried you look-you
look like an ancient statue

  he did look different from the mild-
featured villagers with the beard

removed his lean face had an aura of
strength and ruggedness that was
quite unlike the appearance of his
neighbors

  time slipped pleasantly away eve-
nings he spent talking to newly made
friendsrelating storiesof his dead age
explaining the state of politics soci-
ety and science in that forgotten time
often evanie joined in the conversa-
tion though at other times she amused
herself at the vision a device of re-
markable perfection on whose two-
foot screen actors in distant cities
spoke and moved with the naturalness
of miniature life

 connor himself saw winters
tale and henry the eighth given
in accurate portrayal and was once
surprised to discover a familiar-seem-
ing musical comedy complete to scant-
ily-clad chorus in many ways ev-
anie puzzled tom connor there was
some mystery about her that he could
not understand life in ormon it
seemed to him was essentially what it
had been in his old days in st louis
young men still followed immemorial
routine each evening saw them walk-
ing sitting talking with girls idling
through the parklike arcades of trees
strolling along the quiet river

 but not evanie no youth ever
climbed the hill to her cottage or sat
with her at evening-except when jan
orm occasionally came and this
seemed strange considering the girls
loveliness connor couldnt remember
a more attractive girl than this spir-
ited gentle demure evanie-except
his girl of the woods not even ruth
of the buried days of the past

  he mused over the matter until a
more sensational mystery effaced it

 one morning he and jan orm and
evanie went hunting game up-river
deer were fairly plentiful and game-
birds wild turkeys and pheasants had
increased until they were nearly as
common as crows once had been

  the trio carried glistening bows of
spring steel that flung slender steel
arrows with deadly accuracy if used
properly connor was awkward but
evanie and jan orm handled them
with skill connor bemoaned the lack
of rifles he had been a fair marksman
the black flame



in the old days

  id show you he declared if i
only had my marlin repeater

  guns arent made any more said
jan the erden resonator did for
them theyre useless for military
weapons

jut for hunting

 jtp theyre banned by law
for awhile after the founding of the
urban empire people kept em hidden
around but no one knew when a res-
onator might sweep the section and
folks got tired of having the things go
off at night smashing windows and
plowing walls they werent safe
house-pets

  well grumbled connor id like
one now even an air-rifle say he
exclaimed why not a water-gun
a water-gun

  one run by atomic energy didnt
you say you could detonate it-get all
the power out at once

  yes but- jan orm paused by
god he roared thats the answer
thats the weapon why didnt any-
body think of that before theres
what we need to- he broke his sen-
tence in mid-air

  evanie smiled its all right she
said tom knows

  yes said connor and im with
you in your revolutionary ambitions
im glad jan orm said simply
his eyes lighted that gun its a
stroke of genius the resonators cant
damage an atom-powered rifle ev-
anie the time draws near

  the three proceeded thoughtfully
up the river bank the midsummer
sun beat down upon them with wither-
ing intensity connor mopped his
streaming brow

  how id like a swim he ejacu-
lated evanie do you people ever
swim here that place where the riv-
ers backed up by that fallen bridge-
it should be a great place for a dip
oh no the girl said quickly
why should we swim you can
bathe every day in the pool at home
that was true the six-foot basin
where water warmed to a pleasant
tepidity by atomic heat bubbled
steadily though was always avail-

able but it was a poor substitute for
swimming in open water

  that little lake looked tempting
connor sighed

  the lake cried evanie in horror
oh no no you cant swim there
why not

  you just cant

  and that was as much information
as he could obtain shortly afterward
swinging the half-dozen birds that
had fallen to their arrows they started
back for the village

but connor was determined to
ferret out at least that one mys-
tery-why he should not swim in the
lake the next time he accompanied
jan orm on a tramp up-river he plied
jan with questions but it was futile
he could extract no more from jan
orm than he had from evanie

  as the pair approached the place of
the ruined bridge that damned the
stream they turned a little ways in-
land jans keen eyes spotted a move-
ment in a thick copse

  deer in there he whispered
lets separate and start him

  he bore off to the left and connor
creeping cautiously to the right ap-
proached the grass-grown marge of
the flowage suddenly he stopped
short ahead of him the sun had
glinted on something large and brown
and wet and he heard a rustle of
movement he moved stealthily for-
ward  with utmost care he separated a
screen of brush and gazed through it
to a little open glade and on the cre-
ature that sprawled there beside the
water

at first he saw only a five-foot
strip of wet hairless oily skin
that heaved to the things slow breath-
ing he held his bow ready lest it
prove dangerous and stared wonder-
ing what sort of creature it could be
it was certainly nothing native to the
north america of his day and then
at some sound or movement of his the
beast rolled over and faced him

  connor felt sick he glimpsed
short incredibly thick limbs great
splay feet with webbed toes broad
hands with webbed fingers but what


startling stories

sickened him was the smooth bulbous
face with its tiny eyes and little round
red-lipped mouth

  the thing was or had been human

  connor let out a choking yell the
creature with a mumble that might
have been speech flopped awkwardly
to the bank and into the water where
it cleaved the element like an otter and
disappeared with a long silent wake

  he heard the crashing of jan orms
approach and his cry of inquiry but
a webbed print in the mud of the bank
told jan orm the story

  wh-what was it connor choked

  a metamorph said jan soberly

 empty-handed as they were he
turned homeward connor too aghast
to press questions followed him and
then came the second mystery

  connor saw it first-a face a childs
face peering at them from a leafy cov-
ert but this was no human child
speechless connor saw the small
pointed ears that twitcjied the
pointed teeth the little black slanting
eyes squinting at him beadily the
face was that of a young satyr a child
of pan it was the spirit of the wil-
derness incarnate not evil exactly not
even savage but just wild-wild

 the imp vanished instantly as
connor gasped whats that it
was already far beyond arrow-shot
headed for the forest jan viewed it
without surprise

  its a young metamorph he said
a different sort than the one at the
lake he paused and stared steadily
into connors eyes

  promise me something he mut-
tered

 what

  that youll not tell evanie you saw
these things

  if you wish said connor slowly
it was all beyond him

chapter vii
panate blood

but tom connor was determined
now to fathom these mysteries
jan should no longer put him off he

stopped and placed a hand firmly on
jans arm forced the man to look into
his eyes when jan would have evaded
his gaze

  just what he said bluntly is a
metamorph you must tell me jan
there was a moments uncomfort-
able silence

 that question has been evaded
long enough connor said firmly
and i intend to know why this is
my world now ive got to live in it
and i want to know what others know
of it-its faults as well as its virtues
why have you shunned the question
because-because-

  because of evanie supplied con-
nor

  yes jan agreed reluctantly be-
cause of evanie

  what has that monster at the lake
to do with her

 nothing directly jan orm
paused before i tell you more tom
im going to ask you something do
you love evanie

  im very fond of her

  but do you love her jan insisted
yes said connor suddenly i
do

  a swift thought had come to him
before he had reached that decision
the vision of a smiling wood nymph
was before his eyes but only a hu-
man being could be loved by a man-
a coolly lovely girl like evanie not a
goddess	

  why do the youths of ormon ig-
nore evanie so jan connor asked
abruptly shes far the loveliest girl
in town

  so she is tom its her own doing
that they ignore her they hae tried
to be friends with her-have tried
hard but she-well she has always
discouraged them

 why

  because i think she feels that in
justice to everybody she cant marry
and again why

  for a long moment jan orm hesi-
tated til tell you he decided final-
ly tom shes one-eighth meta-
morph

 what

  yes her mother was the daughter
of montmerci the anadominist a
the black flame



great man but half metamorph

 do you mean asked conner
aghast that she has the blood of that
lake monster in her

  no ohno there are two kinds
of metamorphs one sort the panate
metamorph is human the others the
amphimorphs are just-horrors ev-
anies blood is panate but she has
conquered her metamorphic heredity
a metamorph connor groaned

the picture of that flopping horror
rose in his mind and then the vis-
ion of the wild impish face of the
woods child there was something
reminiscent of evanie in that the
color of her bronze hair an occasional
glint in her deep eyes

  tell me he said huskily about
that heredity of hers might her child
for instance turn wild or turn into
such a horror as an-amphimorph
jan orm smiled

  by no chance the panate meta-
morphs i tell you are human theyre
people theyre much like us-good
and bad brilliant and stupid and
many of them surpassingly beautiful
in their wild way

  but just what are they whered
they come from

  do you remember hearing martin
sair mentioned he was companion
of the master evanies great-uncle
thirty generations removed

  the discoverer of immortality i
remember

  but connor made no mention of
when he had first heard of both martin
sair and the master-from an uncan-
nily beautiful wood sprite who had
seemed to possess all the wisdom of
the ages

  yes jan told him and you
must have heard too that there were
other attempts at making men immor-
tal in the first century of the en-
lightenment and failures some that
still haunt the world well the meta-
morphs are those failures

  i see said connor slowly
theyre a mutation an artificial
mutation jan explained when
martin sairs discovery became
known thousands sought to imi-
tate him it was understood that

the messenger launched itself at his head
chapter xii


startling stories

he was working with hard radiations
but just what was a mystery-whether
as hard as the cosmic rays or as soft
as the harder x-rays nevertheless
many charlatans claimed to be able to
give immortality and there were
thousands of eager victims it was a
mania a wave of lunacy the labora-
tories ci the tricksters were packed

  there were four directions of error
to be made those who had not sairs
secret erred in all four people
who were treated with too hard radia-
tions died those treated with too soft
rays simply became sterile those
treated with the right rays but for too
long a time remained themselves un-
changed but bore amphimorphs as
children those treated for too short
a time bore panate metamorphs

  can you imagine the turmoil in a
world just emerging from barbarism
still disorganized of course some of
the freaks survived near the sea
coasts amphimorphs began to appear
and in lakes and rivers while in the
hills and forests the children of na-
ture the panate type went trouping
through the wilderness

 but why werent they extermi-
nated asked connor tensely
youve bred out criminals why let
these creatures exist

  criminals could be reached and
sterilized its impossible to sterilize
beings who slip into the sea at ones
approach or who fade like shadows
into the depths of a forest

then why not kill them off
would you favor such a measure
no connor said adding in impas-
sioned tone it would be nothing less
than murder even to kill the swim-
mers are they-intelligent

 in a dim fashion the amphi-
morphs are creatures cast back to the
amphibious stage of the human embryo
-just above the gilled period the
others the panates are strange ex-
cept for an odd claustrophobia the
fear of enclosed things-of houses or
clothing-theyre quite as intelligent
as most of us and theyre compara-
tively harmless

connor heaved a sigh of relief
then they arent a problem

  oh there were consequencesr
jan said wryly their women are
often very beautiful like the marble
figures of nymphs dug up in europe
there have been many cases like eva-
nies many of us may have a drop
or so of metamorphic blood but it
falls hardest on the first offspring the
hybrids miserable creatures unable to
endure civilized life and often most
unhappy in the wilds yet even these
occasionally produce a genius eva-
nies grandfather is one

  what did he do

  he was known as montmerci the
anodominist half human half meta-
morph yet his was a powerful per-
sonality he was strong enough to
lead an abortive revolution against the
master both humans and meta-
morphs followed him he even man-
aged to direct a group of amphi-
morphs who got into the citys water
supply and erupted into the sewers by
hundreds

  but what happened to the revolu-
tion

  it was quickly suppressed jan
said bitterly what could a horde
armed with bows and knives do
against the rings and ionic beams of
urbs

 and montmerci

  he was executed-a rare punish-
ment but the master realized the
danger from this wild metamorph a
second attempt might have been suc-
cessful thats why evanie hates
urbs so intensely

  evanie connor said musingly
tell me what was it that led to her
fathers marrying a-a-

  a cross well evan sair was like
evanie a doctor he came upon meria
the daughter of montmerci down in
the mountain region called ozarky
he found her there sick just after the
collapse of the uprising so evan sair
cared for her and fell in love with her
he brought her here to his home and
married her but she soon began to
weaken again from lack of the opfen
woods and sunlight

  she died when evanie was born
but she would have died anyway
jan orm paused and drew a long
breath now do you see why
the black flame



evanie fears her own blood why
she has driven away the youths who
tried to arouse even friendship shes
afraid of the sleeping metamorphic
nature in her and needlessly afraid
since shes safely human she has
even tried to drive me away but i re-
fuse to be so driven i understand
so do i said connor soberly
and im going to marry her

jan orm smiled dryly and if
she thinks otherwise

 then i must convince her

  jan shook his head in mild wonder-
ment perhaps you can he said
with the barest hint of reluctance
theres something dynamic about
you in some ways youre like the im-
mortals of urbs

  when they reached the village con-
nor left jan orm and trudged in a
deep reverie up evanies hill musing
on the curious revelations he had
heard analyzing his own feelings did
he really love the bronze-haired
evanie the query had never pre-
sented itself until jan had put it to
him so bluntly yet now he was cer-
tain he did admitting that then-
had he the right to ask her to marry
a survival of the past a revivified
mummy a sort of living fossil

 what damage might that millenium
of sleep have done him might he not
awake some morning to find the

weight of his years suddenly upon
him might he not disintegrate like
a veritable mummy when its wrap-
pings were removed still he had
never felt stronger or healthier in his
life and was he such a freak after
all in this world of immortals satyrs
and half-human swimmers

  he paused at the door of the cottage
peering within the miraculous cook-
stove hissed quietly and evanie was
humming to herself as she stood be-
fore a mirror brushing the shining
metal of her hair she glimpsed him
instantly and whirled he strode for-
ward and caught her hands

  evanie- he began and paused as
she jerked violently to release herself

  please go out she said

  he held her wrists firmly evanie
youve got to listen to me i love you

 i know those arent the right
words he stumbled on its just-
the best i can do

  i dont-permit this she mur-
mured

  i know you dont but-evanie i
mean it

  he tried to draw her closer but she
stood stiffly while he slipped his arms
about her by sheer strength he tilted
her head back and kissed her

 for a moment he felt her relax
against him then she had thrust him
away

  please she gasped you cant

startling stories

you dont-understand

  i do he said gently

  then you see how impossible it is
for me to-marry

  any wildness in any children of
ours he sfiid with a smile might as
easily come of the connor blood

  for a long moment evanie lay pas-
sive in his arms and then when she
struggled away he was startled to see
tears

  tom she whispered if i say i
love you will you promise me some-
thing

  you know i will

  then promise youll not mention
love again nor try to kiss me nor even
touch me-for a month after that ill
-ill do as you wish do you prom-
ise

 of course but why evanie
why

  because within a month she mur-
mured tensely therell be war

       chapter viii
       in time of peace

connor held strictly to his word
with evanie but the change in
their relationship was apparent to
both of them evanie no longer met
his gaze with frank steadiness her
eyes would drop when they met his
and she would lose the thread of her
sentences in confusion

  yet when he turned unexpectedly
he always found her watching him
with a mixture of abstractedness and
speculation and once or twice he
awakened in the morning to find her
gazing at him from the doorway with
a tender wistful smile

  one afternoon jan orm hailed him
from the foot of evanies hill

  ive something to show you he
called and connor rose from his com-
fortable sprawl in the shade and
joined him walking toward the fac-
tory across the village

  ive been thinking jan connor
remarked frankly i cant yet un-
derstand why you consider the master
such a despicable tyrant ive yet to

hear of any really tyrannous act of
his

  he isnt a tyrant jan said gloom-
ily i wish he were then our revo-
lution would be simple almost every-
body would be on our side its evi-
dence of his ability that he avoids any
misgovernment and keeps the greater
part of the people satisfied hes just
kind and benevolent-on the sur-
face

  what makes you think hes differ-
ent underneath

  he retains the one secret wed all
like to possess-the secret of immor-
tality isnt that evidence enough that
hes supremely selfish he and his
two or three million immortals-sole
rulers of the earth

  two or three million

  yes whats the difference how
many theyre still ruling half a bil-
lion people-a small percentage ruling
the many if hes so benevolent why
doesnt he grant others the privilege
of immortality

  thats a fair question said con-
nor slowly pondering anyway
im on your side jan youre my peo-
ple now i owe you all my allegiance
they entered the factory and now
-what was it you brought me here to
see

  jans face brightened

  ah he exclaimed have a look
at this

  he brought forth an object from a
desk drawer in his office passing it
pridefully to connor it was a blunt
thick-handled blue steel revolver

 atom-powered jan glowed
heres the magazine

  he shook a dozen little leaden balls
each the size of his little fingernail
into his palm

  no need of a cartridge of course
commented connor water in the
handle    i thought so but heres
one mistake you dont want your pro-
jectiles round you lose range and ac-
curacy make em cylindrical and
blunt-pointed he squinted through
the weapons barrel and-theres
no rifling

  he explained the purpose of rifling
the barrel to give the bullet a rotary
motion
the black flame



  i might have known enough to con-
sult you first jan orm said wryly
want to try it out anyway i havent
been able to hit much with it so far

they moved through the whirring
factory at the rear the door
opened upon a slope away from the
village the ground slanted gently
toward the river glancing about for
a suitable target connor seized an
empty can from a bench within the
door and flung it as far as he could
down the slope he raised the revolv-
er and suddenly perceived another
imperfection that had escaped his no-
tice

  there are no sights on it he
ejaculated

  sights jan was puzzled

  to aim by he explained the prin-
ciple well lets try it as is

  he squinted down the smooth bar-
rel squeezed the trigger there was
a sharp report his arm snapped back
to a terrific recoil and the can leaped
spinning high into the air to fall yards
farther toward the river

 wow he exclaimed what a
kick

  but jan was leaping with enthusi-
asm

  you hit it you hit it

  yeah but it hit back connor said
ruefully while youre making the
other changes lighten the charge a lit-
tle else youll have broken wrists in
your army and id set somebody to
work on ordnance and rifles theyre
a lot more useful than revolvers at
jans nod he asked you dont expect
to equip the whole revolution with the
products of this one factory do you
of course not there are thou-
sands like it in villages like ormon
ive already sent descriptions of the
weapons well need ill have to cor-
rect them

  how many men can you count on
altogether i mean

 we should muster twenty-five
thousand

  twenty-five thousand for a world
revolution an even twenty-five
thousand to attack a city of thirty mil-
lion

  dont forget that the city is all that

counts who holds urbs holds the
world

  but still-a city that size or
even just the three million immortals
well be overwhelmed

  i dont think so jan said grimly
dont forget that in urbs are several
million anadominists i count on them
to join us in fact im planning to
smuggle arms to them provided our
weapons are successful they wont
be as effective as the ionic beam but
-we can only try well have at least
the advantage of surprise since we
dont plan to muster and march on
urbs well infiltrate slowly and on
the given day at the given hour well
strike

  therell be street fighting then
connor said theres nothing like
machine-guns for that

  what are they

jans eyes glowed as connor ex-
plained

  we can manage those he decided
that should put us on a par with the
urban troops so long as we remain in
the city where the air forces cant help
them if only we had aircraft

  therere airplanes such as my gen-
eration used

  too flimsy useless against the
fliers of urbs no what we need is
the secret of the rocket blast and
since thats unobtainable well have
to do without well manage to keep
our fighting in the city itself and
how well need you

  connor soon came to realize the
truth of jans words what little he
knew of trajectories velocities and
the science of ballistics was taxed to
the uttermost he was astounded to
discover that calculus was a lost
knowledge and that jan was even un-
acquainted with the use of logarithms
and the slide rule

  rather than plod through hours and
hours of mathematical computation it
seemed to connor the shorter method
was to work out a table of logarithms
to four places and to construct a slide
rule in both of these operations jan
joined with growing enthusiasm as
understanding increased

  as the preparations progressed


startling stories

connor began to notice other things-
the vanishing of familiar faces the
lack of youthful activities he knew
what that meant the revolutionaries
were gradually filtering into urbs and
the day of the uprising was at hand

  how close it was however he never
dreamed until he emerged one morn-
ing to find evanie talking to jan orm
with her eyes alight she turned
eagerly to tom led him back into the
cottage

 kiss me she whispered the
day is here we leave for urbs to-
night

all day there was a hush over the
village it was bereft of youth
girls as well as men only the oldsters
plodded about in street and field

  jan orm confessed to connor that
he was not entirely pleased with all
details his estimate of the number
of revolutionaries who would join him
had been too high but the infiltration
into the city had been successful and
twenty-two thousand villagers lay
armed and hidden among their urban
sympathizers this jan argued
promised a great accession to their
ranks once the hour had struck

 what are your arrangements
connor asked

  each village has chosen its leader
these leaders have again centralized
their command into ten of whom our
ormon leader happens to be one but
each variety of weed has its own
corps he smiled they call us
weeds because were supposed to run
wild

  and again there came to connor a
quick mental picture of his beautiful
girl of the forest she too had spoken
of weeds a little contemptuously
he seemed to remember now he had
not understood her allusion then had
not asked her to explain but it was
plain enough now her lofty attitude
toward weeds or the common peo-
ple must have been because she was
an aristocrat herself who could she
have been he had seen no one here-
abouts bearing any faintest resem-
blance to her

  he brought his mind swiftly back to
jan

  if you win he observed youll
have a general battle over the spoils
you may find yourself worse off after
the revolution than before

  we know that jan said grimly
yet well fight side by side until the
masters done for afterward- he
spread his hands expressively

 you mentioned our ormon
leader remarked connor thats
you of course

  oh no jan chuckled thats
evanie

  the devil connor stared amazed
at the gentle shy and quiet girl

  jan exaggerates she said smil-
ing i depend on all the rest of you
especially jan-and you tom

  he shook his head puzzled about
this revolution-shadowy vague ill-
planned to assault a world ruler in
a colossal city with untrained rabble
using weapons unfamiliar to them
surely the master must know there
was sedition and plotting among his
people

  he was about to voice his doubts
when a flash of iridescence down the
sunny slope caught his eye it seemed
more like a disturbance in the air or
a focus of light than a material body
it swept in wide circles as if hunting
or seeking and-connor heard its
high humming buzz the creature if
it were a creature was no more than
eighteen inches long and featureless
save for a misty beak at the forward
end

  it circled closer and suddenly he
perceived an amazing phenomenon it
was circling the three of them and he
had thought the cottage too then
he saw that instead of circling the
building it was passing through the
walls

  look he cried whats that

       chapter ix
       the way to urbs

the effect on jan and evanie was
startling as they perceived the
almost invisible thing the girl
shrieked in terror
the black flame



  dont look at it jan choked out
dont even think of it

  both of them covered their faces
with their hands

  they made no attempt to flee  in-
deed connor thought confusedly
how could one hide from a thing that
could pass like a phantom through
rock walls he tried to follow their
examplbut could not resist another
peep at the mystery it was still visi-
ble but further off down the slope

 mands said evanie

you dont say he snapped iron-
ically i could guess that from its
name but what is it

its a mechanism of force or so
we think said jan its- did you
ever see ball-lightning 

connor nodded

well theres nothing material
strictly speaking in ball-lightning
its a balance of electrical forces and
so are the messengers-a structure of

                   the amphimorph shot

toward the river and as he gazed it
abandoned its circling passed like a
streak of mist over the water and
vanished

  its gone he said mildly sup-
pose you tell me what it was

  it-it was a messenger of the
master murmured evanie fearfully
jan do you think it was for one of
us if so that means he suspects
god knows jan muttered it
looked dim to me like a stray

and what connor demanded to
know is a messenger of the master
its to carry the masters com-

               xxiii

forces

  but-was it alive

  we believe not not exactly alive
connor groaned not material
strictly speaking and not exactly
alive in other words a ghost

  jan smiled nervously

  it does sound queer what i mean
is that the messengers are composed
of forces like ball-lightning theyre
stable as long as urbs supplies enough
energy to offset the losses they dont
discharge all at once like ball-light-
ning when their energy is cut off
they just dissipate fade out vanish


startling stories

that one missed its mark if it was for

us

 how do they bear the masters
commands

  i hope you never find out evanie
said softly i was sent for once be-
fore but that messenger missed like
this jan and i-can close our minds
to them it takes practice to learn
how

  well said connor if the master
suspects youd better change your
plans surprise was your one advan-
tage

  we cant jan said grimly our
cooperating groups would split into
factions in half an hour given any
excuse

  but-that might have been sent as
a warning

no matter weve got to go ahead
whats more wed better leave now

jan rose abruptly and departed a
moment later connor saw him
back in a motor vehicle from the hill
below the factory and then with no
more preparation than that they were
jolting over the rutted red clay road
jan driving evanie between the two
men

 when they swung suddenly to a
wide paved highway the battered
vehicle leaped swiftly to unexpected
speed a full hundred miles an hour
though that was not so greatly in ex-
cess of the speed of cars of connors
own day

  hour after hour they rushed down
the endless way they passed tree-
grown ruins and little villages like
ormon and as night fell here and
there the lights of some peaceful farm
dwelling evanie relieved jan and
then connor pleading his acquaint-
ance with ancient automobiles drove
for awhile to the expressed admira-
tion of the other two

 you ancients must have been
amazing said jan

  what paving is this asked con-
nor as they darted along

  same stuff as our tires rubrum
synthetic rubber

 paved by whom

  by urbs said jan sourly out
of our taxes

  well isnt that one answer to your
objections no taxes no roads

  the road through ormon is main-
tained without taxes simply by the
cooperation of the people

  connor smiled remembering that
rutted clay road

  is it possible to alienate any of the
masters troops he asked trained
men would help our chances

  no jan said positively the man
has a genius for loyalty such an at-
tempt would be suicide

 humph do you know-the more
i hear of the master the more i like
him i cant see why you hate him
so apparently hes a good ruler
he is a good ruler damn his clever
soul if he werent i told you every-
bodyd be on our side jan turned to
evanie see how dangerous the
master is his charm strikes even
through the words of his enemies
when they finally stopped for re-
freshments evanie described for con-
nor other wonders of the masters
world empire she told him of the
hot-house cities of antarctica under
their crystal domes and especially
austropolis of the great mining city
in the shadow of the southern pole
and of nyx lying precariously on the
slopes of the volcano erebus

  she had a wealth of detail gleaned
from the vision screen but jan orm
had traveled there and added terse
comment all traffic and freight came
in by rocket the triangles of urbs
a means too expensive for general use
but the mines produced the highly-
prized metal platinum

  evanie spoke too of the urban
pond the new sea formed in the
sahara desert by the blasting of a
passage through the atlas mountains
to the mediterranean that had made
of algeria and tripoli fertile coun-
tries and by the increased surface for
evaporation it had changed even the
climate of the distant arabian desert

and there was eartheye on the
summit of sky-piercing everest
the great observatory whose objective
mirror was a spinning pool of mercury
a hundred feet across and whose
images of stellar bodies were broad-
the black flame



cast to students around the world in
this gigantic mirror betelgeuse
showed a measurable disc the moon
was a pitted plain thirty yards away
and even mars glowed cryptically at
a distance of only two and a half miles

  connor learned that the red planet
still held its mystery the canals had
turned out to be illusion but the sea-
sonal changes still argued life and a
million tiny markings hinted at some
sort of civilization

  but theyve been to the moon
evanie said continuing the discussion
as they got under way again theres
a remnant of life there little crystal-
line flowers that the great ladies of
urbs sometimes wear moon orchids
each one worth a fortune

  id like to give you one some day
murmured connor

  look tom evanie cried sharply
a triangle

  he saw it in the radiance of early
dawn it was in fact a triangle with
three girders rising from its points to
an apex whence the blast struck down
through the open center at once he
realized the logic of the construction
for it could neither tip nor fall while
the blast was fed

  how large he couldnt tell since
it hung at an unknown height it
seemed enormous at least a hundred
feet on a side and then a lateral blast
flared and it moved rapidly ahead of
them into the south

  were they watching us do you
suppose evanie asked tensely but
-of course not i guess im just nerv-
ous look tom theres kaatskill a
suburb of the city

  the town was one of magnificent
dwellings and vast lawns

  kaatskill mused connor the
home of rip van winkle

  evanie did not get the meaning of
that

  if he lives in kaatskill i never
heard of him she said it is a place
where many wealthy sleepers have
settled to enjoy their wealth

  the road widened suddenly then
they topped the crest of a hill con-
nors eyes widened in astonishment at
the scene unfolded

  a valley lay before them and

  cupped in the hills as in the palm of
a colossal hand lay such a hive of
mammoth buildings that for a mo-
ment reason refused to accept it
urbs connor knew instantly that
only the world capital could stretch
in such reaches across to the distant
blue hills beyond

  he stared at sky-piercing struc-
tures at tiered streets at the curious
steel web where a monorail car sped
like a spider along its silken strand

 there urbs minor whispered
evanie lesser urbs

  lesser urbs

  yes urbs major is beyond see
toward the hills

 he saw he saw the incredible
structures that loomed gargantuan
he saw a fleecy cloud drift across one
while behind it twin towers struck yet
higher toward the heavens

  the spires of the palace mur-
mured evanie

 they sped along the topmost of
three tiers and the vast structures
were blotted out by nearer ones for
an hour and a half they passed along
that seemingly endless street the
morning life of urbs was appearing
traffic flowed pedestrians moved in
and out of doorways

the dress of the city had some-
thing military about it with men
and women alike garbed in metallic-
scaled shirts and either kirtles or brief
shorts with sandaled feet they were
slight in build as were the ormon
folk but they had none of the easy-
going complacency of the villagers
they were hectic and hurried and
the sight struck a familiar note across
the centuries

  urbs was city incarnate connor
felt the brilliance the glamour the
wickedness that is a part of all great
cities from babylon to chicago here
were all of them in one all the great
cities that ever were all in this gigan-
tic metropolis babylon reborn-im-
perial rome made young again

  they crossed suddenly a three-
tiered viaduct over brown water

  the canal that makes urbs a sea-
port evanie explained

beyond rising clifflike from the


startling stories

bank soared those structural colossi
connor had seen in the blue distance
towering unbelievably into the bright
sky he felt pygmylike crushed
stifled so enormous was the mass he
did not need evanies whisper
across the water is greater urbs
those mountainous piles could be
nothing less

  on the crowded sidewalks brilliant-
costumed people flowed by many
smoking black cigarettes that roused
a longing in tom connor for his an-
cient pipe now disintegrated a thou-
sand years he stared at the bold ur-
ban women with their short hair and
metallic garb now and again one
stared back either contemptuously
noting his weed clothing or in ad-
miration of his strong figure

  jan orm guided the car down a long
ramp past the second tier and down
into the dusk of the ground level
they cut into a solid line of thunder-
ous trucks and finally pulled up at
the base of one of the giant buildings
jan drew a deep sigh

  were here he said urbs
connor made no reply in his mind
was only the stunning thought that
this colossus called urbs was the city
they were to attempt to conquer with
their weed army-a handful of less
than twenty-five thousand

chapter x
revolution

ith the cessation of the cars
movement a blanket of humid
heat closed down on them the ground
level was sultry hot with the stag-
nant breath of thirty million pairs of
lungs

  then as connor alighted there was
a whir and he glanced up to see a fan
blower dissolve into whirling in-
visibility drawing up the fetid accu-
mulation of air a faint coolness
wafted along the tunnel-like street
for perhaps half a minute the fan
hummed then was stilled the colos-
sal city breathed in thirty-second
gasps

  they moved into the building to a
temperature almost chilly after the
furnace heat outside connor heard
the hiss of a cooling system recog-
nized the sibilance since he had heard
it from a similar system in evanies
cottage they followed jan to an ele-
vator one of a bank of fully forty and
identical to one of the automatic lifts
in an ancient apartment building

  jan pressed a button and the cage
shot into swift and silent motion it
seemed a long time before it clicked
to a halt at the seventy-fourth floor
the doors swung noiselessly aside
and they emerged into a carpeted hall
following jan to a door halfway down
the corridor a faint murmur of voices
within ceased as jan pressed a bell-
push

  in the moment of silence a faint
bluish light outlined the faces of jan
and evanie connor standing a bit to
the side was beyond it

 looking us over on a vision
screen whispered jan and instantly
the door opened connor heard voices

 evanie sair and jan orm at
last

  connor followed them into a small
chamber and was a little taken aback
by the hush that greeted his appear-
ance he faced the group of leaders in
the room half a dozen men and an
equal number of women all garbed in
urban dress and all frozen in im-
mobile surprise

 this is tom connor jan orm
said quickly he suggested the
rifles

  well drawled a golden-haired
girl relaxing he looks like a cool
immortal lord i thought we were
in for it

  youd manage ena said a strik-
ing dark-haired beauty laughing dis-
dainfully

  dont mind maris the blonde
smiled at connor shes been told
she looks like the princess hence the
air of hauteur she paused and
what do you think of urbs

 crowded connor said and
grinned

  crowded you should see it on a
business day

  its their weekly holiday ex-
the black flame



plained evanie sunday we chose
it purposely therell be fewer guards
in the palace seeing room

  for the first time connor realized
that sundays passed unobserved in
the peaceful life of ormon

  jan was surveying the urban cos-
tumes in grim disapproval

  lets get to business he said
shortly

there was a chorus of hush
the girl maris added you know
theres a scanner in every rcom in
urbs jan we can be seen from the
palace and heard too

  she nodded toward one of the light-
brackets on the wall after a moment
of close inspection connor distin-
guished the tiny crystal eye

  why not cover it he asked in a
low voice

  that would bring a palace officer
in five minutes responded the blond
ena a blank on the screen sticks
out like the alpha building

she summoned the group close
about her slipping a casual arm
through connors in an almost in-
audible whisper she began to detail
the progress of the plans replying to
jans queries about the distribution of
weapons and where they now were to
evanies question about the appointed
time to inquiries from each of the
others

  evanies report of the messenger
caused some apprehension

 do you think he knows asked
ena he must unless it was some
stray that passed near you

 suppose he does countered
evanie he cant know when were
ready arent we why not strike to-
day-now-at once

  there was a chorus of whispered
protest

  we oughtnt to risk everything on
a sudden decision-its too reckless
ena presed connors arm and whis-
pered what do you think

  he caught an angry glance from
evanie she resented the blond girls
obvious attention

 evanies right he murmured
the only chance this half-baked
revolution has is surprise lose that

and youve lost everything

  and such after more whispered dis-
cussion was the decision the blow
was to be struck at one oclock just
two hours away the leaders de-
parted to pass the instructions to their
subordinate leaders until only connor
and evanie remained even jan orm
had gone to warn the men of ormon

  evanie seemed about to speak to
connor but suddenly turned her back
on him

  whats the matter evanie he
said softly

  he was unprepared for the violence
with which she swung around her
brown eyes blazing

  matter she snapped you dare
ask with the feel of that canary-
headed enas fingers still warm on
your arm

  but evanie he protested i did
nothing

  you let her

 but-

  you let her

  further protest was prevented by the
return of the patrician maris evanie
dropped into a sulky silence not
broken until shortly jan orm ap-
peared

  it was a solemn group that emerged
on the ground level and turned their
steps in the direction of the twin-tow-
ered palace evanie had apparently
forgotten her grievance in the impor-
tance of the impending moment but
all were silent and thoughtful

  not even connor had eyes for pal-
ace avenue and the tumult and tur-
moil of that great street boiled about
him unnoticed through the girders
above the traffic of the second and
third tiers sent rumbling thunder but
he never glanced up trudging ab-
stractedly beside evanie

a hundred feet from the
streets end they paused
through the tunnel-like opening
where palace avenue divided to cir-
cle the broad grounds of the palace
connor gazed at a vista of green lawn
surmounted by the flight of white
steps that led to the arch where the
enormous diorite statue of holland
the father of knowledge sat peering


startling stories

with narrowed eyes into an ancient

volume

  two minutes said jan with a
nervous glance around wed better
move forward

 they reached the open the
grounds surrounded by the incredible
wall of mountainous buildings glowed
green as a lake in the sun and the full
vastness of the palace burst upon con-
nors eyes towering into the heavens
like a twin-peaked mountain for a
moment he gazed awe-struck then
glanced back into the cave of the
ground level waiting for the hour to
strike

  it came booming out of the palace
tower one oclock instantly the
ground level was a teeming mass of
humanity swarming out of the build-
ings in a torrent sunlight glanced
flashing from rifle barrels shouts
sounded in a wild chorus swiftly the
ormon men gathered around evanie
whose brilliant costume of green and
crimson formed a rallying point like a
flag

  the mob became an army each
group falling into formation about its
leader men ran shouting into the
streets on the broad avenue that cir-
cled the grounds on the second and
third tiers instantly a traffic jam be-
gan to spread to epic proportions
and then between the vehicles the
mass of humanity flowed across the
street toward the palace

  from other streets to right and left
other crowds were pouring the
black-haired maris was striding bare-
limbed and lithe before her forces
white frightened faces stared from a
thousand stalled cars

  then the heterogeneous mob was
sweeping up the slope of grass a surg-
ing mass converging from every side
the palace was surrounded at the
mercy of the mob and then-the
whole frenzied panorama froze sud-
denly into immobility

  from a dozen doors and down the
wide white steps came men-urban
men with glittering metallic cuirasses
and bare brown limbs they moved
deliberately in the manner of trained
troops quickly they formed an inner
circle about the palace an opposing

line to the menacing thousands with-
out

  they were few compared to the
revolutionary forces yet for a tense
moment the charge was halted and
the two lines glared at each other
across a few hundred feet of grassy
slope

that moment was etched forever
in connors mind he seemed to
see everything with the strange clar-
ity that excitement can lend the
glint of sunlight on steel the vast in-
extricable jam of traffic the motion-
less thousands on the hill the untold
thousands peering from every window
in every one of the gigantic buildings
the frowning towers of the palace
and even on a balcony of stone far up
on the left tower two tiny shining
figures surveying the scene the
three triangles hanging motionless as
clouds high in the heavens the vast
brooding figure of holland staring un-
perturbed into his black stone book

  hes warned-hes ready jan
muttered

  well have to fire evanie cried

  but before her command the sharp
rattle of rifles came from far to the
right machine-guns sputtered and
all down the widespread line puffs of
steam billowed like huge white chry-
santhemums and dissipated at once

  from a thousand windows in the
bank of buildings burst other momen-
tary clouds and the medley of shouts
punctuated by staccato explosions
was like a chorus of wild music

  connor stared thunderstruck in
the opposing line not a single man
had fallen each stood motionless as
the giant statue left arm crooked
across breast right arm holding a
glistening revolverlike weapon was
marksmanship responsible for that-
incredibly poor markmanship

  imposible with that hail of bullets
puffs of dust spurted up before the
line splintered stone flew from the
walls behind windows crashed
but not one urban soldier moved

  whats wrong connor yelled

 he knew jan orm panted
hes equipped his men with paige
deflectors hes the devil himself
the black flame



they had formed a new sea in the sahara chapter ix

  the girl maris leaped forward

  come on she shouted and led the
charge

  instantly the line of urbans raised
their weapons laying them across
their bent left arms a faint misty
radiance stabbed out a hundred brief
flashes of light the beams swept the
revolutionaries anguished cries
broke out as men spun and writhed

  connor leaped back as a flash caught
him sudden pain racked him as his
muscles tore against each other in vio-
lent spasmodic contractions a mo-
ment only then he was trembling and
aching as the beam flicked out an
electric shock none should know
that better than he

 everywhere the revolutionaries
were writhing in agony the front
ranks were down and of all those near
him only he and evanie were stand-
ing her face was strained and white
and agonized

  jan orm was struggling to his feet

his face a mask of pain beyond him
others were crawling away connor
was astounded the shock had been
painful but not that painful

  halfway up the slope before the im-
mobile line of urbans lay the black-
haired maris her nerves had been
unequal to the task set them and she
had fainted from sheer pain the
whole mass of the weed army was
wavering the revolution was fail-
ing

chapter xi
flight

connor had an inspiration the
deflecting force must emanate
from the glittering buttons on the
urbans left arms moreover the field
must be projected only before the
urban soldiers else theyd not be able


startling stories

to move their own weapons spring-
ing to a fallen machine-gun he righted
it spun it far to the left so as to en-
filade the urbans to strike them from
the side

  he pulled the trigger-let out a yell
of fierce joy as a dozen foemen top-
pled he tried to shout his discovery
to the others but none heeded and
anyhow the urbans could counter it
by a slight shift of formation so
grimly he cut as wide a gap as he
could

  the beams flashed steeling him-
self to the agony of the shock he
bore it unflinching when it had
passed the weed army was in flight
he muttered a vicious curse and
jerked a groaning man on the ground
beside him to his feet

  youre still alive you sheep he
snarled get up and carry that girl
he gestured at the prostrate maris

  the slope was clearing only half
a hundred weeds lay twisting on the
grass or were staggering painfully
erect connor glared at the slowly
advancing urbans faced them for a
moment disdainfully then turned to
follow the flying weeds halfway
across the grounds he paused seized
an abandoned rifle and dropped to his
knee

  in a gesture of utter defiance he
took careful aim at the two figures on
the tower balcony five hundred feet
above he pressed the trigger ten
shots spat out in quick succession
windows splintered above the figures
below to right and left tom con-
nor swore again as he realized that
these too were protected then he
gritted his teeth as the ionic beam
swept him once more

  when it ceased he fled to mingle
with the last of the retreating weed
forces they were trickling through
over and around that traffic jam that
would take heroic efforts to untangle

  the revolution was over no man
could now reorganize that flying mob
connor thrust his way through the
mass of panic-stricken humanity until
he reached the car in which jan and
evanie were already waiting

  without a word jan swung the car
hastily about for the traffic snarl was

reaching even as far away as he had
parked evanie dropped her head on
connors shoulder weeping quietly

  thats a hell of a revolution he
erunted twenty minutes and its
over

  the car swept through the semi-
dusk of the ground level of palace
avenue to the point where the ramp
curved about the base of the atlas
building there jan guided it into
the sunlight of the upper tier in the
afternoon glare his face was worn and
haggard evanie her spell of weep-
ing over was pallid and expression-
less like a statue in ivory

 wont we be stopped connor
asked as jan put on speed

  theyll try said jan theyll
block all of the hundred bridges i
hope we get across first we can only
hope because they can see every move
we make of course there are scan-
ners on every street we may be
watched from the palace now

 the bridge over which they had
come into the city loomed before them
in a moment they were over the canal
and into urbs minor where ten mil-
lion people still moved about their oc-
cupations in utter ignorance of the
revolution and its outcome

the colossal buildings of greater
urbs receded and took on the blue
hue of distance and lesser urbs
slipped rapidly by them it was not
until they had surmounted the ridge
and dropped into kaatskill that jan
gave any evidence of relaxing there
he drew a deep breath

  respite he murmured goomily
there are no scanners here at least
whats to be done now asked
connor

  heaven knows well be hunted of
course-everybody who was in it but
in montmercis rebellion the master
punished only one-montmerci him-
self the leader

  evanies grandfather

  yes that may weigh against her
this damned revolution was
doomed from the start declared con-
nor irritably we hadnt enough or-
ganization nor good enough weapons
nor an effective plan-nothing and
the black flame



having lost the advantage of sur-
prise we had no chance at all

  dont evanie murmured wearily
we know that now

  i knew it the whole time he re-
torted by the way jan-those
paige deflectors of theirs do you
know how they work

  of course jans voice was as
weary as evanies its just an in-
ductive field and metal passing
through it has eddy currents induced
in it

 simple enough mused connor
hed seen the old experiment of the
aluminum ring tossed by eddy cur-
rents from the pole of an alternating
current magnet but he asked in sur-
prise

  against such velocities

  yes the greater the velocity the
stronger the eddy currents the bul-
lets speed helps to deflect it

  did you know of these deflectors
before snapped connor

  of course but projectile weap-
ons havent been used for so long-
how could i dream hed know of our
rifles and resurrect the deflectors
you should have anticipated the
possibility why we could have
used- he broke off recriminations
were useless now never mind tell
me about the ionic beam jan

  its just two parallel beams of
highly actinic light like gamma rays
they ionize the air they pass through
the ionized air is a conductor
theres an atomic generator in the
handles of the beam-pistols and it
shoots an electric charge along the
beams and when your body closes

the circuit between them-lord
they didnt use a killing potential or
wed have been burned to a crisp i
still ache from that agony

  evanie stood up to it connor re-
marked

  just once murmured the girl a
second time-oh id have died

  it struck connor that this delicate
small-boned nervous race must be
more sensitive less inured to pain
than himself he had stood the shock
with little difficulty

  youre lucky you werent touched
said jan

 connor snorted i was touched
three times-the third time by ten
beams if youd listened to me we
could have won the dog-fight anyway
i blew a dozen urbans down by firing
from the side

  you what

  i saw that said evanie just be-
fore the second beam but i-i
couldnt stand any more

  it makes our position worse i sup-
pose muttered jan the master
will be angry at injury to his men

connor gave it up jans regret
that the enemy had suffered dam-
age simply capped a long overdue
climax he was loathe to blame jan
or the whole weed army for flying
from the searing touch of the ionic
beams he felt himself an unfair
judge since he couldnt feel with their
nerves more than likely what was
merely painful to his more rugged
body was unbearable agony to them

  what did trouble him was the reali-
zation that he failed to understand

startling stories

these people failed to comprehend
their viewpoint this whole mess of
a revolution seemed ill-planned futile
unnecessary even stupid

  this set him to wondering about
evanie was it fair to try to bring
love into her life to rouse her from
the reserve she had cast about herself
might that not threaten unhappiness
to both of them-these two strangers
from different ages

  humanity had changed during his
long sleep the only personality in
this world with whom he felt the
slightest sympathy was-the master

  a man he had never even seen un-
less one of the two shining figures on
the tower had been he like himself
the master was a survival of an earlier
time therein perhaps lay the bond

  his musings were interrupted by a
flash of iridescence in the air ahead
there was a long desolate silence as
the car sped onward

  well jam orm at last said gloom-
ily its come

  but connor already knew instinc-
tively that what he had seen was the
rainbow glint of one of the masters
messengers

  for which of us do you suppose
he asked soberly

  for evanie i guess but dont
watch it-dont think of it it might
be for you

  evanie was lying back in the seat
eyes shut features blank she had
closed her mind to the unholy thing
but connor was unable to keep either
mind or eyes from the circling mys-
tery as it swept silently about the
speeding car

  its closing in he whispered to
jan

  jan reached a sudden decision a
rutted road branched ahead of them
and he swung the car into it boring
toward the hills

  weed village in here he mut-
tered perhaps we can lose it there

  how it can pass through brick
walls

  i know but the pneumatic freight
tube goes through here the tubes
fast as a scared meteor we can try
it and- he paused grimly

  the sun was low in the west when

they came to the village a tiny place
nestled among green hills the omin-
ous circling thing was glowing faintly
in the dusk now no more than twenty
yards away evanie had kept to her
resolute silence never glancing at the
threatening mystery

in the village jan talked to an an-
cient bearded individual and re-
turned to the car with a frown

  he has only two cylinders he an-
nounced you and evanie are go-
ing

  connor clambered out of the car

  see here he whispered youre
in more danger than i leave me with
the car i can find my way to ormon

  jan shook his head listen a mo-
ment he said firmly understand
what im saying i love evanie ive
always loved her but its you thats
been given to waken her you must
go with her and for gods sake-
quickly

  reluctantly connor and evanie fal-
lowed jan into a stone building where
the nervous old man stood above two
seven-foot cylinders lying on a little
track without a word the girl clam-
bered into the first lying flat on her
face with her tiny sandals pressed
against the rear

  the ancient snapped down the cover
like a coffin lid connors heart sank
as the man shoved the metal cylinder
into a round opening closed down a
door behind it and twirled a hissing
handle jan motioned tom connor to
the other tube and at that moment the
flashing iridescence of the messenger
swept through the room and away
he climbed hastily in lying as evanie
had done

  to ormon he asked

 no to the next weed village
back in the mountains hurry

       chapter xii
       the messenger

trie old man slammed the cover
connor lay in utter darkness but
as he felt the cylinder slide along the
the black flame



track he thought he glimpsed for a
bare instant the luminous messenger
in a flash through the metal sides he
heard the faint clang of the door and
there was a brief moment of quiet

  then with a force that bent his
knees he felt the thrust of terrific ac-
celeration only a faint rumble came
to his ears but he realized that his
speed must be enormous then the
pressure shifted he felt his hands
driven against the front and in a few
more seconds no pressure at all

  the cover was raised he thrust
himself out to face evanie just clam-
bering from her own cylinder and a
frightened nondescript man who mut-
tered frantically

  dont tell on me dont tell

  he turned to listen to a low-voiced
inquiry from evanie and answered
in an inaudible whisper and a gesture
to the north

  connor followed evanie as she hur-
ried out of the building into darkness
he caught a faint glimpse of the stone
cottages of a village smaller than or-
mon then they were trudging over a
dim trail toward the hills black
against the stars

  to the metamorphs of the hills
evanie said mechanically theyll
hide us until its safe she added
wearily im so tired

  that was not surprising after such
a day she started to speak youve
been-oh

  he saw it too the luminous needle-
beaked shape that was the messenger
circling them still twenty yards away

  lord he whispered how fast
can that thing travel

  disembodied electric force she
asked wearily as fast as light i
suppose well-it doesnt matter i
can fight it off if i must but hurry
god connor groaned that per-
sistent demon

  his voice rose in a yell of surprise
and fear the misty thing had stopped
in mid-air poised a moment then
launched itself at his head

  there was no pain just a brief buzz-
ing connor realized that the needle-
beak had thrust itself into his skull
and the horror rested above his shoul-
der he beat at it his hands passed

through it like mist and then in a
squeaky little voice that clicked mad-
deningly within his very brain came
the words of the messenger

  go back to urbs it clicked go
back to urbs over and over go
back to urbs just that

  he turned frantic eyes on evanies
startled face

get it off he cried get it off
it was for you she whispered
stricken oh if it had only been for
me i can fight it close your mind
to it tom try please try

  he did try over and over but that
maddening clicking voice burned
through his efforts go back to urbs
go back to urbs

  i cant stand it connor cried
frantically it tickles-inside my
brain he paced back and forth in
anguish i want to run to walk
until im exhausted i cant-stand-
it

  yes evanie said walk until
youre exhausted it will give us time
that way but walk north-away from
urbs come

he turned wearily to join him
stay here he said ill walk
alone not far ill soon return

  he rushed off into the darkness his
thoughts were turmoil as he dashed
down the dim trail ill fight it off-
go back to urbs-i wont listen-go
back to urbs-if evanie can so can
i im a man stronger than she-go
back to urbs go back to urbs

  clicking - tickling - maddening
he rushed blindly on tripping over
branches crashing into trees he
scrambled up the slope of a steep hill
driving himself trying to exhaust
himself until he could attain the for-
getfulness of sleep

 panting scratched weary he
paused from sheer necessity on the
crest of the hill the horror on his
shoulder clicking its message in his
brain gave him no surcease he was
going mad better death at the
masters hands than this better any-
thing than this he turned about and
plunged toward the hill from which
he had come with his first step south
the maddening voice ceased


startling stories

  he walked on in a relieved daze
not even the dim mist of the mes-
senger on his shoulder detracted from
the sheer ecstasy of stillness he mur-
mured meaningless words of grati-
tude felt an impulse to shout a song

  evanie resting on a fallen log
glanced up at him as he approached

  im going back to urbs he cried
wildly i cant stand this

  you cant i wont let you please
-i can rid you of it given time give
me a little time tom fight it

i wont fight it im going back
he turned frantically to rush on
south in any direction that would
silence that clicking tickling voice of
torment

  go back to urbs it ticked go
back to urbs

  evanie seized his arm

  please-please tom

  he tugged away and spun around
what he immediately saw in the dark-
ness halted him in a luminous arc
not three yards distant spun a second
messenger-and in a mad moment of
perversity he was almost glad

  heres one for you he said grim-
ly now fight it

  the girls face turned pale and ter-
ror stricken ohno no she mur-
mured im so tired-so tired she
turned frightened brown eyes on him
then stay tom dont distract me
now i need-all my strength

  it was too late the second horror
had poised itself and struck glowing
mistily against evanies soft bronze
hair

  she stood frozen only a low moan
of anguish twisting her lips

  connor felt a surge of sympathy
that not even the insanity-breeding
messenger could overcome

  evanie he cried huskily oh my
god what is it saying

  her eyes were wide and terrified

  it says sleep-sleep it says the
world grows dark-your eyes are
closing  she clenched her fists in
frenzy it isnt fair i could fight it
off-i could fight both of them off
given time the master-the master
wants me-unable-to help you

  her eyes grew misty

  suddenly she collapsed at his feet

for a long minute connor stared
down at her then he bent over
gathered her in his arms and moved
out into the darkness toward urbs

  evanie was a light burden but that
first mile down the mountain was a
torment that was burned into connors
jnemory forever the messenger was
still as he began the return and he
managed well enough by the starlight
to follow the trail but a thousand
feet of mountain unevenness and in-
equalities of footing just about ex-
hausted him

  his breath shortened to painful
gasps and his whole body worn out
after two nights of sleeplessness pro-
tested with aches and twinges at last
still cradling evanie in his arms he
sank exhausted on the moss-covered
bole of a fallen tree that glowed with
misty fox-fire

  instantly the messenger took up its
distractingly irritating admonition

  go back to urbs it clicked deep
in his brain go back to urbs go
back to urbs

  he bore the torment for five min-
utes before he rose in wild obedience
and staggered south with his burden

  but another quarter mile found him
reeling and dizzy with exhaustion
lurching into trees and bushes
scratched torn and ragged once
evanies hair caught in the thorns of
some shadowy shrub and when he
paused to disentangle it the mes-
senger took up its maddening refrain
he tore the girl loose with a desper-
ately convulsive gesture and blun-
dered on along the trail

  he was on the verge of collapse
after a single mile and urbs lay-god
only knew how far south he shifted
evanie from his arms to his shoulder
but the thought of abandoning her
never entered his mind

  but the time came when his wearied
body could go no further letting
evanies limp body slide to the ground
he closed his eyes in agony as the tor-
turing voice of the messenger re-
sumed as he dropped beside her

  i cant he croaked as though the
messenger or its distant controller
could hear him do you want to kill
me
the black flame



  the sublimity of relief the voice
was still and he relaxed in an ecstasy
of rest he realized to the full the
sweetness of simple silence the ab-
solute perfection of merely being
quiet

  he sighed drawing in great breaths
to fill his straining lungs

  he slumped full length to the
ground then and in a moment was
sleeping as profoundly as evanie her-
self

  when tom connor awoke to broad
day a heap of fruit and a shallow
wooden bowl of water were beside
him connor guessed that they had been
placed there by the metamorphs that
roamed the hills

  they were still loyal to evanie
watching out for her

  he ate hungrily then lifted eva-
nies bronze head tilting the water
against her lips she choked swal-
lowed a mouthful or two but moved
no more than that

  the damage to his clothing from his
plunge through the darkness was
slight

  his shirt was torn at sleeves and
shoulder and his trousers were ripped
in several places evanies soft hair
was tangled with twigs and burrs and
a thorn had scratched her cheek the
elastic that bound her trouser leg to
her left ankle was broken and the
garment flapped loosely the bared
ankle was crossed by a reddened gash

  he poured what remained of the
water over the wound to wash away
any dirt or foreign substance that
might be in it that was all his surg-
ery encompassed

chapter xiii
the trail back

by daylight the messenger was
only a blur visible out of the
corner of his eye like a tear in the eye
itself the demon on evanies shoul-
der was a shifting iridescence no more
solid than the heat-waves above a sum-
mer road he stared compassionately
down on the still white face of the
girl and it was at that moment that
the messenger took up its inexorable
clicking chant go back to urbs go
back to urbs

  he sighed lifted the girl in arms
still aching and took up his laborious
journey yard by yard he trudged
along the uneven trail when the
blood began to pound in his ears he
rested again and the silent messenger
on his shoulder remained silent only
when his strength had returned did
its voice take up the admonition

  connor hated the master now hated
him for these past hours of torture
and for the pallor of evanies cheeks
and her body limp in his arms

  the sun rose higher struck down
burning rays on his body the per-
spiration that dampened his clothes
was warm and sticky while he toiled
along and clammily cold while he
rested shiny beads of it were on the
brow of the unconscious girl while his
own face was covered with trickling
rivulets that stung his eyes and bore
salty drops to his lips and the air

was hot-hot

  staggering south resting plowing
on again it was near sunset when he
approached the weed village where
they had emerged from the pneumatic
tube a man digging before a cottage
stared at him and fled through the
door on the steps of the building
that housed the tube half a dozen
idlers moved hastily within and he
glimpsed the panic-stricken nonde-
script who had released him from the
freight cylinder

  connor strode wearily to the steps
and deposited evanie he glared at
the pale faces beyond the door

  i want food he snapped and
wine do you hear wine

  someone slipped timidly past him
in a moment he was back with coarse
brown bread and cold meat and a bot-
tle of the tart wild grape wine of the
region connor ate silently realizing
that eyes peered at him from every
window when he had finished he
poured wine between evanies lips it
was the only nourishment he could
give her

  you in there he called can any
of you release us from these things

 evidently that was a mistake
there was a terrified rustling within
and a hurried exodus from some other
door the messenger took up its re-
frain with maddening promptness
abandoning hope of aid once again
he picked up evanie and tramped into
the darkness

  the demon on his shoulder finally
let him sleep it was just dawn when
he awoke and scarcely had he opened
his eyes on this second morning of his
tortuous trek when the clicking voice
resumed its chant he made no at-
tempt to resist it but rose and strug-
gled on with his burden now he fol-
lowed  clay road on which he could
avoid tearing thorns and branches

  no more than a mile from the vil-
lage he topped a rise to view a wide
black highway perhaps the same over
which he and jan orm and evanie
had sped to urbs-just two days ago
he found the rubbery surface some-
what less tiring and managed a little
more distance between rests but the
journey was painfully slow yet the

messenger never hurried him he was
permitted ample rest

wtow and again vehicles hummed
- past mostly giant trucks oc-
casionally a speedirtg machine slowed
as if to stop but one glimpse of the
mistiness on his shoulder sent the
driver whizzing on no one apparent-
ly dared association with the bearer
of that dread badge of the masters
enmity it was with amazement there-
fore that conjior saw a truck actually
stopping and heard a cheerful invita-
tion to come on in

  he clambered laboriously into the
cab placing evanie on the seat be-
side him holding her against him he
thanked the driver a pleaant-fea-
tured youth apd relaxed silent

 weed trouble eh the driver
asked he stared at connors shoulder

  say you must be a pretty import-
ant weed to rate a messenger he
glanced sideward at connor and sud-
denly grinned i know you now
youre the fellow that carried the
beam when hell popped sunday lord
stood right up to the beam in his
tone was deep admiration

  connor said nothing

  well youre in for it all right the
youth resumed cheerfully you blew
down some of the masters men and
thats bad

  what did he do with the others
connor asked gloomily they
couldnt all get away

  he only picked up the leaders
nine of em vision didnt say what
he did papers say he released some
of em girl who thinks she looks like
the princess

  maris thought connor and eva-
nie was the tenth of the decemvirate
he himself was tossed in for good
measure well perhaps he might bar-
gain for evanies release after all
he had something to trade

  it was mid-afternoon before they
looked down on kaatskill and connor
realized in astonishment the distance
over which they must have flashed in
the freight tube then he forgot all
else as urbs minor appeared with its
thousands of towers and far across
the valley the misty peaks that were
the black flame



the colossus greater urbs

  the truck kept to the ground level
the mighty buildings shielded by the
upper streets from sight were less
spectacular here but their vast bases
seemed to press upon the ground like
a range of mountains until connor
wondered why the solid earth did not
sink beneath their weight millions
upon millions of tons of metal and
masonry-and all of it as if it rested
on his own brain so despondent did
he feel

  presently they were on palace ave-
nue even the ground level of that
mighty street was crowded connor
already knew its almost lengendary
reputation what the via appia was
to rome or broadway to america of
yore palace avenue now was to the
world main street of the planet
highway of the six-no the seven-
continents for antarctica was an in-
habited continent now

  when the unbelievably magnificent
twin towers came into clean view
the truck came to a halt connor
climbed out and turned to pick up
evanie

  thanks he said you made the
road to hell a lot easier

  the youth grinned

   s nothing good chances weed
youll need em

  connor turned for the long ascent
to the palace he trudged up the in-
terminable flight of steps passing
crowds of urbans who stared and gave
him wide passageway he moved
close under the great brooding dior-
ite statue of holland into the north
doorway of the palace where a guard
stepped hastily aside to admit him

through a door to his right
came the clatter and rustle of
voices and machines engaged in the
business of administering a world
government to his left was a closed
door and ahead the hall debouched
into a room so colossal that at first it
seemed an illusion

  he strode in along the far wall
a thousand feet away was a row of
seats-thrones rather-each on a dais
or platform perhaps ten feet above the
floor and each apparently occupied

perhaps fifty of them before the cen-
tral one stood a group of people and
a few guards flanked it then as he
approached he realized that all but
the central throne were occupied only
by images by cleverly worked statues
of bronze no-two central thrones
held living forms

  he pushed his way roughly through
the knot of people carefully deposited
evanie on the steps ascending to the
seat and glared defiantly at the
master

  for a moment so intent was his
gaze at the man he had come bitterly
to hate through all the torture of his
forced trip that he did not shift his
eyes to the figure who sat beside the
master the princess of whom he had
heard he supposed-the beautiful
cruel margaret of urbs who with her
brother ruled with an iron hand

  but he was not interested in her
now her immortal brother claimed
all his attention all his defiance just
for a breath though connors eyes did
flicker in her direction-and instantly
he stood stockstill frozen wondering
if at last he had lost his mind for
here before his staring eyes was the
most incredible thing he had come
upon in all this incredible new world
and what held him spell-bound was
not so much the utter unbelievable
fantastic beauty of the woman-or
girl-who sat upon the throne of urbs
as was the fact that he knew her gaz-
ing at her frozen in utter surprise and
fascination tom connor knew in that
moment that the cruel margaret of
urbs and the inky-haired white-robed
girl with whom he had spent those
unforgetable moments in the wild-
wood outside the village of ormon
were one and the same

  there could be no possible doubt of
that though in her emerald green eyes
now was no friendly light as she
looked down at him haughtily in that
same manner she might show her dis-
taste for some crawling thing that had
annoyed her but not even her
changed expression not even her rich
garb that had replaced her white robe
of sylvan simplicity could alter the
fact that here before tom connor was
his woman of the woods his girl of


startling stories

mystery the girl who had unfolded to
him the history of this more and more
astonishing age into which fate had
drawn him

  not by the slightest flicker of a long
black curling eyelash did she show
that she had even seen connor before
but even in his own quick resentment
that swiftly followed his frozen mo-
ment of surprise the man from an-
other age uncomfortably realized that
her fascination for him the sway of
her bewildering beauty was as great
as it had been the first moment he had
gazed upon her

 his own predicament-evanie-
everything-was forgotten as if he
were hypnotized

  instead of a gauzy white robe that
was in itself revealing but with a
touch of poetry and mysticism she
now wore the typical revealing cos-
tume of urbs-rose bodice and short
kirtle of golden scales and that hair
of hers-never would connor forget
it-so black that it glinted blue in the
light nor would he even forget her
skin so transparently clear with its
tint like the patina over ancient silver-
bronze

  looking at her now connor could
see how maris might claim a resem-
blance but it was no more than the
resemblance of a candle to the sun
evanie was beautiful too but her
loveliness was that of a human being
while the beauty of this girl who sat
upon a throne was unearthly unbe-
lievable immortal

he sat with her slim legs thrust
carelessly before her her elbow
on the arm of her chair her chin in her
cupped hand and gazed indifferently
from strange sea-green eyes into the
vastness of the giant chamber never
once did she glance at connor after
her first swift distasteful survey

  her exquisite features were expres-
sionless or expressive only of com-
plete boredom though there did
seem to connor that there was the
faintest trace of that unforgettable
mockery in the set of her perfect lips
before he could tear his gaze away
from her she moved slightly with
the movement something flamed on

her breast-a great flower of seven
petals that flashed and glistened in a
dozen colors as if made of jewels

  it took all of connors will power
to keep his eyes from her even though
in that moment of long silence that
had fallen in the throne room with his
entry he was resenting her loathing
her for what she was-instead of what
he had thought her to be

  deliberately he faced the master
head up defiant let the master-let
his princess sister-do what they
pleased he was ready for them

chapter xiv
the master

the man at whom connor stared
the man whose features he had
seen before on evanies coin seemed
no older than the middle twenties he
was dark-eyed and his black hair fell
in a smooth helmet below his ears

  the eyes were strange piercing
shrewd as if they alone had aged as
if they were the receptacles of these
centuries of experience the mouth
was set in a thin cold line and yet
strangely enough there was a faintly
humorous quirk to its corners or not
so strangely either decided connor
a man must have a sense of humor to
survive seven centuries

  and then a deep resonant voice
sounded as the master spoke

  i see thomas connor he said
ironically that you received my mes-
senger hospitably and this is little
evanie his voice changed good
blood he mused the mingling of
the blood of martin sair with that of
montmerci

  connor glared belligerently re-
lease us from these vicious mes-
sengers of yours will you he de-
manded angrily were here

 the master nodded mildly and
spoke briefly into a mouthpiece on a
black table beside him there was a
moments pause then a tingling shock
as the unbound energies of the mes-
senger grounded through connors
body evanie quivered and moaned
the black flame



as the thing on her shoulder vanished
but she lay as quiet as ever

 connor shook himself free he
flashed an angry frown at the impas-
sive master but his eyes kept stray-
ing back to the princess who still not
even glanced at him after that one first
instant

  well said the master quietly
your revolution was a trifle abortive
wasnt it

  up to now snapped connor

  his hatred suddenly overwhelmed
him the impulse for revenge shook
him bodily swiftly stooping he
snatched evanies revolver from her
belt and held the trigger while twelve
shots spat full at the masters face in
a continuous steaming roar

  the steam moved lazily away the
master sat without change of expres-
sion uninjured while from far above
a few splinters of glass from a shat-
tered skylight tinkled about him of
course connor reflected bitterly the
man would be protected by an induc-
tive field glass had been able to pass
through that inductive field where
connors bullets could not but their
glass was a dielectric

  he cast the empty gun aside and
stared sullenly at the man on the
throne then despite his efforts his
gaze was again drawn to the princess

  she was no longer looking abstrac-
tedly into vacancy at the crash of
the shots she had shifted slightly
without raising her chin from her
hand and was watching him their
glances crossed it was like the tingle
of the messengers discharge to him as
he met the cool green eyes inscrutable
and expressionless and utterly disin-
terested and in them was no slight-
est hint of recognition for reasons
of her own she did not mean to recog-
nize him well two could play at that
game

  your impulses take violent form
said the master coldly why do you
who claim to be a newcomer to this
age hate me so

  hate you connor echoed fierce-
ly why shouldnt i didnt you put
me through two days and nights of
hell with your damned messenger

  but there would have been no tor-

ment had you obeyed immediately
but evanie connor snapped
see what youve done to her

  she was interfering i didnt want
her here particularly but she might
have released you from the messenger
if youd left her to herself i would
have freed her within a few hours
kind arent you sneered con-
nor youre so confident in your own
powers that you dont even punish re-
volt well youre a tyrant neverthe-
less and some day youll get more
than you bargain for i could have
done it myself

  he glanced again at the princess
was there the faintest flicker of in-
terest in her imperious eyes

nd what would you have
done queried the master
amiably if you had been running the
revolution

  plenty retorted connor in the
first place id never have shipped
weapons into urbs through the public
tubes you were bound to discover
that and surprise was our greatest
ally id have had em made right here
or near here there must be weed
factories around and if not id have
bought one

  go on said the master interest-
edly what else

  id have had a real organization-
not this cumbersome leader upon
leader pyramid id have laid real
plans planted spies in the palace
and finally your deflectors i didnt
know of them or we could have won
even as things were my-associates
-forgot rather carelessly to mention
them

  the master smiled that was an
error if you had known of them
what would you have done

  id have used wooden bullets in-
stead of metal ones said connor
boldly your induction field wont
stop wood and your ionic beams-
why the devil couldnt we have used
metal screen armor we could have
closed the circuit with that instead of
with our bodies

  he was aware though he steadfastly
refused to look at her that the prin-
cess was watching him now with un-
u

startling stories

disguised mockery her lovely lips
parted in the ghost of a smile

  true said the master with a curi-
ous expression you could have
he frowned i did not believe the
stories i first heard of you-that you
were a sleeper who had awakened
after a sleep of a thousand years they
were too fantastic for belief i
thought you were meaning to capital-
ize on the sleep in some way known
only to yourself-since i understand
you had no bank deposit to draw in-
terest for you and make you a wealthy
man now i am inclined to believe
you have come from another age-an
age of wisdom-and youre a danger-
ous man thomas connor youre a
brave man to bait me as you do and a
strong one but dangerous too dan-
gerous yet im rather sorry your
courage and strength has been bred
out of the race

  what are you going to do

  im going to kill you said the
master softly im sorry were it
not for evanie i might be tempted to
ask for your oath of allegiance and re-
lease you but i cant trust a man who
loves a weed woman its a chance
i dare not take though i bitterly re-
gret losing your blood and your an-
cient knowledge if it consoles you
know that i intend to free evanie
shes harmless to me any trouble she
might cause can be easily handled
but you-youre different

  thanks retorted connor

  like a compass needle his eyes did
return to the face of the princess
then even now condemned to die
for the second time in his strange life
he gazed fascinated at her smiling at
her with an echo of her own mockery

  i dont suppose said the master
hopefully that youd consent to-
say marry evanie and perpetuate
your blood before you die i need that
ancient strain of yours our race has
grown weak

  i would not connor said

  tell me said the other in sudden
eagerness is it true as an ormon
prisoner told us and which i scorned
to believe having then no faith in this
thousand-year sleep that you under-
stand the ancient mathematics cal-

culus logarithms and such lost
branches

  its quite true snapped connor
who told you

 your ormon chemist would you
consent to impart that knowledge
the world needs it

  for my life perhaps

  the master hesitated frowning
im sorry he said at last in-
valuable as the knowledge is the dan-
ger you personally present out-
weighs it i could trick you out of
your secrets i could promise you
life get your information then
quietly kill you i do not stoop to
that if you desire your knowledge
goes to the grave with you

  thanks again retorted connor
you might remember that i could
have concealed my dangerous charac-
ter too i neednt have pointed out
the weakness in your defenses

  i already knew them i also know
the weaknesses of weed mentality
he paused im truly sorry but-this
seems to be the end of our interview
he turned as if to gesture to the
guards along the wall

argaret of urbs flashed a
strange inscrutable glance at
connor and leaned toward the mas-
ter she spoke in low inaudible tones
but emphatically insistently the
master looked up at connor

  i reconsider he said coolly i
grant you your life for the present on
one condition-that you make no move
against me while you are in the pal-
ace i do not ask your word not to
escape i only warn you that a mes-
senger will follow do you agree
connor thought only a moment

  i do

  then you will remain within the
palace the master snapped an or-
der to a guard i will send doctors
to attend little evanie thats all
the guard as tall a man as connor
himself stepped forward and gathered
evanie in his arms connor followed
him but could not resist a backward
glance at the princess who sat once
more staring idly into space but in
his mind was the thought now exult-
ant in spite of his resentment that at
the black flame



least she had not forgotten him or
those hours together in the woods

  they moved into the hall and into
an elevator that flashed upward with
sudden and sickening acceleration
he had glimpses of floor after floor
through the glass doors as they
mounted high into the north tower

 the motion ceased connor fol-
lowed the guard into a room lit by the
red glow of sunset and watched as
he deposited evanie on a white-cov-
ered bedthen turned and threw open
a door that is yours the guard said
briefly and departed

  luxury breathed through the per-
fumed air of the rooms but connor
had no time for such observations he
bent anxiously over the pallid-faced
evanie wondering miserably why the
release of the messenger had not
awakened her he was still gazing
when a knock sounded and two doc-
tors entered

  one the younger set instantly to
work examining the scratch on the
girls ankle while the other pried open
her eyes parted her still lips bent
close to listen to her breathing

 brain-burnt he announced
brain-burnt by a vitergon-the mes-
senger severe electrolepsis

  lord connor muttered anxiously
is it-is it very serious

 serious bah the older man
spun on him its exactly what hap-
pens to sleepers-paralysis of the pre-
rolandic areas the will the conscious-

a cold 

ness like-if im properly informed
-what happened to you it might be
serious if we let her sleep for half a
century not otherwise he stepped
to an ebony table beside the bed de-
canting a ruby liquid into a tumbler
here he said well try a good
stiff stimulant

  he poured the ruddy fluid between
evanies lips and when the last drop
had vanished stood over her watch-
ing she moved convulsively and
moaned in agony

  hah said the doctor thatll
burn some life into her the girl
shuddered and opened dazed and pain-
racked eyes so you can handle
her now he called to the younger
man and moved out of the door

  evanie croaked connor tensely
are you all right how do you
feel

  the dazed eyes rested on him

 i burn water-oh please-
water

tom connor glanced a silent
question at the doctor at his nod
connor seized the empty tumbler and
looked frantically for water he found
it beyond a door where a silent stream

face into a broad basin

  evanie drank eagerly thirstily
when he brought it to her she stared
bewilderedly about the luxurious
room and turned questioning eyes on
connor

  where- she began

  in urbs in the palace
  comprehension dawned

 the messengers oh my god
she shivered in fright how long-
have i-

  just two days evanie i carried
you here

  what is to-to be done with us
i dont know dear but youre
safe

  she frowned a moment in the effort
to compose her still dazed and bewil-
dered mind

 well she murmured finally
nothing can be done about it im
ashamed to have been so weak was
he-very angry

  he didnt seem so the memory
of the masters impassive face rose in
his mind and with it the vision of the
exquisite features of the princess

  i suppose the girl who sits on his
right is the princess isnt she he
asked who is she

  evanie nodded every one knows
that on his left sits martin sair the
giver of life and on his right-why
do you ask that she glanced up
troubled suspicious

  because she saved my life she in-
tervened for me

  tom evanies voice was horror-
filled tom that was margaret of
urbs the black flame her eyes
were terrified tom shes danger-
ous - poisonous - deadly you
mustnt even look at her shes driven
men-i dont know how many-to sui-
cide shes killed men-shes tortured
them dont ever go near her tom
if she saved you it wasnt out of
mercy because shes merciless-ruth-
less-utterly pitiless

  scarcely conscious as yet the girl
was on the verge of hysteria her
voice grew shrill and connor glanced
apprehensively at the young doctors
face

  evanie turned ashen pale

  i-feel-dizzy she choked im

going-to-

  the doctor sprang forward you
mustnt he snapped we cant let
her sleep again we must walk her
quickly

  between them they dragged the col-
lapsing girl from the bed walking her
up and down the chamber a measure
of strength returned and she walked
weakly between them back and forth
then abruptly they paused at the
sound of a sharp rap on the chamber
door

  the doctor called out a summons
two urban guards in glittering metal
strode through the entrance and stood
like images on either side of it one
of them intoned slowly deep as an
anthem

  margarita urbis regina sororque
domini

  the princess connor and the doc-
tor stood frozen and even evanie
raised weary eyes as the princess en-
tered striding imperiously into the
room with the scaly gold of her kirtle
glittering crimson in the last rays of
the sun she swept her cold eyes over
the startled group and suddenly her
exquisite features flashed into a flame
of anger the glorious lips parted

  you fool she spat you utter
fool

connor flushed in sudden anger
then realized that the princess
addressed not him but the doctor at
evanies left who was fear-stricken
and pallid

  you fool repeated margaret of
urbs walking an electroleptic
put her to bed-instantly let her
sleep do you want to risk brain
fever

  the frightened physician moved to
obey but connor interposed

  wait a moment he shot an ac-
cusing glance at the princess do
you know anything about this are
you a doctor

  he received a cool glance from her
narrowed green eyes

  do you think she drawled that
ive learned nothing in seven hundred
years and he alone caught the full
implication of her words she was
subtly reminding him of how once be-
the black flame



fore she had given him evidence of
how vast was her knowledge she
turned imperiously obey she
snapped

  connor stood aside as the doctor
complied in panic

  wheres kringar the princess
demanded

  your highness babbled the med-
ico he gave the girl a stimulant and
left he said-

  all right get out she nodded
at the impassive guards you too
the door closed behind them mar-
garet of urbs bent over evanie now
fully conscious but pale as death she
placed a dainty hand on the girls fore-
head

  sleep she said softly

  leave me here alone please ev-
anie begged trembling im afraid
of you i dont trust you and i wont
sleep im afraid to sleep again
connor stood miserably irresolute
while he hesitated the princess fixed
her eyes on evanies they glowed
emerald in the evening dusk as she
repeated sleep

  he saw the fear vanish from ev-
anies face leaving her features as
blank as those of an image then she
was sleeping

 the princess faced tom connor
across the bed she took a black cig-
arette from a box on the ebony table
it glowed magically as she removed
it and she blew a plume of perfumed
smoke at him

  worried arent you she asked
mockingly

  you know i am

  well rest your mind i mean no
harm to evanie

  but do you know what youre do-
ing

  she laughed low laughter soft as
rain in a pool
see here she said still with a
taunt in her eyes i conceived the
vitergons martin sair created them
but i conceived them i know what
harm they can do and i know the cure
for that harm do you trust me
not entirely

  well you have small choice she
exhaled another cloud of scented
smoke your little weed is safe

she moved toward the adjoining room
theres a bath in here she said
use it and then put on some urban
clothes im inclined to dine with you
this evening

  he was startled he stared back at
the mocking perfection of her face
but the green eyes carried no readable
expression as she came closer so that
only connor could hear what she said

  why he asked

  perhaps to recall a more pleasant
meeting she said gently oh i
have not forgotten you-if that is
what you are thinking i recall every
word of that day in the woods but it
may be better if you forget it pub-
licly margaret of urbs does not care
to have her private business broadcast
to the city nor is it the affair of
anyone here-or any business of yours
-that i choose to get away from them
all occasionally with only the birds
and the trees to bear me company
you will do well to bear that in mind
thomas connor

suddenly her voice took on a
taunting note and the mockery in
the emerald eyes was plain per-
haps she said i have another reason
for commanding you to dine with me
i may want to steal your knowledge-
then kill you i might have more than
one reason for wanting to do that but
you fired a dozen shots at me on sun-
day thomas connor as i stood on the
balcony of the tower i do not fail to
repay such debts

  it will take more than you to steal
what i will not give he growled and
turned into his room closing the door

  he stepped instantly to the hall
door opened it and gazed squarely
into the impassive eyes of an urban
guard standing quietly opposite so
he was watched

  he turned back into the chamber
stripped and entered the water of the
pool reveling in the refreshing cool-
ness as he bathed he could lodk out
a window and saw that the colossal
palace was built as a hollow square
opposite him rose the mountainous
spire of the south tower and far be-
low was the wide pool and green-bor-
dered walks of the inner gardens


startling stories

 drying his glowing body he
glanced distastefully at the sweat-
stained pile of weed clothing on the
floor in a closet he found urban
dress it gave him a queer masquer-
adelike feeling to don the barbaric
metal corselet and kirtle but the gar-
ments were cool and befitted his
great frame

  ready at last he flung open the door
to evanies room

  margaret of urbs sat cross-legged
on the bed beside evanie smoking her
black cigarette her green eyes passed
appraisingly over connor and the
glint of mockery was again in their
depths

  i always thought the ancient sculp-
tors exaggerated their contempora-
ries physiques she said smiling i
was wrong    but youre to kneel
when you enter my presence thomas
connor you didnt before

  and i dont now as an enemy i
owe you no such respect

  as a gentleman you do however
but never mind-im hungry come
why cant we eat here i wont
leave evanie

  evanie will be dull company for a
dozen hours more ill send a maid to
undress and bathe her

  youre very considerate arent
you

  she laughed maliciously

  i have no quarrel with her but i
have with you come

  the glorious green eyes swept him
both eyes and voice-a voice that now
seemed to glory in malice-were so
different from those of the girl of the
woods that it was hard for tom con-
nor to believe they were the same
but he knew they were and now that
he and she were alone every gesture
seemed to admit that

  she rose without a glance at evanies
still white face and connor followed
her reluctantly past the guard whose
challenge she silenced with a peremp-
tory word and over to the bank of
elevators

  where to he asked as the cage
dropped plummetlike

  to a room of mine in the south
tower i think well have to go all
the way down and walk across

the cage came to sickening halt
he followed her through the vast
emptiness of the room of thrones not-
ing curiously that both her own throne
and that of the master were now occu-
pied by cleverly executed bronze fig-
ures he paused to examine the effigy
of the princess wondering how long
ago it had been cast

  third century she said as if in
answer to his thought five hundred
years ago i was a child of two hun-
dred and twenty then-and happier
sardonic amusement was in her face
and manner there was no black
flame in those days i was the mad-
cap princess peggy then reckless and
daring but sweet and noble or so
they thought

  im sure you deserved the reputa-
tion connor observed acidly he
meant to follow her lead in whatever
she said or did she would have no
complaint that he was the first to men-
tion their previous meeting if she
said no more about it then it would
not be mentioned at all

  she flashed her green eyes on him
eyes as icy as the green cap over ant-
arctica

  im sure i deserve it no longer
she said in tones so cold that they
startled come on

  there was something fascinating
almost hypnotic about this weirdly
beautiful being

  id rather dine with your image
there he remarked drily

chapter xvi
immortality

margaret of urbs laughed

and led connor through a door
behind the line of thrones

  martin sairs laboratory she ex-
plained gesturing at the chaotic con-
fusion of glassware and microscopes
and this-passing into a chamber
beyond-is mine

  the place seemed more like a luxur-
ious sumptuously furnished library
than a laboratory there were shelves
upon shelves of books hundreds of
the black flame



them obviously ancient a great vision
screen a delicately inlaid desk and
here and there bits of statuary

 laboratory he echoed what
do you do here

 i think when i want to work i
use martins she picked up a white
carving from the desk see here-
some of your ancient work she
added a trifle sadly we have no art-
ists able to create such beauty today
its a tragedy that the arms were
broken during the dark centuries
i suppose

  connor looked at the exquisite lit-
tle ivory replica of the venus de milo
and laughed

arms broken he scoffed thats
a copy of an ancient greek statue of
praxiteles the arms were broken
two thousand years before my time
a copy wheres the original i

eyes you amuse me weed she
said curtly but very well she led
the way to the south tower elevators

  she was silent during the long ride
to the very pinnacle of the towerthey
emerged into a small chamber walled
on every side in glass and connor
stood awe-struck as the city spread
out before them the palace over-
topped even the colossal structures
around the park he gazed speech-
less at the mighty stretch of peaks
outlined in light

  the princess turned to a black-
screened box

  send dinner to the tower she or-
dered i want-oh anything and
send sora to the room of evanie sair

  she flung herself carelessly on a
purple couch along a glassed wall and
connor sealed himself

  now she said what will you

plus many other unusual stories and features

want it

  it was in the louvre in paris
paris is in ruins do you know
where the louvre stood

  yes

  then tell me ill have it searched
for tell me

  he gazed into eyes sincerely eager
the eyes now of the white-clad girl of
the woods who had lolled with him
on a mossy woodland bank and told
him stories of the ages that girl
had loved beauty too had been seek-
ing it matching her own reflection in
the black pool it amazed him that
now in her role as the frigid princess
she could still be so avid for beauty

  thats a bit of information i with-
hold he said slowly until i can
trade it for something else i may want
evanies safety or my own

  the mocking light returned to her

take for your knowledge

  i wont bargain with you i dont
trust you

  she laughed

  you see me through evanies eyes
tom connor and once-well once i
thought you were attracted to me
but no matter we will not again
speak of that time-though it does
seem odd that fate should have had
me set my triangle down where you
were when i was just wandering
restlessly aimlessly seeking peace in
loveliness    its too bad you fancy
yourself in love with evanie for i
assure you she doesnt love you
thats not true he flared

she laughed and instantly her
touch of wistfullness was gone to
be replaced by wickedness

  be carefully she mocked or ill


startling stories

exact payment for that insult as well
but it was no lie

  he controlled his anger

  why do you say that

  because when i forced her to sleep
frightened as she was she didnt turn
to you she fought me herself if
she had loved you shed have instinct-
ively called you for help

  i dont believe you

  then youre a fool she observed
indifferently and turned from him
disinterestedly at the entry of two
servants bearing food

  they slipped a table between the
two and served a sumputous repast
with dishes connor failed to recog-
nize he ate hungrily but the princess
despite her professed hunger picked
and chose and ate scarcely anything
it was a silent meal but afterward
smoking one of the black magically
lighted cigarettes he prepared to ask
certain questions

  she forestalled him with green
eyes glowing sardonically she looked
straight at him

  why do you love evanie instead
of me she asked

  you because you are not what
i thought you were instead of being
pure and sweet you revel in evil
that is not hearsay it is the historical
record of your seven hundred years
for that i hate you thoroughly and
completely

  she narrowed her glorious eyes
then you hate without reason
she said am i not more powerful
than evanie more intelligent
stronger and even i think more
beautiful

  youre outrageously incredibly
fantistically beautiful he cried as
if the acknowledgement were
wrenched from him against his will
youre perhaps the most beautiful
woman since helen of troy and the
most dangerous and yet i hate you
why

  because of your lack of a little
factor called character i concede
your beauty and your brilliance but
evanie is sweet kind honest and lov-
able one loves character not char-
acteristics

  character she echocd you

know nothing of my character i have
a hundred characters no one can be
so gentle as i-nor so cruel

  the faintest ripple of a mocking
smile crossed her exquisite features
and then they were suddenly pure as
an angels without rising she kicked
the switch of a vision screen with a
dainty sandaled toe

  control she said as it glowed

a face appeared

  a vitergon set tell to this room
she said cryptically and then to con-
nor as the face vanished there is no
scanner here this chamber and
joaquins in the north tower are the
only two in urbs lacking them

  what of it

  it means thomas connor that we
are in utter privacy

  he frowned puzzled abruptly he
started back in his chair as a flash of
iridescence flickered a messenger
and almost with his start the thing
was upon him

  tell it creaked in his brain
tell tell tell tell

he sprang erect

take it off he roared

  when i have your knowledge of
venus his tormentor said carelessly

  take it off or-

  or what her smile was guileless
sweet innocent

  this he blazed and covered the
space between them in a bound his
right hand clutching the delicate
curve of her throat his left pressing
her shoulders fiercely down against
the cushions

  take it off he bellowed

  suddenly there was a sound behind
him the grating of doors and he was
torn away held by four grim-faced
guards of course the operator of
the messenger could hear his words
he should have remembered that

  the black flame pushed herself to a
sitting position and her face was no
angels but the face of a lovely demon
green hell glittered in her eyes but
she only reached shakily for the vision
switch

 tell control to release she
choked huskily and faced tom con-
nor
the black flame



  the messenger tingled and van-
ished the princess rose unsteadily
but her glorious eyes burned cold as
she snatched a weapon from the near-
est guard

  get out all of you she snapped
the men backed away connor faced
her

  i should have killed you he mut-
tered for humanitys sake

  yes you should have thomas con-
nor her tones were bitter cold
for then you would have died
quickly and mercifully for murder
but now-now you die in the way i
choose and it will be neither quick
nor merciful i cannot-her voice
shook-bear the touch of violence
her free hand rubbed her throat for
this-you suffer

  he shrugged it was worth it i
know your character now i no
longer have to guess

  mockery gleamed

  do you her face changed sud-
denly and again it was soft and pure
and wistful do you she repeated
in tones that were sad but held that
bell-like quality he so well remem-
bered you dont do you think the
black flame is the true margaret of
urbs do you realize what immor-
tality means her exquisite face was
unutterably mournful as she thrust
the weapon into her belt you think
its a blessing dont you you won
der dont you why joaquin has with-
held it from everybody

  yes i do i think its tyranny
its selfish

  selfish oh god her voice

shook why he withheld it from
his own mother blessing its a
curse i bear it out of my duty to
joaquin else id have killed myself
centuries ago i still may do you hear
i still may her voice rose

  appalled he stared at her

  why he cried

 you ask why seven hundred
years seven - hundred - years
denied love how do i dare love a
man who ages day by day until his
teeth yellow and his hair falls out and
hes decrepit senile old denied
children immortals cant have child-
ren dont you think id trade im-
mortality for motherhood dont
you

  connor was speechless her voice
rose to a tense pitch

  do you know what seven hundred
years mean i do it means seven
centuries of friendlessness do you
wonder that i run away to the woods
sometimes seeking the companion-
ship the friendship the love that
everywhere else is denied me how
can i make friends among people who
vanish like ghosts who among the
dry scientists of the immortals is
alone - and im bored - bored -
bored her green eyes were tear-
bright but when he opened his lips
to speak she stopped him with an im-
perious gesture im sick to death
of immortality i want someone who
loves me someone id love to grow
old with and children to grow up be-
side me i want-i want-a friend

a wire basket by the elevator

  hand it to me said the flame
coolly

  he snatched it and thrust it at her
in a turmoil of emotion as he watched
her read it

  indeed she murmured my es-
teemed brother orders me to keep well
away from you-which i shall not do
-and commands you to his quarters at
once she yawned take the ele-
vator to any floor below the tower and
ask a guard thats all

  yet as the cage dropped connor
could not forget that there had been
something wistful about the princess
at his last glimpse of her somehow
try as he would he couldnt hate her
quite whole-heartedly and he frowned
as he found his way to the west cham-
bers a guard admitted him to an
inner room and then retired quietly
leaving him facing the master who
sat behind a paper-littered desk

  well what do you think of me
the master greeted him abruptly

 connor was taken aback unpre-
pared for the question

  why he stammered what would
i naturally think of you you dragged
me back here by torture you nearly
killed evanie do you think i can
easily forget or forgive such things

  after all thomas connor you par-
ticipated in a revolt against me the
master said suavely you wounded
eleven of my men did the govern-
ments of your day deal so leniently
with treason

  ive wondered why you are so easy
on the rebels he admitted frank-
ly in my time thered have been a
good many of us lined up against a
wall and shot

  the master shook his head why
should i do that the weeds are the
finest of my people i made the only
mistake-that of giving leisure to a
race not ready for it leisure is
whats bred all these minor revolu-
tions but does a father kill his fa-
vorite children

  does a son kill his mother re-
torted connor

  the master smiled bleakly

  i see my sister has been talking to
you yes i refused immortality to
my mother she was an old woman-
ill infirm should i have condemned
her to added centuries of misery
immortality does not restore youth
the point was incontrovertible
yet you withhold it from those
who have youth connor protested
you keep it selfishly as a reward to
bind to yourself all men of ability
youve emasculated the rest of hu-
manity

  you feel that immortality is a
highly desirable reward dont you
i do in spite of what your sister
says

  you dont understand said the
master patiently well pass the
question of its desirability it doesnt
matter but suppose i were to open it
to the race to instruct all the doctors
in its secrets wouldnt it immedi-
ately halt all development how can
evolution function if no one dies and
no children are born

  that was a puzzler

  you could permit it after the birth
of children connor said

  i could but at the present birth-
the black flame



rate the land areas would provide bare
standing room in just a century and a
half i could then kill off nine-tenths
of the population presumably but
what of the famines and food short-
ages intervening

connor was silent for a long mo-
ment

  the faults with immortality it-
self he burst out vehemently men
should never have learned that se-
cret

  but they have learned it would
you have me destroy the knowledge
because fools envy it-and envy it
mistakenly

 did you summon me here merely
to justify your acts tom connor
snapped in reply

  exactly you possess knowledge
invaluable to me id like to convince
you of my sincerity

  you never will

  see here said the master still in
tones of calm gravity dont ever
doubt that i could steal your knowl-
edge i know ways to encompass it
and if i failed others would not fail
the princess tried that said con-
nor grimly she will not try it
again he fingered a small bronze
bust on the desk before him and in-
cidentally whats to prevent me from
flinging this bronze through your
skull right now-killing you instead
of waiting for you to kill me

 your word to make no move
against me in the palace reminded
the master gently

  connors lips tightened in that
moment he realized suddenly what it
was that had perturbed him so vio-
lently he was beginning to believe
the master-and he didnt want to
the memory of the messengers tor-
ture was too recent the picture of
evanies helplessness was too burn-
ing he was being won over against
his will but-

  you win he growled releasing
the bust go ahead tell me what
all this is leading up to you must
have some objective other than the in-
definite perpetuation of your own
power

  the master smiled i have i plan

the ultimate destiny of mankind he
held up a hand to still connors quick
unbelieving protest listen to me
i have bred out criminals by steriliz-
ing for many centuries those with
criminal tendencies i have raised the
general level of intelligence by steril-
izing the feeble-minded the incompe-
tent if we have fewer supreme gen-
iuses than your people we have at
least no stupid nor insane-and gen-
ius will come

  i try to the best of my knowledge
to improve the race i think im suc-
ceeding at least were far advanced
over the barbarians of the dark cen-
turies and even i believe over the
average of your mighty ancient peo-
ple i think were happier he
paused do you

  in a way connor conceded but
even happiness isnt always a fair ex-
change for-liberty

  liberty suppose i granted lib-
erty suppose i abdicated how
long do you think it would be before
every sort of weed village was at war
with every other sort do you want
the world to break up into another
welter of quarreling little nations
thats what i found out of it ive
created an empire

  he drummed a finger on the desk
thoughtfully eyeing connor

  moreover ive preserved what dif-
ferences i could the yellow race
was a remnant ive bred it strong
again the red race was gone but
the black is growing and the tag-
ends of nations - ive nourished
them

ffwmhy connor demanded

   ww differences are only
grounds for future trouble arent
they

  civilization grows out of differ-
ences no race can produce a high
culture by itself there must be an
exchange of ideas and that means that
there must be differences

  youre very sure arent you
connor taunted

  ive spent centuries thinking of it
im confident ive found the truth
and i do the best i can

  i wish- connor paused i wish


startling stories

i could believe you

  you can i never lie

  i almost feel i can youre not the
mocking devil your sister is i rather
like you

  a queer smile flickered on the mas-
ters lips

  i have instructed her to cease tor-
menting you i assume she has been
but shell keep away from you here-
after    wont you my dear
connor spun around lounging
carelessly in the far doorway a half-
smoked cigarette in her hand was the
exquisite form of margaret of urbs

  perhaps she drawled slowly and
advanced leisurely into the room seat-
ing herself casually on the desk re-
gardless of its litter of papers

  joaquin she remarked this man
neglects to kneel in my presence in
yours as well i perceive shall i
command him

  try commanding the statue of
olin snapped connor

  we could persuade him insinu-
ated the princess after all evanie
sair is our hostage

  be still the master said sharply
you know i never impose a custom
on those who reject it

  the princess turned taunting eyes
on tom connor and was silent with
your permission i should like to re-
tire he said we seem to have cov-
ered the ground

not entirely said the master
what more do you want of me
two things first your knowl-
edge your understanding of the an-
cicnt mathematics and whatever else
we need

 granted-on condition at the
masters inquiring look he said bold-
ly on condition that any knowledge
i impart be made public you have
enough secrets-though some of them
are apt not to remain so

  ill agree the master said
promptly that was always my in-
tention but what secret of mine is in
danger of exposure

  connor laughed what else was it
you wanted of me

  your blood your strain in the
race like an infusion of bulldog blood
to give greyhounds courage i want

you to marry and have children
and that said connor bluntly is
my personal business i refuse to
promise that

  well the master genially re-
marked well let nature take itb
course ill trade you that indulgence
for the revelation of what secret you
suspect

  done its the triangle rocket-
blasts

  the rocket-blasts

  yes ive heard your craft in flight
ive listened to the blasts he turned
sardonic eyes from the master to the
princess the blast isnt steady it
throbs do you understand it
throbs

the masters face was stern
well

  t know you cant control the rate
of power youve had the whole world
looking for a means of controlling the
rate thats impossible hydrogen
has its natural period like radium
you can release the energy at that
single rate or all at once as in our
rifles-but you cant control it other-
wise 

  there was silence

  i know what you do in the blast
you detonate your water-a little at a
time in an enormously strong firing
chamber and release the blast gradu-
ally its no more continuous than the
power of a gasoline engine

  youre endangering your life
whispered the master you cant
live now

 with her satanic majesty the
goddess of mockery to intercede for
me connor jeered staring steadily
into the gray-green eyes of the prin-
cess in her features now was no
slightest trace of a taunt but some-
thing more like admiration if im
to die it had better be here and now
else ill find a way to tell what i
know

  here and now said margaret of
urbs

 not yet said the master
thomas connor long ago in my
youth i knew men like yeu theyre

dead and its a great loss to the world
but youre living i dont want to
the black flame



kill you id rather trust the fate of
my empire to your word having
heard my side then will you swear
allegiance to me

  no im not sure of your sincere-
ity

  if you were would you

  gladly i see more with you than
with the weeds

  then will you swear not to oppose
me until such time as you are sure
and will you swear to keep that
knowledge you have to yourself
fair enough connor said and
grinned he took the bronzed hand
the master extended i swear it
he glanced coolly at the princess
and by the three kinds of meta-
morphs im glad to swear it

  two kinds corrected the master
mildly panate and amphimorph
but margaret of urbs caught his
meaning a faint trace of anger
glinted in her eyes

  the immortals she said coldly
do not consider themselves meta-
morphs

 then i dont consider myself
irish said thomas connor any
freak that comes out of martin sairs
ray is a metamorph to me

  enough said the master thats
all connor

  but at the door the princess halted
connor and he gazed down into her
upturned face

  do you believe she said coldly
that joaquins promise will protect
you-or evanie sair-from me i
have my own debt to collect from
you

  he glanced back at the impassive
figure at the desk

  i traded my knowledge for your
word he called to the master is it
good

  i am the master said that indi-
vidual calmly

  connor gazed again at the perfect
features of the flame slowly he
raised his hand holding her eyes with
his and then with a sharp gesture
he snapped his finger stingingly
against her dainty nose grinned and
strode away

  at the outer door he turned the
black flame her lovely face a pale

mask of fury held a beam-pistol in her
hand but she made no move as he
grinned back at her behind her the
master smiled cryptically down at the
point of his pen

 but back in his room an amazing
realization came to connor under
the guise of his mildness the master
had won every single point he had
extracted from connor the promise of
his knowledge the promise of secrecy
concerning the triangle blasts his
alienation from the weed cause and
more than half an oath of allegiance
to himself

 and all for-what the right of
thomas connor to bear his own chil-
dren and the same promise of safety
given at their earlier meeting

  he swore softly and lay thinking of
the mocking loveliness of the black
flame

chapter xviii
the sky-rat

connor awoke fully rested with
the ache from muscles strained
by evanies weight almost vanished
he arose bathed donned his glitter-
ing urban costume and looked into
evanies room

  the girl was awake at last and ap-
parently well on toward recovery he
breathed a deep sigh of relief at
least in one matter then the unpre-
dictable princess had been sincere

 evanie he murmured are you
really all right are you better
she smiled and nodded i feel al-
most myself

 well we misjudged the princess
in one respect then ill have to thank
her for pulling you through
evanies eyes widened in horror
thank her what do you mean
tom-have you-did you see her
while i-

  he was taken aback

why i had dinner with her
after i warned you she wailed
i tell you shes like a madness that
gets into your blood a man cant even
look at her without suffering-and


startling stories

shes cruel and utterly inhuman she
compressed her lips firmly and whis-
pered 

  theres a scanner here-right un-
der the light i mustnt talk like this
who cares she wont get into
my blood evanie ive met only two
immortals the master i like the
princess-i hate

  see she whispered you like
the master tom hes as bad as the
princess hes subtle scheming in-
sidious his charm is poisonous
dont let him talk you over-please
he was startled at her vehemence
but the master had his word now
could he break it he was more than
half convinced of the great rulers sin-
cerity after all evanie was only a
sweet impulsive country girl whose
grandfather had been killed some-
thing of his thoughts must have shown
in his expression for her face grew
suddenly hard

  if i believed you were turning
away from us to them she said
tensely id despise you tom but
i believe in you believe youre
strong enough to resist the trickery of
the immortals dont fail me

  he could not answer her then for
the maid sora came in with a tray of
food she placed it on a cleverly con-
structed swinging arm that held it
above the bed it was a silent meal
soras presence put a restraint on
them and evanie was cold eyeing
connor suspiciously

  he was relieved when they finished
and the woman departed with the tray
he found a box of the magically self-
lighting cigarettes and puffed mood-
ily while evanie watched him in si-
lence

  a rap sounded a palace guard en-
tered bowed and handed connor a
tiny package and an envelope sealed
with the imprint of the midgard ser-
pent and departed

  connor broke the seal and slipped a
card from within read it and whis-
tled there was a queer expression on
his face when he handed it to evanie
written on it in script as fine and pre-
cise as engraving were the two sen-
tences 

  we desire your presence at once in our
laboratory in the east chambers show our
medallion to the guard at your door

  margarita urbis regina sororque do-
mini

the royal we it was no invita-
tion but a command connor
stared at evanie who stared back with
narrowed eyes

  well he said at last

 well

  what can i do ignore it and ex-
pose both of us to her anger-if shes
such a devil as you say

 oh go snapped evanie you
and your ancient strength and cour-
age youre like any other man be-
fore the black flame of urbs-just a
fool go

 and leave you

  ill have sora for company she
retorted go ahead burn yourself
at the flame and see if i care

  i dont see what else i can do than
go he muttered unhappily

 he turned moodily to the door
stripping the wrapper from the tiny
package a beautifully cast golden
disc lay in his hand with the pure fea-
tures of the princess in high relief

 the guard outside challenged him
at once it gave him a grim pleasure
to flash the medallion in the fellows
face to see him salute amazedly and
step aside connor took the elevator
to the ground floor and passed mood-
ily into the vast cavity of the throne
room

 he passed through martin sairs
disorderly chamber and finally to his
destination margaret of urbs sat
with a glass of purple wine in one
hand and the inevitable cigarette in
the other her dainty sandaled feet on
a soft footstool she wore urban
dress of glistening silver above which
her black hair gleamed like metal she
gave him a sardonic smile

  you may kiss my sandal she said

  or the hem of your skirt he re-
torted why did you send me that
note

  she gestured at the vision screen
beside her

 mostly to watch you and evanie
quarrel over it

 then you know my opinion of
the black flame



you

  yes i was rather amused

 well if youve ceased to be
amused may i go back

  not immediately said the prin-
cess dont you think i owe you a
little amusement in return

  ill forgive the obligation

  but im very circumspect about my
debts she insisted with that madden-
ing twinkle of mockery in the eyes
that dared him isnt there anything
about the palace-or in the world-
that interests you ill take you
sightseeing

it was an opportunity at that
there certainly was much he
would like to see in this world that
had grown up a thousand years after
he was born he hesitated the inky-
haired girl gestured at a chair and he
sat down without permission he
poured himself a goblet of the wine
beside her it was quite different
from the still wines of ormon sweet
sparkling rich-and potent

  id like to see eartheye he said
musingly

  oh asias too far she quickly
protested im only giving you an
hour or so

  lets have something on the vision
screen from eartheye then he sug-
gested how about mars

  well its night over asia she
snapped the screen on with a negli-
gent hand and said eartheye in a
moment a bearded face appeared with
a respectful salute put on mars
she drawled the central region of
solis lacus

  in a moment a rosy glow suffused
the screen resolving into focus as a
ruddy plain with a greenish center
connor gazed spellbound the planet
of mystery at a distance of two miles

  enigmatical dark spots of strangely
suggestive regularity were distin-
guishable a lacy tracery of cabalistic
lines the flash of something bright
that might be water a pygmy civil-
ization he wondered dizzily

  id like to see that at first hand
he murmured

 so would i said margaret of
urbs ive tried to talk my esteemed

brother into permission to make the
attempt without success so far
you he remembered his con-
versation with evanie and jan orm
but its two and a half years there
and back

  whats two and a half years to
me she snapped off the screen
come on she said rising

  where now

  for a little flight ill show you a
triangle-she glanced at him with a
mocking smile-since you know their
secret-and yet live

  no thanks to you connor flashed
at her

  no were you frightened

  did i seem so

  she shook her head

  are you ever afraid

  often i try not to show it

  i never am she said pulling a
beam-pistol from a table drawer and
snapping it to her waist since were
leaving the palace she explained i
intend to bring you back

 he laughed and followed her
through the throne room and up to a
portion of the vast palace roof below
the south tower a triangle stood
there on a metal flooring he noticed
the pitting and excoriations where the
blast had struck the vehicle gleamed
silver far smaller than the giant ones
he had seen in flight connor glanced
curiously at the firing chamber at the
apex then at the name sky-rat en-
graved on the wall

 my sky-ratsaid margaret of
urbs the swiftest thing yet made by
man your bullets are laggards beside
it she hesitated and for a moment
he could have sworn that there was a
touch of shyness in her eyes i took
one trip in this-not so long ago she
said softly that i will never forget
the woods of ormon are-lovely-
dont you think

  he made no answer to that and fol-
lowed her in the tubular chamber
was luxuriously fitted with deep
cushioned seats and room enough for
comfortable sleeping quarters when
they were seated she depressed a lever
and the throbbing roar of the blast
began

  through the floor-port he watched


startling stories

the palace drop away urbs major
unrolled beneath there was a sensa-
tion of weight as the vehicle shot up-
ward like an errant meteor

  frightened laughed the prin-
cess

  connor shrugged ive flown be-
fore he said laconically

 oh-airplanes wait

chapter xix
death flight

minute by minute the earth re-
ceded it seemed not so much
to drop as to diminish as if the sur-
face were condensing like a deflating
balloon urbs minor slipped smoothly
into the square of vision and the whole
panorama of the mighty city was be-
low-greater and lesser urbs with
the gash of the canal between them
tiny as a toy village in the swiss alps

  kaatskill slid into the square and a
dozen other previously unseen sub-
urbs of the vast metropolis the as-
piring towers of the palace were small
as pins in a carpet and already a lit-
tle east of them as their radial flight
permitted the earths rotation to
gain on the craft

  the earth began to seem hazy and
off to the north a snow-white plain of
clouds glistened the vast bowl of
the planet began slowly to hump in
the center it was inverting beginning
to seem spherical

  tom connor jumped violently as a
spark crackled off his thumb a sec-
ond stung the tip of his nose the
black silken hair of the princess rose
queerly in a cloud about the perfec-
tion of her face and sparks raced
along the metal of the hull

  the heaviside ionization layer
she murmured scared

  no

  margaret of urbs glanced at a dial

  thirty thousand now

  feet

  she laughed meters

  about twenty mile and they were

still accelerating the surface below
flowed continually inward the sky

darkened a star appeared-another
fifty stars a thousand-all glistening
in a black sky where the sun blazed
blue-white the earth was decidedly
globular now the vast inconceivable
slope of the planet could be seen in all
directions

 unconsciously connor jumped as
suddenly there came a sharp patter
like hail

  meteoric particles said the girl
turning a knob paige deflector
she explained

  for meteors as well as bullets eh
he suggested

  for the iron ones a stone might
get through

 uncomfortable thought minutes
passed-half an hour suddenly the
princess moved something connor
was nearly lifted from his seat by the
sudden lightness

  deceleration she said glancing
down at the colossal convexity below
three hundred miles are you
frightened

  do you think so

  she smiled a taunt ill turn off the
deflectors she murmured

  there was a pattering roar some-
thing crashed glancingly above him
and the floor tipped and spun like a
jugglers platter margaret of urbs
laughed

 might i ask the object he
queried

  yes she said gently im going
to commit suicide

  as he caught his breath sharply un-
believingly she moved the lever be-
fore her and the throbbing roar of
the blast died suddenly the sensa-
tion of dizziness that followed was a
thousand times worse than that con-
nor had experienced in the swift pal-
ace elevators

  he was utterly weightless they
were in a free fall

  the princess was laughing at him
deep in those lustrous inhumanly
lovely sea-green eyes of hers was the
glint of mockery

  scared she whispered as she had
dene repeatedly and gave a low rip-
pling chuckle at his silence three
hundred miles she jeered a mo-
ment passed two hundred
the black flame



he couldnt shift his gaze from the
satanic beauty of her face but
he grimly fought his quivering lips to
firmness there was a low whine out-
side that rose abruptly to a screaming
shriek that went gibbering across the
world the air they had struck the
atmosphere

  the floor grew warm almost hot-it
burned at last connor tore his eyes
from the face of the princess and
gazed down at the up-rushing planet

  they were over ocean what mat-
ter at that speed it might as well be
concrete how high two miles-
a mile less each succeeding second
the scream was a great roaring now

  were going to crash he said
evenly knowing she couldnt hear
him

  margaret of urbs kicked a lever
with a daintily casual foot the blast
roared out-too late or was it ir-
resistible weight oppressed connor as
the sea rushed upward so close it
was now that he saw the very waters
hollowed by the blast that near

  but far enough they were reced-
ing until the girl cut the blast again
and set the rocket gently on the heav-
ing swells of the pacific

  connor gulped

  nice flying he said steadily
how often can you do it

  i dont know she laughed ive
never tried before scared the re-
iteration of that word was getting on
his nerves as greatly as had the speed
of the rocket

  did i show it he asked

  im afraid not her voice changed
suddenly she rose whipped the
beam-pistol from her side if i cant
frighten you she said her eyes glit-
tering i can at least kill you the
beam flashed over him

  he took the shock unflinching she
slid her finger along the barrel until it
stabbed harder racking him he bit
his lips and gazed back into eyes now
deeply emerald and at last she
laughed and returned the weapon to
its place

  were all ancients like you tom
she murmured

  somehow he managed a calm reply

  some stronger some weaker he

said carelessly

  i think i could-love you she
whispered

  she thrust a hand suddenly toward
him and involuntarily he started

  afraid of one thing at least arent
you she jeered afraid of-me

 without warning he caught her
arm swept her suddenly to him he
pressed a fierce kiss on the perfection
of her lips she yielded instantly re-
turning the caress for a moment her
lips burned against his like strong
wine and lights coruscated in his
spinning brain with the black
flame of urbs in his arms the world
seemed to fall away as it had from
the rising triangle

  he felt her lips move against his
heard her murmur tom tom i
do love you say you love me

 love you love you he said
but just in time he caught that fa-
miliar gleam of mockery in her eyes
yes he said just as i love a drink
of strong liquor

  he pushed her roughly away grin-
ning sardonically margaret of urbs
laughed but he fancied there was a
quaver in her laughter it was the
first time he had seen the diamond
hardness of her poise so much as ruf-
fled that is since he had seen her in
her robe of cruel princess the role she
had played for seven hundred years
when he had seen her as a child of
the woods she had been different

but she quickly regained her hard
control over herself she
slapped a trifle viciously at the con-
trols and the sky-rat soared away
from a boiling circle of ocean toward
urbs

  arrived there the princess said not
a word but left tom connor at once
he wandered irresolutely to his room
and opened evanies door she sat
propped against some cushions while
a man in the garb of a palace servant
leaned above her both turned star-
tled faces toward him in amazement
he recognized the man as jan orm of
ormon

 tom connor opened his mouth to
cry an involuntary greeting to jan
orm but checked it at the sight of


startling stories

jans warning look and a gesture from
evanie of course jan was here in
disguise and there was the scanner
with unwinking eye and attentive ear
connor advanced to the side of ev-
anies bed and bent over her

  dont look at jan when you talk
she said softly

  i wont lord im glad to see you
jan i didnt know what might have
happened to you

  im working in the kitchen whis-
pered jan nodding at a tray on the
wall-arm he added eagerly tom
you can help us we need you
help you to what

  to finish- jan began but evanie
interrupted help me to escape she
whispered then shot a glance at jan
orm be careful of him jan she
warned hes been around the black
flame

  connor reddened look here he
muttered heres exactly how i
stand for safetys sake ive sworn
to the master to make no move against
him for the present and to tell him
what i know of mathematics that
cant hurt you can it evanies safety
is worth more to me than that

  he caught a sidelong flash of jans
face gone suddenly blank jans lips
tightened grimly

  whats the value of an oath to the
master he growled that neednt
bind you

  i keep my word connor said as
grimly

  but your oath doesnt keep you
from helping me to escape does it
whispered evanie

  i guess not-but whats the use of
it to suffer another messenger

  this time declared evanie ill
fight off any messenger i was worn
out before exhausted almost help-
less

  what can i do asked connor a
little reluctantly

  are you free to move as you will
about the palace

  not entirely

  well i want to see the master i
must see him

  why dont you call him and ask for
an interview connor asked that
seemed simple enough

  i have all i can get is a statement
from the vision room that hes busy in
his quarters and cant come im not
supposed to leave my bed you know
she paused its probably true jan
has heard that theres a conclave of
the immortals of the south day after
tomorrow she glanced at connor
imploringly cant you get me to
him tom please-i must see him

  connor smiled amused as a swift
thought crossed his mind margaret
of urbs must indeed have been per-
turbed this morning she had forgot-
ten to reclaim her medallion if he
were to use it before she remem-
bered-

  perhaps i can help you reach him
evanie he whispered if youll
come at once

       chapter xx
       the conspirators

the guards passed them without
question with only a glance at the
medallion

 when they reached the anteroom
beyond the arch they at once saw the
master at his littered desk evanie
dropped gracefully to one knee as
they neared the ruler but connor
stood erect and stared at margaret of
urbs who sat in a chair by the win-
dow a book on her lap a black cigar-
ette in her fingers spiraling smoke as
she stared back at him

  the masters eyes flickered over
them

 may i ask how you two managed
to arrive here he inquired mildly

  connor tossed the medallion on the
desk and his lips twisted in wry
amusement when he saw the quivering
start that twitched the dainty lips of
the princess she arose quickly and
moved to the masters side she and
evanie gazed at each other across the
desk the eyes of margaret of urbs
were faintly disdainful but evanies
were hostile

  it was tom connors first oppor-
tunity to make a first-hand comparison
of the two he hated himself for
the black flame



making it but here it was thrust upon
him

  the princess was a trifle taller a bit
more slender than evanie and infi-
nitely more beautiful lovely as ev-
anie was it wasnt fair connor told
himself bitterly-terribly unfair in
fact to compare evanies beauty with
the unearthly beauty of the black
flame of urbs it was like contrast-
ing the simple loveliness of a wild rose
to the splendor of an orchid or a
brown milkweed butterfly to a star-
flying luna moth

  the master spoke

  i presume you have a reason for
coming

  yes said evanie i cant stand
it-being imprisoned in a single room
i had to see you her lips quivered
she was a consummate actress con-
nor suddenly realized you know i
-i have-metamorphic blood in me
you know what that means i have to
move about in the open to breathe air
that comes from the sky not from pal-
ace ventilators so ive come to ask
you for a little freedom just permis-
sion to walk now and then in the inner
gardens

 connors wondered how walking in
the square of the inner gardens could
encompass her escape since the pal-
ace surrounded it

  it is my intention to release you
but not yet the master said not
until i have had what i wish from
thomas connor

  but i cant stand it the girl
pleaded tremulously

  the master turned to connor

  remembering your oath he said
do you second this request this is
no move against me

  i do not break my word connor
said

  well i see no harm in it the
master called a few syllables into the
box beside him then spoke to evanie
you have the liberty of the halls and
the inner gardens-no more as for
you-his eyes flickered over connor
-apparently you manage without
my permission thats all

  evanie dropped again to her knee
rose and moved toward the archway
as connor followed the master

called

  not you thomas connor

  connor turned again toward the

faintly amused face of the ruler

  i perceive the master said that
my sister has disobeyed me

  the princess laughed in that mock-
ing way of hers

  do i ever obey you joaquin

  nominally at times he paused
studying his sister coolly for a mo-
ment then again turned his attention
to the man before him as you may
know he remarked i have sum-
moned a conclave for day after to-
morrow i am completely occupied
but i do not forget your promise
thomas connor nor have i lost in-
terest in the stores of ancient knowl-
edge therefore you will accompany
the princess to the chambers behind
the throne room and fulfill your
promise by explaining to her as much
as time permits of mathematics par-
ticularly of the meaning of logarithms
and of the device i have heard termed
the slide-rule she will understand
you thats all

he met the eyes of the princess
i may obey you this time
joaquin she said and moved out of
the door

  connor followed her the halls be-
trayed the activity of the coming con-
clave and were more crowded than
he had observed before twice grave-
faced long-haired immortals passed
them raising respectful hands in sa-
lute to margaret of urbs

  she turned into the south corridor

  this isnt the way he objected

  were going to the tower she
glanced sideward at him youll see
soon why the palace needs all its size
therell be twenty thousand immor-
tals here and we have room for all
of them-half the immortals in the
world

  half evanie said there were three
million

  she gave him an inscrutable smile

  it does no harm to let the weeds
over-estimate our strength

  then why tell me

  her smile was the unfathomable one
of the mona lisa


startling stories

  i never do anything without rea-
son was her only reply

  he laughed when once again they
reached the aspiring pinnacle of the
tower without a glance at the mighty
city below the princess pulled pen
and paper from a table seated herself
and faced connor

  well  she queried begin

  he did it was a new margaret of
urbs he saw now unkown before
save possibly in that brief moment
when he had mentioned the venus of
milo or when earlier in the woods she
had shown him how vast was her
knowledge of and interest in history
and world events

  she was eager curious questioning
avid for knowledge and uncannily
quick to comprehend there were
queer gaps in her learning often he
had to stop to explain terms utterly
elementary while at other times she
followed him through the most com-
plex maze of reasoning without a
question

  the afternoon waned dusk crept
over the great vista and at length she
threw down her pen

  enough she said we must have
ten-place logarithm tables worked
out theyll be priceless at earth-
eye not until then did a trace of
mockery creep in to her voice i sup-
pose you realize she taunted that
once we have your knowledge all rea-
son to keep you alive is gone but the
reasons to kill you remain

  he laughed

  youd like to frighten me wouldnt
you havent you tried that often
enough the master trusts my word
i trust his-but not yours his lips
twisted had i not trusted him i
could have escaped this morning
what was to prevent me from taking
your weapon away dropping you on a
deserted shore-or even kidnapping
you-and escaping in the sky-rat
i never promised not to escape what
kept me here was my trust in his word
and a desire to see this game played
out

  there is no safety anywhere in the
world for you thomas connor said
the flame softly except in my favor
and why you still live is a mys-

tery so much so that i wonder at it
i have never before been so indulgent
to one i hate she flashed her glo-
rious emerald eyes to his face do i
hate you

  you should know hatred better
than i

 yes-and yet i wonder she
smiled slowly if ever i love the way
i hate not death itself could thwart
me but there is no man strong
enough to conquer me

  or perhaps he retorted that one
isnt interested

she smiled again with almost a
trace of wistfulness

  youre very strong she admitted
i should have loved to have lived in
your ancient days to have lived
among your great fighters and great
makers of beauty at least those were
men-your ancients i could have
loved one of those

  and havent you he asked ironi-
cally ever loved a man

  he could detect no mocking note in
her voice

  loved i have thought myself in
love a hundred times at least a dozen
times i have gone to joaquin to beg
immortality for some man i have
loved but joaquin swore to martin
sair long ago to grant it only to those
worthy of it and he has kept that
oath

  she smiled wryly it takes all a
mans youth to prove himself worthy
and so the immortals are all dry scien-
tists-not to my taste joaquin re-
fused me each time i asked for the
favor wanting to know if i were sure
id never tire of him for whom i
begged-to swear i was sure and of
course i couldnt swear she paused
thoughtfully he was always right
too every time i did tire even be-
fore old age blighted them

  and what did you do to prove your
self worthy connor mocked

  im serious today the princess
said im not teasing now i think
i could love you thomas connor
thank you he grinned suspect-
ing the glitter in the green eyes
though he did not see it in my time
it was the custom for the man to make
the black flame



such declarations

 your time flared margaret of
urbs what do i care for your ante-
diluvian customs and prehistoric prej-
udices would you have the black
flame as shrinking and modest as lit-
tle evanie pretends to be

  id dislike you less if you were
you dont dislike me youre
merely afraid of me because i repre-
sent everything you hate in a woman
-and yet you cant hate me indeed
i rather think you love me

  he laughed mocking now himself
im margaret of urbs she flashed
what do i want of you nothing
i dont really want you at all tom
connor youd be like all the others
youd age those mighty limbs of
yours will turn skinny or else fat
and bloated those clear eyes will be
pale and watery your teeth will yel-
low and your hair fall out and then
youll be gone

  she pulled a cigarette from the box
and blew a plume of smoke in his im-
passive face

 go brag of this when we release
you-if we do go tell it up and down
the world that you alone of all men
were strong enough to reject the love
of margaret of urbs go say that the
black flame failed to scorch you-
failed even to warm you her voice
quivered and go say too that no
other man save you ever learned-
how unhappy-she is

  the deep eyes were tear-bright he
stared into them perplexed was this
merely more acting was there noth-
ing left of margaret of urbs save a
lovely masque and a thousand poses-
no real being within he forced a
sardonic grin to his lips-forced it
for the impossible beauty of the girl
tore at him despite his will

at his smile her face darkened
and then say she said from
between tight lips that the black
flame doesnt care what talk you make
of her because she burns on while
you-and those you talk to-in so
very few years will be dust dust
again he laughed at her and the
flame turned suddenly away

 i suppose you may go now she

said dully

  but connor hardly heard her he
was caught in speculatigns concern-
ing the strange black and golden soul
of the princess baffling hateful fas-
cinating to the point of deadliness
and yet - somehow wistful almost
pitiful it was almost he thought as
if in the glimpse he had caught of her
in the freedom of the woods he had
seen the true soul of the woman and
all the rest was masquerading

  he stared across at the glory of her
face now subdued to sadness as she
gazed out at a million lighted win-
dows then a flicker of motion caught
his eye far far beneath him in the
well of shadows in the inner gardens

  someones in the gardens he ob-
served absently

   oh said the princess listlessly it
must be an antarctic immortal enjoy-
ing a garden under the sky she
clicked the vision screen garden
she ordered dully north bank of the
pool

  a burst of choked laughter startled
him he swung about there shown
on the screen before his eyes was
evanie seated on a garden bench her
head on the shoulder of jan orm his
arm about her waist

  a waiter the black flame said
scornfully a palace waiter

  but despite her laughter and his
own confusion connor did not fail to
notice that there were still tears in
her eyes

chapter xxi
the dinner at the sleepers

cqnnor awoke late next morning
and to an instant memory of the
shock he had experienced at the sight
of evanie and jan orm most of the
night he had spent in improvising pos-
sible excuses for the girl perhaps it
was an innocent scene he had wit-
nessed

  after all she and jan were lifelong
friends born and raised in ormon and
it might be that evanie had turned to
him in loneliness even in pique at his


startling stories

tom connors own involuntary attend-
ance on margaret of urbs but the
mocking suggestions of the princess
and the memory of evanies contented
face in the vision screen-those trou-
bled him and he remembered too
jans confession that he loved evanie

  dressing he glimpsed her far below
in the inner gardens with her bronze
hair glinting she was lying at full
length on the grass he forgot break-
fast and hurried into the corridor
where the guard remembering the me-
dallion of the princess merely sa-
luted respectfully unaware that con-
nor no longer possessed the disc of
gold

  he descended at once to the ground
level followed an interminable pas-
sage toward the palaces center and
flung open a door at its end instead
of daylight a dim-lit chamber with
glowing walls lay beyond wherein
after a moment of blinking he de-
scried a row of perhaps twenty men
some stared at him surprised but
most kept their eyes fixed steadily on
the shining wall

  im sorry he said to the nearest
man i was looking for the gardens

  unexpectedly a voice spoke beside
him

  the gardens are two stories above
us thomas and i see you still wan-
der

  it was the tall ebony-haired master
beside him was another immortal
grave-eyed and sandy-haired

  this is thomas connor said the
master our storehouse of ancient
knowledge thomas this is martin
sair here from austropolis he
added thomas is one of those who
affect not to kneel in our presence i
indulge him

  indulgence is a habit of yours ur-
banus rumbled the sandy-haired man
does the princess also-indulge

  not willingly margaret is having
one of her restless years im afraid
he frowned but they pass-they
pass look there thomas he ges-
tured toward the wall this is our
seeing room here is focused every
scanner in urbs-in any of my cities
if i wish if the palace is the worlds
brain this room it the visual center

  connor took his eyes from a fasci-
nated scrutiny of the legendary martin
sair the giver of life and glanced
at the walls millions of tiny pictures
covered them each small as a thumb-
nail glowing some in colors and some
when the distant origin was in dark-
ness in the dull blue-gray of the short
waves he saw flickers of movement
as the pictured men and women went
about their daily business

  we can enlarge any scene there
said the master pointing at a row of
wider screens some even now illu-
mined in this room i can follow a
mans life from birth to death so long
as he remains in one of my cities he
paused musingly then shrugged the
gardens are two floors above us
thomas

it was dismissal connor cast a last
glance at martin sair feeling as
if he were gazing on a demigod mar-
tin sair the giver of life greatest
except the master among all the he-
roic figures in the dazzling age of the
enlightenment then he backed away
from the great immortal and betook
himself to the gardens

  evanie was there lovely as a bit
of the ancient statuary that dotted the
square as she lay in the barbaric cos-
tume of urbs watching a twenty-inch
column of water slip smoothly from
the mouth of a giant stone lion she
gave connor a cool glance as he ap-
proached

  evanie he said unhappily ive
looked everywhere for you

  why she asked indifferently
to be with you of course you
know that

  i dont know it or has the flame
burned you at last

  her coolness baffled him

  evanie he pleaded why are you
so offended

 her mouth hardened youve de-
serted the weeds tom do you think
i could ever forgive that

  see here evanie he said hastily
theres one thing you seem to have
forgotten i was thrust in among the
weeds of ormon without choice
does that mean i have to accept your
social theories blindly perhaps im
the black flame



too primitive for anarchy-but i think
you are too he went on defiantly
i dont think your theories will work
and i do think the masters govern-
ment is what this world needs it
isnt perfect but its better than the
weeds offer-and even for you
evanie i wont give up freedom of
thought

 you mean you wont think she
blazed youre not fooling me tom
i know the way the black flame poi-
sons men and youve been with her
too often  youve been burned and-
her anger mounted oh go away

  evanie he began earnestly and
paused was he untouched by the
devastating charm of the princess
the dizzying warmth of her lips his
reeling brain in the hour on the pa-
cific- shes the daughter of hell
he muttered

 go away flared evanie quit-
ter

  hot words rose to his lips but he
suppressed his anger even as the pic-
ture he had seen of jan and evanie
flashed on his mental screen and
turned away into the palace

  for an hour he stamped through the
endless halls now crowded with ar-
riving immortals from africa ant-
arctica australia and south america
now and again one turned cool eyes
on his forbidding countenance or
smiled gravely after him none
stopped or addressed him

 he must have completed the some-
what less than a mile of circuit several
times when a guard approached him
he turned a furious scowl on the fel-
low but he had only a tiny black en-
velope inscribed in white in the pre-
cise script of the princess connor
ripped the missive open a short note
was inside it read

  come to my chambers at half after the
seventh hour to escort me to dinner wear
the black costume in your quarters and the
black cape

margaret of urbs

 merely an invitation-but a royal
invitation is a command he laughed
bitterly why not the black flame
could burn no more painfully than she
had already and at least he could vent

his anger on her

although hours remained be-
fore the appointed dinner hour
he went back to his quarters glancing
indifferently at the urban formal
dress laid carefully on his bed it was
exactly like his present garb save that
it shimmered black with metallic
scales and was edged with silver
crossing to the window he sat staring
down at evanie in the gardens bath-
ing her rounded limbs in sunlight un-
til a man in urban dress who could
only be jan orm joined her he
turned angrily away then fuming

  with no breakfast or lunch he was
both short-tempered and ravenous so
when the hours had dragged by and
he finally located the chambers on the
hundred and seventh level of the
south tower he was in no pleasant
mood two armed guards stepped
aside and the serving woman sora
admitted him with a clumsy curtsy

  he passed into the anteroom fur-
nished as was the black flames lab-
oratory behind the throne room and
her place at the summit of the tower
lavishly and ornately but surprise
leaped to his eyes as he saw the gigan-
tic black persian cat that gazed stead-
ily at him with green eyes that seemed
almost a replica of those of the prin-
cess

  a cat he exclaimed i thought
they were extinct

  satan is immortal said the soft
voice of margaret of urbs

  he whirled and faced her as she
emerged from the inner chamber and
hunger and anger alike drained out of
him as he stared

  she was magnificent garbed in a
jet-black cape that dropped to her
green-crystaled sandals she seemed
taller as she advanced into the room
a circlet of green gems-emeralds
he thought-bound her ebony hair and
beneath it her eyes were smoldering
sea-green fire

  but he felt the thrill of surprised
shock as she threw open the cape her
brief kirtle and corselet glittered in a
solid surface of green gems and at her
waist sparkled that mystic crystalline
flower of many colors glistening from
startling stories

red to violet blue and purest emer-
ald then she moved toward the lamp
and in its yellow radiance her whole
costume was green no longer but the
deep lavender of wine

  alexandrites she laughed an-
swering his unspoken question
green by day lavender by artificial
light synthetic of course there
arent this many natural stones in the
world she turned like it
exquisite he whispered you
daughter of lucifer

  he followed her in rebellious fas-
cination as they progressed unat-
tended to the ground floor and into a
long palace car with stiff-backed
driver and footman

  merimees she said and the car
spun silently away mounting to the
upper tier of palace avenue

  it was dusk but now and then when
traffic slowed their motion cheers
sounded and many a glance was cast
at them margaret of urbs ignored
the glances but smiled at the cheers
whos merimee connor asked
a rich sleeper in kaatskill soci-
ety here is largely sleepers

  no nobility

  the immortals seldom entertain
were a serious lot

  kaatskill appeared and they glided
into the grounds of an imposing gre-
cian mansion lights were glowing
gay voices sounded as they entered

  there was a sudden silence as the
whole assemblage knelt margaret of
urbs gestured and the guests arose
merimee himself paunchy bald came
babbling his appreciation his grati-
tude for the honor to his house

  but the entertainment your high-
ness on such short notice you see
-best the bureau could furnish-i
know youll forgive-

declaration

the dinner was lavish connor
sat at the left of the princess
lines of servitors passed in a steady
stream bearing soups then fish-

bombay ducks pompano a dozen un-
known viands-and f o w -ortolan
ptarmigan pheasant and nameless
others

  connor was ravenous he sampled
everything and it was the middle of
the meal before he noticed the aghast
looks of the crowd and that he was
almost the only one who was eating

  have i violated the proprieties
he asked the princess

  youre supposed to eat only of the
dishes i taste she informed coolly

  but im hungry and youve eaten
practically nothing

  it was true margaret of urbs had
taken only a little salad though she
had sipped glass after glass of wine

  i like to tantalize these hogs she
replied in low but audible tones this
bores me

 then why come

  a whim

  he chuckled turning his atten-
tion to the entertainment this he
thought was excellent an incred-
ibly skilful juggler succeeded a tal-
ented magician a low-voiced woman
sang sweet and ancient tunes a trio
played tinkling melodies a graceful
pair of adagio dancers performed
breathtakingly in the square sur-
rounded by the tables and a contor-
tionist managed unbelievable bodily
tangles the performers came and
went in silence not one burst of ap-
plause rewarded them

  unappreciative audience con-
nor growled

 is it the princess drawled
watch

  the following number he thought
was the worst of the lot a fright-
ened dingy man with a half-trained
dancing monkey that chattered and
grimaced but made a sad failure of
the dancing yet at the conclusion
margaret of urbs raised her dainty
hands and applauded

  instantly bedlam broke loose ap-
plause crashed through the hall en-
cores were shouted and the aston-
ished player stumbled once more
through the ludicrous performance

  well his fortunes made ob-
served the princess nyork will
want him and chicago and singapore
the black flame



as well

the master of ceremonies was pre-
senting homero the poet of per-
sonalities a thin-faced urban
crowned with laurel leaves and bear-
ing a classical harp

he bowed and smiled

and who ladies and lords shall
it be of whom do i sing

her highness roared the crowd
the princess of urbs

homero strummed his harp and be-
gan chanting minstrel-like

the princess adjective and verb
turn feeble glorious superb

exquisite none of these can name
the splendor of the urban flame

our princess stars are loath to rise
lest they be faded by her eyes

yet once theyve risen they will not set

but gaze entranced on margaret

the continents and oceans seven
revolve beneath the laws of heaven

what limit law or cannon curbs

the tongue that speaks the flame of urbs

applause violent and enthu-
siatic greeted the doggerel
margaret of urbs lowered her eyes
and smiled

who now homero called of
whom do i sing

unexpectedly merimee spoke
tom connor he cried tom con-
nor the ancient

homero strummed his harp and
sang

ladies and lords you do me honor

giving the name of thomas connor

that ancient phoenixlike arisen
out of his cold sepulchral prison

thrust into life-a comet hurled
from the dead past into the world

what poet great enough to sing
the wonderful awakening

let golden science try explain
that miracle-and try in vain

for only art by heaven inflamed

can dream how death itself was tamed

hell turn this into some insipid
compliment to me whispered marga-

ret of urbs the poet of personali-
ties sang on

year after year the strong flesh mouldered
dim as the epark of life that smouldered-
until the princess glanced that way

and lo the cold and lifeless clay

to death and time no longer slave

burst out triumphant from the grave

  in the roar of applause connor sat
amazed at the reference to his own ex-
perience how did homero know
he turned to question the princess

  im tired of this she said and
rose to depart

  the whole body of guests rose with
her she drew her cape around her
and strode to the car

  slowly she ordered the driver
then leaned back gazing at connor
well she murmured

 interesting that homero-hes
clever

  bah stock verses composed be-
forehand

 but-about me

 dont you know youve been a
newspaper and vision sensation

  the devil connor was shocked

  this homero she went on mus-
ingly once long ago i knew so-
vern the only great poet of the en-
lightenment he who half seriously
half contemptuously named me the
black flame and the only man-save
you tom connor who ever flaunted
me to my face and one evening he
angered me and i exiled him from
urbs urbs that he loved-and too late
i found that his bitterness grew out
of a love for me

  so i called him back in time to die
when not even martin sair could save
him and dying he said to me-i re-
call it-i take my revenge in remem-
bering that you are human and to be
human is to love and suffer do not
forget it she paused nor have i

  and was it true asked connor
struck suddenly by this revelation of
the fiery imperious untameable char-
acter beside him

  i think lately that it is true she
murmured and drew a long breath i
have slain i have tortured for less
violence than you have committed
against me


startling stories

  she flung open her cape baring the
marks of his fingers still on the ex-
quisite curve of her throat

  i cannot-suffer the touch of vio-
lence and yet you have struck me
twice and still live there is a magic
about you thomas connor some
laughing ancient strength that has
died out of the world i have never
feared anything in my life i have
never begged anyone-but i fear you
and i plead with you she swayed
against him kiss me she whis-
pered

he stared down at the unearthly
beauty of her face but there
was a green light in her eyes
that puzzled him coolly he fought
the fascination that was cast netlike
about him this was but another taste
of the torment she iad promised he
was sure of it

  i will not he said each time
i have kissed you you have laughed
at me

  but i will not laugh now
youll not trap me again by the
same trick he said find another
way for the torment you threatened
and when youre ready to kill me for
the violence i did you ill die laugh-
ing at you

  i have forgiven that she said
softly

  then he said mockingly heres
more to forgive

  he lifted her slender wrist in his
mighty hand circled it with his pow-
erful fingers and crushed it in a grasp
like contracting steel it gave him a
grim pleasure to thus vent his turbu-
lent emotions on her and to see her
face whiten under pain that must have
been excruciating but save for her
pallor she gave no sign of agony

  he dropped her hand ashamed of
his cruelty though it was not as if he
had used his strength against a mor-
tal woman margaret of urbs seemed
to him more of a female demon

  but she only said softly i thank
you for this it has taught me what
i wanted to know for any other than
you would now be dead for it i love
you tom

  flame he retorted while her

eyes widened the merest trifle at the
familiarity i dont believe you
but you must after all these
years upon years i am sure i swear it
tom say you love me

  i love-evanie but despite his
words the doubts that had been con-
stantly creeping in on him assailed
him evanie was still alien somehow

  you love me she murmured i
am the black flame yet i plead now
say it tom

  i love evanie

  then will you kiss me

  he stared down at her why not
he said savagely do you think im
afraid of you

  he spun her against him and her
lips burned against his

  say you love me she repeated in
a tense whisper say it

  i love- he began and the car slid
to a stop before the palace arch the
footman stood holding the car door
open

  margaret of urbs gazed as if dis-
traught from connors face to the si-
lent attendant and back again ab-
ruptly she thrust herself away her
mouth quivering

  i wish she said tensely i-wish
i had never seen you

  she struck him a sharp blow across
his mouth clambered unassisted to
the ground and disappeared into the
palace trailing her black cape behind
her

  back in his room again connor was
in a turmoil ashamed perplexed bit-
ter

 caught he swore fiercely
burned god what a fool-what
a weakling

  for call it what he would-it was
true fascination infatuation any-
thing-the fact faced him that the
black flame had burned evanie from
his heart he swore viciously and bat-
tered at evanies door

the blows echoed into silence
there was no response

 with a long-drawn sigh connor
turned away from evanies door
whether absent or simply ignoring
him she had failed him and he needed
her desperately now he wanted to
the black flame

quench the fires of the black flame
in her cool simplicity to reassure him-
self that what he now felt was an ob-
session an infatuation-anything but
love

  he wanted to convince himself it
was evanie he loved by telling her so
better never to have emerged from un-
der the prison than to live again lov-
ing a mask of beauty hiding a daugh-
ter of satan

  he strode to the casement overlook-
ing the gardens dim -light from the
palace windows streaked in bars
across it but he saw no sign of evanie
but could that be evanie-there
where the bushes shadowed the pool

chapter xxiii
the amphimorphs in the pool

tom connor made his way hur-
riedly to the gardens he saw
evanie crouched in the shadow of
shrubbery just above the brink of the
water he dashed forward as she
glanced up at him

 evanie he began oh my
dear-

  hush her voice was tense

 but-

  be still speak softly do you
think i want a scanner on me she
paused id rather youd go away
she whispered

  he seated himself stubbornly beside
her though it seemed certain she was
waiting for someone jan orm prob-
ably

  i wont go he said in subdued
voice youve got to listen to me
evanie

  please  she murmured be quiet
tom ive been waiting here six
hours

  for what

  she made no reply he subsided
into gloomy silence watching the
great column of water that gushed
from the jaws of the huge stone lion
at the far end of the pool the water
smooth as a steel pillar fell with sur-
prisingly little sound

  but while he gazed it changed the

smoothness was broken bubbles
flashed and then the flow ceased alto-
gether while a huge bubble glistened
billowed and broke something white
and shining and large as a man shot
with a small splash into the pool the
column of water crashed instantly
back

 a webbed hand holding a silk-
wrapped package rose suddenly from
the black water an amphimorph

  evanie seized the bundle crammed
it beneath an urban cape at her side

  quick she said tensely stand
here beside me tom so well block
the scanner

 he obeyed wonderingly a queer
low coo came from evanies lips the
black waters parted again and he
glimpsed the tiny round mouth and
horrible face of the creature in the
pool it flopped to the bank scuttled
desperately along into the bushes he
saw it raise the lid of a manhole or a
storm-sewer and it was gone

 pale and trembling evanie sank
down on the bank her bronzed legs
dangling toward the water

  if only we werent seen she whis-
pered

  how the devil did that thing get
here connor demanded

  it rode a bubble down the water
tunnel from the mountains fifty miles
an amphimorph doesnt need much
air a big bubble will last

 but-

 dont ask me how it found the
maze of mains in urbs i dont know
i only know they have queer instinc-
tive ways of getting where they want
to go now its gone into the storm-
sewer it will find its way to the
canal and so up rivers to its moun-
tains

  but what was that it brought and
from whom

 from king orm

  from whom he persisted

  tom she said quietly im not
going to tell you

  what was in that package eva-
nie

  i wont tell you that either she
threw the cape over her arm conceal-
ing the package i cant trust you
tom you and i are enemies
startling stories

he backed away at his anger
tom please you promised
to help me escape didnt you

 all right he yielded dully
evanie i sought you out here be-
cause i wanted to end this misunder-
standing please give me a chance to
convince you i love you

  he held out his arms to her she
backed another step

 i wont come near you tom i
wont trust myself in your arms im
afraid of you and im afraid of my-
self youre strong-too strong for
me physically and perhaps too strong
otherwise you wakened my love
once i dare not chance it again
oh evanie now of all times
when i need you

 need me a queer expression
flickered over her face so the black
flame burns at last he voice
dropped to a murmur im sorry for
you tom im sorry for anyone who
loves her because shes utterly heart-
less but i cant come near you i
dont dare

  she turned and darted suddenly into
the palace leaving him to stare hope-
lessly after and then to follow slowly

  he slept little that night restless
tortured hours were filled with dreams
of margaret of urbs and the sound of
her laughter he arose early and
wandered dully from his room

  the halls were crowded with arriv-
ing immortals among whom he
stalked as silent and grave as them-
selves at last tired of aimless wan-
dering he went into the shaded gar-
dens and sat glumly down beside the
pool

 far overhead triangle drifted
with muffled throbbing roars and a
bird sang in the bushes deep in his
own perturbed thoughts he was star-
tled when he heard his name spoken
softly almost timidly

 tom

 he looked up margaret of urbs
stood beside him garbed in the most
magnificent gown he had ever seen
golden and black and concealing her
tiny feet instead of the circlet of the
previous evening she wore now a cor-
onet of scintillant brilliance and the
strange flower flamed at her waist

 official robes she said and smiled
 i preside this morning

 she looked a little worn he thought
 there was a pallor on her cheeks and
 a subdued air about her her smile
 almost wistful tore at him

you didnt give me a chance to
thank you for last night he said

did you want to thank me for-
everything

no he said stonily not for
everything

 she dropped listlessly to the bench
 beside him

 im tired she said wearily i
 didnt sleep well and my head aches
 that grecian wine i must see mar-
 tin sair

 my head aches for other reasons
 he said grimly

 im sorry tom

were you laughing at me last
night he blazed

 no she said gently no

 i dont believe you

no matter tom i came here to
tell you something she paused and
gazed steadily at him the master
will grant you immortality

what

she nodded he considers you
worthy

worthy what of the children of
mine he was so anxious about
youre to have them first

 he laughed bitterly then ill be
 old and feeble by the time im ready
 for immortality evanie has refused
 me-and i refuse him ill live my
 life out in my own way

 think well of it first she said
 slowly and something in her voice
 caught him

now i know i wont accept he
flashed you begged him for it do
you think id take favors of you

 i didnt- she was silent after a
 moment she said would you believe
 one statement of mine tom

 not one

 at last his bitterness touched her
 she flushed faintly the old gleam of
 mockery shone for an instant

youre right of course she
snapped theres nothing real re-
maining of margaret of urbs shes
the black flame

st

the black flame that burns on illu-
sions altar you must never believe
a single word of hers

  nor do i

  but will you believe one sentence
if i swear it by something sacred to
me one thing tom

  whats sacred to you god hon-
or not even yourself

  by the one thing i love she said
steadily i swear im speaking the
truth now will you believe me

  it was on his very tongue to say
no he was thoroughly surprised to
hear himself mutter yes-and mean
it

  then do you remember that day in
the triangle when i said i was going
to commit suicide i swear that is
the only lie ive ever told you do
you understand the only lie

  she arose as he stared at her un-
comprehendingly

  i want to be alone she whispered
im going to - a brief wistful
smile- my thinking room

connors brain was whirling
he did believe her what of it
evanie didnt love him he knew that
now and he didnt love evanie and
margaret of urbs-said she loved him
could it be possible   

  a blinding light in his brain the
black flame-his the unearthly
beauty of her the wild untamed char-
acter his to tame-if he could the
santanic spirit the fiery soul all his
for life for life for immortality
if he chose

  an exultant shout burst from him
and went echoing between the walls
as he leaped to the palace door flung
himself through

 memory of evanie had vanished
like mist where was the princess
in her thinking room then he re-
membered the laboratory behind the
throne room

a speaker blared down the hall
as he ran conclave in thirty
minutes

  the corridors were thronged he
jostled his way past crowds of guards
servants officials and austere immor-
tals curious eyes followed him but

no one moved to halt him

  not at least until he reached the
great arch of the throne room itself
the crystal doors were shut and a line
of four impassive guards blocked the
way he moved to step between them
and a sharp challenge sounded

  he paused i want to see the prin-
cess he said firmly

  none to pass snapped the guard
masters orders

  but is the princess in there

  her highness responded the
guard entered here five minute ago
she said nothing of any one to fol-
low

      chapter xxiv
      the atomic bomb

reluctantly tom connor

fell back this was the only way
to her laboratory of that he was cer-
tain he leaned against the wall and
clenched his fists in a frenzy of im-
patience

  the glass doors opened and the
master emerged accompanied by mar-
tin sair and two other tall immortals

  sir connor begged eagerly tell
this fellow to pass me i want to see
the princess

  a curious quizzical expression
flickered in the eyes of the great ruler
he shook his head

  im sorry thomas he said mildly
in fifteen minutes the princess will
be needed you can wait

  but-i think she wants to see me
then she can wait as well his
eyes flickered again she has waited
not too patiently for more than seven
centuries he moved away down the
corridor leaving connor nonplussed

  he curbed his impatience after all
the master was right time stretched
before him and margaret of urbs-
years upon years of it but it was
hard to lose these precious moments

  he thought of the vision screens
just behind him was the vast office op-
posite the throne room he turned
in there bursting in upon a scene of
feverish activity as the records of half
the world were made ready for the im-


startling stories

mortals of the southern hemisphere
glancing about he descried a screen
on a table at the far end of the room
and twisted his way down the lfne of

desks ignoring a thousand staring
clerks

  the princess he said eagerly
snapping the switch in her labora-
tory behind the throne room

  on the screen flashed a girls face
but not that of margaret of urbs

  im sorry she said no calls to
any at the conclave masters or-
ders the screen clicked blank again
as he growled an angry epithet

  in the hallway he saw evanie star-
ing with strange intentness at the
closed glass doors he pushed his
way to her side

  hello he said and was puzzled by
her sudden look of fear but she re-
covered herself and glanced coolly at
him

  oh its you she said briefly

  he thought wonderingly how dif-
ferent was this evanie from the timid
modest little ormon girl of so few
days ago but he hardly cared the
flame had burned him free of evanie

  waiting for the parade of the im-
mortals he asked with a quiet smile

  perhaps

  i thought you hated them so that
youd prefer not even looking at
them

  her voice changed to bitterness i
do

  well whats the answer then

  she glanced at a watch on her wrist

  youll know in a moment or two
she gave him a curiously sardonic
smile im not afraid to tell you now
ill even tell you what was in the pack-
age i took from the amphimorph
would you like to know

  of course

  her voice quivered excitedly in
that package was an atomic bomb

  an atomic bomb

  yes and do you know where it is
now the voice rose exultant fan-
atically elated at the wall behind
the throne of urbs behind the
throne where the masters sitting this
moment she laughed at his horri-
fied face my thanks for sponsoring
my request for freedom tom it

helped

  the master isnt in there he said
tightly i saw him leave

  he saw her face whiten-and then

an appalling thought struck him

 oh god but the princess is

the princess is

ue dashed toward the guarded
door disregarding evanies cry
of warning tom its due its
due

  he rushed at the impassive guards
but before their challenge was uttered
a thunderous roar reverberated in the
vast hall like the rumbling thunder of
a collapsing mountain

  a continuous screaming bellow like
the clamor in hell rose in an ear-blast-
ing crescendo and beyond the glass
doors rolled billowing clouds of
steam shot through with jagged fires

 maddened to desperation tom
connor plunged against the doors
they swung inward and closed behind
him and he was in the room of the
blast far down behind the masters
throne an erupting geyser of destruc-
tion appalled him-a mighty roaring
billowing cloud of smoke-streaked
steam that shrieked louder than the
tortured souls of the seventh circle of
hell

  crashing discharges of stray energy
etched flames through the cloud like
lightning behind a thunder-head and
the reverberations echoed above the
roar of the disrupting hydrogen the
masters throne was hidden by the
bellowing fires that grounded to it

  but even that holcaust had not yet
filled the vast concave of the throne
room the end where connor stood
momentarily bewildered was as yet
clouded only by shreds and streamers
he lowered his head and charged into
the inferno margaret was caught
somewhere behind that hellish blast

  scalding steam licked at him swirl-
ing about his body his bare legs and
shoulders stung at the touch his face
burned but he gained the line of
thrones and paused a single moment
on the shielded side what an en-
gine of destruction a bomb that in-
stead of venting its force in a single
blast kept on exploding as succesive
the black flame



billions of atoms shattered

  no need to look for the door the
detonation the first blast had blown
the wall open instantly he made a
dash over the scorching debris where
the mighty girders were fantastically
twisted and bent away from the roar-
ing center pointed up in the misty
light he launched himself at the
edge of the opening passing close to
the very threshold of that trap-door
of tophet

  gamma radiations excoriated his
body the shriek of dying atoms
thundered against his tortured ear-
drums and he was burning-blister-
ing but an implacable thrust urged
him on he was responsible for this
chaos this holocaust and margaret
of urbs-he had violated his oath to
the master evanie had betrayed him
into that she had tricked him into
sponsoring her plea for freedom and
because he had aided her this had hap-
pened jan orm could have done no
damage alone only evanie because
of the inhuman blood in her could
have dealt with an amphimorph
evanie with whom he had thought
himself in love

  and the princess whom he did love
was somewhere beyond he raged on
his mind turbulent as the blast itself
into martin sairs laboratory a flam-
ing outer region of hell clouded to in-
visibility suffocating scorching he
crashed against its farther wall slid
along it at last found the door

the luxurious room of the prin-
cess was in chaotic disorder but
only lazy wisps of steam drifted there
and the bellow of the blast was muf-
fled but even now the wall was crack-
ing

  margaret he cried margaret
of urbs

  her voice answered him she was
in a corner crouching injured no
she was searching earnestly through
a pile of debris that had been swept
across the room by the first concus-
sion he rushed toward her

  come on he shouted well
break a window and get out

  she glanced coolly up

 a window try it a bullet

might but nothing less

  he snatched up a chair spun it
fiercely against the pane the chair
shattered two tiny dents showed in
the crystal and that was all and in
the palace ventilated by washed air
from the topmost pinnacles of the
twin towers no windows opened
he whirled on her

 then it will have to be back
through the blast he roared come
on

  she stood up facing him she had
slipped off the gold-black robe in the
steaming heat wore now the typical
revealing garb of urbs save that the
material was of black velvet instead of
metallic scales

  you cant go through in clothes
like that he shouted

 my venus she said it was
blown somewhere here i want it
youll come now

  i want my ivory venus

  the pale flash of ivory caught his
eye

  here it is then he snapped
thrusting the statuette into his belt
now come

  faint mockery flashed in her eyes
  what if i dont

  he shook a rugged fist you will
or ill take you

  she was motionless

 why she asked do you risk
your life to reach me

  because he snarled in exaspera-
tion i was unwittingly responsible
for this i was tricked into breaking
my word do you think i can let the
master-or you-suffer for my stupid-
ity

  oh she said her eyes dropping
well-i wont go

  by god you will he sprang to
seize her but she evaded him

  but only for a moment as again he
saw the gleam of mockery in her eyes

  very well she said suddenly sub-
missive

  he snatched the flowing robe from
the floor as she turned and walked
steadily toward the wall that now
heaved and cracked and groaned be-
fore he could reach her she had flung
open the door-and hell roared in
upon them


startling stories

  martin sairs laboratory was a mass
of smoke and steam like the crater of
erebus that flames in the eternal ice
of antarctica flinging the robe over

the princess like an enshrouding
blanket connor propelled her muffled
and stumbling toward the evil efful-
gence of the screaming blast

  at the break in the wall he put his
weight into a mighty thrust that sent
her sliding staggering sprawling into
the room where the fiery cloud closed
billowing about her then he leaped
through his flesh writhing in the tor-
ment of the stinging rays and blister-
ing at the touch of scalding steam

margaret of urbs was clam-
bering to her feet stumbling
in the entangling robe in the all but
unbearable shelter of the thrones she
choked as the searing air reached her
lungs

  you hurt she cried

  come on

  again the taunting gleam even with
blistering death staring them in the
face but she followed unresisting as
he seized her arm and plunged
through the blinding fog of steam and
smoke that now filled the mighty room
to the distant ceiling blind chance
was their guide as they rushed ahead
staggering coughing teary-eyed it
seemed a long way were they cir-
cling in the gloom of the monstrous
chamber

  the princess dragged against con-
nors arm

  no she gasped this way-this
way

  he let her lead they struggled
through billowing masses that began
to take fantastic shapes-charging
monsters heaving mountains she
staggered stumbled but shook off the
arm he raised to support her

  ive never needed help she mut-
tered proudly i never will

  it seemed to him that the blast
roared closer

  are we-right he choked

  then through a momentary rift he
saw something that sickened him-the
row of thrones smoking and black-
ened in the blaze they had circled

  through some vagary of draught or

  ventilation there was a little area of
almost clear air beside the throne of
the princess coughing and choking
they faced each other in it he was

astounded to see a flickering taunt-
ing smile play for a single instant on
her lips her hair singed and plas-
tered flat by the steamy condensation
her face soot-streaked and reddened
she was yet so incredibly lovely that
he forgot even their peril as her smile
turned suddenly earnest wistful

  dearest she whispered inaudi-
bly but he read her lips ill con-
fess now we were safe in my room
we must have been watched in the vi-
sion screens and men would have
come to cut through the window

  he was appalled

 then why-

  listen to me tom even here i
misled you for i knew which way the
door lies by the pattern on the floor
but if you will not love me i must
kill you as i promised then let both of
us die for i cannot watch you age
year by year-and then perish i can-
not

  flame he roared his voice impas-
sioned but i love you did you
think- i love you flame

  her streaming eyes widened

  oh god she choked now its
too late she covered her face then
abruptly glanced up again with a
dawning hope in her eyes perhaps
not she cried can they see us
here no-the steam but men will
come in moon-suits to carry away the
blast-if-we can live-until then
she coughed but we cant she was
swaying you go-that way kiss
me tom and leave me i want to die
-on the throne-of urbs only-a
thing-like this some accident-can
kill an-immortal

  leave you he cried not even
in death he choked as he drew her
close

  a wave of steam and fire engulfed
them help me to my-throne she
whispered gasping

  her eyes tear-bright and sea-green
in the fierce lightnings went blank
they closed and she slipped half
through his arms her knees gave
way as she collapsed
the black flame

inferno

he held her against him put her
on the throne why not why
not hold her there until the end die
with her in his arms or perhaps
shield her with his body until men
came or until the blast burned out
somehow she must be saved

 never-not even when a thousand
years ago an electric current was shot
through him to kill him had his urge
for life been so great as it was now
now when life promised so much-
the love of himself and the black
flame of urbs two beings who should
have been dead centuries ago and in
different ages-he must die

 had destiny kept them alive to
meet and love for this brief moment
before death madness better to
die struggling for life raising the
girl in his arms he staggered away
toward the wall that still shielded the
room where he had found the prin-
cess

  her weight was slight but he had
not taken ten steps when he went
crashing to his knees he struggled
up dizzily the line of diagonal black
squares showed dim on the floor yet
he could not be sure that he had not
changed his direction he was suf-
focating  the roaring blast seemed to
bellow in a gigantic throbbing now in
his very ears now dim and faint and
far away

  he battled on suddenly he real-
ized that he was moving burdenless
without even being aware of it he
had dropped the princess he turned
grimly back until he stumbled over
her lying huddled with her cheek
against the steaming floor swinging
her across his shoulder gripping her
knees so tightly that his fingers bit
into the silk-soft skin he staggered
back over the lost ground

  each step was a gamble with death
if he fell now he would never rise
again he tottered on while his lungs
labored in the vitiated air and the
searing steam then behind him the

blast roared fainter or was it simply
that his senses were dulling

  it was the sharp blow of his head
against the wall that brought him back
from a dreamy somnolence into which
he was falling surprised to feel the
weight of the unconscious girl still
on his shoulder

  the wall which wall in what
direction was the door that meant
life he groaned and turned at ran-
dom to the right simply because his
right arm clutched the limbs of mar-
garet of urb and his left hand was
free to support him against the carved
masonry but an ejaculation of tri-
umph escaped his burned cracked
lips as his hand slid over steam-
clouded glass and he saw white faces
through the track k left

  he could go no further make not
one more move the limp body of
the princess slid from his arms and
vaguely then he knew that both of
them were being dragged into the
safety of the corridor he gasped in
great breaths of clear air that whis-
tled in his seared throat and then his
heart chilled as his bloodshot eyes
turned on the form of the flame

her face frightened him waxen
pale still as the image on her
throne she seemed scarcely to
breathe a grave immortal who bent
above her straightened up and said
tensely

  get martin sair-and quickly
his eyes flashed to connor youre
not hurt he said just rest here for
some time

  there was a stir in the hallway
two men in brown all-encompassing
suits and crystal helmets were pull-
ing something metal it looked like
a steam-shovel scoop with two fifty-
foot handles a grapple for the blast
to box it before it undermined the
vast palace

  then martin sair was at hand and
the master his sorrowful eyes on the
princess

  clear the corridor said the sandy-
haired immortal and guards swept
back the crowd

  through the north arch connor
glimpsed thousands upon thousands


startling stories

of urbans on the palace lawn and
then they were hidden as the gates
closed

  he must go too said martin sair
nodding at connor the fewer lungs
here the better the girl is asphyx-
iated

  no connor croaked flinging an
arm across the flame

  all right move aside then

  but a roaring like all the tortured
souls since creation burst from the
opening doors out rushed the
gnomelike men pulling their grapple
and connor thrust his body between
them and the princess taking the
fierce rays on his own flesh

  the container glowed brilliant as
the sun and out beyond the north
arch a chain dropped from the sky-
a triangle to bear away the deadly
thing to drop it into the sea and the
palace was silent now as the silence
of death

  death tom connor glanced fear-
fully at the marble features of mar-
garet of urbs they were like death
too and he gazed so fascinated that he
was utterly surprised to look up and
see evanie and jan orm being
herded down the corridor by half a
dozen grim-faced guards

  trying to escape out of the south
gate said one

  the master turned cold burning
eyes on them and then again looked
sorrowfully down on the still perfec-
tion of the features of the black
flame

  an immortal placed a box at martin
sairs side

  adrenalin snapped the giver of
life and took the tube the other
handed him amino-hyoscine da-
turamine

  he pressed the pale flesh of the
girls arm parted the closed lids to
gaze into unseeing eyes finally in
the familiar manner of an ancient
physician he placed thumb and fore-
finger on her wrist frowning as he
felt for the faint throb of her pulse

  suffocated he repeated as-
phyxia

  in an agony of apprehension his
eyes blurred connor watched the slow
rise and fall of her breast twice he

fancied that the movement had ceased
and each time with an almost inaudi-
ble gasp the labored breathing re-
commenced then it did cease he
was positive and a great wave of de-
spair engulfed him

  her hearts stopping martin sair
said briefly

 dying tom connor gazed wildly
about the corridor uncomprehend-
ing he saw the grim light of triumph
in the face of evanie sair as she
looked coldly down on the fading
glory of the black flame

  that such beauty should perish-
be thrust into the earth-turn into a
heap of crumbling bones unthink-
able

 dying connor croaked dy-
ing

  martin sair said only now car-
diacine and get the oxygen mask
ready

  dying he croaked again

  the giver of life glanced coldly at
him

  dying he echoed impassively
no dead what of it

  the master turned grimly away and
passed silently into the throne room
with a word of brief command to the
guards they thrust evanie sair and
jan orm before them but tom con-
nor did not miss the backward glance
of triumph which the girl flung
defiantly at him

connor gazed desolately on the
lovely clay that had been the
black flame of urbs wondering dully
why martin sair still bent so atten-
tively above her still kept the pale
wrist in his hand

  he started when the austere immor-
tal moved placed his lips close to the
cold ones of the girl and rapped out

 now the mask

  the giver of life jammed a cone
over the still face there was a mo-
ments silence nothing happened
the scientist bent closer abruptly
he placed his hands about the waist of
the princess shook her violently un-
til her head rolled from side to side
he slapped her breast her cheeks
and then like the faint sighing of
evening wind she breathed
the black flame



  a thin muffled gasp-no more but
life-bearing oxygen flowed into her
lungs and the suspended metabolism
of her body resumed its interrupted
chemistries her breathing strength-
ened to a labored whistling panting

 chain-stokes breathing mut-
tered martin sair whose genius had
recalled a spirit already treading the
pathways of eternity the black
flame rekindled burned dimly and
flickeringly-but burned

  it was past connor to comprehend
the transition from the deeps of deso-
lation to the peak of hope was too vast
to span in a moment he merely
gazed blankly on the mask-covered
face of the princess when realiza-
tion began to dawn the cry of amaze-
ment and ecstasy strangled in his
seared throat and became only an in-
choate gurgle he managed a choked
question

  will she-live he moved as if
to clasp her in his arms

  dont snapped martin sair on
your life dont touch her yet give
her red corpuscles time to oxygenate
the girls asphyxiated suffocated
strangled do you want it all to do
over again his eyes perceived the
anguish in connors face and he soft-
ened of course shell live did you
think death could so easily defeat
martin sair he has beaten me many
a time but never in so mild a contest
as this

  the great immortal again bent over
the girl her breathing had eased
for a terrible instant connor thought
it was ceasing once more martin
sair lifted the mask from the pallid
perfect features still quiet as mar-
ble save for the sighing of her breath-
ing

  now the elixir vitae he said
that will put fire into this chilly
blood

  he took a phial of ruby liquid from
the hand of his silent assistant the
same potent stimulant it appeared
that had roused evanie from the
deathlike sleep of the messenger

  the princess was far too deep in
unconsciousness to swallow martin
sair poured a tiny trickling stream
between her lips no more than a few

crimson drops it was enough as it
made its fiery way down her throat she
moaned and her exquisite face twisted
as if in agony the limp hands
clenched convulsively into white fists

artin sair rose

  you see he said to his
grave assistant there was nothing or-
ganically wrong oxygen-starved
that was all the organism was un-
damaged the blood had not even
begun to coagulate it was simply
necessary to start the body machine
working since it was in perfect run-
ning order

  cardiacine is a gamble his assist-
ant said slowly ive had it rupture
the hearts in some cases

 martin sair snorted not with
proper precautions daturamine and

chapter xxvi
the master sits in judgment

in the throne room the ventila-
tors had drawn out the steam and
smoke-poisoned air but moisture
dripped from the walls and gathered
in pools on the floor the terrific de-
struction of the blast was evident
everywhere no single hanging re-
mained on walls or windows every-
thing inflammable was in cinders and
the very floor was still almost blister-
ing hot

  the far end was a mass of inde-
scribable ruin debris from the shat-
tered wall even fragments of the di-
orite bases of the thrones the air
despite the humming ventilators was
stifling in the radiations from floor
and walls

  the master sat upon the half-melted
wreckage of his throne his stern eyes
on evanie and jan orm who stood be-
tween guards before him

  the frightened look on evanies
face moved connor despite the inju-
ries she had done him after all she
had nursed him out of the very grave
and given him penniless and strange
a home and a place in this bizarre
world she was clinging frantically
to the arm of jan who stood morose
and impassive before the master

homas the ruler said i can
get nothing from this sullen pair
tell me what you know of this

  connor met evanies terrified gaze
and it wrung pity from him he owed
much to this girl was it any more
than right that he help her now at
least he could confuse the issue pro-
long it until he could obtain the aid of
margaret of urbs

  i did it myself he said promptly

  there was no change in the masters
face

  you he repeated mildly how

  i made the bomb in martin sairs
laboratory connor said with a quick
warning glance at evanie i made it
at night and smuggled it in here dur-
ing the darkness thats all

  indeed after your oath thomas
and i had flattered myself that you
were my friend-my esteemed friend
there was something inscrutable in
the masters face the grave eyes sur-
veyed connor sorrowfully as he fin-
gered a beam-pistol

  i think said the master slipping
out the weapon that i will destroy
you once and for all connor he
leveled the gun

 wait shrieked jan orm he
didnt do it-i did he paused as
the masters cool eyes shifted to him
i had it made in ormon and smug-
gled here to me i hid it in the throne
room early this morning before any
one was about

  well said the master slowly i
might believe that both of you had a
hand in it

  his eyes flickered over evanie

  she drew herself erect

  whats the use she said dully
i wont have you two shielding me
i did it i had the bomb smuggled
to me by an amphimorph who rode a
bubble down the mains to the pool in
the gardens thats the truth

  suppose then said the master
i destroy all three of you and thus
assure myself that the guilty one is
punished

  i dont care evanie flung out de-
fiantly im sorry i failed but at
least ive extinguished the black
flame of urbs-and im glad

the rulers eyes held a curious
light as he gazed over their heads
a step sounded behind them con-
nor whirled to see margaret of urbs
approaching supported by the arm of
martin sair soot-stained the whole
slim length of her right leg red and
blistered by the blast her right cheek
inflamed by the contact with the
steaming floor she was yet so incredi-
bly lovely that she was breath-taking
tom connor sprang to her side
slipped a steadying arm about her as
she swayed willingly against him
evanie so pale she seemed about to
faint was leaning weakly against jan
orm

  whats all this joaquin asked
the princess
the black flame

  merely an attempt to fix responsi-
bility for the bombing my dear
and have you fixed it

  all three claim the honor

 i see she paused well i
can throw some light on the mystery
i am responsible for the bomb explo-
sion it was an accident i was
watching some detonol crystallize in
martin sairs room and forgot to take
it off the burner i was stunned by
the concussion and thomas connor
rushed in and guided me out some-
where in the throne room i suppose
i must have been overcome

  she paused again staring back at
the master

  dont you see each of these three
suspects the others and each is trying
to shield his friends but i did it it
was an accident

  she slipped from connors arm and
sank wearily to the steps that led to
her ruined throne

  i burn she muttered and sipped
the goblet of water that a guard held
to her lips

  quizzically the master gazed down
at her

 you know he said suddenly
stern that to me the one unforgiv-
able sin is the thwarting of my plans
not even you my sister may stand in
the way of them while i live i am
the master i shall yield only when
a power arises strong enough to over-
throw me for that will tell me that my
work is done when that occurs i
shall have guided humanity as far as
i am able along the path of destiny
but until then-i am the master

  his face austere as an image in ba-
salt loomed over them for the first
time connor glimpsed dimly the co-
lossus behind the mild mask the dia-
mond hardness below the silk that
sheathed it then the ruler smiled

  i suppose i cannot doubt my sis-
ters word i release all of you
he arose and descended from the
throne

  connor followed a step or two im
interested to learn he whispered
which of us you believe

  the master smiled again havent

i just said he turned away of
course if i were curious i could ask

you and jan orm how you knew what
time to set the blast i hadnt decided
on a time for the conclave until i had
it announced in the corridors and the
bomb must have been placed between
that moment and the arrival of the
guards

  or the princess is telling the
truth suggested tom connor

  some day margaret shall explain
why detonol causes a cloud of steam
observed the master he continued
absently evanie has good blood in
her so has jan orm then he was
gone followed by martin sair and the
guards

connor returned to margaret of
urbs evanies incredulous eyes
were fixed on the princess as she
whispered

  why did you do that

  because i thought it would please
tom connor margaret of urbs said
frankly

  evanie stared at her with dawning
comprehension

  the black flame herself burned
she murmured wonderingly i see
now why we can still learn from the
ancients theyre miracle workers
but the next instant her brown eyes
glittered vindictively im glad at
least that the conquest of the flame
was during my lifetime she bowed
half in wonderment half in mockery
before connor i salute the prince-
consort of urbs

  the princess flushed faintly and
connor laughed and glanced away
something that sparkled in a pile of
ashes caught his eye he stooped to
retrieve the marvelous crystalline
flower glowing brilliant and inde-
structible untouched - even bright-
ened-by the blast

  what is this he asked

  my moon-orchid said margaret
of urbs the only perfect one ever
found

  he grinned and turned to evanie

 i promised you one here-our
wedding present to you and jan

  engagement present rather said

the princess i owe you two some-
what more than you realize she
ignored both evanies silence and jan


startling stories

orms protestations of mingled em-
barrassment thanks and refusal as he
held the priceless thing tom she
murmured would you mind if we
were-alone

  it was dismissal jan and evanie
backed away with half awe-struck
glances at connor he dropped be-
side the weary princess of urbs slip-
ping his arm tenderly about her
scorched shoulders even in the sul-
triness of that blasted chamber she
shivered her teeth chattered so re-
cently had the icy face of death with-
drawn

  he drew her close then halted as
he heard a distant thin clamor be-
yond the windows

  whats that he asked sharply
another revolution

 just the newspapers i guess
youve been in them frequently of
late she smiled wanly as often
as i this past week the weed who
sustained the ionic beams-revealed as
a living ancient-proclaimed for im-
mortality-the rescuer of margaret of
urbs-and now- she quoted iron-
ically margaret to wed romance
rumored with rescuer  she nestled
closer to him oh the downfall of
the black flame will be well publi-
cized never fear let them add this
to their pictures and vision broadcasts
i dont care

 pictures what pictures he
glanced about the vast deserted cham-
ber

  from the seeing room of course
dont you suppose we were watched
all during the blast even in here as
much as the steam permitted dont
you know were being watched now
photographed for papers and broad-
casts youre world news tom
she frowned they must have
thought me mad to rush into that in-
ferno with you out of safety well
-i was mad

 you cant even die in privacy
here connor said bluntly do you
suppose-his voice dropped to a
whisper-they heard what you-what
we said

  above the roar of the blast no
i thought of that when i-said it

he miled at that it was so typi-
cal of the utterly strange and
fascinating character of the girl he
drew her against him and felt the
pressure of something hard in his belt
-the ivory venus still safe still im-
maculate in its perfection since it had
been on the left side shielded by his
own flesh when he passed the blast

  i know what i shall give you as a
wedding present he said slowly
the original venus de milo the
most beautiful statue of the ancient
world

  she smiled and a trace of the old
mockery showed and i know what
i shall give you she said life
immortality

 not immortality life she
turned her emerald eyes on him
tom is it very hard to give up the
idea of children men want children
dont they

  most of us do-but its a happiness
well lost for you he glanced down
at her listen cant this immortality
thing be undone wouldnt it be pos-
sible for martin sair to render you
mortal for-a few years

  of course further exposure to
the hard rays will do it

  and then eagerly could we-
the smile she flashed at him had in
it a touch of heaven yes she said
exultant but instantly a cloud chased
away the smile but dont you re-
member what sort of children women
bear whove been too long in the ray
she whispered amphimorphs tom
would you like to be father to a little
amphimorph

  he shuddered thank you well
do as we are then

  she burst suddenly into laughter al-
most as mocking as her old self then
she was as suddenly serious tender

 tom she murmured i wont
tease you that will be my gift to
you martin sair can do what you
wish there is some leeway to the
process-enough perhaps for a sin-
gle time ill give you five years of
mortality my permanent age is
twenty now it will be twenty-five
then but who in all the world could
have anticipated that the black flame
would assume motherhood-and like
the black flame



it tom thats my gift to you-life
kiss me

for a moment of ecstasy he felt her
lips quiver against his

two boys and a girl she mur-
mured wont we tom

and can martin sair he asked
ironically fix that for us too

of course two boys like you
tom she was suddenly dreamy-
eyed

 but not a girl like you

why not

the eternal

herbert zulerich was a

big heavy-framed man with a
tangled mop of shaggy hair
which lay back from his sloping fore-
head and clustered about the collar of
his dark coat his nose was big and
prominent jutting like a huge peak
upon his face and his mouth was a
deep-lined canyon between that peak
and the bulge of his chin

  zulerichs habits were as strange as

stream of autos seemed to disturb him
but little

  in truth they disturbed him a great
deal some days he would watch them
in their hurry as they drove furiously
along the straight line of paved road-
way and into his face would come
gloom and melancholy into his large
blue eyes would come a hurt look and
an odd feeling of sympathy for those
who seemed so full of life so gay so

some stories are forgotten almost as soon as printed others
stand the test of time

because the eternal man by d d sharp has stood this
test we are nominating it for scientifictions hall of fame

  in each issue we will nominate-and reprint-another favorite
of the past this department has been inaugurated in response to
scores of requests from science fiction readers

  in writing to startling stories please vote for your favor-
ites we will adopt as many of your suggestions as possible we
are endeavoring to bring you the very best that has been written
in this field and to make realities of your memories

  by thus bringing a new permanence to the science fiction gems
of yesterday we hope to perform a real service to the science
fiction devotees of today and tomorrow

his face and ponderous as his big
body how he lived no one knew and
no one knew either how he managed
to maintain his formidable array of
test tubes and retorts in his labor-
atory was every conceivable kind of
peculiar glass holding liquids of all
colors

  zulerich had been at one time a
chemist of somewhat more than local
fame but of late years he had become
a recluse staying alone most of the
time in his big stone house just back
of the highway where the constant

thoughtless would creep into his
heart

  death death the old man would
whisper man goes through long
years of preparation for the few days
of accomplishment before the con-
queror destroys all

  so much preparation he would
whisper as he shook his big head so
many brilliant minds polished and
blazing for an hour like roses grown
and tended to be cut for an evenings
bloom  hands so skillfully trained and
so soon folded quietly at rest

man by d d sharp

  that the old man was in quest of
some great secret everyone who knew
him had long ago suspected but what
that secret was no one knew and few
could hazard even a guess

  the truth was zulerichs mind was
obsessed by a single thought-the ap-

palling waste of death and since sci-
ence and invention were conquering
the other enemies of mans existence
zulerich had set out after the exam-
ple of ponce de leon to discover the
elements which might be combined to
give man eternal life

still old zulerich sat a corpse but uttburied motionless but alive




startling stories

  a fantastic quest seemingly hope-
less yet zulerich felt that he was mak-
ing progress he had discovered
things which had astonished even him
some of his experiments had awed and
stupefied him and then he made a dis-
covery which gave him a decided
fright

he had been experimenting with
unicellular organisms and had
found that they did not behave as in-
organic chemicals did he knew that
the reaction of those animalcules was
distinctly physiological and not
merely physical organic and not
purely chemical they did not resem-
ble any known chemicals for they re-
acted as individuals and not as mere
materials this discovery he found
was confirmed by jennings in his book
behavior of unicellular organisms

  old zulerich had studied the intri-
cate processes of cellular division and
multiplication hoping to penetrate
the law of the organism and discover
what it was that at the peak of
growth prevented further cleavage of
cells in short he wanted to find the
principle which confined the limits of
size and growth find what it was
that caused the cells of a living body
to increase and multiply until matu-
rity and then cease growing except
when incited by a cut or other acci-
dent to the tissue why should a cell
become active to replace wounded
flesh yet balk at rebuilding vital tis-
sues such as the lungs or refuse to
replace a lost tooth more than once

  he experimented in numerous ways
to provoke cell growth trying to di-
vine whether they had individualities
of their own or whether they were
bounded by the individuality of the
whole he wanted to find whether
ells had an intelligence which caused
them to do the remarkable things nec-
essary to their coordination in the
body

  zulerich found out many things
mystifying things which no amount of
scientific theory could possibly ex-
plain he perfected chemicals which
applied to a rabbits head caused its
hair to grow so long as to make it nec-
essary for him to gather it into a bag

and even then the weight of it grew
so great that the rabbit could no
longer drag its load and he killed the
animal out of mercy but still its
hair grew and grew

 his high-walled back-yard soon
held some monstrous freaks produced
by his chemicals dogs with heads as
big as water barrels and bodies of nor-
mal size rats with bodies as big as
cows and heads no bigger than pea-
nuts and one day he applied a chem-
ical to a horses eyes and the eyes
grew out of their sockets like long
ropes of white sinew with great knobs
of gelatin-like iris-limp flabby canes
that dragged upon the ground the
effect of this last experiment so cut
the kind soul of zulerich that he killed
all the monstrosities and recoiled
from the thought of making more
then he looked again from his win-
dow over the wide world where death
laid waste sighed tightened his lips
and plunged into his work again

  it was not growth that zulerich
wanted he was quite content that
man should retain his present stature
what he desired was to increase mans
years

  and then he discovered it he did
not need to wait and watch until the
end of time to determine whether or
not cells would eventually die he
knew that they would not die a few
drops of the pale green fluid in the
graduating glass he held in his hand
would permit any man to live eter-
nally for he had at last found the
combination he sought the chemical
which continued life without the ne-
cessity of decay

after a year of experiment upon
his cells he tried a drop upon a
rat lie caught the rat in one hand
and held his medicine dropper with
its pale green fluid in the other but
as the dropper released its globule
the rat moved its head and the drop
hit the side of its face trickled down
and spread about its throat it left a
scar upon the hair a peculiar scar like
a question mark zulerich tried again
with a second drop with better suc-
cess the rat swallowed it

  zulerich watched carefully the
the eternal man



animals heart seemed to cease beating
the lungs became motionless and
yet the rat lived with the fire of life
in its pink eyes it lived on day after
day week after week month after
month without the slightest loss of
weight or sign of hunger or thirst it
lived with its tiny soul imprisoned
inside it

  yet even then zulerich dared not
himself drink the elixir though his
work was exhausting his strength and
his heart was growing weak-its flut-
terings made him take fright at times
for there was a flaw in his experi-
ment true the animal lived without
breath food or water but it was en-
tirely unable to move looking at it
one would take it for dead except for
that glow in its fierce little eyes and
the entire absence of decay

  zulerich set out to mend the flaw
he worked feverishly now knowing
his time was short he did not want
to die with success just within his
reach he did not want to come so
near offering mankind the boon it
craved most of all only to fail when
in sight of his goal

  a year passed before zulerich found
the ingredient lacking in his pale
greenish drops the very simplicity
of the thing had caused him to over-
look it in the beginning and his dis-
covery of it was almost ludicrously
accidental

  one day he had a pail containing a
solution of washing soda near the
windows and was washing down the
dusty glass so that he might see out
over the blighted world and gain
strength from its curse to continue his
work he would allow no one else in
his laboratory and washed the win-
dows himself

  a few spattering drops fell into the
motionless upturned mouth of the rat
where it stood upon the casement
its mouth was open in the same posi-
tion it had held when zulerich had
forced it to receive the life preserving
drops it had stood there a tiny par-
alyzed living statue while the four
seasons of the year had gone by to-
day zulerich had thought to remove
the animal from the windows before
beginning to wash them but as he

had grown older he had grown more
absent minded less able to use the
care and forethought of former times
and this time his carelessness pro-
duced an amazing result

  no sooner had the soda dropped in-
to the rats mouth when it squealed
and scurried for cover the very next
instant it was out nibbling a crust of
cracker the parrot had dropped upon
the floor

  overjoyed zulerich watched the
rat regain the use of its muscles but
anxiety soon crept into his joy the
rat developed hunger hunger fore-
bode decay decay meant death

  pondering this he trembled he
was old he had not much time to
watch and wait even now as a re-
sult of his suspense and relief over
the new discovery of the soda drops
his heart was fluttering alarmingly
and there was something new fright-
ening in its flutterings had his time
come at last now when his precious
experiment was almost completed
perhaps perfected but not yet given
to the life-hungry world

  all the legends he had ever read of
the discovery of elixirs of life had
had their fruits frosted just before the
eating was it to be so with him
was this the end

  he thought of his drops quickly
he stepped over to the table he
snatched up the pale green vial dusty
from long idleness on the shelf he
measured off the drops his hand
trembled so that the vial itself
dropped to the floor and split its pre-
cious fluid but he drank the drops
in the measuring glass then he
reached for the soda water sitting just
within reach of the touch of his hand

he could not move he had for-
gotten forgotten that he would
be unable to bring the soda to his
mouth he had overlooked a very vi-
tal thing what was to be done
nothing there was nothing he could
do but sit and wait-a neighbor might
pass he sat immovable as though
cut in stone he could not move even
an eyelid he was frightened

  no neighbor passed who saw him
a week went by


startling stories

  the rat played all over the room
it came out mockingly upon the table
before him zulerich regarded it
closely it was not breathing

  another week passed before anyone
came into the house the rat had be-
come bolder and zulerich had used
his enforced leisure to observe it he
knew his experiment had been a suc-
cess the rat only consumed food to
replace its physical energy it needed
fuel only for movement running
about the room which of course was
a method of decay but the rat needed
no food to support its life zulerich
knew he had discovered the great se-
cret he had attained perpetual life
life which needed food only for its
physical energies for movement not
for life itself

  then as has been said a neighbor
peeped in the neighbors first look
of uneasiness gave way to one of
pained sorrow his face became mel-
ancholy as he saw old zulerich sitting
motionless upon his stool beside his
chemicals that lack of motion could
mean only one thing zulerich tried
to cry out but his voice like his limbs
was paralyzed he tried to croak
even to whisper but there was no
noise at all finally he put all his ap-
peal into the fierce cold fire of his
living eyes the man saw those eyes
bright and living he slammed the
door and fled the room

  zulerich became a world wonder
no one knew what had happened to
him they thought he was dead they
surmised that he had spilled some
mysterious compound over him which
had embalmed him with the look of
life still in his eyes

  undertakers came from long dis-
tances to study him as he sat in his
laboratory they pried and tested
among the fluids in the bottles time
passed months years and still old
zulerich sat a corpse but unburied
motionless but alive but they did
not think he was alive they believed
he had discovered some marvelous em-
balming fluid his house became a
kind of museum in which he was the
only exhibit

  old zulerich growing no older at
all knew all this for he sat there in

aglass case now hearing all they said
and seeing before his eyes all that was
done

  and in the dead of night the rat
with its selfishness and eternal life
and the unselfish chemist in his glass
case would meet again the rat would
scamper across the top of the glass
case in which zulerich sat as stiffly
as though sculptured in stone it
would sit upon the table before him
and stare at him with red spiteful
eyes and zulerich always knew it
by the peculiar scar upon its neck
the rat had what he lacked for one
long year the rat had been frozen as
the man was now and the man had
then given it movement as well as life

  could the rat do as much for the
man would it if it could it hated
him it never brought him the few
drops of alkali he craved

  and one day they packed zulerich
carefully in a case and took him away
from the place that had been his home
when the case was opened he found
himself in a lofty building with the
mummy of a pharaoh on one side of
him and musty relics of other ages all
around him he recognized the old
building for in other days he had
loved to visit it letting his fancies
wander over these fragments of a van-
ished age

  as he sat there upon his stool pro-
tected within his glass case the unal-
terable line of his vision vaulted the
narrow aisles below him and gazed
through the great glass of a tall win-
dow in the opposite wall

out there he watched the throngs
passing people of a day men
who yesterday were babes in mothers
arrns today fighting up the long and
difficult ladder for their fragment of
success to leap tomorrow into ob-
livion from their allotted rung

  things changed manners customs
techniques ways of life but zule-
rich grew no older zulerich did not
change and the rat-the rat to
which zulerich had given the gift of
movement-it too wherever it was
lived on also

  in all the years upon earth it was
bound that these two rat and man
the eternal man



should meet again the rat with its
selfish greed and the chemist with his
unselfish dream had the rat been
seeking him so that it might gloat
over him as it used to do so that it
might scamper upon his case and de-
ride him with its motion the night
roundsman of the museum saw the rat
beat it with his broom mangled it
with his big heel left it upon the floor
until morning so that the cleaners
might take it away

  but before the cleaners came the
next morning one of the scientists who
was studying zulerich saw the rat ly-
ing there upon the floor before the
case its body mangled its eyes so
bright and full of pain he stooped
examined it an exclamation broke
from him the rats heart and lungs
were quiet it seemed quite dead yet
its eyes had the same living look of
the man zulerich in the glass case

thus it came about that the rat
too was placed under observation
set in a tiny case upon a perch just in
front of the glass tomb in which old
zulerich sat looking out upon the
great world through the big window
the rat cut off part of the vision of
the old man his vision in frozen fo-
cus he had perforce to gaze straight
into the eyes of the creature to whom
he had given eternal life and to which
mangled now by broom and heel had
been given eternal pain as well

 life streamed by under the old
mans gaze burning up with decay
yet he held the secret all those people
so much desired he held the con-

necting link between them and eternal
life a few drops of alkaline water
the wires of communication were
down and none had the wisdom nor
the wit to raise them up he had the
secret they had the power if they
only knew

 eager and anxious weary and
bowed down discouraged and broken
the people of the world tramped by
torrents of wasted motion the un-
dying man and the undying rat stared
hatefully at each other the undying
mans mind kept on working ever-
lastingly seeking for some means of
breaking the paralysis of his body so
that he might give eternal life to hu-
manity

  then he learned a great lesson from
a small child

 the child entering the museum
with her father saw the mangled rat
saw the pain and the desire for death
in its eyes and the child begged her
father to kill the little rat as he had
killed her little dog after the auto-
mobile had run over it the father
had smiled down on the child ten-
derly   

  that night zulerichs eyes softened
as he regarded the rat under the bright
glow of the electric lights in his
heart was remorse and a new-found
wisdom he was glad now that he had
been unable to give mankind his mag-
ic formula for he knew now past all
doubt and deep down in the living
soul within his undying body what
the true answer was to all his dreams
he knew that one should improve life
before trying to lengthen it

the life-secret oe mice and men

to quiet his pounding nerves joseph priestley played the flute the soft
piping notes of the instrument had the power to soothe his impatience
while waiting for his latest experiment to fulfill itself

   he sensed that he was at the breathless verge of a tremendous discovery
two mice reposed separately in two jars inverted over water to seal them
off from the outer air the mice sniffed and wiggled but remained on their
little floating platforms he had constructed priestley watched them nar-

rowly wondering it tney wouia unravel a
deep mystery for him

 the gaseous atmosphere in which one of
the mice existed was simply air though
priestley did not know the word in 
this mouse was his control the other
creature however existed in a strange
unknown gas priestley had made this enig-
matic gas by decomposing red mercury

joseph priestley

oxide with heat and collecting its vaporous
by-product he had tested the queer gas to
find it remarkably active it brightened the
flame of a candle thrust into it glowing
charcoal sparkled from its effect and it
made the glowing tip of thin iron wire
actually burst into flame

  what startlingly active gas-originally ex-
tracted from the air through the mercury

oxide phase-accounted for these incredible
phenomena and-the thought almost ter-
rified him in its significance-what effect
could the gas have on life

  his mice would tell him and if the an-
swer was what he thought it was it would
solve one of the most intriguing problems
of mice and men-the secret of their com-
mon breathing processes of the funda-
mental of all life

  the tall thin blond-haired englishman
once a champion of political liberty but now
a liberator of human thought played on he
did not know what tune he was playing on
the flute the notes came in accordance
with his feelings first slow halting as he
told himself he was hoping too much then
rapid surging as his thoughts soared
finally they formed a cadcnce of steady
throbbing beats in tune with his hammer-
ing pulses as he saw one of the mice squirm
fitfully still he played and watched not
daring to hope at what he saw

 the clock ticked on fifteen minutes
passed

  suddenly as  hough he had been stung
priestly flung the instrument aside and ran
forward he kneeled before one jar with
his sharp eager face inches from the mouse
therein it was dying its lungs had con-
sumed the air in its sealed prison and it
could no longer find sustenance for its labor-
ing lungs but the other mouse - in the
strange new gas-lived on

  priestley tender-hearted rescued the dy-
ing mouse before it suffocated then he
took up a vigil beside the other jar the
second mouse lived on another fifteen min-
utes before it too started to choke and fall
down kicking feebly

  the pieces of the puzzle dove-tailed in his
startling stories

mind in a flash of keen insight there
existed in the air hitherto unsuspected a
constituent gas that had the vital function
of supporting life

  priestley aid not realize the full signifi-
cance of his discovery-that from this fun-
damental fact would be built the entire

structure of future chemistry but he did
know that he had solved a problem that had
gnawed in his own mind for ten years

  priestley picked up his flute again its
trilling notes echoed the thrill in his heart
he had isolated the long-sought gas of life
-oxygen

   rontgens weariness dropped away like a
cloak he began following up this incredi-
ble clue to some vital discovery the crys-
tals were barium platino-cyanide he coated

fate reveals the magic ray

professor wilhelm konrad roentgen found himself very
tired he had so many classes so many exam papers to check of the
students of wurzburg university if only he had more time for research-
more time to delve for the great secrets of science

    tired as he was he began puttering around his little laboratory hardly
knowing what he was doing he snapped on the switch that sent  volts
through a crookes tube a simple apparatus it was-a sealed glass bulb

with two electrodes leading into a vacuum

of one-millionth of an atmosphere of pres-
sure it glowed with greenish phosphor-
escence

rontgen stared at it absently little realiz-
ing that it held a cosmic secret in its radiant
interior

always it glows like swamp-fire he
mumbled aloud in the silence of the crowded
little room he pondered for a moment
tugging at his bushy gray beard then
hunched his stocky shoulders he had no
time to investigate the phenomenon and
it was probably unimportant anyway ja

suddenly his eyes twinkled he carefully
locked the door and then took a strip of
black paper-used for photographic experi-
ments-and cut out a little mannikin he
held this in front of the phosphorescent tube
so that the mannikins shadow was thrown
on the wall the huge silhouette danced in
lively tempo as rontgen twiddled the black
paper

the scientist felt a little ashamed of him-
self for his impulsive act here he was a
fifty-year old man a staid professor on top
of it cutting out paperdolls and casting
shadows on a wall childish he had much
work to do many little experiments to fol-
low through that he had started and those
exam papers had to be marked but he was
so tired   

quite suddenly his sleepy eyes opened
wide where did that strange glow come
from several feet from the crookes tube

why those crystals there on the table
they glowed fiercely like bits of diamond
in the sunshine but it was impossible the
crystals were lying completely in the
shadow of the mannikin no radiance from
the tube struck them at all this was some
trick ja

yet he had to make one conclusive test

he thereupon took a large sheet of the black
paper and covered the crookes tube com-
pletely now no visible radiation at all
came through the opaque barrier he
looked at the crystals again 

himmel he gasped it is magic

for the crystals were shining like big fire-
flies

wilhelm conrad rontgen

 a piece of cardboard with them and held
 this before the covered tube the cardboard
 glowed vividly some invisible radiation
 different from light and able to penetrate
 the black paper stabbed from the tube the
 crystals changed the unseen radiation to
 visible light so much was obvious what
 more did it mean

  the answer came unexpectedly he no-
 ticed a peculiar shadow back of his thumb
 on the crystal screen in every detail it
 was the structure of his thumbs bones
 and when he held his whole hand between
 the crookes tube and the screen the flesh
 seemed stripped away

   the professor became a demon of activity
 tired not any more he placed a key in
 a book put a photographic plate behind it
 and let the new x-rays-x for unknown
startling stories

-impinge on the books cover hours later
he had photographic proof-a dim but defi-
nite picture of a key in a hazy background
that was the paper of the book

  rontgen sat down finally to catch his
breath he had discovered a giant marvel
of science he was a great scientist ja

   but suddenly he bowed his head humbly
 he knew within his heart that the whole
 thing had been accidental fate had picked
 him blindly

   professor rontgen smiled whimsically as
he picked up the little black mannikin from
the floor

 dr- pettenkorehs strange meal

it was after dark old professor max pettenkofer still labored behind
    his desk in the classroom of munich university

    the fools-the infernal blasted fools he muttered his eyes glowing
fiercely bah-they are so stupid

old pettenkofer had been studying the reports of the great bacteriolo-
gist robert koch in connection with the lethal cholera epidemics in india
cholera never rises spontaneously koch had said no healthy man

can ever be attacked by cholera unless he

swallows the common microbe and this
germ can only develop from its like-it can-
not be produced from any other thing or
out of nothing and it is only in the in-
testine of man or in highly polluted water
like that of india that it can grow

old professor pettenkofer was the rabid
chief of the circle of cynics who persisted
in ignoring kochs proofs of the relationship
between germs and death germs mi-
crobes they were sheer nonsense the
professor believed

pettenkofer opened the drawer of his

dr robert koch

desk withdrew a sheet of stationery he
dipped his pen into an inkwell and in a bold
flamboyant script began to scrawl

 my dear doctor koch send me some
of your so-called deadly cholera germs if
i cant prove them harmless ill eat a pound
of arsenic oxide

  then pettenkofer signed his name with a
flourish folded the note and sent it off

  the great koch sent pettenkofer a sealed
glass culture that contained a liquid mix-
ture swarming with the microscopic car-

riers of death there were enough of the
invisible messengers of murder thriving in
that culture to decimate the population of a

city

when the culture of deadly cholera germs
arrived at the university pettenkofer sent
for his colleagues and the medical journal
writers this was pettenkofers big dramat-
ic moment in life and like a masterful
showman he intended to make the most of it

he held the deadly culture in his hand
for all to see there was a concerted gasp
from his associates as he broke the seal
his voice husky with emotion pettenkofer
addressed his group of non-microbe be-
lievers

 the great dr koch claims there are
enough deadly cholera germs present in this
mixture to wipe out an army now watch

  suddenly with a swift movement the fool-
hardy scientist swallowed the entire con-
tents of the culture

  now let us see if i get cholera he said
scornfully lighting his pipe and puffing
away complacently

 nobody knows what grim thoughts may
have been harbored in pettenkofers brain
as he downed his murderous appetizer
maybe he was so confident that his own
the- -ua right that cholera was caused by
the predisposition of the individual rather
than by mythical microbes that he was ab-
solutely fearless about the consequences of
his feat or perhaps there was just a little
part of him that believed in koch    and
was afraid at any rate he smiled at death

  nothing ever happened to pettenkofer to
the bafflement of medical science for koch
was right we know and the failure of the
mad pettenkofer to come down with cholera
remains to this day an enigma without even
the beginning of an explanation

  a few days after the incident pettenkofer
wrote smartly to koch

  i have swallowed millions of your alleged
fatal bacilli and have not even had a cramp
in my stomach

  who was it that said    fools rush in
where angels fear to tread

x columbus of space

it was sunday afternoon november   in the small church of a
little village on the outskirts of liverpool young jeremiah horrocks
stepped falteringly to the pulpit the male choir had just finished singing
the last hymn and the mellow tones of the old pump-organ were drifting
away

jeremiah horrocks surveyed the small audience of church-goers before
him but he did not see their faces he spoke ardently of the words of god

but he did not hear them for that after-
noon horrocks was thinking rather of the
works of god    the earth the sun and
the planets

  but of all the worlds in the solar system
one alien planet cloud-veilcd venus ho-
vered before jeremiah horrocks eyes with
the clarity of a blazing meteor plunging
through sable darkness for all night be-
fore and the following morning jeremiah
horrocks had watched that planet until his
eyes burned like fiery coals

  jeremiah horrocks was only twenty years
old that afternoon as he stood in the pulpit
holding his congregation rapt with the
glories of god but the two hundred dol-
lars salary he received each year for con-
ducting the church services was not enough
to bring him the glories of the universe
horrocks telescope was only a cheap one
costing him sixty cents the most he could
afford

  a sixty-cent telescope but jeremiah hor-
rocks treasured it more than an astronomer
today would value the -inch giant reflec-
tor at mt wilson crude though the tele-
scope was almost an optical toy it had en-
abled horrocks to make calculations which
predicted that there would be a transit of
venus across the sun that very afternoon

  no astronomer in the world had ever yet
observed a transit of venus the celestial
phenomenon wherein the white little planet
crossed the path of the blinding sun ap-
peared directly in front of it so that the
white planet became a black disc by con-
trast

  galileo had never witnessed it  he had
too many other cosmic miracles to study
keppler copernicus-they had never
thought of it now if jeremiah horrocks
calculations were accurate he would be the
first human being on earth to witness this
heavenly wonder

  horrocks hastened through with his serv-
ices that afternoon if he were late  if
he were to miss the spectacle  it would
be years before he had a chance to see it
again

  he hurried to his humble home that after-
noon his pulses racing madly in his strong

young body lie was but a boy but he
stood on the threshold of the frontier wills
the men who mapped the skies

  once inside his house the young astrono-
mer entered the room that was both his ob-
servatory and sleeping quarters the room
was completely darkened in preparation for
the experiment before a small aperture by
the window stood his simple telescope the
suns glaring rays pouring into its lens
emerged from the eye piece at its other end
casting a vivid image upon a white cloth
that horrocks had hung upon the wall

  he watched breathlessly there was
nothing on the white screen as yet except
the steady white light of the sun what
was the matter the young astronomer
was puzzled hadnt his mathematical cal-
culations been accurate wouldnt venus
hurl itself across the surface of the sun
wouldnt-

  wait a minute    what was that were
his weary eyes tortured by hours of con-
centrated observation deceiving him

 the planet venus there it was-a
miniature black disc appearing just beyond
the suns corona horrocks didnt breathe
an eternity later the black disc rotating at
about the speed of twenty miles a second
showed across the suns chromosphere

  jeremiah horrocks kept his eyes glued to
the white screen that afternoon his face
flushed as he watched the planet venus
careen blithely in its orbit across the flam-
ing surface of the sun it was the thrill of
a lifetime

  for horrocks those moments were a life-
time the young preacher-astronomer died
two years later at the early age of twenty-
two sir john herschel the great astron-
omer of years to come called horrocks the
pride and boast of british astronomy if
he had lived horrocks might have become
the greatest astronomer in the history of the
world

  but horrocks died happily he had lived
to chart the path of venus across the sun
-and had been fortunately destined to see
visual proof of his remarkable calculations

absolute zero

editor science question box

    if a body is supplied with heat its temperature rises starting with any temperature
one can perfectly well imagine a higher temperature at which the body contains more
heat is it also possible to imagine a temperature lower than any initial one or is
there a degree of cold beyond which it is impossible to take still more heat from the
body-l e princeton new jersey

  the answer to your question was already
known in the nineteenth century there does
exist a lowest temperature known as ubsolute
zero by the ordinary fahrenheit scale this
lowest temperature is about  below zero

  once such a concept was established scien-
tists realized the importance of investigating
the field of low temperatures experimental
physicists began a long race to a new goal
the temperature of absolute zero records
were made and broken lower and lower
temperatures were reached a new region nf
investigation was conquered but by no means
fully exhausted scattered throughout the
civilized world today are many low-tempera-
tuip laboratories in which scientists are still
working toward the same goal

  scientists have reached temperatures differ-
ing from that of absolute zero by something
like a hundredth of a degree it would per-
haps seem that the goal is almost reached a
hundredth of a degree is not very much but
sciuntists realize that the problem is far from
completion each small step further is more
difficult than the previous one and perhaps
more important since each step may reveal

aspects of the structure of matter in a region
of kreat interest from the point of view of
modern physics

  an example will show the difficulties con-
nected with the investigation let us imagine
that we are trying to approach a great wall
in some fantastic world strange things hap-
pen as we come nearer the wall an uncanny
metamorphosis takes place all our dimen-
sions and consequently the length of our
steps become smaller and smaller our di-
mensions and our steps diminish at such a
rate that they approach zero as our distance
from the wall approaches zero

  in this fantastic world we are bound to suf-
fer disappointment at first the wall seemed
only a finite distance away but we cun bgin
to understand that we can never approach
only by ever-diminishing steps something
like this happens in the march of science to-
ward absolute zero to go a thousandth ol
a degree lower is an incomparably greater
task now than it was to make the same step
at a temperature only a few degrees higher

how well do animals see

  dr john warkentin of the university of
rochester recently devised a plan by which
even the most bored and stolid creatures will

sive information as to how well they can see
e places an animal at the bottom of a stand-
ing cvllnder lighted from above large enough
to contain the animal without crowding

  on the walls of the cylinder are vertical
stripes of black and white the largest of
these stripes is five inches across the smaller
ones only one-sixteenth of an inch across

  all the animal cun see when inside the cyl-
inder is the striped wall and its own body
the wall is slowly turned and if the animal
can really see the stripes even the most slug-
gish eyes or head turn and follow the move-
ment smaller and smaller stripes are used
until a stripe-width i reached to which the
animal will not respond this-it seems fair
to assume-is the limit of the keenness of
that creatures vision

  for n few- animals that easily follow the
-inch stripes with their eyes even nar-
rower threads are employed the very finest
being no more than  inch in diameter
these tests of course do not measure the

almost down to zero

  although some might assume that larger
eyes give better sight the tests on frogs and
toads revealed poor vision alligators do not
see well either yet most of the other rep-
tiles have very good eyes all tvpes of
snakes are keen-eyed except when they are
shedding their skins of which the cornea or
eye-cover is a part turtles vision is really
good even though their eyes are but beads

  as expected most creatures of the forests
and the fields have very good eyesisht those
creatures that must walk at night and those
that fly high above the ground have been
given the keen vision they need and the cats
and birds are characteristically clear-eyed
and able to see the fine lines in the turning

wild ones could see better than the tame
ones-ed

the fate of the earth

editor science question box

    in the annual report of the smithsonian institution i noticed that professor henry
 norris rttssell of princeton university claims that death by rusting rather than by
 freezing when the sun goes out may possibly be the eventual fate of the earth can you
 clarify this statement-e o b berkeley calif

  oxygen as everybody now knows is the
 real essence of the breath of life if it were
 to be wholly removed from the atmosphere of
 this planet we should all perish-bird and
 man toadstool and tree some rocks contain
 oxygen locked up in chemical combination
 sometimes this combination can be cracked
 sis by volcanic action then the oxygren is
 turned loose largely as carbon dioxide which
 is eagerly seized upon by plants which ex-
 tract lhe carbon for food manufacture and
 return half of the oxygen free thus the at

 mosph-re is replenished

   but thre are other rocks very abundant
 too containing iron in the partly oxidized

 ferrous form this ferrous oxide   thirsty
 for more oxygen to complete its transforma-
 tion into the ferric form ferric oxide is
 most familiar to us as common rust but it is
 also responsible for most of the common red
 rocks and soils

   evidently professor russell suggests that
 eventually the ferrous minerals will absorb
 all the oxygen in the air or yet to be released
 into the air locking it up in ferric minerals
 the barth will then be without the oxygen-
 breathing life as we know it this stage irrny
 perhaps already exist on mars the ruat-nd
 planet but it will take more than a billion
 years to occur here on earth-ed

please explain this term to me-in simple lan-

   if you pick up a pen write on a piece of pa-
 per and lay the pen down again you are using
 nine therbligs the little known term ther-
 blig was one of the major topics of discussion
 at one of the sessions of the american society
 of mechanical engineers recently

   a therblig explained prof ralph m barnes
 if the university of iowa is a fundamental
 hand motion used in performing different
 kinds of work there are  basic hand mo-
 tions out of which all manual motions can be
 fashioned and described

   by motion picture studies of workers ways
 to cut waste hand motion in many industrial
 operations are being learned so that the
 workers can turn out more work with less
 energy and effort

  	grasp pen grasp

  	carry pen to paper transport loaded

  	position pen for writing position

  	write use

  	return pen to holder transport loaded

  	insert pen in holder pre-position

  	let go pen release

  	move hand to paper transport empty

  by analysis of motion studies it is often

  possible to save materials as well as time
  prof barnes cited a case of revising methods
  of painting refrigerators in which there was
  a reduction in time of fi per ceit a reduc-

bathed in the soft glow of a
tropic moon the island looked
peaceful and quiet to don
mason there was certainly no ink-
ling in his mind of the incredible
menace lurking beneath its slumber-
ing surface

 he was standing beside helen
montry at the rail of her uncles
yacht drinking in the cool night
breezes it had been a long hot cruise
of three thousand miles from san
francisco with a single stop at hon-
olulu

  helen montry stiffened suddenly
and leaned forward over the rail
straining her eyes toward shore

  look don she said pointing
isnt that some sort of glow at the
center of the island behind the cliff
this island is supposed to be unin-
habited yet it looks like a light or
group of lights

  probably just the moons reflection
on smooth rock formations don ma-
son returned casually he slipped an
arm around the girl there is a much
lovelier reflection in your eyes he
added softly

  helen montry squeezed his arm but
continued to stare at the island bulk-
ing mysteriously against the backdrop
of star-stippled sky

  ive noticed that glow too an-
other voice broke in behind them
very odd-

they started dr raoul montry
helens uncle had approached si-

with a desperate wrench mason swung the
door open 
science island

  i

lently don mason straightened
though he was off duty and out of
uniform and saluted

  the luxury of a comfortable inheri-
tance at birth had not prevented ra-
oul montry from becoming a hard-
working scientist and his private re-
searches in biology had gained him
great professional distinction

  his deep-set eyes now held a queer
look of anticipation

  perhaps this is the place he mur-
mured he turned to the young first
mate ive informed the captain that
youll take me ashore in the launch
first thing in the morning

  aye aye sir said mason crisply
he hesitated then went on but may

i	ask sir what you expect to find on
a deserted island halfway between the
philippines and hawaii

he was wondering too why they
had practically scoured this re-
gion of the pacific near the phoenix
islands they had stopped at a half
dozen bits of land as though on an in-
tensive search for something of which
only dr montry was aware mason
hardly expected an illuminative an-
swer men of the crew were not sup-
posed to ask the yachts owner his
business

  but dr montry surprised him

  i think ill tell you mason he
said slowly youre an intelligent
young man and i like you i think
helen agrees with me on that he
smiled at the girls quick blush and
went on with a serious note in his
voice

  im looking for dr arndt knurd
formerly my collaborator in biologi-
cal research he vanished five years
ago from our laboratory taking with
him all our notes and formulae on a
new discovery and incidentally a
hundred thousand dollars of my
money ive had private investiga-
tors trying to pick up his trail since
the disappearance just last month
they traced him or rather got wind
of huge shipments of apparatus sent
from melbourne to some unnamed
island in the phoenix group thats
why were here to find which island
-and dr knurd

  but why sir after five years ma-
son asked he knew it wasnt the
money that discovery-it was an
important one

  the scientist nodded

  vital he said we developed a
method of transplanting living brains
-we used dogs-into an artificial me-
dium of life disconnected entirely
from the rest of the body we made
electrically-motivated robot bodies
with living canine brains operating
them almost as deftly as their natu-
ral bodies we had devised a way of
transmitting nerve-impulses along
wires

  mason felt the girl shudder against
him he knew his skin was crawling
a little too at the rather gruesome ac-
count

  and you think he said that dr
knurd came to this island or some is-
land to-well to do what

  thats what i wonder dr mon-
trys kindly eyes looked deeply wor-
ried my agents also found out that
he had contacted four other scientists
they have disappeared from public
life professor harkman the famous
metallurgist was one dr yorsky
well-known russian surgeon an-
other and walsh and hapgood en-
gineer and physicist respectively for
five years these scientific minds have
been together on some island what
does it mean dr knurd himself is
the-well unscrupulous sort he
may-

  a sharp intake of breath from helen
interrupted

  whats that her trembling arm
pointed toward the sheer cliff back of
the islands broad beach something
is moving there-

 the men stared a formless
shadow pierced by what seemed to be
greenly gleaming eyes moved across
the cliffs unlighted background
they could not make out its shape or
size the glow of the mysterious eyes
deepened and its twin beams seemed
to stab out toward them and focus on
the boat

 don mason sensed danger a
strange feeling of lassitude had stolen
through his body in a flash he knew
that the twin-beam was bringing them


startling stories

paralysis but even as his hand
darted for the automatic in his pocket
he felt his fingers go limp

 helen gave a choked scream and
folded up on the deck floor dr mon-
try panting was trying to drag him-
self along the rail with muscles that
had turned to water hoarse shouts
came from below from the crews
quarters

  cursing and trying to fight the grip-
ping paralysis mason felt his legs
turn to rubber the deck came up into
his face like a club he did not feel
the blow his whole body was numb
and the numbness was creeping in-
sidiously into his brain

  he made one last effort with a
groan and then gave up as a blot of
inkiness crushed his mind   

  don mason lay still for a while
when he came back to dreamy con-
sciousness he still felt numb and
wasnt quite sure that he was wide
awake yet he was even more uncer-
tain when he moved his eyes and
started to look around

  his first blurred glance left him
with a sinking sensation of unnatural
smallness which mason vaguely at-
tributed to the dizzy reaction of con-
sciousness he closed his eyes for a
moment and then cautiously opened
them again his eyes focused on a
shelf diagonally across from where he
lay a shelf which held laboratory
flasks that appeared to be several feet
high

  mason blinked were his eyes de-
ceiving him those flasks shouldnt
normally be more than about a half
a foot in size

  his eyes moved slightly downward
and they grew wide with astonishment
as they fastened on an instrument
the instrument was simply and un-
mistakably a microscope-but a micro-
scope which appeared to be as large
as himself

  still feeling hazy and numb mason
started to think slowly and ponder-
ously something was obviously
wrong totally illogical it was crazy
a microscope was a microscope and
should be only a foot or so long yet
unless his eyes were deceiving him
here was a microscope that appeared

to be as large as himself ah that was
it appeared to be then his eyes
were deceiving him but what was
causing the illusion

  suddenly and startlingly his brain
flashed to full consciousness rela-
tivity of course with a terrified
feeling of helplessness mason real-
ized that the reason the microscope
was so large was because he was some-
how so small the microscope was
as large as he was all right he told
himself wryly-but he was only a foot
high

  mason forced himself to look fur-
ther and everything he saw seemed to
verify his conclusions he appeared
to be in a gigantic chamber of rock
without windows he was lying on
the cold stone floor with helen beside
him the girl too he observed was
his subnormal size bright electric
lights unnaturally far ahead shone
down revealing a long huge table on
which lay various implements of gross
size among them the microscope it
was a laboratory mason realized a
normal laboratory with everything in
it looking colossal to his reduced self

  his gaze turned further toward the
end of the great table and what he saw
there made him draw his breath in
sharply two figures were standing
near the table-two monstrous-look-
ing forms of copper-red metal

  robots mechanized travesties of
the human shape with elongated
cylindrical heads and bodies jointed
legs and arms both of them towered
incredibly high from masons supine
view

  robots and a laboratory the mys-
tery of it brought a sharp unease al-
most a hysterical terror to masons
dizzied mind it was obviously some
of dr knurds work from what dr
montry had told him about knurd
the scientist had stolen the secret of
robot brain-control he had come to
this remote island evidently to apply
the method to human-sized robots

  mason had already taken it as a mat-
ter of course that the two robots he
saw were controlled by human brains
there was no other possibility his
mind raced on almost without his
volition what was knurds purpose
science island

behind such a coldly scientific act
what was his reason for reducing his
captives-or at least mason himself
and helen so far-to such insignifi-
cant proportions just how he had
accomplished it was relatively unim-
portant

there had been deep rumbling
sounds in masons ears since he
had awakened he listened closely
now realizing they were the mechan-
ical voices of the robot-men

  i think you are close to success
professor harkman boomed one ro-
bots voice he straightened up from
the instrument over which he had been
bending those metallo-organisms
youve created are unquestionably
alive

  don mason listened with a beating
heart professor harkman one of the
four dr montry had mentioned
harkman was or had been the worlds
foremost metallurgist he had long
been an advocate of the theory of me-
tallic life how did he and this dis-
covery fit into the puzzle of this un-
derground cavern of science

  yes dr knurd replied the other
robot they are alive

  mason caught his breath so the
first robot was the thieving dr knurd
himself he had had himself made
into a robot his own scheming
clever brain lay within the metal body
controlling it as though it were his
nature-given body that made the
whole situation still more perplexing
and mason wondered just how as-
tounding the answer to it all was

  he listened further not making the
slightest move as yet

  the second robot whose controlling
brain had been that of professor hark-
man continued

  yes alive micro-organisms com-
posed mainly of iron as far back as
 dr molisha of japan described
the toxothrix a germ found in air
whose weight was fifty percent iron
before that only the red corpuscles
of animal blood were known to carry
iron stanford university confirmed
molishas report in  i was one of
the men who followed his interesting
research i went further i thought

of mutating the toxothrix into a viru-
lent metal-germ ive succeeded here
this is a great thrill to me-

  yes yes cut in dr knurd his
uninflected robot-voice could not ex-
press impatience but it was implied
go on with your work professor
the germs must breed faster-as fast
as pneumococci for instance when
you produce that germ-culture we
will have the great force with which
to conquer the world then as prac-
tically eternal metal supermen we
will rule mankind for ages

  masons brain reeled a little incred-
ible as it sounded that was the aim dr
knurd had had in mind with his theft
of the robot secret rule of mankind 
the man was a monomaniac-a cold-
blodded scientific napoleon

  the robot-form of the metallurgist
hesitated with a stoppered culture
tube in its hand

  it may be dangerous to go on he
said warningly if it multiplies as
fast as most organic germs no metal it
diseased could stand up against it
it would eat into the strongest tough-
est steel if it were dispersed
throughout the world in a few months
all metals would rot to powder and
collapse and dont forget dr
knurd we are made of metal

  dont worry about such details
retorted the other robot im a biolo-
gist ill know how to handle the
germs ill find a way to send them
into opposing armies without danger
to ourselves think of it professor
a bomb bursting in their midst a
cloud of germs dispelling through
their air all their metallic imple-
ments of warfare turning to diseased
dust as the metal-germs voraciously
attack all metals within reach their
cannon crumpling and their aircraft
rising a few feet then diving earth-
ward like broken toys

don mason hearing this prophetic
recital shuddered to the core of his
being had the brain of dr knurd
divorced from its true body also re-
nounced all claim to human feeling
the robot-masters voice droned on
those cannon could defeat us you
know and those stinging aircraft

heres wishing startling stories a
super-success in the science fiction world

  i think that your policy of running long
complete novels is an excellent one at
last we authors will have a chance to get a
load of wordage-plus well-complicated
plots-off our chest

quer humanity in the shortest possi-

able metal bodies and two powerful

vian offensive force of the metallic

  the door opened again and another
coppery-red robot stalked in saluting
knurd following was a third robot
which came up with slow almost fal-
tering steps

 here is the new menial an-
nounced the first robot

  oh yes grated knurds micro-
phonic voice you have worked fast
yorsky good

  the famous russian surgeon dr
yorsky-the third of knurds clique
of five great minds mason grew bit-
ter at the thought of such sparkling
intellects pooling their genius in this
unworthy cause

  the gleaming lenses of knurds
robot-body turned to survey the third
robot

  can you hear me dr montry
knurd asked

  yes i hear you returned the
other robot in a hoarse mutter as
though unused to its new organs of
metal

  blood ran down don masons lips as
he bit them to keep from crying aloud
dr montry but he was no longer
the human dr montry his brain had
been transplanted into a robot body
this man who had so lately been a
living breathing being at his side was
now another of the inhuman monsters
of metal mason felt as if all the uni-
verse had turned upside down

  then he began to wonder how long
he had been unconscious if the opera-
tion had been performed in the mean-
time for days or more likely the
transplanting process had been short-
ened to a few hours by yorskys tech-
nique in russia he had performed
brain operations in half the time any
other surgeon could mason turned
his attention back to the robots

  you hear me continued knurd
and you will always obey me i am
the robot-master you have been made
a menial-robot dr montry since i
know you would never willingly serve
science island



me i hated to have it done since you
have a wonderful mind your brain
has been reduced in capacity it is a
delicate operation that the skillful
dr yorsky performs so well one
little cerebral nerve twisted aside and
the entire prefrontal cortex is short-
circuited you have no voluntary
powers-only the ability to obey or-
ders the occupants of three other
ships that foundered here-under the
influence of our paralysis-ray-have
been made menial-robots also only
the original five of us are master-
robots we will rule the world when
the time comes

  knurd went on tauntingly

  you have had a great part in this
venture dr montry though unwit-
tingly our first discovery-of a solu-
tion in which the naked brain could
live and transmit nerve-impulses-
was the start of it all i thought of
a robot-race right away why have
ailing mortal bodies when you could
have immortal metal ones i con-
tacted my four famous colleagues and
they finally agreed we pooled re-
sources came to this island and car-
ried out our plans

 we became robots we had per-
fected the robot mechanism elaborate-
ly powerful batteries supply power
we have far more strength and pow-
ers at the disposal of our controlling
brains than we had with our normal
bodies we found our mental proc-
esses working better too unhindered
by biological vagaries we developed
the paralysis-ray the heat-beam the
brain-reducing method for menials
and a metallic germ-culture which will
defeat mankinds armies we will
have complete control for ages

wr montry made no denuncia-
tion don mason realized he
couldnt his brain had been reduced
and lacked voluntary powers dr
montry could hear and understand
but he couldnt denounce or defy he
could only obey as a virtual slave it
was a horrible fate that mason real-
ized might soon be his and helens

 you may go dr montry com-
manded knurd go to harkmans
laboratory and help him for the pres-
ent

  the robot of dr montry left with-
out a word

  knurd spoke to yorsky make the
members of the yachts crew into
menials we can use them

 how about those two yorsky
pointed to mason and helen

  no returned knurd im going
to use them in a test ive been trying
to make an organic germ-culture more
virulent than any known human dis-
ease in case our other methods fail
to subdue mankind ill loose this
germ among them and bring them to
terms

  the robot-body of yorsky left

  knurd glanced at mason and helen
and then at several culture jars on his
work table mason realized there
wasnt much time he had pretended
unconsciousness up till now but when
knurds back was turned he reached
over and shook the girl she had been
sighing and twisting and he knew she
was close to awakening

  helens eyes fluttered open to be
safe mason clapped his hand over her
mouth and whispered rapidly in her
ear telling her to be quiet no matter
how astonished she was at what she
saw for the first time the girl
nodded bravely checking her emo-
tions as she looked around

  we must get out of this room
mason finished before dr knurd de-
cides to try some new culture on us
well try for the door

  he had already noticed with beat-
ing pulses that yorsky had failed to
close the wooden door tight when he
left knurds back was still turned
mason quietly and quickly rose to his
feet and helped the girl up they
both felt stiff and sore and heavy-
limbed mason figured that this must
be because their normal weight was
concentrated in their smaller bulk at
the expense of their muscular power

  hugging the wall and tiptoeing the
two humans crept toward the door
the slight sounds they made were
overshadowed by the low internal
science

humming of the robots electrical
machinery

  when they were within a dozen
yards of the door almost at the heels
of the gigantic-seeming robot knurd
turned around and took a few steps
toward where they had lain he
stopped suddenly seeing they were
gone and his odd cylindrical head
twisted in search

  run for it shouted mason push-
ing the girl ahead they reached the
door there was only a slight crack
too narrow for even their small bodies
to squeeze through mason grabbed
the edge with his hands and strained
to pull the huge thick oaken door
open it failed to give and mason re-
doubled his efforts with helen help-
ing desperately

  knurd had now discovered them
he gave a tinny shout and strode
toward them at the same time from
the gaping eye-sockets of his head a
greenish glow stabbed and began to
focus in their direction mason re-
membered the green glow at the ship
-the paralysis-ray the robot bodies
were equipped with them and with
god knew what other horrible forces
supplied by their enigmatic internal
apparatus

with a desperate wrench mason
swung the door open a few
more inches and helen stumbled
through mason sprang after her and
felt the tail-end of a numbing sensa-
tion just in time or the paralysis-
ray would have focused

  a long hall was revealed as im-
mense to them as a cathedral mason
ran down the passageway with an
arm around the girl back of them the
door they had quitted opened widely
and knurds robot came out he
broke into a ponderous run after
them

  mason realized they would be
caught unless they found a door open
somewhere the stone hall ended
abruptly further ahead the robot
shouting gained on them rapidly
with its longer stride then twin
beams of reddish iridescence shot
from the robots strange eye-sockets

where they first focused several feet
ahead mason saw the stone smoke and
chip the heat-beam its touch
would spell a horrible death

  here gasped helen jerking aside
in here

 a door was slightly ajar they
squeezed through the large chamber
seemed to be a storeroom a half
dozen robots were picking up crated
objects and piling them neatly they
were menials and paid no attention to
the two humans who stood in plain
sight there last command had been
to stack the apparatus no command
had been given them about the
humans

  but suddenly knurds roaring voice
sounded as he came down the hall

  grab those two humans he was
shouting any menials who see them
-catch them if they try to escape
use the paralysis-ray or heat-beam

  immediately the menial-robots left
their task and came for the two hu-
mans the greenish glow of paralysis
and the reddish of the heat-beam be-
gan to stab from all directions mason
played a sudden hunch and ran
straight for them dragging the start-
led helen along all the beams fo-
cused over them safely they darted
between the clumsy legs of the slow-
witted creatures and before they could
turn around had found temporary
refuge behind the storerooms piled-
up contents

  knurds robot charged in cursing
at the menials for letting their prey
escape for a while it was a cat and
mouse game up and down the long
aisles of the stacked merchandise
because of their small size and the
dim lighting mason and helen were
able to elude cornering by the clumsy
menials as they slipped around boxes
and hugged shadows

  mason had his automatic out but
realized it would be a puny weapon
against the metal monsters and now
they were tiring rapidly the robots
could go on and on tirelessly but in
this strenuous game mason and helen
were reaching a limit of endurance

  they saw several doors but all were
tightly closed finally the inevitable

happened and they were cornered
the menials and dr knurd converged
on them the scientists eyes radiated
the paralysis-ray and it began to focus
in their direction they were lost

  mason made one futile shot with his
automatic aiming for one of knurds
eyes an instantaneous shutter clicked
over the eye and the bullet thudded
harmlessly against metal knurd had
developed the robot-bodies into re-
markable engines of offense and de-
fense

  suddenly a door at their backs
opened a robot came out precipi-
tately shouting hoarsely a large
tube of something sailed over his head
and smashed against the nearest wall
an oily solution splashed against the
stone

  mason did not stop to figure what it
meant but simply accepted fates little
finger and shoved the girl into the
rom beyond the door he had seen
there was only one menial-robot in
there perhaps there was a chance
of escaping him

  the door closed behind them the
menial-robot instantly came at them
it was a laboratory but the benches
behind which they might hide were
at the other side of the room they
were cornered the robot loomed up
monstrously and extended its steely
hands

  cursing mason fired his automatic
wildly the bullets spanged harm-
essly against metal then the green
paralysis-ray shot from the creatures
eyes and mason felt his limbs go
rubbery helen collapsed on the floor
at his side

  caught at last masons last
thoughts were bitter as the paralysis
bit into his brain

sensing that he had been out for
many hours mason opened his
eyes to find his vision obstructed by
something shimmering puzzled he
looked out at a distorted view then
he saw helen a few feet away stand-
ing upright in what was simply a bell-
jar mason realized that he too was
inclosed in one

it suddenly struck mason forcibly

 according to the govomraent health bulletin no b-s at least
  of the adult population of the united states are bo lug attacked
 by the disease known as athletes foot

 usually the disease starts between tbo tooe little watery blisters
 form and ihe skin cracks and peels after a while the itching
 becomes intense and you feel as though you would like to scratch
 off all the skin

beware of it spreading

 often the dlsoaso travels all over the bottom of the feet the
 soles of your foci become red and swollen the skin also cracks
 and peek and the itching becomes worse and none

 get rid of this disease aa quickly as possible because it is very
 contagious ajid it may go to your hands or even to the under arm
 or crotch of the lens	

 most people who have athlete s foot have tried all kinds of
 remedies to euro it without success ordinary germicides anti-
 septics salve or ointments seldom do any good

heres how to treat it

 the germ that causes the disease is known as tinea trichophyton
 it buries itself deep in the tissues of the skin and is very hard to
 kill a test made shows it takes is minutes of boll big to kill the
 germ so you can see why the ordinary remedies are unsuccessful

 h f was develoied solely for the purpose of treating athletes
 foot it is a llciuid that penetrates and dries quickly you just
 paint the affected parts it peels off the tissue of the skin where
 the germ breeds

itching stops immediately

 as odn as you apply h f you will find that the itching is imme-
 diately relieved you should paint the infected parts with h f
 night and morning until your fet are well usually this takes from
 three to ten days although in severo cases it may take longer or in
 mild cases less time

 quick wav it brings you relief especially if you are one of those
 who have tried for years to get rid of athletes foot without success

just how small they were here they
were two grown human beings stand-
ing upright in ordinary laboratory
bell-jars and unable to reach the tops
but what did it mean was knurd
perhaps about to test his germ culture
on them

  blind fear of being thus inclostd
like a guinea-pig struck mason and he
kicked at the prison wall of glass-
like material he could see helen
just a few feet away pounding with
her little fists against her crystalline
prison hysterical panic was in her
face her mouth was open as though
she were screaming but mason
couldnt hear a sound

  rage now ripped masons tattered
nerves rage that the girl he loved
must suffer these cruelties at the
hands of monsters of metal he fired
the last remaining shots of his auto-
matic at the bell-jar wall it was not
glass it did not break the confined
reverberations nearly threw him off
his feet

  he looked up now to see the menial-
robot who had captured them looming
over the jars the red heat-beam
came in a twin stream from its cryptic
eyes and focused on the glass a line
of flame traveled down the rounded
surface and split the jar open like a
pod metallic hands that did not
know feeling grasped the molten ma-
terial and shoved it aside

  then helens transparent prison
was similarly treated soon mason
and helen were free and leaped for
one anothers arms the menial robot
seemed to stare down at them be-
nignly then it sank to the floor with
a peculiarly soft thud as though
the metal had turned to putty

  helen    don   it called tin-
nily

  mason and helen stared down from
the table-top at the fallen robot

  dr montry cried mason in sud-
den realization

  yes its i came the metallic tones
of the robot

fairly clear of them hurry and escape

heads all the steel beams and brac-

  but our size stammered mason
were little pygmies-

  no you arent snapped back dr
montrys robot youre normal siee
always have been relatively youre
small yes because everything in this
place is over-sized dr knurd had to
make his robots big in order to fit into
them all the apparatus necessary
therefore all else including the in-
struments had to be in proportion

  the robot-body squirmed and parts
of it sloughed away as though it were
diseased flesh

  good-by - hurry -  said the
scientist then the cylindrical head
cracked away from the torso a mo-
ment later the metal fell in on itself
to reveal something nakedly pinkish
in a glass-like container

  mason smashed the object with his
pistol-butt with closed eyes knowing
lie was doing a good thing and leaped
away helen was sobbing as he relent-
lessly dragged her into a run   

  an hour later from the height of
the cliff in the bowels of which dr
knurd had dug his incredible head-
quarters they watched as the massive
rock roof fell in burying its secret

wants novels

by charles ward

  here is mv vote for a companion maga-
zine to thrilling wonder sto-
ries containing full-length novels the
best stories you or your predecessors ever
had were the serials and long novels or-
dinary short stories do not provide one an
opportunity to become acquainted with the
characters

  the longer stories would i am certain
attract many new readers once the new
magazine comes out-and i am sure it will

associated with any of these ailments

piles and rectal disorders arc rather common ailments
among many men and women over -as well as
younger people there is medical authority to the effect
that these disorders do not tend to correct themselves
and that self-applied medicines generally afford temporary
relief only ask yourself then frankly if it is wise to
needlessly expose yourself to the ever-present danger that
some incurable condition of a malignant nature may
develop for this annoyance pain embarrassment and
danger is generally needless because rectal troubles can
usually be corrected with little loss of time and without
staying in hospital or without ether chloroform or rad-
ical surgery
