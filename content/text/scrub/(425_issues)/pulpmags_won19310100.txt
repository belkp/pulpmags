wonders of the vacuum

by hugo gernsback

ll nature abhors a vacuum

so runs the well-known say-
ing attributed to descartes
although it probably was used
long before descartes was
boxll

like many similar popular sayings that
under consideration may be classed as almost
completely false indeed all nature does not
abhor the vacuum quite the contrary well
over  of nature that is the entire visible
and invisible universe is itself a vast vac-
uum all the cosmos with the exception of
the widely-separated locations filled with mat-
ter such as the suns and planets is a void
and this void itself is an extraordinary good
vacuum

science today knows that if you rise 
miles above the surface of the earth you will
find as high a vacuum or better than that
contained in an up-to-date x-ray tube which
is about as good a vacuum as can be pro-
duced with our most modern machinery

indeed if it were not for this almost per-
fect vacuum which constitutes practically
the entire universe there would be no such
thing as the motion of the heavenly bodies
the earth and all of the other solar planets
maintain their perpetual motion around the
sun for only one reason and that is because
the planets move in a perfect frictionless
medium-a vacuum

if there were no such vacuum the planets
with their satellites would long have come
to a standstill

let us suppose for example that the
entire visible universe were filled with a
fairly good though not perfect vacuum
such as that found in our incandescent lamps
where quite a few air molecules are left
then the friction they set up against the
motion of the planets would be sufficient to
retard them as well as the other heavenly
bodies and they would have stopped moving
aeons ago the mere fact that outer space
is such a good vacuum is the reason that
the heavenly bodies will go on circling in
their orbits for millions and billions of years
without being impeded in their flight

furthermore we know what happens when
a meteor strikes the upper reaches of our
atmosphere which in itself is a fairly good
vacuum but not a hard one the meteor
is almost immediately consumed by the ter-
rific friction set up now the earth as well



as other heavenly bodies move as fast or
faster than the average meteor and if they
did not move in such a perfect vacuum they
would be consumed in short order by the
terrific friction if their motion was not
slowed down before

of course to the human being the idea
of the vacuum may be appalling because we
cannot picture ourselves living in anything
but air we are in this respect much like a
fish who deprived of his water will soon
asphyxiate so if we ever visit outer space
we must provide ourselves with our own at-
mosphere and wear air-proof helmets and
clothes otherwise we would not only suf-
focate but suffer much worse dangers

the human body at sea level is constant-
ly subject to an atmospheric pressure which
amounts to  pounds per square inch we
are like deep-sea fish who at the bottom of
the ocean are constantly subject to a terrific
pressure balloonists who have ascended to
the highest part of the atmosphere that
could be reached which is only a trifling
 feet are always troubled by nose
bleeds and blood spurting from underneath
their finger nails if the same balloonists
could ascent only a mere twenty miles above
the surface of the earth they would almost
explode because the skin no longer subject
to the atmospheric pressure would probably
burst open and the blood working internally
at a high pressure would in addition flow
from all the human orifices this provided
always that there is a measure of heat

a number of science fiction authors have
mentioned the dangers of a lack of pressure
on the human body in their writings and
stressed the point that human beings would
summarily explode if ejected from a space
flyer into open space

this idea is open to some controversy for
the writers have left the terrific cold en-
countered in open space out of their calcu-
lations it is my opinion that if you eject
a human being without protection from a
space flyer he will not have sufficient time
to explode because he will probably be froz-
en solid instantaneously at best the effects
of the lack of pressure such as the blood
squirting from the skin and orifices will
not get very- far before the body is frozen
solid by the absolute lack of heat the body
temperature shooting down perpendicularly
to nearly absolute zero or minus  degrees
centigrade
the satellite

of doom d d sharp

the drawn face of the old man pressed against the glass there seem-
 i to be a hopeless bravery in the haggard features


while a world waited breathlessly the satellite went
on and on repeating its circles of doom

chapter i

just before they reached the front steps
professor mullin stopped and touched
clifford on the arm

there is one man you must watch
who clifford asked still occupied
with the crisis ahead of him

briggs rothberg calls him bb but he
isnt an air gun charge at all he is buck-
shot with a full charge of smokeless powder
behind him

just what do you mean clifford asked
with interest awakened

briggs is a keen chemist maker of mod-
els for rothbergs would-be inventors he
is police commissioner with a strong po-
litical influence and he is the husband of
rothbergs only daughter ambitious and
dangerous dont let him know how much
mjney rothberg is thinking of putting into
your scheme

what does he look like

tall and unforgetable not much of a
description eh

well i dont know about that there
arent many men who are unforgetable as
far as personal appearance is concerned
briggs is hed impress the most phleg-
matic a deep growl large protruding black
eyes overscored with crow feathers he
drops into these meetings sometimes i
hope he doesnt come in tonight but if he
does ramble off on some unimportant de-
tail he might queer your whole plan
would rothberg allow him to interfere
no rothberg doesnt take dictation
from anybody but briggs is buckshot re-
member that and i believe he suspects
whats up

they mounted the steps and followed a
footman to a long room down the center
of which ran a polished table

cliffords zero hour was at hand he
knew by reputation every man around that
table they were all outstanding men in
their particular fields of science directly
in front of him sat j g reed who had more
than once startled the world with ideas
of matter and space next was played who



experimented with rockets stortz the as-
tronomer who had at last proved the ro-
tation of venus gertz the electrical wizard
guriy who had explained the apparent
discrepancy in the ratio of gravitation be-
tween mercury and the sun ralls who had
taken the new tidal theory of the forma-
tion of the earth and blown it to smither-
eens phil lips who had set forth a compli-
cated thesis which had grown out of ein-
steins relativity and a half dozen others
at the head of the table was of course old
jacob rothberg who with the magnet of
his money and personality had assembled
these filings from the fields of science

clifford caught the pale eyes of professor
charles of rothberg university appraising
him he felt a personal antipathy in that
cold passionless stare and it upset lm so
he barely heard ihe opening of rothbeigs
address even as he heard rolhheig call-
ing upon him to explain his plan he re-
tained the uneasy sensation that the pro-
fessor was coolly dissecting him

he shook oft the uncomfortable feeling
as he rose and the double row of white
faces about the table turned toward him
his big moment was at hand he started
speaking looking straight at ralls for
ralls flourished upon his reputation as an
iconoclast and would of course maintain
his position as a breaker of idols und a
destroyer of dreams ralls lean features
were ravenously alert as clifford began

gentlemen my proposal is to launch
a ship just beyond the atmosphere so that
it will form a satellite of the earth it
would need no refueling and no additional
power except that required to send cargo
to and from the ship

back of ralls a door opened and
through it a man glided cautiously
slopped and closed the door behind him

undoubtedly it was briggs the mans
whole appearance was strange and unfor-
getable

clifford hesitated and then decided to go
ahead and pay briggs no attention but he
did not have an opportunity professor


wonder stories

charles rose placed the tips of his long
white fingers spiderlike upon the manu-
script below him and cleared his stringy
looking throat

clifford was taken aback at the double
interruption and folded his arms and waited
calmly for what the psychologist had to
say

mr peterson professor charles
whined in a high fine
voice how do you
kow or we know
that it is possible to
project a ship beyond
the field of gravity of
our earth

sure briggs
growled in that deep
bass of his thats
the berries all he
wants is to spend some
of the governors mon-
ey

rothberg hitched
about in his chair to
face his son-in-law
but the hard stare in
the penetrating old
eyes brought only a
stubborn resistance

rothberg signaled un-
mistakably for briggs
to leave the room and
fire flashed between
the two as briggs
leaned casually against
the marble wainscoat-
ing and extracted a
cork-tipped cigarette
and stuck it between
his lips

rothberg half rose
from his chair and
roared bb you get
out

briggs drew himself erect his cheeks flam-
ing then he sent a long cloud of defiant
smoke in rothbergs direction shrugged his
shoulders and growled in his bearlike bass

all right governor

then he left the room

clifford turned his attention back to pro-
fessor charles and continued

of course it is impossible to fire any pro-
jectile totally beyond the earths gravity
newton has shown that each body in space
is attracted to every other according to their
masses and the inverse ratio of the square
of their distances

so so the professor coughed slightly
then took his glasses
from his nose and
held them as a pointer
in cliffords direction
as he continued

but one can not
get around the fact
that you would have
to send your ship far
enough from the earth
to enter into cosmic
space if it is to float
continually without
falling how do you
know that you can
project anything that
far how do you
know how far that
is

clifford tried to be
patient but it was
quite evident that
however eminent pro-
fessor charles was in
his own line he knew
very little of astrono-
my

bodies do not float
in space clifford be-
gan they are pulled
toward each other
what keeps them from
flying together in a
huge mass is their vel-
ocity which is much
greater than that of a
highpowered rifle bullet as it leaves the
gun they move with hurricanes of speed
which would belittle cyclones it is this
that overcomes the pull of gravitation

he reached into his pocket and extracted
a small rubbber ball which was attached
to a rubber string

vo idea more startling
 in the history of our
earth has been proposed
than that put forward by
hermann oberth the ger-
man rocket expert by
sending a rocket aloft some
four or five hundred miles
above the earth and giving
it a speed of about  miles
ot secondherr oberth states
the rocket will circle the
earth until eternity without
further expenditure of
power a terrific idea
filled with the most stu-
pendous possibilities for
the people of the earth it
may revolutionize transpor-
tation or warfare it may
even change the whole
course f out lives

but although it is an idea
filled with the most dra-
matic and adventurous sug-
gestions mr sharp does
not want to deal with them
fantastically he has writ-
ten instead a story of in-
tense realism sticking close
to life and truth with
characters that live and
breathe and so he has
made this story as vivid
and understandable as is
humanly possible	
the satellite of doom



you will notice when this little ball ia
idle it hangs toward the earth

he began to whirl the ball around and
aiound and it went humming over his head

when enough speed is attained gravity
is overcome and the ball rises into the air
to make the illustration plain let the
string be the pull of gravity and my thumb
be the sun

he whirled the ball faster the rubber
string stretched as he went on

when the speed of the ball increases
the orbit increases it stretched the pull of
thf rubber gravity when the speed de-
creases the orbit narrows this illustrates
simply the forces which hold every body
in space to its proper
place

any body moving
around the sun with a
speed less than 
miles per second must
have an orbit smaller
than that of the earth
and one having more
than  miles per
second would have a
larger orbit than that
of the earth while one
with a velocity of ex-
ceeding  miles per
second would fly away
from the sun for good

now suppose we
fire a ship from the
earth so that its speed is  miles per sec-
ond at that velocity it should pace the
earth forever and apparently move across
the earths surface from east to west as the
earth turns on its axis that ship should
make one trip about the earth every twenty-
four hours

a gigantic plan

he paused and let the little rubber ball
hang idly from its string as he glanced
at the studious faces regarding him then
his glance went back to ralls who had
leaned forward elbows upon the table chin
wrinkled into the palms of his big hands

fingers working upon his lean cheeks he
was smiling tolerantly and yet there was
something belittling in the expression of
his eyes he impressed clifford as a strong
man who had braced himself to wrestle with
an iron weight and just discovered it waa
cork

your illustration is interesting but your
astronomy is faulty ralls drawled with
rather a bored air everything upon this
earth is moving around the sun at a velocity
of  miles per second a ship placed
just outside the earths atmosphere and giv-
en that velocity and no other would fall at
once

clifford saw his mistake certainly the
ship would fall and
the flaw in his theory
rattled him for a mo-
ment so that he was
unable to correct hia
error while he strove
for poise the bulky
rather awkward form
of stortz hitched about
and the big-faced as-
tronomer smiled en-
couragingly clifford
felt a rescue at hand

mister ralls
stortz drawled in slow
rumbling accents
our young friend ia
not so very much in
error his mistake is
starting with the wrong objects it is not
the gravity of the sun the ship must over-
come for that is already overcome through
the inertia of the earth our problem is
the law of small bodies moving around
large bodies fortunately this simplifies
rather than complicates the question the
ship need not be fired with a velocity of
 miles per second to form a satellite
of the earth but with a speed of only 
miles per second

while i dont want to lend my opinion
as yet for or against this young mans pro-
posal i will state that oberth a german
scientist has given considerable study to
the question of rocket ships and he claim

d d sharp


wonder stories

that he can develop a vehicle which will
fly from europe to america in thirty min-
utes and he believes it possible to build
a space ship which will travel at a velocity
of about seven miles per second almost
double that required by the ship proposed

i might add that professor r h god-
dard the american expert has made a pow-
der rocket which ejected gases of 
feet per second and opel claims to have
invented a liquid three times as powerful
as any powdered fuel so our goal may not
be so far off after all

ralls pursed his lips then he turned on
clifford

all right be snapped grant that
your space ship can be shot with enough
velocity to continuously circle the earth
how are you going to get your freight
aboard even should you contrive to get
the packages up there dont you know that
inertia would carry them on in orbits of
their own without your ship

my plan is to have a system of rockets
at each city under the path of the satellite
these rockets would have compartments for
storing mail and express and would be
timed to be fired at the exact fraction of a
second to make contact with the ship

what is the need of a ship ralls in-
terrupted the rockets would circle the
earth of their own speed

with no ship clifford answered the
packages could never be brought down at
all the purpose of the ship is to provide a
buttress against which a timed discharge
in the end of the rocket can be set off to
kick loose the rocket at its destination
the ship you understand is not to be a
container in the sense of an empty hull it
is to be a steel cylinder against which the
rocket can be shot these rockets will have
clocks timed for the discharge of their gas-
es and the rockets will be strongly magnet-
ized which will assist them in making con-
tact with the ship and will hold them firmly
in place until the reverse discharge takes
place the rockets are also to be equipped
with folding helicopters which will au-
tomatically extend and break the return fall
so as to prevent injury to the rockets or

chapter ii
rothberg speaks out

he paused again for his words seemed
falling on a cast iron personality
ralls was shaking his woolly head and
cliffords heart sank as he saw affirmation
of ralls position in the faces of at least
three of the scientists about the table he
hoped that stortz would come again to his
rescue but the old astronomer while still
regarding him kindly seemed lost in
thought his glance caught rothberg who
had been sitting silently erect at the head
of the table his whole manner seemed
suddenly changed his eyes were sparkl-
ing and alive and he jabbed at a button be-
side his chair

a girl came through a small door at the
right clifford first took her to be roth-
bergs daughter then he saw a stenograph-
ers notebook and pencil and he decided
she was a secretary held overtime for this
meeting

she was neat rather stylishly yet quiet-
ly dressed except for a dash of color at
her neck and sleeves and an orange sash
caught about her slim waist she look a
small chair which rothberg himself dragged
toward her and then opened her book giv-
ing the men about the table no more than
a quick glance

at the time she did not impress clifford
as being more than an ordinary pretty sten-
ographer he was not at all interested in
her but in what rothberg was about to
dictate

crystal rothberg began quickly with
a curtness in his tone left over from his
conflict with briggs please take down
these notes and ask robinson to look over
them with view of formulating a contract

mr rothberg professor charles was
on his feet

rothberg glanced up and scowled

what is it professor

again professor charles had his glasses
between thumb and forefinger pointing
them this time at rothberg

have you taken into consideration the
the satellite of doom



likelihood of a condition of neurosis in the
applicant

rothberg rose from his chair and stepped
to one side of it professor charles sat
down leaving his sentence incomplete but
still pointed his glasses as though holding
them ready for instant use rothberg smiled
tolerantly and clifford knew the objection
had fallen as lightly as dust

you sound too much like freud roth-
berg drawled we are not dealing with
psycho-analysis but mechanical and cos-
mic laws

he turned and faced the whole attentive
board his eyes lost their twinkle and his
lips forgot to smile instead there seemed
to be a fire of inspiration growing slowly
idealism lifting the materialist above him-
self

gentlemen he began very quietly
this is one proposal  am going to take
on without waiting for you to fit every
angle and line into place and pronounce

q e d

from that point on to the close of his
speech his eyes burned more and more
brightly and his voice became more ear-
nest

most men he concluded desire to
create something which can be left to on-
coming generations with the mark of their
individuality upon it one may conclude
this is all vanity but i believe every great
work which preserves the marks of genius
sets a standard for future generations which
it defies them to excel

sitting there listening to talk of cosmic
law it has occurred to me that this young
mans dream may be used to leave an im-
perishable remembrance of us who live
today once upon a time a pharaoh hop-
ing for immortality raised the great pyr-
amid of gizeh but lasting as that is it
shall in time perish so too shall all the
light fabric of our own civilization but
the ships we launch into space shall never
decay they will speed on and on a last-
ing inspiration to generations yet unborn

lifford caught the fire of rothbergs
idealism and mixed it with the flame of
his own dream but a damper was thrown

upon it immediately for briggs thrust his
thin inquisitive face through the door gave
one keeu searching look about and re-
treated but before his face disappeared
clifford saw a glaring threat turned upon
the girl who looked up just in time to catch
it she shrank from those black eyes and
clifford watched her rather than briggs
it seemed that she was fighting to show no
fear but her tightly drawn underlip be-
trayed her	

when clifford looked again toward the
door briggs had gone he wondered what
the man meant and rothberg added import-
ance to the incident by getting upset over
it before that he had seemed aloof as
though he was in a world unaffected by
men and their petty ideas but now he
searched every face as though worried
whether they had penetrated a secret of the
family closet when his eyes rested on clif-
ford they resumed some of the old fire and
zeal he had shown while making his short
speech he turned quickly and spoke in a
low tone to the girl she gathered up her
notebook and some papers and left the
room 

professor mullin caught cliffords hand
when they were again outside the hall

i knew youd win my boy i knew it
but i must admit i never suspected old
rothberg had such a touch of sentiment in
his makeup

heres the car he added as rothbergs
limousine drew to the curb

clifford pulled himself from his reveries
and tried to keep up his part of the conver-
sation he was very grateful for professor
mullins help had it not been for him very
likely he would still be working back of a
glass covered desk at thirty-five dollars per
week dreaming of space ships that should
never be launched yet he had not a word
to say his thoughts seemed bound to that
hall with its long polished table and a smart
looking girl trying to appear composed un-
der the threat of a tall black-eyed man one
never forgot

and that night he went to bed not en-
tirely happy he was worried for fear that
briggs wouid do something to upset his
plans three days later however he felt


wonder stories

more secure about the venture for he met
rothberg and his attorneys down town and
the contracts were actually signed and the
work put under way

only once in the three months that fol-
lowed did he see the girl and that was a
chance meeting in the hall of rothbergs
home she smiled and bowed her head
slightly her gray eyes friendly and then
she was gone

the end of those three months found the
ship almost complete and the time drew
near for her tryout the morning he got
this news clifford went down to lunch so
absorbed in a letter from rothberg which
gave him the details that he hardly heard
die blatant cries of newsboys in the streets
nor did he make out the meaning of them
until a small fellow with big blue eyes
thrust a paper under his nose and shouted

extra mister extra big banker dis-
appears

clifford took one and idly glanced down
at the picture rothberg hardly under-
standing what the picture was about he
glanced at the headlines

some of the import of those words seeped
into his shocked brain as he stared down
unable to read on then a dull hurt pos-
sessed him he thought of how well he had
grown to like the millionaire in the short
lime he had been associated with him then
it came to him that this meant the upsetting
of every tiling connected with launching the
ship briggs flashed into his mind if the
space ship being almost ready to launch had
anything to do with the time of rothbergs
disappearance briggs might be back of it

the boy nudged him five cents mis-
ter

clifford pulled a coin from his pocket
and dropped it into the stubby palm the
boy ran on shouting extra extra big
banker disappears

for a long time clifford stood there
stunned his house of cards had tumbled
about him his dream was only a dream
after all his plan only a scheme the new
light in his life was not a beacon at the
port of success but just a flare of illusion
somewhere across the strange darkness of
failure

not for a second did he have any faith
in briggs going ahead with the work
briggs wasnt the kind to spend a great sum
of money helping other men attain their
dreams and his hand seemed all too plain
in this clifford knew rothberg had made
provision for carrying on this work in case
of his death but since he had only disap-
peared the delay in the work would prob-
ably be dragged out indefinitely that
would be like briggs

a strange call

for a long time he stood letting his
thoughts wander on and on men and
women flowed past in an endless procession
propelled back and forth through the heart
of the city cars honked beyond the curb
traffic congested and moved again as the
bell rang and the lights changed no one
paid him the least attention he who had
been so sure a few minutes before that this
strange restless congested mass of human
beings should know him and acclaim him

now he was one of them again an un-
known in a mass of unknowns just a cor-
puscle in the veins of the city he felt he
would never reach the heights of his as-
piration never see his rockets flaring against
the heavens he must plod lift and place
lift and place again eight hours a day six
days each week fifty-two weeks each year
until some day another mannikin would he
put in his place to carry on the unending
drudgery of life

the paper dropped from his fingers a
puff of wind caught twisted it and whisked
it aloft high above the heads of the indus-
trious mass then let it fall into the streets
where it scudded along under the shuffling
feet of the unseeing horde it lay there
restless with each new gust shaken but un-
able to rise again

staring at that paper with its warrant
against his dreams he remembered freud
and the psychology of grandeur and dreams
like a good many other men of imagina-
tion he had believed in his luck in his al-
lotment to play a major part in the scheme
of things felt somehow that he was a
man born to walk among the mighty
the satellite of doom



he shrugged his shoulders in an attempt
to be resigned

rothberg disappears up and down
the street newsboys cried his doom cried it
lustily with a trill of elation for the pennies
they were getting big banker disap-
pears

pennies pennies for lollypops or tops
or what did it matter the big news they
had not at all

he turned back and unlocked the door
crossed his room and caught his image in
the mirror he was astonished at the ap-
parent change in himself the evidence of
defeat in his features whipped him to a
new determination he would fight on
he drew his shoulders erect and grinned
the wrinkles caused by the laugh looked
odd against his ashy face he sat down
upon his bed

thoughts chased each other around in
endless procession the hands of the tiny
clock upon the table crawled around the di-
al the telephone bell against the wall
tinkled now that he noticed it he believed
it had been ringing a long time he lifted
the receiver and answered in a voice that
was thin and hollow

mr peterson a girl asked

yes who are you

you dont know me by name i took
the notes for the conference the night your
plan was adopted

yes yes certainly i remember you

please come out here just as soon as
you can everything depends on it

all right im coming clifford an-
swered wondering at the calmness of his
voice are you at the rothberg place

there was no answer

he fumbled in the directory for roth-
bergs phone and found it was not listed
for the life of him he could not remember
the number he asked information but she
refused to give it to him

uneasiness grew the more he was balked
but there was nothing he could do only
hurry as fast as possible to the rothberg
place

he caught the elevator rushed into the
street to hail a taxi

crowds were swarming about the walls

which enclosed the estate when the taxi
drew up at the curb beyond the walls all
seemed quiet enough and there was little
to indicate possible tragedy except two
stolid men in uniform at each side of the
front steps and a few brisk men entering
and departing

just as he left the cab briggs came down
the walk

the  ery man i wanted to see his big
booming voice stopping any attempt to
evade him

briggs was die last man clifford want-
ed to see but he followed him into the
house in the board room briggs closed
the door and turned on him

of course youve heard

yes clifford admitted watching him
intently

the old man must have known he was
in danger briggs went on yesterday he
asked me to carry on this work should any-
thing happen to him tom me he wanted
the ship to be a monument to him

yes clifford assented absently think-
ing of this new puzzle why was briggs
telling him this was he really going ahead
and launch the ship if so that indicated
he must have nothing at all to do with
rothbergs disappearance then who did

as he stood thoughtfully wondering
about the new phase of the situation briggs
turned on him aggressively

peterson youve no business out here
i want you to let this affair alone

all right clifford agreed coolly i
will when i find what became of mr roth-
berg

better not meddle briggs growled
after all your ship is all that interests

you

i dont like your tone briggs clifford
said

youll like it a sight less if you meddle
here

im not meddling clifford answered
becoming more irritated i had a reason
to come here

yeah  know she phoned you im
onto her game too now you get this

----a


wonder stories

straight if you love your life you stay
out of this

is that a threat

that or a promise take it as you
choose

briggs hunched his shoulders and doubled
his fists clifford didnt want to have a
knock-down fight in the mans own home
so he turned his back and strode from the
room he smiled a little his sense of hu-
mor saving the situation surely briggs
ought to know he was no match for him
that way

get out then briggs called angrily
and keep away from crystal when i want
you ill get you remember that

clifford went into the hall wondering at
briggs jealousy over the girl she did not
appear to be the type who would put her-
self into briggs power nor one who would
carry on an affair with him

in the hall he found her waiting for him
and a big load of worry left his mind

the tragedy in the house seemed to make
her more reserved there was a touch of
somberness in her dark coat suit and clif-
ford missed the flashes of color she had
worn at her neck and waist he wondered
if this overtone of black was her usual
business habit or if it hinted that she be-
lieved rothberg dead

she did not smile though there was an
evident relief in her face when she saw him
im so glad you came she said

i hurried he answered taking her hand
you hung up so abruptly i was really
worried

lets talk in my little office she inter-
rupted quickly

wherever you wish he agreed

he followed down the hall and found
himself in a small room fitted with steno-
graphers desk a filing cabinet and two
chairs she seated herself at the desk and
he sank into the other chair which was
evidently the one rothberg used while dic-
tating

im not the regular secretary she said
briefly but i do most of bis personal let-
ters he can trust me better than anyone
else

chapter iii

a dangerous situation

clifford noticed that she did not call
rothbergs name evidently it would
have been a task for her to mention it just
then certainly he and she were very close
to each other w ell roll berg had excel-
lent taste and he did not blame him for
hiring her he did wonder though just
how much she cared for die millionaire and
how much for his money then he put that
thought from his mind he felt it was un-
just to her whatever her connection with
the banker he felt it must be sincere and
unaffected by his wealth

about the phone she reminded him
that was queer your voice was cut off
like something or someone had cut the
wire i tried to get central again and she
would not answer then i went upstairs
and that phone was dead too

arent there other phones about the
place

yes one in bbs laboratory and one in
the servants quarters

did you try either of them

no- she hesitated truth is i didnt
want the servants to know i started down
to bbs laboratory and something seemed
to hold me back i dont like to acknowl-
edge it really its silly but something
seemed to warn me to stay out of there i
dont know why i felt like that maybe it
was because bb acts so queer of late
clifford got out of his chair ill go
down and find whats wrong

no she cried you must not
why he asked hesitating

bb hell do anything now he even
puts his own guards at my door

mr rothberg will rip him inside out
when he conies back

oh i do wish hed come back  am ter-
ribly worried about him

no one would dare harm him clif-
ford assured her though he was not quite
so sure himself he is probably kidnapped
to delay launching the ship

maybe that is all but bb acts so
strange he dares things he never dared
the satellite of doom

 

before he threatens me in a way which
makes me really afraid

you think-briggs killed him

she winced paled slightly and then said
bb resented the outlay from that first
night last night when they were together
in here he told bb he would spend his en-
tire fortune or make a go of the satellites
bb agreed with him but too readily i
know now i should have done something
she stopped talking and her head bent
forward to hide her face it was plain she
was losing her magnificent control but af-
ter a moment she went on that was the
last time anyone saw him they went down
into the laboratory to look over the ship
this morning the butler told the police
that he had seen him go into the street
about nine oclock last night but i believe
he is lying

have you told anyone what you sus-
pect

there was no one i could trust

if the butler is lying mr rothberg must
still be down in the laboratory

yes somewhere down there

then why was he not found he ex-
claimed

you dont know bb she said with a
pronounced agitation he has drugs and
chemicals which will do unbelievable
things

i dont like to leave you alone he said
with evident concern as he got out of his
chair but mr rothberg may need help
ill be right back

dont go down there alone she warned
and lowered her voice as though she sus-
pected someone was listening not the lab-
oratory youd be at his mercy

her concern thrilled him he let his
eyes linger on her watched her black
pupils grow wider and wider puzzled at
the way he affected her and then with some
chagrin he saw that her eyes were not upon
him but that she was looking over his shoul-
der at something behind him that her eyes
were not widening with love but with ter-
ror

he whirled about quickly and found
briggs peering through the partly opened

door clifford gave him one disdainful
glance and deliberately turned his back
the girl pulled at the hem of her short
skirt and toyed carelessly with a paper cut-
ter

clifford was sorry for her briggs was
using his position in the home to act a
beast

i hear the ship is ready to launch
clifford said the first thing that came into
his mind anything to divert briggs from
the girl

tomorrow briggs declared and his
tone was defiant as though he expected clif-
ford to object

dont we wait for rothberg clifford
demanded

briggs stepped forward until he towered
over clifford who leaned upon the desk

tomorrow i said he snarled not a
day later

then it is ready clifford asked his
nerves tightening may i see it briggs

briggs regarded him with an uncertain
suspicion then seemed to arrive at a deci-
sion and turned toward the door

come on he growled

clifford followed but felt the girls hand
upon his sleeve

briggs whirled and there was a danger-
ous fire in his eyes

get on clifford commanded briggs
shot a threat over his shoulder and then
went striding down the hall

jn all the months that clifford had
worked with rothberg and briggs correct-
ing flaws and inventing schemes for im-
proving the ship he had been refused a
glimpse of the work briggs had insisted
on keeping him out of the laboratory and
his whole knowledge of the ships progress
was obtained from blue prints and small
models so when briggs opened the door of
the shop and went down a short flight of
stairs clifford peered eagerly over the maze
of pipes machinery and belts to rest upon
the ship which was near the rear of the
building

she was indeed an engaging vessel night
was just settling and the soft radiance of
her luminous paint glowed against the
shadowed walls clifford knew then why


wonder stories

rothberg had planned to send her out at
night she would make a spectacular de-
parture

- all loaded and ready for contact
briggs rumbled as he pressed a button

the wall beyond seemed to resolve itself
into great doors which slid open to provide
a hole large enough for the exit of the two-
hundred foot torpedo-shaped ship new
track gleamed below the ship and ran out
into the trial yard

well make ihe experiment here the
first the world shall know of it will be the
flash of light as it shoots across the heavens
to circle the earth 

i hope it does briggs it would ruin
me should it fall

you said it couldnt briggs exclaimed
hoarsely and stared at him in astonish-
ment

thats my theory briggs only the ex-
periment will tell for sure

it mustnt briggs raved his whole at-
titude showing unparalleled concern i
wont fire it if its likely to fail ill have
her dragged to the river and sunk first

trapped

t didnt mean to intimate that we would
a fail briggs of course we wont give
up even if this one doesnt take off in that
case we would have to tear her up and find
what was wrong then try again

no briggs declared staring at the
floor ill have her drowned wed be the
laughing stock of the whole world

he jabbed at the switch and ihe doors
closed he turned and gave clifford a
quick searching look crafty with some hid-
den anxiety

peterson he finally said youve a fu-
ture ahead of you you have already de-
vised some things which should make you
famous when they are widely known

he lowered his voice and gave a cautious
glance around the dimly lighted room

clifford was annoyed why was the man
whispering there seemed to be no one
down there to hear him even had he shout-
ed

ive made a discovery or two myself

briggs went on something deep some-
thing which has to do with the basic laws
of life

no

sure

clifford was instantly alert here seemed
to be a chance to get briggs to talk he
was anxious to find out how sane the blaz-
ing-eyed chemist was

what have you discovered he asked
shhh not so loud its a secret i have-
nt even told the governor not a soul
but ill tell you 

clifford stiffened expectantly and after
a moment briggs went on

of course youll admit that life is no
more than chemical action

no i dont clifford objected mainly
to draw him out

you dont know that briggs ques-
tioned fretfully

oh ill admit the physical part of life
is chemical clifford said soothingly watch-
ing briggs closely but there is more to
life than the oxidation which takes place
in the body what about intelligence spi-
rit if you please we chemists can make a
particle of matter wiggle whistle sing and
even talk but we have never made it feel
or think

of course briggs drawled absently
but it is the chemical part of life i am
experimenting with

the glitter in his black eyes was now
more metallic i have discovered how to
produce flesh live flesh peterson

clifford clenched his hands and stared
at the cement floor he could not trust
himself to look at briggs a moment longer
he fell sure then that he was on the trail
of rothberg dead or alive

briggs droned on in my vault i have
something that will interest you made of
minerals and treated with chemicals flesh
human flesh and it bleeds

clifford had  doubt by that time that
briggs was entirely mad and that he had
either killed rothberg outright or was us-
ing him for some horrible experiment he
did not know whether to answer or remain
silent one bit too much interest might
scare briggs and one bit less might stop
the satellite of doom



the wild ramblings briggs hesitated and
clifford said youre a wizard if you can
do that

he wondered if briggs noticed the strain
in his voice

ive done it briggs flared

science asks proof

you want to see it the crafty anxiety
was growing in the black eyes come on
ill give you a look

briggs strode off down a lane between the
machinery and clifford followed him close-
ly hoping that he would find rothberg
alive

they reached a large vault of masonry
and steel briggs swung open the door and
stepped inside clifford close at his heels
briggs turned on an electric light

there he cackled pointing to a glass
case at the far end of the ten-foot vault

clifford gasped

in the long glass case was something
which might have been a man it was nude
terribly bloodsoaked and lacerated

rothberg with two quick strides he
reached the case and peered in the
body proved to be nothing more than a
mannikin of flesh-colored rubber daubed
here and there with red paint he whirled
around sensing a trap briggs was gone
and the big steel door of the vault was
closing briggs had been too keen for
him

he stepped back and regarded the gray
steel bolts of the door as they glistened un-
der the light he knew the strength of that
chrome steel the inch thick tusks were
shot solidly into the frame and there was
no way on earth he could drive them back

he was chagrined at how easily he had
been duped even with the warning the girl
had given him truth was he had not be-
lieved briggs was quite so diabolical and
vicious as she seemed to think now it
proved she had been quite right and he was
too late in realizing it

hardly hoping for any means of escape
he searched around the small room there
was a lot of chemical apparatus on the ta-
ble and the walls were lined with steel
shelves fitted with filing boxes

clifford pulled down one of the files
it was heavy he opened it inside were
typewritten manuscripts and blue prints
scientific stuff the records of experiments
which rothberg had financed

no doubt the records of his own scheme
were here and he went carefully through the
file hoping to find them and get them away
from briggs should he by any chance leave
the vault alive

the first file finished he took down an-
other and as he searched he stacked the
boxes carefully upon the floor back of
the eighth box was a small round hole in
the masonry of the wall he was complete-
ly surprised at finding it

mice certainly not

he stepped upon one of the steel boxes
to peer closer and saw that the hole was the
end of a galvanized pipe cut flush with the
surface of the wall

that was queer why should a pipe be
run into this vault and hidden behind the
filing boxes

wondering about it he rummaged through
the papers in the ninth box and started on
the tenth

he smelled gas instantly he knew his
peril this was briggs way of getting rid
of him  it was also probably the way roth-
berg had been dispatched

the gas fumes hissed through the pipe
it would not take long to finish him at that
rate he took out his handkerchief to plug
the hole but that would never do he
knew briggs well enough to know that plug-
ging the hole would not beat him briggs
would take no chances with any escape as
simple as that in whatever room he had
his gas lever would be a meter that would
gauge the amount of gas entering the vault
should he plug the hole briggs would be
warned and leave him to starve or would
devise some other way to finish him

clifford knew if he were to get out alive
he would have to do better than just plug
the pipe he would have to let gas flow
into the vault let briggs believe he was
suffocated and then surprise him as he
opened the door to drag out his body but
how already he vas dizzy with the fumes

there was a way and he thought of it
s

wonder stories

a desperate method which gave small hope
but he was in a desperate situation

he struck a match and threw it at the
hole the gas burst into flame leaping far
into the vault and singeing his hair then
it shrank to the pipe and burned in a long
tongue of roaring fire on and on it burned
the acrid fumes became less pungent but
the air of the vault grew hot and stifling

he stood helplessly and stared at the
hissing blaze and tried to devise some way
to prevent its eating up the air he needed
for his gasping lungs

chapter iv
into the sky

rie vault became hotter and hotter he
suffocated his throat seemed parched
with fire he decided it would be better to
die by cool gas than by blazing fire he
groped about the vault searching dizzily
for something with which to smother the
flame and as he searched be remembered
his coming hour of triumph but one day
ahead god how he wanted to live long
enough to launch the ship to watch il race
out into the orbit of its service to the earth
he wanted to protect that strange girl up-
stairs-he wanted-he wanted-what air
-just air

he reeled sank to the floor the llame
above burned on riding high about the
mouth of the pipe higher and higher as
though it were breaking loose from its an-
chor and trying to float away up and down
il crept as it fed on stagnant air currents
from the floor and clifford knew what
made it ride away from the pipe the oxy-
gen in the air was growing thin

black night and red flame played hide
and seek across his brain he felt that he
was slipping down down down into a deep
dark place lighted now and then with red
flares of light sprawled upon the floor he
breathed in a quick pant like a huge lizard
spread upon a jungle floor

cliflord was not entirely out when there
came a noise as of someone working at the
door the steel tusks moved back from
their sockets and the door moved it opened

wider and a flood of fresh sweet air poured
in he breathed greedily and tried to get
hold of himself he felt sure briggs would
be armed and try to finish him he rose
groggily to his knees and doubled his lean
fists waiting like a cornered beast

a swift figure darted through the half
open door seized his shoulders and tugged
at him he waved his fists groggily in an
effort to strike he heard a faint cry of
pain and the blackness seemed lo lifl again

the girl was there somehow she had
found him he marvelled at her courage
knowing how very much afraid she was to
be down there he marvelled still more at
her concern for him

the fresh air braced him like aromatic
spirits he got to his feet and leaned
against the wall she stepped nearer her
gray eyes burning with anxiety he smiled
weakly

dont worry im all right he assured
her

i knew hed try to kill you thats why
i begged you not to come down here

yes i am dumb but you rescued me
he said with a bil of chagrin

not so dumb she denied

he glanced up to see her eyes regarding
the flaming jet the fire trembled in the
mirror of her eyes

you outwitted him that time but lets
yet out of here she added nervously
hell want nothing better than to lock us
both in

shall i help you she asked leaning
over him

no ill make it go ahead

she left the vault and he followed reel-
ing a trifle outside she slipped around a
black panel which held electrical switches
and then across toward the space ship
which glowed with a weird radiance against
the dark lifeless room here and there a
night bulb cast grotesque shadows of the
queer machines upon the concrete floor and
distorted them against the pale gray walls

hell be wild she whispered

hell never launch the ship now he
said dejectedly
the satellite of doom



launch it yourself she declared its
all ready

mr rothberg he questioned

her enthusiasm died she stood silent
for a moment and then in a sad soft tone
im sure hed want you to i am sure
of it

youre right he agreed why wait
when the test can he made now io you
know the switches which work the hoist

yes she said and pressed the button
which opened the big doors

they slid back and unfolded a section
of clear moonless sky alight with the
thousand candles of night she stepped to
a row of levers against the wall

contact she called like a valiant lit-
tle soldier

the hoist growled the ship slid out-
ivard and up along the inclined track until
it was high up in the yard outside the labor-
atory she pressed another switch and the
cable fell away another and there was a
burst of flashing spluttering roaring flame
which howled like a mighty cyclone of
chemical disintegration

the ship heaved upward with constantly
accelerating velocity it went streaking
across the sky with a long tail of fire left
for an instant in its wake on and on the
monster sped faster faster it grew
smaller and smaller into the vastness of the
heavens

cries came from the streets shouts
yells questions tossed back and forth
man to man the space ship was setting
the city on its ears

it gained the heavens glowing like a big
star it sped across the zenith against a
galaxy of ancient stars moving down to-
ward the rim of the far horizon

clifford and the girl stood dumb hum-
bled with the power man had brought at
last into his control dumb with the great-
ness of having created something far more
lasting than themselves

behind them came the sound of running
feet

clifford turned to see briggs who began
to shout wildly

believing the man was entirely mad he

reached about for some weapon but
briggs paid little attention to him

good god he was at last understand-
able what have you done the gover-
nors in there

the girl screamed no no no she
swayed and sank upon the floor and hud-
dled there as though strength had gone en-
tirely out of her

clifford leaned over and laid his arm
across her shoulders and felt the quiver of
of her body as she shook with grief

im sorry so sorry was all he could
think to say

briggs hurdled back through the labor-
atory crying

weve got to stop it weve got to stop
it the governors in there

clifford knew how useless was that cry
that ship was like death one could launch
it but there was no known way to bring it
down it was in the control of the cos-
mos

what have  done oh what have i
done the girl sobbed brokkenly

we didnt know clifford said we
had no way of knowing you and i are not
to blame it was briggs the scoundrel
his words seemed to shake her with new
despair

oh you dont understand you dont
know i am bbs wife

clifford straightened with the shock

she-bbs wife rothbergs daughter
why had he not guessed it

chapter v

briggs story

lifford had no doubt bb spoke the
truth rothberg must certainly be in
the steel satellite of course they must
make a desperate effort to get him out-no
expense or peril would be spared but un-
less briggs had provided some means for
him to live up there only the frozen body
would be their reward if they succeeded
at all hundreds of miles above the earth
the ship was as unattainable as though it
were at the moon or mars

the rockets of course had been construct-


wonder stories

ed to make contact with the hull and these
rockets were the first tilings that came into
cliffords mind as he bent over the stricken
girl and still they seemed to offer little
hope they were to be discharged by gases
with gradual acceleration as the ship had
been but constructed of only plate steel
they provided little protection against the
absolute cold of space accepting as fact the
prevailing opinion that the temperature of
space was minus  degrees centigrade
or thereabouts even if one could survive
in a specially constructed rocket the steel
walls of the ship and the hull of the rocket
would form a barrier no one knew how to
pass

as clifford pondered these problems the
girl pulled herself together and got to her
feet she said something but clifford could
not make it out for beyond the open doors
the street and city was aroar the whole
town seemed turned upside down the stri-
dent honking of auto horns underscored the
wild shouting of men and boys the wail
of distant sirens and the low bellow of fac-
tory whistles added to make such a bedlam
as only a startled city can make

clifford pressed the switch and the big
doors slid together and muffled the clamor
outside the girl touched his arm and he
looked around to see briggs running back
from the dim recesses of the laboratory as
he came nearer clifford thought he detect-
ed a poorly concealed elation in his bear-
ing as he barked at them

i told you not to meddle there is not
a chance in the world of rescuing him
alive

crystal ran down the aisle between the
grotesque machinery and caught briggs by
the arm

bb what do you mean is he still
alive

how do i know i never sent him off
he evaded brutally

listen to me she cried pulling at him
with nervous little jerks what was he
doing inside the ship

briggs did not seem in the least upset
his smutty eyes rested upon her slight fig-
ure with a contemptuous composure that
seemed to torment her

it wont do any harm to tell you now
he finally answered the governor and i
were working on the idea of carrying pas-
sengers at some time in the future i dis-
covered a method of rinsing the carbon from
respired air so that it might be breathed
again a simple little process that will make
oxygen tanks unnecessary

bb she cried tugging at him again
can you stand there and talk of experi-
ments at a time like this

well why not he resumed and then
as though she had not interrupted at all
the contraption seemed a success and to
prove it  volunteered to let myself be seal-
ed inside the old sport refused and in-
sisted on trying it out himself and since he
was boss i had to let him have his way
he was doing splendidly the last peep i got
at him through the plate glass port hole
bb she cried again were wasting
time let us all forget everything but him
and his peril and get together to find some
way to get him back

how he asked with exasperating
doubt in his tone all hell can t bring
down that ship now

how she repeated mechanically and
looked at clifford

the mail rockets he answered not be-
cause he knew a way but because he wanted
to give her hope

riggs laughed ironically

crystal whirled on hrai and clifford
thought she was going to attack him with
her small strength instead she caught his
arm again then let it go she shrank
away covering her face in the bend of her
white elbow

you planned it she whimpered you
didnt care what became of him just so you
got him out of your way oh bb how
could you

briggs remained stiffly composed

cut out that sob stuff he snapped i
told you not to meddle and this is what
you get

she straightened and her arm came down
from her face and held stiffly at her side
clifford saw that her hand was clenched
tightly she faced briggs as though a wall
the satellite of doom



was at her back and she was determined
to be brave

bb she said slowly we would have
loved you and given you all that you de-
sired if you had let us daddy knew what
he was about he made his fortune by see-
ing opportunities before any one else saw
them and yet you were so afraid hed lose
what he had you--killed him

briggs eyes opened slightly and then con-
tracted he shifted them from the daunt-
less little figure and glared at clifford
then he looked back again and growled

if you ever want to see him again get
busy and quit trying to put the blame onto
me

yes bb she agreed give me some-
thing to do

get marks on the phone ask him to
come down here phone shaffer to roust
out a crew for the shops ill build a spec-
ial rocket and go up after him myself cut
him out with a fusing rod and oxygen flame
now get hold of yourself and help undo
what you have done

he turned on clifford again you get
out of here

clifford stood his ground and stared at
him with a hard glaze upon his eyes

are you going or shall i have you
thrown in the hoosegow

clifford boiled how he wanted to paste
briggs one on his curling lips but he
knew that would not do if briggs had
him arrested on any pretext whatever he
would be unable to form any plan of res-
cue so he walked away slowly despising
himself for being in a position that briggs
could bluff him

before he left the laboratory he heard
the girl call for marks briggs flooded the
place with light as he reached the stairs
and the buzz of machinery began vibrating
over the room

he left the dark house wondering why
briggs had gone to work so quickly to try
effect a rescue did he have some sinister
plan of his own in wanting to be the first
to reach the ship

out into the street he found it swarming
with people who rushed here and there and
tossed every kind of a rumor about he

lighted a cigarette and leaned heavily
against the gate with his mind busy with
the stupendous problem confronting him he
tried to devise some means of rescue as
an hour passed and then another

a dim star rose above the horizon and
mounted swiftly toward the zenith moving
agianst a galaxy of ancient stars the
ship the newest satellite of the universe
while he had been standing there he knew
it had crossed the atlantic met the sun and
the broad light of day over the cities and
villages of europe and asia crossed the
day and night areas of the pacific the
western coast of the united states the
rockies the middle western states and
was now racing toward the atlantic coast
again

speed could man never find its limit

forever and forever that ship would be
on time even when the earth had grown
ancient and old and tottered in its orbit
like a drunken top it would race on and
on earth folks hailed it now with the
same joy they hailed every new discovery
but in a day or two the miracle would be-
come commonplace and men would think it
undignified to pull back their heads to re-
gard its meteorlike flight

he knew he was fortunate it was given
to few men to both dream and accomplish
yet the glory of his triumph was gone by
the thought of rothberg sealed inside die
ship as far as rescue was concerned he
might just as well have been stranded on
the moon

desperate plans

clifford did not trust briggs for an
instant if rothberg went into that
ship voluntarily why had he not first sub-
mitted the plan to his board of scientists
or at least taken his daughter into his con-
fidence before submitting himself wholly
to briggs power

with the vague idea of asking the girl
to hinder rather than help briggs with the
rocket he turned back to the house and
found the front door partly open as he had
left it it seemed that servants and every-
one else were too upset to carry on the reg-


wonder stories

ular routine of life he threaded his way
through the dimly lighted hall and on back
to the laboratory

briggs and crystal were at a desk under
an electric light before them were papers
and blueprints briggs saw him and
scowled the girl did not look up until he
stood beside them then she said bravely
bbs great he has planned a vacuum
tube rocket which shall be warmed chemi-
cally and supplied with oxygen from tanks
how is he going to do any good sealed
inside the tube clifford asked
meddling again briggs growled

not meddling i have a sincere inter-
est in rescuing rothberg you know that
oh yes  know that youve been
spending a lot of his jack of late

bb crystal exclaimed i thought we
were all to work together

briggs put down some figures in a small
cramped hand clifford watched him

what are you going to do when you get
there crystal asked briggs

the devil he exploded one thing at
a time you two wont give me a chance
to think he let his pencil drop to the
table if it will make you any easier ill
tell you that the warm rocket is to be only
a refuge i go out for a few minutes and
work swiftly and return when the cold be-
comes unbearable

you know you cant do that clifford
objected you know that scientists be-
lieve that space has a temperature of minus
two hundred and seventy-three degrees cen-
tigrade

applesauce briggs growled scien-
tists now believe at least some of them do
that space is not much colder than the arc-
tic zone in wintertime possibly not more
than fifty degrees minus i think they are
right too

maybe clifford agreed but what will
happen should you be wrong

he glanced at the girl for approval but
she frowned evidently she thought he was
trying to discourage briggs clifford did
want to discourage him for he did not trust
him at all so he asked in spite of her dis-
tress  do you have any idea how cold

minus two hundred and seventy-three de-
grees is mrs briggs

no she said with despair in her eyes
perhaps  can give you an idea i saw
a rubber ball dropped into a basin of liq-
uid air once you know liquid air is much
warmer than absolute zero when i recov-
ered the rubber and dropped it it shattered
like rotten glass

then there is no hope she asked her
eyes begging for encouragement

there has to be he said emphatically
but to have hope one must be fortified
against such temperatures if one intends to
leave the rocket

ill manage that briggs growled
how clifford insisted

briggs pushed back his sketches and
glared

didnt i tell you to keep out of this
now get this straight we dont need your
help

clifford looked straight at crystal ex-
pecting her to deny that briggs was auth-
orized to speak for her father but she sat
very silent and stared at the paper as
though she wished he would go feeling
uncomfortable he turned and left the labora-
tory wondering whether she really wanted
him to go or not he was still determined
to go ahead with plans of his own regard-
less of whether they were appreciated or
not

he took a taxi and sped to the univer-
sity and called professor mullin from
his class hall

professor he began before mullin was
within ten feet of him did you know roth-
berg is in that ship

what not the satellite

yes and probably suffocating by now
ill tell you how he got there later but
right now i want your help to get him out
my my the professor ejaculated
a very desperate situation

he drew his head back and looked sky-
ward as though looking for proof of that
which he had heard

we havent a minute to lose clifford
continued

but we cant do anything at all mul-
the satellite of doom



lin exclaimed with widening eyes it will
require years maybe centuries of experi-
ment to solve such a problem are you
sure he is in the ship

not sure professor but i intend to go
up and look it over

go up how

the mail rockets

but-

yes and that is why i need your help
and that of the board we must construct
a rocket at once one with special features
so that one may live to make the trip up
and back

but my boy no one could take him out
of the satellite open the port hole and
the pressure of air inside would hurl him
out to be frozen and lost in space that
chamber was sealed at sea level and con-
tains a pressure of fifteen pounds to the
square inch more than a ton to the square
foot youd never find his body after-
wards even with a telescope

 know clifford answered calmly
that is just what i have been worrying
about one cant go about rescue that way
and still briggs is at work trying to do that
very thing i really believe he is trying
to finish rothberg to save his own hide
what are you talking about professor
mullin asked puzzled be plain and dont
get excited lets go over there and sit
down and you can tell me all you know
very well clifford agreed he knew
there was no time to be lost if rothberg
was to be rescued alive but he knew too
that he must explain fully if he expected
mullins help

 he followed the tall figure of the pro-
fessor across to a stone bench and stood
while mullin seated himself then with
one foot on the bench and his fingers work-
ing impatiently he told him all that had
happened the night before

so briggs tried to gas you eh well
well well im really not surprised a
short-sighted man and a dangerous one
he loves money but he shuts it up too
tight to let it grow i suspected he was
anxious for rothberg to die but f never
thought hed murder him

mullin rose abruptly we must get

busy briggs is already hours ahead of us
wait here a minute ill run back to the
office and phone marks and call the board
together

clifford watched the tall dignified man
do his first sprint in years he waited his
mind racing through calculations devising
and rejecting plans for the new rocket
when professor mullin came back the talk
with marks and the other members of the
board seemed to have influenced him a good
deal

marks has absolute faith in briggs and
his rocket he said soberly and the board
has not only expressed faith in him but an
admiration for his willingness to risk his
life going up

id advise you to go over the thing with
crystal she knows a good deal about
briggs and is rather keen on what her fath-
er might wish to be done

a little exasperated with professor mul-
lin he left and went again to the rothberg
place but she was not at home at least to
him there were two strange guards at the
gate who followed him to the street gate
when he was refused admittance

chapter vi
an urgent message

balked but still determined he went
back to town feeling that everyone was
playing into briggs hands even the girl
he really admired her loyalty to her hus-
band yet he knew that she was surely afraid
of him and could hardly have confidence
in him that must she had plainly shown
after the rescue from the vault then why
was she putting her fathers life into the
mans keeping surely she must know that
briggs would never bring rothberg back
alive to incriminate him

puzzled by her actions and the problem
of rescue his brain went around and
around in a perpetual circle of defeat
yet he was by no means ready to give up
he tried to get help from the government
the state the county and finally from
wealthy citizens

the worlds imagination was aroused as


wonder stories

it never had been before floyd collins
penned beneath tons of rock and sand in a
kentucky cave had at one time set its sym-
pathies afire but rothberg confined on an
inaccessible vessel in plain sight of all
stirred sentiment as never before there
came flooding to the press little sketches of
his benefactions and other eulogies from the
men he had helped

for the time the space ship crowded all
other items of news to the back pages
scientists gave their opinion as to the possi-
bility or impossibility of rescue thous-
ands of letters and telegrams poured into
the city to briggs to the foundation and to
clifford money was offered by popular
subscription and private donation some
of it finally came under cliffords control
but by that time briggs was three days
ahead of him and clifford knew that with-
out some miracle he could never beat him

nevertheless he started furiously to work
hoping the miracle would happen he se-
cured the services of a munition works and
laid out plans in accordance with the study
he had given them he also called to his
aid every specialist in the field of rocket
construction his rocket promised to be
something exceptionally good and yet
with all its merit he learned that briggs was
better equipped and making an equally
good or superior rocket and would have it
completed sometime the nexl day whereas
only the skeleton of his own was begun

he met marks downtown that afternoon
marks barely spoke and passed on clif-
ford whistled softly and went his way but
it was quite clear he didnt stand so well at
the rothberg place well he thought
it is just as well that i dont ive  busi-
ness out there anyway

he caught a bus and rode out to the
munition factory intending to spend the
night with his workers

hows it coming he asked the fore-
man as he entered

pretty fast mr peterson were making
real headway every man possible is at
work and they are putting soul and muscle
into every minute of it

drive them foreman clifford com-
manded rothberg is suffering i am sure

he may be dying and every second counts

he did not tell the foreman he was run-
ning a race with briggs but walked down
the rows of screaming lathes and whirling
wheels

by the way he heard above the roar
and din

he turned the foreman had followed
him

what is it he shouted

mrs briggs called for you on the pri-
vate phone

mrs briggs clifford exclaimed

yes she seemed pretty much upset
when i told her you were not here

clifford stepped to a phone booth out of
the clamor and called her she answered
his ring at once as though she had been
waiting for him to call

mr peterson her voice came in a whis-
per come out her quickly

whats wrong he asked sensing that
she was quite alarmed

dont ask i cant tell you she replied
still in a whisper i believe someone is lis-
tening

coming right out clifford assured her

dont come to the house she cautioned
meet me by the fountain in the sunken
garden

he hung up the receiver and opened the
door of the booth ran down the aisle and
out the factory door

ten minutes later he crawled from the
taxi and paid off the driver a block from
the rothberg place then he waited until
the cab drove away before he hurried up
the street and vaulted the low garden wall
where the shadows of the maples were deep-
est crystal appeared from a clump of
foliage as he reached the fountain she
hardly seemed the same woman he had left
working with briggs over the sketches of
the rocket that night in the laboratory

bbs mad she whispered see-hes
here in the garden now waiting for the
ship

clifford glanced through the foliage
and saw briggs tall figure moving
restlessly under the dim reflection of a light
from the street he paced up and down the
the satellite of doom



flagstone walk with his face turned toward
the western horizon

nothing strange about that clifford
said depreciatingly hes not the only man
in the world watching for that ship tonight
maybe im mad also he tried to laugh re-
assuringly

listen she insisted and caught his
hand

briggs hoarse voice came rumbling to
them he was quoting a verse but not as
one soothed by the cadence and rhythm of

it but rather as a man repeating a fearful
curse

the moving finger writes and having
writ

moves on nor all your piety nor wit

shall lure it back to cancel half a line
nor all your tears wash out a word of it
the starlike ship rose out of the west
briggs shrank from it as from a blow he
turned his back upon it but looked over his
shoulder as though he could not take his
eyes away from it

god he rumbled on in that hoarse
deep bass god ive got to

the luminous patch grew larger and lar-
ger against the sky

what do you make of it she asked
hes been going on like that for two nights
now i cant stand it any longer

insane clifford announced slowly
it was the most charitable thing to say and
the easiest way out for her when the truth
became known

i know it she whispered that is why
i must carry on

briggs came up the path she shrank
into the shadows but clifford stood his
ground

she plucked at his sleeve

hide please for my sake she whisper-
ed tensely

he stood undecided

hide-please she begged it wont do
for him to see you here with me

clifford shrugged his shoulders in ac-
quiesence and disappeared into the leaves

briggs came down the path and she step-
ped out to meet him he stopped and
looked down at her his shadow outlined
against a street lamp the glow of the

light put a halo into her yellow hair and
etched the cameolike outline of her profile
with its radiance

for a minute clifford feared for what
briggs might do for it was plain he was
all wrought up and unbalanced he could
see crystals eyes widening as briggs stared
into them and despite her plea he was
about to step out to let briggs know she
was not alone when briggs dropped his
gaze to the fountain and said hoarsely
god i love you that was why i-no
ill forget that now

what do you mean bb she asked ex-
citedly

he stood beside her as though debating
something within himself then he turned
abruptly and said no i dont want to
talk to you about it i want you to think
well of me crystal

he smoked fretfully and seemed unusual-
ly restless as though something weighty
was on his mind after a moment of that
kind of tense silence he began to pace back
and forth across the cement flanking of the
fountain then he faced her turned about
again and walked away

clifford came from his hiding feeling
somewhat ashamed

clifford she said impulsively i feel
despicable to say a thing like this about my
husband but i have a duty to my father
also that is why i called and asked you
to come here i dont believe bb intends to
make the flight at all i believe he is
afraid

what did you want with me he asked
though he knew very well what was coming

i dont want him to go i never did
from the very first but i pretended to trust
him so that he would complete the rocket
bbs gruesome insanely cruel sometimes
but there is no questioning his ability as an
inventor we needed him to perfect the
rocket thinking his own life would pay for
any mistake he made

she laid her hand on his shoulder i
know its a good deal like asking your life
but will you go up

yes he answered his heart leaping
and added softly for him and you


wonder stories

the struggle for the rocket

she took her hand from him and drew
back as though she was suddenly
afraid and said hurriedly

come at daybreak ill let you in at
the back gate you will be off before he
knows it i will hinder him in some way

she left him and ran swiftly up the path

clifford remained rigidly where she had
left him until he saw the light of the porch
flash upon her white dress as she opened
the front door and entered the house the
door closed quietly behind her he waited
wondering just what to do he was wor-
ried for what might happen with her alone
in that house with briggs and still he felt
he ought to get away from the garden and
come back as she had asked undecided he
waited on listening for a cry fearing she
might be in peril hoping that briggs would
come out so that he could feel easier about
her

a distant motor truck growled as it labor-
ed up blackstone hill a flash of headlights
swept this way and that as a belated auto
sped along the drive the low blast of a tug-
boat moaned as it moved up harbor fretful
broken noises of the citys sleep

then there was a sleep stir throughout
the city blatant honking of autos on the still
night greeting again the rising of the earths
newest satellite

the city quieted again and clifford sank
upon a stone bench the night was warm
the air calm he had not slept for three
nights and yet he was not at all drowsy
briggs was on his mind he knew the man
had daring and nerve then how could
crystal be right about him being afraid
it was a fearful thing to leave the earth
which confined all men and risk the un-
known of the cosmos

he half expected to see briggs come
slinking from the house to watch the ship
again as it mounted the sky to hear him
repeat again the lines he had turned into a
curse to see him turn his back and look
over his shoulder as though the ship was a
magnet his eyes could not shake off

and when briggs did not come he felt
even more uneasy about the girl it was

certain she was afraid and only a sense of
loyalty to an unfortunate husband kept her
within him twice clifford started to the
house twice he returned and finally the
time came for him to meet her he cir-
cled a private hedge and reached the rear
gate she wtas there waiting and put a
finger to her lips as a signal for silence

unexpectedly the gale to the rocket yard
opened bnd briggs stood as glowering as a
thunder cloud

what are you doing her at this hour
he growled

clifford pushed his bulk through the gate
into the rocket yard im going to use
your rocket briggs

you are going to get out of here or be
carried out feet first briggs roared

clifford glanced around the yard the
rocket angled its long gray nose toward the
sky which was just becoming flushed with
the pink of dawn it was indeed a beauti-
ful machine stream-lined and fully equip-
ped there were searchlights mirrors for
observation crawlers to take her about over
the hull of the satellite oxygen tanks and
every other contrivance imaginable to as-
sure safety and comfort of course first
glance did not reveal all that much of it
he discovered a few minutes later but a
glance did reveal that briggs had made a
perfect passenger rocket

the door of the rocket chamber was
ajar whether briggs had just left it or it
was open accidentally he did not know
the switch which would fire the rocket at
the next passage of the ship was also open

clifford glanced at his watch only
three minutes to wait

he shot a right uppercut into briggs jaw
and behind that swing he put the hard hit-
ting vim of his hundred and seventy-five
pounds it took briggs by complete sur-
prise and sent him grabbing at the gravel

clifford hurdled across the yard and
closed the contact switch then climbed into
the rocket chamber and whirled down the
levers which closed the door

he glanced again at his watch as briggs
got to his feet a full minute before con-
tact briggs shook back his disordered
hair and looked groggily around he ap-
the satellite of doom



parently noticed the closed rocket switch
and ran for it but crystal threw herself
upon him and circled his waist with her
arms

clifford knew that contact was at
hand and tightened down the levers
it was a fifty-fifty chance whether briggs
would make the switch before the ship pass-
ed and the rocket was automatically fired

briggs came on dragging the girl but
badly hampered briggs turned on her and
struck her in the face time was up clif-
fords blood boiled but he couldnt leave
then not even to help the girl contact
was at hand he got one more glimpse of
briggs a short bull nose pistol was in his
hand and though clifford heard no report
inside that tight tube he did see a whiff of
thin blue smoke and noticed the revolver
was not aimed at him nor the girl but at
the chronometer which closed the contact
and that was all he saw for he was catapul-
ted upward toward the sky

too late you fool clifford thought as
he felt the rocket rising with increasing
speed vaulting him up up up out of the
garden out of the world leaving the earth
shrinking like a dwindling landscape far far
below

launched into strange and unknown dan-
gers he had no thought of them but was
wondering about the two he had left so far
below in the rocket yard

five minutes passed he wailed anx-
iously for the banging contact with the steel
hull of the satellite ten minutes passed
and nothing at all not the slightest noise

impossible what had happened had
he actually touched the vessel and there
been no noise due to vacuum of space
he knew there could be no noise outside
the tube for there was no air to carry sound
but inside the air should have carried it to
him

another minute went by he looked out
the port hole again and again he could
sec nothing had briggs overheard bis
talk with the girl and changed the chrono-
meter to send him out before the ship pass-
ed was he lost in the infinite stretches
of space

the observing mirrors were folded back
into the niches of the rocket hull to protect
them from the burning air on the trip up
he knew that he was then far above the fric-
tion of air and he decided to use them to
try get a glimpse of the earth he worked
them out and found there was no friction
against them at all he did not even seem
to be moving he felt as though he were
suspended in space without motion or di-
rection he felt as fixed as though he were
anchored to the solid earth and yet he knew
he could have hardly lost the furious velo-
city he had gained

his mirrors caught the earth far below
he must have already have travelled
around it for a long ways for the land-
scape seemed whirling backward dizzily as
though he looked down from the window of
a speeding plane twirling his mirrors
about for new angles he realized that he
was caught in an orbit all his own and was
one of the two earth beings out in space
beyond human help the great gulf of
space spread about him and the tawny
world below seemed exotic and bare swept
now and then by a curtain of cloud bank
and again caught in the shining splendor of
the blazing sun

with a feeling of resignation he turned
his mirrors hopelessly he caught some-
thing else in the glass the space ship
briggs could not have changed the chrono-
meter after all why the sixteenth of a sec-
ond would account for that quarter of a
mile miss il must have been that shot
briggs gave the chronometer which had done
the trick the bullet must have closed the
contact just the fraction before the ship was
due for he was ahead of the ship

he gazed pop-eyed at the long gray
thing seemingly at rest with its head point-
ed toward him it was only a quarter of a
mile away and yet it might as well have
been a thousand miles

he wondered if he could devise some
way to slow up so that the ship might over-
take him but he knew that in space noth-
ing would offer die least brake to his speed
the mirror caught the blazing sun against
a black sky totally devoid of stars a mys-
tic unreal sun a weird uncanny sky and

he wa alone with only a thermos bottle of
coffee

chapter vii
still alive

what could he do absolutely noth-
ing his problem as great as lhat
of rescuing rothberg he thought of re-
leasing part of the gases in the head of the
rocket and taking ihe risk of them pro-
jecting him back lo earth but that would be
too cowardly how could he face crystal
after his failure

then he found a new puzzle why was
the sun in the glass was he falling
something certainly had happened to alter
his course

he looked for the satellite but it was
nowhere to be seen that was queer he
had not changed the levers which moved the
mirrors he worked the mirror about and
again caught a view of the ship he drew
his free hand across his forehead was he
going daft was there some fluid in those
upper regions to which steel was permeable
and which had affected his brain so that
he was seeing things the magnets in the
nose of the rocket were full on and yet the
heavy steel base was pointing toward the
satellite not only that but the ship was
between him and the earth no-it was
coming up moving around him in a circle
and the butt of the rocket followed it like
a compass needle

the ship rose and eclipsed the sun
then it occurred to him lhat the truth was
the satellite was still and the rocket was
circling it for he remembered lhat there
would be an attraction between two bodies
moving freely in space and that the smaller
body would form a satellite of the larger
and yet those strong magnets in the head
of the rocket did not seem lo take hold of
the ship at the distance of a quarter of a
mile although they were the most powerful
magnets that had ever been made

around and around the ship he went like
the little rubber ball he had swung around
his head that night at the board meeting-
like one of the carriage of an invisible fer-
ns wheel with its hub at the ship he felt

as though he were floating in oceans of air
what little gravity he felt was directed tow-
ard the steel mass at the base of his tube
and not toward the earth at all

but he had little time to wonder at the
new laws which had control of him he
was in the most desperate situation imagin-
able one that was entirely foreign to hu-
man experience and he would have to do
some bold pioneer thinking if he were
to extricate himself

gazing out the window of his little room
he decided to take a long chance really the
only one possible he pulled the switch
which discharged the gases in the head of
his rocket the butt of the rocket pointed
directly toward the ship and clifford knew
a little gas might do no good at all and too
might send him ricocheting far beyond the
pull of the ship and make his position even
worse-if such a thing were possible in
truth though he did not expect anything
to happen at all

he released a fraction of the gas in the
nose of the rocket to his surprise he went
winging aross the quarter of a mile and he
cut his gas immediately before he hard-
ly knew what happened his rocket swapped
ends the magnets caught the pull o the
steel ship and with a resounding jar he
made contact head on as neatly as he could
have wished

even in his joy at having retrieved him-
self from a hopeless situation he thought
with a great deal of interest of the mechan-
ism of the rocket that permitted it to move
through the vacuity of space surely there
was no atmosphere where he was for the
friction of il would have started him in a
spiral descent toward the earth then what
law caused the change ok velocity and en-
abled him to make contact

he pondered over the thing as he moved
his crawlers this way and that  working
back and forth over the huge hull in hie
search for the porthole

deeply engrossed with this problem
for the scientific trend of his nature
was always alert one of his mirrors discov-
ered the porthole and he worked his rocket
over near it
the satellite of doom



the glass was opaque with frost which
had gathered inside the ship he extended
one of the mirrors so that it tapped on the
glass he waited and tapped again

was rothberg dead was he all alone
beyond the barriers which divided life to
earth 

sad and discouraged he waited and lap-
ped again then he gasped with joy
something was rubbing away at the frost
on the glass rothberg must be alive

he watched breathlessly as a place was
cleaned and the drawn face of the old man
pressed against the glass there seemed to
be a hopeless bravery in the haggard fea-
tures as the gray old eyes searched about
lo seek the cause of that noise out in the
cosmos rothbergs eyes opened with a
start hope leaped into them every fea-
ture portrayed the fight for control he made
as he took in the rocket and then clifford
himself

before clifford could send any kind of a
signal rothberg left the porthole and soon
he returned with an empty pitcher which he
turned upside down and motioned to his
throat indicating it was choked and dry
clifford noticed that he was gasping the
ship was big and had contained a good many
cubic feet of air but it was plain that roth-
berg now had little of it left to breathe
briggs most certainly had lied about his in-
vention to rinse carbon from respired air
rothberg must have help soon or there
would be no need of it at all

even as rothberg stared at him hope
seesmed to fade from ihe kindly old face
he was no mean scientist and certainly
knew what insurmountable difficulties to
his rescue clifford motioned that he must
return better equipped before he could hope
to do anything

the old eyes smiled encouragement but
the chin sagged a little and then drew up
tight and firm plainly rothberg believed
he would never come out alive yet what
could clifford do to encourage him the
immutable laws which confined life to ihe
earth were all against him try as he
would he could think of no plan to enter
the ship without exposing both of them to
certain death

he glanced at his chronometer the loss
in not making direct contact had eaten heav-
ily into his time and he was nearly back
around the earth again time to kick off
was at hand he indicated with motions
that he would soon be back and rothberg
took his finger and wrole on a portion of
the frosted glass

tell crystal bb-

the sentence was but started whatever
he wrote or intended to write clifford
could not know for contact came and the
gases discharged he was shot away in a
few seconds he found himself floating down-
ward as the blades of his helicopter caught
the rare upper air and began to race fur-
iously above the tube

he had been but a few seconds going up
it took him an hour to come down teles-
copes on the earths surface must have pick-
ed up his descent for there were ten thous-
and people gathered around the farmstead
near the outskirts of town when he landed
he opened the door and staggered out of the
rocket then thousand voices and auto
horns drove him deaf with their raucous
noise

the solution at last

he paid no attention to the insistent re-
porters who trailed him all he want-
ed was a phone to find out what had hap-
pened in the rocket yard after he had left
among all that sea of faces about him was
none he felt he could ask such a personal
question he hailed a car and the man in-
side seempd glad to be of service clif-
ford asked to be driven at once to the muni-
tion works which was only a mile away
they went into seventy by the time they
were on the highway

at the works he got hold of crystal and
was much relieved when she answered the
phone

mrs briggs he said and found it hard
to get used to the fact that she was bbs
wife i have good news for you

tell me she begged is he alive
yes he is alive but his condition is des-
perate your-i mean there were no pro-
visions made for oxygen or water i dont
know about food


wonder stories

could you speak with him at all
no but i saw him plainly at the port
hole he seemed brave but rather discour-
aged i dont think he has much hope
have you she begged did you find
anything to give hope

not up there he replied and wondered
whether he should tell her the truth there
is no way i can think of to transfer him to a
rocket while the ship is aloft we must
bring her down

but you said it couldnt be brought
down that it was like death you told
bb that and its true

listen a minute he insisted i forgot
one thing when i told briggs that
what she cried eagerly

that the ship wa of steel well have
to build magnets

magnets

yes powerful enough to hinder the ship
at every revolution so that its speed may be
checked enough to bring it under the influ-
ence of the earths gravity

but that would crush him

no get hold of blair and the rest of the
board it will take close calculations but
the ship can be brought down in a spiral
which will increase as it meets the friction
of heavier and heavier layers of air blair
can calculate where to place our magnets
so as to let her drop in the sea outside the
harbor she is hollow and will rise and we
can get him out

oh god she said earnestly i hope
you are right

he hung up and went back to the plant
in an hour gertz played ralls and
blair were there and a few minutes later
crystal and briggs came into the dingy room
used as an office

briggs regarded clifford with the eyes of
a wary cat there was a hint of suppressed
ferocity in his manner and an excited cur-
iosity in his gaze but he did not ask how
clifford had fared aloft nor what he had
learned in fact he tried to act as though
nothing had happened that morning in the
rocket yard clifford after a look of ap-
praisal gave him no more attention and went
over to the group of scientists who had al-

ready gathered crystal followed him and
briggs remained near the door

he explained in a few words how he had
started work on the largest electro-magnets
ever constructed and how he hoped to ham-
per the speed of the satellite until it would
respond to the earths gravitational influ-
ence he asked blair to calculate where
the magnets would have to be mounted to
bring down the ship just off shore in the
atlantic and asked gertz to calculate the
power necessary to influence the ship

gertz listened until clifford had finished
and then he shook his warty little head
ralls echoed that shake by a baffled ex-
pression on his lean features

your theory will not work out gertz
whispered to him so that the girl could not
hear

why clifford asked alarmed

gertz lowered one eyelid as though try-
ing to penetrate a deep distance i be-
lieve you had a fair example of how short a
distance the magnetic field will affect in the
way your magnets acted in the rocket as you
circled the ship two hundred miles is en-
tirely too far for the last hope that the use
of electro-magnets will bring down the
ship

clifford dared not look at crystal he
knew the expression on his face would be-
tray him but he did not look at briggs
who had pushed into the group to catch
what gertz was saying briggs face was an
impersonal mask if he felt any emotion
he did not show it by the slightest change
of expression

has anything gone wrong crystal ask-
ed as silence seemed to smother the little
group

clifford ran his fingers through his short
cropped hair and made no reply

to cover their gloom the scientists dis-
cussed electro-magnetism with an air of ab-
straction which revealed that their minds
were on something else

what has gone wrong crystal asked
again

nothing nothing at all clifford
shouted nervously above the low buzz of
voices
the satellite of doom



every man in the room turned upon him
as though they thought his worry had sud-
denly turned him daft

ive got it he shouted again and
waived a doubled fist listen you men
find some flaw in this if you can rock-
ets are the solution after all we have
dozens of them ready at the laboratory fill
them with bar magnets to increase their
weight and hold on the ship fire enough
of them to hamper her and bring her down
in a spiral until she hits the sea

youve got it gertz beamed pounding
his fist on his knee fire them with no
more velocity than just to make contact
they will drag her down the problem of
how many is for professor blair

cliffords eyes were glowing as he looked
at the girl and then for briggs but briggs
had disappeared not that anyone cared
bb had been useful in completing the rock-
ets but now nothing more complicated than
bar magnets were needed to do the work

daybreak came again and clifford stood
beside the girl as the rockets shrieked up-
ward to meet the ship they watch
through telescopes which had been mounted
in the yard

clifford turned to the foremen and de-
manded 

there are eleven of them blair said
there should only be ten great god you
will drown him sure

we fired only ten the foreman declared
stubbornly didnt i count them myself
every man working counted them there
were only ten	

clifford drew his lips thin and wondered
if he had miscounted the ship was then
past the vision of his telescope and too far
away to recount but one thing was cer-
tain she was coming down swiftly the
halt in her flight and the curvature of her
orbit were apparent even though blair had
figured it would take three revolutions to
bring it down and it would fall faster when
it encountered denser air

though six hours remained before they
expected the ship to fall there was an im-
mediate surge for the shore line thous-
ands of autos crammed each other and
honked for room they crowded each oth-

er and edged for positions as close as pos-
sible to the point professor blair had picked
for the landing

that extra rocket troubled clifford no
little though he said no more about it he
got crystal and a number of close friends
aboard a small cutter and pushed off to
avoid the mob ashore briggs could not be
found crystal seemed worried but the in-
tense suspense as to the fate of her father
must have kept her mind off him to some ex-
tent for she did not mention him in all the
six hours she wailed-watching the passing
of the steel satellite in its narrowing orbit

noon came the summer sun blazed
down upon the swelling waves as
they came sweeping in from the limitless
sea thousands upon thousands of people
who jammed the shore had been waiting
since early morning

chapter viii

a rescue and a tragedy

they milled about raising a ceaseless
dust which settled slowly in the calm
suffocating heal and still they held tena-
ciously to their places near the shore

little boats and large ones ploughed here
and there seeking a point of vantage back
of the long watery lane governed by govern-
ment cutters

someone shouted there it comes

the shout was taken up and tossed from
man to man heads craned and all eyes
strained toward the east the wave of hu-
manity on shore surged forward there
were cries the shouting of officers and
shouting of the eager curious mass they
sought to hold in check ten thousand
hands shaded ten thousand upturned eyes
from the glare of the high noonday sun

a huge monoplane swept in from the
sea bringing passengers from down coast
to witness the most marvelous landing in
the history of men and when the mob
saw the new comer was no more than a huge
plane it wailed in disappointment but did
not retreat in the slightest

minutes passed the sultry heat seemed
almost unbearable the rails of the cutter


wonder stories

were like furnace rods fresh from ihe fire
clifford shielded crystal with her lavender
parasol taking the sun himself

and then from out the horizon sped a
long gray shape silent as an oncoming
hawk it was not riding high as had been
expected but hugging the sea even as
they watched it spanked the water and sent
a long silver veil of spray sparkling into
the sun

crystal caught her hands together and
stood petrified unable lo bring her glasses
to her eyes for a better view clifford felt
a thrill not wholly accounted for by the
success of the rescue something historic
was taking place something which held a
marvelous prophecy-that some day this
miracle should become an hourly occur-
rence and earth folks would ride in from
the cosmos to land with exactness at every
port of the world

the ship came speeding on skipping up-
on the water like a flat rock tossed across
the surface of a pond she dove and
stortz groaned and leaned far over the rail
she rose her wet steel glistening in the
sunlight and still crystal made not the
slightest move

a mile away clifford saw that something
was riding her back he brought his for-
gotten glasses to his eyes it was a rocket
one that seemed strangely familiar even at
that distance it looked like the one that
briggs had made for the rescue flight
there were eleven after all briggs must
have fired the other one in hopes of sinking
the ship

good god clifford breathed and the
girl turned about and found her voice at
last

is he dead she screamed is he dead

clifford shook his head but his heart
sank for he felt lhat it would be only a
question of minutes now that eleventh
rocket was dragging down the ship it
was diving again plowing deep and then
wallowing back to the surface like a wound-
ed sea beast

clifford turned to the captain of the cut-
ter have you a rifle on board

why yes the captain answered plain-
ly puzzled

have one brought to me at once sits
it may save the satellite

the captain barked an order clifford
looked again at the satellite wallowing
along half under water

get to as quick as you can captain
he begged

the captain shouted an order and the
cutter got under way

the satellite was still moving swiftly but
losing its speed like a passenger train draw-
ing into a station someone handed clif-
ford a rifle he took it and did not look
around his eyes still upon the satellite

wlial are you going to do crystal
cried

briggs bullet set off the rocket in the
yard  am hoping mine will shake her
loose from the ship

with a scream of discharging gases the
rocket soared away with such rapidity the
eye could hardly follow its long gray shape
into the air but clifford was not trying
to watch its meteorlike flight he was look-
ing at the satellite the shock had sent her
under again but before she was swallowed
by the sea something long and rigid toppled
from the soaring rocket and struck the glist-
ening hull a man had fallen stiffly from
the rocket and as he struck the hull he
shattered into a thousand flying ruby crys-
tals which sparkled in the sun frozen in
the absolute cold of space he had shattered
like rotten glass clifford thought of the
little rubber ball he had dropped into the
container of liquid air

its bb the girl screamed and covered
her eyes with her hands

clifford caught her and looked down at
the undulating surface of the glittering sea
the satellite was nowhere to be seen

for a moment not a sound came from sea
or deck except the lapping of waves and
the throb of engines clifford still held
crystal and felt her shaken with despair
he did not know how to comfort her all
that he could do was to stand stiffly and
think

suddenly he heard another bark of or-
ders a running of hurried feet across
deck the confused shouting and reshout-
ing of orders
the satellite of doom



boats were being lowered wby

he looked again down at the sea and saw
a feeble churning of the water near the
place where the satellite had gone down
a head came above the wavs and then sank
from sight

rothberg lie must have broken the
porthole glass and come up as the ship
sank

a week later rothberg was about again
he beamed at clifford as he came into the
room crystal was standing beside his
chair watching clifford with a new admira-
tion in her eyes

there is one thing that puzzles me
clifford said and that is what killed
briggs what was he doing up there any-
way

rothbergs mouth drew firm and crystal
looked at the pattern of a rich rug which
was spread across the floor

the answer is very simple rothberg
answered after a pause i saw him make
contact and watched him through the port-
hole he opened the door of the rocket and
it seemed his chest literally blew open like

a rotten tire under too much pressure he
had a sledge hammer in his hand and  took
it he planned to break the porthole glass
no doubt he would have succeeded but he
overlooked the fact that the pressure of air
inside his lungs was fifteen pounds to the
square inch he had on some kind of a
jacket to protect him from the cold but the
explosion blew it wide open

rothberg shook bis shoulders as though
ridding himself of what had occurred up
there then he said confidently

were going it for satellites right this
time my boy fit them for passengers as
well as mail its a big thing that we have
circlcd the earth in two hours but eventual-
ly we may run an air line between here and
venus you know the main problem of in-
terplanetary flight has been that of landing
the ship and now we have solved that

he put his large veined hands upon the
girl crystal little soldier get out and
let us get to work

she turned and left them reluctantly
clifford watched her until she reached the
door she turned and though neither said
a word a glance between them held a pro-
mise that all would turn out right

the thing came down on the village like a
cyclone burning through it and leaving it a de-
solate wreck

arctic wastes might have bloomed like tropical
gardens but something went wrong
and disaster folloivedl

chapter i

i heard about it from one and another
of a mystified populace the radio bul-
letins had called it the uncontrollable de-
stroyer newspapers had referred to it as a
natural phenomenon and had created an
alarm it seemed over nothing it turned
out to be one of the most astounding things
lhat even this modern world of  had
been privileged to see

the people were filled with both awe and
terror long before i knew of the existence
of the so-called hot spot the chemical
phenomenon that appeared over the north
pacific and startled airmen and operators
of aircraft throughout the world

having gleaned from news bulletins noth-

ing more than the fact of its existence-after
discrediting the usual traditional newspaper
tales-i was determined as an aeronautical
engineer to learn more about it

i was seated in the lounging room of the
cosmopolitan club at the grand central
air terminal in los angeles when joe
blaine set down from a freight hop to vlad-
ivostok the minute i saw his great sesqui-
amphibian trundle up to the loading dock
i knew she had weathered an unusual storm
her great wings were all but limp and one
of the tips of the upper surface had been
torn away as neatly as if it had been cut
with a huge pair of scissors her motors
died quickly as if the mechanics were in
great haste to stop their vacuum-cleaner-iike

illustrated by marchioni

whirr she sat there in silence for but a
moment and then the door of the control
room opened and joe blaines first mechanic
came down followed by his assistant

they were greeted by an anxious dis-
patcher who waited there at the ladder un-
til captain blaine emerged from the control
room and  joined them there wondering
what could have taken place blaine stolid
immaculate and young came down to gaze
steadily at that torn wing for a moment
before turning to us and heaving a long
drawn out sigh

such heat i have never seen he said to
the dispatcher after having nodded to us
a hurried greeting the telephones went



out ihe minute i got your orders to swing
north and that was all that saved me that
was six hours ago had i waited to change
my course i would have flown directly into
ihe path of the thing it was a phenomenon
beyond my comprehension-a ray of light
that boiled the ocean below us and when
i turned and flew away from it the plane
was lifted several thousand feet in the heavy
updraft that came from that furnace-like
spot on the surface of the sea we did not
find clearance for five miles north of there
look at the plane-you know the rest

g astro the dispatcher as well as the
rest of us were astounded we search


wonder stories

ed each others faces for an answer to this
strange mystery but no manner of specula-
tion would solve it we went into the office
where captain blaine sat down to write out
his report all the lime being interrupted
by gastro

but there wasnt any report on it from
the weather bureau objected the dis-
patcher if it is a sunspot-

sunspot ridicu-
lous captain blaine
looked up from his re-
ports do you think
a sunspot would affect
an area of only five
miles square do you
think a sunspot would
melt off the end of one
wing of my plane-a
few feet at the tip -
and boil the water of
the sea i feel for-
tunate gastro to have
flown out of it in the
face of such terrific
heat look at the sides
of my plane the
varnish is melted
away why even the
wing covering is shriv-
eled

while i waited anx-
iously for the captain
to finish his reports

gastro stepped from
the room into the of-
fices of the weather
bureau he returned
presently to shake his
head doubtfully and
pace the floor

hang it all blaine
cant you tell me some-
thing more about this
hot spot wasnt
there anything above or below it that might
have caused the trouble cant you give
me a faint idea of what caused it the
officials of tlie company are too much
disturbed about this for a mere report

id be glad to tell the board of directors
what i have told you if in my haste i

have neglected to mention something i am
sorry but it is just as i told you i was
flying three hundred miles per hour at ten
thousand feet when i saw a shimmer on the
ocean and felt a draught of hot air through
the ventilator as the heat increased i
called you to report it and before we could
finish our conversation the radiophone went
out i swung lo the north and barely es-
caped complete de-
struction

how do you know
it was five miles across
it

i only approximat-
ed it by the distance
i flew to get around it
it may have traveled
north as i did

  

that was all i
learned of the uncon-
trollable destroyer
lhat day the radio
bulletin carried tire
news to the world and
astronomers and me-
teorologists through-
out the globe specu-
lated upon the possi-
bilities of this strange
phenomenon

passenger traffic had
long ago ceased to
travel the great circle
route to siberia but
the freight planes had
found belter flying
conditions up there
dozens of great planes
flew through this area
weekly not one of
those that came in a
few hours either before
or after captain blaine
had seen any indication of what had been
reported by this young airman and his
crew but it was assumed at the meeting
of the board of directors where captain
blaine told his story that hardly any two
planes lhat flew out to vladivostok over
this route would strike exactly the same

y ne of the greatest sour-
ces of misfortune to the
race is the fact that so
many million square miles
of the earths surface must
remain desolate arctic
wastes while the habitable
portions of the globe are
over-crowded many sci-
entists have spent a good
deal of time and energy in
the attempt to find a means
to transform what is now
barren into a place fit for
human ssse one such
scheme for example would
divert the gulf stream
from its course across the
atlantic in order that it
shall warm our north at-
lantic seaboard there is
no doubt that any scheme
that could make alaska
the arctics northern can-
ada greenland etc places
of moderate climate would
be of the greatest benefit
to the human race but
such a gigantic plan could
not succeed before many
disheartening and often
tragic experiments were
made we can thus sympa-
thize with our poor profes-
sor in this original and ex-
citing story for we know
that his motives were of
 the best
tiie flaming cloud



latitude this was a point in captain
blaines favor for he was known among
his fellow flyers and the directors of sev-
eral air lines as having always cut down
the regular schedule by hours wherever he
flew

rphe investigation consumed but half an
 i hour but two more hours were spent
in speculation as he aeronautical expert
of the company l was of course invited to
attend it was when president fred brett-
ner the young and adventurous airman who
had become an official of the company
arose to speak in ihe midst of rampant dis-
cussion that all eyes were turned to him
as always in the face of
sudden and unexplained
danger mens fears were
overcoming their judg-
ment and it was evident
that effective leadership
and determined action
was necessary unless
that action came the
meeting would degener-
ate into the heated squab-
bles of panic-stricken and
fear dazed men brett-
ner spoke quietly

joe blaine and i are
going to retrace his course
in a fast plane this after-
noon he announced

we wont have it
said the chairman we
cannot afford to take chances on losing you
let me suggest that you send an engineer a
man who is familiar with geology astron-
omy and meteorology i think thomason
will be the man

my heart leaped to my throat blaine
turned to me and smiled as if pleased with
the suggestion several members of the
board nodded i arose to thank them two
hours later we were making preparations to
fly back over the north pacific and into the
territory that had already become known to
airmen as the hot spot and to the news
bulletins as the uncontrollable destroyer
some poetic intuition must have given the

phenomenon that name for it seemed to
have certainly justified it even before a day
had passed

chapter ii
the hot spot

our plane was the latest thing in
speedy aircraft from her great rick-
man-conroff motor to her telescopic wings
she was an innovation it might be men-
tioned here that her wings were as the
name implies capable of being taken in
after the ship left the ground thus decreas-
ing resistance as the motor revved up 
and she straightened out we needed all
her wing surface to lift the heavily loaded
little ship off the ground
but once in the air the
powerful motor pulled
her along with such force
that only half her maxi-
mum wing surface was
needed

the work of telescop-
ing the wing was dne
with a tiny crank in the
control cabin that ac-
complished the plane
shot forward with the
speed of a bullet within
six hours we had covered
the distance towhere cap-
tain blaine had lai seen
the hot spot

at first we found 
trace of the phenomenon
we flew for hours through all kinds of
weather from rain and wind to heavy snow
and sleet and all that time i was trying
to arrive at some conclusion as to the cause
of this supposed ray of heat wondering if
it were the work of experimenters or a
natural result of changes in the atmosphere
or if it was a distorted sun ray

once we lilted through a maze of clouds
to look down upon a storm-torn strip of
land that we found to be one of the aleu-
tian island chain il was ihen that we de-
cided to turn to the northeast and fly slow-
ly to the coast of alaska thus captain
blaine extended the wing surface of the

plane and cut the motor down to a few
revolutions below cruising speed we set-
tled back in comfort to study the skyline
the sun was setting

blaine turned to me and said well
never find it today-it follows the sun im
sure its a ray otherwise it would have re-
mained somewhere near the latitude in
which i first saw it

i was still speculating as to this possi-
bility and hardly answered him we were
running down the aleutians and an inter-
esting stretch of islands lay before and
beneath us then i saw something off to the
left that froze my eyes to the spot just
where the water met the land there was a
stretch of burned-over ground across a
tiny peninsula it ended in the water again
and began on the other side-just a burned
path that extended farther and was lost in
the distance i pointed it out to captain
blaine

calm and cool he did not speak but
immediately kicked in the throttle took in
some of the wing surface and banked over
until the nose of the plane was pointed at
the spot we came down upon it within a
few seconds and were following it out into
the northern wastes when i saw something
else that immediately caught and held my
attention ahead of us and just over the
end of the wide path of fire and destruction
was a bright ray of light that seemed to
extend up into the heavens until its source
was lost and where it moved compara-
tively slowly toward the east it left on the
ocean a trail of boiling water and on land
a wake of charred surface it seemed mov-
ing in the direction of nome

e were horrified and yet we knew
that immediate action was necessary
the heat left the air bumpy and rough and
the plane was unsteady and hard to handle
captain blaine was fighting the controls
as if he were steering an ocean liner in a
hurricane we were soon wiping perspir-
ation from our brow

got to get up and above it-find some
reason for it he mumbled i think it
drifts with the wind youll notice that
every tailwind we get follows the path cur-

rents might miss nome by a few milea
the air about us was getting hotter and
hotter it became stifling we could hard-
ly breathe i thought captain blaine would
turn and run away from it but instead he
gained altitude until we were at twenty-
three thousand feet from which distance the
bright ray of fire look on a different aspect
it seemed to be about a mile across from
bottom to top it did not vary more than a
few yards it continued lo move with the
wind like a huge cylinder being blown
along the radiation of heat was such that
we had to remain several miles away from
it sometimes we circled it only to come
around again behind it and watch it cross
the tiny islands and leave the surface a
charred mass dip into the sea and boil it
with the suddenness of a red hot iron being
dropped into a glass of water

captain blaine ordered me to inform the
weather bureau and the officials of the
company of what we had found fred
rrettner was on the telephone when i called
the offices of the international airlines no
sooner had i described the strange phantom
of destruction than he began making sug-
gestions in spite of the static fly above it
if you can -your plane is good for thirty-
six thousand feet and shes all metal pull
on your oxygen masks and dive into it a
far as you can bring back some idea as
to what causes it-ill have the government
patrol to your assistance if that will help
i thanked brettner and hung up inform-
ing blaine of his suggestion that we fly
above the cylinder of flame the captain
immediately extended his wing surface and
kicked the throttle open a few minutes
later we were at thirty-five thousand feet
our oxygen masks were adjusted and the
tanks were turned on it was then that
captain blaine slowly edged into the path
of the cylinder and we discovered that the
top of it was on an elevation of about thirty
thousand feet he kept the nose of the plane
down in the direction of the ray until the
heat stifled us and shot the plane several
thousand feet up into the sky almost be-
fore we realized it he fought with the
controls and he was nearly exhausted be-
fore they responded i looked at the alti-
the flaming cloud



meter forty-three thousand feet and
directly below us was the flat top of that
cylindrical ray that so astounded us it
was moving with the wind

a-chemical-compound of some kind
gasped the pilot at my side a freak of
nature-or an experiment of some sort run-
ning wild well-

the moving destroyer

he pointed off to the right just over the
edge of the ray a great plane hung
there weaving in and out of the cloudy
edge of il her motors full out her nose
pointed downward into the face of the ter-
rific pressure of heavy air that came from
the hot spot

why doesnt he run away from it
screamed blaine over the whirr of the mo-
tor to which he had given full throttle he
nosed the plane downward into the face of
the pressure and despite the great power
that pulled our plane despite the fact that
our nose was pointed straight down we
found difficulty in descending we swel-
tered under the heat and gasped for breaths
of air from our oxygen tanks as we dived
straight into the top of the thing

as we neared the great cylindrical cloud
it took on the aspect of a gaseous substance
its color seemed to change as we looked
down into it it was no longer a yellow
light ray it became a cloud of vapor-like
stuff but the temperature was the same
we watched the other plane while our
motor strained in its effort to pull us down-
ward and we saw that the great craft was
turning from the mass and flying away
going off at an angle to escape the center
of that terrific updraft

i suggested to blaine to follow the other
plane he pulled the nose up and shot out
toward it it was apparently trying to
escape us was almost out of sight before
we thought to take in some of our wing
surface and give chase however it was
not long before we were gaining on it and
the mass of heat fell over the horizon be-
hind us we were headed in the direction
of seattle with a strong wind pushing us
along

get his number-dont lose it captain
blaine shouted as we sped down upon the
tail of the fleeing ship

af i announced as we came along-
side the giant monoplane

holy skyhooks where have i seen that
plane before exclaimed the captain do
you see that tube running from the lower
side of the fuselage

what has that to do with it i asked
excitedly

thats professor edwin metters chem-
ical laboratory

what-starting something he cant
stop

met him when he dropped in for sup-
plies at tokyo on my last run down there
thinks he has a way to change the climate
of the arctic regions i guess it got away
from him

we flew down upon the other plane her
five great motors were wide open but she
made little noise i opened a window and
yelled through to a pale little man who
stood looking at us through an upper port
hole shamefaced he opened the hinged
cover and tried to speak

chapter iii

devastation

the shaky little man was plainly con-
fused his hands played over the
port hole and his face twitched the slip-
stream played havoc with his thick shock
of white hair he had all the appearance
of a wild man and yet his appearance was
pathetic enough to cause us to laugh in the
face of what appeared to be a great danger

ill manage it yet he screeched got
the mixture too rich-too rich-too rich
what does he mean-mixture too rich
i asked captain blaine

ask him

my inquiring look brought an answer
from the professor

i-i-put too much of the-element that
caused the heal to form in the chemical-
going to vancouver for more-got to stop
it before it gets to the coast

we had to think fast i turned to cap-
tain blaine you have a faster ship-


wonder stories

but his plane is fitted to handle the
stuff-well run around and follow the
thing until he gets back and with that
blaine swung the little plane about and
headed for the vicinity of the hot spot

better report it to the office he sug-
gested

thats a joke i said the static even
down here interferes too much it has be-
come useless to try to talk hear nothing
but a crashing noise it will rain torrents
around the cloud of fire

my prediction was true when we again
came up with the sweeping sweltering thing
we saw that storm clouds had rushed into
its wake as darkness fell torrents of rain
beat upon the plane we changed our
course and fell in before it its speed was
slower now but a breeze caused by the
piled-up air in its rear was pushing it along
toward the coast i checked our position and
course and found that kind providence had
directed the thing to the south of nome
we came upon the coast before we realized
it and then what we feared began to hap-
pen everything within half a mile on
either side of the great cylindrical cloud
became scorched and directly beneath it
great trees withered became dry and blazed
a path of absolute destruction a mile wide
was being cut across the alaskan wilderness
and we were drifting toward the canadian
northwest

we must get ahead and warn verybody
shouted captain blaine he opened the
throttle wide and calculated the course of
the cloud i looked back at it in the gath-
ering darkness it took on a rose-colored
hue in the center its now ragged sides
were blue and green and gold like a rain-
bow what a magnificent thing it was
and how useful providing its elements were
not mixed wrongly knowing that i was
not likely to be familiar with the different
elements the nervous little professor had
simply explained that the mixture was too
rich

i could hardly contain myself for laugh-
ter at this pathetic little man who was so
frantic over the loss of control of his great
discovery i could imagine him screeching
orders at airport attendants in an effort to

rush some of those strange chemioals
abroad

we preceded the chemical cloud about
two miles but saw no sign of habi-
tation yet we knew that in our wake was
a strip a mile wide and many miles long
lying desolate because of this wild dream
of the little scientist we hoped he would
return quickly before three hours had
passed we were far inland the cloud
seemed to be disintegrating very slowly but
when we flew near it still cast off a swelter-
ing heat that drove us away again we
could do nothing but watch the progress of
this fool thing as it passed onward into
the interior

then came anxious moments we were
coming upon a canadian town blaine hew
over his siren open yelling through the
cabin window to the people in the streets
below ihe cloud was only three or four
miles away and headed directly for the cen-
ter of the village they only half under-
stood and yet they called others and looked
off to the west one family after another
took to planes some of them crowded and
overloaded but all of them managed to lift
from the tiny airport in the edge of the
town

something must be done immediately
said the captain as we watched the planes
take off the cloud was approaching the
town destroying everything in its wake we
flew about until the last plane had lifted and
then waited the thing came down upon
that village like a cyclone burning through
it and after leaving it a desolate wreck
veered off to the south toward a more thick-
ly populated area we dreaded to think
of what might happen next

we were flying about helpless fighting
the terrific air currents that resulted from
the heat we raced down over farm-
houses and opened the siren we rushed
to homes on both sides of the apparent
path of the thing and made all the noise
possible we landed at a village present-
ly some fifteen miles ahead of the cloud
and found the place deserted save for a
single police plane that sat on the tarmac
at the village port
the flaming cloud



we got it by radio explained the of-
ficer his red coat that had been quickly
buttoned reassured us and we hurried on-
ward we turned lo follow the cloud once
more just as we came upon it professor
metters plane caine burning the wind up
from the south we recognized the ship
by the number we saw as we played our
floodlight over it and then we saw the
brave little professors giant plane edge
into the top of that cloud saw a stream
of liquid come from the tube and fall into
the densest part of it saw it change from
its rosy-hue into a mild yellow from that
into a haze and finally into a bluish tint
we knew he had brought the cloud under
control

it is like getting ahead of the story to
have told you all this but it is the way it
happened to us professor metter ex-
plained it to us later as we ate a welcome
supper in a nearby roadside hotel

i had that fdea for years but it was
difficult to get the correct compound the
correct mixture of hydrogen and oxygen
and the other chemicals that go to the mak-
ing of this artificial atmosphere are cohe-
sive as you have seen i had a volatile al-
kaline base but i couldnt mix the elements
in the plane-thered be an explosion i
had to release one at a time from the dif-
ferent containers in the plane the idea is
all right youll agree why wherever the
wind blows that cloud for the next thirty
days people will have warm weather

an important looking man followed by
a crowd came up to our table and stood be-
fore the little professor

you have brought ruin upon farmers
across the entire country there are re-
ports of houses being burned-

was any one killed asked the excited
little man

no but youre going to face some big
damage suits said the man

the professor pondered a minute then
he looked up at the man and said not
far east of here lie the trackless wastes of
the canadian wilds the canadian govern-
ment was the first to become interested in
my experiments canadian statesmen are
responsible for what  have done thus far
they were interested because  promised an
eden of tropical lands where now glitter
the snowy stretches of the great northwest
i am sure we can repay all losses in land
there was a moment of stunned silence
a shout went up from the crowd cheers
shook the house they stopped when the
professors lips moved again

i can make a jungle out of the arctic
a land of steaming forests and banana plan-
tations there is no limit to the number
of chemical compounds dont you agree
that its a wonderful discovery he
twiddled his thumbs and smiled upon the
speechless throng

its an astounding invention all right
drawled blaine but how about that
plane of mine how did the stuff happen
to cut into lhat wing like a pair of scissors
and leave the rest of the ship intact
ill-ill pay for that-ill make it
right said the nervous little professor
i got the mixture too rich

by joseph kcnnclly

this is ihe storj of the almost incred-
ible sargasso sea mystery and of an
adventure which sounds a lillle mad but
which was actually based on a series of
facts thrilling and amazing to the entire
civilized world

lest readers of succeeding generations
attribute facts which follow to an unbrid-
led imagination it should be remembered
that the salient points in the narrative were
emblazoned across the front page of every
newspaper in the world when ihe expedi-
tion i am about to describe returned sev-
eral scientific books were also prepared
from data obtained during the adventure

as for my own part in this story i can
truthfully say it was inspired first by my
search for my sweetheart marna and sec-
ond by my natural love for indulging in

hazardous undertakings i had the pow-
erful double objective of trying to find the
girl i loved and aiding in solving a mys-
tery which piqued the curiosity of all who
were acquainted with it

the sargasso sea mystery like many
other events of major importance began
in a manner which excited passing but not
unusual interest the disappearance of the
marovia a freighter carrying a cargo of cof-
fee from rio de janeiro was the first link
in the chain of mystifying circumstances
prospects for the trip were favorable when
the marovia left port

when the freighter was two days out the
atlantic coast company the corporation
which owned the ship received a radio mes-
sage that all was well and that an excep-
tional time record was apt to be set on the


from the oceans depth
came the terrible threat
of doom and destruction

thin streamers of deep orange cut through the air like exploratory fingers
in our terror they were tentacles of some enemy

trip that was the last message ever re-
ceived from the ill-fated marovia

there was not even the customary s  s
of a vessel in distress the ship had ap-
parently disappeared from the face of the
ocean vessels in that vicinity could give
no information on the supposed disaster
the marovia had simply failed to reach its
berth in the east river new york no
clues were discovered in the official inves-
tigation ordered by the owning company
following the strange disappearance

at the lime the last radio message was
sent the marovia had been in the general
vicinity of the gulf stream she had last
been sighted in that vicinity by the island
queen whose captain noted the fact in the
ships log and gave the customary greeting



as the two vessels passed each other the
captain of the island queen perceived noth-
ing wrong in the appearance of the marovia

the disappearance of the freighter was
given front page attention in the metro-
politan dailies but the announcement was
not accompanied by the excitement aroused
by subsequent reports of lost vessels

uneasiness became apparent in maritime
circles when a second ship failed to make
port this time it was the st paul a
tropic navigation steamer outbound from
new york its destination was a central
american port again the last radio com-
munication from the ill-fated boat was re-
ceived just before she reached the gulf
stream it was a regular report stating
that all was well but it was the last word


wonder stories

the owners ever received from the ship and
its crew of twenty-four men

the probable fate of the two ships be-
came the topic of wide spread speculation
many persons wrote to the newspapers of-
fering possible explanations public dis-
cussion became so strong that the united
stales government sent a coast guard boat
to the scene of the two
mysterious disappear-
ances

not even a final
radio message herald-
ed the disappearance
of the coast guard
vessel and its crew of
eight

the affair had as-
sumed st-ious propor-
tions by that time

freight carriage be-
tween the united
states and the tropics
was suffering

as i look back on
that time of turbulence
in maritime circles it
seems that there was
a sort of regularity in
the way the boats
were reported missing

each was last heard
from in approximate-
ly the same gulf
stream location the
disappearance occur-
red at intervals of
about every seven
days not once was
an s o s picked up
by any of the stations
tuned in on the area

despite the fact
that traffic was considerably cut down on
ocean trails adjoining the mystery area a
total of thirty-four ships went to an un-
known fate in it

depredations if such they were be-
came so drastic that the countries
whose maritime shipping was involved by
international agreement forbade ships ven-
turing within a three-mile radius of the dan-

gerous territory special coast guard cut-
ters were assigned to the outer circle of the
radius to warn vessels and if necessary
force them to abide by the ruling a long
detour agreed upon by the countries whose
commerce was threatened provided a safe
but more costly and circuitous route

a special investigation board was formed
by the various ship
corporations but ef-
forts of the board were
fruitless

an attempt to solve
the mystery that at-
tracted wide spread
attention was the ex-
pedition fitted out by
the new york times
i cite it as an example
of what the press has
often done in the in-
terests of public safe-
ty-

there were t w o
ships in the times ex-
pedition it was
planned for them to
work independently
each was completely
outfitted w i t h the
most modern equip-
ment obtainable
much of tliis equip-
ment was donated by
sympathetic companies
and individuals

every known pre-
caution for sudden
emergencies was pro-
vided for in the equip-
ment naturally the
radio receiving and
sending sets were of
the most advanced types science could of-
fer one of the noteworthy features of the
communication system was the use of radio
beams the leaders of the times expedi-
tion were assisted in working out details of
the radio beam use by scientists from the
paldron institute

the radio beam had been experimented with
as far back as  but did not come into
general use until some years later

y ttithin the depths of
the seas reside some
of the most intriguing mys-
teries of nature as far
down as we have gone but
a few hundred feet we
have already discovered
strange forms of fish life-
life that has adjusted it-
self to the great pressure
and the sunlessness and
airlessness of the watery
deeps what might we find
at a depth of a mile or five
miles where the pressures
are terrific and the waters
intolerably cold man is
already attempting to find
out-for construction of a
diving equipment to go
down over a mile is on the
way

it is also possible that
some time in the remote
past a great cataclysm may
have changed the forma-
tion of the earth and the
seas depths and produced
a type of life totally
strange to us whether this
story deals with that prob-
lem we cannot tell - for
there is a corking good air
of mystery here that we
cannot spoil by too many
 hints	f
death from the seas



these radio beams there was one for each
ship operated from a land station located
on the florida coast the continuous
beam emanated from the land station and
maintained constant communication with
both ships the beam was registered on
tape ticker machines being located on both
vessels as well as at the land station thus
the slightest deviation from the true course
by either ship would be instantly noted
both by its companion craft and at the land
station

theoretically the radio beam idea was a
perfect method for maintaining constant
communication events following the start
of the expedition merely proved the fallacy
of placing entire faith in
a machine or a mechani-
cal arrangement

details were checked
and equipment thorough-
ly tested before the
times expedition left
new york radio com-
munication with the two
vessels was maintained
satisfactorily messages
being received many
times daily

the first piece of
startling news from the
expedition came when a
message was flashed to
new york stating that a
life boat from the 

paul had been found

the bodies of a man and a woman charred
beyond recognition were in the floating
hulk

in the midst of this startling message
communication was suddenly cut off with
the broadcasting ship the unfinished
message was picked up by several stations
radio beam communication from the ship
also ceased abruptly then the radio beam
from the second ship suddenly terminated
also a listening world was literally kept
gasping

both ships in the times expedition had
vanished as completely as had the other
crafts lost in that treacherous strip of sea
a seaplane dispatched from the florida

coast to search for possible wreckage on the
water might well have taken off for eternity
seen for the last lime winging out over the
sea the fate of the plane like that of the
ships remained unknown unlil the mystery
was finally cleared up

the times expedition has gone down in
history as a sincere but futile effort the
names of those who lost their lives have
been remembered in the monument erected
to their heroism at union square

you may think i am devoting too much
explanation to the expedition sent out by
the times but had it not been for that ex-
pedition i would never have become per-
sonally interested in the sargasso sea mys-
tery and with all modesty
i think i may add that
its secret would still be
locked in the ocean bos-
om

because marna mont-
gomery was aboard the
flag ship of the times
outfit and when mar-
na disappeared i would
have used whatever puny
strength i possess in
moving heaven and
earth if necessary to dis-
cover her fate and solve
the horrid mystery of the
sargasso

marna was a spirited
girl whose beauty was
matched by her impet-
uosity as a woman reporter on the times
she had had her share of journalistic thrills
but when plans for the times expedition to
the sargasso sea were announced marna
forthwith decided that the job covering
that undertaking was to be the crowning
jewel in her list of newspaper exploits

she would listen to no entreaties against
undertaking the perilous voyage but she
did agree that when she returned finis was
to be written on her professional career
she agreed then to become my wife and
settle down to the comparatively prosaic
task of juggling the salary of a wireless
telegrapher at the time i was serving on

wonder stories

the toltec which plied between new york
and cuba

imagine my anguish then when that last
radio message from the times expedition
was cut short for a time i thought i
would actually lose my mind then it was
that my company decided to sponsor a fin-
al effort to clear up the mystery i eager-
ly volunteered and because of my know-
ledge of wireless lelegraphv was accepted
lor the hazardous undertaking

the company was in really dire financial
straits as a result of the unexplained ocean-
ic tragedies eight of its best ships bad
gone into the maw of the sargasso their
loss had disrupted the freight-carrying sche-
dule and because immediate adjustments
bad been necessitated many of the most
profitable contracts had been lost then
too the cost of operation had been mater-
ially increased by the addition of the -
mile detour prescribed by the government

the route of the toltec did not quite
penetrate the forbidden area although
our course was near the scene of disaster
at that our proximity to that portion of the
sea aroused fearful apprehension on the
part of many of the sailors personally i
have never subscribed to the superstitions
of either land or sea i felt that there must
be some human agency or logical explana-
tion behind the disappearance

so when my company decided to make a
final desperate effort to solve the mystery
 pressed my claim as a member of the
party to be frank there were not many
volunteers and my personal interest in
solving the riddle aided me in securing one
of the two berths open

officials of the company had decided
against sending a large vessel into the area
they reasoned that this had been unsuccess-
ful in previous attempts and that a smaller
craft would probably have a better chance

the plan was outlined to me by mcand-
rews terminal superintendent at a confer-
ence of line officials to which i was sum-
moned

he explained

the plan we have finally decided upon

is to send a small motorboat carrying only
two men into the area

we shall take all possible precautions
to insure your safety but after you reach
the area the rest will depend on yourselves
he motioned to a silent figure half-con-
cealed by the shadows in one corner of the
room with a start  recognized novak
realization that i was to have that famous
adventurer as my companion added zest
to the affair

but mcandrews was continuing

we believe that you will have a good
chance as you will not be hampered with a
large vessel which may attract the attention
of your unknown enemy if there is an ene-
my

this simple plan may succeed where the
more elaborate attempts of others have
failed if it doesnt-well it means the fin-
ancial ruin of those who are left behind
after the plan had been thoroughly out-
lined to novak and myself we were given
an opportunity to change our minds if we
wished mcandrews and the others who
sat about ihe conference table impressed
upon us the dangerous nature of the mis-
sion and urged us to withdraw if we felt
any hesitancy in the matter

spurred on by eagerness to discover some
clue lo marnas fate i eagerly waived all
suggestions that it was not too late to with-
draw novak was equally determined lo
go in his strange career the unknown had
always exercised a peculiar fascination for
him a tragedy of his early manhood had
apparently robbed him of the desire to live
he had engaged in one mad adventure after
another always emerging with his ill-prized
life

mcandrews admonished

i must remind you that the chances of
your emerging alive from this undertaking
are absolutely against you

then finally he said do you still wish
to go

there was a moments silence in the
room

then i said i am perfectly willing to
take the risk adding there is only
one reason for hesitancy on my part
mcandrews asked quickly
death from the seas



what is that

i replied that is that my mother shall
suffer no financial embarrassment ii i am
lost

you need feel no worry on that score
mcandrews replied she will be well
provided for as long as she lives if you
fail to return

novak always a man of few words gave
an almost taciturn affirmative to mcand-
rews

as this time i think it opportune to tell
you something about novak as the com-
panys foreign representative he traveled al-
most constantly and was a familiar figure
in the picturesque ports of call on our lines
routes he had figured in several central
and south america peccadillos and had
weathered the storms of political intrigue
many times

more than six feet tall and of athletic
build he was a commanding figure al-
though reserved his mien was pleasant and
his personality attracted and held attention
wherever he went his indomitable
strength of character was reflected in pierc-
ing gray eyes and an aggressive profile
his blond hair was streaked with gray

varied adventure had punctuated his car-
eer even as a young man the countries to
the south of us had always interested him
and he had engaged in their turbulent poli-
tics to his later sorrow while in his ear-
ly twenties he had wooed and won a span-
ish girl noted for her beauty and intellect-
ual attainments they had removed to a
south american rancho presented to novak
by a grateful friend whom he had rendered
a valorous service

then revolution flamed across the coun-
try and novaks wife fell a victim to its
brutalities she was captured and her exe-
cution ordered by the revolutionary chief-
tain novak who was absent from home at
the time attributed the cold blooded mur-
der to personal malice directed toward him-
self

a short time later the governors palace
resounded to the shrieks of servants who dis-
covered that the revolutionary leader and
his entire family had fallen victim to a
wift and little known poison the multi-

ple murder was never conclusively proven
to have been done by novak although the
crime was generally acknowledged and even
applauded in some circles as a just revenge

chapter ii
the derelict

the united states government was
quick to oiler its aid to the company
for the perilous undertaking navy sea-
planes were stationed at our florida coast
base and other aids offered us

we flew from new york to florida both
novak and myself were quiet and thought-
ful on the trip we did not attempt much
conversation partly due to our own in-
clinations and partly due to the monotonous
roar of the three powerful diesel engines
our plane was powered with

fantastic thoughts and improbable theor-
ies flashed through my mind on that trip
theories which i had seen advanced in the
columns of science fiction story magazines
permeated my mind and i toyed with var-
ious ideas inspired by these stories of which
i had read many and tried to adapt them to
the problem at hand novak appeared to
be sunk in an introspective mood

the plane winged south at a fast clip
air travel was no novelty to me and i took
slight interest in the panoramic vistas which
unfolded beneath us in fact with the pros-
pect of our great adventure before me the
flight proved rather boresome and  sighed
and stretched with relief when we deplaned
at key west

an official united states army car met
us at the air field and took us to the dock
where a coast guard boat was awaiting us
we boarded the cutter and soon were on our
way to the edge of the forbidden area there
our motor boat was lowered over the side
and we bade those aboard the cutter a sober
farewell

our motor boat was a small compactly
built craft it had two small cabins of cub-
by hole proportions a heavy sea would

the author of an article on novaks colorful
career which appeared in the new republic

have speedily capsized our floating home
but as the tropical storm season was past
we had little to fear in the way of weather
food and fuel sufficient for a months cruise
were on board although we hoped to satis-
factorily end our mission in much less time
than that

when we shook hands with officers aboard
the coast guard boat it was apparent that
they never expected to see us alive again
we were serious naturally and the good-
byes of our companions were almost dis-
heartening

soon we were flashing through the spark-
ling sea and thoughts of death and danger
semed far away as we reveled in the mo-
tion of the smoothly performing boat our
motors there were two vibrated gently and
soon we were in ihe midst of the dreaded
area the v edge of our bow cut the
water like a knife and sent pearly cascades
of water back in a delicate shower

 was at the wheel we had worked out
a plan whereby we would stand three-hour
tricks at the wheel during the daylight hours
and float at night ast we had no particular
goal and could ascertain our position at
any time by instruments this plan was cal-
culated to conversed our strength for the
vigilant search we planned to make

we cruised about ihe area all of that first
day noting nothing unusual i began to
penetrate novaks shell of taciturnity and
discover the qualities that cemented our
lasting friendship the loneliness of our
surroundings the nature of our mission and
the sense-quickening qualities of being in
a death defying adventure together rapidly
ripened our association from superficial to
deep friendship

on the third day out we discovered our
first clue it was also the first actual inti-
mation of the amazing incredible adventure
which befell us

i was standing at the bow scanning the
horizon while novak stood his turn at the
wheel the monotonous vista i was gazing
at was at once dismal and disgusting

much of this portion of the sea was cov-
ered with a weed from which a nauseating
stench arose the thick greenish scum
which i characteristic of the sargasso

alone covered the sea weed the odor was
an abominable one in fact it was all but
unbearable i do not consider myself a
squeamish person but that retching smell
all but made me ill

our very food seemed permeated by it
and the consumption of meals became an
almost unbearable ordeal

on this particular day as i stood at the
bow  was reflecting on the vagaries of ihe
human mind i thought of the inadequate
existence most of us lead immersed in self-
ish desires sating them engaging in war-
fare less human than that waged by the
lower animals and withal complacently
contented with ourselves pictures of our
self-important business men the executives
in our big cities occurred to me and 
thought how insignificant their might was
when compared to that of nature

thoughts of this kind usually lead to bit-
ter introspection and then develop into a
morbid contemplation of our daily existence
which is detrimental in a mental sense this
psychological phenomena is interesting and
absolutely true as any student of the science
will tell you i was deeply buried in self-
pitying introspection when an excited sound
from novak brought me out of my reverie
with a start

glancing up my startled gaze encountered
the looming bulk of the nearly unrecogniz-
able hull of the marovia the first ship which
had disappeared in the sargasso sea

she was tipped sluggishly to one side
and rolling slightly her sides were
charred and encrusted with green scum the
sides and hull looked as though fierce fire
had swept them yet the masts stanchions
and cargo booms were untouched the
steel sides appeared to have borne the brunt
of the devasting flame

but the phenomena i hat later aroused my
excited cry was not immediately noted by
me when my roving gaze did rest on it
i gasped it was this the entire bow of
the vessel from rail to waterline and from
the end of the wrell deck through the fore-
castle was one mass of fused metal

it looked as though some shaft of super-
heat like veritable fingers from hell had
death from the seas



reached out and melted the metal in the
ship the vastness of the destruction was
appalling i knew that no instrument known
to the world could wreak such havoc i

i	shuddered at thoughts too horrible to
voice

novak and i stood speechless a cold
sweat had broken out on us

finally novak regained a measure of his
composure and said

i guess wed better board her

although the prospect was temporarily
unnerving to me  borrowed from novaks
calm and prepared to aid him in pulling
our boat alongside the spectral marovia

it had become increasingly difficult for
our craft to move through the water before
we spied the wrecked ship and it was with
real difficulty that we forced our small boat
through the clinging fields of sea weed and
finally pulled up against the marovia ty-
ing our craft to what had once been the
anchor chain of the stricken boat we be-
gan clambering up its side

more than once i cursed to myself during
that climb jagged pieces of splintered
steel tore at my flesh and clothing novak
as usual stood the ordeal with fortitude

my audible sigh of relief when we reach-
ed the deck sounded strangely loud on that
freighter which once had proudly plowed
through gale swept seas

wed better take a look at the deck and
the staterooms first novak suggested

there was nothing on the deck or
bridge to arouse comment then we started
a tour of the staterooms as you know
every freighter has a few staterooms re-
served for the use of infrequent passengers
and company officials

in every cabin we found the same condi-
tion floors had been ripped up and walls
demolished the significant fact was that
while apparently nothing else had been
taken every bit of steel was gone

a ghastly revelation awaited us at the
end of the deck those aboard had evident-
ly fled for protection to the last stateroom
and barricaded the door against some ene-
my unknown to us this door had evident-
ly been literally burned from its hinges
although constructed of thin sheet metal it

apparently had been an easy matter to pene-
trate it with a weapon powerful enough to
inflict the damage we had already noted on
the steel bow and other parts of the ship

huddled in the far corner of the room
were the pitiful remains of the ill-starred
crew and passengers charred corpses
burned to a crisp were piled in a grotesque
heap

softly cursing novak surveyed the hor-
rible scene

finally in an awed voice i asked how
do you explain it

the only theory i could advance is still
hazy novak replied i must find more
corroborating evidence before attributing it
to more than distorted imagination

then after a moment of thought-

i will say this much though because it
is proven by the evidence before our eyes
a heat ray of some kind is involved in this
tragedy

look at the condition of the ships bow
this door and those motioning to the pile
of bodies that is the only way those things
can be explained

i had somewhat the same thought
novak i admitted but it seemed so fan-
tastic i hesitated to voice it

thoughtfully novak replied the idea at
first seems improbable to us because it is a
radical departure from anything we are
familiar with but the use of a powerful
heat ray is no new idea in the scientific
world as far back as  the possibility
of such a ray was mentioned and experi-
mented with unsuccessfully

a german made progress with the idea
in  and did actually develop a ray of
comparatively small effectiveness he kill-
ed rats guinea pigs and small animals dur-
ing his experiments

in a reverse manner the ray was used
to promote the growth of vegetables with
a milder application than that used on the
animals he was able to cut in half the time
usually required for a tree lo mature

you have heard of the vibratory ray
which wrecked the harvard laboratories in
 killing all those who knew the secret
of the invention

to explain the theory in a simple way


wonder stories

i -will cite tte well known fact that a sub-
stance the size of a football heated to
the surface temperature of the sun would
shrivel any human being or inanimate ob-
ject within a radius of a half-mile

ow suppose you had a fragment of
- jin such a substance and put it in a
tube insulated at all points except a small
opening in the front thus the heat could
travel out of the tube in only one direction
namely the front

assume too that by pressing a tiny but-
ton you could set into operation apparatus
that would heat this theoretical fragment
to the temperature necessary for your pur-
pose the operator would thus be able to
control aim and fire at will at the same
time he would be adequately protected by
the insulation

the result would be a weapon so ef-
fective that any nation having it would be
able to dominate the world it would be
the deciding factor in any war now i be-
lieve something similar to this theoretical
rav i have been describing has been used
here

he paused leaving me gaping in wonder

finally motioning to the mute group i
asked who do you think is responsible
for this wholesale destruction

your guess is as good as mine novak
replied so far as i can see nothing has
been removed from the ship but steel why
all these lives should have been taken i
dont know there was no mercenary ad-
vantage to the attackers as the ship carried
no bullion the cargo has been left un-
touched as you can see

a nation seeking to ruin our marine com-
merce would not operate in this manner
besides many vessels have been lost which
belonged to countries other than ours no
bob i am afraid our solution lies else-
where

this rather excited conversation had been
carried on as we stood beside that pitiful
pile of dead now our thoughts came back
to it

we can at least give them a decent bur-
ial novak suggested

a search for canvas revealed that and

some strong cord in the ships storeroom
returning with the canvas and cord we be-
gan the ghastly task of sewing the bodies
into individual sacks and weighting them
twilight was on us before we finished so
we decided to postpone the actual burial
until morning

although we made a brave attempt nei-
their of us at much that night and i must
confess we slept but little rising early we
prepared to finish our self-appointed grue-
some task

while novak prepared our breakfast i
decided to look over the wireless appar-
atus on the ship i wanted to find out why
the operator had not sent out an sos in
the face of such imminent danger

looking over the equipment i found
everything to be in perfect order so far
as i could discover the wireless apparatus
was functioning smoothly i got a satisfac-
tory spark in testing the set and decided
that whatever disturbance had interfered
with the sending of a message had been only
temporary

i thought of sending a message out over
the set but hesitated for fear whatever enemy
was responsible for the condition of the
marovia might pick up the code

after a breakfast devoid of conversation
novak and i went forward with the burial
he had found a bible in the captains cabin
and read from it as the solemn intonations
of novaks voice pronounced the scriptural
passages he had selected i let the bodies
slide over the rail one by orte into the
placid water

after the last body had been lowered to
its watery grave we stood with bowed heads
for a moment the sunshine was stream-
ing down on us but it failed to lighten the
gloom of our spirits the water which had
engulfed more than a score of bodies ceas-
ed to gurgle and as it became calm again
a large field of greenish sea grass floated
over the fatal spot

chapter iii

fingers of doom

following the emotional strain of
the burial neither novak nor myself
death from the seas



felt like continuing our explorations that
day we had previously tied our motor boat
to the side of the marovia and by tacit
agreement remained there that day

we were standing in the bow of the
marovia discussing our next move i
broached the idea of continuing our search
for the other lost vessels but novak vetoed
this suggestion pointing out that we had by
no means completely examined the derelict
we were aboard

suddenly i noticed novak grow tense as
though some sight or sound had aroused
his suspicion he thrust a warning hand
on my arm as i started to speak then i
heard it too

a low humming whirr which rose rapidly
to a high pitched whine the very air seem-
ed to vibrate with the unusual force of the
sound it seemed to be coming from the
side of the ship and beneath it

cautiously creeping to the side of the
marovia i peered overboard at first i saw
nothing then i noticed a queer and un-
natural effulgence coming up from the
murky depths of the ocean

some phosphorescent object seemed to be
coming to the surface the water began to
boil and i saw that a circle of clear water
was rapidly widening as the sea weed and
other surface material was forced back

then i saw it rising out of the water
its phosphorescent sides dripped with wa-
ter similar in some ways to a submarine
it had the same elongated shape with a
fuller looking tower that alone marred the
symmetry of its smooth lines there were
no ballast tanks along the sides either

the motors ceased their eerie whine as
the thing rose to the top of the water a
curious silence followed

i cannot with mere words describe the
queer machine i beheld it was larger than
a submarine and its entire outer surface was
covered with a series of scales similar to
those found on a fish the scale-like cover-
ing produced the phosphorescence i had
first noted yet there was no sign of aquatic
life in the object it was unquestionably a
machine powered with some type of motor
strange to us

the queer craft came to a halt except for

a gentle rocking back and forth occasioned
by the waves then a section of the top slid
back with a grating noise

novak hissed in my ear

hide god knows what is in there

instantly i whirled and with novak close
behind me ran towards the middle of the
boat our running feet made a reverberat-
ing sound on the empty deck and the next
moment i was cursing our folly at having
forgotten that continuing though we
dived into hiding behind a pile of tarpaulin
slung carelessly into a heap on the deck

crouching there we heard a shrill whistle
the sound resembled the siren on a fire
truck more than anything else i could as-
sociate it with

peering from our hiding place we noticed
a blue radiance which slowly became visible
in the air about us it rapidly grew in out-
line and began to assume a definite shape
benumbing fear sent fingers of ice to con-
strict my heart	

the radiance continued to grow in in-
tensity until a well defined aura of blue
flame enveloped the entire ship there was
a charged feeling in the air as though elec-
tricity might be the force back of the phen-
omena

gradually the aura of blue flame began to
localize and change to a deep purple hue it
was a magnificent display of force for which
i had no doubt there was a perfectly natur-
al origin or explanation

every color in the spectrum now became
apparent thin streamers of a deep orange
color cut through the air like exploratory
fingers they wavered groping toward the
the dim corners of the deck they almost
seemed possessed of an intelligence of their
own as they slid along the rail as if in
search of something

in our terror it seemed to us they were
tentacles of some malignant enemy reach-
ing out to find us i gasped involuntarily
as the full force of that idea struck me

blind unreasoning fear began to flow
through my veins and pervade my very be-
ing shivering violently i crouched lower
then the scene began to turn black it
seemed to me that a veritable sash of crepe


wonder stories

was falling across my son i in the com-
plete absence of light the darkness itself
seemed to be possessed of substance

the darkness lifted for a moment all
was quiet and then i heard novak cry
out his hoarse scream sounded distant and
unreal it ended abruptly as though some
antagonistic hand had reached out and
throttled him

lurid light was shed on the deck for an
instant by a brilliant purple flash which
caused me to fall back by that time i felt
as if the foundations of my sanity were
reeling i seemed to be living a horrible
inconceivable nightmare

then i realized that the flash had seared
me scorching my hair brows and
lashes and all but burning the clothes from
my body

i screamed and heard no sound i beat
my hands in futility against my breast and
felt agonizing pain as a result i had a
mad impulse to throw myself over the rail

rising to follow that impulse which to
my disordered mind seemed a desirable end
to my horrid dream i felt something cold
and clammy clinging to me i also had a
burning sensation in my back not unlike
that produced by contact with certain kinds
of fish which have the power of inflicting
terrible electric burns

terrible pain shot through the small of
my back then i stumbled with outflung
arms and sank into the depths of merciful
oblivion 

 seemed to be floating on air there was
a curious feeling of elation in my body
briefly as i regained consciousness the
menial predominated over the physical
then i became aware of my aches and pains
i saw that one of my arms was blackened
and blistered pain was coursing through
my entire body in a steady unceasing
rhythm i cried out involuntarily and al-
most fainted from the pain

through the mists that were beginning
to clear before my eyes i saw novak look-
ing down at me anxiously

where are we  managed to gasp

novak admonished me to lie quietly for
a few momenta

my eyes wandered about and i noticed
i was in a fairly large bed the room was
small and furnished in an unimaginative
fashion which was depressing there were
no splashes of color no attempts at beauty
in the room everything was in a low
monotonous brown hue the ceiling was
low being barely six feet i judged and the
whole room seemed to be swaying gently

a dim blue light which seemed to be the
rooms sole illumination exuded from the
ceiling though not localized at any de-
finite point the floor had a fluffy cover-
ing not unlike cotton in its natural state
which was in the prevailing shade of brown

novaks voice a he talked had a strain-
ed quality which i attributed to the evident
sound proof qualities thal had been used
in the construction of the room i focused
my wandering thoughts on what he was say-
ing

-afler i screamed i felt something on
my face then i lost consciousness and
when i awoke i was lying on that bed with
you

once after i regained consciousness i
saw a section of the wall slide back and
some kind of a robot entered the room
somewhat on the type of eros and those
other robots exhibited at haddon hall not
long ago it left food here and later re-
turned with a bottle of something that tasted
like some kind of brandy i forced some
of the liquid down your throat you revived
-and here we are

but how long have we been here i
inquired weakly

i regained consciousness several hours
ago but of course i do not know how long
i remained unconscious novak replied

what are we going to do i asked im-
patiently for all we know we may be
headed toward the bottom of the ocean

you have diagnosed our course better
than you think novak smiled grimly see
what i discovered a while ago

approaching the far wall he pressed a
button invisible to me the wall slid back
revealing an outer transparent wall such as
those used in the submarines of the paldron
institute sub-sea research department

i managed to stagger over and press my
death from the seas



forehead against this wall the water was
flashing by on the outside and showed that
we must be traveling at a high rate of
peed how high i had no means of cal-
culating

afraid to believe what t could plainly
see i retorted nonsense perhaps we are
just below the water line

no you saw it when it rose out of the
water novak replied quietly it is un-
doubtedly a submersible of some kind then
too there have been several times when i
could plainly tell that we were descending
at a sharp angle

but whats it all about i asked desper-
ately 

the lord only knows but we have cer-
tanly bumped into something we are entirely
unacquainted with or prepared for

we continued to thrash about conver-
sationally in search of a satisfactory theory
for our situation when suddenly a low
sound warned us we were no longer alone
turning  surveyed the man who had en-
tered

in stature he was short almost to the
point of being a dwarf his legs were
almost ridiculously small and undeveloped
his hands too were abnormally small as
was his torso

his head attracted my attention it was
enormous in comparison with the rest of
his body his broad forehead sloped back
to a head which was entirely without hair
a pair of extraordinarily large and brilliant
eyes gazed at us the entire impression i
gained was that of a super-normal intel-
lect

motioning with a withered and shrunken
hand for us to follow he turned to leave
the room i stood irresolute until novak
set the example i seemed to look to him
instinctively for guidance wtien he took
the initial step toward the aperture i fol-
lowed

we walked down a low hall which was
barely wide enough for our passage even
single file the ceiling of this hall was even
lower than that in the room we had just
left

thus we walked until we came to an ob-

struction then our silent guide pulled
a lever which operated a portcullis-like ar-
rangement as it dropped behind us we
heard a sigh not unlike that caused by the
escape of highly compressed air

next we passed through a group of small
rooms evidently used for passenger-cabins
and store rooms finally we emerged into
whal must have been the central room of the
vessel

the room was large in fact much larger
than you expect to find on a ship of any
kind it was brilliantly lighted also the
light was the same blue as that in our room
but emanated from two tubular rods fixed
to the ceiling by metal clamps the light
streamed down revealing in pitiless detail
every object in the room

thirty or more of the strange-looking
men were seated in a row of chairs arrang-
ed horseshoe fashion in the hollow of
the semi-circle were two vacant chairs tlie
old man who had acted as our guide motion-
ed us to be seated in them

we sank down into deep cushions side
by side our elbows touching and waited
for the next step in this strange drama

chapter iv
the council

glancing about i noticed with a shud-
der of apprehension that every couni
tenance in that room was the same the
faces of our captors were so identical that
they might have been cast from the same
mold

i had no time to speculate on that though
as one of the queer creatures advanced to-
ward novak and myself and began adjust-
ing helmet-like arrangements on our heads

these helmets were fitted with electrodes
and mouthpieces and were attached to a com-
plicated looking machine in the center of
the room by wires one of our captors
stationed himself at this machine

a distinct click sounded through the
room and then a metallic sounding voice
began to speak

i would advise you to sit still and listen
quietly you are in no immediate danger

then the voice continued


wonder stories

you are probably interested most in
where you are this is a vessel from daar
the sunken city it is the first ship sent
from the lower world to the surface of the
sea in search of borite

novak interrupted with a question to
which the voice replied

borite is known lo your world as a chem-
ical element in ours it is called a primary
again novak made a query to which the
reply was

the atomic weight of borite is 
that is what we know as iron novak
exclaimed

i thought of the marovia and its missing
metal lining

may i ask what you want with borite
novak continued

for use in a vibratory heat ray which
when properly handled is a powerful wea-
pon of warfare the voice replied

we were to learn more about that ray
within a short time

the voice continued and next launched
into a brief history of daar the city to
which we were being taken and its inhab-
itants

later we learned that the method of com-
munication between our captors and our-
selves was an intricate arrangement for the
transfer of thoughts they were not actual-
ly speaking to us at all the apparatus
made it possible for any one in the room to
consciously send a thought to or receive
a thought from any one else in the room

unusual facts about daar were related by
the spokesman during the remainder of
the council we learned that the city had
once existed above sea level on a continent
not unlike those of the world from which
novak and i came

the race inhabiting daar was the supreme
one of the continent then a series of earth-
quakes began crumbling the earth and as
the cataclysms increased in intensity it be-
came apparent that daar was slowly sinking
into the sea

scientists of the city devoted their skill
to the problem of saving the race to have
constructed enough boats to save the popu-
lation would have required years whereas

the most optimistic calculations gave the
city but a few more weeks of existence

a scheme of salvation was perfected by
dobeer one of the nations most learned
scientists the result was the erection of
an anti-gravitational machine which nuuli-
fied the weight of the ocean thus as the
supposedly doomed city slowly sunk be-
neath the waves of the ocean it was encased
in walls of weightless water

so daar became a mighty city located on
dry land beneath the sea isolated from
communication with other worlds the daar-
ians devoted themselves to the study of
science with amazing results

waste materials such as are discarded
in our world were utilized to the fullest pos-
sible extent synthetic food was but one
of the marvels of everyday life atomic
energy also was utilized in many ways to
aid in supporting life in the city

those were the salient facts imparted to
us during that queer conversation in the
council hall of our captors it appeared
that the meeting had been called more for
the purpose of supplying us with informa-
tion than to obtain any information from
us

after the meeting metoor one of the coun-
cillors was assigned to us as a guide and
in succeeding days took us on inspection
trips to various parts of the submersible

the engine room was the most unbeliev-
able feature of the ship to me i had pic-
turned it to myself as being filled with mas-
sive machinery my surprise was complete
therefore when i found that its most prom-
inent feature was a small circular table
which stood on three legs in the center ol
the room

a large globe surmounted this table this
globe was surrounded by smaller ones which
glowed alternately in weird fashion and
rising from the cluster of globes was a long
slender tube this tube emitted the high
pitched whine we had heard so often the
display of colors and dynamic force given
off by this delicate apparatus caused the
room to resemble a scientific laboratory
more than the power room of a vessel

surely that tube doesnt furnish the
power which drives this ship i exclaimed
death from the seas



but it does metoor responded an
infinitesimal sliver of steel is in that tube
when the atoms in the steel are broken up
intra-atomic energy is produced which fur-
ishes the propelling power for the ship

utjow do you release that power

x a novak asked

our guide explained

the steel is held in the middle of the
tube by two clamps a current of electric-
ity of a high potential passes through it
projecting a stream of electrons from the
bottom of the tube to the vibratory ray
which bombards the electrons of the steel
atoms the balance is thus disrupted and
the proton released stores of energy at-
taining titanic proportions are thus avail-
able

another question of novaks was in re-
gard t the method of controlling the verti-
cal and horizontal movements of the vessel

metoor replied

that is accomplished by means of a
weight reducing and increasing machine
in other words an invention similar to the
anti-gravitational machnie you have heard
about by increasing the weight of the ship
we are able to sink and also to withstand
the terrific pressure of the lower ocean
depths

by the opposite use of the machine we
can decrease weight in fact we can lighten
the vessel until it actually weighs less than
the atmosphere that is what we have to
do when we emerge from the water and en-
ter our own city

we passed through the other parts of the
ship in rapid succession the living quar-
ters of the councillors were at the back of
the ship there were storerooms there al-
so in which we saw piles of steel trimmings

looking at those mute reminders of the
terrible catastrophes on top of the sea i
wondered what lay ahead of us in daar

daar

having no means for calculating time
i do not know how long our journey
jn the submersible lasted

one day metoor summoned novak and me

to the council chamber and pushing back aj
panel in the wall said

look

we were floating above a large city

as we gazed in astonished awe metoori
said

the city of daar

our craft landed in much the same man-
ner a huge dirigible is brought down it
was anchored on the flat roof of a largo
building with the manual labor being per-
formed by robots who were almost human
in appearance the mechanism operating
them must have been almost perfect

the scene was one of bustling activity
metoor remained by our sides until landing
operations were completed and then led
us from the machine

there will be a meeting of the council-
lors this afternoon which you will attend
he told us

until that time we were left more or less
to our own devices with one of the coun-
cillors acting as a guide or as we suspected
as guard

a superficial survey of daar revealed that
it was laid out in accordance with the
radial plan of city building in the upper
world the buildings were practically uni-
form in size and were arranged so that they
led toward a square or park which appeared
to be a public meeting place of some kind

architecturally the buildings tended to-
ward the massive and utilitarian style each
was surmounted by a tall gray spire which
in turn supported a glittering globe these
domes pointed toward the dim wall above
which we knew to be the ocean wall

in the center of the square or park where
the buildings terminated there was a tall
fence surrounding a spire larger than any
in the city this building housed the anti-
gravitational apparatus we later learned

anti-gravitational emanations from that
tall spire held the ocean back and insured
the safety of the city

despite the oddities of the city novak and
i were conccntrating more on thoughts of
the council meeting than on the strange
sights surrounding us we felt that our
fate probably depended on that meeting at
the very least we hoped to discover some


wonder stories

clue as to the reason for oar capture and
transportation to daar

impatiently therefore we waited for the
summons which came in due time calling
us to the meeting in the council chamber
we found a large group of men awaiting us
who were identical in appearance lo those
we had seen on the submersible

metoor was the spokesman for the group
and after our headpieces had been adjusted
he plunged immediately into the subject

we are facing a grave national crisis
he began the borite we have obtained is
insufficient for our purpose we want you
to guide us to a spot on the surface of the
sea where we can be sure of obtaining
more

novak spoke for us and in a series of dis-
creet questions discovered that the daariana
were badly disappointed in the small amount
of iron obtained from the ship they had de-
stroyed they had hoped to obtain much
greater quantities of the valuable substance

naturally we were not inclined to league
ourselves with these strange creatures
against our own people so we disclaimed
any knowledge of where they might be sure
of obtaining greater quantities of steel

the councillors were quite frank in out-
lining their needs to us they seemed to
consider us harmless in hurting their en-
terprise we discovered that a struggle for
supremacy was in process between two op-
posing factions in the sub-sea metropolis

the group with whom we were perforce
allied were the hereditary rulers of daar
although they numbered only  in a pop-
ulation of about  persons they had
held undisputed sway until a short time be-
fore their commands were enforced by
thousands of robots created by the council-
lors and capable of carrying out any instruc-
tions they were given

we learned that celibacy was maintained
among the councillors and that their number
remained the same always all of them
were bred from an artificially fertilized
female who was selected every  years
from among the masses that explained
their standardization in face and form

the general population known as the
masses had submitted to this dictatorship

until a short time before when threats of

an uprising began to spread the masses
it seemed were tired of their life of servi-
tude and planned to overthrow the council-
lors construct enough submersibles for the
purpose and escape to the upper world

this much we learned before being dis-
missed from tlie council metoor then in-
formed us that guides would take us for a
more extended tour of the city than we had
yet enjoyed we were told that we need
have no fear in visiting the various parts of
the city as the plans of the masses were as
yet secret and supposedly unknown to the
councillors

novak had characteristically decided that
he preferred to see the scientific laboratories
of daar first while i wished to tour the
city generally as we waited for our guides
we heard a sigh of compressed air that
signaled the opening of a door leading to
the elevator or pneumatic-tube arrange-
ment which connected the different build-
ings in daar

we turned in rather uninterested fashion
and then it seemed for a moment that my
heart stopped beating the next moment
it was racing trip-hammer fashion

in the door beside one of the men of
daar stood marna

she stood transfixed with surprise too

her jet black hair cascaded down and
partially covered her white shoulders her
blue eyes which had a tinge of violet in
them were opened wide in astonishment
and her lips were parted

the tight-fitting white garment she wore
accentuated the symmetrical lines of her
figure indeed to my startled eyes she look-
ed like the vision of a greek statue come to
life

then after a brief moment of amazement
i stiffened and pretended not to know her
bu with our eyes we spoke volumes and
only when the guide left us alone for a
moment did we embrace and seated marna
and i began a mutual explanation of what
we knew about our situation and how we
happened to be where we were

mamas story was much like mine the
times boat on which she had been a passen-
death from the seas



ger had been attacked in much the same
way novak and i had been overcome on
the marovia

the fearful rays had flashed over the boat
spreading death and destruction marna
lost consciousness and when she revived
found herself among the strange crew on
the daarian boat apparently she was the
only person on any of the attacked boats
whose life had been spared why this was
she did not know but on the return trips
the daarian boat made to the surface of the
sea no one else had been brought back ex-
cept novak and myself

the men on the submersible had treated
her with a respect and almost a homage
that had led marna to believe her capture
was in accordance with some plan but so
far she had been able to learn nothing about
tje reason for her preservation at a time
when all others were suffering a horrible
death

marna had been accorded full freedom
and whenever possible her slightest wish
in daar had been granted as there was
no possible chance for her escape she had
gone wherever she wished natural curi-
osity had prompted her to thoroughly ex-
plore the peculiarities of the city as a re-
sult she was almost as familiar with the
city as the daarians themselves

in summoning her as one of her guides
metoor had played what he thought would
be a waggish trick by suddenly confronting
us with one of our own race how little
he had guessed what that discovery meant
to me

needless to say atoor the daarian ac-
companying marna summarily became
novaks guide to the laboratories while
marna and  departed for a happy tour of
the remainder of the city

we bade novak and atoor a temporary
good-bye as marna led the way to a corner
of the room where she pressed a hidden but-
ton a door flew open revealing a tiny
cushioned elevator we entered and began
our pleasurable trip together

marna took delight then and later in
showing me her superior knowledge of the
ways of daar and we had many hearty
laughs as she guided me about the city

after entering the elevator marna manipu-
lated a lever a light glowed at the top
and i felt an almost sickening acceleration
the elevator came to a easy halt within a
few minutes and stepping from it we found
ourselves on a balcony overlooking a broad
street

the thoroughfare beneath us was paved
with a hard looking white stone which was
similar to marble in appearance throngs
of people were jostling each other about
in the crowded street i immediately notic-
ed the lack of any type of vehicular traffic
yet this was not such a strange situation
when you considered that the city at its
widest point was only six miles across

vehicles for transportation through the
streets would have constituted a public
nuisance due to the crowded condition of
the city thinking of our traffic tangles in
the upper world  could not help smiling
and giving the daarians another of those
mental salutes i was getting in the habit of
bestowing on them as  became better ac-
quainted with their ideas

we stood on the balcony a short time
surveying the scene and listening to the
snatches of inane conversation which float-
ed up to us the masses conversed together
freely and only the councillors used the
method of thought transference in place of
using their voices

in rapid succession we visited the places
of importance in daar marna gave de-
scriptions of the points of interest and laugh-
ingly compared herself to the ballyhoo
spielers of the rubber neck wagons in the
big cities at home

chapter v
the crisis	

the presence of mama in daar acceler-
ated the half formed plans novak and
 had already made for our escape

we attempted in frantic fashion to per-
fect a plan for eluding the councillors and
leaving daar the impending crisis in the
city served as a spur to our efforts

but it seemed that we were caught in a
trap from which there was no chance of
escape


wonder stories

our only hope is to gain control of the
submersible some way i told novak one
day

easier said than done im afraid he
responded how are you going to get by
the guard

thats what is worrying me i replied

a guard of heavily armed robots was on
duty at all times they were directed by a
councillor who was always on guard with
them the councillors were afraid that the
opposing faction might seek to gain control
of the vessel

an ominous calm seemed to be deepening
over the city during those anxious day the
population went about its daily tasks as usu-
al in the factories and laboratories of daar

but revolution was brewing secretly and
the situation was becoming more acute
every day we learned from metoor the
masses were merely biding their time waiting
for the word from monas their leader be-
fore striking

the work of insulating the vibratory guns
with which the councillors planned to repel
an open attack was being hurried as rapidly
as possible

novak and i were permitted a great deal
of liberty and with marna kept our eyes
and ears open as we wandered about daar
but in spite of our efforts we seemed no
nearer a solution of our problem

metoor continued his friendly interest in
us although we saw but little of him as he
hurried from one conference to another and
between times visited the factory where the
heat ray guns were being prepared

the masses had been kept in ignorance
of the development of this ray and all the
manual labor of insulation was being done
by robots who obeyed the mental impulses
of the councillors in charge of the factory

one day i gathered courage to ask metoor
a question

metoor why was marna alone spared
of all those aboard the vessels you destroy-
ed in your search for borite

he replied almost carelessly we will
use her instead of a woman from the masses
when the time arrives next for replenishing
our councillors in that way we will show

the masses how unimportant they are to
our welfare

concealing my agitation i made some
noncommital reply and thanked whatever
instinct had warned me o tell marna not
to betray the fact that we were sweethearts
if the councillors had guessed that we were
even acquainted in the upper world they
would probably have imprisoned marna or
at least refused to let us spend so much time
together

day by day the atmosphere seemed to
grow more strained in daar

bob i believe we could gain control
of the submersible if we could get rid of
the councillor who directs the guard
novak said one day

thats right i exclaimed as the full
force of the idea struck me without the
councillor the robots are helpless they
depend entirely on the mental directions
given them

whats that novak asked sharply as a
shrill siren began sounding through the
city

marna answered

that is a signal for the people to gather
at the council hall

curious to discover the cause of the alarm
we joined the throngs of daarians who were
hastening to the park-like enclosure about
the council hall

by george monas has called this meet-
ing not the councillors i exclaimed as we
neared our destination

it was the determined looking leader of
the masses who stood on a balcony prepar-
ing to address the crowd

my people he began in a thundering
voice i have called you together to tell
you of the villainous plans of the council-
lors

an angry murmur rose from the crowd

we have just discovered their plans for
exterminating the masses of daar with a
powerful heat ray gun they plan to use
the gun against us unless we continue to
obey them monas continued our only
means of protection is to seize the factory
where these guns are being made

the roar of the crowd was almost deafen
death from the seas



ing as the daarians signified their assent to
the plan

then suddenly another voice was heard
booming out above the noise of the crowd

metoor stood on an opposite balcony
i warn you people of daar that an
attempt against the councillors will seal
your doom he shouted it is impossible
for you to withstand the heat ray gun or
seize the factory

in a tremendous shout the people re
sponded

down with the councillors

then the multitude took up the cry to
the factory to the factory

suddenly novak clutched my arm and
hissed look

a well aimed flame of blue was shooting
through the air it was directed from a
window in the council hall the brilliant
scintillation speedily proved itself to be a
deadly weapon and the hoarse clamor of
the mob changed to shrieks of pain and
fear

as the terrible ray flashed through the
crowd the odor of burning flesh rose to our
nostrils in a horrible stench and charred
corpses began to fall among the crowd

then as the ray was momentarily with-
drawn monas again leaped to the balcony
and cried in a loud voice

oh councillors if we die you will per-
ish also for your own good listen to me
metoor from his place motioned monas
to proceed

we are not without a defense monas
cried even now our men have seized the
anti-gravitational tower if you turn the
heat ray gun on us again we will plunge
the whole city to destruction

excitedly i whispered to novak

this is our chance it is now or never
he nodded and we began pushing a way
through tlie crowd for marna working to-

ward the flat topped building where the
submersible was moored

then the very earth beneath us seemed to
tremble we hesitated and then heard a
new shout of fear go up

in the lull we heard monas frantic
voice

fly for your lives the men at the tower
have mistaken the signal and are loosing
the waters upon daar

with that terrible cry ringing in our ears
we sped on icy blasts of air were sweep-
ing about us and as we neared the machine
drops of water like huge splashes of rain
began lo fall on us

hurry i panted

luck was with us for as we rounded the
last corner we saw that only one councillor
was on guard with the robots

slackening our pace novak and i crept
forward stealthily and then leaped the
councillor was taken unaware and strug-
gled fiercely but we fought with the fury
of desperation and soon felt his figure
go limp in our grasp the robots halted
stupidly in their tracks unaware of what
was taking place

then we heard the crashing of masonry
and turning saw one of the largest build-
ing in daar sway and then fall in an up-
roar of falling brick and stone
i next we heard a mighty whistling sound
not unlike that of a tornado magnified many
times

the light in the tower is out novak
screamed into my ear  gave one fleeting
glimpse and saw that the fiery ball in the
anti-gravitational tower was dark

then i gathered marna into iny arms for
the final dash to the door of the submersible
as we gained the security of the machine we
heard the titanic roar of the falling ocean

novak swung a switch the crafl gave a
terrifying wrench and then we could feel it
shoot rapidly upward through the only free
exit we were leaving the doomed city

the gland men of the

t  t  	malcolm r afford

how long they sat there contemplating our movements will never be
known for as i sighted them they became galvanized into life

 
an army of merciless inhuman creatures were ready
   under the masters hand they armed for
action    then nature entered the play   

to many who read my account of our
amazing adventure on the island of the
gland men it will serve as just another il-
lustration of how devious is the path of
science it will illustrate also how from
the darkness that girds it round terrible
possibilities loom black and menacing ter-
rifying those daring enough to wander from
the beaten track

another and i fear greater section of my
readers may harbour no such sentiments
labelling the whole as a tissue of preposter-
ous lies but to those who condemn me i
say i his take the facts-meagre garbled-
as they appeared in the uewpapers and at-
tempt to account for them in any other
way there is only one answer it is im-
possible

the intimate details were far too terrify-
ing and astounding to permit of the facts
being published verbatim and it was main-
ly due to the newspapers reticence that
something bordering on a world-wide panic
was averted

doctor bruce clovelly dd f r c s
will of course need no introduction for
his recent surgical triumphs in glanding
have made his name almost a by-word and
it is with guy follansbee that we must con-
cern ourselves follansbee as i knew him
in my days as laboratory assistant to the
doctor-one of those singularly fortunate
individuals who know exactly what they
want and how to get it without offending
a single soul-inclined to be cynical yet
straight as the proverbial string he had
inherited from his father an insatiable de-
sire for adventure and an income that ran
into i forget how many figures being a
man of somewhat simple philosophy he
used the latter to appease the former

it had taken our combined arguments
practised often and over long periods to
make the doctor even consider such a thing
as recreation and i had experienced the
hardest task of my life in getting him from
his chambers in gower street to which he

clung like diogenes to his wooden cavern
even after his actual transplanting on to
his opulent friends yacht the silver lady
he took his enforced holiday like a small
boy takes his medicine but as the illimi-
table miles of sparkling water grew between
our vessel and his stuffy chambers he turn-
ed about to enjoy himself

we were midway between the solomons
and santa cruz islands when the queer af-
fair began the morning had been oppres-
sively calm and follansbee the doctor and
myself had taken the electric launch to ex-
amine the rock fauna that flourished so pro-
lifically hereabouts it was characteristic of
the doctor that he could when required
produce inexhaustible stores of unexpected
knowledge on the most out-of-the-way sub-
jects and though i had never before heard
him mention marine growths here he was
expounding in his most didactic manner to
his slightly amused companion

having little taste in such matters i was
reclining upon the collapsible canvas chair
smoking a cigarette and occasionally dip-
ping my hand into the water in order to
convince myself that it would not emerge
dyed blue whether rocked by the gentle
motion of the boat i fell into a semi-doze
or whether the change swept down so quiok-
ly that its coming was unnoticed i cannot
say but i remember that i suddenly jump-
ed to my feet and called my companions
attention to the unpleasant condition of the
weather

in the east the sun flattened to a disc of
unhealthy brown was gradually giving way
to a dense bank of cloud that rushed down
with the rapidity of a drop curtain the
water had lost its turquoise hue and undu-
lated in a long oily swell that was strangely
suggestive of hidden power underneath
everywhere a heavy pall-like silence hung
over the face of nature fraught with an iu-
dcscribable sensation of impending danger
now and again there sounded very faint
and far-off a curious humming sob as of

come gigantic beast in an agony of torture the enveloping folds of some flaming para-

witbout the slightest intention of being
a first class jonah it was follansbees
first remark as he boarded the launch i
should say that we were in for something
extra in the way of dirty weather
doctor clovelly
ehrugged his should-
ers i should have
expected something
like this lo happen
h e said irritably

we should have nev-
left the yacht

er

what are our chances
worth if it catches us
in the open sea

the explorer snap-
ped finger and thumb

just that he aid
grimly the only
thing possible is lo cut
for the nearest island

with the weather like
this the storm may be
on us in five minutes
but on the other hand
it may hang off for
hours he swung
the wheel as he spoke
and ihe launch cut
thru the swell with a
curious sucking mo-
tion but ihe lord
help us it was fol-
lansbee speaking
again if it brings typ-
hoon in its wake

ilea ned over the
side and glanced at
the approaching is-
land through the
haze i discerned the
woods that flanked the
shining stretch of sil- 
ver sand unsullied by

mark or impression the thick vegetation
that grew tangled and luxurious down to
the waters edge here was a tumble-down
native hut raising its battered head above
the mass of tropic greenery there a sturdy
giant palm the trunk hidden from view by

ccientsts admit that
we are now on the verge
of great discoveries in bi-
ology we are just learn-
ing what we human beings
are and what the forces
are that control us why
are some men small and
others tall why are so
witty clever strong a
successful and others dul
stupid and apparently
without purpose or energy
in life the answer of the
biologist is glands-little
reservoirs of strange fluids
thefluidsthat course through
our blood and determine
our destiny this seems al-
most magical-that for ex-
ample a few drops of an
unknown fluid can deter-
mine a mans entire des-
tiny yet it has been proved
to be true

what a world we will
have then when we finally
discover how to control
these glands and make
them do for us what we
will we may have a na-
tion of supermen or a na-
tion of strong stupid
slavish servants it will all
depend on who controls the
glands the author of this
exciting tale was a profes-
sor of medicine himself
and his science is not only
exact but his story most
thrilling

site as we neared the beach i saw that
the land sloped sharply into rolling hill-
ocks cut and serried by deep gullies whose
black forbidding extremities were lost be-
neath the shadow of the higher mountains

i turned to our host
does it possess a
name i queried

he shook his head
probably one of the
numerous islands that
stud the polynesia like
stars in the milky
way they are here
today and gone tomor-
 row thrust up by some
volcanic eruption
eked under the sea
by a tidal wave or
some similar under-
sea disturbance

i sincerely hope
that it remains stable
during our occupa-
tion i remarked
then the launch
grounded on the shore
and i jumped out lo
aid follansbee to beach
it high and dry this
done we took our first
close look at ihe is-
land our enforced
landing place

as we stood on the
clean fringe of sand
the hush of the ele-
ments was even more
apparent not a leaf
moved in the thick hu-
mid heat not a bird
flew or animal moved
it seemed as though all
 nature was waiting
breathlessly for the op-
ening of the cataclysm but for the low
rumble of the breakers we might have trod
another planet some long dead world and
the thick sand deadening our footsteps gave
us a peculiar disembodied sensation that
was unpleasant in the extreme it was fol-
th gland men of the island



lansbee who broke the silence no good
cooling our heels on this beach he said
under the circumstances i think it would
he worth our while to do a little exploring
that track through the trees seera to sug-
gest unlimited possibilities he broke off
and pointed to where a worn track wound
its way through the undergrowth

at least remarked the doctor as we
made our way toward it we cannot claim
to be true crusoes someone has used this
path pretty frequently-and not so long
ago if we are to judge by its appearance

animals- i suggested

much too narrow interjected follans-
bee then again the beasts have no ob-
ject in coming here
there is no water to drink
nothing to eat and from
my experience of ani-
mals they generally
shun the seabeach he
glanced at the dry rotted
grass no my sonny
that track was made by
one thing only-a num-
ber of men walking in
single file

 looked blankly at the
waste of matted under-
growth and stunted trees

but where on earth did
they go i asked

that was the reply

is what we are going to
find out

in single file we followed the circuitous
path for over a mile follansbee leading his
grey eyes gleaming the doctor next and i
bringing up the rear through virgin
greenery that walled us on either side so
thick that one seemed lo be treading some
matted corridor we went on beneath wild
and tangled growth through which the sick-
ly light scarcely penetrated over young lush
leafage that overlay and half disguised the
dank rottenness of the older vegetation
through which loathsome creeping things
scuttled as we approached things hideous
and detestable to look upon

the last portion of our journey was ter-
rible here a fair-sized stream had become

bogged by matted reeds and the spread of
water was rapidly turning the surrounding
country into a poisonous swamp clouda
of insects hung over the black evil-smelling
pools some huge as wasps with bodies of
every conceivable hue and blend some whose
sting was death others bred in the fever
areas carrying with them their dread leg-
acy the sibilant hum was discernable
quite a distance away and it sounded eerily
out of place in that region of silence and
decay

suddenly with the abruptness that was
almost startling the forest ended and we
saw ahead of us a flat plain we were just
about to step out  to the wide clearing
when follansbee who
was leading uttered a
cry of amazement stif-
fened and stood stock
still he was staring at
some scene below him on
the plain and as we ap-
proached he turned and
finger on lip pointed
stepping quietly we
drew alongside him and
i choked down the gasp
that rose in my throat

we were looking on a
wide barren area of land
in the centre of which
was a cluster of iron
buildings that they
were tenanted was ob-
vious by the thin trail of
smoke that curled its way from the chim-
neys one edifice slightly isolated from the
rest was surrounded by a high wooden
stockade pierced at intervals by loopholes

the creatures of the island

as we watched thunderstruck by our dis-
covery from one side of the stockade
came a troupe of figures there seemed no
doubt that they were men but such men as
i have never before set eyes upon they
were of enormous stature most of them be-
ing over eight feet in height they moved
with a peculiar lumbering gait that was
vaguely suggestive of something that i could

wonder stories

not place their arms swinging at their
sides seemed absurdly out of proportion lo
their bodies and the great hands clasped
tightly upon an object that at the distance
looked like an axe

each wore a kind of khaki shirt and
breeches with leather leggings that reached
from instep lo knee a sun helmet took
the place of a hat and as one turned away
from us i noticed a peculiar irregular
blotch upon the back of the shirt at first
i took this to be some personal damage but
a further glance showed me that each wore
a similar adornment at the distance how-
ever it was impossible to distinguish ihe
outline

by gad exclaimed follansbee as he
unslung his glasses we seem to have
stumbled on a modern brobdingnag thank
heaven for that storm

the doctor was already examining the
monsters so after a scrutiny the explorer
passed his glasses to me i adjusted the
powerful lens lo my sight and the ap-
proaching creatures leapt into my field of
vision

if at a distance these creatures looked
unprepossessing they seemed doubly so at
close quarters the lens picked out every
detail with horrifying clearness the broad
hunched shoulders the long muscular arms
covered with coarse black hair the slouch-
ing movement caused  now perceived by
the ridiculously short bandy legs as one
stopped to converse with his neighbour he
turned and the ragged blotch on his shirt
took definite shape i started again think-
ing that my eyes were playing me tricks

the shape was that of a five-clawed drag-
on reared in the act of striking il was
either stamped or sewn on in black cloth

but il was the features that drew the eye
and held it in sheer horror so hideously
repulsive were they the tiny head with
its wide slobbering mouth the wicked red
eyes and the flat coarse nostrils inspired
one with a thrill of disgust and loathing
the low receding forehead and the forward
position of the ears showed that were they
humans they were of a very low scale of
civilization

my god i heard clovelly gasp are
they man or beast

i opened my mouth to answer when from
behind there came a rustle of disturbed un-
dergrowth i swung around but there was
nothing to account for the sound when act-
ing on some unknown impulse i glanced
up into the tangle ofbranches above a
cry of horror burst from my lips for there
above us silent and motionless as the sur-
rounding forest crouched four of those
hideous creatures thal we had been watch-
ing how long they had sat there their
blood-shot eyes contemplating our move-
ments will never be known for as i sight-
ed them they became galvanized into life
with guttural screams they sprang upon us
and i was just about to run for my life
when one gathered me beneath his arm like
a bundle of hay and with a curious wab-
bling stride made for the walled-in build-
ing

chapter ii
a place of terror

in an incredibly short space of time we
had reached the high partition here
the creatures paused and shouting some-
thing in the guttural tongue pointed to the
gate then to his companions in the rear
in my awkward position i was unable to
glimpse the one to whom he spoke but it
was obviously the guardian of the portal
for even as i screwed my neck to breaking
point the obstacle swung back  and we
passed through

i judged by the stamp of the feet be-
hind thal my colleagues were likewise cap-
tives and by the sounds of struggle that
they were not submitting so tamely as i
perhaps i was unfortunate in possessing a
particularly irascible gaoler for my puny
efforts at escape had resulted in nothing
more than a cuff across the face that near-
ly took my head off maybe it was just a
gentle reminder that he would stand for no
nonsense but it served to quiet me beyond
further resistance

we traversed a slight dip and breasting
the slope came to the main residence il
the gland men of the island



was much more pretentious than the out-
buildings with neatly laid paths and flow-
erbeds though the blooms could not be
called healthy across the roof were loop-
ed slender wires standing clear against the
coppery sky terminating in twin aerial
poles it strengthened my conviction that
we had reached the headquarters of this
amazing island

four wooden steps led us into a wide hall
way carpeted with rush mats that strewed
the floor at regular intervals a number
of doors dimly discernible in the uncertain
light opened off this passage whose extre-
mity was lost in the prevailing gloom

it was here that my guard at last set me
down and turning signed to his companions
to do likewise i smoothed my rumpled ap-
parel into something approaching order and
turning beheld follansbee as imperturbable
as ever in the act of lighting a cigarette
clovelly seemed still stunned with amaze-
ment and he looked at me with eyes that
hinted a thousand questions

before he had time to utter a word one
of the creatures wheeled around and disap-
peared into one of the rooms as he op-
ened the door i became aware of a peculiar
odor-sweet sickly-that emanated from
behind it for just a second it eluded me
then as it grew stronger i recognized it im-
mediately-chloroform

i glanced at clovelly and smiled wryly
he was sniffing the air like a thoroughbred
his professional instincts aroused i no-
ticed the slender white fingers quiver like
the antennae of some giant insect itching
for the scalpel or the forceps

seeing ray interest he opened his mouth
to speak but what he meant lo say will nev-
er be known suddenly tearing jaggedly
across the stillness there came a horrifying
shriek of some poor soul in mortal agony
higher and higher it rose in shrill cadence
then at the highest note it ceased abruptly
to die away in a gurgling mumble then si-
lence-thick-enveloping-sinister-

 am not easily frightened but an icy hor-
ror gripped my heart clovelly was white
to the lips and even follansbee was shaken
out of his customary equanimity our huge
guardians seemed absolutely unmoved by

the horird experience not an emotion was
discernable upon their animal countenances
they were as devoid of expression as a rub-
ber doll

at that moment the door re-opened and
our guide appeared taking advantage of
the diversion i crossed to the half open
door and essayed to peep inside i was al-
most there when one of the creatures sprang
forward and with an angry grunt grasped
my arm and with such force that i cried out
our huge guide turned quickly and looking
questioningly at his subordinate as i took
the other to be fired a volley of unintelli-
gible jargon at him suddenly the creature
released me as though i had become red-
hot and a look of something akin to de-
ference crossed the bestial face but i hard-
ly noticed this for my head was buzzing
with a new discovery the opening and
shutting of the door had afforded me a mo-
mentary glimpse beyond-a fleeting vision
of a modern operating theatre the tables
instruments and assistants showing spotless-
ly clean in the bright artificial light

one of the creatures crossed to a portion
of the wall opposite the door and pressing
on it moved his hands in a curious circular
manner

the reason for this was plainly obvious
the next moment for there came the sound
of a metallic click and a section of the wall
swung back to reveal a door set flush in the
woodwork with more haste than cere-
mony we were thrust through this door it
clicked behind us-and for the first time
since our capture we were left alone

but we had no desire to converse we
were struck silent by the extraordinary
appearance of the singular apartment in
which we found ourselves i can close my
eyes now and recall every feature of that
bizarre apartment as though it were yester-
day so indelibly are the details engraven
on my mind

it was circular in shape and lined with
books from floor to ceiling the reds and
golds of the bindings reflecting the light
from the mosaic shaded lamp that hung in
the center of the room beneath this was a
huge bowl of roses the colours shading

from one extreme to the other some there
were so dark as to appear almost black to
vivid scarlet and flaming yellow to others so
delicately tinted as to truly rival the shy
blush of the maiden they filled the room
with a heavy exotic perfume and as i gazed
one of the flowers fullblown in that super-
heated atmosphere burst slowly and the
creamy petals drifted slowly-one by one-
lightly as thistledown-onto the rich red
carpet on the floor

behind this great bouquet was a square
block of perfectly grained black marble
flanked on either side by fantastically
wrought incense burners poised on the
marble base was a five-clawed dragon in
the act of striking carved from solid ivory
with the meticulous care that characterizes
the oriental artist so cleverly was it
wrought that the object seemed to possess a
personality that was both fascinating yet
repellent it was wickedly beautiful in its
own way and it recalled to me similar emo-
tions when i had first handled a renais-
sance stiletto

directly opposite the carving the books
ended abruptly to recommence at an inter-
val of about three feet wide across the
aperture was hung a heavy plush curtain
crimson with golden edging and worked
with poppies and roses it fell in heavy
folds that hung motionless in the still air
exuding an influence of the obscene and the
unmentionable

i turned and something caused me to rub
my eyes of the door we had entered there
was no sign save for the curtained aper-
ture the book-lined walls continued in an
unbroken line around the room hardly
able to believe the evidence of my own eyes
i walked up and ran my fingers over them
my hand encountered bindings-red-gold
-that winked mockingly in the vari-colour-
ed radiance

the choice of books in themselves was
remarkable the titles covered a wide
range from the transcendental and meta-
physical and all manner of works on the
processes and oddities of the human thought
seemed to be assembled there they ranged
from the days of black magic to psycho-
therapeutics of the modern analytical school

there were volumes by zaasman and jung
together with other foreign scientists on
the morbid phenomena of the brain

interested in spite of myself i took down
one book in german a tongue with which i
am fairly conversant but after a hurried
glance returned it hastily to its position

it was a study of dementia praecox and
its plates of naked german lunatics almost
turned my stomach quite unused as i was
to the german scientific treatment of the
more repellent disorders of life

at the end of the highest row were a
number of volumes touching on the influ-
ence of suggestion on the human mind
they ranged from the early investigations
of bertrand and of james braid to the more
recent studies of auto-suggestion by coue and
other modern french writers in this line of
thought

by jove follansbee the doctors softly
spoken remark brought me round like a
shot you wanted adventure you craved
something different-well youve got it
with a vengeance

a narrow escape

the big explorer shrugged his shoulders
there aremore things in heaven and
earth my dear horatio-he quoted
we seem to have stumbled fairly into the
latest six shilling sensationalism he
glanced at the watch on his wrist by the
lord harry its almost ten oclock i
could tackle the proverbial leg of an iron
pot im that peckish i sincerely hope
someone puts in an appearance shortly he
broke off and glanced round the room
who owns this musical comedy apartment
anyway

the doctor paced the room his hands
locked behind his back do you know
he said as he drew abreast of us i rather
fancy that we are on the eve of a momentous
discovery taking the curious events in
their sequence we have the finding of the
islands the well-worn path through the
woods of an apparently uninhabited island
and our discovery of the giant creatures that
eventually captured us add to that the fact
that there is installed here something in the
the gland men of the island



form of ail operating theatre-so much is
plain by the use of chloroform-and we are
left to arrive at only one conclusion
why i broke in behind that door
from whence the ether fuines emanated is
an operating theatre up-to-date and modern
in every respect though  caught just a
glimpse as the door opened i recognized
the newington naphtha flares and they have
yet to be installed in the princes hospital
evidently whoever uses the room insists on
every known appliance

clovelly nodded absently exactly
it bears out my theory that before we leave
this island we are going to learn that
science in the hands of the unscrupulous
can do quite so much harm as it can do
good he turned to me you huxley
with your medical knowledge can you not
glimpse at what is taking place here

i shook my head and coloured slightly
i can perceive nothing more than is appar-
ent to all of us in some manner the ruler
or owner of this island has possessed him-
self of some secret formula for the making
of super-men this he does by some deli-
cate operation for the elaborately equipped
operating room and the modern blood fil-
ter are both necessary in the course of the
metamorphosis

and have you no idea of how this trans-
formation is effected

not the slightest but i know enough
to be aware that he has a tremendous power
for good or ill just how he intends to use
it is a matter for conjecture

the doctor turned to follansbee but that
gentleman was gazing intently at the cur-
tained-off aperture he closed his eyes
tight and shook his head either im go-
ing clean blind batty or my eyes have de-
veloped the shakes but im certain that i
saw that curtain move i was just standing
here when-look there now do you see it
he broke off abruptly and pointed a finger
at the gentle moving cloth

we stared as if fascinated at the slowly
writhing folds as it twisted and coiled itself
into thick pleats to belly out like a sail in
the sea breeze and then resolve into tiny
undulations that rippled across the crimson
surface but the culmination came when

from behind it there arose a peculiar cough-
ing grunt followed by a gasp of someone or
something struggling for breath

what fresh deviltry is this muttered
the explorer uneasily he raised his voice
anyone there he called

there was no answer but  for one was
hardly surprised it was not enough for
follansbee though he squared his broad
shoulders and clenched his fists i say
he called again is anyone there behind
that curtain

but the silence of the weird circular cham-
ber was unbroken the curtains were mo-
tionless now another rose bloom a flow-
er almost dead black fell to pieces al-
most mechanically i counted the falling
petals-one-two-three

the big watcher paused just one second
then with chin jutting ominously he strode
toward the aperture i could not but ad-
mire the stark courage of the man facing
unarmed a danger increased a thousand-
fold because of its indefinable quality
though my heart beat suspiciously fast i
stepped up beside him and we were almost
to the curtain when an unlooked-for contin-
gency occurred

i would advise you gentlemen to leave
things that do not concern you untouched
the consequences of spying are sometimes
painful in the extreme

the voice was suave and modulated but
it possessed the quality of a revolver
shot il could not have startled us more
we whirled as if stung and gazed with wide
eyes at the author

he was standing a little in rear of dr
clovelly and his manner of entry was a
matter for conjecture certainly none of us
had heard him but as he was standing
where i presumed the secret entrance to
be situated i judged that he had achieved
egress in like manner

it needed only a seconds scrutiny to place
the man as an oriental hut he was clothed
in a neat fitting grey suit and shod with
smart square-toed patent shoes his skin
was smooth and butter-yellow and a pair of
large tortoise-shell glasses bridge his nose
the huge pebbles making the eyes absurdly
wonder stories

out of proportion with the rest of the coun-
tenance he wore his hair long and brush-
ed back off a high intellectual forehead
he spoke with just a slightest trace of ac-
cent a metallic emunciation of the consonant
r-a trait which characterises even the
most educated of chinamen

i trust gentlemen that you will excuse
the somewhat rough handling strangers
are not welcome on the island of ho ming
especially white strangers

as the insolent voice ceased a thin ironi-
cal smile curved the thin lips revealing two
rows of yellow teeth but there was no
humour in the narrow-lidded purple-black
eyes for in their inky depths there lurked
the cruel passionless look of one who had
gaed too long on agony and suffering to
feel the sorrow and pity of it all they re-
minded me of the loathsome orbs of a hood-
ed cobra

follansbee was first lo recover from his
surprise if we are nol asking too much
he asked quietly may i enquire just where
we are and whal relation you bear to all
this he waved his hand around ihe bizarre
apartment

with all the slow dignity of his race the
chinaman raised his hand i will explain
in my own time he said blandly it is
i who give orders now and you will obey - -
he smiled at the angry follansbee-no
then steps will be laken to make you obey
we of hankow have many methods of cur-
ing obstinancy

dr clovelly started forward we are
british subjects he cried if you harm
us in any manner the government will blow
your island to glory and you will end your
career with a rope around your neck

the chinaman bowed and spread his
hands if it eases you to entertain such
delusions dr clovelly by all means do so
bui you have evidently forgotten the neces-
sity of communicating your unfortunate
position to your government

how do you know my name

i know many things for i am the chosen
ruler of the people of the ming dragon
you have arrived at a most opportune mo-
ment- the oriental broke off abruptly-

gentleman i have a proposition to put be-
fore you

he walked over to the black marble dais
and seated himself thereon for a moment
he sat thus seeming deep in thought then
he raised his eyes and glanced at each of us
in turn

now he began i want you to hold no
delusions as to your position on this island
you are my prisoners for me to do with
you as i whim but you are all men who
have achieved some fame in your respective
professions and i have no desire to rob the
world of your talents so-i offer this
truce

he turned in his seat and directed a long
slender finger at the doctor i know you
clovelly as one of the greatest of living
authorities on the gland-grafting treatment
your studies with steinach in vienna when
you unearthed the cod bone method proved
to me that you had the business of glanding
and rejuvenation at your fingertips mr
james huxley your assistant needs no in-
troduction to me nor does your friend mr
follansbee

you have no doubt been rightfully be-
wildered over the strange creatures that in-
habit this place hesitating to categorise
them as either man or beast let me set
your mind at rest and inform you that they
are neither and yet both that is lo say
they possess ihe characteristics both animal
and human because they are of a scale of
civilization that is intermediate they eat
walk talk and work possess the strength
of ten men live to an almost prodigious age
and lastly possess a certain immunity from
sickness and disease they are my gland
men and are the latest triumph of modern
science

the monotonous tones ceased and the
speaker taking from his pocket an inlaid
case extracted a cigarette i blinked my
eyes and breathed hard thoroughly con-
vinced that i was mad or dreaming the
coloured shade slained the floor with its
dancing hues the rose-scented air seemed
charged with the dominant personality of
the owner the scratch of a match recalled
me and i saw the smoke curl through the
nostrils of the oriental as he lay back and
the gland men of the island



surveyed us with his narrow oblique eyes
lowered to mere slits

chapter iii
a gigantic scheme

utvtow gentlemen behind this is a story

i i of patience and attention to detail
that can only be achieved by one in search
of an ideal up on the slopes of the white
headed mountain on the western border of
tibet there stands a lamasery known as the
brothers of the golden khan it is the
holy of holies this desolate edifice for in
its sacred precincts there dwells the most
illustrious deity the grand lama dalai
he is a beautiful youth with skin as soft
as a maiden and limbs muscular and sym-
metrical though he has attained the dis-
tinguished age of two hunched years he has
the appearance of an unsullied youth a fit
spectacle for the thousands of devout china-
men who yearly visited the shrine leaving
it richer by gifts and money

now my father entered that lamasery
as a youth not because of any religious
urgings but because he regarded the per-
manent youth of their deity to be nothing
more than a gigantic hoax to attract money
and notoriety to their shrine he knew
that the priests must possess some miracu-
lous secret of preserving eternal youth and
he meant to obtain that formula cost what
it may that the task was no sinecure was
obvious but he had the patience and per-
severance that only one of the east can in-
herit

for forty long years my father lived
with the priests and he was just on the
point of achieving his lifes desire when
he was betrayed by a treacherous servant
he was caught and after a year of endless
torture eventually made his escape he fled
to hankow where i was studying surgery
and delivered into my hands the sacred
tomes containing the great secret formu-
la further information i could not re-
ceive for amongst other things the lama
priests had torn my fathers tongue from his
mouth thus making him dumb forever

then followed a reign of terror for us

my father and i flew from place to plaoe
but nowhere could we escape the watchful
eye of the vengeful priests who by that
lime had discovered the missing volumes
at length  evolved a plan by which we
would be free from further persecution
i personally sought an interview with the
great emperor dragon the great shera
sing and laid my plans before him he
was delighted with the idea and not only
gave orders that i should be protected but
also agreed to finance the scheme in view

one of the chapters in the book dealt
extensively with that branch of anatomy
known as the endocrine glands as you
gentlemen are aware this is but a newly
discovered phase of surgery but to the holy
brothers it had been old knowledge there
is nothing in this earth so strange and fan-
tastic as the history of those obscure bod-
ily organs that mean more than life to us

amongst other things the two most fre-
quently mentioned were the thyroid that
shield-like gland astride our adams apple
and the pituitary hanging from the base of
our brain by a hollow stem the pituitary
controls our growth but the thyroid con-
trols everything that makes our life worth
while

children with deficient thyroids-from
atrophy removal or injury-become things
horrible to look upon giibbering idiotic
dwarfs-heavy featured and twisted yi body
cretins they are called for they never met-
amorphose into normal adults hence the
importance of the obscure organ

but the brethren experimented on
aquatic larvae they caught a tadpole and
removed its thyroid it never became a
frog but remained a tadpole for the re-
mainder of its existence on the other
hand they gorged a tadpole with thyroxin
and almost immediately it changed to a
frog i say changed gentlemen not grew-
because the tadpole did not grow the
frog fully developed remained only aa
large as a tadpole thyroxin feeding pro-
duces two results it hastens metamorphos-
is but retards growth

with this information my father and
myself started out upon our momentous
schemc we obtained the thyroid from an


wonder stories

ape and transferred it to that of a three-
months-old baby almost immediately the
child began to exhibit simian characteris-
tics-then the body began to alter shape
but the child grew no larger than the day
the gland was transferred and it was to ov-
ercome this difficulty that we set ourselves

now the growth or pituitary gland is
not a vital organ but a normal gland is
essential to normal life an operation on
the pituitary is enormously difficult-for
one thing it is only as big as the tip of the
little finger and it is so near the centre of
the head that it is next to impossible to
localize but we finally overcame this
difficulty and all was ready for the final
experiment

 i  is was the scheme in mind if a
jl grafted thyroid could transform a
child to an ape would it not be possible to
transplant the glands of an anthropoid to
that of a growing human an operation on
the pituitary would overcome the difference
in growth and the finished product would
possess the strength and power of an anth-
ropoid and the intelligence and appearance
of a human being

such was the scheme that occurred to
me luckily i was possessed of twelve sis-
ters and each in turn gave their lives for
science still we were unsuccessful the
creatures of our experiments being things
hideous and fearful to look upon that were
killed as soon as tested then our faithful
servants professed themselves willing to
give their lives three there were and by a
strange freak of fate it was the last at-
tempt that was successful wc achieved a
huge beast such as you see here today and
it was this creature that we took to the em-
peror as proof of our good faith then we
outlined to him our momentous scheme

what a great thing it would be for our
decadent empire could we but manufacture
an army of these gland men they would
be immune from hurts and outlive the
strongest of soldiers again they would
seek for nothing in return fighting but to
appease their brutal instincts with an
army such as these we could wipe the en-
tire white race from the world and restore

china to her rightful position as mistress
of the world the magnificence of the
scheme fairly dazzled me such prodigious
possibilities did it possess

here you see the great scheme in em-
bryo thanks to the magnificent genero-
sity of the emperor we have unlimited fac-
ilities for the great scheme in progress
once more he paused and the hard black
eyes alight with the fire of fanaticism
gleamed and sparkled like wet anthracite
coal he leaned forward and waved a thin
yellow hand in our direction

white men he said here is an un-
doubted truth in a decade this colony will
be a serious menace to your white civiliza-
tion-and in fifty years we will sweep you
off the earth china will return to her
rightful position and the world will bow
down to the despised chinaman

really follansbees coolness was sup-
erb and if we whites are considered such
a nonentity why expound to such a length
to us

the light died out of the orientals
countenance and the eyes narrowed percep-
tibly he inhaled deeply on his cigarette
and as the smoke curled through the flat
nostrils the pungent odour hung in wisps
on the heavily scented air

my gland men he murmured so softly
that the purring voice was scarcely heard
lack but two things one-the method of
human speech and the other-of paramount
importance-is their sexlessness it is upon
you gentlemen that i rely for the rectifica-
tion of those surgical errors

dr clovelly took a step forward and
if we refuse

the oriental shrugged his shoulders
 have just attended to two operations this
morning he replied meaningly and in
the advent of your refusal  will attend
three more tomorrow morning

do you mean that you operate here
certainly why not we have every
facility of modern science and a laboratory
that is the last word in the up-to-date
but-but- babbled dr clovelly
amazedly your supplies-and chemicals
ho ming gave an upward gesture of his
hands wireless he explained a call
the gland men of the island



to our base will bring a ship load of sup-
plies within a few days that is what has
cut that path through the undergrowth
but your-er-patients do not recover
immediately you must have a hospital or
something of the kind

if you consent to my proposition dr
clovelly i will make arrangements for you
to be shown over ray island as soon as it is
possible

clovelly spread his hands helplessly
under the circumstances he ac-
quiesced we can do nothing but submit
but you must promise that we meet with no
treachery

the chinaman inclined his head have
no fear of that he assured us and now
i shall show you around you shall see
that this is no wild dream of mine it has
taken years to accrue the knowledge and
effects but it is all to the one purpose
with his quick silent walk he crossed
over to the crimson curtain and pausing
before it spoke for some moments in the
pure liquid ho man dialect from inside
there came a rustle of silken garments and
suddenly as we listened there arose again
that evil voiceless murmuring that we had
heard on the previous occasion ho ming
turned to and waved a hand in the direction
of the curtaingd aperture

my illustrious father-the great bald
one-the learned wong ktai who first
wrested the priceless formula from the
lama pigs and to whose patience and saint-
ly perseverance this island owes its exis-
tence	v

so that was the solution of the peculiar
sounds and i was about to pace forward
when ho ming with a peculiar smile held
out a restraining arm he then picked up
a slim ivory wand and with a quick move-
ment stabbed it at the curtain immediate-
ly there came a szz and a bright flash as
something shot through the air but so
quick-so unexpected-was the whole ac-
tion that i did not have time to glimpse
the object the next moment the china-
man with a bland smile moved forward
and held aside the curtains

the room into which we looked could

not have been more than six feet square but
screened on all sides as it was by rich hang-
ings it gave the illusion of depths that
was very cleverly carried out the black
velvet hangings were worked with a be-
wildering array of birds and flowers in
colours both rare and wonderful scarlet
parrots blue peacocks were entwined with
crimson poppies and roses of every shade
and hue gaudy though it undoubtedly
was there was nothing in it to offend the
eye for the colours were blended with the
skill of an expert

in the center of the room in a huge chair
that almost enveloped the slight form sat
the oldest chinaman i have ever set eyes on
he was thin to emaciation and the rich pur-
ple robe he wore hung in folds about his
skinny frame his head bowed slightly
with the weight of years was as bald as ar
egg and the long beard that hung from his
chin was white as the driven snow the
face was seamed with a thousand wrinkles
and only the beady eyes sunk deep in the
lined countenance gave a hint of vitality
he sat motionless like some grotesque idol
a fit parent lo this place of sinister secrets

ho ming entered the room and pausing
before the chair fell upon his knees for
some moments there was a silence then
slowly like one in a trance one claw-like
hand yellow as ivory was raised in salute
for a second it remained poised then as
though its owner lacked strength to hold it
in place it fell limply back onto the chair
ho ming rose to his feet

the great one salutes you and wishes
you well gentlemen you may consider
yourselves doubly honoured

he re-crossed the room and as he made
his way through the doorway the curtain
dropped behind him synonymous with it
came the swish and the flash and the orien-
tal with quick movement touched a portion
of the woodwork immediately the object
came lo rest and for the first time we saw
it it was a blade some six inches wide and
the width of the doorway a blade razor-
edged and weighted at the top it ran
down between the door-posls on a concealed
wire very much on the principle of the
french device the guillotine at an almost


wonder stories

incredible speed the oriental released it
and it disappeared into a slot in the floor

quite chinese he purred borrowed
from the palaces of the emperors by the
way he turned to follansbee it was as
well that i arrived when i did this morning
for had you stepped across the threshold
you would have been cleft in half he
walked to the book-lined wall and moved
his hands in the circular manner we had
noticed before with a click of concealed
machinery the section swung back and we
filed into the dimly lit passage now
our guide cautioned us keep close to me
and offer no resistance no matter what hap-
pens

chapter iv

awaiting the storm

the contrast betwn the brightly lit
room and the semi-darkness of the pas-
sage was so great that for some moments i
could perceive nothing far less distinguish
any objects the luminous dial of my
watch told me that it was just past the noon
hour and  could not but help reflecting
that we had certainly spent a crowded hour
it seemed incredible that all our strange
adventures had been compassed in such a
short space of time already we seemed to
have spent months on the island and eng-
land and prince alfreds hospital seemed
very far away

gradually as my eyes became accustomed
to the light i made out the various doors
leading from the strange apartment the
oriental ho ming took the lead and we oth-
ers trailed behind him at the end of the
passage he paused before a door

this our guide explained with a ges-
ture is the laboratory here it is that the
serum is compounded that speeds up our
workers and helps them to overcome the
laziness that they inherit from the anthro-
poid side of their nature adrenin ob-
tained as you know from the adrenals near
the kidneys forms a large percentage of
the serum adrenin is the greatest and
most natural stimulant known to mankind
he threw open the door and we surveyed

a long low room with wooden benchea
running the entire length upon these were
placed a heterogeneous collection of scien-
tific instruments-microscopes galvano-
meters and centrifuges everything was
scrupulously clean and three assistants in
spotless overalls hovered silently about the
room ho ming gave a sharp order and
immediately one of the men crossed to the
bench and procured a test tube half-full of
some dirty brown liquid this he placed
in his masters hand

this is the inoculation serum explained
the chinaman you must understand that
the ape-glands are incredibly strong and
that if left to themselves must ultimately
reduce their owner to a state of bestial
idiocy to prevent this an injection of the
serum is necessary at least once a week
the result of the adrenin in the blood is
at once apparent it speeds up the slug-
gish heart beat drives fatigue from the
muscles and prepares the body for emer-
gency function a very simple formula
he returned the tube to its place as he spoke
i discovered it something like two years
ago

he closed the door and we retraced our
steps along the passage removal of the
thyroids and parathyroids necessitates cut-
ting away certain portions of the larynx
he was explaining to the doctor we tried
cutting through the windpipe into the cri-
coid cartilage- and he rambled away into
the realms of surgery with clovelly listen-
ing delighted and entranced

i took advantage of his immersion to
drop back with follansbee what do you
think of it all anyway i muttered

he surveyed me for a moment his grey
eyes lighted humorously two things
strike me with perturbing force one is
that our oriental friend is a loyal fanatic
and means every word he says the other
is that we are in the very devil of a hole and
i dont mind telling you young fellow that
just at present  fail lo see the tiniest loop-
hole of escape

do you think the man is mad i mur-
mured having digested the somewhat dis-
turbing statement of the other

follansbee shrugged his shoulders-he
the gland men of the island



may be he assented there is no doubt
that he is clever-and cleverness and insan-
ity often go hand in hand

i glanced to where the two men were
holding excited converse i do believe that
dr clovelly is really enjoying himself i
remarked softly hes hanging on to the
chinamans words as though they were
pearls of great price

the other man smiled a trifle grimly
i think that ihe doctor will be quite safe
he returned its little us thats worrying
this child you see we may be guests of
honor for as long as the childish vanity of
our hosts continues but one day theyll run
short of raw material and then- he made
an expressive gesture

i was about to reply when the chinaman
paused with his hand on another door he
regarded us suspiciously as we walked up
together and his voice was as sweet as honey
as he observed

do not linger behind my friends he
glanced over his shoulder as he spoke
there are many strange things in the abode
of ho ming fingers that claw and grasp
hands that tear and break it is very fool-
ish to stray behind

with that he pushed the door and as
it swung open we glimpsed a well-
lighted apartment with twin rows of beds
running along either side around two of
the nearest white screens were placed and
from behind one of these a faint moaning
emanated hje air was charged with the
acrid tang of carbolic and as before every-
thing spoke of scrupulous attention to de-
tail

my hospital it was explained my
patients come here from the operating tab-
les and from here they emerge to the out-
buildings to do their allotted share among
their fellows there is no intervening per-
iod which we know as convalescence
a week in hospital is long enough for the
newly grafted gland to function then
sunlight fresh air and hard work do the
rest it is amazingly simple

but i interpolated where do you get
your material to work on it must come
rather hard to find men willing to sacrifice

themselves to this sort of roman holiday

convicts from the state prisons furnish
us with much work was the cold reply
murderers servants and occasionally a
few are pressed into service by my assist-
ants who form a modern equivalent to
your old-time press-gang

i grinned a trifle rudely bang goes
your dream of world revolution i return-
ed if that is how you progress after
weeding your prisons clear of undesirable
characters the magnum opus will languish
and finally die of insufficient means of
support

ho ming turned his unfathomable black
eyes upon me presumptous fool he
said coldly china now possesses an
army of six thousand men drilled and per-
fect in the art of war as soon as circum-
stances will allow sufficient serum will be
despatched and under the treatment of my
assistants every soldier will become a
gland man after that every man who en-
ters the army will be likewise glanded and
in time we shall possess an entire army of
these supermen

i raised no more questions for if the
oriental was insane there was assuredly
method in his madness in fact the gigantic
scheme was too complete and for the first
time the true meaning of this mans insane
dream chilled me with its appalling possi-
bilities the doctors voice broke in on my
reflections

and are all your operations successful
he asked in such a delicate business as
this one would think ihe failures out-
weighed the successes

ho ming looked at the speaker his eyes
alight with a peculiar gleam yes he
said slowly we do have failures in spite
of our precautions before you see them
i warn you-they are not pretty to look
upon

he led the way through a side door and
we found ourselves once more in the day
light the weather had changed complete-
ly since our sojourn inside the sky bras-
sy before was now almost clear the hard
blue sullied by a thick band of black clouds
that spread themselves like some ebon cano-
py across the eastern sky little puffs of


wonder stories

wind stirred the dust and dried leaves at
our feet whirling them into the blue the
atmosphere was thick apd heavy so heavy
indeed that some difficulty was experienced
in breathing and the sun poured down with
a fierce heat that was almost unbearable
the silence was broken intermittently by a
low sibilant hum

follansbee glanced curiously around him
its coming he said appreciatively its
coming and by heaven i pity this place
if it strikes it

we skirted the main building and passed
through the high wooden stockade till we
reached the outbuildings some little way
further on we could perceive a number of
the queer inhabitants engaged in erecting
a new structure they swung the huge tree-
trunks as though they were light sticks and
in an amazingly short time the central
framework was raised

we passed a long building constructed
of rough hewn timbers containing a num-
ber of small cubicles each separate room
had its neatly folded mattress and shining
eating utensils the place contained no
comforts whatever-just the bare necessities
of living and was obviously the domestic
quarters of the strange beings that ho ming
called his gland men

the revenge of nature

a peculiar smell was predominant
here increasing in strength as we made
our way onward everyone is familiar
with the loathsome animal smell that is
prevalent wherever beasts are incarcerated
it emanated from a tiny hillock built over
an underground cellar a gate led us down
about a dozen steps cut in the earth and
brought us up before a massive iron door
with a barred grating set in the top the
snapping and snarling of animals came
clearly to our ears and the words of the
oriental they are not good to look upon
took on fresh significance

the chinaman who was in the lead
stepped forward and sliding back the grat-
ing motioned me up i peered in scarce-
ly knowing what to expect and hardly had

i	taken one brief glimpse when i recoiled

was a gasp of horror even dante in his
journey through the innermost hells could
scarcely have viewed such horrible crea-
tures as haunted that underground pit

there must have been over a dozen of
them-loathsome-terrible some twisted
beyond any semblance of recognition oth-
ers with stunted bodies and bloated appen-
dages growing on various parts of their
anatomy they stood silent as i glimpsed
them looking at me mildly with their blood-
shot eyes gesticulating with their crooked
shrunken limbs but the crowning horror
was the undeniable fact that once these
lhings had been men even as you and i
living-hating-breathing

as i stumbled up the stairs sick with
horror  was joined by the oriental who
stood watching me with a sardonic smile
on his lips  did not speak but stood
there drinking in the thick air in thirsty
gulps and then suddenly it happened

it began by the sunlight fading and
glancing up i saw lhat the monstrous black
cloud had overshadowed almost all the sky
leaving only a portion over the sea that
glowed eerily with an uncanny elfin rad-
iance the low intermittent humming had
risen in cadence and was coming nearer ev-
ery second a patter of feet made me swing
round and there his face white with ter-
ror was one of the overalled assistants
he stepped up to the chinaman and poured
forth a string of incoherent language that
for a moment eluded even his countryman
then i saw ho mings face turn a sickly
green his eyes protruded and he barked
back a question into the others face and i
distinctly heard the name ktai then
without a word ho ming turned on his heel
and side by side lhe two raced for the
main building as fast as they could move
leaving me standing wide-eyed with amaze-
ment

a moment laler i was joined by my com-
panions and to them  explained the sudden
departure of the chinaman as i spoke
several big drops of rain commenced to
fall and dr clovelly glanced anxiously at
flie sky hullo he ejaculated heres
that storm that you promised us follans-
bee
the gland men of the island



but that gentleman jumped to his feet
as though he had been stung storm be
damned he exclaimed that storm is a
number one size typhoon and it is heading
this way i give it five seconds to strike
the island

the terrific upheaval of nature lasted
three hours and to us adventurers
crouched in the groaning swaying forest
it was the final denounement of our astound-
ing adventures on the island of the gland
men towards evening the hurricane
dropped but the rain poured down with un-
bridled fury sweeping and lashing the ve-
getation before it such a deluge it is al-
most impossible to describe rather it was
as though the skies had opened and the sev-
en seas poured their waters through the gap
even in the thick of the matted vegetation
we were drenched to the skin and it was
almost dark when we eventually crawled
forth from our shelter and took our last look
at the island the downpour had abated
somewhat but it still swept in our faces
with the sting of a whip-iash and at length
wet half-blinded and weighed down by the
weight of our sodden garments we gazed
at what had once been the realization of a
fanatics dream

such a scene of destruction and chaos
beggars description the sturdy buildings
had been swept away like match boxes be-
fore a summer breeze the heaps of wood
and iron were still faintly smouldering and
when i remembered the volatile chemicals
that were ranged along the shelves  per-
cived that combustion must have wrecked
quite as many of the edifices as the howling
typhoon

there was the half-erected framework
now splintered and scattered there too
the poor dumb beasts that had once been
men the cataclysm had burst upon them
before their bestial minds had time to real-
ize its significance the rain swept merci-
lessly down on the inanimate hairy bodies
as though gloating in its power over mere
mortals

the high stockade was by some miracle
still standing in places in other places it
gaped open showing the destruction within

the walls here the bodies were piled
corpses torn scratched and bitten telling of
the panic that must have enveloped the com-
munity as it fought for freedom i won-
dered if any of the hideous denizens of the
underground pit had escaped but a glance
assured me ihe ruins of the main build-
ing were piled feet high over the vault of
horror

of ho ming there was no sign it was
impossible that he had lived through the
chaos that had enveloped the island but it
was hardly probable that everyone was
dead we to be sure only owed our lives
to our sheltered positions but there might
have been others

the island must have been situated in
the very centre of the catastrophe otherwise
there was no manner of accounting for the
terrible amount of damage it seemed
strange-ironical-that the toil and labour
of a decade should thus be destroyed in a
few hours the chinamans scheme had
been a marvel of completeness but the best-
laid plans-

we retraced our steps in silence each one
a little chastened by the tragedy that we
had passed through we were nearly to the
beach when  put the question

what made the chinaman rush away like
he did  asked follansbee he turned a
sickly colour and went for his life

didnt you say that you heard his fath-
ers name mentioned the big man asked
well its obvious that the servant told him
of the coming storm and he rushed off to
comfort and protect his father the pater-
nal reverence is very strongly developed in
the oriental races and he evidently cared
for nothing as long as his father was safe
recollect that all he had was made possible
by the sacrifice of his parents

we had reached the electric launch
beached high and dry where we had left it
as we swung it round i voiced the unspoken
question of the trio

will anyone believe us i ruminated
when we tell them where we have been
and what we have seen i very much
doubt that i would were a person to re-
count to me the-

went wrong


the soulless entity



marvin martinoff was what might
have been teamed a contriver of
queer contraptions his home his labora-
tory and his office were cluttered with
clockwork radio and motor-operated jim-
cracks and his life was
filled with plans for
more and more odd
mechanical devices

some of the machines
had earned vast sums
for the inventor

others were useless ex-
cept as proofs of the
workability of mar-
tinoffs weird theories

if it had not been
for his robots which
were among i h e
worlds greatest labor-
saving machines mar-
tmoff probably would
have been sent down
as a crank but there
was no gainsaying his
genius he was re-
garded with a degree
of respect and awe by
others in his field

that a grim and
frightful tragedy lurk-
ed in the junk-like clut-
ter of martinoffs sur-
roundings was sus-
pected by  one

nor did anybody even
dream the strange de-
velopments which were
to result from his ex-
periments until one
stormy night in sep-
tember

yet it is not so
strange that fate should
play pranks when giv-
en such a heterogen-
eous mass of material
to work with indeed fate and destiny
must have been sorely tempted by the clut-
ter of these weird devices which seemed half
human and half machine

like the planets martinoffs habits were

so regular that his movements could be pre-
dicted accurately in advance each day he
worked in his laboratory and shop from ele-
ven a m until five each night after din-
ner he worked at his home from seven until
heaven knows when
he was at his office
only by appointment
and these business ap-
pointments were few-
for they usually bored
him beyond expres-
sion

his only close asso-
ciate dr bliss far-

	um was strikingly in
contrast to him far-
num was a surgeon
who worked in blood
nerves bone tissue
and muscle while
martinoff was working
in metal dr farnum
had a flair for radio
and was quite an adept
in this new science
which fact had brought
the two together in a
fast enduring friend-
ship

when the dread
thing happened that
forms the basis of this
strange story martiu-
off was alone in his
home

he had just com-
pleted a new mechani-
cal man fashioned
of inert material it was
quite human in shape
and appearance it
had a wax facc blink-
ing electric eyes and a
phonographic voice
which could be ampli-
fied to an altogether
inhuman volume

on that fateful rainy night the metal mon-
ster stood back near the walls its metal
arms extended as if in greeting its electric
orbs blinking martinoff sat at his desk

r tt is only in the past few
 years that we have
learned how much like a
very complicated bit of
mechanism we are as far
as our physical processes
are concerned there is noth-
ing mysterious or meta-
physical at all and many
scientists confidently assert
that artificial organs can
be installed to work as well
or even better than our
natural ones thus arti-
ficial hearts have been used
successfully on animals and
their application to human
beings is predicted next

but it is a far cry from
the substitution of physical
organs to the use of arti-
ficial means of stimulating
brain impulses except for
our purely abstract
thoughts our brains work
because of the stimuli sent
to them throughnerveseach
of the hundreds of thou-
sands of nerve ends has the
possibility when stimulated
of sending a message to the
brain to do or not to do
some act but suppose it
were possible to send such
stimuli artificially and by
appropriate means to even
control the response of the
brain then we have a
complete control over a
mans mind and body and
perhaps over his - soul
that is the theme of this
 very unusual story


wonder stories

opposite browsing over ancient scientific
lore the robot controlled by radio im-
pulse could count add subtract multi-
ply recite the lords prayer and do a good
days manual labor but as has been said
on this particular night it simply stood there
with its back toward the wall

it was in full tune and its electric eyes
appeared to be staring banefullv at the full-
ness of martinoffs throat on the table
was a long keen bladed turkish knife used
by martinoff to open his mail

such is the scene in martinoffs study as
it was reconstructed after sudden and bloody
murder had been done

to assist him in fashioning mechanical
things a work i loved

sometimes he would upbraid me for
stupidity in fashioning metal parts but al-
ways with a kindly fatherly air invariably
he would reward me after such scoldings
with an extra dollar or two i had every-
thing i wanted i could draw on the bank
for any sums necessary for my own use or
for the use of the house but i did not take
advantage of this i assure you

outside of bawling you out what did he
ever say to you that might throw light on this
case asked the detective

very little once after calling me
dumb he said its only the brainiest men
who know how really
dumb they are anoth-
er favorite remark of his
was otto a man should
be big enough to be little
enough to be big he
admitted the remark was
not original sir-

never mind all that
boloney broke in the
detective tell us just
what happened the night
he was killed

it was a miserable
night otto began tear-
fully i had been ner-
vous and upset he had
left word that he was not
to be disturbed and i was
just aching for conversa-
tion it was so dreary i get that way
sometimes-

will you tell us just what happened
exploded the detective with an oath

i was telling you sir i-

well then go ahead martinoff was
right you are dumb

otto looked hurt but proceeded

it was my habit to serve him a cup of
tea and some dry sausage and rye bread or
a bite of some kind at midnight on night
when he worked you know that thing
that robot it could say the lords prayer

 was about to enter the room after knocking
as was my habit i had the tray on my hand
then it happened 

utside the rain fell
in sheets and drip-
ped dismally from the
gabled eaves and turrets
of the old fashioned
house the wind moan-
ed and whistled

otto marlinoffs per-
sonal attendant-the only
servant on duty that
night-said later that he
had been obsessed by an
uncanny fear all evening
and at times had felt like
rushing screaming from
the quaint old house

he told this story tear-
fully haltingly and it
had the ring of truth des-
pite its almost unbelieva-
ble character when questioned by detec-
tives he said i loved martinoff with a de-
votion that i cannot describe though he
hardly said a word to me from one weeks
end to the other he seemed to be working
but he was so good to me

in what way asked a brusque sergeant
of detectives

well replied otto with a wistfulness
in iris voice when i fled from russia and
arrived here penniless i sought him out be-
cause his father and mine had been neigh-
bors in moscow

he took me in and paid me well he
made it possible for me to attend school and
learn the language and allowed me at times

what happened

i heard the machine screech out it
yelled sir-

yelled what

it yelled our father who art in heav-
en-the it gurgled sir it gurgled mech-
anically and just then i heard a groan a hu-
man groan sir and i heard a body fall i
was nervous i was all upset i was fright-
ened i did a most unmanly thing sir i
dropped the tray there at the door and ran
wildly out in the rain

where did you go

nowhere i just ran out probably fifty
feet from the house then i stopped and
looked back my knees were trembling
my heart was pounding and my head was
hot but the rain must have cooled me off
some for i realized what a coward i had
been and i went back to the house then
steeling my courage i entered and you know
what was there-

what was there

just the way it was after i phoned you
rnd you came in dripping and arrested me

the tragedy reconstructed

the detective was blustering with impa-
tience he banged his fist on a desk
and swore full well-rounded oaths he
walked up and down while others at the
grilling sat and watched him and while ot-
to waved back and forth in his chair his
hands to his head

suddenly the detective banged his big
fist on a table around which the inquisitors
and the prisoner sat and commanded
tell us what you saw before we got
there

otto was jarred out of his fit of emotion
he raised his haggard thin angular features
to the detective and pleaded do i have to
go all over that again

absolutely and damn quick thundered
the detective otto proceeded

my poor master was lying at the foot of
the thing-the horrible blinking man-mach-
ine the knife was there beside him the
wound was on his neck blood was on the
floor on his head was another wound it
bled too i looked at the machine and there

on its outstretched metal hand was blood
sir blood and a tuft of human hair

i liked all but falling where i stood i
trembled and cried out i moved about
some blit i was conscious that i should not
disturb anything then i forced myself to
action and phoned you sir i phoned you
that murder had been done i did not go
back in the room the rest you know
the detective had heard otto tell this story
probably twenty times each time he told
it tlie details were exactly the same there
was not the slightest discrepancy

well thats that said the detective ser-
geant and otto was led back to a cell

turning to his co-workers tlie detective
sergeant said with conviction that guy is
telling the gods truth and you cant try a
machine for murder

you mean the robot committed the mur-
der asked a thoughtful individual sitting
at the end of the table

i do it is hard to believe but what else
is there to believe that machine was too
human to be safe it had everything hu-
man but a heart and braia and a human
widiout a heart and a brain might be ex-
pected to commit murder

answering the look incredulity on all
the faces he added i mean this martinoff
was fooling with the mechanism he evi-
dently put the knife in the robots hand
and caused the arm to raise why i dont
know then something went wrong and the
arm descended the metal of the hand
brushed the side of martinoffa head cutting
the scalp and tearing loose a tuft of hair
and the knife was driven into martinoffs
neck martinoff tjien fell against the mach-
ine probably he tripped over a wire and
jarring some mechanism this caused the
robot to cry out in an amplified voice and
it caused the hand to open and drop the
knife to the floor

martinoff of course dropped like a log
death came within a few minutes while otto
was running around without enough pres-
ence of mind to know what to do

odd as was this explanation of the death
it was the one generally accepted by the
newspapers and public and in due time
otto was released from custody


wonder stories

there was one person however who did
not accept this explanation of the crime
this single disbeliever in the mechanical
murder theory was dr farnum closest
friend of martinoff he determined to
solve the mystery by a method which was as
bizarre fantastical and unearthly as the un-
canny crime itself he gave up his surgical
practice and devoted all his time to delv-
ing into what appeared to him as the un-
solved mystery of martinoffs murder

his first act in this direction was to hire
otto immediately on his release from jail
he gave him a position as attendant in his
household and later placed him under the
direction of a woman nurse a miss hilda
spencer the nurse was ordered to in-
struct otto in the rudiments of nursing
both miss spence and otto thought this an
unusual arrangement but they followed in-
structions without comment miss spence
a beautiful blonde type at first believed
otto to be of ordinary intelligence she
was destined to learn later that he was real-
ly quite an intelligent fellow and that he
fairly absorbed information

the truth was that otto while dog-like in
faithful service was of good blood and
came from a family well-educated in rus-
sia he was anxious to advance in his new
world and was tireless in his efforts to grasp
the learning that would fit him as a practi-
cal nurse he was agreeable had a pleas-
ing personality

chapter h
the confession

it was three months after otto had come
into the household of dr farnum that
the surgeon called him into conference
otto found miss spence already seated and
was glad that she was to hear whatever the
doctor had to say

you two began the surgeon without
preliminaries are to assist me in a most
unusual-i might say startling and unheard
of experiment-and you must not fail me
if you do it will mean endless trouble and
criticism for all of us

the two merely nodded their assent and
the doctor proceeded

otto he said i have never felt right
about the killing of my friend martinoff
or should i call it a murder i positively
do not believe that he was killed by his
strange man-machine as the coroner finally
decided i am going to tell you of a con-
versation  had with martinoff the last time
we were together and from it you will gath-
er what we now have ahead of us

martinoff and i were dining at the
science club he told me he had perfected
his new man-machine and for reasotis of my
own i was interested more than you might
imagine when he had explained the
mechanism in detail i told him of an idea
 had long had in mind

 mechanical engineers i said are busy
making men of machines and i believe it
would be possible for me to make a machine
out of a man

what how do you mean he asked
and his voice rang with incredulity

 you know i said that i am a deep
student of radio and i believe every man has
in his nervous system a complete radio re-
ceiving set that could be hooked up with
platinum wires to a mechanical instrument
or instruments that would cause the human
to register and act upon radio impulses i
do not mean for him to respond to the trans-
formed waves or spoken word but the actual
hertzian waves before they are transformed
into sound waves

 quite interesting commented martin-
off why dont you go ahead and make such
a machine-man

 because i replied to do so i would
have to kill out the will or the volition of the
man before he would cease to be a thinking
human and before he could be a machine in
the flesh ethics would hardly permit of
such vivisection i explained and i had oth-
er compunctions i explained that i had
already invented a unit which could be used
in such an experiment but that i had hesita-
ted to use it even on larger species of dumb
animals

i have brought you two here now to tell
you that cthics no longer figure in this mat-
ter and my compunctions have fled i am
the soulless entity



going to find the man who murdered my
friend martinoff and when  do he will be
the subject of my experiments if these ex-
periments are successful this criminal will
become the first mechanically operated hu-
man being the world has ever known

it will really serve him right and will
be good for him because by depriving him
of his free will and volition i will have
curbed his criminal tendencies i also will
have made him a useful machine capable of
heavy manual labor without the sense or the
desire to protest against his fate do i
make myself quite clear

i follow you said the girl

i am at your service said otto but
how do you propose lo find this suspected
murdered and how do you propose to prove
his guilt beyond question

leave that to me said the surgeon fin-
ally and then he brought forth a small
round object with attached wires look
he said and behold my impulsaphone with
which i propose to transform a human be-
ing into a machine

otto and miss spence were all interest
they beheld a small object which re-
sembled the receiving unit of a telephone
otto noted that the attached wires were of
platinum and that they were frayed at the
ends like frayed out string into many ends
of fine wire they were so fine in fact as
to be almost microscopic each multiple
wire end was again frayed or divided into
hundreds of additional fine terminals
when dr farnum saw otto examining these
minute wires he said

the ends of those wires correspond with
the branching out of tiny nerve lines from
a neurone or nerve cell it is my purpose
to plant this mass of branched wires at
points where they will interlace and com-
municate with important nerve centers in
the human body

it will be a painful operation but the
pain will pass as the system becomes accus-
tomed to the new conditions the nervous
system is simply a telephone system anyway
with the brain as the central office and the
nerve centers as the branch exchanges and
the nerves as the wires

in the human body there are many bun-
dles of nerves or nerve trunks just as there
are trunks in a telephone system the lar-
gest nerve trunk is the spinal column and i
will extend minute platinum wires to every
important nerve center and ganglion this
means we will hook up with the spinal cord
at every vertebrae and that tiny platinum
wires will be planted at all important re-
flex and other nerve centers

many surgical operations under a com-
plete anesthetic will be necessary and that
is all that you two need to know at pre-
sent now we will go about finding the
killer

the surgeon was addressing his remarks
to otto but he had known miss spence long
enough to be sure she would not miss a
word and that she needed no special in-
struction 

you saw no one in the house on the
night martinoff met his death

no one said otto and his words were
positive

yet said the doctor there was some-
one there he paused for his words to
have their effect

how do you know inquired otto sur-
prised

i know said the doctor slowly that
there was someone hiding in the room with
martinoff and that he came there before the
downpour of rain started

how do you know insisted otto

i know because the machine could not
have killed martinoff in the manner des-
cribed and if the killer had entered before
the rain started he would have left his
marks-wet ones it was a heavy rain

some man killed martinoff evidently
for revenge he was hiding in the room
when you entered after the crime and he left
when you ran from the house you ran
out the front way he ran out the back
he had a car waiting near the lower road
and made his escape back to new york
that is my theory

quite possible agreed otto but i real-
ly do not know why are you sure that it
was a man

because of the great force of the blow
i have treated hundreds of knife wounds


wonder stories

and experience and observation proves that
wounds inflicted by a weapon in the hands
of a woman are different from those in-
flicted by a man

 i see said otto

now listen otto began the doctor
again seriously you can help me by fill-
ing in the gaps in my deductions we all
believe the doctor had no enemies now 
want to know who were his visitors who
came regularly to his house

nobody emphatically asserted otto
o yes there was someone said the sur-
geon with assurance

no one

now think

i am thinking there was no one at all
no-  maybe you mean the typist the
girl that was strange she came once in
a while in the evening when martinoff had
notes he wanted to set down

i thought so observed the surgeon with
evident satisfaction tell us all about her
you see we are working by an old rule-
first find the woman now what about
her

i dont know much about her you said
a man did it this is a woman a woman
typist

the woman will lead us to the man
said the surgeon tell us about her i
have reason to suspect someone well ac-
quainted with martinoffs habits and the
room where the murder was committed
all i know was martinoff got her name
from a charity list she was from one of
the rougher districts she had a bad rec-
ord but was trying to go straight she said
martinoff gave her a chance she was pret-
ty in a rough way and seemed willing and
anxious to please she behaved well the
little i saw of her except she was given to
slang which nettled martinoff

did she ever act as though she was
trying to impress martinoff

no

or you

 no indeed why no sir

what was her name

dorothy dottie she liked to be called
her last name

i dont recall let me see it was a

russian name he got her from a russian
aid society the helping hand or something
like that let me see-no i cant recall

no need to decided the doctor look
her up tomorrow through this helping
hand agency when you get her name and
address i will engage detectives to get us
all further information we may require
good night to both of you when  have
anything further of interest  will confide
in you

setting the trap

it was just one week after otto obtained
the required name and address that dr
farnum received a report from his detec-
tive agency	

dot borsovich reputed russian
agitator and red served eighteen
months on the island for a confidence
game her male accomplice escaped
detection has only one male admir-
er an old friend who knew her in
russia he is nick solokoff big and
burly but auiet mannered they at-
tend radical meetings but their only
real interest is in quick and easy mon-
ey the man is a lucky gambler
politics with them appears to be a
subterfuge to hide their real activities
solokoff has no police record but is
known in the underworld as a badger
worker a form of crime involving a
confidence game followed by extortion
at the point of a gun

i thought so said dr farnum after
reading the report

a few nights later dr farnum sat in a
russian restaurant he appeared to be
waiting for someone

the scene about him was one of wild
gaiety laughter was loud and quips of a
rough nature were being exchanged with
abandon and it was apparent that more
than food was being dispensed a gypsy
string band was playing and the dancing
space in the center was crowded the form
of dancing was anything but refined no
one could be a stranger long in such a
place

the surgeon assumed the air of one thor-
oughly familiar with such scenes and heart-
ily in sympathy with the crowd more than
one feminine glance was directed at his
the soulless entity



table this ogling he appeared to accept
in good nature but with no further en-
couragement soon a large florid man en-
tered with a frowzy female

once they were seated dr farnum called
a waiter and sent over a note scribbled on a
prescription blank the printed head of
which he was careful lo lear off the note
read

i am told you can take me to the house
of alex the greek i will pay you well
for your trouble

the big russian scanned the note the
waiter furtively indicated the doctors
table taking leave of the trowzy female
abruptly the big russian after scanning
the surgeon suspiciously came-over to hia
table	

the surgeon bubbled with an affability
which immediately disarmed suspicion
the russian sat down

where did you get the idea that i knew
alex the greek he asked

simple chortled the surgeon i play
once in a while for high stakes a dealer
in the cottage club told me i would find
you here and that you would introduce me
at the place of alex where i am told they
can cover big bets you are nick solok-
off are you not

who wants to know

well it doesnt matter who you are
can you make il possible for me to risk a
few thousand at the place of alex replied
the surgeon with an air of one entirely at
peace with the world

nothing easier said the russian but
where do i come in

i will stake you with one hundred dol-
lars said dr farnum and besides should
i win i will declare you in for one half the
winnings my car is outside waiting
shall we go

on our way replied the russian with
a great laugh for ihe surgeons affability
was not only disarming but was also con-
tagious

a little drink before we go question-
ed the surgeon

youre on agreed the russian

the drinks were served just as the big

russian reached for his drink the surgeon
distracted his attention by a remark

who is lhat important individual back
of the desk he asked

ihe big russian turned half around and
as he did the surgeon dropped a white pow-
der in his drink

o thats old ivan himself he owns
ihe place

quite an interesting character said
the doctor as they quaffed their liquor and
left the place the russian waving a fare-
well to the female he was leaving behind

chapter iii
a strange proposal

the two piled into the doctors car
which was waiting with otto at the
wheel the russian gave an address and
the car sped away within a few minutes
he was unconscious from the drug admin-
istered in his drink and was leaning heav-
ily on the surgeons shoulder dr far-
num was satisfied that at last he had the
murderer of his friend helpless and com-
pletely in his power

he was not vindictive or revengeful but
neither was he in a frame of mind to adopt
gentle methods in what he had determined
to accomplish if solokoff had been con-
scious and could have realized the fate in
store for him he would probably have chos-
en a quick death rather than to yield to
his terrible destiny

otto drove directly to the offices of the
famous surgeon solokoff was laid on an
operating table in the room used by the sur-
geon for his private patients and was se-
curely strapped down then nature was
allowed to lake its course and in due time
solokoff doomed to be ihe subject in one
of ihe most astounding experiments ever
recorded in human annals awoke he
looked about him in a dazed manner

keep still it will do you no good to make
an outcry were the first words he heard
and it was dr farnum who was speaking

solokoff added ihe surgeon purposely
toning his voice lo a deep and ominous note
you murdered my friend


wonder stories

solokoff who could not see who was
speaking did not answer but there was a
visible straining at his bonds his head
ached from the effects of the drug and his
vitality was low he was in the right state
for a severe and successful grilling the
deep uncanny voice continued

martinoff was a scientist you killed
him and to atone you will now sign a paper
before witnesses giving your body after
death to the advancement of science you
will sign now if you do not you will die
a horrible death within a few hours i
have you at my mercy

ill see you in hell before i sign any-
thing blurted the russian his voice in-
tensely agitated

if you sign i will see that dot goes free
if you do not sign we will send dot to the
chair with you now lets see what kind
of a man you are

i will sign said solokoff in a tired
voice but i aint dead yet remember
that

a document which had been prepared and
kept in readiness was produced and otto
miss spence and a notary public were sum-
moned

dr farnum addressed them simply this
patient wishes to sign his will in which he
gives his body to science after his death

one arm of the patient was released
he was handed the paper and a fountain
pen and without a word he signed the docu-
ment you may go now said dr farnum
turning to the others i intend to operate
immediately they turned to depart the
surgeon had mentioned operating to note
the effect of his words on the russian

solokoff strained at his bonds and started
to cry out in his native tongue

keep still said the deep voice again
keep still or i will kill you the face
of the russian was ashen he made no
furtlier outcry he was able to half turn
his head and as he did so he saw his ac-
quaintance of the restaurant amazement
clouded his features

you he half questioned with an oath

yes i am dr farnum lifelong friend of
martinoff and it is with me you will have
to deal

solokoff noted that the doctor had a hy-
podermic syringe in his hands he heard
farnum go lo the phone and call the police
saying that he had the murderer of martin-
off in custody again he strained heavily
at his bonds but an instant later the hypo-
dermic syringe was forced home in one of
his arms gradually he sank into a deep
sleep

the confession

the detective sergeant who had handled
the martinoff case soon arrived with
four assistants otto and miss spence were
summoned

addressing the detective dr farnum said
slowly officer  have taken the liberty to
administer to this prisoner a liberal dosage
of scopolamine the truth-compelling drug
and under its influence you will hear a con-
fession of martinoffs murder should the
court refuse lo admit ihis confession in evi-
dence we still have other evidence of a
damning nature

my detectives found this mans finger
prints on the sides of martinoffs robot
his revolver which he feared to use will
be found in a westchester county storm
sewer the proprietor and five men in a
pool room were approached by this man in
an attempt to arrange an alibi my detec-
tives threatened the six with arrest for con-
spiracy and they signed affidavits telling
the whole and the true story

whats the idea of tieing him up this
way and filling him full of dope asked
the detective why didnt you call us
sooner

i called you as soon as was feasible
replied the surgeon in a tone that brooked
no interference he was my patient be-
fore he was your prisoner and i wanted to
hear the story from his own lips i have
faith in scopolamine and under its influ-
ence he will tell us the complete story

the patient already had begun to talk

i didnt intend to kill him began the
confession low and clear and in russian

talk english commanded the surgeon

i did not mean to kill him began the
voice this time in english
the soulless entity



begin at the beginning commanded the
surgeon

the story was clear and connected

it was a badger game the badger
game is lo get some prominent and
wealthy man as a victim the victim is
forced into a compromising position with a
woman and the man posing as the womans
husband rushes in with accusations and in
a great rage he demands prompt payment
for his injured feelings and backs his de-
mand by flourishing a revolver there is
no idea to commit murder and when a mur-
der results it is because the victim shows
fight or messes things up so that the man
has to kill him to get away

using a charity dodge dot borsovich
would get employment with men of money
and then  would come along and shake him
down for as much as i could get

martinoff paid no attention to dot out-
side of business and we couldnt frame him
with a badger racket so i decided to stick
him up and get what i could i had been
losing heavily at gambling and we had to
have some money

dot let me in early in the evening and
i hid behind that damned iron man it was
that crazy praying metal thing that got on
my nerves when martinoff started it
counting and saying prayers it got me and
i couldnt move once he ordered it lo
walk and i thought i was going to stand
clearly revealed but the thing just took a
few steps forward and then back it kept
between me and martinoff and he did not
see me

the rain and the whir of the insides of
the robot got me plum crazy i was hop-
ing he would go to bed and let me gel out
but he didnt he came lo the machine
and reached around it and touched me
he reached in then and caught me arid i put
my gun in my pocket and grabbed him
he started to fight and i heard a noise like
footsteps coming closer and closer i was
afraid to shoot so i jumped to the tabic and
grabbed the knife and brought it down on
his neck he fell against the thing striking
his head against its outstretched hand then
slid to the floor

that thing that damned iron man with

the blinking eyes and wax face it wobbled
then hell if it didnt shout our father
who art in heaven i grabbed it to steady
it then i wiped the handle of the knife
with my handkerchief to remove finger
prints but i forgot lo wipe the metal sides
of the machine where i touched it

the form on the operating table stirred
restlessly and the others in the room shud-
dered

i was so scared continued the voice
that i nearly dropped dead there i stood
looking at martinoff bleeding and that
damned thing thal iron man with white wax
face and wobbling arms looked straight at
me and blinked and blinked then i heard
a knock on the door

i made one jump out the window and
ran down the back gravel path and through
the bushes to where dot was waiting in the
car all ihat time in the rain she started
to cuss me and i said for gods sake dot
keep still i killed him she started to
whimper i slowed up at the first storm
sewer threw ihe gun down and came to
new york i didnt breathe easy again
night or day and  went around and saw
the gang and tried to frame up an alibi
then ihe cops said the machine killed mar-
tinoff and i felt safe again

that was all dr farnum turned to ihe
detectives he is your man- he said
he will be awake in about ten minutes
the trial was not long and dot was called
only as a witness on the advice of her
man she told the truth and as a states wit-
ness she was given her freedom after the
trial a month later solokoff was eletro-
cuted and as ihe body was carried from ihe
dealh chamber it was delivered into the
hands of dr farnum who had an ambu-
lance waiting

otlo and miss spence were with dr far-
num there was a wild rush and scurry
as the body was being carried from the
death chamber dr farnuru- leaned over it
and injected a drug of his own discovery a
drug twenty times more powerful than ad-
renalin which heretofore was the most pow-
erful of all heart stimulants

in the ambulance the doctor and his as-


wonder stories

sistants watched the dead man with bated
breath the doctor said i am afraid we
have failed then he hurriedly injected
another dose of the life-giving drug

there was a few minutes of soul rending
anxiety and suddenly the man once dead re-
turned to life he opened his eyes slowly
his lungs expanded and he took a deep
breath

dr farnum who had one hand on that
of miss spence gripped her until she cried
out with pain

we have conquered he said slowly
almost professionally i knew  was right
electrocution does not really destroy life
it merely shocks the heart so that it stops
beating and if nothing is done about it
of course the body decays my dose stim-
ulates the heart to activity again and like
the nurse that she was the girl replied
without emotion

it is a success

otto burst into enthusiastic excited com-
ments and was sternly silenced by the doc-
tor

the patient has painful burns where the
electrodes came in contact with his skin
said dr farnum we will have to nurse
him carefully he is too valuable to lose
now that we have resurrected him

for the next few weeks solokoff was kept
bound and guarded careful nursing had
resulted in the healing of his wounds and
dr farnum was ready to perform his great
experiment solokoff aware of what was
to happen to him ceased to protest once he
was assured that he would not be deprived
of his life

otto and miss spence assisted the doctor
in the operations which extended over a per-
iod of several weeks local and at times
complete anesthesia were used to relieve as
much as possible the patient from feeling
any pain during the actual operations
soothing drugs were administered to help
him endure his sufferings while the many
wounds made by the doctors instruments
were healing

dr farnum first severed certain nerves
causing paralysis of parts of the brain con-
trolling will and volition this completed
he had a word to say lo miss spence who

had begun to protest against his planned
procedure

my dear girl he said humane scrup-
les are one thing and common sense is an-
other this man has been dead at death
the soul is supposed to flee the body if
this is true our subject is a body without
a soul

in depriving him of free will i have
removed his inborn or acquired criminal
tendencies he is harmless to himself and
what is more important he cannot now go
about harming others of his fellow men
before i operated he was a menace to so-
ciety now he is harmless inarticulate
inoffensive animal when  am finished
he will be one-fourth animal and three-
fourths machine under the term of his
will i have the right to operate and i cant
bring myself to sympathize with him i am
going ahead if you care to withdraw
from the case you may do so and i will
get another nurse if you decide to con-
tinue you will have a chance to learn much
you are not so wise that you can afford
to throw away a chance like this

miss spence was in the habit of permit-
ting dr farnum to decide matters for her
and so it was in this instance when they
were finished solokoff was a human radio
set tuned to receive hertzian waves at a
frequency of twenty thousand kilocycles
since dr farnum controlled a portable
short-wave radio station licensed to broad-
cast on this frequency the experiment stood
ready for a test

for the mechanically inclined a des-
cription of this human radio receiver might
not be amiss

on his head resting like a helmet was a
large metal covering with a space cut away
for ihe exposure of the russians face
resting atop the helmet and giving him a
satyr-like appearance were two metal rods
extending about a foot out on either side
around them were hundreds of turns of a
fine metal wire the helmet held also a
number of other queer devices the nature of
which farnum did not explain to his lay
assistants but to them the things were suf-
ficiently awe-inspiring to have an import-
ant place in the doctors plans
the soulless entity



exposed by his open shirt there was a
dial control and leading from this there
began the fine wires that were to send the
nerve impulses through to his nerve end
if he were undrased he might with the
thousands of glistening wires over him have
presented the appearance of same strange
nightmare-like horror but farnum with an
eye to the aesthetic had covered up as much
of the terrible as possible

between his shoulder blades and extend-
ing downward almost to the waist was a thin
metal box containing the other necessary
parts of the equipment the power units
were carried rn his pockets and could be
hooked up to him when he was finally
dressed he was indeed a living breathing
man-machine without volition without a
thought or desire that was not impressed on
him by farnums radio broadcaster fur-
thermore if theologians are to be believed
he was without a soul

to farnums friends an exclusive
coterie of savants of high standing solokoff
the human radio machine was a scientific
sensation he was exhibited to the chosen
few and allowed to carry out practically all
the functions of a normal human being but
only on impulses broadcast by dr far-
num

he was unable to feel pain joy des-
pair or grief-and he could not feel even
the pangs of hunger if it were not for the
fact that he was regularly impelled by hert-
zian waves to take nourishment he would
have starved to death but without pain or
without emotion his life depended on the
batteries carried in the pockets of his cloth-
ing and on the will of dr farnum

after traveling about the world with his
strange machine for several years dr far-
num accompanied by otto and miss spence
returned to new york but they had not
been home a week before dire events on
which they had uot reckoned at all began
to occur

in some manner probably through a leak
in the prisons dot borsovich learned that
her man had been resurrected by dr far-
num after death in the electric chair

dot had gone from bad to worse and had
come to be known in the underworld as the

gorilla woman because of her cruel and re-
lentless nature in dealing with victims and

enemies

for months she had been waiting and
waiting-her whole life set only on the re-
turn of dr farnum that she might at least
see and talk to her man

on their return solokoff was kept in a
small tiled room over dr farnums private
garage he was given regular exercise and
nourishment and was permitted to do small
tasks such as washing dr farnums cars
and puttering about the garden at times
he was taken out and exhibited to scientists
upon whom farnum relied to keep his sec-
ret

the gorilla woman took to hanging about
the country premises of dr farnum and
was nol long in learning where her man
was lodged by dint of much clever
scheming she finally made her way into hie
quarters in the garage and there ensued a
scene and a situation without precedent

in describing it later to dr farnum and
otto the gorilla woman said

i threw myself in his arms but he was
blind to me he paid no attention at all
i fell to the floor and grabbed his legs and
begged him to talk to me and he just didnt
seem to know i was there i climbed up to
his lips and kissed him and he was as oold
as if he had been dead i bflat at his chest
and he toppled over on a cot and just laid
there staring up his eyes dead and not
moving i ran my hands over him and his
pockets bulged with boxes with wires on
them i unbuttoned his vest and shirt and
he had wires running all over him but he
breathed he was dead and he actually
breathed my gawd it was awful i
screamed out and i guess  fainted when
i came to my senses i was in a bed and you
was standing over me

the doctor had found her there in the
garage he had carried her into the house
and had revived her after placing her on
the bed half delirious she had told him
of her meeting with her man

patiently the doctor told the woman the
truth he went into minute details couch-
ing his account in simple words the wo-

in three parts

part two

now go on with the story

a gong rang sharply in the engine-
room four attendants took their
places quickly each beside a pair of the
generators in turn they called a series of
readings from instruments before them
through speaking tubes to the pilot house
this langley told us was a check on the
pilots instruments the gong sounded
twice the generators slackened their speed
and for a second quiet reigned then there
was a hissing from the interior well which
rose to a shriek the tractor quivered and
from the increased pressure of my feet on
the floor i knew we were off looking
through a window at our backs we saw the
jagged surface of the moon sinking rapidly
below us we gained speed upward for
several seconds then the hum of the gen-
erators increased as the rising temperature
of the synthium was checked we were
now traveling upward at some thirty miles
an hour it took us but a couple of minutes
to reach an elevation of a mile or more

a new sound directed our attention to
two great gyroscopes which tilted through
an angle of thirty degrees inclining the
tractor to one side we now started off
in this direction gaining speed constantly

until even at our elevation the ground
slipped by at an amazing rate

our window was a little off the direct
line of flight but we had a good view of
the patli before us many miles ahead we
caught a glimpse of that tell-tale blue-yel-
low light from the other tractor which had
started off ahead of us we were rapidly
overhauling it gaining speed continually
for there was nothing to retard our pro-
gress and the discharge gave us a constant
acceleration presently we came up with
the other machine and passed it spouting
its trail of glowing gas a mile or two on
our left its pilot was taking his time
having slanted the machine less than ours
it dropped back and presently was lost to
our view

estimating our acceleration i calculated
that we were now traveling at nearly seven
hundred miles per hour we passed over
a range of mountains whose tops were
within a few hundred feet of our elevation
and i began speculating as to the conse-
quence of a collision with them perhaps
the pilot entertained similar thoughts as
at this moment the gyroscopes began to
swing back to vertical it was mistaken




wonder stories

however ae they continued their motion
including at an angle of thirty degrees in
the opposite direction we must be half-
way to the mine and in the absence of
friction as much energy would be required
to stop as to reach our preesnt velocity

looking out the window again we saw
the ground below us now tilted at a differ-
ent angle it was difficult to dismiss the
idea that we were
climbing by looking
downward we saw the
cloud of gas from the
synthium preceding us
and  obscuring the
ground immediately
below us as we con-
tinued slackening our
speed constantly i
wondered how a land-
ing could be made
with the view thus ob-
structed i did not
wonder long however
so when our velocity
had been reduced to
about twenty miles an
hour the hum of the
generators rose the
roar of the gas became
less violent and we
began to descend a
moment later the gy-
roscopes turned verti-
cal and we drifted
slowly forward under
momentum dropping
rapidly

we could now see
the air-locks to the
mine projecting above
the ground a short dis-
tance ahead the rale
of our fall increased until it seemed to me
that the machine must be shattered the
ground was alarmingly close the gas cloud
had already begun to flatten out along the
rocky plain then at the last moment our
speed was checked and we drifted at a snails
pace a few feet above the ground the sur-
face itself was invisible but its nearness
could be seen in the behavior of the gas

we descended gently the last few feet land-
ing with hardly a quiver

langley and wiley had already begun to
put on their air-envelopes and i quickly
followed suit it now struck me that al-
though my helmet was sound-proof the hum
of the generators was plainly audible their
note was the characteristic whine of elec-
trical machinery faithfully reproduced by
my radio receiver

we hurried down
through the empty
compartment below
and onto the surface
of the moon the air-
locks lay a short dis-
tance before us and
the mechanics were
already on their way
there as we ap-
proached a crowd of
men in air envelopes
came out of the larger
air-lock pushing
wheelbarrows full of
iron for the colonys
foundries we stood
by until the loading
was finished mean-
while the second trac-
tor appeared drop-
ping slowly from the
inky sky it nestled
down near the first
which had now receiv-
ed its cargo and was
preparing to take off
even at our distance
the note of the genera-
tors was quite evident
and its lessened vol-
ume foretold the blind-
ing rush of gas it
rose more and more rapidly to a great
height there was the faint rising whine
of ihe current as it tilted over on its return
journey meanwhile the second tractor had
taken the men aboard and it too rose in a
burst of blue-yellow flames higher and
higher faster and faster it went as if bent
on overtaking its companion its path

nr he first installment of 
- this thrilling interplan-
etary story opened up
many sources of wonder-
ment for the reader what
is this mysterious outpost
on the moon hiding away
from civilization and ful-
filling some unexplainable
mission are its motives
beneficial to the earth-or
is it the agent of some gi-
gantic attempt to control
our destinies from the bleak
surface of our satellite

the present the second
installment will reveal the
secret of many of the events
that have puzzled we will
find out if the outpost is a
menace or if it is itself
trying unknown to the
earth to contend with some
force that is directed
against the earth the
secret lies in the gigantic
brain of the mysterious
dr forscher and when he
speaks there will be set in
motion a series of astonish-
ing events that will take us
to the furthest limits of the
ksolar system
the outpost on the moon



through the eky was an irregular crazy
corkscrew

 heard langley mutter why doesnt the
fool stranghten out then the generators
hummed again faint and low at first but
higher and higher as they took up their
load louder higher they whined langley
watched anxiety written in his face sud-
denly they were silent langley waved his
arms shouting hes overloaded them hes
burned them out my god he cant stop
fascinated i watched the machine grow-
ing brighter receding further climbing in-
to the pitiless sky it was a tiny dot now
changing color turning red then white-
the color of molten metal

i turned away unable to watch longer
langley muttered

twenty men and one
fool pilot

slowly we turned to
the air-lock the me-
chanics were huddled
around the outside eye-
ing us some fearfully
some questioning a few
defiantly all no doubt
mindful of the return
trip for my part i was
half inclined lo risk walk-
ing back the tragedy
had affected us all and
it was a silent and mor-
ose group that followed
langley to the air plant

an audience
with forscher

a brief inspection was sufficient to de-
termine the nature of the breakdown
a valve leading from the mixer io the stor-
age tanks had jammed allowing the fresh-
ly generated air to escape into the mine
while the storage supply also leaked out
leaving no reserve the repairs necessitated
a complele shutting down of the plant and
while this would not have been dangerous
a the main colony because of its air-tight
construction the character of the mining
operations rendered it risky here a de-
posit of iron was being worked and while

some of the ore lay on the surface it was
the practice to sink a shaft beneath the ore
and work up it was manifestly impracti-
cal to give the ore a substantial air-proof
covering and the jar of the mining oper-
ations might open up a crack in the rock
through which the air would escape for
this reason the miners were shut off by an
air lock through which they could escape
to safety in case of an accident

the air-making machine was so com-
pactly built that the dismantling of the
valve exposed quite a bit of the inner works
and we were able to see how it operated
on the surface of the moon there lay large
quantities of quartz the common dioxide of
silicon this was placed in a container in
the center of which was
a small piece of synth-
ium the tremendous
heat it generated proba-
bly aided by a catalyst
liberated the oxygen
which escaped upward
into a cooling tank the
residual silicon was sub-
jected to further heating
while a blast of helium
particles from the radio-
active synthium passed
through it and disinte-
grated each atom of sili-
con into two of nitrogen

the results of this op-
eration were to con-
vert silica into equal
parts of oxygen and
nitrogen the oxygen was far in excess of
the amount required to produce the propor-
tion of one part oxygen to four of nitrogen
existing in the air the remaining oxygen
however went to replenish the supply in
the atmosphere of the mine oxygen and ni-
trogen in normal proportions being mixed
and stored to compensate leakage impur-
ities in the air such as carbon dioxide and
smoke were removed by well-known pro-
cesses

the task of repairing the valve was near-
ing completion having occupied the time

wonder stories

we had spent in examining the machine
while the work of reassembling was going
on langley notified headquarters that we
would shortly be ready to return the
machine arrived by the time the job was
finished and was waiting for us

the return trip was made without incident
though each changing sound in the machin-
ery of the tractor sent shivers up my spine
and we arrived in due course at the main
colony the news of the loss of the tractor
had spread rapidly making a profound ef-
fect throughout the course of my second
meal in the dining hall it formed the main
topic of conversation and led to discussions
of its probable cause the men at our ta-
ble review the possibilities of mechanical
defects talked of margins of safety and of
overloading while from time to time a
stray phrase from another table voiced the
opinion that the machines were unreliable
or that the pilots recklessness was to blame
langley who knew more about it than any-
one present said nothing he was sched-
uled for a conference with dr forscher
after the meal and reserved his opinions

finally the gathering broke up into
groups and sauntered from the dining hall
wiley and i found our way to our quar-
ters and were grateful for the relaxation of
comfortable chairs and strong tobacco we
remained silent for the most part for
though there was much to talk over it was
tacitly understood that rest was al present
more important wiley had had no sleep
since we reached the establishment of dr
forscher and i was still weakened tom the
offects of my long spell of unconsciousness
our smoke finished we bade one another
good-night-wiley remarking that two
weeks of darkness would suit him well-
and in ten minutes i was oblivious of moon
earth and the entire cosmos

my watch showed that eight hours had
passed when the telephone rang sharply
wiley had heard it sooner and was at the
instrument when i reached the living-room
i could make nothing of his conversation
but presently he turned to me with a grin

the boss is interested in us with a ven-
geancev he said im next on the con-
ference list and he wants me in a hurry

he bounded into his bedroom shouting at
me as he dressed and shaved i was astound-
ed at the speed with which he made himself
presentable but the cause of his excitement
remained a mystery for the time he pro-
mised me full details on his return and was
off in such a rush as i had not seen for days

as i bathed shaved and dressed i grad-
ually came fully awake my dazed wonder
at wileys tumultuous departure gave place
to an intense excitement i found diversion
for a time in wheedling some breakfast from
the chef a german to whom a breach of
routine was sacrilege supreme but return-
ing to the apartment a sense of anticipation
grew on me eagerly  awaited wileys
return pacing the floor smoking the air
blue wearing ray watch pocket threadbare
i tried to read there was nothing i had not
thumbed half-a-dozen times i contemplated
a trip of exploration only to dismiss it im-
mediately for fear of missing wiley min-
utes dragged twelve oclock became half-
past then one two three

wiley burst into the room and hit me
such a thump on the back that i was unable
to more than gasp while he exclaimed
breathlessly

youre next old man dont let him
bluff you tell him you know your stuff
well have the world by the tail and he
gave me a push that sent me flying into the
corridor shouting a room number after
me he slammed the door

more bewildered than ever i set out
in search of the room it proved to
 be the office of dr forscher and i was
immediately ushered into his presence by a
silent secretary

 had formed little conception of what
the man might he like other than that he
must possess such an intelligence as i had
never before encountered but i was not
disappointed from behind a low desk a
pair of eyes regarded me fixedly-eyes that
seemed to look through me to search out
my very thoughts they were sheltered by
shaggy brows yet seemed to protrude from
beneath a massive forehead which might
have contained all the knowledge of the
the outpost on the moon



ages a fringe of grayish hair close crop-
ped surrounded the dome of his head
large well-formed ears indicated an acute
sense of hearing his nose was long thin
and rather out of keeping with the rest of
his features a wide mouth thin lips com-
pressed into a line indicating determination
rather than hardness surmounted a jaw like
that of the heidelberg giant he spoke in
a resonant bass which rose from the barrel-
like chest of his short squatbody

george mar land he asked i had
not had the pleasure of your acquaintance
before however your colleague wiley
has told me about you  regre the slight
inconvenience to which you were subjected
a short while ago- referring to the elec-
tric spark which had nearly ended my
career we had no knowledge of your in-
tentions and thought it best to have the
first word i trust you will pardon it

i had intended to allow you to become
more acquainted with our establishment be-
fore having this talk with you recent de-
velopments make it imperative however
that wc come to an understanding

no doubt you wonder as did mr wil-
ey why we are here a fair question why
should a group of scientists voluntarily
give up the comforts of earth for such a
confined existence as we lead it will
take a bit of explaining let me say how-
ever that my assistants followed me here
of their own volition i only provided the
opportunity they and i are here solely
to benefit mankind

the driving ambition of my life has
been the advancement of human welfare

i came early to the conclusion that this
was to be realized only through know-
ledge or as some pul it science hence
i studied science in all its branches i
specialized in none for with the burning
ambition of youth i hoped some day lo
know all there was to know i mastered
the practice of medicine and its right-hand
assistant chemistry i studied the laws
and phenomena of physics mathematics
and astronomy i delved into psychology
biology philosophy and more

it was while a student al berlin that the
first event occurred which led me to my

present silualion looking through my op-
en window i saw a meteor fall from the
sky not such a meteor as we frequently
notice on clear fall evenings but a most
unusual meteor while still high in the
air it burst into brilliant blue flame and
scattered into a thousand pieces which hurt-
led downward finally disappearing close
to the ground shortly after the breeze
brought to my nostrils a faint odor almost
indistinguishable yet unmistakable-the
odor of burning sulphur

i was so struck with the peculiar behav-
ior of this meteor that i called it to the at-
tention of dr steinle professor of astrono-
my al berlin he agreed with me that the
phenomenon was unprecedented and con-
cluded to ask for reports on it from other
observers

the results of his inquiries brought
forth a singular coincidence no more da-
ta were forthcoming about our meteor but
twenty-nine days before a meteor behaving
exactly like it had been observed at san
francisco the two were identical except
that the odor of sulphur dioxide had not
been noticed its color however was that
of rapidly burning sulphur furthermore
it had come from the same section of the
sky-in ihe plane of ihe ecliptic on the
side away from the sun we now broad-
cast the description of these two meteors
asking for further information regarding
them or others like them and set about
searching the sky in that neighborhood for
some strange body

our search brought out another peculiar
fact the meteors had been seen for many
miles around the points where they landed
they must have burst into flame almost im-
mediately on entering the upper atmos-
phere yet to our knowledge there was
not enough oxygen at that altitude to sup-
port combustion they must have con-
tained large quantities of it within them-
selves to produce such a brilliant flame
and indeed their fierce light suggested com-
bustion in pure oxygen

however we were unable to locate any
possible source of the peculiar bodies on
the nights in question the moon the stars
of the constellations libra scorpio and


wonder stories

sagittarius and three of the planets -
mars jupiter and neptune-occupied that
part of the heavens but no comets or other
strange bodies could be found

a strange bombardment

n the fourteenth day after our search

v- began newspapers from the united
states reported that a meteor similar to the
first two had fallen over north dakota
probably in the neighborhood of devils
lake we could find nothing definite
about the direction from which it had come
but twenty-eight days later we received a
cablegram from ail amateur astronomer in
cairo named zirkle reporting a fourth in
whose light he had detected the spectrum
lines of sulphur

the absence of any comet or other source
of this meteoric shower together with their
remarkable composition began to suggest
to me some design behind their appearance
there was a certain regularity about their
arrival the two longer intervals were ex-
actly double the fourteen-day period if
the change of date at the international line
were taken into account and it was easy
to imagine that others might have fallen
unnoticed to make this period exact but
they were obviously not of earthly origin-
they were too widely distributed were
they then the work of intelligent beings
somewhere out in space

reasoning from that basis  set out to
discover if possible what sort of beings
they were where they might be and their
intentions in bombarding the earth con-
sidering the last item i agreed thus the
meteors were harmless they had in no in-
stance reached the surface of the earth and
while sulphur dioxide in sufficient quanti-
ties is poisonous the relatively small
amount which they liberated had no effect
whatsoever the brilliant light however
was bound to attract attention and i be-
lieved that this was the sole aim of the
meteors but why attempt to attract the at-
tention of us earth-creatures unless to lead
us to their source and who other than
beings possessing an intelligence compara-
ble to our own would wish to draw atten-
tion to themselves

make no mistake i did not assume they
were men our physical form is merely
the product of our environment and with-
out surroundings paralfeling ours in great
detail it is extremely unlikely that the
process of evolution would have produced
an animal even generally resembling our-
selves on another planet however they
must have some things in common with us-
to begin with they were not greatly in-
ferior to us mentally nor could they be
much further advanced than ourselves else
they must look on us as lower animals un-
worthy of attention

furthermore their science of chemistry
physics astronomy and psychology must
be akin lo ours as was proved by their
knowledge or suspicion at least that in-
telligent life exists on our planet their
ability to direct a meteor as we fire a gun-
shot to a small target across empty space
their knowledge of the common meteorite
and ability to produce one so totally unlike
it as to attract attention and finally the
expectation that this attention would pro-
gress from the meteors to themselves
furthermore they must possess the ability
to perceive light-vibrations-not necessar-
ily have eyes but distinguish the same rays
or a part of the same rays as we and to
distinguish one color from another there
was then considerable ground in common
on which we might build a basis for com-
munication

but to communicate with them we must
know their location unfortunately we did
not know the exact direction from which the
meteors had come nor would we have been
much better off if we had for the attraction
of the sun and other members of the solar
system might have caused them to deviate
considerably from their original course
but by noting the portion of the sky from
which they appeared we had computed their
original direction approximately their
being in the plane of the ecliptic suggested
the probability that they came from some
body in the solar system and this at once
narrowed the possibilities to mars jupiter
neptune their satellites and the asteroids

having gotten this far i needed more
data nothing more could be discovered
the outpost on the moon



from the meteors already fallen closer ob-
servation of hater ones was necessary

the next meteor somewhat upset ray cal-
culations however arriving on the north-
western shore of north america three weeks
later where it was seen from both prince
rupert british columbia and juneau al-
aska the fourtecn-day period was now
destroyed but  saw almost immediately
that the intervals were all multiples of sev-
en days it might be that my unknown
creatures had a knowledge of our calendar
and were timing their shots lo come once
a week but it seemed far more likely that
they were fired at a regularly recurring
time when the greatest accuracy was pos-
sible that is when some point on their
planet was in line with the earth work-
ing on this assumption i plotted the points
of arrival on a terrestrial globe and found
confirmation of my theory each location
pointed to the same spot in the sky each
was two three or four times fifty-six de-
grees of longitude west of the preceding one
and furthermore supposing that one had
fallen every seven days the intermediate
spots were so little frequented that the fall
must have gone unrecorded the interval
of longitude must correspond to a fraction
over seven days-a few minutes less than
four hours in fact-in which the unknown
globe completed its orbit

i projected my path of arrival into the
future and predicted lhe arrival of the
next four the first two in liberia and
asia minor would probably be missed but
the third should be visible from paris it
came three weeks later bursting almost over
the city and causing no little excitement i
made bold to announce publicly that the
fourth could be seen from newfoundland
and when the consul at st johns reported
its arrival at two a m  considered my
theory established i had only to name a
body in the solar system near the point
from which the meteors had come which
completed its orbit in a fraction over seven
days and the abode of the beings was
found

i published my analysis of the data but
the scientific world was loalh to place cre-
dence in the work of an undergraduate

student they pointed out that i had over-
looked the simple fact that life as we know
it could not exist where i said it did shrug-
ged their shoulders and forgot me to
add to my discomfiture the fall of the met-
eors abruptly ceased and my intelligent
creatures assumed a place alongside the
fabled engineers of mars as the creation
of a mind which saw only what it wanted
to see

chapter vii
a gigantic plan

t was amazed at the hail of criticism

x which fell upon me i became a nine
days wonder through the efforts of the
newspapers i was beseiged by reporters
photographers and the like seeking inter-
views the better to deride me publicly in
short my life became a veritable hell and
i was forced to abandon my studies and
seek refuge for a time in solitude

my faith in my conclusions was un-
shaken but one such experience was
enough i resolved never again to mention
my planet and its inhabitants until i could
lay before the world unquestionable proofs
henceforth i devoted my life to obtaining
evidence with which to convince mankind
that i was right but how to obtain these
proofs i must demonstrate that life was
possible on my planet and it seemed as
though i could never do so

as you know there are several condi-
tions which are indispensible to any form
of life we know foremost among these
is an atmosphere containing a large portion
of free oxygen this is equally indispen-
sible to life in the sea for it is the pressure
of the air which prevents the water from
evaporating entirely and the fish receive
their oxygen from that which is dissolved
in water it is equally important that the
climate must be moderate that is the tem-
perature must not be so high as to injure
the delicate chemical compounds of living
bodies nor yet low enough le prevent their
functioning likewise there must be an
abundance of water without which the pro-
cesses of life cannot go on these condi-


wonder stories

lions are not sufficient by themselves but
if they are met in all probability the situa-
tion will be favorable to the growth and
development of some form of life

whether or not they do exist on that
planet is a question for the telescope and
the spectroscope if they are there their
presence will be betrayed in the spectra of
water-vapor oxygen and carbon-dioxide in
its atmosphere

but accurate spectroscopic measure-
meants with the instruments then available
on earth were impossible the entire plan-
et could be seen in the largest of telescopes
only as a minute globe the size of a pea
i wanted to see it a hundred times larger
but this would require a telescope with a
magnifying power of  to  dia-
meters

manifestly this was impossible even
though such a tremendous instrument could
be built it would be worthless with the
telescope then in use the motion of the air
was sufficiently magnified so that the heav-
ens were seen as through a stream of water
a foot or more deep the practical limit was
fast being approached unless i could
find a way to get rid of the disturbing air-
currents there was little use in building a
telescope any larger than that which has no
doubt been completed for the kingsley ob-
servatory in the united states and even
its -inch mirror would be hopelessly
inadequately for my purpose

a solution fantastic yet intrigu ig sug-
gested itself and indeed you must now
guess our object in being here-in estab-
lishing this outpost on the moon-is to
build a telescope where there is no air
where objects weigh only one-sixth as much
as on earth where the rotation is much
slower where celestial objects are visible
whether the sun shines or not where con-
ditions ideal for astronomical observation
prevail hour after hour year after year
with no interruption from clouds winds or
what you will

anything seems easier in retrospect than
before it is accomplished i will not bore
you with the details of my coming let it
suffice that i spent forty years seeking the

means of getting here that i found it at
last in my new element synthium

but to return to the telescope i men-
tioned that i would require a magnification
one hundred times greater than that of any
telescope used on earth it is a well-known
fact that the most efficient eye-piece for
looking at extended surfaces has an enlarge-
ment of about twenty-five times for each
inch of aperture though greater powers
are sometimes used sir benjamin wright
had at the time of which i speak built a
reflecting telescope one hundred inches
across hence his best eyepieces possessed
powers of enlargement more than 
times to give the magnification i wished
my instrument must then have an aperture
of four hundred feet however there are
factors which reduce this figure materially
to begin with the earths atmosphere ab-
sorbs six-tenths of the light from the stars
here on the moon we get it all then too
photographic plates may be used to accu-
mulate light from faint objects by long
exposure in short a telescope one hun-
dred feet across would give the results i de-
sired if used on the moon

i recruited my little band of scientists
and my force of laborers built the tractors
and came here eleven years ago eleven
years is not too much time for the construc-
tion of so great an instrument it is just
nearing completion and will be ready for
the great test in a few months and it will
stand thereafter a monument to science a
source of invaluable information long after
i have seen my theory proven my only
regret is that i cannot live as long as it
lives and see with my own eyes the secrets
of the heavens unfolded

however i am an old man though still
vigorous i am past seventy and can hope
for but a few more years of active life
yet the work i have begun must go on
the greatest benefactors of humanity are
those men who have given lo succeeding
generations better tools with which to add
to their store of knowledge and so it is
lhat i now seek a successor to begin where
i must leave off
the outpost on the moon



rphis successor must be an exceptional
i person he must be a trained scien-
tist of the highest order must be possessed
of a brilliant mentality great courage and
the ability to endure hardships and above
all he must have the patience the endur-
ance to devote his life to his work as i
have done

i say without egotism but as a statement
of fact that i know of no one man who
possesses all these requirements there
are many who have a few some who poss-
ess most of them but none who can lake
over all of the responsibilities which must
be assumed therefore  have decided to
pass on the management of this colony to a
group of men who taken together have all
these qualities

your colleague wiley is a remarkable
man  hold him in the utmost respect
his attainments in the field of physics sur-
pass my own in some respects he is
young vigorous brave to the point of reck-
lessness a man suited in many ways to un-
dertake the task of carrying on my work
but unfortunately he is not an astronomer
and after all it is in that field that the great-
est good will come from this outpost of
science nevertheless as a lieutenant to an
able astronomer wiley will be invaluable

	have suggested it to him and he is most
enthusiastic

with him will be dr langley a hard-
headed practical engineer who will be a
useful counterbalance to wileys impetuo-
sity these two and a third will be the
leaders of this colony when i retire

the third man will be an astronomer
he is not here he knows nothing of this
enterprise in fact i do not know yet who
he will be  have considered the men on
earth whose ability i know and have se-
lected from them three possibilities all
were men of promise when i knew them
any of them is capable of doing the astrono-
mical work but i know little of them per-
sonally before i select one of them i must
know whether he possesses the qualities i
have mentioned and whether he is in a posi-
tion to abandon the earlh for such a life
as we lead here

i cannot go personally to interview these

men i shall send someone who can take
months if necessary to become personally
acquainted with them and sound them out
before making any proposition it will re-
quire diplomacy patience and resourceful-
ness moreover it will require an up-to-
date knowledge of the events of the world

i should also like to maintain more or
less regular contact with ihe earth hereafter
for various reasons i need more laborers
there are doubtless scientific developments
which should prove useful to me and from
time to time  shall want materials which
are not readily procurable here

 have taken an hour of your time and
mine to lay before you in some detail our
situation so that you may be prepared to
answer the question i wish to ask you it
is ihis are you willing to be my inter-
mediary between the moon and the earth

i	had come for this interview expecting
almost anything yet i was utterly dum-
founded at the doctors last words i con-
trolled an impulse to question my ability
for  paid him the compliment of knowing
men and i felt sure that he would never
have offered me the post without first mak-
ing sure of my qualifications therefore i
collected my thoughts and considered for a
moment i had no reason ever to return
permanently to the earlh and if wiley was
to remain here and eventually come inlo a
controlling position there was every incen-
tive for me to remain and see the thing
through

the doctor was sitting patiently awaiting
my reply his face was expressionless yet
those piercing eyes of his seemed to pene-
trate inlo my mind and expose ihe thoughts
there he smiled slightly even before i
spoke as though he had already read the
words which came

i shall be very glad to accept

ii	was some forty-eight hours later than
wiley and i had our first glimpse of the
nearly-completed telescope it was truly
a monstrous thing build on the reflecting
principle since it is easier to make large
mirrors of perfect figure than lenses of like
dimensions il measured one hundred feet
across and fully six hundred to the top of
the tube which was a criss-cross frame-


wonder

stories

work of steel girders built to support the
smaller mirror which deflected the beam
of light toward its focus on the side of the
instrument on this tube was also a small
platform on which the photographic appara-
tus was mounted and which could be used
for direct observation if desirable

the instrument was housed in a dome
similar to that of the ordinary terrestrial
observatory save that it was insulated
against heat and equipped with an appara-
tus to maintain the temperature within a
small range this eliminated all deforma-
tion and possible cracking of the mirror due
to heat and cold the observatory was lo-
cated exactly at the lunar equator so that
every star in the firmament was visible at
some time or other the twenty-eight day
period of the moon made possible much
longer single periods of observation of one
body than on earth where the duration of
the night and changing conditions of weath-
er often made it nccessary in photographing
faint objects to expose the same plate on
several nights

as i stood at the base of this greatest
of scientific instruments i sensed some of
the gratification that the man who had made
it possible must feel i no longer wonder-
ed that he could shut himself away for so
long a time for i was becoming imbued
with the enthusiasm that all these men here
must feel knowing that some day soon this
great inquisitive eye would be turned on
the heavens to search out its greatest secret
-the whereabouts of other equally intelli-
gent and curious creatures although real-
izing full well that it was a matter of months
to the completion of the telescope and af-
ter that many more months of careful re-
search work before the theories of dr for-
scher could be proven or discredited nev-
ertheless as i stood near the axis of the
cradle which held that hundred foot mirror
a feeling of restlessness of expectation came
over me i could not help but feel that
we were on the verge of some great event
that the story which the telescope was soon
to tell would be not only the answer to a
question for which a great man had spent
his life but the beginning of a new era in
science and the history of mankind

on earth again

my opportunities to watch the progress
of the construction were few however

i	set to work at once to master the running
of the synthium tractors for days i rode
in the pilot house silently watching the
man at the helm as he sent the machine
hurtling above the ground at terrific speeds
later i guided its course with my own hands
under his watchful eye i circumnavigated
the whole moon in less than a day seeing
the rocky plains and jagged peaks of the
hemisphere which had been forever hidden
from my earthbound fellows taking short
jaunts directly away from the ground into
the weird mottled sky

at length my instructor pronounced me
competent to start out for the earth in search
of an astronomer to collaborate with dr
forscher and complete the controlling tri-
umvirate which was to succeed him time
had passed quickly in our little underground
world  could hardly believe that six
weeks had passed since my arrival but
the hour was at hand when  must return to
my native planet dr forscher wiley and
a few others were on hand to see me off
and after a brief exchange of farewells i
climbed aboard with a small crew of en-
gineers and a relief pilot

the journey took only about two days
and there was little novelty in it once
free of the moons attraction we cut down
the force of the discharging gas so that
we gained speed at the rate of only one-
sixth of a foot per second each second yet
at the end of twenty-four hours we were
shooting through space at the terrific pace
of over  feet per second-better than
a hundred and fifty miles a minute the
telescope in the pilot house occasionally
picked up a tiny dot of light that revealed
itself as a chunk of meteoric rock and only
a quick shift of the gyroscopes saved our
rocketing tractor from being split from top
to bottom

we turned its base toward the earth and
began to slow down we must travel blind
now yet we were safe the fierce blast of
gas from the driving synthium blew ob-
structions from our path like chips in a
the outpost on the moon



hurricane leaving us nothing to do but
make plans for our sojourn on the earth

at length we sighted the rim of its night-
shrouded face stretching away beneath us
our speed was reduced to a hundred miles
an hour-a snaila pace to us-and we drop-
ped into the rare layer of hydrogen which
marks the upper limit of the atmosphere
below us was the gentle sheen of the at-
lantic glimmering in the pale light of the
moon- a moon which had inspired volumes
of poetry distance indeed lent enchant-
ment to its jagged blazing face

our immediate destination was the city
college accordingly  turned the tractor
westward and at a now constant velocity
we sped across the ocean day was break-
ing when we dropped gently to earth on the
outskirts of the great city  had left less
than two months before

two months was it possible that in
so short a space of time my life could have
changed so radically so strangely it
seemed ages since i had said goodbye to a
little group of scholars near the spot where
we now rested and how much more
strongly must these sentiments have affected
the others of the party who had not trod
the earth seen trees and grass nor watched
the coming of the day in a dozen years

we burst forth reeling and stumbling
like drunken men so unused were we to the
strong pull of gravity the tractor lay off
the traveled highways so we fastened its
outer door with little fear lhat it would be
molested i led the way to a trolley line
half a mile distant thanking wileys fore-
sight in taking along a fair sum of ameri-
can money for our return dr forscher
had provided a quantity of gold bullion to
defray my expenses but i could imagine
the astonishment of a trolley-car conductor
on being offered a ten kilogram bar as fare

we left the trolley at a down-town ho-
tel where i engaged rooms for the others
then after a hasty breakfast we set out
in search of presentable clothes for those
we had worn on the moon were designed for
service alone my credit was still good
and we presently sauntered forth in unim-
peachable garments

i promised to arrange for living expen-

ses for the crew for a couple of months
and bade them goodbye for the present af-
ter exacting solemn promises to keep in
touch with me and to be on hand for the
return trip they set off ere masse in search
of excitement and  headed for the city
college alone

dr willson had not yet arrived when
i reached the physics building his sec-
retary ushered me into his private office
where i made myself at home  had not
been waiting long when he entered stopping
in his tracks as if facing a ghost

marland he exclaimed we had
given you up for dead when did you gel
back wheres wiley his questions
rushed in a torrent

 answered the last

up there i said indicating vaguely
on the moon he demanded he

isnt-

no i returned alive and well and
among friends

e apparently thought me demented and
i added its a long story but ill tell
you about it

i recounted briefly the facts of our being
picked up by the lunar colony of the re-
markable works of science which had been
done there and of dr forschers purpose
when i reached this point dr willson in-
terrupted

what planet is this that he believes sup-
ports life he asked

lie didnt name it i said but  can
hazard a guess he described it as being
al a great distance from the earth and hav-
ing a period of seven days and four hours
or a little less

that doesnt sound like a planet com-
mented dr willson more likely one of
the satellites-saturns or jupiters
ganymede i affirmed the third of
the satellites discovered by galileo its
period is seven days three hours and forty-
odd minutes about  miles in dia-
meter-quite a fair-sized world

but life there isnt possible he pro-
tested the sun gives it only l-th as
much heat as the earth receives measure-
means have been made to show that the sur-


wonder stories

face temperature is  degrees below

zero

dr forscher does not contest that i
replied he merely states that the evi-
dence of the meteors is conclusive how-
ever the question will be settled soon
and i went on to explain my present mis-
sion

and youre to find the astronomer eh
commented dr willson did he specify
anyone

he named three for me to choose be-
tween i replied though i havent any
idea where to find them now that was
one object in coming here-i thought per-
haps you might help me

ill be glad to he agreed who are
jthey ill get in touch with the astronomy
department-theyd be most apt to know

the names of the men were in a letter
among the other documents i had brought
with me after a moments search i found
them

bradley rondeau and quaile i said
bradley took his degree at chicago and
was with the lick observatory for awhile
rondeau was at paris and quaile at green-
wich i believe but that was twelve years
ago theres no telling where they are now
of course

no he agreed but ill see if radner
knows anything of them

he turned to his phone and was con-
nected with the astronomy department
after a few minutes conversation he re-
ported 

bradley is in africa getting ready for
the next solar eclipse hes in charge of
an expedition somewhere in the jungle
and it would take months to reach him
rondeau died in -pneumonia they
say he would have been a great man too
its a pity thornton quaile is in this
country at flagstaff in fact doing re-
search on the planets he paused sudden-
ly by the way did you know-or of
course you dont-that he has published a
book recently on the conditions of the plan-
ets hes become quite an authority on the
solar system hed be a good man to look
up id say

centigrade scale- fahrenheit

id like to read the book i declared
have you a copy of it at the college
at the library

ill go there immediately  said much
obliged for your assistance

be sure and keep in touch with me until
you go he said

of course

at the library i obtained a copy of
thornton quailes treatise life on other
planets and settled down to peruse it
the author tried to point out the folly of
definite assertions about the matter re-
ferring to mars he observed that the pop-
ular theory of its canals must stand or
fall on the question of whether its atmos-
phere contained water and oxygen for
without water vapor in the air there could
evidently be none on the ground and with-
out oxygen no life could exist then he
presented contrasting results obtained by
different observers who had tried to settle
that question without success

the very fact that we can live on the
earth interferes with our attempts to find
out about other worlds said the book
in taking pictures of the spectrum of mars
in which the dark lines of oxygen and water
appear we are also photographing the air
above us which contains these same lines
we can only guess how much of the spec-
trum on our plates belongs to mars and
how much to the earth the water band
particularly is subject to wide changes in
a few hours whena shift in the wind brings
quantities of moisture to the air above us
thus in the same night photographs may
give results which differ by two or three
hundred percent

in a later chapter i found venus too
guards her secrets as closely as the queen
of beauty for whom she is named two
capable astronomers may point their teles-
copes at her clouded face one announces
that the length of her day is twenty-three
hours the other says six weeks

in the face of such conflicting data the
book summed up who are we to say there
is or there is not life elsewhere in the solar
system if you were to ask nje how shall
we find out i should reply let us take
our telescopes somewhere where there is no
the outpost on the moon



air to annoy us or better still let us go and
see for ourselves

 closed the book and sat wrapped in
pleasant thought unless i was greatly mis-
taken thornton quailes wish would soon
be fulfilled

chapter viii

quaile

i left the city college about noon and
hiring an auto drove alone to the rest-
ing-place of the tractor the last mile or
so was over a bumpy cart-track almost
unused and it was not easy to drive the
car to the tractors base i set about remov-
ing my few belongings to the auto together
with the gold which was to defray my ex-
penses this last was a job which taxed my
strength to the limit but finally it was
done and i returned to the city here  de-
posited the gold at a bank purchased a
suitcase and some more clothes and bought
a railroad ticket to flagstaff arizona

the journey was long and monotonous
i bought a periodical from the news butcher
and read until the jiggling print made my
eyes smart after a dinner of under-done
beefsteak in the diner i wandered back
to the observation platform and watched
the rails chase each other into the distance
as darkness fell  grew drowsy and pres-
ently fell asleep

 imagined i was hoating through space
above a tiny world no larger than a pea
it grew in size to a globe just big enough
to stand on and i set one foot gingerly on
its surface then i became aware of an-
other man standing before me he was try-
ing to communicate with me as i could see
from his gestures but i could make nothing
of them at length angered at my stupidity
he picked up an enormous ball of glowing
sulphur and hurled it in my face where it
burst with a terrific roar i awoke to find
a switch engine coupled to the rear of the
train its headlight illuminating the plat-
form

the other chairs were deserted except for
the one next to mine where there sat one
of those talkative travelers who are always

ready to start a conversation given the
slightest opportunity he was somewhat
amused at my startled awakening

where you going friend he roared
above the exhaust of the locomotive

ganymede i roared back

never heard of it he shouted little
place

bigger than north america i an-
swered he looked at me puzzled then
apparently thinking i was trying to make
a fool of him he arose in a huff and went
inside  followed after a few minutes and
finding my berlh made up i went to bed

during the next day i speculated as to
how i should approach quaile in order to
gain his confidence without disclosing my
object at length i decided to represent
myself as an amateur astronomer and lead
him into conversation about life on the
planets

after a change of trains i arrived at flag-
staff on the third day and set out at once
to locate quaile the observatory was some
distance from the town and it was well af-
ter dark when  arrived there the big tele-
scope was already pointed to the heavens
where mars was visible in the western
sky quaile was not in the observatory dome
however i found him with a fellow-scien-
tist puffing an enormous pipe and discus-
sing the respective merits of refracting and
reflecting telescopes his accent stamped
him at once as a britisher he was about
average height partly bald and wore a tiny
blonde moustache i judged he had recent-
ly turned forty he was a jolly lively per-
son and i felt at once that  liked him

ysee he was saying they cant make
these lenses big enough give me the re-
flectors-they get so much more light from
the planets now if i could just take that
big fellow at mount wilson up about fifty
miles where theres no air id show you
some jolly good photographs

	fell an impulse to tell him that his wish
would be more than granted il he went with
me to the moon but i must not be too
hasty  apologized for interrupting their
conversation and introduced myself the
other man excused himself saying he had
work to do quaile seemed surprised that


wonder stories

i should come all the way to arizona mere-
ly to talk with him and not a little pleased
that i considered him the foremost authority
on the planets i told him that i had a the-
ory regarding one of jupiters satellites and
would like to talk it over with him when he
had the time

v  time like the present he said

	promptly lets make ourselves
comfortable and you tell me about it he
settled back in his chair still puffiing his
huge pipe and listened with interest as i
explained that i believed ganymede might
be the abode of life i suggested that the
satellite might receive enough heat from
jupiter to make it habitable but i was
forced to omit dr forschers most convinc-
ing arguments and my reasons lacked force
instead of laughing at me however he
heard me through when i had finished he
explained the opinion of present day astron-
omers

ysee he said there have been a few
measurements of jupiters temperature
which indicate that its pretty cold there-
say a hundred and forty centigrade below
zero theres nothing in the way of plant
or animal life that could live al such a tem-
perature we dont know of any reason why
the satellites should be warmer so that just
about lets out the possibility of men being
there

however my insistence on the point
aroused a spark of interest in his mind and
he suggested that i stay around until the
present series of measurements on mars
were finished by that time jupiter would
be in a favorable position for observation
early in the mornings and he promised to
try to find out something about ganymede

i found accommodations in flagstaff and
spent much time in quailes company he
was passionately devoted to his work and
had no other interest except music he was
a capable performer on the violin and of-
ten whiled away his leisure hours enter-
taining small audiences with the dreamy
tones from his skillful bow  secretly re-
joiced to learn that he had no family ties
since this removed the greatest obstacle lo
his going to the moon i found him an

excellent fellow and enjoyed spending hours
with him at the observatory as he sat at
the eyepiece of the telescope motionless as
a statue following the path of the red
planet across the firmament we ex-
changed few words during such times yet
a considerable friendship grew up between
us i bided my time waiting for an oppor-
tunity lo broach the subject uppermost in
my mind

it came one night a month or so later
the spectroscopic work on mars was sus-
pended for the time being and we went one
night to the observatory to train the tele-
scope on jupiter and his satellites the
planet did not rise until two oclock in the
morning and was still low on the horizon
when we turned the dome to the eastward
and focussed the eyepiece in the field of
view we could see the disc of the great
planet streaked with belts about the middle
near one edge was a grayish blot the rem-
nant of the great red spot which caused
much comment among astronomers half a
century ago

scattered across the field like so many
stars save for their slightly greater size
were three dots of light one almost touch-
ing the planets edge the others farther
away on the opposite side these were eu-
ropa ganymede and callisto-the second
third and fourth of the satellites first seen
by galileo in the early seventeenth century
io the first was eclipsed by jupiters great
shadow

we brought ganymede to the center of
the field and applied a higher-powered eye-
piece it now appeared about the size of a
large buck-shot a tiny disc of light which
wavered slightly swelled and contracted
as the trembling atmosphere above us dis-
torted the beam of light that reached the
great lens we could see nothing of its
surface characteristics it was like looking
al the entire map of asia drawn on a pea

i imagined looking at it through dr for-
schers giant telescope making it appear a
hundred times larger what would we see
then-oceans and continents clouds or a
barren waste of ice

any laree telescope sliows ihe stars as small
discs due lo diffraction
the outpost on the moon



i resigned the eyepiece to quaile and he
peered through it intently for a moment
then he shook his head with a sigh

bad seeing he said the thing jumps
around like a cricket he climbed down
from the observers station on the step-lad-
der beneath the telescope yknow he
observed if we could find a way to get
rid of that motion wed be able to find out
a lot more than we can now its bad to-
night but its always there

quaile decides

i decided to spring my proposition
when i first saw you  began
you were saying that youd like to take
the mount wilson telescope up above the
atmosphere he smiled i drew a breath
and plunged ahead what would you say
if i told you where there was a bigger tele-
scope on solid ground with no air above it
at all

you mean someones put one on top of
mount everest he asked puzzled

better than that  replied theres
a telescope ready for use now waiting for
the man to handle it that would make a
dozen of the mount wilson reflector

yknow you interest me he said go
on

the mirror of this telescope is one hun-
dred feet in diameter i said it can be
used with eyepieces magnifying up to -

	diameters and theres absolutely no
atmosphere around it

where he demanded

on the moon i said

oh i say now he exploded its all
very well to joke but you carry it a bit
far

no joking about this i said and you
neednt have any fears as to my sanity i
can prove every word i say ive seen that
telescope with my own eyes and there are
men within our reach who will back up my
statements say the word and ill lake you
there in fact thats the reason im here

quaile was thunderstruck naturally
enough he pulled out his handkerchief
and wiped his forehead

well he said and again well

after a moment he asked but bow the devil
does one get to the moon

two men have done it independently
by different means i replied i can take
you there-if youre interested

interested well rather but yknow
its somewhat of a knock all this about a
telescope on the moon and men going
there how can one live there without any
air

there are several hundred men living
there now i said making their own air

this was the last straw for quaile i saw
that he regarded me as a raving maniac

yes of course old fellow he said pla-
catingly but lets not bother with it
what say to a cup of tea and we turn in

it suits me i agreed but do me a
favor perhaps youve heard of dr will-
son the physicist he nodded send
him a wire-ask him whether my story is
true

quaile seemed doubtful but i pressed
him and finally he agreed to do as  asked
i accompanied him lo the telegraph office
where he dispatched a wire to dr willson
asking for a prompt reply then he went
to bed for the day was breaking and the
astronomer like the owl seeks his home
during ihe daylight hours

when we awoke the following afternoon
dr willsons telegram was at the observa-
tory 

 marlands story regarding
telescope undoubtedly true
stop he has my complete con-
fidence-willson

quaile was impressed but i saw that he
still regarded the affair as a hoax nev-
ertheless i followed up my advantage

if  can show you a machine which will
take us to the moon will you go with me
i asked

seems like a fair proposition he as-
sented you wont mind of course if we
dont say anything about this to the men
here

not at all i assured him obviously
he did not want to be made a laughing-
stock in case this should turn out to be a
fools errand


wonder stories

we packed our baggage and took the
train east a few days later quaile
was a jolly traveling companion and de-
spite his not entirely unjust suspicion of
me the trip was enjoyable however as
we neared our destination a doubt assailed
me during the entire month of my sojourn
at flagstaff i had not heard a word from
the crew of the tractor what if they had
deserted me i could not very well manage
the machine alone for the return journey
and i could not find another crew with
this in mind i set out at once for the spot
where i had left the machine quaile going
with me

the tractor had been screened from the
roads by a grove of trees and it was with
mingled elation and fear that i led the way
to its resting-place however  was in no
way prepared for the sight which met my
eyes i recognized the trees the surround-
ing knolls the exact spot but there was
not a sign of the tractor

its gone i exclaimed rushing for-
ward there was no doubt that this was
the right place there was a patch of bare
ground where the discharge had burned
away the grass gone i repeated

yes observed quaile it seems to be
lake leave of one eh his face wore a
knowing smile he thought his suspicions
were confirmed and that i was crazy be-
yond a doubt

quaile i said fervently on my word
of honor that machine was here im
going to take you to dr willson and let
you hear from him the facts about this
whatever has become of the machine i am
going lo prove to you that i am neither a
liar nor a lunatic

in a fit of hopelessness i turned toward
the city but we had not gone ten paces when
i heard my name called i turned and saw
a man hurrying towards me over the near-
est hillock

mr marland he called we stopped
and he caught up with us out of breath
it was ihe relief pilot

i was afraid id miss you mr marland
he panted the machines in a field a
couple of miles from here some picnick-
ers found it and got curious and we had

to move it one of us had been on the look-
out for you all the time we thought you
never would come he added

i was loo relieved lo ask any questions
the pilot led the way over the hill lo
where a tent was pitched beside a battered
car the crew had established a camp here
and kept a lookout night and day for my
return we took down the tent bundled it
into the car and the three of us climbed in
the pilot drove up off into the country to
a bare unsettled spot there in the hol-
low between two knolls lay the traclor
the pilot blew the horn of the decrepit
auto and the rest of the crew lacking only
one man came tumbling out to greet us
my amazement knew no bounds with their
first opportunity to visit their homeland in
twelve years these men had elected to live
right in the tractor

chapter ix
a leak

the pilot acting as spokesman ex-
plained the situation

we all went off to look up our families
and friends he said they thought we
were dead and had made heroes of us
when we showed up hardly able to walk
on account of the gravity and not know-
ing anything about whats happened on
earth they didnt know what lo make of
it and when we said wed been on the
moon they thought we were crazy our
wives and sweethearts have all married
other men and our friends didnt know us
we tried to get work and couldnt hold a
decent mans job nobody wants us here
weve got friends on the moon we want
to go back

quaile was convinced there was no-
thing left but to load our baggage and start
for the moon i checked over the supplies
of food water and air in the machine and
made a list of the things we would need
then we went back to the city leaving the
crew to care for ihe tractor until our re-
turn on the morrow we visited dr will-
son purchased our supplies and picked up
our baggage loading it into the car which
the outpost on the moon



we had borrowed for the occasion we drove
out to the tractor the crew assisted in
loading and in short order we were ready
to start off

i climbed to the pilot house rang the
warning gong and sent ihe gas roaring
through the central well  paid no atten-
tion to the position of the moon preferring
to set the course after we were free of the
earth we climbed slowly at first not wish-
ing to overload the machine which must
exert a tremendous force merely to over-
come the earths pull ll took us upwards of
an hour to reach a point sufficiently far
away to neglect its gravity then we turned
in a great circle toward the moon which
was visible over the edge of the globe to
the west toward the sun the tractor gained
speed rapidly and we were soon far away
from the earth in the midst of the airless
expanse of the solar system

quaile was immensely excited at the
strangeness of his surroundings he re-
mained for a long time at one of the win-
dows his eyes glued lo the glass giving
vent from time to time to exclamations of
amazement  could hardly restrain him
from turning the telescope in the pilot house
ori the planets and he was filled with im-
patience when i told him that it vpuld take
two days to reach the moon he explored
the tractor from end to end asking innum-
erable questions about its construction
source of power and the like when my
shift in ihe pilot-house was over he bom-
barded me with queries about the colony
on the moon which he had up lo now re-
garded as a figment of my imagination

i told him what i could of the way it had
been built the principles which made it
possible and the work done there but i
was hard put to satisfy his curiosity it
was with ihe greatest difficulty lhat i per-
suaded him to take some sleep and only
got him to do so by pointing out that the
time of our trip would seem shorter if he
did not remain awake so much

by the time we had reached the half-
way point and turned the iractor about
however he lost some of his impatience
he got out his violin and played to us for
an hour or more he was really an excel-

lent musician and had a remarkable reper-
toire his taste ran more to dreamy sooth-
ing melodies and those of lighter charac-
ter and between numbers he kept up a
running fire of talk recounting the history
of each of his selections and explaining his
interpretation of them he had an excellent
ear and possessed the sense of absolute
pitch to a high degree there was no doubt
that had he chosen lo do so he could have
become a famous artist

during the rendition of liebestraum
he suddenly put down his bow and began
liming the strings  had noticed nothing
wrong but he said with a grimace

the things deuced sharp must be that
the airs very dry here he picked up the
bow and continued playing but he had
gone only a few bars when he again
stopped

really he exclaimed its most as-
tounding i never heard an instrument get
off pitch so quickly the air has a re-
markable effect

suddenly a thought flashed into my
mind sounds are higher-pitched in
thin air

the pressure i shouted get into
your air-envelopes quick i dashed for
the suits hanging along the wall noting the
air-gauge as i pulled on the nearest the
pressure was only twelve pounds and as
 watched it fell lower  rushed up lo the
engine room to warn the men on duty
while others who had put on thair envel-
opes followed to relieve them then when
we were all protected we set out lo hunt
for ihe leak by closing the air light doors
between the compartments and noting the
air pressure in each we quickly located it
in the lowest section the glass windows
were all intact but after fifteen minutes
search we found a small break clean as a
bullet hole in the outside wall

let me stop a moment lo explain the
construction of the tractors walls of which
there were two the outer was built to
withstand the impact of meteorites too small
to be seen in the telescope it was not air
tight as soon as the machine left the at-
mosphere all the air between the outer and


wonder stories

inner walls escaped leaving a perfect vac-
uum which prevented loss of heat by con-
vection the inner wall was lighter of
air proof construction and was coated with
asbestos just before reversing the tractor
when we were at the peak of our velocity
we must have encountered a small object
of extreme hardness which had punctured
both inner and outer walls

we closed off this section of the interior
welded a plug into the hole and brought
the pressure up to normal from the reserve
tanks then out of curiosity we began a
search for the meteorite which had caused
the trouble quaile spied it in a corner
near the air lock he brought it to the
light where we examined it it was per-
haps half an inch in diameter with a rough
surface unde which a tiny glitter of fire
could be seen quaile rubbed il sharply
against the steel partition making a deep
scratch

a diamond he exclaimed a dia-
mond flying through space

there could be no doubt as to the cor-
rectness of his assertion the characteris-
tic hardness the fiery sparkle-it was the
rarest of meteoric stones which had struck
our tractor by the barest chance

quaile pocketed the stone as a souvenir
yknow he said i rather like this
space-flying what with picking up diamonds
and all but i hope we dont meet them
much bigger

a little over two days travel brought us
close to the moon we circled rapidly
around its surface to the spot on the equa-
tor where dr forschers outpost was locat-
ed quaile never ceased to enthuse over
the wild rugged landscape beneath us eye-
ing it with binoculars for many minutes
he seemed amazed that none of us had tak-
en the time to explore it mile by mile or
examine the character of the rocks and the
depths of the fissures this had been left
to the geologists of the colony and none of
us was acquainted with the results of their
work

the great telescope

when we sighted the protruding air-
locks of the entrance near the en-

closure where the tractors were stored his
excitement knew no bounds the chief of
transportation was on hand to greet us
and as we donned the radio-equipped air
envelopes his voice could be plainly heard
giving directions to the mechanics who were
to overhaul our tractor we descended the
elevator in the air-lock shaft and were met
by dr langley in the corridor inside i
introduced quaile and langley immediately
escorted him to the quarters which had been
prepared for him  departed for the apart-
ment which i shared with wiley and found
him there he jumped to his feet as  en-
tered his face beaming

welcome back old man he exclaimed
pumping my hand what news from terra
firma

i told him of my visit to dr willson and
recounted my adventures while in america
he listened eagerly interjecting questions
about his colleagues at the city college i
could tell him little of them having spent
so short a time there which i now regretted
when i had finished i asked

hows the telescope going

finished replied wiley finished
and tested man what a marvelous thing
theyve got a picture of a sun-spot that will
knock youifc eye out i never saw such
clearness you see when dr forscher
knew there was lo be an astronomer short-
ly he pushed the work to the limit and
they put it together in record time it was
tested out only a few days ago and the old
doctor was so tickled with it he nearly
smiled

this news set me all a-tingle i would
have set off at once for the observatory but
wiley counselled otherwise

its bed for you young fellow he said
youre dog-tired even if you dont know
it you look as if you hadnt slept for a
month

i agreed reluctantly and we turned in
but sleep was long in coming and filled
with scrambled dreams of tiny worlds sul-
phur meteors huge telescopes and diamonds
from the great void

after breakfast there was a conference
dr forscher wiley and quaile were pre-
sent and i was invited as a matter of cour-
the outpost on the moon



tesy as usual the doctor dominated the
conversation addressing himself first to
quaile he said

i have put forth every effort to produce
the most perfect telescope humanly possi-
ble as you have been informedno doubt
mr marland has told you as well my prin-
cipal motive in doing this i have person-
ally tested out the instrument making pho-
tographs of the sun and other bodies with
very gratifying results but i have deferred
the work for which it was designed until
your arrival in our laboratories here on
the moon we have worked out methods of
photography which we believe excel those
in use when i was actively engaged in as-
tronomical work some years ago how-
ever there may have been developments in
the technique on earth of which i know
nothing and for this reason i shall turn
over the major portion of the research to
you after giving you the benefit of our
developments

 am greatly honored said quaile sim-
ply of course i shall want to spend some
time getting acquainted with the instrument
so that i can interpret the results accurate-
ly-

that is wise you will have ample op-
portunity to do so returned the doctor
the body upon which this research is to
be conducted is the largest satellite of the
planet jupiter euphoniously named gany-
mede by its discoverer jupiter is not now
visible from the observatory it will rise in
something less than two hundred hours and
remain visible thereafter upwards of three
hundred i hope that in that space of time
enough work can be done to give some in-
dication of the condition of the satellite

ill do my best promised quaile

very well said the doctor ill leave
you to your own devices with the under-
standing that you may call on anyone here
for whatever assistance you may wish

the brief meeting broke up the three
of us leaving the doctor alone wiley
had experiments in progress at the physics
laboratory but i was a man of leisure for
the present and at quailes invitation i ac-
companied him to the observatory we had

had a brief glimpse of the telescope shortly
after his arrival but had not yet had an
opportunity to explore the observatory or
look into the eyepiece when we reached
the dome we found one of the men who had
been engaged in directing the construction
and assembling of the instrument he was
clad in an air envelope and before going
further he motioned us to dress ourselves
similarly then we proceeded through the
nearby air lock and entered the telescope
dome our conductor explained the opera-
tion of the instrument as we made a tour
of the room

it was obviously impossible to keep air
in the dome of the observatory but there
was a small booth mounted near the base of
the telescope which could be hermetically
sealed so that the observer need not wear
his envelope here he might look directly
at the image from the big mirror or guide
the photographic plate by means of an auxi-
liary eye-piece

the observatory was located exactly on
the moons equator this served two im-
portant purposes in mounting so enor-
mous a telescope it would have been diffi-
cult in the extreme to tilt its axis at an
angle yet the mounting must enable the in-
strument to follow the path of any star
across the heavens at the equator the stars
rose at right angles to the horizon followed
an arc of a circle across the sky and set
perpendicularly in addition every star in
the firmament except the earth for the ob-
servatory was on the side which nevec faces
it  was visible at one time or another the
two pole stars lay always on the rim of the
horizon while all the rest circled about
them showing themselves for half of each
twenty-eight earth day revolution

the polar axis of the telescope was con-
nected to an enormous driving clock timed
to follow the slowly creeping stars across
the heavens once set going it required
no further adjustment pursuing the tiny
lights as they wended their way in a body
from east to west during their two weeks of
visibility the observatory dome also ro-
tated keeping its broad slit always between
the great mirror and the stars on which it
was trained


wonder stories

quaile examined every detail of the ap-
paratus uttering exclamations of delight
and admiration we climbed to the obser-
vers booth and removing our helmets
looked into the eyepiece the telescope
was trained on the star cluster known as
the pleiades whose familiar seven sisters
were now mingled with countless thousands
of tiny points dotting the field like rain-
drops on a pavement

quaile decided to try out the telescope
himself at once he secured a number of
plates already prepared and returned to the
dome i watched him as he swung the huge
tube across the sky training it upon mars
he slipped a negative inlo the plate holder
made final adjustments of the direction and
focus of the instrument and climbed to the
observers station i watched as he follow-
ed the progress of the planet it was nec-
essary for him to watch it constantly shift-
ing the photographic plate by a hairs
breadth from time lo time the tremen-
dous magnification of the planets image
also magnified imperceptible irregularities
in the driving clock so that the variation of
a fraction of a millimeter would destroy sur-
face details in the picture in starting the
exposure quaile had centered his cross hairs
on some minute spot of the planets disc
and his trained eyes were best able to keep
it there

an illusion destroyed

at length he climbed down from the
booth and removed the plate

thai should do it he said now lets
see what weve got we hastened off to the
photographic laboratory where the plate
was carefully developed a group of as-
sistant astronomers and photographers sur-
rounded us as we bent over the negative
it bore little resemblance to a visual image
of the ruddy planet for in addition to its
colorless blackening bright spots were
marked by the deepest shadows leaving
blank patches in place of the darker areas
nevertheless i realized that it was by far
the best piece of work of its kind ever seen
the planet appeared  times larger than
the full moon as seen with the unaided eye

so that only a part of its disc was shown on
the plate with a little imagination i could
picture myself suspended a bare  miles
from its surface seeing it as it might some
day look to the venturesome pioneer who
first landed there i looked in vain for the
famous canals there were irregular
patches of dark color the more prominent
ones approximating straight lines but that
was all the supposed irrigation system
was an optical illusion which disappeared
on better examination

quaile went back to the observatory to
make more photographs lie was immense-
ly pleased with the success of his first ef-
fort and now had the opportunity he had
longed for to determine once for all what
was to be found in the martian atmosphere

during the next few days he told of his
achievements along this line and in doing
so he blasted one of the most fascinating
ideas which mankind has ever invented
namely the existence of a race of super-be-
ings who had engineered huge water chan-
nels to supply melting ice from the polar
caps he found that there was water true
enough but only as a vapor and in very
small amounts while the total absence of
carbon dioxide and oxygen showed conclu-
sively that any such highly developed or-
ganism as the human body could never en-
dure there without oxygen to breathe and
carbon dioxide to retain through the night
the meager heat of the sunlit hours all ani-
mal life must have long since succumbed to
the rigorous climate

the results of this investigation only
served to increase ihe impatience of the col-
ony did this unpromising news mean that
ganymede too was a desert world devoid
of living beings and that the earth alone
was capable of supporting an intelligent
race it was not encouraging to say the
least yet if this were true how to ex-
plain the sulphur meteors we must not
jump at conclusions the riddle would be
solved in a short time and all awaited eag-
erly the rising of jupiter and his attendant
moons

quaile and his assistants were in a bustle
of preparation while dr forscher himself
had taken charge of the construction of an
the outpost on the moon



extremely sensitive instrument to measure
the temperature of ganymedes surface it
was a refinement of apparatus used for sim-
ilar purposes by astronomers and was
based on the fact that when two wires of
different metals are joined to form a closed
circuit an electric current is produced by
warming one of the junctions the current
could be measured with a delicate galvano-
meter and the temperature of a distant body
thus computed

as the hour of jupiters rising drew near
an audience gathered in the observatory
with eyes strained to the east they waited-
scientist and laborer standing shoulder to
shoulder waiting for the consummation of
twelve years efforts their voices magni-
fied by the radio speaker of their envelopes
bespoke the emotions which filled them
there were not a few who held watches in
their hands and by one or another the pass-
ing of each minute was announced a
heavy voice from somewhere near me roared
a facetious admonition to the prince of the
solar system not to keep his audience wait-
ing and there was a ripple of laughter
then a shout broke through the tumult

there he is

an instant of awed admiration followed
as the yellow dot of the planets face
balanced on the horizon globing steadily
like a tiny diamond those on the outer
edge of the group crowded forward to get
a better view through the wide opening of
the dome the heavy-voiced joker called
for a cheer and it was given by the over-
enthusiastic then someone set up a shout
for quaile which wastaken up by the
group

wheres the astronomer why isnt he
on the job

i left the observatory and set off in search
of quaile he was dozing in his apart-
ment stretched out in an easy chair an
open book lay heedlessly on the floor beside
him his burned pipe had slipped from his
fingers cascading ashes on the carpet his
face wore an expression of peaceful oblivion

tills instrumenl the thermocouple is easily
capable of detecting the heat of a candle a
mile or more distant

to the question which had fired the imag-
ination of the entire colony

quaile  exclaimed jupiters ris-
en

he awoke with a starttake it easy
young fella no rush-ganymedes eclip-
sed right now hiding behind jupiter like
a bashful kid maybe it knows were look-
ing through the keyhole  was just catch-
ing forty winks before i get started ill
be in for a long pull

i apologised for my impetuousness he
waved it aside

pull up a chair and chat a minute i
complied

this things got you all on edge like
the rest of them he observed no doubt
they think ill have the answer in time for
dinner i wish  could but yunderstand
theres a sight of work to do im going to
make dozens of plates no one of them
would tell the story id be missing a bet
if  didnt get all  could on the whole sys-
tem-jupiter and all the other satellites
might turn up something from them that
would tell us quite a lot the doctor
doesnt want guesses he wants proof

i could not help admiring the mans
quiet common sense attitude why expect
results in a day after twelve years of pre-
paration and the doctor he wasnt up
there at the observatory yelling for action
no doubt like quaile he was calmly await-
ing the most propitious moment for his tem-
perature measurements

cant say as i blame these fellows for
getting excited said quaile i suppose
 must get along and start the show he
arose and stretched himself want to
come along and watch

thanks i said but i think ill do some
reading and turn in youll have audience
enough without me

i dare say he agreed i hate to disap-
point them but theyll probably see little
enough for awhile

we set off he to the observatory and i to
my apartment to kill time as best i could
as quaile had said there was no point in
anticipating results so soon dr forscher
had allowed the two weeks between the ris-
ing and setting of jupiter as a minimum

and there was no doubt that the two of them
would waste no time getting as much data
as possible leaving the examination of it
until the planet was no longer visible
forcing this thoughl into my mind  set-
tled down to await the passing of the inter-
vening time

what the telescope revealed

throughout the colony the air of
expectation and impatience continued
at mealtimes there was much speculation as
to the progress being made but no one con-
nected with the observatory was present
they worked almost continuously stopping
now and then to eat or lake a few hours
sleep at their posts the workmen who
did not understand the scientific aspect of
the task could not understand the neces-
sity of so much delay not a few of them
held the view that the inhabitants of gany-
mede could be seen directly through the
telescope that it was merely a matter of
looking at them to discover their appear-
ance habits and such having had some
practical experience with a telescope in my
college days  undertook to explain the
situation to a few who asked me about it
and presently i found myself conducting
an informal class in elementary astronomy
i was glad of the opportunity which pre-
sented itself to discuss the subject and lec-
tured in such glowing style that wiley who
happened in on one of the gatherings dubb-
ed me professor marland  forthwith

at length jupiter disappeared below the
horizon and excitement reached fever pitch
everyone was on edge waiting for word of
the results but quaile and dr forscher
had retired to their quarters for a well-earn-
ed sleep before doing anything further
and so forty-eight hours more passed and
nothing was learned

during the third day following jupiters
disappearance the word passed around that
dr forscher would meet those interested
in the experiments at his office after dinner
those interested turned out to be almost
the entire colony and the meeting adjourn-

ed to the dining hall where a platform of
tables was improvised and chairs gathered
around dr forscher took the platform
because of the size and heterogeneous char-
acter of his audience he elected to begin
his announcement with an explanation of
the experimental procedure the gathering
thus assumed the nature of a popular lec-
ture

as you are all aware he began we
have been testing a theory which i formu-
lated fifty years ago and which has been the
greatest interest of my entire life because
of the appearance of certain mysterious met-
eors i was led to believe that the satellite
ganymede might be the abode of intelli-
gent civilized life scientists at the time
were of the opinion that this was impossible
because of its great distance from the sun
ganymede revolves around the planet jupi-
ter once every seven days three and three-
quarters hours at a mean distance from that
planet of six hundred and sixty thousand
miles its distance from the sun there-
fore is about four hundred and eighty mil-
lion miles the earth is less than one fifth
that distance so that ganymede receives
only about one twenty-seventh as much
light and heat from the sun as does the
earth

this is obviously too slight an amount
to support any animal life we know for the
temperature must fall many degrees below
zero unless there are modifying factors

however the appearance of the sulphur
meteors seemed to indicate that there must
be modifying factors a few figures will
suffice to show that too much must not be
expected of even our great telescope jup-
iter is at present about four hundred and
fifty million miles from us the telescope
magnifies it one hundred thousand limes re-
ducing the apparent distance to forty-five
hundred miles in other words ganymede
appears to us about fifty-four times as
large as the full moon we have there-

the intensity of radiant energy such as sun-
light is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance from the -source jupiter is 
times os far from the sun as the earth hence
the proportion of light striking it as compared
with that reaching the earth is

fore been forced to adopt indirect methods
in seeking the information we desire

quaile aid i have been work-

jvj independently along different
lines and have had no opportunity to com-
pare notes until a few hours ago our re-
sults are curious but they are very satis-
factory

we find that the four major satellites of
jupiter constitute a series much like the
four inner planets of the solar system
they appear to show four stages of a pro-
gressive evolution from unendurable heat to
freezing cold some of ihe phenomeia of
these stages have already been noted by
terrestrial astronomers notably their den-
sity and their albedo or ability to reflect
light the amount of sunlight reflected
from any planet depends on the nature of
the surface we see thus venus the bright-
est of the planets is covered with clouds
which turn back nearly three fourths of the
suns rays while mars with his thin atmos-
phere and desert surface can return only
fifteen percent it has been well known
that jupiters satellites differed among
themselves in this respect

io closest to the primary reflects fully
half the light which strikes it indicating
that it must be covered by an envelope of
clouds as is venus europa is even
brighter the clouds are thinner and per-
haps broken in spots certainly they are less
dense over one part than elsewhere as the
satellite revolves about jupiter we note that
one part of its face always appears dim-
mer than the rest callisto the outermost
of the four behaves similarly its surface
being the least bright of all

it has also been previously noted that
the density of the satellites grows progres-
sively less from io to callisto the latter
would almost float in water while the for-
mer is much like our moon in size and
weight a cubic foot of its soil on the
average would weigh about three-fifths as
much as the same amount taken from the
earth ganymede in this respect is inter-
mediate between callisto and europa

cf for example pages - russell dugan
 stewart astronomy vol i ginn  co

these facts are not new but let us
now consider the work we have just com-
pleted the best measurements of temper-
ature heretofore have shown that jupiter
never rises much above  degrees centi-
grade below zero at the surface and it
has been supposed that the satellites are
similarly cold however my figures indi-
cate a different situation the value for
jupiter is substantially correct but the satel-
lites are much warmer why this should
be true i am not prepared to say at present
but nevertheless it is so io revolving close
to jupiter is around  degrees above zero
-twice as hot as boiling water europa
shows a temperature of  degrees which is
just below the boiling point on earth it
is worth remarking however that water
boils at different temperatures depending
on the atmospheric pressure by placing a
dish of water in a vacuum il is perfectly
possible to have it boiling and freezing at
the same time we cannot be sure there-
fore that there is liquid water on europa
but with ganymede such is very probably
the case the temperature is a few degrees
above the freezing point part of the time
at least there must be open water on its sur-
face and from the cloudiness of its atmos-
phere i venture to predict that streams
lakes and oceans may he found callisto
is a frozen world little warmer than jupi-
ter itself it would seem thal the satellites
must receive some sort of energy from that
planet since ihe reduction of temperature
corresponds to their increasing distance
from it

turning now to the photographs for
which we have labored to build our magni-
ficent telescope the evidence of a progres-
sive series continues mr quaile has made
excellent photographs of the light of these
satellites with the spectroscope the greatest
aid to astronomy since the invention of the
telescope there is a parody on a familiar
jingle which runs

twinkle twinkle little star

now weve found oul what you are

when unto the midnight sky

we the spectroscope apply

mr quailes photographs show that the
four satellites we are studying have quite


wonder stories

different atmospheres io is the hottest we
have found hence we might reasonably ex-
pect active volcanoes covering its surface
which should have cooled only enough to
be thinly crusted over with solid matter
observations of the vapors from erupting
craters have shown us what to expect in the
air of such a world and our spectroscope
bears out the prediction there is no oxy-
gen whatsoever but in its stead quantities
of carbon dioxide and choking poisonous
gases such as chlorine and carbon mono-
xide  hardly need point out that life in
such an atmosphere would be impossible
chlorine helped to make the world war the
horror it was and the frequent deaths from
minute quantities of carbon monoxide in
automobile exhausts indicate the unfriend-
liness of the latter to living creatures

life discovered

tt llropa is not much better off the

-j atmosphere is denser and better able
to support clouds of water vapor volcan-
ic gases predominate though not to such an
extent as on the sister satellite as there is
enough oxygen to reduce some of them to
harmlessness

on ganymede the volcanic activity is
unimportant if not entirely absent sun-
light heat and growing plants have split up
the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxy-
gen as on the earth nitrogen forms the
rest of the atmosphere this world has
passed the destructive youth of its two
smaller sisters and has blossomed in moth-
erhood

callisto is the spinster of the quartet
she has passed into sterility without ever
being capable of supporting life her froz-
en face is thinly covered with a layer of
nitrogen from which carbon dioxide water
and oxygen have departed to unite with oth-
er elements or litter the ground with snow

to sum up then ganymede is the lar-
gest and most massive of jupiters satellites

according lo svante arrhenius the destinies
f ilie stars chapter v gp putnams sons
the following gases have been found in tlie
vapors of several volcanoes carbon dioxide
over  carbon monoxide nitrogen hydro-
gen chlorine sulphurous acid ami traces of
ethers

in its atmosphere we find all the conditions
essential to life-water oxygen and carbon
dioxide in the proper proportions the
temperature is mild and there are bodies of
open water volcanic activity is much re-
duced and the poisonous gases are gone
from the air plant life is indicated by the
presence of free oxygen which it helps to
produce

to these facts add the appearance of
meteors which cannot be the work of na-
ture at intervals which correspond exactly
to the length of ganymedes day and there
can be little doubt that a race of intelligent
beings lives here building machines inves-
tigating natures ways as we do and seek-
ing to tell us of their existence and interest
in us common courtesy requires that we
make an attempt to acknowledge their mes-
sage it is to that end that i shall now
turn the resources of this colony

as the doctor finished speaking a hubbub
broke out over the room there were scat-
tered cheers for the inhabitants of gany-
mede for the doctor and for quaile but
the scientific group was more interested in
the last remark communication with an
unknown race on another world hundreds
of millions of miles distant how was it
to be accomplished did the doctor intend
to fire sulphur meteors back to ganymede
and thus let them know we recognized their
interest in us possibly though that seem-
ed a rather unsatisfactory means of inter-
course perhaps a better method would
be to prepare a manuscript with a key to
the language and shoot il at the satellite
but what were the chances of its ever fall-

a question naturally comes to mind why
should the moon be devoid of air while these
worlds on which the force of gravity is nearly
the same as here have dense atmospheric en-
velopes for answer we must turn to a theory
known as ihe kinetic molecular hypothesis
from il we learn that a gas is not a continu-
ous fluid hut is composed of tiny particles in
rapid motion their speed depends on tempera-
ture the hotter the gas becomes the faster
they move with sufficient heat some of them
are always hying away into space never to re-
turn the sun warms our moon to the point
where all the atmospheric gases would have
gradually leaked off once rhe volcanoes were
dead this must also be tlie case witli lo
but more gas is always coming from its active
craters europas lower temperature permits
fewer molecules to escape thus we find a
denser atmosphere ganymede and callisto are
cool enough so that only the lightest gases
have departed

ing into the right hands even supposing it
was not captured and engulfed by jupiter

as these thoughts ran through my mind
i discovered that the scientific staff
was following dr forscher out of the din-
ing hall to his office wiley was among
the group and motioned me to join them
so i fell into line wondering what was in
the wind we entered the doctors office
and assembled about his desk

 have asked you here he said to of-
fer suggestions as to the best means of com-
municating with the inhabitants of gany-
mede  should like to see this accomplish-
ed before i am forced to retire so let us
waste as little time as possible in devising a
method have you any suggestions

one of the group whom i recognized as
alvin dalton a chemist of considerable ab-
ility spoke

it would be quite possible to make a
meteor which would behave like those you
saw fifty years ago he said

undoubtedly agreed the doctor but
there would be too great a difficulty in
aiming it properly the attraction of the
earth is sufficient to capture a projectile
which comes fairly close to it but in shoot-
ing at ganymede we should have to aim
much more carefully or jupiters tremen-
dous gravitational field would pull it in
then too i would prefer something which
would lead to an interchange of messages
such as radio asked a member of the
staff of physicists

no good put in wiley we could
never make a wave reach that far the
best thats been done yet is to send a mes-
sage around the earth to reach gany-
mede the waves would have to be sixty-four
million times stronger

and even if they got there how do we
know the ganymedians would have an ap-
paratus to receive them the speaker was
dr ernst a psychologist

quaile seated at the back of the group
leaned forward through a cloud of tobacco
smoke and observed

yknow that flying machine rather took

my fancy couldnt you send it out there
and talk to the fellows first-hand

the idea is intriguing admitted the
doctor but there are difficulties none
of the tractors could carry enough synthium
to go out and back even if they could
it would take too long they are built for
a maximum velocity of fifteen thousand
feet per second not that they could not go
much faster for of course there is nothing
to hinder them but at that speed there is
barely sufficient time to detect obstructions
and avoid them you had one encounter
with a meteoric stone at high speed mr
quaile yet at that pace it would require
five years to make the trip in one direction
it was dr langleys turn to offer an idea
suppose the machine were very long
and tapered uniformly any small bodies
that chanced to meet it would hit a steep-
ly slanted surface and glance off there
would be no difficulty about building a tel-
escope which could pick up the larger ones
in time and with a gravity screen-
exactly interposed wiley that
would have a great deal of power in getting
away from the moon then too there
would be no danger of falling onto jupi-
ter if we passed too close

were getting on said the doctor i
suggest that we let mr wiley and dr
langley work out the plans for the mach-
ine and show them to me perhaps that
will be the solution

back to our apartment once more wiley
and i fell to discussing the proposed space
flyer i had imagined it would resemble
a torpedo but wileys idea was different

the streamline form he said is
adapted lo travelling in air or water but it
wouldnt suit the purpose of this machine
the idea is to present everywhere the least
possible angle lo its path so that a meteor-
ite would glance off readily no matter where
it struck if the machine had a snub nose
and curving sides the front end would be
practically flat and there would be no
chance for the obstruction to bounce off
it would go right through what we want
i a pointed end and since the machine
must be reversed to stop both ends should
be pointed something like this

chapter xi
on to ganymede

he sketched the design rapidly the
machine resembled two narrow cones
base to base coming to a sharp point at
one end and cut off at the oilier to allow
for ihe opening through which the driving
gases would escape the diameter at the
middle was about fifteen feet and the total
length about one hundred and eighty

must it be as narrow as that i asked
you dont allow for much head room
after you put in a level floor

thinking of submarines he queried
consider a moment which way will this
thing travel

why-pointed end first i suppose i
said

right and which way will the accel-
eration lend lo push you

toward the rear i said of course
the occupants will stand with their heads
toward the point so the floors will have
to be crosswise not the length of the mach-
ine

exactly wiley continued to sketch
the machine placing the driving apparatus
just back of the center with ihe generators
and cooling apparatus surrounding it add-
ing storage batteries and air tanks in the
slender forward end and finally the living
quarters near the middle

that will serve as a preliminary design
he said ill see langley after a while and
get his ideas now for some calculations
he got out his slide rule and table of
logarithms and began filling sheets of pa-
per with figures presently he emitted a
whistle

heres something to think about he
said im starting on the assumption that
the trip is to be made in a month or less
in order to do that it would only be neces-
sary to increase tile speed one and a quar-
ter feet per second each second yet half
way to jupiter the machine would be going
three hundred miles a second

it was my turn to whistle

but i objected a velocity like that
isnt safe suppose it were to meet a rock

as large as ten feet in diameter it wouldnt
be visible in the telescope more than three
hundred miles away that would leave
only one second to recognize it and change
course

true said wiley well have to find
some other way of avoiding them

he dived into ihe log-book again and pre-
sently came out with a new set of figures

if you were to use a larger acceleration
-say twenty feet per second per second-
youd save a lot of energy and get there
nearly as soon in the first two and one
half million miles or so youd reach a velo-
city of a hundred and fifty miles a second
then you could shut off the power and coast
to within two and a half million miles of
ganymede before slowing down the work
done in reaching that speed would be only
about a fourth as much as in accelerating
all the way

still a hundred and fifty miles a sec-
ond i exclaimed two seconds to get
out of the way of obstructions three hun-
dred miles off that would be an awful
strain on the pilot he wouldnt dare bat
an eye a single slip and it would be all
over

yes admitted wiley but yoitve got
to get up a pretty good speed or youd take
too long in getting there i wonder if some
sort of automatic device couldnt be ar-
ranged lo steer the machine

he tilted back in his chair felt around
for a bil of moon-grown tobacco and filled
his pipe blowing a cloud of smoke he
gazed into it absently his fingers drum-
med on the desk now and then he seized his
pencil only to lay it down again finally
he jumped up

ill go see langley he said he may
have some ideas two heads are usually
better than one on a job like this

he departed leaving me to while away
the time there was a copy of edgar
allen poes prose tales on our book
shelf and  thumbed through the leaves in
search of something worth reading again
the unparalleled adventure of hans
pfaal struck my eye aud  smiled in recol-
lection of poes idea of inhabitants of the
the outpost on the moon



moon particularly the little fellow without
ears who had visited the earth in a balloon
i wondered whether the ganymedians would
resemble human beings in any way dr
forscher apparently thought not but
wiiat other sort of creatures could possess
a high order of intelligence

i realized the futility of trying to ima-
gine the inhabitants of another world there
was no foretelling the conditions under
which they had evolved-their food their
enemies their social life the many obsta-
cles they must have surmounted in their up-
ward march we could not know until the
trip to ganymede was accomplished and
that waited on wileys ability to find a safe
mode of travel at enormous velocities

wiley came in his face wreathed in
smiels

excelsior he exclaimed or is it
eureka we have it on to ganymede
explain yourself i suggested

as i predicted two heads are better than
one langley suggested a photo-electric
cell you may have heard how sensitive
they are i recall an example some in-
ventor built a machine for the purpose of
sorting beans which made use of the differ-
ence in color of the bad ones and good ones
there was a small lamp which shot a beam
of light on the beans as they passed along
on a conveyer belt the white ones reflect-
ed enough light to keep the cell working
but when a brown one came along the cur-
rent through the cell stopped letting a trap
door fall open to drop out the undesirable
bean unfortunately however the machine
wasnt much good practically at first for it
detected beans with finger-prints or specks
of dust on them and threw them out with
the bad ones

 laughed but what has a bean sorter
got to do with ganymede

suppose such an apparatus were placed
at the eyepiece of a telescope and connected
to the controls of our space flyer so that it
would change its course whenever there was
a slight increase in the light ahead of us
the meteors would betray themselves by the
sunlight falling on them and our flyer
would be headed off out of danger

good enough i exclaimed thats

the worst difficulty taken care of now we
can go ahead

wait a minute cautioned wiley you
havent heard it all yet we can depend
on the photo-electric detector to pick up ob-
jects an inch or so in diameter but the
smallest must hit the machine now and then
the telescope lens would present quite a
large surface where are we to find an ob-
ject-glass strong enough lo withstand be-
ing hit by missiles as large as bullets at a
hundred and fifty miles a second

then why do you say on to gany-
mede

we have an idea explained wiley
though it is only an idea as yet langley
suggests that we make the photo-electric cell
sensitive to waves that will go right through
the hull of the flyer itself-high frequency
waves we could generate them aboard the
tractor and project them ahead of us then
when they struck a meteor some of them
would be reflected back to excite the cell
 think it can be done if it is we will
make plans for an expedition to ganymede

the comet

wiley demonstrated once more the
genius which had aroused dr for-
schers admiration after a month of ex-
perimenting he demonstrated the success of
his cell he had set it up on the moons
surface trained it on the sky and connected
to it a light in such a way that a flash
would announce the operation of the cell
we stood by and marveled as he tossed tiny
pebbles filings of steel and such minute ob-
jects in the path of the rays to be greeted
each time by a flash of the light without
a doubt the flyer would be safe from colli-
sions at least

from that time forward all eyes looked to
the day of departure of the expedition the
construction of the flyer was begun and
progressed rapidly i assisted from time to
time in various capacities as far as my abil-
ities permitted

quaile had been given the task of map-
ping the best route from the moon to gany-
mede and i spent some time helping him
we photographed the section of the sky


wonder stories

through which the machine would travel
seeking unknown asteroids whose presence
might hinder our progress there were a
number of them yet the danger they repre-
sented was surprisingly small all of them
were large enough to be picked up by the
detector while thousands of miles away and
when one considers that if all the known
and imagined minor planets were added to-
gether they would not equal the moon in
volume it is not difficult to realize that
they are too widely scattered to offer much
of an obstacle thus we decided on a
straight-line course after allowing for mo-
tion of the earth and jupiter in their orbits

meanwhile jupiter and his attendants
were approaching opposition at which point
they would reach a minimum distance of
three hundred and ninety million miles
the construction of the machine was pushed
to the utmost in order to have it ready in
time for that favorable situation frequent
reports to dr forscher announced the com-
pletion of this or that component part and
the whole took shape as if by magic

 superhuman feats were accomplished and
work which would have required months
under ordinary circumstances was done in
weeks at each of my frequent visits to the
scene of the assembling i was amazed at the
progress at first there was only the frame-
work a long naked skeleton of steel then
the covering appeared section by section
and was welded together in an unbroken
shining armor generators gyroscopes
batteries tanks and piping took their places
in the interior while the outside acquired
the dead-black gravity-screen diminutive
wings and disappearing skids lo be used in
gliding through the atmosphere of gany-
mede and landing on ihe ground

in a time that seemed scarcely believable
the flyer was assembled inspected and
ready for a test it was designed to carry
only five men and those who had been most
instrumental in the building of it had the
honor of proving its ability they were
wiley dr langley the chief chemist ihe
chief of transportation and dr forscher
himself quaile and i together with a
large crowd of onlookers stood by to watch
tbe machine rested horizontally on its skids

a tiny stream of luminous vapor issuing
from the stern the shining undersurface
contrasted sharply with the nearly invisible
black of the gravity-screen covering the
upper half

the crew climbed aboard through an air-
lock below and disappeared shortly after-
ward the gravity screens slid into position
the skids were withdrawn and the vapor-
cloud grew in brightness spurting out be-
hind the machine paralleled the surface
for a short distance then the rear end
dropped slightly and it headed upward in
a long arc pointing vertically upward and
receding into the blackness until only the
trailing streamer of gas was visible high
above our heads it circled about dodged
to right and left with ihe agility of a spar-
row performed lightning-like maneuvers
after a time it shot off toward the horizon
dwindled to a tiny speck and was lost to
sight in a moment we sqw it returning it
flashed among the stars turned end for end
and approached us stern first retarding
gradually with marvelous expertness it
diopped to the ground shot out the landing-
skids and came to rest a hundred yards
away the passengers appeared one by
one from the air-lock and approached the
admiring group

vxhat do yu think of it asked
 v wileys voice from one of the air-
envelopes

wonderful replied quaile most
astounding it looked like a comet gone
balmy wiley laughed

a graphic illustration he said we
might give it a name

m comet  agreed what would
be more appropriate than to name it for
the wanderers of die solar system

the suggestion was immediately popular
and forthwith the space-flyer received its
christening

there now remained only the question of
who was to make the trip the number
who wanted to go far exceeded the capacity
of the machine and it appeared that dr
forscher would have a delicate problem in
making the selection he called an assem-
bly immediately and there was a large gath-
the outpost on the moon



ering on hand in the hope of hearing them-
selves named among the lucky five

i realize fully the interest which this
journey to an unexplored world has
aroused began the doctor there are
many unique experiences in store for those
who undertake it but i doubt if anyone
here realizes the danger involved were
it not for my own selfish haste to see it an
accomplished fact i should never permit the
comet to leave the moon until it had been
thoroughly tested but  have confidence
in the foresight and ability of its designers
and in view of the satisfactory performance
on its trial vjoumey i believe that it may
reasonably be expected to reach its destina-
tion

much will depend on the resourcefulness
of those who man it however they will
meet situations which cannot be foreseen
and there is always the possibility that they
will never return in view of that fact i
cannot reasonably ask anyone to make the
journey who does not sincerely wish lo do
so he paused to give us an opportunity
to think the matter over then resumed i
have selected five men as a crew any one
of them is at liberty to withdraw if he wish-
es and  am sure he will not suffer in the
esteem of the rest there is a disappoint-
ment in store for some of you but i hope
you will see the matter as i do

there are three men present all of whom
want very much to go whom i must ask to
remain here they are soon to assume the
leadership of this colony and i do not con-
sider it wise to allow them to risk their
lives in this expedition i refer to dr
langley mr quaile and mr wiley

 looked around for the members of this
trio to see how they look the announcement
langley who stood on the edge of the gath-
ering betrayed no emotion whatsoever
he looked steadily at the doctor his face
like a mask quaile semed surprised that
he had been considered for the expedition
at all and was not upset by the announce-
ment i reflected that the big telescope was
still a novelty for him and he could content
himself with photographing the stars
wiley however was hard hit for he had
counted heavily on making the trip it

seemed a shame that he should not reap the
fruits of his efforts to make ihe trip possible
but the doctor was right he could not
risk the loss of so valuable a man

dr forscher continued those who make
up the party must be able to take a hand
in the operation of the machine and must
use their time to the best advantage in gath-
ering facts about ganymede and its inhabi-
tants the primary object of tlie expedi-
tion is to get into communication with these
creatures who probably have nothing in
common with ourselves the explorers will
find on ganymede strange surroundings un-
familiar social customs even habits of
thought different from our own they must
draw on imagination and reason rather than
experience

with that in mind i have chosen the five
men of the party dr von lichten our
medfcal adviser is the first his training
will enable him to discover the constitution
of the ganymedians ihe processes of their
bodies and their habits tlie second mem-
ber will be dr ernst whose ability as a
psychologist should help him to an under-
standing of their minds m lafourchette
the geologist and meteorologist will exam-
ine the soil and climate of ganymede mr
dalton is well known as a capable organic
chemist and has done notable work in zoo-
logy and botany in england he will study
the flora and fauna of the satellite and
to lake charge of the party while en route
and make a unified report of their adven-
tures and discoveries a man who while not
preeminently a scientist has had no little
training in astronomy and physics and much
practical experience as a writer and explor-

chapter xii
the trip begins

the last announcement overwhelmed
me the doctor must surely have over-
rated my ability to place me at the head of
the expedition but i was immediately sur-
rounding by a group who seized my hands
congratulating me on the coveted opportun-
ity the olher members of the party were


wonder stories

similarly besieged by admirers who pound-
ed their backs and wrung their hands dr
forscher waited until the excitement had
died down a bit before adding his concluding
words

jupiter is already three days past oppo-
sition there is no time to lose in forty-
eight hours the moon will be in a favorable
position for departure and i ask these five
men to be ready to leave at that time the
cornet will be stocked with provisions at
once and the members of the party will see
that their personal equipment is aboard
that is all

forty-eight hours allowed little enough
time to get ready for such an undertaking
the five of us scarcely had a minute s rest
dr vtn lichten pointed out a possibility
that had been heretofore overlooked-that
the atmosphere of ganymede might contain
bacteria to which the human body was not
immune in which case it would be danger-
ous to expose ourselves he suggested that
rubber suits be constructed which would en-
able us to move about easily and talk to
the ganymedians without exposing our-
selves bul there was not time enough wil-
ey succeded in devising microphones which
could be attached to the air-envelopes en-
abling us to hear sounds directly and make
ourselves heard and these had to serve

i had less baggage than any of the rest
taking only a table of the positions of the
known bodies of the solar system and a large
supply of writing materials i searched the
colony over for a typewriter but there was
none to be found and while it would not
have been difficult to make one the time
was too short  contented myself with a
three-inch pile of paper a dozen pens and
a quart of ink

meanwhile the moon pursued her course
around the earth reaching the full phase on
schedule we were on the far side and con-
squently the terrain was wrapped in dark-
ness when our little party of five entered
the air-lock and shot to the surface quite
a few had braved the blackness and pene-
trating cold of the lunar night to see us off
dr forscher wiley and quaile stood at the
air-lock of the comet to bid us farewell with
a handshake and a word of encouragement

wileys voice was near breaking as he said

all the luck in the universe to you old
man it wasnt necessary to him to say
how terribly he wanted to go

til bring you a ganymedian for a house-
pet i promised and climbed aboard

the interior of the machine was divided
off into compartments from end to end
by heavy bulkheads the various rooms
were cylindrical connected by a ladder
along one wall and were furnished with
tables chairs and bunks securely bolted to
the floor the aspect was rather peculiar
at present for the machine lay on its side
and the furniture appeared to hang from the
rear partition we deposited our last-min-
ute impedimenta in the living quarters and
assembled in the engine-room

the operation of the machine had been
explained to each man present but i took
charge having had experience with the trac-
tors under my direction they checked over
the readings of the various instruments
closed the gravity screen and sent the gas
roaring behind us we hung on desperate-
ly as the forward push of the acceleration
turned us upright in the room then a shift
of the gyroscopes sent us curving upward
away from the moon gaining speed rapidly

i took sight of the stars through a peris-
cope at one side heading the machine
straight for jupiter once on our course a
non-magnetic compass indicated any deflec-
tion then we covered all the portholes
against ihe onslaught of meteorites with-
drew the periscope and set the photo-elect-
ric detector working this was connected
to the gyroscopes so that whenever it picked
up an obstruction in our path it shifted
them sending us off at an angle to our
course then after a few seconds it automa-
tically righted our direction at the same
time a gong gave warning so that we could
hang on to one of the many holds provided
and save ourselves from a fall

despite the absence of gravity we stood
firmly on the floor for the push of the
driving gas held us down just as a quickly-
accelerated auto throws its occupants back-
ward there was nothing more to do for
awhile except to watch the instruments
the outpost on the moon



our acceleration was plotted on a slowly
turning sheet of paper-the sort of appara-
tus used to record changes of temperature
by weather stations it was actuated by a
weight on a spring so that the downward
push of the acceleration moved a pen and
any relaxation allowed the spring to draw
it back in the first twenty-two hours we
would have covered two and one-half mil-
lion miles and would then be traveling at
about one hundred and fifty miles per sec-
ond from then on we would coast for
nearly a month at a velocity unchanged ex-
cept for dodging meteors when the syn-
thium would be called into service for a few
seconds each time

during the first twenty-two hours we kept
a vigilant watch over the instrument board
seeking-the slightest irregularity but every-
thing functioned perfectly and except for an
occasional lurch sideways as we missed a
passing meteor there was nothing to break
the monotony

i had been introduced to the members of
the party at the dinner-table sometime be-
fore but until now we had become little ac-
quainted and as i was in charge of the ex-
pedition during the journey i felt it was up
to me to discover what sort of men were
under my guidance i took every oppor-
tunity to engage in conversation with each
and soon learned that dalton and lafourch-
ette were not on the best of terms having
published controversial theories on earth
concerning the importance of rainfall in
promoting the development of animals
physically they were almost exact opposites

it is a common impression that power must be
continually applied to maintain a constant speed
one thinks of his automobile if the engine is
stopped the car will presently come to a stand-
still but a reference to newtons first law of
motion will explain the situation briefly it
states that a body in motion will continue in a
straight line indefinitely unless compelled to
alter its motion by some force acting on it
in the case of the automobile there are always
forces at work the resistance of the air and
the friction of its own moving parts against
each other or on the road the faster the ear
goes the greater this resistance becomes until
the power applied by the motor just balances
the other forces and a state of equilibrium i
reached but if the power is cut off the re-
sisting forces tend to slow the car down until
it eventually stops out in space there were
no forces to retard us the attraction of the
sun moon and planets was cut off bv the
gravity screen and even if it were not its
effect would have been so minute as to be in-
distinguishable

the frenchman was short dark slender to
the point of emaciation and possessed of a
nervous manner and a fiery temper while
dalton stood nearly six feet a corpulent
red-faced man who look life casually

as for the others dr von lichten who
had resuscitated me after the incident of
wileys and my capture was taciturn and
inclined to keep lo himself while dr ernst
the youngest of the lot was the best mixer
he was german by birth of hebrew extrac-
tion and possessed a remarkable insight in-
to the human mind i decided that i should
prefer his company to the squabbles of dal-
ton and lafourchette or dr von lichtens
perpetual silence

meanwhile the comet flashed on
through the blackness with increasing
speed leaving the moon far behind we
arranged a schedule of watches in the en-
gine room and those off duty stowei
their baggage and made themselves comfor-
table there were provisions against the
month of travel ahead of us such as playing
cards chess men and works of fiction which
had been borrowed for the trip the jour-
ney promised to be tedious for we must
travel absolutely blind not daring to risk
leaving any of the port holes open we
would miss many interesting sights but we
consoled ourselves with the thought of those
which awaited us

the two and a half million-mile point
was reached without incident the power
was shut off and we were suddenly free of
the pushing acceleration unavoidably we
floated off the floor bumping against what-
ever happed to be over our heads we hast-
ened to put on magnetic shoes like those
wiley and i had used some of the party
were amused or disturbed over the weight-
less sensations at first but quickly over-
came their annoyance

dalton was due for the next watch and
presently looked at his time-piece and went
into ihe engine room the door remained
open and we heard his voice mingled with
lafourchettes voluble accents i was about


wonder stories

to investigate when the frenchman came
through the door muttering

whats wrong i asked anxiously
nothing was the reply monsieur
dalton is anoyed because i see fit to take a
nap 

but man thats dangerous i protested
suppose something should go wrong while
you were asleep we might all be killed
that would be very bad yawned la-
fourchette  am sorry i shall be more
cautious in the future he rolled into bed
and was fast asleep in a few seconds

we had been our way eleven days when
the little frenchmans second escapade
aroused our excitement i noted with mild
curiosity that he had carried a mysterious
bundle with him to the control room i
gave little heed at the time but when at
the end of his watch i went lo relieve him
he beckoned to me in evident excitemenl
i closed the door and inquired what had
happened

i have made a great discovery he said
bui we must keep it a secret between our-
selves and let no one else take the credit
what is it  asked

the fitzgerald contraction theory i
have proved it false

then youve been making experiments
on it

he nodded i have brought with me the
most accurate micrometer in dr forschers
laboratories before we left the moon i
measured several steel bars with great pre-
cision now we ate moving forward at the
rate of a hundred and fifty miles a second
according to the contraction theory these
bars should be much shorter when they are
placed in the line of our motion than when
they are at right angles to it vet lhat is
not the case they are always the same
length

i suppressed a desire to laugh

my friend i said you overlook a sim-
ple fact as you say the fitzgerald con-
traction theory states that a moving body
contracts in the direcion of its motion and
it is true that your steel bars should be
shorter when you point them along our
course but the theory does not exempt
micrometers yours must also be shorter

to the same extent and of course you can-
not measure the contraction when youre
measuring instrument is moving al the same
velocity

lafourchettes lace fell

but then how can the contraction be
discovered he asked

you must make your measurements on
some body which is moving past us or past
which we move in either case you would
observe the contraction the motion is on-
ly relative

then  can still do the experiment
said lafourchctte joyfully i have a small
telescope with me  will set it up in the
air lock open the outside door and look
al the planets past which we are sweeping
should ihey not appear distorted-contract-
ed sidewise

they should i agreed we are en-
tering the region of the asteroids and will
shortly pass close lo one of the largest
the orbit of pallas surrounds that of mars
and the asteroid itself is only a few million
miles from us

lafourchelte rose  shall examine it
al once he declared and disappeared in
excitement

i turned my attention to the controls
as we were among the asteroids it was
important that our detector be kepi in per-
fect order lo prevent hitting any of them
pallas lay many miles off our course but
there was no telling how many fragments
of some miscarried world lay ahead of us
even al that moment the warning gong in-
dicated the proximity of one of them and
the quick shift of the comets direction
pitched me against the wall

an hour or so later ernst entered the con-
trol room

im worried about lafourchette he
said he put on his envelope and went
into the air lock with a telescope he
hasnt come back yet do you know what
hes doing

he wanted to make an experiment
which he pledged me to keep a secret
wed best not interrupt him

nevertheless said ernst im wor-
ried
the outpost on the moon



we can talk to him with the radio of
one of the envelopes i suggested just
ask him if hes all right

ernst put on one of the helmets and call-
ed lafourchettes name i caught the fren-
zied response

help

whats the matter

come quick mon dizu i cannot get
back

take the controls i said ill go see
what the trouble is i climbed into my
envelope closed ihe outer door of the air-
lock and entered lafourchette was no-
where to be seen exhausting the air i
reopened the outer port on an amazing spec-
tacle floating parallel to the cornel a
hundred feel away lafourchette was strug-
gling and kicking frantically in a vain effort
to pitch himself toward the air lock

ill throw you a rope i called and
banging the port shut i heaved mightily on
the inner door it would not give until i
had equalized the pressures and i was
forced to wail until enough air had hissed
in through the valves inside i set about
a frenzied search for a coil of rope finally
unearthing a stretch of stout metal cord i
fastened one end about my waist and re-
turned to the air lock lafourchette had
calmed his struggles somewhat

catch this i shouted heaving the coil
into the blackness but i had unconscious-
ly thrown high to allow for gravity as on
earth the cord missed him by twenty feet
remained stretched snakily and refusing to
come closer i hauled in and tried again
this time with better success lafourch-
ette seized the free end and i pulled him
aboard he was on the verge of collap-
sing whether from fright or exposure to the
intense cold  could not tell i carried him
inside where we stripped off his envelope
he gasped violently several times

what happened we demanded in
chorus

i went out lo look at the asteroid he
said struggling for breath suddenly the
bell sounded and the comet swung side-

wise i had no chance to catch something
for a hold the machine just floated from
under me and i was left in space a little
later the comet straightened out and sailed
right along beside me i tried to kick my-
self back to swim anything at all but it
was in vain ah my friends the aggrava-
tion of it there was i a hundred feet
away yet unable to come any closer then

lo	make matters worse the air pressure in
my envelope began to fall i was nearly
suffocated when you threw the rope the
fabric must have burst somewhere

i looked over his flexible covering care-
fully but could find no break dr von
lichten picked up ihe helmet and emitted
a whistle

look at this he exclaimed a hole
clear through both front and back you
hit a tiny stone my friend which would
have drilled you more neatly than a bullet
had it touched your body you may indeed
thank your lucky stars that you are still
with us

that is whal i do not understand said
lafourchette with ihe machine speeding
along at one hundred and fifty miles per
second why was i not left behind

when you fell overboard i said you
loo were going a hundred and fifty miles
per second there was nothing to stop you
-no air no gravity you just kept on go-
ing you could have floated beside us in-
definitely unless the comet swung away
again

then my telescope is still beside us
he asked

unless it was hit by the meteor which
caused the comet to dodge shall i try to
get it for you

no said lafourchette let us take no
more risks outside the machine besides
 have seen all i wanted to

did you find the contraction

no thai accursed asteroid was per-
fectly round

perhaps we can estimate how much of a
contraction ihere should have been i said
figuring on the back of an envelope at
our velocity pallas disc should have ap-


wonder stories

peared out of shape by about three parts in
ten million

then i could not have seen it after all
said lafourchette sadly

true in order for the contraction to
become appreciable our velocity would have
to be comparable to the speed of light
that is why it is so hard to believe the
fiugerald equation if we see a railroad
train rush past without appearing a bit
shorter we are apt to say to ourselves
this contraction business is the bunk 

lafourchette had regained his normal
composure at any event he said i
have learned a lesson i shall stick to my
own science and refrain from questioning
theories which have been developed by
competent physicists until t am sure of the
ground i stand on-scientifically and per-
sonally

the days went on marked only by the
revolutions of our clock each passing hour
reeled off half a million miles eating up
the distance to our destination mv calcu-
irtions showed that we had only a few mil-
lion more lo go  decided it would be
safer to begin slowing down a little ahead
of time to allow a margin of safety our
terrific speed made it unsafe to use the
periscope for a grain of dust such as had
pierced lafourchettes helmet would wreck
it and interplanetary space was more or
less filled with such particles after figur-
ing our position as accurately as possible
by dead reckoning i allowed a million miles
to spare none of the satellites would bar
our path but jupiter lay dead ahead and
we had no desire to plunge into his atmos-
phere after slowing down to a safe speed
we could take observation and alter our
course so as to meet ganymede at the proper
time

nearing jupiter

the hour of starting up the driver would
come during lafourchettes watch i
offered to stand it as well as my own but
he insisted on taking his turn dalton had
referred to him as sleepyhead since his
first offense and his pride was hurt ac-
cordingly  set about writing up the log

of our journey dr von lichten was asleep
in his bunk and dalton and ernst were at
one of their innumerable chess games hav-
ing loaded the board and the chess-men
with magnetized iron so that they would
remain in place despite the lack of gravity

this last circumstance made my writing
difficult for  had to lean against the wall
and my ink showed a great disinclination
to slay in the bottle to add to my dis-
comfiture i found myself unable to collect
my thoughts i wrote a word crossed it out
and re-wrote it unable to make up my
mind i became increasingly drowsy and
finally fell into a doze

 awakened with a hazy realization that
the gong connected to the detector had rung
my head must have knocked sharply against
the wall though the throb of the blow seem-
ed far off and unimportant my glance fell
idly on ernst and dalton standing at
grotesque angles sound asleep beside their
chessboard the spectacle was amusing
but slowly i realized that something must
be done with painful slowness i dragged
my feet into the engine-room and found
lafourchette blissfully unconscious i
peered drunkenly at the instrument board
my befogged brain unable to fathom the
meaning of the many indicators slowly i
grasped the fact that the air was horribly
foul i struggled toward the emergency
oxygen tank and wrestled with the valve un-
til it gave pouring the life-giving gas into
the room standing near the tank i inhaled
deeply and soon recovered my strength
then i grabbed lafourchette by the shoul-
ders and dragged him to the valve it was
a minute or so before he recovered con-
sciousness protesting that he had been asleep
only a moment  looked at the clock we
should have begun slowing up two hours
ago

yelling directions at lafourchette i set
the gyroscopes turning and reversed the

the equation for the fiugerald contraction is

v -

ij - lo	c ij represents the length of

the body in motion lo the length of that body
at rest v the velocity of the body when in mo-
tion or the relative velocity between the body
and the observer and c the velocity of light
putung these values in the equation it becomes

l-lo v t -	which comes out

 it lo a contraction of 
the outpost on the moon



comet in another second the gas was
shrieking through the discharge tube the
sudden acceleration sending me to my
knees we rushed into the living room to
find ernst and dalton sprawled on the par-
tition and dr von lichten half out of his
bunk with his feet tangled in the covers we
disentangled them and hauled them into the
engine-room there lying by the wide open
oxygen valve they quickly recovered con-
ciousness asking in great bewilderment
what had happened i exclaimed briefly
that the oxygen apparatus had got out of
order and the bad air had rendered us all
unconscious dalton raised up and pointed
an accusing finger at lafourchette

sleepyhead he shouted dreaming
on the job again no thanks to you that
were all not dead now

from those unmentionable cigars of
yours retorted the frenchman it is a
wonder we have not been asphyxiated be-
fore

i intervened to stop further argument

we are going too fast for safety i
said with jupiter less than two and a half
million miles away ive had to reverse the
comet by dead reckoning the detector
isnt turned around yet so we are unpro-
tected from collisions ill have to take a
chance on using the periscope to get our
bearings

this was a risky proceeding though the
streamer of gas rushing out ahead of us
offered some protection against small dust
fragments floating in space i uncovered
the tube and extended il enough to get a
view of the path ahead of us

for a few seconds the flaming streamer
of gas from the disintegrating synthium
blinded me then through- the brilliant
blue-yellow haze i caught a glimpse of
something which froze ray stomach-a shin-
ing circle

in one bound i reached the gyroscope
controls and swung the comet off at a
tangent the others had sensed my panic
and stood motionless five-ten-fifteen
seconds passed nothing happened i re-
turned to the periscope just in time to see

the pitted surface of one of jupiters tiny
outer satellites sweep past seemingly only
a stones throw away in reality we had
missed it by a mile or more yet our ter-
rific speed reduced that distance to a hun-
dredth of a second in time by so small a
margin had we missed ending our journey
prematurely a tangled mass of heated metal
against a pigmy member of the jovian sys-
tem so small as to be visible from earth
only in the very largest telescopes

incongruously enough i roared in half-
hysterical laughter the wave of relief
which swept over me reduced me to useless-
ness for the moment but dr von lichten
retained the presence of mind to swing the
beam of high-frequency waves which actu-
ated ihe detector ahead of us thereby pre-
venting the possibility of another such en-
counter then  looked out again to
straighten out our course

jupiter lay off to the right with gany-
mede beyond moving majestically along in
its orbit now that we had our bearings
once more we could change our course so
as to meet it at the far side of its path
heading close to jupiter on the way i
explained the situation and told the others
of my decision then we made sure that
the gravity-screens were in position and the
portholes all tight for it would not do to
expose ourselves to jupiters attraction at
the short distance we would pass him we
agreed that for the rest of the trip two of
us would always be present in the engine
room and dalton and i volunteered for the
first shift

it was not necessary for both of us to
watch the instrument board constantly so i
took the first turn between us we were to
stand an eight-hour watch during which
time we would rcach our minimum distance
from jupiter the realization of that fact
kept me constantly alert for the slightest
variation in the instruments but there was
none we continued our rapidly slackening
flight rushing toward our destination near-
ing the belted planet around which gany-
mede revolves at the end of four hours
dalton relieved me and i set about record-
ing the latest incidents

chapter xiii
signs of danger

we must have been about half a mil-
lion miles from jupiters surface when
dalton remarked

the acceleration indicators a little
high

 walked over to the instrument board
for a look we were slowing down a little
too much the needle had risen two-tenths
of a foot per second on the scale

no harm in a little deviation like that
i remarked as i slipped the controlling
rheostat into the next notch and resumed
my place in a half hour more our angling
course carried us a hundred and fifty thou-
sand miles closer

accelerations up again said dalton
this time the indicator had risen three-
tenths of a foot  again corrected the dis-
crepancy wondering at the steady increase
dalton spoke again

its getting hot the thermometers up
three degrees

probably from the extra heal of the
driver i suggested

in the next few minutes all the instru-
ments began to misbehave slightly the
gyroscope compass indicated that we were
a fraction of a degree off our course to-
ward jupiter the temperature continued to
rise the photo-electric detector went into
action with remarkable persistence shift-
ing our direction about continuously and at
random and the acceleration crept up
again

these disorders were no serious but they
were unexpected and disturbing f urther-
more when  again cut down the accelera-
tion i realized that the sound of the gas
had unquestionably diminished from its
usual note the synthium was not over-
working some other force was holding us
back the temperature of the interior rose
until we had to shut off the electric heaters
the detector sent us skipping about with
alarming frequency and our course tended
more and more toward jupiter could it
be that his atmosphere extended as far out
as this and that we were encountering its

outer limits that would account for the
heal of the comet and the increased retard-
ing

as we approached our nearest point to
jupiter it became apparent that this was
not the explanation the detector misbe-
haved so badly that we were forced to shut

il	off at the risk of a collision while all the
electrical apparatus acted queerly there
were strange noises from the headgear of the
air-envelopes due to the static disturbances
broadcast by their receivers even without
the electric heaters the temperature inside
the machine rose steadily the acceleration
continued to increase and our course had
to be constantly corrected to prevent our
heading straight for jupiter

the simple explanation of these phenom-
ena dawned on me in a burst of compre-
hension we were in a strong magnetic
field nor was i too long in discovering
its source the earth three hundred times
less massive than jupiter has an easily re-
cognized field which has been used for cen-
turies to guide mankind by its effect on the
compass needle in view of jupiters great
size was it surprising that he should have
a field many times stronger given that
the electrical and other phenomena follow-
ed as a natural consequence

let us refer for a moment to the effect
of moving a metallic conductor near a mag-
net under certain circumstances there
will be a current induced in the conductor
and according to the law of lenz this cur-
rent tends to oppose the inducing influence
there is a simple rule for remembering the
relation of these effects extend the right
hand with the index finger straight ahead
the thumb vertical and the middle finger
pointing to ihe left the middle finger in-
dicates the direction of motion the thumb
that of the magnetic field and the index
finger the flow of current from positive to
negative the shell of the comet was a
good conductor of electricity and the in-
duced currents eddying through it opposed
our motion expending their energy in
slowing us down and heating up the inter-
ior the wiring of the detector experienced
a similar flow of current which sent us
dodging hither and thither while the ir-
the outpost on the moon



regularities of the field announced their
presence in the squawking radios

this is about as close as well get an-
nounced dalton from the instrument-board
we were just outside the orbit of io the
magnetic disturbance had reached its
height in a flash of inspiration  saw the
answer to the puzzling heat of the satellites
they too experienced jupiters strong field
they were doubtless able to conduct electric-
ity as well as the earth the vast eddy-cur-
rents in their interiors must give rise to high
temperatures which could not have other-
wise existed

ernst and von lichten who presently re-
lieved us had noted the behavior of the
cornet arid were considerably upset but
my explanation set their fears at rest and
they accepted my prediction that the annoy-
ing situation would disappear as we drew
pagt jupiter

when my next turn in the pilot-house
came we were moving slowly enough to
permit use of the periscope without danger
ganymede lay to our right a brilliant
dazzling moon beyond and somewhat
above was callisto smaller and paler 
turned the glass about the tremendous
shadow of jupiters dark side hid a gen-
erous circle of the sky bounded on the left
by a gigantic crescent the sun as always
shone among the countless stars but it was
a shrunken discouraged orb of day whose
face lighted these far-off worlds

close by him in the constellation of
libra was a star of the -third magnitude
insignificant except for the fact that it had
no place in the familiar order of things
this was the planet men like to think the
most important spot in the universe to call
the home of gods chosen ones-the earth

man listened incredulously but she allowed
him to finish

your man is now a machine concluded
the doctor and as far as you are concerned
he is dead

the woman jumped from the cot in wild
hysteria she ran about the room crashing
things and cursing

you are all damn liars she shouted
hell-hounds and liars she fell upon ot-
to and the doctor who were trying to quiet
her and bit and tore and scratched she
struggled and fought until panting and all
but exhausted she fell to the floor the
room was a wreck

finally she looked up at the doctor like a
dumb brute in distress and whined give
him back to me will yuh aw go on
give him back to me

again he doctor with all patience reas-
oned with her explaining that her hopes
were futile

she whimpered for some time then she
looked up at dr farnum and with bosom
heaig and eyes as cold as steel said

ill kill you like a dog the first chance
i get ill kill you as sure as hell

you wont kill anybody maintained
the surgeon remember girl i brought
him back to life and let him live after they
had electrocuted him

she pondered alternately wiping at her
eyes with a bit of handkerchief and instinct-
ively dabbing at her nose with a powder
puff suddenly she looked up with a queer
light in her eyes and moaned if it wasnt
for yon he wouldnt even be breathing
most certainly not repeated the doctor
now will you go and leave him to me
cant i see him sometime

what good would it do

maybe no good but id like to see him
sometimes

it was the doctors turn to ponder fin-
ally he said if you will cut out the rough
stuff and settle down and go straight ill
give you a job taking care of him

will you on the level fairly screeched
the girl a strange light in her eyes

the

absolutely but you cannot expect any-
thing but his nearness he will not be alive
to your presence

i dont care said the girl happily and
with dog-like devotion ill be near him
that you will agred farnum

and so began the strangest part of the
unearthly case day in and day out the
gorilla girl losing interest in all else at-
tended the mechanical man tenderly

hand in hand they could be seen walking
about the surgeons garden the girl her
criminal spirit broken lived only for the
shell of a man who had once been her near-
est associate and lover what solace she
got from such companionship probably on-
ly a woman can explain but she appeared
almost happy at times

this strange situation endured through
many months but the surgeon keeping
close observation of both the woman and
the man-machine noted that the gorilla
girls health was failing she seemed to
have lost all interest in life

then the end came suddenly and trag-
ically it happened but on reflection farnum
realized that it was in keeping with the other
events in the weird chain dr farnum
missed a quantity of a deadly poison from
his stores divining that she had helped
herself to the drug he rushed to the little
rooms over the garage

there he found them-lying together on
the one cot the gorilla woman and the man-
machine dead in each others arms on the
table was a note and it read

i always felt helpless unless i was
fighting but it aint no use-no use
at all i cant fight anymore a
woman cant go on forever like this
hes the only thing i got and hes
dead all but the wires so i poison-
ed him and will kill myself im sor-
ry we both didnt do right we could
have lived on what we earned working
but we didnt we thought we was so
wise we called everybody dumb-

i broke off suddenly the ground be-
neath our feet was shivering and heaving
and for a moment i doubted the evidence
of my eyes the next moment it was still
again and i was about to ridicule the idea
when follansbee grasped me by the arm

did you feel that he said for gods
sake get that launch on the water there
is going to be a lot of funny things happen
here before long come on

in less than twenty minutes we were in
sight of the ship once more and then it was
that follansbee made the final remark

not a word about our adventures he
warned ill get sparks to radio port
moresby for a destroyer to clean up that
island i suppose that it will be necessary
to give them a bare outline

and i turned to see the foreshore of the
island still brooding and sinister disap-
pearing into the tropical night

there is but one incident worth while
recording however and it took the form
of a radiogram that follansbee received af-
ter his detailing the story to the naval auth-
orities at port moresby

tude given find no trace o island sus-
pect some elaborate hoax am temporarily

what is the explanation of that message
can it be as follansbee informed me that
ho ming made his headquarters on one of
these roving islands that are never in the
same place for any length of time were
the mysterious tremors we felt forerunners
of another upheaval

and if that is so i often pause to think
of the misguided genius that lies fathoms

ray cummings

master of science fiction has written for us his new short gem
the great transformation

here is a story intense from the first to the last word the theme is as big as the
whole race and is a symbol of the destiny of the race what is it that separates us from
the brute that gives us our intelligence humanity and our soul mr cummings answers
these iuestions in this the most dramatic of his stories

dr david h keller
breaks his long silence in our columns to entertain and thrill our readers with his new story
of a gigantic international plot

the sleeping war

is in every sense a modern story it shows that if a small group wished to control our
lives and destinies they would take advantage of the best scientific knowledge and they
would bring about very gently a state of affairs that would strike terror nto the heart of
every man woman and child

p schuyler miller

winner of the air wonder stories cover contest is one of our real finds he brings
to science fiction a freshness of viewpoint and a vivid method of telling a story his latest

dust of destruction

is by far the best we have seen from him a menace more terrible than anything a human
could conceive strikes at the earth in the swirling masses of dust that drift to earth there
is contained a suggestion of terrible death for millions a fiendish plan of inhuman brains   
this is an interplanetary story par excellence

joslyn maxwell

is taking us now to little ganymede satellite of the giant jupiter where we are to take
part in the last acts of this stirring interplanetary drama

the outpost on the moon

here we are to meet face to face a strange raee whose minds and hearts our expedition
must plumb what are the strange plans of these people    will the expedition succeed

 uranium is one of the most radio-acthe of met-
als like radium uranium disintegrates almost fip n-
taneously though slowly into alpha and beta parti-
cles and lea es lead as a remainder it also shoots
off into space a a result of the disintegration as does
radium the short gamma rajs

	the speed of sound varies in the different med-
iums about  feet per second may be accepted
as a fair average value in air

	many methods have been proposed for disinte-
grating the atom some scientists propose to speed
up the electrons so that they shall anally acquire
enough of a peed to bieak loose fiom the proton
others want to use a physical contact by bombarding
the atom with tree electrons und so knocking some of
the electrons loose others want to cause the disinte-
gration by pulling the proton out of its atom

the latest theories however indicate that the re-
lease of atomic energy will not come from the dis-
ruption of the atom millikan and others believe that
it will require just as much energy to disrupt the
atom as it would provide millikan states that ato-

mic energy is released by the building up of one kind

perpetual motion in space

editor science question and answer

i nolo that you answered mv questions in tlia oc
tober issue of wosdku stories on sun spots and
perpetual motion in space  thank you very kindly
for doing so i wonder if you would answer just one
more

hero it is  you said that motion in space was per
pctual did yon not well in that case why would
a rocket traveling toward some planet or star need
rocket motors or any other kind of power to move it
along after leaving the earth

c	w crede

- ttoane st

charleston w ya

the planets that have what wc called perpetual
motion are moving in orbits in which there is no re-
sistance to stop them and the centrifugal force of
their motion is balanced by the gravitational pull ol
the sun they wcr originally set in motion by some
external force such as the grai itational pull ot an-
other sun which passed by our luminary some hun
dreds of millions of years ago

now in order lor a rocket to have perpetual motion
it must leave the earth and itself fall into an orbit
about the earth the sun or some other heavenly body
the orbit will depend on the size of the heavenly bndv
about which it is to circle the distance from that
body and the speed therefore if the rocket leaves
the earth and at a distance of some  miles above
the earth acquires a speed of some live miles per sec-
ond parallel to and with reference to he rtli it
will have acquired perpetual motion anil will circle
the earth in perpetuity similarly if it leaves the
earth and speeds along in the earths orbit until i is
let us say on the other side of the orbit front the
earth and it acquires a speed of  miles per second
the same as the earths speed about the sun it will
circle the sun in perpetuity just as the earth does
without further expenditure of power but power must
first be used to raise the body from the earth and
give il a definite orbit around some body which it is
to circle otherwise it is subject to the gravitational
attraction of he heavenly bodies close to it-editor

determining the densities of stars

eduor science questions and ituwrs

will you explain to me how it is possible to determine
tli density of stars f

willis rader

th street

wellsburg w va

the density of a body is the amount of matter per
unit volume therefore if the weight and the volume
of a body are known the density can be found

the method in practice of finding both the weight
and volume of distant stars is quite lengthy and com-
plicated but ihe following summary is a simple ex-
planation

when a stars distance is known and it can be found
by triangulation we can determine how intrinsically
bright it is oy our knowledge of its apparent bright-
ness in other words wc know how much light reaches
us and by knowing how far away the star is we can
calculate how bright it must be at its source

wc can albo di-termine from this by eliminating the
loss in radiation how much energy the sun or star is
pouring oat to us we also know the output of energy
per unit area that reaches us for this depends on its
surface temperature which we hare determined by ther-
mocouples etc from these two figures we can arrive
t the number ol square inches of surface of the star
and so can calculate its volume

to find the weight of the star indirect means are
the only ones possible except for double or binary atars

whose weights can be found directly the relationship
of the weight of known stars to their other qualities are
tabulated and star are arranged into groups when
the weight of a new star is desired its known piopertiea
automatically put it into one of the weight groups
and so its weight is approximated from the weight
and the volume the density can be found it is evi-
dent that there is much that is relative and experi-
mental in this method of approach-editor

will you kindly answer this question in your

what is the difference in construction between tbs
infrared and the ultra-violet lamp

charles williams

chicago iii

one type o ultra-viole lamp is an electric lamp
that permits ihe ultra-violet rays to penetrate through
the glass bulb almost cvcrv radiant body such as
the sun or a- incandescent electric filament nr an
arc lamp emits waves of radiant energy including
heat light and ultra-violet rays the ordinary glass
bulb preents the ultra-violet rays from penetrating
just as a glass window stops the ultra-viole raya of
the sun from entering a room by using quartz as
the bulb or in the case of a window quartz panes

a new type of
simple ultra-violet
lamp when the
current is turned
on the tungsten
filament is heated

the ultra-violet ray can penetrate thus a new ultra-
violet lamp on the market is merely a high powered
electric lamp with a quartz bulb a more expensive
lamp uses a tungsten filament which heats a pool of
mercury and causes a mercury arc this is used
because the energy emitted by the glowing mercury
arc is rich in ultra-violet lays a rcflector is general-
ly used to concentrate the raya on any given area

the infra-red lamp if one may call it such is
merely n coil of heated wire in back of which in a
reflector to concentrate the heat rays the infra-red
raya arc in other words heat ray thin wire ia used
in a coil the current being adjusted so that the coil
heats up but not enough lo emit much light the
heat waves radiated hit the reflector generally of a

a letter from the german interplanetary

society

editor wonder stories

we wish to give the readers of wonder stories
some news about the verein fur raumscliiffahrt
i v society for spatial navigation or interplane-
tary society of germany and first to thank mr hugo
gernsback for the kindness of publishing this

the officers of the german interplanetary society
have gone through a number of weeks of very hard
work we have succeeded in securing near berlin a
suitable rocket flying field a large field on which the
starting supports for the different rockets were set
up there are likewise several buildings which are
now being equipped with machinery so that next year
we can work on a very large scale

in the meantime important rocket experiments have
been performed by the technicians of the society the
engineers ncbel and kiedel-experiments dealing with
the combustion of liquid fuels gasoline with liquid
oxygen experiments on the ignition of liquid rockets
on the stabilizing of rockets in flight on the arrang-
ing of the fuel chambers and on the rocket parachute
which brings the burned out rocket safely back to
earth

it is a great pleasure for us to be able to say that
all these experiments despite their great difficulty have
been successful ignition stabilizing and the releas-
ing of the parachute were problems which came out
successfully with our experimental apparatus de-
tails about these experiments will be given in our next
bulletin but we merely want to inform america by
these few lines that the german interplanetary so
eiety lias not gone to sleep and that our work has
brought the world another step nearer the final goal
this goal is the space ship as our president prof h
oberth has shown in the film for which he was advisor
the oirl in the moon

willy ley secretary

berlin nw  scharnliorststr
germany

tose who look forward eagerly to the time when
further experiments  shooting rockets into space
will be performed can be heartened by this illuminating
letter steadily but quietly our german friends an
going about the sifting of the possibilities of fuel de-
sign etc so that as they say a space ship will finally
result the mathematical problems have already been
settled we know now what conditions are necessary
for a space flight it is a question then of finding
tools and engines that fit those conditions

after all space flying is too great a matter to bo
limited by national pride and jealousy we are sure
that all americans extend their hands across the seas
to wish the german interplanetary society the best
of luck and we will look forward eagerly to the day
of the first shot into infinity no matter what na-
tion or group sponsors it-editor

something else to kill

editor wonder stories

 believe i have been getting your magazine long
enough to give you my opinion about it your maga-
zine is supposed to be about  scientific but now
you are changing it to a travelling zoo i for the love
of mike take those gosh-dnrned five million year-
old animal out such as the war lord of venus

the hero could hardily sleep or walk a quarter of a
mile without meeting fantastic dinosaurs or something



else to till that kind of story is too dramatic cut
it out

secondly more futuristic stories and get something
more than wars in those future stories thirdly more
interplanetary stories how about a trip to planet
xf

fourthly on the new editions dont make ihe titles
too big and slant it a little up to the right it spoils
the cover as it now is

aside from the war stories i yonder stories
cant be beat now mr editor  implore you to
print this in the reader speaks and see if many
will agree with me more interplanetary stories and
less wars and may wonder til dries never suc-

venus now it is our belief that every red blooded
man thrills to the call of adventure and danger and
when those two elements are combined with mystery
and intrigue then the combination is well-nigh un-
beatable wc dont think that mr roby wants us to
eliminate drama all together it is merely a question
of how much to inject into our stories that question
we refer to our readers shall it bo the more ex-
citement the merrier or shall stories be more staid
instead of doing things shall our characters sit
about a camp fire and talk as the greek philosophers
did until the first streaks of dawn your comments

headed im only is

one thing good about your mag i can read it
type face is clear and all that im a printer by trade
so i appreciate it some mags cant even be read
decently even if the contents arc- good

lust one thing you have these time-travelling yarns
good stuff to read all right but bunk you know be-
cause if thens no such thing as time which there
isnt only change how can one travel in or on
something that doesnt exist to our planet whirling
round the sun there is simply a turning and warming
of one side and then the other time i e years days
hours minutes etc is something purely artificial
invented by man to tell him when to do certain things
work and  stop work etc especially the stop work
part no offense mr editor

mr frederick c hehr hit the bulls eye in his re-
ligion vs science comments truest thing out no mat-
ter what it is find out for yourself and dont go off
half-rocked hear hear every time mr hehr

 the north star known to astronomers as
alpha ursac minoris is u light years or -
j rauea away from us

	the simplest method of finding- a nearby stars
distance is to use a method of triangulation on a
certain date a telescope is pointed at the star and the
angles between the star and its neighbors in the
field of the telescope are measured six months
later the same thing is done the earth has now
moved  miles from its previous position
csing this as a baseline and having the two angles
by trigonometry the stars distance can be calculated
however for very distant stars even this method fails
and a method of spectroscopy must be used-editor

continued from page 

according to a certain modern gentleman knowu
as albert einstein time and space are parts of the
same thing neither can be divorced from the other
so if time has no reality then neither has space the
best analogy to time that we have run across is that
of a river flowing from the past lo the future travel-
ling in time means getting out of the river getting
into another dimension and jumping ahead to an-
other part of the -stream then we can anticipate ihe
flow of events-editor

a pain in his neck

editor woxdeb stories

youll have to pardon me if i should step on your
toe but frankly you give me a pain in the neck not
to men ion various other anatomical divisions

despite your loudly proclaimed policy of printing
brickbats not a single letter protesting against the
so-called hange of -sue was published in the read-
ers columns last issue dont say you didnt receive
any i you didnt print mine of course it came too
nc-ar to home base but out of fairness of any i ex-
pected you to print some less pointed ones but you
merely state that the change has met with nearly un-
animous approval-which i dont believe unless the
readers are all crazy-then you pat yourself on the
back with a few commendatory letters

when you do publish a letter from one who is too
honest or too unafraid lo not give his honest opinions
it is immediately followed by letters from readers
who tear viciously into this most vile person who
dares tell you where to get off

t am not going to call you pet names to get my
letter printed-you who have forfeited your right lo
editorship when you betrayed your trust to your
readers by allowing such a backward measure

i did intend tc wrile this on a postal card so unit
every mail cfcrk between hero and queens county
could read it but  found x had too much to say

of course it is an improvement that one page is
 of an inch higher than its neighbor lhat the edges
are rough and the paper cheap ii any paper is cheup
also that if one finds that a story by his favorite
author a rare thing to find indeed these daysl
is on page  ami he runs through the mag to find
it and finds himself suddenly from page  to page
 or some such page

though of course you will find it convenient to
politely ignore this letter please remember that i make
no secret of my name or address that  have refrained
from obscene language-a thing which you accue
one of your critics of uot doing

harry puneoast

wilmington del

frankly wo have received very few letters of criti-
cism on the new size and shape of wosder stories
if there was any criticism at all it was that some
readers objected to the rough edges this too is sur-
prising because actually by count over os of the
so called pulp magazines on the newsstands in tho
small size are with rough edges

tho reason for this is purely a mechanical one
and it lias been accepted as a standard in pulp pub-
lishing practice

the extra cost in giving smooth edges is so trifling
that we have decided with the february issue to
adopt the smooth edges inasmuch ns a number of
our readers seem to like ibis slvle better the extra

eost tor the eniire edition is less than   and

we gladly contribute ibis amount even if only a
few readers have voiced their displeasure with the
rough edges

as to the paper we believe we use as good or more
expensive grade of paper ilian any of the pulp paper
magazines

as for the quality of the printing we are spend-
ing an average of from eight to ter percent more
to get better printing not only on the inside but
cn the outside as well

so much for shop talk

as to the paragraph where our correspondent
claims that the pages jump suddenly from  to
 he simply voices an ignorance of the production
of magazines in general all magazines are made up
in what is known ns signatures of either  or 
pages these are gathered by a gathering machine
which is supposed not to make any mistakes but
even machines are not infallible and sometimes it
happens that due to a variation of the paper or for
other mechanical reasons a signature that is  group
of  pages is dropped or a signature is duplicated
this happens with all magazines but it is rather an
infrequent occurrence any render who gets a muti-

lated copy that has duplicated signatures or has
pages missing knows that his newsdealer will give
him another copy in exchange free of charge if
he cannot get satisfaction irom his newsdealer we
invite him to write to us imnediatcly and wc will
forward another copy

by the readers discussion that more downright criti-

no kidding though i am an old lohn reader of

magazine and say that theres our magazine by
cracky i a magazine fr the readers wants i and
i mean ill i like your magazine its new size and its
illustrations one think i dont like dont have
those authors pictures taking up space that should bo
used for fiction once seen is enough

the best story you ever printed was in the first is-

you never did gel us that sequel tssk -tssk--mr
editor youre in it falling down on ns

the reader speaks

altho there have been a few linfortunate events
resulting from our policy of free and open discussions
tuo results are such that we are still heartily iu favor
of it friends iu newspaper aud magazine circles in
new york tell us that we have oue of the most inter-
esting readers columns in the city aud that aonu- of
them buy the magazine chiefly to read this fascinating
department

we only wish that space permitted us to extend this
department the editors certainly find a great deal
of enjoyment in it and for their own sake alone they
would not change it

after all science fiction is a young art-it needs
continual freshness new ideas new authors new read-
ers we are getting them all and we are therefore
happy we would really like to know from our read
ers the one best story we have published so far and
we would like to know the reason why was it just
because or was it because the story was exciting
plausible thrilling well worked out had good atmos-
phere etc write to us and tell us about it and well
print tha best letter-editor

no place for prejudice

editor wonder stories

por quite a while t have intended to air some of
my thoughts and opinions on wonder stories in
the department reserved for that purpose i put the
matter off until now and consequently i will write
about essentials only

ever since december  i have intended to
mention a seemingly obvious scientific error in a
story in mr h gernsbacks first science fiction maga-
zine no other reader called attention to this er-
ror causing me to half-believe that  was wrong
and the author right the author-kaw in the
time eliminator--insiuuated that it takes hours
for light from mars to reach the earth i

now that i have that out of my mind ill de-
vote the rest- of this letter ti itoxder stories

the readers are constantly pointing out erfors in
science and what they believe are fallacies so the
magazine apologizes for errors by eorrectiug them
but what about errors in other things besides
ciencei not typographical errors such as saving
harold and wilbur wright invented the airplane
but misrepresentations that give people false impres-
sions of a people and a country science fiction has
no plaec for nationalist prejudice

at first i tolerated isaac r nathansons piece of
jingoism then upfn reading miss ruperts letter
praising natliansor as an artist i could no longer keep
my opinion to n-self without being guilty of being
too lazy to writ in about it

x too thoiut the falling planetoid was good
as a story but when i came to that jingoistic para-
graph i lost any admiration i might have had for the
author he said io brief that conimunistically-
minded wretches in godless russia didnt care if
johnny bulls island was wiped off the map and
citizens of the good chinese republic hoped that pun-
ishment might befall the country that had taken part
of manchuria away from them  cant find com-
munistically in the dictionaries i possess commun-
istic would have served the purpose just as well tho
word seems to be like the pseudo-adverb electronical-
ly but this is unimportant nathanson would sav
there is no such word as jingoistic either

the men who run russia are not wretches and
are not communistically-mindedwhich is meant to
be a wicked state of mind by nathanson and even
the newspapers did not say anything about russia
taking a part of manchuria away from the chinese
instead the more liberal papers told us that the soviet
army invaded manchuria only to concede everv foot
of the invaded territory back to the chinese  the
good chinese republic with its perpetual civil war
its war lords famine and foreign exploiters is not
in the control of russian battleships and troops

of course t know that its the thing for most auth-
ors to slander tho soviet republic but in the verv
issue of wonder stories containing the falling
planetoid francis flagg also mentioned russia and
in a very favorable manner indicating that he isnt a
victim of propaganda like nathanson and that iiov-
der stories has a liberal policy at least

i have noted with interest that woxder stories
is championing several interplanetary societies one

b  jones

- greenwood st

tamaqua ienna

we aro afraid that mr jones missed the point of
mr nathansons satire in the falling planetoid
mr nalhansons whole point in his story was to show
that even when faced with a universal catastrophe tho
nations of the earth could not forget their suspicions
jealousies petty selfishness and bickering he want-
led to show that from the point of view of englishmen
the people of russia were probably commu nistieally-
tninled wretches and that these wretches did not
care if the english were wiped ont the chinese
likewise were quite satisfied that the russians should
be eliminated very gently from the face of the earth
ilis whole point therefore was to show us that national
psychology does not change even when every nation
is face with utter destruction we believe therefore
that stories like his serve a very useful purpose in re-
vealing to us our own stupidity

unfortunately it would be difficult to properly judge
the merits of space flyers without a great deal of tech
nieal discussion and thought the problem of con-
structing a space flyer are much more involved than
ihe layman imagines and though wonder stories
as the magazine of prophecy is eager to help any step
toward the furthering of interplanetary travel and its
columns are always open to a discussion of its prob-
lems it believes that the more technical features
should be referred for example to the american in-
terplanetary society-editor

yon invite comment on the size of the new maga-
zine my answer is yes and no the new size is han-
dier all right but you seem to give us fewer stories
i am in favor of smaller pictures and more stories
but not such very long stories

in general i think your magazine is improving
but there is still loom for improvement  like ex-
citing stories like hornets of space by the way
i notice that mother story by r p starzl king of

from the twentieth century lo alter events that had

shrieks to the skies

editor wonder stories

i get a lot of fun out of criticizing the magazine so
im going to try to make it a point to give you my
opinion of each issue

as a whole i thought it was pretty good the new
size certainly was an improvement it was much
more convenient to carry and more comfortable to
hold while reading yon made a good move there all
right i dont know much about the problems involved
in printing a magazine but i wonder if its necessary
to hove the edges of the magazine uneven the way
you have ft is very difficult to turn to any particular
place in the magazine

then theres the matter of the rover is it neces-
sary to have it quite so lurid it makes a person
darned uncomfortable to be seen iu public with a
magazine that shrieks to the skies  know of no
other periodical with the exception of your former
magazine which boasts such a blatant cover t guess
all of these things are none of my  business
but i thought id just suggest them and let you do
what you please with them

in my criticisms fine will mean that ihe story was
extremely interesting and one that i enjoyed through-
out good will mean that the story kept my interest
most of the way passable will mean that the story ws
merely good enough to pass the time with but i didnt

care for it particularly poor is self explanatory

the time annihilator good

the house in the clouds iinr it was better
than most stories of this type in that it did not deal
with a person who intended to conquer the earth but
who was frustrated by the hero however there are
one or two things which are not mad clear why
should the professor  share your dislike of this
word build this drome which serves no apparent
purpose and why on earth cant he build another
after the destruction of the first j

the invulnerable scourge good this story
was saved from disgrace merelv by the authors style
the plot or idea was unutterably ancient and boring
must such things be

lords of the deep a crime an outrage i your
magazine is supposed to be science fiction but t chal-
lenge you to present one shred of evidence that this
story is such even that might be excused were it
not for the antediluvian plot and poor treatment
you have a decision to make in my humble estima-
tion you have either to change the name and scopo
of your magazine or youll have to stop printing such
rot as this story

hornets of space good good treatment and
a fairly good plot

war lord of venus fine bridge writes en-
terlniugly and he has a subject that lias not been ex-
hausted it is a pity that the story is marred by tho
fact lhat it really does not belong in the magazine

as i said the issue as a whole was well up to the
standard of todays science fiction magazines but there
is a lack of anything outstanding in it i await with
interest a story by bay cummings he is practically

the only author who slill writes stories equal to thoso

mr waite is one of the most intelligent of our
younger critics and we can always depend upon him
to give us a short brief but pungent comments on
our stories he does not waste words nor does he
try to flatter or lambast us his judgment is un-
prejudiced so say what he will we are glad to get it

the record for the november issue according to mr
waite gives ns two fines  three goods and one-
well one that he didnt care for-as was evident
from such ail astute critic we are inclined to accept
this as a sign tl at the issue was pretty good

we disagree with him however on the lack of science
in lords of the deep  the question of the relics
of raster island is one with as many scientific impli-
cations as that of the geologic past of the race how-
ever we are inclined to agree with him on one point
we think that the word wonder should suggest things
of the future rather than those of ihe past and our
aim is lo print principally stories that turn the mind
forward into the future

however we invite mr waite lo send us his com-
ment each month they are very helpful and as to
those-ahem-lurid covers what do our readers

wife says its possible

editor wonder stories

both my wife and myself are regular readers of
your wosder stories and naturally there are
iots of stories we read lhat call for discussion and op-
inion in a number of slories dealing with time
travelling we both have different opinions i contend
that it is impossible for one to even think that in the
future time travelling machines will be invented
that will transport one through time to the future
sav  years-and my wife saysthat it will be pos-
sible to do so in my opinion it makes good and in-
structive reading but it will always be a dream to
the authors my wife says it is possible tor it to be-
come a reality kindly answer this through your
readers column and give us your opinion thanking
you lor a lot of good reading and pleasant evenings

we should dislike to raise any discord in the now
happy barrie family by taking sides in the time travel-
ing question yet as a duty to science as well as
science fiction we must answer mr barrie

suppose we take ourselves back three thousand years
or more to the days of the biblical prophets and tried
to describe to them a television machine or a radio or
an electric dvnamo the people of that time might not
even have been able to conceive of what we meant
not- alone picturing the instruments we were speaking
about how then ran we with any finality picture
adequately what the scientific attainments of the future
will be we are slill but children peering ahead in
a dimly lighted world of science we see a few things
and men of rare genius see a little further than we
but who can really see five hundred a ihousand or five
thousand years ahead

the best that we of mortal minds can do is to say
to these questions i dont know to us time
travelling must first be proved a scientific possibility
then it must be proved that a machine can be built to
make use of that possibility but possible or not the
time travelling machine provides the fascinating means
of projecting ourselves into the future and seeing whal
the world will be like then it is the vehicle for our
hopes and dreams so that we can see and compare
those dreams with the reality

the more we read and learn of science and its pos
slbilities the mqre we realize that each generation can
only add an infinitesimal amount to the sum total of
available knowledge and can only visualize an infin-
tesimal amount of the great reality and we must
remain humble before the vastness lhat is cur uni

demands a higher standard

editor wonder xt okies

contrary to ihe statement that wonder stories
was to be a great improvement over the former sister
publications won oer stories is on the decline
the stories are overburdeued with slush slush and
more slush

i will eite one of my objections there are far too
many spectacular escapes from highly developed super-
ior beings of incredible intellect who if they lived up
to their remarkable advancement- and superiority would
never be so careless as to allow the nearly - always-
inexperienced - heroes-to-escape-from-them-in

-	such-simple-fashion-to-save-the-world -
from-destruction-just-at-the-zero-hour

so what i want is a higher literary standard i re-
ject stories of the dime-novel type

our magazines need more stories like the white
army by dr daniel dressier or the city of the
living dead by laurence manning and fletcher pratt
in science wonder stories cut out stores like the
hidden world by edmond ilamiltou in the fall 
quarterly just think of covering all the enemy globes
numbering so mny thousands with but one sphere i

in conclusion  wish to say i am real sorry i am
knocking your magazine so severely as all my former
letters have been full of praises and compliments is tit
i had to i ui- to demand a higher literary standard

arthur berkowitz

we are in accord with mr berkowitz with regard to
the literary standard of our stories we believe that we
have achieved a high standard which we intend to not
only maintain but constantly improve the hidden
world received a great deal of praise from our read
ers and in another column will be found a letter from
an acknowledged german authority mr willy ley
secretary of the german interplanetary society who
deems it one of the best that the quarterly has
produced

however mr berkovitz need not feel badly about hi
criticism we want it and when the point is well
taken we are glad to publish similar letters and throw
the matter open or discussion among our readers-

to promote the advancement of science

editor wonder stories

since the inception of the science correspondent
club two years ago we have had at all times the assis-
tance and sincere cooperation of the gernsback publi-
cations this organization wishes to express its sin-
cerest appreciation for the wonderful help you have ex-
tended us

the science correspondence club is an organization

primarily of persons interested in the discussion of pre-
sent day science and science fiction by correspondence
however the names of many of the most prominent
scientists of the day are inscribed on our member-
ship roll about fifteen of the authors whose stories
have appeared in it os dei stories and its pre-
decessors are members

the purposes of the club is quoting from the con-
stitution to promote the advancement of science
among laymen ot the world through the use of discus
sion and the creation of new ideas and their ex-
change- we believe that this is a good expression
ol our aim

a bulletin is published monthly containing articles
of general interest in scientific ideas a library is
now maintained of numerous scientific books and
science fiction we have every issue of the leading
magazines of this type

the year  will end with the science corres-
pondence club probably tripled in number and power
over last year persons interested in becoming mem-
bers are invited to communicate with

the progress of the science correspondence club
seems to be steady and healthy we cannot but wish

editor wonder stories

am sorry to see that  didnt express myself clear-
ly enough in my last letter but you know how it
is when one condenses a letter for publication

now let me clear us that point of the loi if one
 omcs up againm a word of doubtful meaning it is
always helpful to dig down to bedrock as to its r-ul
meaning now tripe is a very useful and necessary
component of certain animals and is neither bright
clever er brilliant but for its functions which are
all hard work and no play it deserves respect as
does every person who laks up his cross and his du-
ties and carries on just because it is the decent thing
to do

ninely per cent of mankind to this in all ranks
and walks of life but there is a  which think
they are clever and smart when they get away with
things even murder there arc people in every class
and occupation of life who think they can get
something for nothing who think they can put some-
thing over on other people who are not fundamen-
tally honest

among thoe i reckon priests who preach with their
tongues in their cheek physicians who made drug ad-
dicts to whom the bill is the most important object
real estate dealers who sell shady real estate tailors
who sell shoddy for wool auto mechanics who skimp
their work food dealers who sell putrid meat china
clay for flour and sand for sugar wives who set
their own pleasure above the weal of their family
husbands who spend their earnings on themselves
employers who sweat their employees and employees
who dont do an honest days work nnd so on have
i made myself clear now about the meaning of the
tripy  and the clever  that real in-
telligence is never clever that only linlflmked
minds are clever scintillating and smart  whoever
has had the pleasure to ineel the really great of this
world be they scientists or preachers teachers or
philosophers rulers or peasants people in ihe lime-
light or just ordinsry folk will always have found
thern humble and without any side just ordinary
hardworking tripe without any complexes

since ur hehr now makes himself clear we can
quit agree with him about ihe difference between
the ninety and the ten it in unfortunately all too
true that tho tun aro able lo gobble up the good things
of life counting upon the stupid honesty of tlie
ninety

however wo think that mr hehr makes a mistake
when he applies ihe word tripe lo the ninety
words convev their habitual meaning aud tripe
means anything unimportant or insignificant now
by his own words mr hehr admits lhat men of great
ability oiaj be humble and honest and be classed among
ihe ninety therefore these men cannot be tripe

mr darrow is right there should be a sequel to
the struggle for venus venus is too great n
prize for the martians to give her up merely becausa
they have been defeai-d once if it were not lhat
we would be anticipating what mr arnold might tell
us in a sequel we would say lhat the martians would
undoubtedly make a second voyage to determ in- how
their compatriots fared then they would invado
venus in force aud the serious part of the struggle
uould begin

however it is a question of what value the planefe
would have for us many scientists believe that the
earth will cool off when venus is still young when
the earth is in the state that mars is now venus will
probably be in the condition thal the earth is now
its value then aside from all other considerations ia
obvious

but we leave the field open for mr arnold wo
know he will give us a good btory

we have  plans for the improvement of tho
physical makeup of woxoer stories that we will
announce in our next issue meanwhile be assured
that we have ihe convenience of our readers always

the squareheads by william salis-
bury  pages paper covers size x
 published by independent publish-
ing company new rochelle n y price


mr salisbury presents us with a new type of social
satire using the familiar device of pushing his charac-
ter iuto lilt- future into a completely mechanized social-
ized slate at least the customs and the liabits of th
people have become mechanized it is a world filled
with square-headed people whose whole social out-
look is bounded by tilt square they must walk in
groups of four speak in blank verse with phrases ol
four words and in every social custom tlie number
four must be predominant to the reviewer ihe device
is an unfortunate one for once started it- must be
maintained by ihe author it quickly becomes boring

we tee ourselves of the present day exposed by tho
author in all our narrowmindedness hypocrisy and
insistence upon uniformity in our lives lo the exclu
sion of that individuality that makes for social pro
grcss

there are bootleggers in tho future as iu the present
and there are policemen who or a consideration will
wink at wrongdoings

marriage is by eugenics in this model world and our
time traveler must perforce marry a tquareheaded
beauty because her characteristics arc eugenicallv
mated to his own

as a social satire there is not much that is original
in ihe method and execution of this look but all -jeh
satires have their place-for only by moans of them
can we become aware of our follies our stupidities
and our weaknesses and in effect see ourselves as
others see us

the man who mastered time by
ray cummings  pages stiff cloth
covers size x published by a c
mcclurg and company chicago price


ray cummings as a teller of unusual stories has
one of the qualities at least of h  wells neither
of these writer of science fiction presents an unusual
situation to a reader and say here this is true i
believe it or not it really happened i instead their
method is more subtle or rather more insidioas they
do not ask for belief instead by carefully planned
hints by suggestion by little personal word pictures
by their own doubts as the reoounter of the tales
they prepare ihe reader for the startling fact that is
about to be revealed so when it comes the reader s
resistance has been removed and he finds himself
believing

that quality of cummings is nowhere more in evi

deuce than in the present volume although today
readers of science fiction are accustomed more or less
to the adventures of time travelers the firs publica-
tion of ibis story must have had to combat the pre-
judice aroused by the mere idea in it travel into
the future or past ihe average man probably grunt-
ed absurd 

yet cummings makes his story and his characters
bo human and their efforts so filled with human error
that we cannot bill admit at least that time travell-
ing might be accomplished

the young loto rogers travels  years into
the future and sees i new human race-physically
degenerate with a new savagery yet with a greater
science than we possess perhaps the strange events
of that age would have had no meaning for him but
there was a girl  so loto must return to
hib own time for help and then return to the future
to take his part in that stirring drama of hate
greed and lust to lovers of cummings this book
is warmly recommended

runner of all modern science

science fiction phis a pion-
eer in the electrical and

back has a profound
knowledge of the subjects
coupled with a finely
trained and highly imag-
inative mind this un-

enabled him to fore-
shadow with almost
unbelievable accuracy
some of the more re-
cent developments
his earlier predic-
tions which have
appeared from time
to time during the
past decade in
many newspapers

and magazines are
now realities every
prophecy is based
on accurate scienti-
fic knowledge hit
ideas are no more
fantastic than the

monplaces of our
