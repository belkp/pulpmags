how to cook low priced meats

         clever ifays to reduce table expenses
         without skimping on quality or quantity

 by mary jane mcclure

   planning seven dinners a week on a
limited market allowance is the proposition
that confronts the majority of housekeepers

   with a healthy family demanding meat
the problem will be hard to solve unless
you borrow some of the arts of our french
and german cousins and learn how to cook
the cheaper meat cuts appetizingly and
utilize every scrap

   slow cooking and skill in flavoring is
the secret with a jar of armours extract
of beef for flavoring you can satisfy an
epicure and still keep well within a slen-
der allowance

   instead of the highest priced rib roast
get a piece cut from the round for  to 
cents cook slowly in a covered dish with
a cup of water in-which a quarter of a tea-
spoonful of armours extract of beef has
been dissolved basting frequently adding
more water and extract if necessary when
nearly done lay some potatoes in the pan to
brown in the gravy then see your family
enthuse over your culinary skill

   warm up your left-over meats in a sauce
of butter and flour flavored with armours
extract of beef add it to gravy for richness
and flavor instead of going to the trouble
and expense of boiling meat for soup
stock use armours extract of beef as the
basis and be sure of results

   beef extract is the standby of foreign
cooks and americans are learning its won-
derful convenience and the improvement
it works in every meat dish

   armours extract of beef is so concen-
trated that it is very economical to learn
its innumerable uses send to armour and
company chicagofor their little cook book
called popular recipes they will
gladly send it on request keep it for
ready reference until you learn its rules
it will earn you the reputation of being
a wonderful meat cook

as a news-butcher

by frank marshall white

the life-story of the  wizard of menlo park as the great inventor
thomas alva edison is popularly called is one of the most romantic
narratives of a mans achievement that the world has ever known
starting as a news-butcher or train-bov on the grand trunk railway in the
baggage-cars of which line he made his first experiments in electricity he has
mounted the ladder of success to a point where his name will remain indelible
throughout the ages he is perhaps the most useful man that ever lived

     we give here for the first time the complete story of his life days as
a railroad employee during the moments that he was not selling newspapers
and peanuts he was teaching himself the mysteries of the telegraph which
soon directed his budding energies toward what was in those days the almost
untouched field of electricity his early days in a baggage-car were the step-
ping-stones to some of the most wonderful achievements of all time

vol xiii

edison

how the eminent inventor planned his future in one of uncle sams
mail cars and what he accomplished before an angry
conductor destroyed his plant

ft was at the age of thirteen that
thomas alva edison began his
career as a train-boy on the
grand trunk railway which
 led him by way of the tele-
graph office into the realms of
electricity where to-day in his mental and
physical prime he stands head and shoul-
ders above the giants of invention that sur-
round him every now and then bringing
forth some new and wonderful achieve--
ment of his busy hands and brain to light-

l rr	

en man s labor and make his life happier

  edisons parents at that early period of
his life were living in port huron one
of michigans great lumber centers in the
fifties and the neighbors were not a little
surprised when they learned that samuel
edison the feed and grain dealer who
lived in the colonial mansion on the gov-
ernment reservation facing the st clair
river had consented to allow his son alva
as the boy was called to sell newspapers
on the grand trunk local to detroit
s

the railroad mans magazine

  while the elder edison was not a
wealthy man he was well-to-do- for he had
made money in lumber as well as in his
other business and his hundred-foot tower
which he had constructed on the reservation
overlooking lake huron and the river to
which the railroads ran excursion trains
also added greatly to his income so that
it could not have been for the sake of money
that he allowed his son to go so far from
home every day on the long run to detroit
which was sixty-three miles away

  the fact was that samuel edison and
his wife were exceptionally wise parents
otherwise they might easily have extin-
guished the spark of genius in the boy for
he began to show a capacity for business at
an age when the minds of most children
reared under ordinary conditions would
not have risen above play wherefore it is
well for the world in which his name is
to-day a household word that edison had
the right kind of parents

owes much to parents

  edisons paternal ancestors came to this
country from holland in about the year
 samuel edison was born in nova
scotia where his father had gone after
the revolution the family subsequently
making its home in canada at a town
called vienna on the shores of lake erie
here samuel edison at the age of twenty-
four was keeping a hotel when he mar-
ried miss nancy elliott a school-teacher
and the daughter of the rev john elliott
who had been a baptist minister in the
state of new york at the time of her birth
and was a descendant of captain ebenezer
elliott a famous revolutionary soldier

  having decided political views and tak-
ing an active part in the papineau rebel-
lion of s samuel edison was compelled
to flee over the border and hence the uni-
ted states and not canada has the honor
of being the birthplace of the greatest in-
ventor of his time which is as it should be
as he comes of american stock on both
sides of his family

  edison was born in milan ohio in
 and his parents settled in port hu-
ron when he was a boy seven years of age
although he has developed into a man of
abnormal physical endurance frequently
working for twenty-four hours at a stretch
without rest or food and capable of endur-
ing all that the strongest and hardiest of

his employees can the inventor was so fra-
gile a child that it was not considered wise
to send him to school in milan in port
huron he went to the public school for only
three months which is the extent of his
experience within the walls of a school
room

his love for books

  edison had an enormous advantage over
the average boy however in that his moth-
er had not only been trained as a teacher
but was a woman of extraordinary intel-
lectual attainments and force of character
who found her highest pleasure in estab-
lishing the foundation of her sons edu-
cation his father also encouraged the lads
early fondness of reading and paid him a
small amount on the completion of the
perusal of a book

  thus before alva had reached the age
of twelve he had read gibbons  decline
and fall of the roman empire humes
history of england searss history of
the world burtons  anatomy of melan-
choly the  dictionary of sciences and
had even struggled with newtons prin-
cipia besides mastering the ordinary stud-
ies of a boy of his age he was also fond
of stories of romance and adventure and
was so devoted an admirer of victor hugo
later in life that he was known to his fel-
low telegraph operators as  victor hugo
edison

   it was in their practise of non-interfer-
ence with young edisons amusements that
his parents displayed unusual wisdom
when he was only twelve years of age his
father happened to be called in the middle
of a winters night to the part of the house
where the boy slept and was surprised to
observe light streaming through the keyhole
of his door peeping into the room he
saw alva huddled up in an overcoat with
a scarf tied over his head busy handling a
lot of bottles he had ranged on a shelf

a child experimenter

  some parents would have broken in on
the boy and ordored him to bed and per-
haps have thrown out his bottles samuel
edison did nothing of the kind nancy
edison also was more lenient than most
mothers and when her son began at the
early age of ten or eleven to conduct chemi-
cal experiments in the cellar leaving bro-
edison as a news-butcher



ken glass and evil-smelling liquids about
the floor she was not too quick to inter-
fere

  to be sure she believed in the efficacy
of a switch as some parents do even at the
present stage of civilization and she finally
made young alva confine his materials and
energies to one room in the cellar and put
a lock on the door here the small boy
established a laboratory with some two
hundred bottles in rows on the shelves all
labeled  poison  in order that they might
not be rashly dealt with and he spent his
entire fund of pocket money for chemicals
at the port huron drug store with which
he made experiments from formulas in
parkers  school philosophy

  neighbors of the edisons both in milan
and port huron were never quite able to
understand the frail-looking boy with the
unusually large though well shaped head
indeed he took so absorbing an interest in
matters and things about him from his very
earliest childhood and was consequently
so preoccupied when he was not asking
what often seemed to his elders ridiculous

questions that his intelligence was some-
times doubted

  the public school teacher at port hu-
ron reported that he was addled and dur-
ing his three months under her tuition he
was generally at the foot of his classes
though when lie was only three years of
age he was noticed in the village square of
milan attempting to copy the signs on the
stores and shops

  the arguments that young edison ad-
vanced to induce his parents to allow him
to sell newspapers on the railroad were thit
in addition to his making money for the
purchase of chemicals for his experiments
in the ceflar it would also be possible for
him to read several hours daily between
trains in the public library in detroit be-
sides being able to bring home newspapers
and magazines for the familys perusal

  his fathers objections to alvas going
into business at the age of thirteen were
more easily overcome than those of his
mother but her consent to the project was
eventually gained the boy was always
home at night the train leaving port hu-

in the unused smoking-compartment edison became editor proprietor
publisher and compositor of the weekly herald


the railroad mans magazine

peeping into the room he saw alva busily handling a
lot of bottles

ron in the morning at seven oclock and
the return train getting back at  in the
evening

  edison had not been many weeks selling
newspapers periodicals candy and other
small merchandise on the train when he
saw opportunities for profitable trading
in other directions he opened two stores
in port huron one for the sale of news-
papers and periodicals and the other for
commerce in vegetables butter and berries
in season which he brought from detroit or
purchased along the line of the railroad

a youthful employer

  he hired boys of about his own age to
take charge of his undertakings in port
huron while he was absent on his train or
in detroit

  when the grand trunk put on an ex-
press to detroit edison obtained permis-
sion to have a newsboy in his pay on the
train from whom he exacted a daily ac-
counting later an immigrant train was also
added to the traffic on the grand trunk
which generally carried from seven to ten
coaches filled with norwegians bound for

iowa and minnesota edison-
now engaged another boy to sell
bread fruit candy and tobacco
to the immigrants from which
he reaped a goodly profit

  during his first year on the
railroad the young merchant
sometimes made as much as 
or  per day from his enter-
prises and he regularly paid
his mother a dollar a day for
his board edison carried his
produce from detroit to port
huron in the mail-car of his
train

   i was never asked to pay
freight he says and to this
day cannot explain why except
that i was so small and indus-
trious and the nerve to appro-
priate a united states mail-car
to do a free freight business
was so monumental

  edisons second year as a
train-boy  was that of the
outbreak of the war of the
rebellion which made the trade
in newspapers brisk the four-
teen-year-old lad not only took
full-advantage of his opportu-
nities as a dealer but he actually started a
newspaper of his own the local train
between port huron and detroit carried
a baggage-car that was divided into three
compartments one for baggage one for the
mail and the third for smoking

  there were no facilities for ventilation
in the smoking-compartment and hence it
was not used in it edison installed a
printing press he had purchased cheap in
detroit where it had been used to print
bills of fare in a hotel procuring an out-
fit of type and learning the rudiments of
printing from the printers devil in the
office of the port huron commercial the
boy now became editor proprietor publish-
er and compositor of the weekly herald
which was mentioned by an esteemed con-
temporary the london times as the first
newspaper in the world to be printed on a
train in motion

a traveling newspaper plant

  the price of the weekly herald was
three cents per copy or two cents if taken
by the month and paid for in advance and
it achieved a circulation of four hundred
yj  

edison as a news-butcher	

copies it was not dependent for its sales
on its novelty in being the work of a small
boy on a railroad train either but it pub-
lished news that was of interest along the
line of the grand trunk road

  frequently too he weekly herald
scored a beat on its contemporaries in port
huron and detroit since with the assist-
ance of the railway telegraph edison often
obtained local and war news later than
that published in the papers he sold on the
train the profits from his newspaper
were as much as  or  per month in
addition to his receipts from his other
commercial undertakings

  the publication of the weekly herald
with the demand for papers created by
news of the war made it necessary for edi-
son to employ an assistant on the train in
addition to the other boys who were work-
ing for him no veteran in the news trade
ever rose to his opportunities with more
enterprise and greater aplomb than young
edison it may be mentioned as illustra-
tive of his attention to details that he had
arranged a jumping-off place from the
traiiv at port huron

  the train always slowed down at a point
about a quarter of a mile from the sta-
tion which was nearer his home than the
terminus and where it was therefore more
convenient for him to alight in order not
to take an unnecessary chance of injuring
himself in jumping from the moving train
he had used his fathers horse to haul sev-
eral loads of sand to the slowing-down
place and made a soft bank to alight on

how the telegraph helped

  when battles occurred during the war
edison would get the telegraph operator at
detroit to send the news along the line of
the grand trunk where he had made ar-
rangements witli the local station agents to
post bulletins summarizing events in order
that residents might be at the stations to
purchase newspapers when the train came
through operators and station-agents
were paid in newspapers and magazines
that the boy did not otherwise dispose of

  on the morning of the day that news was
received of the battle of shiloh in april
 the most terrible thus far since the

he


the railroad mans magazine

legionii of the war in which both grant
and sherman were engaged and johnston
was killed edison reached the bulletin
boards of the detroit newspapers soon after
the arrival of his train from port huron at
ten oclock he found the offices surround-
ed by horror-stricken crowds for the bul-
letins declared that  men had already
perished and that the battle was still rag-
ing with its outcome uncertain

  the boy realized that there would be an
unprecedented demand for newspapers that
day all along the grand trunk line between
detroit and port huron are more particu-
larly at the end of the road his usual
practise was to cam- a hundred papers on
his train but he estimated that he would
undoubtedly be able to sell a thousand in
view of the excitement caused by the battle

when edison raised the price

  the first thing to be done was to get out
his bulletin and to effect this he promised
the telegraph operator a weekly magazine
for three months and now a tremendous
obstacle arose he did not have enough
money to purchase a thousand papers and
he was not acquainted with any one con-
nected with their issue however he could
not let so great an opportunity slip without
at least making an attempt to take advan-
tage of it and young edison walked into
the editorial rooms of the detroit free
press whose destinies were then presided
over by no less a personage than wilbur f
storey who afterward founded the chicago
times

  to storey and one of his associates the
boy of fifteen stated his predicament ex-
plaining that he had already telegraphed
the news of the battle to all the stations
alonir the grand trunk railroad between
there and port huron and that he had only
sufficient money to purchase a hundred pa-
pers while he was sure he could sell a thou-
sand would the free press give him credit
until the following day the other man was
of the opinion that the risk was too great
but storey overruled him and edison was
given the full number of papers he asked
for

   by the aid of another boy i lugged the
papers to the train and started folding
them said edison in telling the story
 the first station called utica was a small
one where i generally sold two papers i
saw a crowd ahead on the platform and

thought it some excursion but the moment i
landed there was a rush for me then i
realized that the telegraph was a great in-
vention for i sold  papers there the
next station was mount clemens now a
watering place but then a town of about
one thousand i usually sold six to eight
papers there

   i decided that if i found a correspond-
ing crowd there the only thing to do to cor-
rect my lack of judgment in not getting
more papers was to raise the price from five
cents to ten the crowd was there and i
raised the price at port huron the popu-
lace was waiting for him at his jumping-off
place says edison  i then yelled  twen-
ty-five cents apiece gentlemen i havent
enough to go around  i sold all out and
made what to me then was an immense sum
of money

  while this extraordinary boy was thus
conducting money-making enterprises with
a degree of success perhaps unprecedented
in one so young he was devoting every spare
moment to study he had not been many
weeks on the detroit train when he began
to transfer his laboratory from the cellar at
home to the smoking compartment of the
baggage-car where he afterward established
his newspaper office as he had consider-
able leisure during the three hours run each
way he gave himself to experiments for
which freseniuss qualitative analysis
was the basis spending the greater part of
his earnings for chemicals

too much for the conductor

  when his train arrived in detroit in the
middle of the forenoon it was his practise
to go at once to the public library and he
often spent the entire day within its doors
until the return train left at about six in
the evening it was here that he adopted a
novel plan of study selecting a certain sec-
tion of the library and starting to read it
through shelf by shelf without regard to-
subject matter

  however edisons laboratory on wheels
was not destined to permanence and with
its end there came upon him an infliction
that to a man of lesser mental resources
would have been a terrible calamity oner
day a lurch of the car jarred a stick of
phosphorus from a shelf of the laboratory
in the baggage-car which falling to the
floor set the woodwork on fire while thr
badly frightened boy was attempting to
edison as a news-butcher



stamp out the flames the conductor of the
train a hot-tempered scotchman rushed in
with a pail of water with which he ex-
tinguished the fire after turning on the
lad and striking him a violent blow on the
ear	

  when the train reached mount clemens
the next stop edison and all his posses-
sions including his laboratory and his
printing plant were put out on the station

other operators i was not bothered by the
other instruments again in experiment-
ing on the telephone i had to improve the
transmitter so i could hear it this made
the telephone commercial as the nagneto-
telephone receiver of bell was too weak to
be used as a transmitter commercially

   it was the same with the phonograph
the great defect of that instrument was the
rendering of the overtones in music and the

turning on the lad and striking
him a violent blow on the ear

platform and left there since the moment
he was struck by the angry conductor edi-
son has been deaf but it is characteristic
of his philosophy that he bears no malice
toward the man who wrought him this irre-
parable injury indeed the inventor even
argues that his infirmity has been of bene-
fit to him rather than otherwise

loss of hearing no detriment

   this deafness has been of great ad-
vantage to me in various ways he tells his
friends when in a telegraph office i
could hear only the instrument directly on
the table at which i sat and unlike the

hissing consonants in speech i worked
over one year twenty hours a day sundays
and all to get the word  specie  perfectly
recorded and reproduced on the phono-
graph when this was done i knew tljat
everything else could je done which was
a fact again my nerves have been pre-
served intact broadway is as quiet to me
as a country village is to a person with
normal hearing

  although the father of the great inventor
once said that he never had any boyhood
days in the ordinary sense there seems to
have been considerable of the spontaneous
boy about edison during the period that he
was selling newspapers on the train and


the railroad mans magazine

studying and experimenting during most
of liis spare hours an incident edison
relates himself is illustrative

   after the breaking out of the war he
says there was a regiment of volunteer
soldiers quartered at fort gratiot the reser-
vation extending to the boundary line of
our house nearly every night we would
hear a call such as  corporal of the guard
no  this would be repeated from
sentry to sentry until it reached the bar-
racks when the corporal of the guard no
 would come and see what was wanted i
and the little dutch boy after returning
from the town after selling our paper-s
thought he would take a hand at military
affairs

   so one night when it was very dark
i shouted for the corporal of the guard
no  the sentry thinking that it was the
terminal sentry who shouted repeated it to
the third and so on this brought the
corporal along the half mile only to find
that he had been fooled we got him out
three nights but the third night they were
watching and caught the little dutch boy
taking him to the lock-up at the fort where
they shut him up they chased me to the
house

   i rushed for the cellar in one small
apartment there were two barrels of pota-
toes and a third one nearly empty i poured
these remnants into the other barrels sat
down and pulled the barrel over my head
bottom up the soldiers had awakened my
father and they were searching for me with
candles and lanterns the corporal was
absolutely certain i was in the cellar he
couldnt see how i could have gotten out
and wanted to know from my father if
there was any secret hiding place

   on the assurance of my father that
there was not he said it was most extraor-
dinary i was glad when they left as i
was cramped and the potatoes that had
been in the barrel were rotten and violently
offensive the next morning i was found
in bed and received a good switching on
the legs from my father the first and only
one i ever received from him although my
mother kept a switch behind the clock that
had the bark worn off my mothers ideas
and mine differed at times especially when
i got experimenting and mussed up things
the dutch boy was released the next morn-
ing

  another boyish adventure that resulted
in a black eye is recalled by edison in

connection with the visit to america of the
prince of wales afterward king ed-
ward vii

   great preparations were made for his
reception at sarni the canadian town op-
posite port huron the inventor says
 about every boy including myself went
over to see the affair the town was
draped in hags most profusely and car-
pets were laid for the prince to walk on
there were triumphal arches and a stand
was built above the general level where the
prince was to be received by the mayor
seeing all these preparations my idea of a
prince was very high but when he did
arrive i mistook the duke of newcastle fi
him the duke being a fine-looking man

   i soon saw that i was mistaken and
that the prince was a young stripling and
did not meet our expectations several of
us expressed our belief that a prince was
not much after all and said that we were
thoroughly disappointed for this one boy
was whipped and soon the canuck boys
attacked us yankee boys and we were bad-
ly licked i myself got a black eye that
has always prejudiced me against that
kind of ceremonial and folly

  it is probable that had it not been for
his experience as train-boy that brought him
into association with the telegraph edison
would have devoted his great talents and
energy to chemistry which was the first
bent of his great genius rather than elec-
tricity

  however the observant and intellectual
lad of fourteen could not witness daily the
transmission of messages along the magic
wire without determining to master the tele-
graph himself and with the assistance of
another port huron boy who was also
anxious to learn the art wires were strung
between their homes

  the first telegraph line over which edi-
son worked was made of stove-pipe wire
with bottles for insulators and trees for
poles and upon it the students practised
sending and receiving after the train-bo
came home at night

  the boy applied himself to the study
with his usual enthusiasm hiring a sub-
stitute to take hisplace for a part of the
trip on his train and devoting no less than
eighteen hours per day for four months to
the mastery of the wire before he was
sixteen years of age he was night opera-
tor at stratford junction on the grand
trunk in canada

        a cheerful analysis of the power of love
        over clothes college culture and cologne

if as the ancient adage says actions
  speak louder than words then
  jack sanderson meant volumes
  and spoke volumes when he
  landed square on the solar cir-
  cumjacence of dick kenny

   kindly cut any further attentions to
jessie jones admonished sanderson

  sanderson was foreman of the rancho
bonita big of muscle and big of deter-
mination he felt that he had a prior claim
on all the beauty in the immediate neigh-
borhood

  the gentleman to whom he put the curt
remark-dick kenny-was the head va-
quero jessie jones was the eastern
schoolmaam she had taught the district
school down at bridgeport for two seasons
now and her quiet unassuming innocent
presence had caused more trouble in the
neighborhood of that prairie town in the
short time that she had been there than
any of the dozen shootings stage hold-ups
poker fights or other phases of local ex-
citement

  when the boys heard thakan  eastern
schoolmaam  was coming to take the place
of the patient but consumptive male teach-
er who had finally succumbed to his mal-
ady they pictured in their minds a some-
what different creature than jessie jones

  they had read somewhere that the aver-
age schoolmaam is tall and angular mid-
dle-aged and unmarried spectacled and
skinny they pictured the  happy  time
that she would have in wild and woolly
bridgeport they heralded her coming
with jeer and jibe and wondered if any
man in the county would marry her

  but when jessie jones stepped off the
train when her trim little twenty-five
years landed on the bridgeport depot and

she faced the bunch of staring cowpunchers
and the three dozen children whose destiny
she was to shape more than one husky son
of the saddle felt a queer and unaccustomed
sensation in the region of his heart

  there she was i dark hair and dark
eyes the most bewitching face that beamed
with smiles and just the daintiest hands
and feet

  and her dress buck nevins said after-
ward that it looked like it was made out
of the clouds as for her hat-fluffy and
modish and full of flowers-jim lupton
said it looked as purty as a brindled
heifer in a sunflower patch which com-
ment in the mind of jack sanderson was
the  convolution of a chimpanzee

  from the day of her arrival things took
a different turn in the neighborhood of
bridgeport jack sanderson the dashing
young foreman usually as perfect in his
dress and deportment as a plainsman can
be was somewhat more perfect than usual

  buck nevins sent to st louis for a safe-
ty-razor which he dulled every day

  jim lupton hiked him out to the foot-
hills and trapped a grizzly so he could
boast of the best pair of chaps in the county

  sandy peters concluded that his  book-
larnin  had been sadly neglected in his
early youth so now-at thirty-three-he ac-
tually enrolled as a pupil

  dick kenny suddenly took a deep inter-
est in those fashion-plate young men who
appear in such swell-fitting clothes in the
advertising pages of the magazines so he
had his measure taken and sent east for
a regular college-cut creation

  when it came it was certainly the smart-
est-looking thing between the missouri
river and the nevada boundary - line
dick donned it every night and every sun-

day and he even sent to chicago for a box
of rubber collars which he wore with his
blue-and-red shirts with his top-boots
polished to a mirror his sombrero carefully
brushed and tilted over his right ear and
a wild rose adorning his lapel he was all
to the clothes and then some

  jessie jones took up her abode in bridge-
port with the family of old sam manning
who had lived there back since the seven-
ties and was considered everything from
the fount of wisdom to the court of last re-
sort he was judge and jury mayor and
moses

  he noticed with twinkling eyes how the
young bucks of the ranges one by one had
called to pay their respects to the pretty
teacher and how every one from jim lup-
ton with his grizzly chaps to buck nevins
with his safety-razor had been gently but
firmly placed in the discard

  the trouble with jims chaparejos cen-
tered in their newness in other words they
were a little too gamey jim hadnt let
them hang long enough and on the several
occasions when he called jessie couldnt
help but observe that his protestations of
love-jvere more evident to the nose than
they were to the ear-so she passed him up

  buck nevinss razor rebelled at the most
unfortunate moment it seems that buck
hadnt shaved for some time and he had
grown the finest specimen of wind-destroy-
ers in four counties not only were these
whiskers wonderful in length and thick-
ness but they were tough and wiry too
so much so indeed that when buck had
shaved just half of his face something was
wrong with the razor

  it wouldnt work somewhere in its deli-
cate mechanism there was a break for the
life of buck it wouldnt mow down an-
other hair he tampered with it oiled it
put in blade after blade and cursed it with
choice contumely and still it wouldnt cut
as the human  before and after  advertise-
ment he had no show for the little school-
teachers hand

  so the game narrowed down to a two-
handed affair with jack sanderson and
dick kenny running neck and neck jack
proffered his natural simple sturdy self and
the learning that he had gained at a mid-
dle-west university he was a glib and
fulsome talker he was the only man be-
sides old sam manning who was suffi-
ciently versed in politics literature and
cattle diseases to talk with ease and safety

  many and pleasant were the conversa-
tions that he had with jessie jones her
smith college brand of learning blended
nicely with his mississippi valley erudition
and they found much in common jack
believed that his brains would ultimately
win for him-that after some evening when
he had shown superior prowess as a pro-
vider of information jessie would listen to a
proposal and nab him on the spot

  dick on the other hand had developed
a hunch for the power of clothes over col-
lege culture regaled in his eastern  side-
boards to which he had added the glory of
a boiled shirt and a pair of patent-leather
shoes several sizes too small for him the
road to happiness lay clear and straight
before him

  whenever he met miss jones-whether
on the highway or in the manning parlor-
he would begin on the advantage of knowing
how to dress and the change that was sure
to come in the cowboy and his clothes

  finally this subject began to cloy on the
little schoolmaam it was evident to dick
before many moons had passed that he was
running behind sanderso instead of for-
ging ahead jessie was surely losing in-
terest in him while sanderson was calling
early and staying late

  one night he did the ungentlemanly thing
of following sanderson surreptitiously to the
manning door when sanderson entered
it was about eight oclock when he took his
departure it was alihost midnight

  dick had not gone out of eye-sight of the
front door and he was convinced

  sanderson must have something to talk
about thought dick for when he dick
called at eight he found that he could not
muster up sufficient conversation to keep
the evening from dragging at nine oclock
he was generally readv to say good night-
and so was jessie beyond all peradven-
ture he was losing

  he resolved that lie would get a book
read it and then discuss it with miss jones
but where would he get a book what
book was worth reading should he send
east for one who would lie send to
and how would he know if he were securing
the latest novel or a treatise on hares and
their habits if lie did send for one

  these questions perplexed his mind and
made him forget his clothes

  ah he had an idea he would ask
miss jones she had books andjshc could
lend him one		-
dick kennys glad rags



  here is kiplings plain tales from
the hills she said a few nights later as
she went to the little book-case in response
to his request

  gee i like them frontier stories said
dick as he took the volume

  but the east indian masterpieces of the
englishman were a bit too much for the
cowboy it is painful to say so but dick
kenny had never been much of a reader
and when it came to kipling lie was plainly
stumped but he had to make good

  bing another idea

  he would go to miss jones confess his
inability to understand kipling-and ask
her to read the stories to him they would
discuss them as they went along and per-
haps it would be necessary for him to stay
until midnight and after

  jessie was willing why shouldnt she
the district teacher be willing to help any
one who was trying to improve his mind
so for several nights she read and ex-
plained and analyzed and her sweet voice
and ready intelligence were as a great light
to the beau brummel of bridgeport

  he was a changed man literature after
all was his bent he would read or bust
he became unusually satisfied with himself
he was not so bilious a bibelot as he looked
and he named his new pony  kip

  the literary nights kept up in a short
time he had jack sanderson on the hip

  sanderson heard of it and he didnt quite
like it he surmised that jessie was taking
more interest in kenny than was good for
the sanderson chances it was time that
he took a hand in the matter he must put
a stop to any further manifestation of ken-
nys culture

  that is why after one thing had led to
another and one epithet had brought forth
a succession of abuses sanderson landed on
kenny and remarked

  kindly cut any further attentions to
jessie jones

  when sanderson delivered this ultima-
tum he and kenny were just outside the big
horse-barn of the rancho bonita kenny
with two other vaqueros and four collies
had made a rodeo of five hundred fat steers
for shipment to chicago and kenny had
just put up kip and was about to regale
himself in his store-clothes when sander-
son accosted-him

  the blow was a surprise to kenny he
didnt think that sanderson meant business
quite so thoroughly it was evident that

the foreman felt keenly that the head va-
quero was becoming more to miss jones
than a clothes-horse

  kenny went to the ground sanderson
with clenched fists stood over him ready
to strike again kenny rose to his feet

  so thats the way you feel about it
he said

  thats the way replied sanderson
 and thats the way ill continue to feel
about it dont forget

   ill get even with you yet said kenny
 and if you have no objection ill quit
this job now

   ive no objection you saved me the
trouble of firing you sanderson replied

  he couldnt but feel that the loss of his
head vaquero was something to be deplored
however for dick kenny was far and away
the best man on a horse within a mighty
radius and he could have a job on any
ranch for the mere asking

  kenny turned and walked to the ranch-
house packing his precious apparel in a
carpet-bag he returned to the stable for
kip the pony was his own property
and he needed him he mounted hung
the carpet-bag on the horn of his saddle
md rode into bridgeport kip was
lodged in a stable and his master engaged
a temporary room over skin mealeys drink-
ing and dancing emporium

  ill give that dub the ha ha he ex-
claimed aloud as he sat on the edge of his
bed broom in hand putting his glad rags
in shape for the night  if he thinks that
he can put it over this gent and get next to
that gal-hes got another think cornin

  the broom stopped its whisking the
clothes lay limp on his lap dick kenny
was looking straight ahead

  bing another idea

  ah ha he exclaimed as he arose
 i have it ill go to her to-night and ask
her to elope shell do it shell do it
shell do it he added with a smile of
assurance

   ill get fixed up in my very best and
to add to the spell ill go over to mcnultys
and get me a hair-cut jessie jones is go-
ing to be mrs dick kenny or ill be shot
full o holes

  with this say-so out of his thought dome
dick hustled over to mcnultys intending
to get shorn of his locks first then he
would return to mealys talk with the boys
for a spell sit in a game or two and then-
a bath his new clothes and her


the railroad mans magazine

  he was pleased with himself so pleased
indeed that he stopped at the general store
and purchased two kinds of st louis per-
fume one bore the euphonious name of
 yangipangi and the other was branded
pride of the dell

  he applied both at once the yangi-
pangi  would be just the thing for his
red bandanna and as for  pride of the
dell he would rub that on his hair and his
hands and a few drops sprinkled here and
there on his clothes and jessie jones would
annex him quicker than a hungry sea-bass
gobbles a fly

  about seven oclock his toilet was com-
plete what remained of the two bottles of
cologne wouldnt have perfumed a fly dick
had all but bathed in it the twilight was
just touching the dimness of night when he
sauntered forth in the direction of the man-
ning mansion it was a little early for a
caller to put in an appearance perhaps but
this was the night of all nights he would
be the early bird to catch the young lady

  as he sauntered along the highway to the
object of his young love his spirits were
gay and his heart outstripped his fleeting
footsteps that he looked pretty good he
was certain that he smelled better he was
positive

  he noticed however that every person
who passed him detected the perfumes and
several made some idle remarks accompa-
nied by a rather loud  phew 

  jessie had not finished her dinner he
would wait

  he took a chair in the parlor he did
not anticipate waiting so long but he sur-
mised the folks had just sat down to the
evening meal when he arrived presently
he began to notice that the parlor was some-
what stuffy the scent was a trifle nausea-
ting maybe it would be best to open a
window in deference to his host he could
not perform so impolite an act

  he arose and walked briskly and quietly
to and fro hoping that the odor might di-
minish a little but the action only seemed
to stir it up to greater density he was
deeply chagrined and surprised when the
mayors youngest daughter appeared at the
parlor door with her handkerchief to her
nose and dosed it then he did open the
window

  just as he was beginning to realize that
he had made a fatal mistake in getting the
jk-rfurnes the door opened and jessie ap-
peared

  dick she said it is good of you to
come so early

  there was a peculiar smile on her face
that he didnt quite like it gave him an
uneasy feeling she was onto him

   jessie i came early because i have an
important matter on me mind he said
straight from the shoulder

   indeed replied the little lady she
smiled and then fairly burst into laughter
which smote dick kenny to the heart it
wasnt the laughter of great gladness over
his early arrival and devotion it was the
laughter of one who was amused at the an-
tics of an unconscious fool

  she checked herself and then said
perhaps you want to take up another
volume of kipling or discuss the one we
have just read  

   i want to read every book in this vorld
with you said dick fervor was written
on his brow determination was in his heart

   it would take a long time to do that
jessie answered

   jessie  he stepped closer to her the
perfume instead of exerting the hypnotic
influence he had anticipated acted as a re-
pellent jessie stepped back

  jessie he said again dont go
away from me 

  before she was aware he caught her
forcibly in his arms and held her close to
his perfumed breast she tried to struggle
free but she was as a baby in the grip of a
giant

  jessie he said putting his face close
to hers  i love you i love you  love
you better than any man on the grange i
want you to elope with me to-night 

  the perfume and the sudden proposal
were too much for the girl she fainted

  she fainted dead away in his arms he
had paused a moment for a reply and he
noticed that her body was limp he tried
to raise her head but she was ghastly white
her head fell back on his arm heavens
but she was beautiful if he hadnt been
half scared to death he would have kissed
her instead he carried her to the sofa and
gently laid her down

  jessie he cried jessie i didnt
mean-jessie jessie

  he rubbed her hands and stroked her
forehead he spoke her name again and
again she dichikit move

  fright had him in its grasp he looked
around a chill ran down his spine cold
sweat dotted his face suppose some one
dick kennys glad rags



should enter the room and find him in that
awful predicament

   he rushed to the door and flung it open

  judge judge he yelled come
quick jessie has fainted 

  old man manning was enjoying a pipe
and a final cup of coffee dicks startled
cries brought him to his feet he dashed
into the parlor jessie was coming to her
face twitched her eyes opened her hands
moved the judge was at her side and
dick remembering that water was a neces-
sary adjunct to a fainting-spell despatched
one of the manning children for a buck-
etful

  the two men brought jessie around she
sat up and smiled dick started to apolo-
gize

  say roared the judge interrupting
him i dont wonder that she fainted
where on earth did you get that extract of
sewer youve got on you when you came
into the house to-night i thought youd
stepped on a skunk now for the love of
mike go home and get fumigated the
next time you come to this house with that
bunch of smell on you bring ail odorless
excavator 

  its only cologne said dick so tim-
idly that one might have taken him for a
little child

  cologne roared the judge its
worse than a tannery in the middle of sum-
mer gee whiz the night that jim lup-
ton came here with those fresh-killed chaps
was nothing compared to this 

  he rushed to the windows and opened
them all wide jessie by this time had so
fully recovered that she was able to talk
but not without the rapid accompaniment of
a fan to keep the atmosphere in motion

  what were you saying to me when i
fainted dick she asked

   i forget now replied the unhappy
cowman  im sorry that-that i came to-
night turning to the judge he added
 i guess youre right about the cologne
judge ill go home and have it taken out

  he took his hat and bowed a sad good
night his heart was heavy as he made
his way slowly along the road he grew so
angry with himself that he stopped under a
tree to commune

   of all the prime-fed jonahs youre
it he said tapping his chest

  some cowmen returning home from skin
mealeys passed him as he stood there he
noticed that they sniffed the air disdain-

fully as they passed and several uttered a
very significant whew

  the next man who says that is going
to get a wallop said dick to himself as
he clenched his fist  so help me bob
the very next guy who remarks about this
perfume-ill land on him good and
plenty 

  he wandered down to skin mealeys
the bar was in full swing the faro-
tables were crowded and the poker-games
and three-card layouts were in full blast
two days previous was pay-day on the
range and many of the boys had come in
to have a time

  dick stepped up to the bar after his
dire failure to win jessie jones he needed
a bracer and he gave the man behind the
bar the signal for red liquor

  the bottle and a glass were passed to
him he filled the glass to the brim

   want a bath   asked the bartender as
he grabbed the bottle  perhaps you
would like me hand you out a piece of soap
and a towel

  dick was just prquaring to hand back
a bit of sass himself when loud and long
and lingering came that fatal exclamation
of disgust

  w-h-e-w

  dick brushed the glass aside stepping
to the middle of the room he said so loud
that all could hear

  who said that

  calmly he began to peel off his store
coat and vest and roll up his sleeves he
threw the garments on a chair his six-
gun gleamed bright in his hip-pocket and
as a sign that he wanted to fight with his
fists only he laid it on the bar

  who said that he repeated

  jack sanderson rose from one of the
tables

  the two men glared

  what do you want to know for  asked
sanderson

  because im going to punch the man
who said it did you  

  perhaps i did and perhaps i didnt
said sanderson

    if you say you didnt youre a liar 

  dick had to punch some one that night
and he would rather punch jack sanderson-
than any other man in the world

  liar was the one word in that part
of the country that could not pass unno-
ticed under any other condition sander-
son would have been justified in drawing


the railroad mans magazine

his gun but as he had seen kenny disarm
himself it had to be a matter of fists

  sanderson stepped in front of kenny

  did you mean that he asked

  yes and i say it again

  kennv was sure of the first blow this
time he wasnt to be caught off his guard
he landed clean on sandersons jaw

  it was a pretty fight while it lasted
kenny was so very angry that his strength
was greatly augmented he drew the first
blood in short he pummeled the big one
so vigorously that sanderson feared his
reputation was at stake

  once or twice sanderson landed hard
on the vaqueros face-so hard indeed
that he thought kenny would go down for
the count but kenny was in the mood for
punishment so long as he could give it in
return the men clenched and he man-
aged to get sandersons head under his arm

  sanderson in this position could only
administer a few light blows but sander-
sons face was just where kenny could use
it as a punching-bag for his right fist he
swung on the foreman eight or ten times
unmercifully then he grabbed him by both
shoulders and flung him back into the
crowd

  several men supported sanderson it
was plain that he was not the victor an-
ger was mirrored in his bleeding face he
clenched his fists and wanted to make for
kenny again but his friends held him

  kenny was breathing hard but the smile
of the winner played around his lips go-
ing close to his antagonist he said

   i just want to ask you one question
mister sanderson do i have to cut my
attentions to jessie jones

  there was a tremendous silence every
man in the place knew now the real cause
of the fight

  sanderson couldnt speak a mighty
chagrin overpowered him no longer was
he the hero of the range in the eyes of the
very men who had regarded him as the
invincible of the invincibles he had gone
down to a defeat that was as disgusting as
it was disgraceful

  if he said yes he would prove him-
self the most hated thing of the plains-a
coward if he said no then kenny
would beat him until he begged for quarter

  there was no more battle in him he
wished that it had been gun-play and he
had been killed

  dick kenny repeated the question he

was standing over the beaten man who
hung his head and answered not

  well you big stiff said kenny for
he was willing to add insult to injury ill
speak to her whenever i want to and just
as often as i please and im going over to
where she lives early in the morning and ask
her to marry me

   i think she likes me a whole lot better
than she likes you and i think that when
she sees your face shell pass you up for a
cheap dub who can only hit a man when he
isnt looking

  cut it out kenny said mealey

  kenny picked up his coat and vest and
put his six-gun in his pocket

  ill treat every man in the room-ex-
cept one he remarked looking squarely at
sanderson as he spoke the two last words

  he threw two shining twenties on the
bar  set em up skin-and keep the
change he said

  skin mealey was too good a business
man to let any money slip by with the
help of his bartender he began to fill the
orders every man present save one or
two accepted the vaqueros invitation and
those acted as an escort to jack sanderson
who stepped out and vanished in the night

  dick kenny went to his room he went
to bed and tired from the strenuous night
he fell asleep when the first bird twit-
tered he awoke instead of donning the
famous store-suit the boiled shirt and other
fashionable trimmings he dressed himself
in his cowboy outfit and felt more natural
and more at peace with himself

  rolling the store-suit and the two empty
bottles that had contained the troublesome
cologne in a tight bundle he took them
down-stairs

   here he said to one of mealeys help
passing him a silver dollar  take these
and bury them and be sure you bury
them for if i ever see them on any human
being therell be trouble

  he breakfasted and bided his time until
he could go to jessie

  judge manning greeted him heartily

  well judge he said ive discarded
them clothes and them perfumes and ive
got some sense

  the judge smiled in approval

  is miss jones in asked kenny

  no replied the judge  it seems that
jack sanderson got in a mix-up down at
mealeys last night and got the worst of it
shes gone up to his house to nurse him
 fellow-citizens called out jim to the gang with
oratorical effect this heres furgeson

no  - the wily politician may think that he carries the railroad

vote in his vest pocket but the railroad man isnt
quite so foolish as some people imagine

he  ides of november  have
come and gone that has

certain ominous ring of
portending disaster dur-
ing carnival week in rome

 beware the ides of march as at in or
around that portentous date  he would get
his next to the  ides of march  we are
forewarned of the  ides of november

the political orators do this they do it
with great gusto and acclaim

  have they not been going about the pub-
lic places for the previous two months up-
lifting their voice and imploring the people
to beware the ides of november

  there isnt any period fraught with such
dire calamity according to the politician
as the  ides of november because about
that time the people vote him out and the
other fellow in the country goes k-smash

or is saved-depends on how you look
at it

  then close on the heels of the  ides of
november is thanksgiving day with its
savory suggestion of roast turkey oyster
dressing and cranberry auce

  the entire wage of one full round trip
may be required to purchase the turkey
hen and the frugal wife at the last hour
may substitute  hamburg but that
need not prevent us in the conversational
fulness of the day from telling how ten
or twenty years ago a big bronze full-
chested turkey was worth only one dollar

  but the round trip brings five dollars
now and years ago it only brought half as
much eggs were ten cents a dozer but
the ten-cent crop wasnt good

  whats the cause of all of it

  why of course it is the dingbat bill
or the allrich-pain bill or ballinger or
high-jinks or doc cook and if you dont
know you deserve to be in ignorance if
you had lent a dutiful ear to the campaign
eloquence of the past two months you would
have learned all about it just how it hap-
pened and the rest that is coming to us
if you failed to vote for jacob furgeson
for that seven-thousand-dollar job at wash-
ington where as  champeen of the peepul
he could throttle the octopod-you deserve
to pay a dollar a dozen for eggs

  we had a chance to vote for jake

  take called at our office and was intro-
duced to all the boys

  it did his soul good to meet railroad men
at one time he thought he would become a
railroader he thought of taking a job
firing but some trivial incident-couldnt
just remember -what-came up and he did
not get on but his brothers wife has a
cousin in iowa running an engine and that
makes him feel related to railroaders

  it does not take much of a thread for a
politician to find a sympathetic tie

  jacob was introduced all around-to
mr cash mr rate mr check and the
rest of the office force

  he clasped every man by the hand with
a hate-to-let-go touch he needed votes

  i always think said jacob in soft
purring tones that felt their way  that
office work is nice clean healthy work
when there are not too many hours mind
you on that point i have decided views
i dont believe any man should be com-
pelled to bend over a desk more than eight
hours a day

   eight hours is enough eight hours
for work eight hours for play and eight
hours for sleep thats my religion when
i get to congress i expect to advocate any
measure that will make eight hours a legal
work-day i have great respect for the office
men of a railroad its like a bank-
everythings got to be to the very cent it
takes ability to run these places

   i have a cousin gentlemen whose hus-
band is cashier for the upland road at
crisscross maybe -you have met him
havent he dont get away very much
-hes kept very close his work worries
him a good deal he often has to go back
after night and make his books balance
he complains the road dont furnish help
enough thats another point i dont
believe in railroads overworking their men
this isnt russia

    if i get to congress i want to call atten-
tion to these things unless there is some
one to stand up and bawl them out the big
corporations will go to any length to make
dividends im mighty glad to meet you
mr cash and mr rate and mr check
heres one of my cards if theres anything
special i can do for you boys when i get to
washington i want you to let me know

i	will see you again before the election
dont forget me i am mighty glad to meet
all of you good-by

  jacob cast his eyes over the office and
backed out with a few lingering nods and
ingratiating chuckles

  hes a mighty nice man aint he
said rate

  is lie asked check doubtfully
nothing to it said cash hes got
his little speil but you can send him to
congress a thousand years rate and he
wont get you out of bondage youll still
have to work for a living you too
check you fellows are not so down-trod-
den either so dont listen to all you hear
neither of you put in over six hours a day
real work as it is dont depend too much
on furgeson

   well bill bryan-

  cut it out check dont you see that
drayman waiting for you to list them house-
hold goods  

  theodore russevelt and john mitchell
are-

  got all them shipping orders ready for
the bill clerk rate better get to it youll
hold him over eight hours

  you heard about jumbo the miner
observations of a country station-agent



over at fungus didnt you why hes
going to stand up three rounds before john-
son next friday night at the rink

  where did you see that  

  its in the paper this morning

 tell us about it

 and the drayman waited a little longer
 furgeson the politician and candidate
 suave and sympathetic started down the
 track with his railroad cicerone

the sixteen-hour law and the patent-coupier
law and the extra-brakeman law our
party passed all of em

   how about the employers liability law
you fellows turned that one down put in
one of the crew

   only temporary i assure you we had
powerful opposition on that special in-
terests were arrayed with all their cunning
and resources-

jmoemak lmnd

   but they tell me you voted against it
interposed the troublesome member

  me why yes in the form in which
they brought it up i did but you should
read my speech delivered on the floors of
congress let me have your name write
it down ill mail you my speech read
it through i exposed the corporations
what did they do they emasculated the
bill until it was meaningless

   but our officers were satisfied-

  they didnt know they were gold-
bricked read my speech i voted to put
it away temporarily until railroad men had
a chance to learn the truth and until the
measure could be brought in again with
its objectionable features eliminated i am
for the man who works but i would not
stand by and see him duped by a counter-
feit measure read my speech it tells
why i voted against it 

the candidate plied
an industrious
pencil

   they ran across the switch-crew doing
 the yard work furgeson was introduced
 all around and hung on to the coal-be-
 smeared hands with a clinging fellow feel-
 ing

    im mighty glad to meet you boys
 he said  i have the greatest regard and
 admiration for railroad trainmen i had it
 in mind to go firing myself when i was a
 -young fellow i suppose i would be run-
 ning an engine now instead of being in
 politics if i hadnt got into a law office in-
 stead my folks kicked on me going onto
 the railroad my wife has a cousin in iowa
 running an engine so i feel at home with
 railroad men if i get to congress i expect
 to keep the railroad men in mind if theres
 anything i can do for them i am at their
 service the brave men who sacrifice their
 lives in the transportation service of the
 country need every consideration heres

   and grass seeds-kentucky blue and
turkestan alfalfa and bokhara clover 

   i dont know just how much i can secure
for you but you may depend on me good-
by boys

  and look into the ornamental vines and
shrubs for me continued reyburn holding
on and following the candidate away  my
wifes interested in flowers whats the
government doing in foliage and bloom
do you know you dont-thats strange
good-by boys a parting wave of
the hand and he escaped

  say reyburn said the engineer you
dont think a statesman cares anything for
carrots and johnny-jumps-ups do you

   i dont know what you mean by states-
man replied reyburn but that fellow
cant do me any good unless he helps along
the truck-patch some railroaders like to
hear the brave-men-of-the-rail spiel them
fellows give nothing to it soil and seed
is the only question before the american
people to-day-

  by george reyburn exclaimed the
engineer with a sudden start you forgot
something do you know you didnt order
any pepper-pod seed  

   ill write him get a hold of them three
gondolas and the two cars of billets in the
team track-

  and candidate furgeson passed out of
mind

  candidate furgeson was next presented
to crossing-watchman lightfoot at main
street

  mighty glad to meet you he exclaimed
breezily pumping the white-flag hand of
the watchman vigorously  i am always
delighted to meet railroad men no matter
where they are located or what they do i
have a cousin in iowa who is an engineer
i came pretty near being a railroader myself

i feel very close to railroad men there is
something fascinating about railroad work
that holds men dont matter what kind
of a job they have men dont often get
away from it been here long mr light-
foot  

   about twenty years watchin this
crossin bill bryans special has passed
over tiiis crossin thirteen times russefelts
been through here three times he smashed
his hat over the railing and spilt a lot of
words right where youre standing now bill
taft went over here two years ago and lit
up tiiese surroundins with one of them
smiles of his this is your first trip on
the crossing i cant recollect that i ever
heard of you before

   i represent this district in congress
and i want to go again i want your
help-

   dont make a durned bit of difference to
me whos there i got to put in them twelve
hours just the same but whenever them
politic fellers comes on this crossin i write
it down on the wall of my shanty what
did you say your name was furgeson
never heard of you before but ill put it on
the wall envway ill risk it-

  this was all the candidate got out of the
crossing watchman but he had the satis-
faction of knowing that he stood on an
historic spot and that his cognomen was
inscribed under the names of the most illus-
trious of our land on the wall of the cross-
ing-watchmans shanty

  they next took furgeson down the track
a mile or such a matter to visit jim obrien
and his section gang of six men all voterc

   i am glad to meet you mr obrien
said furgeson and i am glad to shake
the hands of these men i am always glad
to meet railroad men my wifes cousin is
a railroader in iowa i came near being one
when i was a young man so i have a friend-
ly feeling for them i feel that i am one of
them and whenever i can do anything
for them i am glad to do it

  jim obrien traces his ancestry back to
the fighting stock of connaught so he
stood up before candidate furgeson un-
afraid and unawed

 fellow-citizens called out jim to the
gang with oratorical effect  this heres
furgeson hes running for president-
for congress corrected furgeson
furgesons an irishman continued
obrien undaunted

   scotch-irish interposed furgeson


the railroad mans magazine

  hang the difference in this country-
were all wan anyhow obrien contin-
ued has furgeson iver done anything
for me no has furgeson iver done any-
thing for you tim hogan speak it out
dont be afraid he has not you say has
fifrgeson iver helped any of the rest of
you  

  jim raised an inquiring hand and paused
while from behind the barricade of picks
shovels crowbars and tampers there came an
unanimous negative

  we dont care whos elected persisted
jim what we want to know furgeson
is bacon and spuds coming down or be they
goin up higher

   thats the issue furgeson can a man
on wan-sixty a day and six children and not
a cent more in sight-but more little wans
maybe-can he live furgeson i put it to
you and will you jump on to the bacon
trust and the spud trust if we elect you
to the council will you give em belix
furgeson can we depend on you 

  now furgeson returned some soothing
and propitiating words touching the gold
output die tariff the trust and the pauper
labor of europe

  obrien remained belligerent and uncon-
vinced but he took a new turn

   will you do us a little favor furgeson
he asked  to show us you mean well  will
you take that watercan and go over to that
farmhouse beyant the hill and bring us a
can of water this is a hot day and these
men be sufferin from thirst you can see
that yourself wouldnt a kind act like that
to these hard-workin men put you in well
with them wouldnt it now furgeson 

  furgeson without a word picked up the
empty can and marched off as if the order
had come direct from uncle joseph cannon
himself

  he found the farmhouse  beyant  the
hill-quite a way heyant in fact-but
he got the water two gallons of it and he
lugged it back

  they drank a hilarious but non-committal
toast to  prisident furgeson

   then they moved a pile of ties

  obrien and hogan put a stick under the
end of a heavy tie and they called to furge-
son for the other end

   furgesons eyes bulged the veins of his
neck stood out and the sweat poured down
his face-but he made the trip five times

  well take you to town furgeson said
obrien cheerfully well take you in on

the hand-cyar put on the cyar men stand
right there furgeson git a tight holt on the
handle-bar-and pump furgeson

  obrien may have pumped and the gang
may have lent aid-there are doubts-but
furgeson went down with all his weight and
up with all his might laboring like a galley
slave on a rolling sea and the  cyar  mere-
ly crawled along

  obrien gave vent to the surging political
emotions that were within him in a loud and
challenging voice but furgeson could only
answer in guttural monosyllables he
hadnt the wind

  he dropped off at the station in a state of
limp he was panting like a one-cylinder
motor

   good-by furgeson called out obrien
 if you had to keep that up tin hours a day
and every day of your life for wan dollar
and sixty-two cents a day youd know what
it is bein a laborin man on a railroad
come hogan heave to and bear down-

   how much do that job of congress
pay asked hogan

   seven thousand a year answered
obrien

   how much does roadmaster sullivan
git

  a little over a thousand

  a little over a thousand and furgeson
siven thousand sullivan can pump a cyar
tin miles and niver pant did you hear
furgeson only one mile too hes a
weaklin jimmie what are we votin for
the likes o him theres tid russ ofelt
dyou think hed be out of breath from
luggin a can of water and a few ties and
pumpin the cyar wan mile dyou think
that little mild exercise would interfere with
his line of talk tiddys a great states-
man  

  furgeson having run hot it is the duty of
this narrative to set him out until lie
can be repacked and perhaps a new brass
put in

  this gives us the opportunity to inject a
few words respecting politics and the rail-
road man

  there are more than one and a half mil-
lions of us scattered throughout the fair
domain and no congressman or constable
can run without giving a goodly number of
us an opportunity to lend support or land
on him as the case may require

  swelling a little with pride i want to
put it down that we are a potent force-
only we dont pote
observations of a country st ati on - agen t

-

  a great railroad president of a western
line alarmed at the growing hostility
against railroads on every hand was in-
terviewed recently and his observations
were widely copied



a great political army of more than a
million and a half railroad men massed in
one unit and for the single purpose of self-
preservation is not reckoning with that ele-
mental quality of human nature which

but he made the trip five times

  he appealed to railroad workers every-
where to go into politics to ascertain the
attitude toward railroads of every man who
runs for office and to  half-nelson 
wherever there wtfs a hostile hint regard-
less of party attachments

  we would become a force to be feared
and favored by the politicians and the
scourge of prosecution now directed against
the railroads would come to an end

  but railroad men divide they always
have and they always will in every man
there is a certain hereditary taint of party
loyalty it outlasts his religion it directs
his ballot with a certain automatic blind-
ness and a get-together appeal is futile
against it

  there isnt much of the oriental subser-
viency in the free-born american he is
here to complain criticize and object he
cant be gotten together on any proposition
even if it is for his own material gain

  the railroad president who dreams of

would overturn the pillars even if the
house tumbled down upon his head

  if he must moralize it should be in this
way if every tree that grows were a hard
maple there would be maple molasses
enough for every man woman and child for
pancakes three times a day the year round

  there is a certain saccharine pleasant-
ness to that sort of philosophy it is within
the same plane of probability as if one
would say  if all railroad men would get
together politically etc etc

  here and there at terminals or wherever
railroad men are stationed in large num-
bers we find some trainman foreman boss
or office man who carries the railroad vote
around in his pocket

  he is to the front in every campaign he
attends the caucuses and the secret meetings
and he speaks for the railroad men

  he tells what they want and what they
must have and just what they will do if
they dont get it


the railroad mans magazine

  nobody appoints him a bell - wether
he kindly takes on that function of his
own accord -and in this little play of his
own prejudges likes and dislikes he fools
and flatters himself that he has a following

  i knew a conductor at one time named
benson bensons koran was the party
platform the book of rules was only an

to drink their fill at the party trough by

benson

benson was patted on the back and told
that by and by his time would come when
his party would reward his vigilance and
activity in keeping the railroad men in line

at length benson ran for sheriff of the
county he announced himself as the rail-

annoying incident of his daily life but
what his party said about the tariff con-
serving the resources or foreign relations
was vital to benson

  benson attended all the conventions he
could he had the politicians and the can-
didates coming to him for the inside in-
formation of how the railroad men would
vote and how they felt toward the party

  benson always pictured them muttering
mutiny to be seen and reasoned with only
by benson and led back to the straight and
narrow way only by henson and to be made

road mans candidate he let it be known
that if he was defeated in the convention
not one of the thousand railroad votes would
be cast for the party they demanded this
timely recognition of one of their number
and if denied he could not prevent the party
from the catastrophe of overwhelming de-
feat at the hands of the offended rail-
roaders

  after lining and delivering the railroad
vote for years benson thought there would
not be a dissenting voice on the count
there were six candidates and the conven-

obrien may have pumped

and the gang may have
lent aid - there
are doubts

observations of a country station-agent



tion deliberately chose a tassel-whiskered
hog-raiser from way back in mudrun
township benson stood number six on
the list he swallowed his disappointment
and stood up and moved that the nomina-
tion of the hog-farmer of mudrun be made
unanimous and that there need be no fear
of the railroad vote he-benson-would
attend to that

  bensons railroad work was faulty and
after a series of blunders the superintendent
let him out benson laid his discharge to
far-reaching and powerful political forces
bent upon destroying his influence

  from that day benson had all his time
for his country the bosses used him for
all the little jobs around headquarters where
a handy man is needed he hung around
the court-house for odd jobs as a bailiff or
as a convenient juror he grew seedy and
subservient but with all this he never re-
linquished his hold on the railroad vote
finally getting to the place where he would
sell it in a lump lot to anyone needing it
for anything from one dollar up

  i saw benson last week at his voting
place he looked flayed and fallen he
held a poll-book in a rather shaky hand
the sunset tip was on his nose and there
was corn and malt on his breath he was
working for the party

  he plucked me aside put his mouth
close to my ear and shielded his voice with

his hand so the weight of his words would
not carry to hostile ears

   furgesons goin to be elected in a can-
ter ive got the railroad men lined up for
him solid furgesons our next congress-
man

  there was triumph in his watery eyes
he held me a minute-longer and his voice
went to a whisper

   say have you a dollar you can let me
have ill give it back to you next week

  i gave him a verbal order on furgeson
but it was never cashed for furgeson got
his  on that eventful day

  furgeson-the man whose wife had a
cousin railroading in iowa who exuded
sympathy and fellow-feeling for railroaders
at every pore who leaned on benson for
the railroad vote-was numbered among the
also ran

  so you mr railroad president and you
mr candidate and you mr politician-
the railroad vote cannot be controlled and
cannot be delivered no matter how im-
minent the danger or how worthy the cause
it is the law of human nature to question
and dissent and railroaders are largely
human

  there is one thing we have to be thankful
for as we carve the turkey the pot-roast
or the liver if we were not unyielding
self-sufficient even pig-headed we would
not be where we are to-day

 killed train robber with a stone

engineer foiled hold-up on colorado midland by braining outlaw armed

with a rifle

engineer frank stewart of the

 colorado midland railroad has proved
himself the sort of man that train-robbers will do
well to let alone in the future armed only with
a rock which he had picked up from the road-
bed this plucky hogger gave battle to a bandit
carrying two  colts who with several com-
panions was attempting to hold up his train at
a siding near colorado springs recently and felled
the outlaw with a blow on the head that almost
instantly brought about his death frightened by
the fate of their pal the other robbers fled es-
caping into the hills where they were sought for
days by a sheriffs posse

  the hold-up occurred as the train was making
a siding to allow the passage of a train from the
west

  the first intimation of the attempted robbery
came when engineer stewart and fireman paul
bochrifen were ordered to stop the train and
alight from the cab of the engine both men did
as ordered but bochman attempted to escape by
lodging under the baggage-car as he did so the
bandit stooped to shoot him when stewart picked
up a rock and hit the man a death-dealing blow
on the head

  as the bandit fell forward he fired at stewart
the bullet hit the engineer in the left thigh in-
flicting a painful wound but that ended the fight
for the desperado died a moment later

  the scene of the hold-up is one of the wildest in
the rocky mountains the country is sparsely
settled and it offers an ideal opportunity for es-
cape into the hills-an francisco chronicle

by j edward hungerford

   written for the railroad mans magazine

e have sung in ardent phrases of the gallant engine-
crew

and weve hymned the brave conductor from most every
point of view

we have praised the superintendent and the man who lays the track
and weve hung the laurels thickly on our worthy friend the  shack
we have lauded up the ticket-man the man behind the claim-

we have bragged about the section-man and others i might name

but theres one deserving fellow that weve skipped without intent-

hes the man who runs the railroad boys our friend the president

weve had visions of him lolling in his private palace-car

and weve viewed him through the smoke-wreaths of his fifty-cent cigar
oh his job looks soft and easy from a certain point of view

but hes got his troubles pardner just the same as me and you

for he has to boss the railroad and he has to make it grow

and his brain is always workin like a whizzin dynamo

and his path is often rocky and a mighty steep ascent

but he packs his burden gladly does our friend the president

theres a hundred pressing matters up before him every day

and hes got to solve em quickly in a diplomatic way

hes a thousand things to think of and a thousand things to do

and hes always on the fightin line-his cry is  put it through 

oh hes sure a workin wonder with a genius for his job

and hes felt the pulse of traffic till he knows its every throb

so when worthy men are mentioned let us pay acknowledgment

to our cool unswerving praise-deserving friend the president

             man in the rocky mountain country

chapter i

for the mines of montezuma

ot sulphur springs
bubble steam and fume at
the foot of mount bross in
middle park colorado by
these boiling springs two men
were encamped one was a
massive lump of a man a moving moun-
tain of brute strength- hungry joe fair
of heart great of arm young lazy and
ferocious

  the other was of another breed he
could look over- a six-foot rock with ease
and was as slender and straight and supple
as an indian although a black eye was
never seen in a human head the eyes of this
man which seemed to be of black-and-white
agate polished till they glittered to look
into them made one think of gazing fasci-
nated into the black caverns of a pair of
colts forty-fives yet on longer look these
eyes were not jet but a deep steel-blue gray
the second look strengthened the impres-
sion of blued steel though keen and im-
perial those eyes were not unkind but
nothing ever escaped them

  fine silky black hair penciled with
silver white over the temples curling crisply
at the back fell in heavy waves down the
muscular neck to the square shoulders
the jaws were wide and firm even hard
as was the mouth the nose was large
and straight with thin but wide-open nos-
trils that sometimes quivered

  the impression that the man gave can be
summed up in four words-quickness
strength honesty and intelligence

  two thousand miles to the east-along
the old delaware-as a boy they had called
him the grizzly at twenty years of

age when he suddenly came to know that
the advice of horace greeley was good this
name was all that he brought with him
across the big muddy and the great plains
of the rockies his name in the states had
been-well let it pass

  it is neither healthy profitable nor po-
lite to ask such questions in certain parts
of the rockies honest men sometimes
changed their names on the frontier as
often as they did their shirts for no other
reason than caprice this man was mason

  the two men did not know each others
names nor history they had met by ac-
cident three months before while crossing
berthand pass yet they had slept eaten
and worked side by side like all but silent
brothers such was the custom need it
be said they were hunting-hunting for
gold  prospectors those forerunners of
civilization are strange men

  a mountain evening was falling the
smoke from the tiny log-hidden camp-fire
sulked away through the grass and gathered
in the willows supper was over the few
tin dishes were as yet unwashed mason
was smoking hungry joe his tanned fore-
head wrinkled like an old boot was poring
over a faro-deck spread out on his blanket
and laboring to demonstrate an invincible
 system  that always haunted him over
all hung the breathless beauty of the kind-
ling stars rapid almost silent human
footsteps came patting down the game-trail

  a man easy-going shiftless in a way
walked up to the fire

  hospitality blooms at its best within the
light and warmth of a frontier camp-fire
are you hungry eat are you tired
rest who are you what are you why
are you as you are these questions are
never asked it might be unkind perhaps
dangerous


the railroad mans magazine

  on the other hand it is not good form
for a guest to attempt to examine his hosts
rifle or revolver ignorance or violation of
this rule was why some men died there
are various reasons for all of this the
wilderness has laws unto itself distilled
from experience and necessity these to
the untaught sons of civilization are a mys-
tery yet are simplicity itself and the es-
sence of common sense to those who under-
stand

   evening pardner was masons cor-
dial greeting he had risen only onto one
elbow that he might have a better look at
the stranger to have risen to his feet
would have meant open suspicion toward
his guest

  howdy

  hungry joe said nothing but nodded
social forms and language are relaxed when
policemen street-cars and such things are
hundreds of miles away

   any objections if i camp with you peo-
ple my outfit is over the ridge yon-
der followed a trail over into this country
and the fallen timber up the mountain there
tangled me all up so ill feed and snooze
with you if youre willing

  welcome you are pardner youllfind
the grub-box under that bed-sheet help
yourself dishes aint very clean havent
washed diem for a day or two but theres
the hot spring there if youre dainty
theres a hank of elk on the tree and youll
find a swig of forty-rod in that jug in the
cold spring over there if youre inclined that
way i dont use it myself its joes but
youre welcome

  the samson grunted a morose consent
the newcomer took the jug from the cold
spring pointed its bottom to the stars
poured distilled hell down his throat and
then wiped the tears from his eyes

  ah-h-h he gasped if this spring
ran such -tuff id let the new diggins go
to perdition

  new diggins echoed mason while
hungry joe raised his head where
no savey em eh just across the
range from here over the hay back from
st charles must have been long in the
hills not to hear bout em i was on my
way out to em but learned that the reds
are up between here and there-so i dont
know aint you two on vour wav out
also

  no answered mason i havent
heard a word nor seen a white face but

yours for several moons except hungry
joes here and it only used to be white
bah with the injuns how bout the dis-
coveries  

    all trails end there nowdays pardner
biggest thing ever known gold layin
round like sand in this spring some say
theyre the  lost mines of montezuma
if it wasnt for those utes- what day is
to-day 

  not one in the three could tell time
is lost track of in the wilderness tom had
not wound his watch for a month

    lost mines of montezuma  breathed
mason then he rose pardon me stran-
ger i leave you that affair concerns me
injuns ugh im going through em or
around em goin with me joe stran-
ger

  injuns too bad answered the stranger
as his lips kissed the jug neck once more
joe eyed the vanished liquor with thicken-
ing sullenness and shook his head

  hang the injuns im off joe pack
up for me-light mind you-while i sad-
dle rattler ill trade you that pack-jack
of mine and all the grub for all your extra
cartridges and that big six-shooter of yours
is it a go

   sure growled his massive partner as
he rescued the jug from the stranger rolled
it in his blanket and returned to his cards
altogether ignoring masons request toward
packing

  but this the active mason did alone in
three minutes then he saddled a split-ear
indian pony and prepared to start the
stranger spoke

  say hold on said he if i were
you i would not be so quick to attempt to
ride to the east of here alone the utes
have been having ghost-dances and are out
for scalps have cleaned out two outfits
along the grande already besides there
lias been a coach robbery on the smoky
hill route and something between twenty-
five and a hundred thousand dollars besides
a big gold bar is gone three men five
thousand reward thought at first that
your outfit might be them theyre said
to be head this way things are all stirred
up between here and the big muddy it is
risky business to make that ride alone pard-
ner better wait till daylight

   daylight nothing if anything ill hit
the road in the high places at night and lay
over in the timber during the day i wont
do that less i have to im not looking for
mason the grizzly



safety the red coyote that tries to head me
off had better be doing that

  meanwhile the saddle had been flopped
on rattler and the cinches gently tightened
mason buckled on both his own and joes
revolver they were just alike forty-
fours his long twelve-pound rifle was
slipped into its saddle-sheath on the left
side so that it rested easily beneath the knee
on the left side of rattler mason could
never get used to carrying it on the right

   good luck to you pardner hope you
make it said the stranger as they shook
hands

  hungry joe wasted no ceremony on a
good-by but he demonstrated the warmth of
three months outdoor friendship by rub-
bing the cartridges in masons belt with his
all-powerful talisman his invaluable rabbit-
foot then he gripped masons hand with
a parting stay with your hair pardner
mason did not speak but looked all
around into the now clear starlight then
seeing nothing hostile he grabbed rattler
by the cheek-piece of the bridle pulled his
head sharply around and slowly but warily
swung into the saddle

  rattler gave a few wicked pitches then
started for the new diggings fifty miles
away with mason on his back

  back through the pines on the night wind
came masons farewell

   adios for the mines of montezuma-
look out for the dancers and the
y cs  answered the stranger cheerily

  good luck to you pardner bellowed
hungry joe

   that roar started to their feet a herd of
elk bedded down a mile away on ute bill
creek

  mason was gone hungry joe and the
stranger silently listened to the hoof-thuds
growing fainter and fainter and when si-
lence closed round the camp once more
hungry joe handed the uncorked jug to
the stranger

  then they both went to sleep earth
was their couch heaven their canopy

         chapter ii
         a night ride

rthrough the night mason rode over
his right shoulder careened the silver
crescent of the new moon he smiled and
patted the bounding rattler also on the right
shoulder he felt the hard muscles writhe

knot and relax-beneath his palm with the
steady rhythm of machinery the first dash
over mason pulled rattler down to that
mile-killer between a trot and a walk

  mason knew how to ride a horse

  across the four-mile divide he went
ten miles away he struck the frasier later
in the night the horse and rider both still
fresh splashed through first creek twenty
miles on the way then waded crooked
creek and mounted the bluff on which are
the five miles of sage brush flats no in-
dians yet hiding the match-flame in his
hat mason lit his pipe and let rattler loaf
a quarter of a mile

    the lost mines of montezuma  he
kept repeating over and over as in a dream
just what he was going to the new gold-
diggings for mason did not know he
would decide when he got there

   gold gold gold was the lure

  but though he dreamed yellow in his sub-
consciousness his whole active attention
was keenly given to the work in hand-the
ever-changing direction and condition of the
game-trails rattlers breathing the set of
the saddle and all the little things that
would help eat into the miles ahead

  now they were turning up the south fork
that comes down from berthand pass the
trail dipped down into a dark box-canon
rattler trotted around a sharp point of rock
his pointed sensitive ears thrown forward
he snorted and stopped half a mile ahead
was a huge camp-fire around it appear-
ing and disappearing in the light of the
flames jumped limped bounded hopped
and shuffled a number of fantastic figures

  mason swore he knew what it meant
he would have joked with the angel of
death

    rattler old boy there are your utes en-
joying a german or perhaps it is only a
dutchman what are we going to do go
back no sir go through it dont
look like it well ride around but how
about any trails going through mountain
timber after dark with a horse cant be did
the moon will soon set its clouding up
too rain i guess looks like it feels
like it too rattler we must get out of here
and hide out till daylight git 

  an arrow-a purring searching arrow-
whirred over masons shoulder back up
the canon tore rattler mason bent low
over the horses neck two miles in five
minutes is not bad running for a tired cow-
pony up-gradein the dark


the railroad mans magazine

  fearing pursuit by fresh ponies and
afraid of ambush ahead by lurking senti-
nels who had purposely allowed him to pass
unmolested so as to trap him mason sud-
denly turned rattler into the black mouth
of a side canon dismounted and feeling
for the game-trail with his feet led the
panting horse into this temporary haven

  daybreak found the man and horse far up
this branch near the top of the ridge through
which cut the main canon here fallen
timber blocked their way in a small se-
cluded park mason camped

  rattler bridled and saddled was al-
lowed to feed on the tall grass his picket-
rope was fastened to the belt around ma-
sons waist	

  mason made a cold scant breakfast on
beans boiled elk and ice-water then he
smoked and planned clearly it would be
madness to attempt to cross the bare crest
of the ridge above him in daylight the in-
dians on the other side now aware of his
presence would calmly lie in wait for him
to ride into them

  he must wait where he was until near
evening then make his way up the slope
through the fallen timber and remain hid-
den in the upper edge until after darkness
had fallen

  what was on the other side of that ridge
mason did not know at one place a small
water course headed by a clump of scrub
pine ran to the very crest of the ridge ty-
ing rattler in the thick timber out of sight
mason wormed his way part of the time
flat on the ground like a snake up the shal-
low water course to the scrub pines the
other side of the ridge was open in places
from the crest all the way down in others
it was impassable because of burned and
fallen wood

  not an indian was in sight but from a
dozen points the signal smokes were slowly
rising	f

  below and five miles away three wagons
were burning mason carefully studied the
country ahead and picked out his route
seeing a rain-storm coming down the pass
mason wiggled back to rattler tied the
lariat once more around his waist found a
scant shelter under a clump of willows and
with his rifle for a bedfellow lay down to
sleep

  it began to rain - drop drop splash
splash then a down-pour mason was
sleepily thankful foi this would wash out
his back trail but a ute indian can with

painful care follow a rain-washed trail-
and the utes were on the trail

  mason slept

        chapter iii
        rousing the game

 i he shadows were beginning to stretch
away to the east mason was asleep
twice during die day he had risen looked
carefully around and laid down again in a
new spot so that rattler might have fresh
grass

  rattler snorted mason awoke with every
sense on die alert it is a curious thing
but men long on the frontier are able in-
stantly to awake from a deep dreamless
slumber as intuitively aware of what has
recently occurred as if a second nature kept
watch while die conscious mind slept

  masons thumb slipped to the hammer of
his rifle his left arm instantly straight-
ened raising his chest and shoulders from
the ground an indian on horseback was
only twenty feet away

  zip an arrow cut through that sup-
porting left arm and stuck in the grassy bed
where an instant before had rested masons
back the left arm was numbed as if sud-
denly frozen but did not collapse

  with an action like die jump of a steel
spring masons right hand let loose the rifle
whipped his six-shooter from its holster
and two shots answered- the arrow the
indians pony shot squarely in the chest
reared and fell backward crushing its rider
to the ground

  through the shoulder of the rider was a
ragged bullet-hole mason straightened to
his feet pulled the arrow through his arm
swept his limited horizon with a glance saw
nothing hostile and warily advanced toward
the wounded indian and his pony both
down and struggling to arise

  then rattler bolted the picket-rope
was whipped tight mason was jerked from
his feet and dragged half-way head fore-
most across the little park before he could
recover himself with his feet to the front
plowing into the sod he curbed the strain-
ing rattler

  hastily he tied the trembling snorting
horse to a pine tree drawing his remaining
six-shooter and cocking it mason keenly
watching the straining indian ran back
and recovered his rifle and other revolver
in the few seconds that had passed the
mason the grizzly



wounded indians pony had struggled to his
feet where lie stood swaying head droop-
ing legs braced and bloody froth oozing
from his nostrils

  the indian was staggering and reeling
toward the woods in an effort to run

  when shots ring out in the mountains and
the echoes get to playing with them it is
hard to tell at first from where the sounds
come but when once warned an experi-
enced ear can usually tell in what quarter
the following reports originate

  mason knew this the three shots al-
ready fired were still echoing afar many
a red ear was keyed to catch any that might
follow another shot would focus the trails
of half a hundred utes

  mason lowered his rifle he drew his
knife it was long and thin and keen
his sticking knife used to bleed big game

  he darted after the ute the indian
turned he was game to the death he
also drew his weapon a common butcher-
knife but the ute was wounded-stunned
and almost dead

  holding his rifle by the stock in his left
hand mason swung the heavy weapon and
with the barrel struck the indian a terrific
blow on the side of the neck the ute
pitched forward on his face

  darting behind his fallen foe the white
man dropped-with his knees on the others
back he grabbed the long black hair in
his left hand he jerked back the utes
head his knife slashed a long deep cut
across the stretched throat

  like the spring of the blood-snake the red
knife again cut into the quivering indian
with a cry the indian flung the white man
from his back and made a titanic bound
for the woods in mid-air he collapsed and
died striking the ground the body rolled
over on its back to make assurance doubly
sure mason placed his foot down on the
reeking neck and stuck the knife into the
indians breast but the red heart was still

  not waiting an instant mason pulled out
the blade and made for the indians pony
to let it escape would be fatal wander-
ing to the ute camp it would leave a plain
trail from there to masons hiding-place

  the animal had staggered to the stream
that roared down the mountain at the edge
of the park here it was swaying and
trying to drink running with his knife
held at arms length like a rapier mason
plunged it into the ponys side just behind
the left shoulder

   with a grunt the horse sank to its knees
and rolled once on its side then it raised
its head in a wild dumb appeal to the man
it tried to rise it uttered an almost human
cry for mercy the great dark eyes looked
at mason with hurt surprise that look
haunts him yet blood gushed from the
nose and mouth the head drooped and
fell the horse was dead mason dashed
the tears from his eyes and choked

  your life or mine my dumb brother
but it has to be

  but there was no time for regret mason
rolled the carcass into the stream the
water whirled it away striding to the
dead indian mason dragged the body by
the hair to the waters edge and flung it
too into the snowy rushing current

  the water caught the corpse and tore it
along among the rocks and logs mason
stood watching it it was sucked beneath
the green surface suddenly the body was
shot up by hidden currents half its length
up into the sunlight

  it faced mason one arm was tossed on
high in an attitude of cursing vengeance
the head fell back and the mouth gaped
open in a hideous laugh as if in defense
mason threw his arm across his face to shut
out the sight when he looked again the
corpse had disappeared

  all was cool and clear again nothing
but his wounded arm told that there had
been a fight to the death such affairs are
common on the red and white frontier

chapter iv

the chase

jvt asons wound pained but little hur-
riedly in the stream he washed the
blood from his hands and with the cold
water and torn pieces of shirt dressed his
hurt it was not serious in itself no blood
vessels nor sinews had been cut nor bones
broken but yet to a great extent it made
the man one-armed

  the afternoon shadows had lengthened
out a foot action had been rapid mason
ran to rattler go at once anywhere at
any risk they must in an hour forms like
huge red ants would be creeping crawling
running over the whole mountain-side and
the sound of a shot could not go across the
ridge above him

  up through the fallen timber threaded
mason leading rattler he knew that


the railroad mans magazine

somewhere above him on the ridge either
far or near to right or left indians were
on the lookout at the upper edge of the
timber mason paused still hidden he
tied rattler within a dense thicket then
stepped to one side and a little to the front
where the trees were thinner and scanned
the bare ridge

  along the side of that ridge an indian
horseman was coming at a fast lope he
was some three hundred yards away but
was riding rapidly yet cautiously and was
keeping a keen watch on the woods below

  mason rested his cocked rifle in the fork
of a dead sapling and waited the indian
came nearer and still nearer masons
breath came and went hissing through
clenched teeth

  the indian was only a hundred yards
away mason looked at him through the
sights too far to miss meant masons
death if the coming ute kept to the trail
he was following mason saw that he would
pass within fifty feet of him

  a hundred feet away the trail to avoid
a rock ran for about thirty feet straight
toward the pine behind which stood the
statue-like white man mason saw that
this would give him a straight-away shot
the indian pony came loping along the
trail sixty feet more and either an indian
or a white man must die

  the pony swung round the curve and
came leaping along the straight bit of trail
only one hundred feet away the indian
died the riderless pony snorted whirled
and bolted back up the trail

  mason darted to the fallen indian he
tore from the struggling body the long red
head-dress of eagle feathers running back
unmindful of his arm he jerked rattler
loose vaulted into the saddle and spurred
the cow-horse up the hill clinging to his
trophies

  it was a quarter of a mile from the tim-
bers edge to the crest of the ridge no
sooner did the white man get into the open
on the bare mountain-side than far below
him angry shots began to crack and roar

  mason heard them and distant singing
of the lead behind and below him and the
soft spat-spot-spug of the bullets in the
timber he dismounted near the crest of
the ridge and walking let rattler gain
breath for a quick dash over the top

  when the horse and his rider were so
near the top that mason could see down the
other side he paused a moment to survey

 the scene nothing hostile was in sight
 behind and below him all was silent and
 serene but a murmur was dying among the
 cliffs and smoke was floating among the
 tree-tops

   hoping to look as much like an indian
 as possible mason after first blindfolding
 rattler with his handkerchief donned the
 trailing indian head-dress and the red
 blanket mounting he reached forward
 slipped the bandage from rattlers eyes
 and with it waved a derisive farewell to the
 invisible redskins below a few satanic
 yells came faintly up then at an easy
 gallop-the feathers and blanket flying in
 the wind mason crossed the open ridge

   he stood a fair chance to escape the
 slanting side of the ridge had prevented any
 sound of his recent troubles from getting
 over the crest he laughed nervously but
 with a thrill he had never known before
 though hard on rattlers knees and shoul-
 ders mason urged the horse down the dan-
 gerous ridge

   suddenly from the bushes fifty feet ahead
 and slightly to the left an indian arose
 the mongrel dress mason wore half white
 half red together with his tanned face and
 black hair deceived the indian for an in-
 stant for every buck in the red camp was
 wearing pieces of white mans and white
 womans apparel

   the ute who stood in the bushes wore a
 battered yet still shiny silk hat a clean
 white shirt worn with the starched bosom
 behind and with the tails free while knot-
 ted around his vast paunch was a pair of
 womans striped stockings

   over all hung a dirty green blanket the
 indian was drunk otherwise his vanity
 would not thus have overcome his natural
 caution when on the war-trail at the sight
 of this comical yet hideous and dangerous
 apparition rattler snorted reared and
 struck the earth with all four legs stiff and
 braced anyone but a born rider would
 have pitched headlong over the horses head
 and down the hillside

   whip the white mans revolver flashed
  from its holster as the pony snorted

   bang the shot went rolling along the
 mountain-side and down a little narrow
 crooked canon to the right the ute
 whirled gave a grunt clasped both hands
 overhis stomach doubled up belched forth
 a drunken hiccup plunged forward on his
 head flopped a somersault down the slope
 shuddered and died
mason the grizzly



  another minute and mason was out of
sight in the rocky defile

  but over the top of the ridge plunged
three indian horsemen yelling like mad
their eyes caught the last flash of that red
blanket going down the gulch with tri-
umphant shrieks they shot down the ridge
and into the canon in straight pursuit

  the white man was trapped behind
him tore three of the bravest and most skil-
ful warriors of the ute nation ahead of
him was the indian camp escape up the
wall-like sides of the canon was impossible
the smaller canon entered the larger defile
just above the point where clustered the
indian teepees the chasing horsemen be-
hind were firing rifles as a warning to those
in camp ahead

  quiet reigned among the teepees know-
ing well their position and that it was
guarded by scouts both far and near those
within the skin tents were careless of dan-
ger suddenly came the alarm distant
shots and shrieks and the beating of flying
hoofs multiplied by the cafion echoes turned
into a thunderous battle-crash roaring down
the pass and stampeding the lazy camp

  yelling bucks and squaws followed by
their whimpering young went bounding
crawling sneaking up the sides of the main
canon and hid among the rocks then
silence dropped

  the camp and the canon seemed deserted
but among the rocks slunk three hundred
wild men and women waiting in an ambush
for the expected cavalry charge of the sol-
diers beady soaky eyes were focused on
the trail that disappeared around the bend
not far above inferno was booming down
the canon

  around the bend tore a great bay horse
wild-eyed and frantic his neck back and
flying tail were in line his hoofs threw
gravel and stones

  over the saddle-horn bent the rider
around him the ends flopping in the wind
was a red blanket straight out behind
him trailed the feather head-dress in each
hand was a cocked six-shooter behind him
came a similar horseman and another and
still another

  as the second horseman whirled around
the bend shots rang out but dust obscured
the coming route the indians skulking
along the canon-sides thought that the shots
were fired to alarm the camp or else at a
pursuing foe

  click-click-click sounded the cocking

rifles along the canon-side an arrow was
fitted to every bow-string dark subtle
glances shot from the band up the canon to
the race below then back to the bend above

  through the camp plunged the horseman
the thunder of the hoofs and the shrill
yells mingled into a roar the second rider
had emptied his rifle and was reloading as
well as a man might on the back of a -run-
ning horse one shot at the scarlet figure
ahead of him would be understood by those
above and a volley would end the race
but his guns were empty his cues were
drowned and he did not carry bow and
arrows

  the third and fourth rider dared not
shoot for the trail was straight and the
second rider thus protected the hunted one
in the lead the white man did not fire
behind him for to do so would bring a rain
of death from the rocks above mason
knew safety lay only in the eagle feathers
the red blanket his black hair tanned face
and rattlers hoofs

  it was only fifty feet away around the
wall of rock ahead the camp was passed
the second rider had slipped a cartridge
into his pounding rifle he dropped his
reins jerked his gun to his shoulder raised
his rifle and fired at the flying rider ahead

  the indian missed mason ducked his
head threw back his right arm and from
inverted revolver answered back from a
plunging horse bullets fly straighter out of
a revolver than from a rifle the ute and
his pony rolled in a kicking heap together
consternation swept along the caiion-sides
-then a blast of fury the end horseman
reined up with a motion of the sign-lan-
guage he signaled to those lurking above
instantly the canon became a volcano fire
and smoke bullets and arrows war-clubs
and stones burst from behind every rock

  down went rattler down went mason
both lay still one was dead-the other
stunned rattler was riddled mason was
unhurt

  like vultures the indians pounded down
upon the senseless white man an indian
boy bounded down the rocks he halted
he jerked an arrow to his ear an older
man stretched the bow the arrow whistled
away over the tree-tops an indian girl
hurled a stone down at the still upturned
face the jagged piece of granite splin-
tered on the rock beside the white temple

  colorow war chief of the ute nation
leaped astride the captive flung away the


the railroad mans magazine

 white mans weapons dropped his blanket
 over the outstretched form stood -erect and
 raised his rifle threateningly frenzied
 though they were die utes knew colorow
 and obeyed

   the senseless mason was dragged back
 among the teepees the fallen indian
 limped along with the rest he was bruised
 and skinned but otherwise was unharmed
 his pony had a white mans bullet in its
 chest half a dozen powerful utes seized
 mason and flung him into the icy waters of
 the frasier

   strangling and struggling mason revived
 he was dazed standing up knee-deep in
 the current he gazed stupidly at the laugh-
 ing indians then the situation flashed
 upon him like a corraled buffalo bull
 he started here and there only to realize
 that escape was impossible

   reason and coolness came the superior
 mind of the white man must save him if he
 is to be saved at all mason with forced
 calmness scooped up a double handful of
 water and drank this he did again and
 again thinking like lightning he squeezed
 the water from his hair and brushed it back
  out of his eyes felt to see if his water-tight
 pouch containing tobacco and matches was
 safe then he waded ashore and held out
 his hand to colorow

    how

    ugh  and the famous-and infamous
 -old ute chief heartily shook masons
 hand

  wash heap good after run much
 warm

   colorow smiled with sardonic sweetness
 mason wanted to strangle the sarcastic brute
 but said nothing

   indians admire all brave men they wor-
 ship courage the indian is not a coward
 anglo-saxon standards are foolish and
 foolhardy to him but in his own way a
 braver man never trod the earth than the
 american indian death he does not fear
 fortune he ignores thrust and parry is
 his way of fighting-not hack and hew as
 does the anglo-saxon he creeps in darts
 away and lures to ambush the white man
 plunges in a bayonet charge the indian
 is the rapier the white man the battle-ax
 yet even against tremendous odds the in-
 dian can close in like a badger and battle
 in a way that would make the fanatics of
 asia and africa stand aghast and to a
 captive the tearing-rock of the inquisition
 would be a bed of roses compared to the

agony of indian torture to an indian
prisoner the fiends of purgatory would seem
angels of mercy alongside of his tormentors

  all this mason knew he dropped the
hand of colorow and lit his pipe

chapter v

prisoner of the utes

twilight was thickening into dusk

a every ute in the canon except the
outlying scouts was seated in many a con-
centric circle around a glowing bed of coals
over this fire bubbled a caldron half full
of boiling water the caldron was as large
as a barrel it had been taken from
the wagon-train that mason had seen burn-
ing that morning it had been used by
the murdered family of soap-makers

  eleven wet red scalps were drying on
poles before colorows teepee one was of
red curly hair four brown two black
these seven by their short hair had evi-
dently come from mens skulls another of
the gory trophies had a long splendid mane
of wavy brown another was scant and gray
-the scalps of women two more scalps
smaller than the others hung there that of
a golden-haired little girl and the short-
cropped one of a boy these were the evi-
dence of indian valor

  near the caldron apart from the silently
eager circles stood a group of thirty bucks
chiefs and medicine-men some were
decked out in full war-gear with here and
there white mans and white womans gar-
ments worn fantastically all were hideous
with paint the large circles of seated in-
dians were glumly silent but this group was
having a lively powwow

  in the center of this smaller group the
focus of every eye in the canon stood ma-
son stripped of his clothing his hands
and elbowswere bound behind his bent
back the animated group were hotly de-
bating whether to throw their captive into
the scalding kettle bound as he was or cut
his bands and toss him free into the boiling
water so that he could leap out only to be
thrown back again and again

  this would slowly cook him alive it
would prolong his agony as well and length-
en and intensify the pleasure of the whole
camp

  the advocates of the slow torture won
their point colorows knife cut the raw-
hide thongs mason was free yet face to
mason the grizzly



face with worse than death he gave one
wild look around then shot his glances to
the distant mountain-tops still gleaming in
the sunlight

  twenty naked indians surrounded him
a desperate struggle on his part would have
been great fun for them at the worst it
would be only a life-and-death wrestling
match with the outcome sure mason was
as helpless as a rabbit amid a pack of
wolves but he had the cold anglo-saxon
brain the utes had only barbaric cunning

  mason coolly started to walk to the steam-
ing kettle when within ten feet of it and
just as the indians with a chorus of hideous
yells were grasping for him mason spat in
the face of an indian stripling

  this young buck the eldest son of colo-
row was a privileged character in the band
a snarl burst from the lips of colorow
it was an order the indians released ma-
son and stepped back

  colorow grunted to his son the young
devil with a sweep of his blanket wiped his
face he reached down and split a long
fine sliver from a piece of fire-wood light-
ing this and leering at his cool silent
motionless though helpless victim the in-
dian boy slowly pressed the burning stick
against masons chest for an instant ma-
son stood like a disdainful marble statue

  then his right arm shot out like that of a
cornered grizzly his fingers clutched the
hair of his tormentor whirling and hump-
ing his back mason hurled the son of
colorow over his shoulder and into the
scalding kettle

  it was a wrestling trick he learned on the
delaware the boys wild shriek was
drowned in the roar of indian yells con-
fusion reigned like the penned wild bull
he was mason crashed against the indian
line surrounding him through that red
line he went like a snow-plow

  it was all over in an instant mason
was sprinting down the canon for a moment
unpursued the kettle was overturned the
scalding son of colorow rolled out dying
then like yelping coyotes the entire camp
save colorow and a few old men tore down
the canon after the fleeing white man it
was white-man training against indian
swiftness and white-man training won as
mason sprinted round a bend in the canon
that red hurricane was left behind the
way to freedom and to life was sure around
the next bend mason leaped plumb into the
middle of a band of indian horsemen

   	rr

  the indian pony in the lead reared
whirled on his hind feet and bolted with
his rider squarely into the horse behind him
mason was trapped behind him were three
hundred utes before him was red shirts
band of four hundred more to the right
and left were perpendicular merciless walls
of granite mason stopped

  he knew red shirt in time of peace
he and red shirt had been friends as nearly
so as red and intelligent white can be friends
which is saying little mason in defiance
of the united states had once made red
shirt gloriously drunk simply for a capri-
cious desire to see what the ute would do
when frenzied

  red shirt on his split-eared pinto over-
whelming in feathers paint and gaudy
blanket galloped up his rifie-muzzle cov-
ering masons breast behind mason on
winged moccasined feet came slow but sure
death in red shirt was a slender chance

   how red shirt me grizzly mason
savvy red-eye bug juice heap drink
by iron rock two moons ago gasped
mason as he shoved his hand up to the
chief

  ltgh si how here grunted red
shirt suspiciously

  before mason could answer a dozen of
his pursuers darted around the bend and
without a glance at the mounted band
hurled themselves on their white prisoner

  mason was buried beneath a hill of scar-
let fury they would have killed him then
and there but for red shirt through no
friendship for mason but because he wished
that he and his followers might help kill the
white man- in the most delicious fashion
red shirt yelled a command at the writhing
heap his words carried little weight but
the muzzles of half a dozen of his nftns
rifles bore a silent meaning not to be ignored
for an instant mason was now the pris-
oner of red shirt

  the coming of red shirts band was
expected but his arrival that night was a
surprise signal-smokes that morning how-
ever had warned him that blue-coated horse-
men were camping on his trail from bitter
experience red shirt knew the meaning of
that so he had traveled fast even for an
indian

  it was dark in the canon when red shirt
rode into the camp of colorow news of
the coming cavalry put the whole camp into
a ferment

  foaming inwardly but outwardly placid
s

the railroad mans magazine

he urged that the ite nation here in the
canon where his son had died make its
great war-tight against the paleface but
red shirt was for die safety that lies only
in the growing trail colorow was a mighty
chief the canon was good for ambush yes
but his men were tired and their arrows
were few

  the truth was that red shirt had a most
unhealthy fear of soldier steel it was
colorows son not his who had been killed
as colorows band was afraid to fight un-
aided and as red shirt and his followers
could go on alone colorow had no choice
but to agree to red shirts plan an hours
rest was to be taken however and to cele-
brate the safe reunion of the two bands
the would burn the white captive

  red shirt over whose mind darkly hov-
ered the fear of those trailing cavalrymen
carelessly suggested that mason be set free
and that the utes send him over the back
trail as an agent of peace the foxy old
scoundrel hoped thus to have a friend at
court when those blue hounds ran him down
but the death of colorows son who some
day would have been at the head of the ute

                        to be

nation so his father had hoped and the
disgrace of it all fired the old chief with a
hatred that nothing could cool except wreak-
ing on mason the most excruciating torture

   he vehemently demanded masons tor-
ment he related the death of the indian
that afternoon in the little meadow the
killing of the galloping horseman at the
timbers edge the shooting of the drunken
warrior at the head of the branch canon
and last and greatest the scalding disgrace
to colorow himself and to the whole ute
nation in the death of his eldest son

    red shirt yielded

   mason was tied to a dead tree the
green rawhide encircled only his waist his
arms and legs were free around him were
heaped dry brush and broken limbs seven
hundred delighted indians gathered to watch
the human fuel light up the canon

    hope left mason the fearful strain of
the past day and night had all but broken
him the reins of self-control were snap-
ping the fever of the crazed was begin-
ning to sear his brain when he lifted his
eyes to the stars-ah the depths there the
cool free peace he was not afraid

largest ferry-boat in the world

the famous carquinez strait is a long narrow
arm of san francisco bay and is located
about twenty-eight miles eastward of san fran-
cisco the main line of the southern pacifics
limited route between san francisco and port-
land oregon crosses this strait

  the transfer of trains is made by means of a
mammoth railway ferry-boat-the solano which
is the largest railway ferry-boat in the world in
total length this craft is nearly  feet and wide
enough for four parallel tracks-representing
about  feet of trackage

  its capacity is ample to accommodate the very
longest and heaviest freight or passcnger-train at
one time originally this immense boat cost the
southern pacific about one hundred thousand dol-
lars and since its completion a large additional
sum has been expended in the way of repairs over-
hauling etc

  carquinez strait is nearly one and a half miles
in width and usually about twenty-five minutes
are required in crossing the solano is a side-

wheel craft and the engines are of one thousand
horse-power each making a total of two thousand
horse-power driving force

  for a long time the southern pacific has been
considering the plan of bridging the strait how-
ever this project has been very strenuously op-
posed by the old shipping interests of the state
as well as the war department

  the only kind of structure that could be built
across carquinez strait without any active oppo-
sition would be a suspension bridge engineers
consider that the latter structure would scarcely
be feasible besides the cost would be immense
however at the dumbarton point bridge across
the southern arm of san francisco bay has just
been completed hereafter all of the heavy freight-
trains will be sent around that way this will
relieve the immense strain of traffic now imposed
on the giant ferry-boat solano as well as obviat-
ing the necessity of building a bridge at an enor-
mous outlay of money to the system-locomotive

 the nerve of engineers

by robert h rogers

nerve so frequently attributed to railroad men is rather an indefinable
quality but the claim that if an engineer once loses it he will never
get it back again is apparently borne out in many of the anecdotes
with which this stirring occupation is necessarily replete it is remarkable
that nerve which will permit the blowing of signals to dead men and then
remain unshaken while wreck after wreck is in review as a nightly pastime
could be shattered by any situation within the ken of man but any terminal
will exhibit more than one former hero of the fast mail now relegated to the
plebeian switch-engine because his  road-nerve  is gone

startling incidents that caused throttle-handlers to suddenly lose the
peculiar sense of security which kept them calm
and cool in the face of danger

my engine wasnt steaming very good but
his was so he made an exceptionally fast
run and managed to make weverton and
get into clear on the turnout about two min-
utes before i came through and i was
going so fast that i threw dust on every one
of his cars

  when i saw that train in there i knew
that the orders had been mixed and knew
right away how close i had been to getting
it i was that scared thinking over it that
i dropped twenty minutes from there to the
end of the division and i never ran an
engine again after that trip

  they discharged the train-despatcher
who lapped the orders but that didnt do
me any good his  bull  drove me to this
scrap-pile because oatside of running this

roberts one day as he was
sorting scrap-iron in the foundry

years of activity on the cannon

while the other fellows called for the meet
to be at weverton i know because i saw
his orders afterward these places were
ten miles apart with weverton nearest to
me so that i would have to pass it to make
the meeting point named in my orders for-
tunately although i cursed it at the time

is all they think i know how to do for the
railroad

  the stirring life that railroad engineers
lead would appear to be mmune to both
superstition and sentiment but it has its full
measure of strange even inexplicable hap-
penings which well illustrate that neither
emotion is lacking in the make-up of the si-
lent occupant of the engine-cab who handles
the night-express at a tearing clip through
a world of gloom

  under certain conditions his work often
begets curious fancies and it need not be
wondered at because his is a lonely job be-
yond the belief of those behind in the
brilliantly lighted train

a tribute to the dead

  one dark rainy evening when the 
with the famous royal limited was plun-
ging down foys hill at a pace which the
fireman tersely described as like the ham-
mers of hell two mournful blasts of the
whistle sounded unexpectedly overhead

  there was nothing in front however no
flag or no signal to be so answered the
headlight shone fitfully on a wall of driving
mist with only the white gleam of a sema-
phore advancing in arrowy flight to give
us the right of way some vague curiosity
impelled me to seek information and when
a straight stretch of track permitted i
crawled-cautiously around the swaying boil-
er-butt and into the cab behind engineer
parlett

  what did you blow for back there
i shouted in his ear through the wind

  walt furley was killed there he an-
swered in similar cadence at that last
ignal-pole we passed he was leaning too
far out of the cab and it struck him on the
head i always toot the whistle when i go
by so that if poor furleys spirit is about
he will know that we havent forgotten him

  as we sped at reduced speed over the
susquehanna river bridge the fireman
whispered to me confidentially he never
forgets to blow and several other engineers
do the same thing it gives me a kindof
creepy feeling though

  it gave me one too and small blame
could be attached to either under the cir-
cumstances there was something inexpress-
ibly weird in that touching tribute to the
departed and the wild night together with
the strident discord incidental to high speed
lent added effectiveness

  mile after mile in sixty seconds we had
sped through the storm to the accompani-
ment of the thundering exhaust roaring
culverts and rattling switch-points punc-
tuated at regular intervals by the clang
clang of the fire-door while the gale moaned
unceasingly as ifan uneasy spirit were in
its breath

in the wee small hours

  i have been on that same run many times
at night with refractory injectors and the
engine not steaming as she should but never
once have i missed seeing the engineer reach
for the whistle-lever at the scene of poor
furleys undoing

  i remember on one occasion after a long
ride on the firemans seat-box of the eastern
express i sought the right side of the cab
for company and incidentally filled the role
of a rather unwilling listener to some grim
revelations as dawn whitened the sky behind
blue ridge until then the engineer ap-
parently intent on the track and his mys-
terious  marks -a sealed book to any one
but himself-had scarcely noticed me

  for nearly three hours he had remained
practically in the same position on the seat-
box his legs crossed with his right knee con-
veniently disposed as a prop for the arm and
hand which held his chin and his left hand
resting carelessly on the brake-valve at
irregular intervals but seemingly in unison
with an opening of the fire-door when the
dim interior of the cab would suddenly be-
come suffused with a crimson glow this
habitual though unconsciously effective pose
was lost for a moment he would look at
his watch run his eye comprehensively
over the array of gages behind the flicker-
ing little lamp and then over the fireman
and myself but always returning quickly
and with automatic precision to the eternal
vigil ahead

gruesome memories

   in about half a minute he observed
noting my occupancy of a portion of his
seat  we will go by the place where this
engine struck a rock once and turned over
on john stevens it was on this run too
you can tell easy when you get to it be-
cause she always cuts up a bit in there
though i have never found out why

  just then the fireman put in another fire
the engineer peered at the water-glass shut
the nerve of engineers



off the injector and began his harrowing
recital in rapid succession while the ac-
tual localities ghostlike in the mist of early
morning flitted by the cab he pointed to
where dave ziler and charley quarles had
been killed in head-on collision where the
 had plunged down an embankment
and indicated the very switch over the mis-
placed points of which the  had been con-
verted into a mass of junk

  to nerves not attuned to the symphony
of the rail this narration could not be other
than disheartening it requires a long ap-
prenticeship before one can even acquire a
fancied security while borne on the wings
of the wind by a hundred-ton monster of
iron and steel but when this novel expe-
rience is supplemented by a cold matter-of-
fact tale covering wreck and lingering
death it is small wonder that each unusual
tremor of the locomotive gives rise to dread
and nameless foreboding beyond the power
of words to express

  in moods like this providence is devout-
ly thanked for the presence of that simple
brake-valve because you know that the
slightest movement of its stubby brass han-
dle will call into being a mighty giant to
seize the wheels in its fifty-thousand-pound
grip of steel and grind them to a stop before
even two train-lengths have been covered

  when i left the engine at the end of the
run i asked of my eagle-eye friend

   do you often think of those things you
have been telling me about

  yes every night when i pass the spots
where they happened i knew all of those
men and they were good men but they got
it like all of us will who follow this game
long enough i dont think about it when
i am off duty though because i might lose
my nerve

  nerve what do you mean by that
i asked

   i dont know he replied simply  ive
never lost it so i dont know what it is

millers last run

  the circumstances which resulted in the
man we will call george graham an engi-
neer on a prominent eastern road parting
with this necessary adjunct to his calling
were of a nature so singular that although
fifteen years or more have passed they are
still discussed by the rank and file but ever
without solution

for a long time graham ran no  a

fast train which was pulled by engine 
with fireman william miller through
their close association on the foot - plate
and harmonious intercourse in general
their friendship had come to imply much
more than the common acceptance of the
term in fact so high was the esteem in
which the engineer was held by miller that
the latter steadily refused promotion that he
might continue as his fireman

  thus matters stood when miller was at-
tacked with brain-fever and hurried to a
hospital graham made a number of trips
with an extra fireman and no doubt would
have done so on the fated day had he not
on the previous night dreamed vividly that
his fellow worker was at deaths door re-
proaching himself for the neglect which he
had exhibited he arranged for his run to
be covered and hurried to the hospital ta-
king with him his own physician dr j l
moore now practising in baltimore for
consultation with the hospital staff

  that morning miller whose previous
symptoms had been favorable to recovery
became suddenly very ill and he raved con-
tinually from an early hour until noon
the physician who visited him at ten oclock
found him calling repeatedly on george
graham and begging him not to work that
day there were many other disjointed ut-
terances of which no record was preserved
but the burden of his cries seemed to be
that his old engineer was in imminent dan-
ger he did not recognize graham who
with dr moore remained at the hospital

  exactly at  pm a change came over
the sick man noticeable at once by the at-
tendant for the first time in many hours
his delirium assumed the form of coherent
speech and in a ringing voice which start-
led the entire ward came the words we
are three minutes late 

  thinking the case had assumed a crisis
dr moore hurried to administer whatever
relief might be possible he found the pa-
tient apparently in the same condition- as on
his previous visit-high fever his heart ac-
tion weak and oblivious to all surround-
ings after a few moments the strident
voice continued with a varying interval be-
tween each exclamation

a vision that proved true

   hit her up old man  she is steaming
good and we have only seven cars to-day
she will stand an extra notch on the hill


the railroad mans magazine

if you want to give it to lier see her walk
them over silver springs good old mill
this-and now she is eating them up
through kensington as though she never
had a car rockville to morristown is
only a step for her two minutes late here
george but she will have it all back before
she is over the flats

  a pause of several minutes succeeded it
seemed to the engineer that the sufferer was
living in his delirium some past run on the
express and dr moore accustomed as he
had become to such ravings attached no
significance to the words although he re-
mained in attendance presently he began
again but this time in a startled tone which
struck terror to those who listened

    what is that freight doing on the main
look and his voice rose into a shriek of
dread there ahead of us he cried
 standing at the water-plug by harden
bridge they have overlooked our time
too late too late

   suddenly the fireman rose nearly erect on
his cot and pointing in the direction of the
clock on the wall uttered in a tone of awe
and solemnity now george graham
prepare to meet your god  he fell back
in a deep coma while the terror-stricken
engineer and even the physician who was
startled out of his professional reserve
glanced furtively at the timepiece it indi-
cated seventeen minutes after four miller
never recovered consciousness

  in the meantime the engineer convinced
that something had gone wrong on his run
deserted the bedside of his dying friend and
hurried to the roundhouse of course they
laughed at him when he said that no  

  o

was into it at harden bridge but while
in the midst of the banter a hurried call for
the wrecking-train brought tragic confirm-
ation to the firemans vision

  the fated train had collided with a
freight at the exact point where miller had
seen it in his delirium some twenty-five
miles from the terminal in absolute fidel-
ity to detail he had depicted the facts in
his ravings just as they had occurred the
train left three minutes late it was two
minutes late at morristown and met the
freight about three miles beyond the crew
of the latter with orders to run ahead of a
following passenger - train completely lost
sight of the fast express thundering to meet
them and stopped at harden to take wa-
ter the wreck occurred at seventeen min-
ute- after four and the extra engineer and

fireman who were substituting for miller
and graham with five others were among
the dead

  that was the end of grahams railroad-
ing from that day he never turned an-
other wheel his nerve was gone and he
knew it and with its passing he dropped
forever from the iron trail

  the majority of these distressing cases
however wherein men have lost their nerve
do not embody the supernatural element
which seemed to play such a -striking part
in the passing of fireman miller often
these fancies are almost childlike especially
when entertained by men whose very trade
implies a tilt with death from the blowing
of the starting whistle to the end of the run

  no better engineer ever pulled a train
than sam lettner who not long ago retired
from the service of one of the southern
trunk lines he was driven to the occupa-
tion of country storekeeper simply because
he believed that some internal convulsion
was destined to occur in his new engine
which would instantly convert it into scrap

  he was a relic of the old days before
the advent of the compound locomotive
with its bewildering array of rods and cross-
heads and when one of these mechanical
marvels fell to his lot he was afraid of it
he could not reconcile with safety the ever-
present spectacle when at high speed of
whizzing pistons valve-rods and what not
all in opposite directions to one another and
utterly at variance with the rythmical thrust
of the single connecting-rod to which he had
been accustomed and his mind dwelt con-
stantly on the possibility of a mix-up in the
mechanism

  it was in vain that the master mechanic
and even the companys mechanical engi-
neer tried to reason him out of this fallacy
while on the road he remained on his feet
actually afraid to sit down from one end of
the division to the other the company had
no other engine to give him and finally the
compound got his nerve so he quit

  these curious mental phases have been
explained after a fashion it is reasoned
that in view of the feeling of responsibility
which rests heavily on the mind of even
the most blase engineer though he may
never exhibit it renders him keenly alert
and when alone in the dark with his iron
charge he is apt to prove extremely sus-
ceptible to the formation of an idea or
chain of ideas which often results in a posi-
tive delusion

 by richard duffy

             there was some real gun-play in the tower
             as the limited tore through the darkness

few

allo hallo yes this is
jim ferris who are-oh
hallo charley i didnt
know your voice yes i
just let number sixteen go
through on the new track
all out of breath and an hour late lonely
here well i guess nothing but black
woods on every side and the last end of
dunston three miles away

  his eyes swept round the tower as he
spoke taking in all the familiar objects-
the line of levers to work the signals and
the switches the big clock his picture cal-
endar and the big windows of many little
panes that were wide open on the darkness

  whats that he asked charley len-
nox who was at the other end of the wire
in a tower in the dunston yards

  oh to-morrow ill have company he
said as the question was repeated the
paiuter will be fixing up this shack like
new he came to-day borrowed some to-
bacco left his ladders under my window

and called it half a days work then he
went away yes the school is still there
up on the hill but the girls have never been
here since which one oh yes i still
have her book

  ferris asked this almost before the other
man had got his inquiry over the wire he
turned his head away from the telephone
sharply some one was rapping on the
lower door of the tower

  thats right he went on hurriedly
the rapping continued and more insistent-
ly the limited goes through at 
not a thing to do till then except fix my
nails and curl my hair slong old man
ferris snapped the receiver into its hook
and listened a moment to the rapping on
the door below with eyes and ears alert
he stepped softly to his clothes-closet which
stood next the telegraph table he reached
up to the shelf and got his revolver with
the revolver in his right hand and a white
lantern in his left he went over on tiptoe
to the door that led down-stairs



he saw her shyly get hold of
the revolver


the railroad mans magazine

    whos there  he called out sternly
   from outside came a faint voice

    if you please sir let me come in

   it sounded to ferris like a womans voice
then followed quickly a frantic beating
of hands on the door and cries of  help
riease sir wont you help me

  he thought for a moment then slipped
his revolver into his pocket and pulled the
chain that opened the door

  instantly it was opened and slammed
shut then he heard footsteps on the stairs

   holding the lantern above his head he
looked down saying

   no one can come up here its against
the rules

    you must let me in just for a minute 
she cried and came up panting before him
my life depends on it 

   he stood in front of her  so does my
job he said

   she slipped past him into the room and
he turned swiftly holding the lantern so
that he could get a good look at her

  she was not more than twenty and very
pretty though her brown eyes were big with
fear and the pallor of her face queer in
the lamplight she wore a summer travel-
ing dress and hat and carried a light coat
on her arm she glanced here and there
timidly her whole attitude was that of a
woman in a panic of shame and terror

   ferriss clean-cut solid face and figure
were fixed before her like a human interro-
gation point not a detail of her appear-
ance or expression escaped him yet there
was nothing offensive or overbearing in his
scrutiny for all his loose shirt open at
the collar and rolled at the sleeves and des-
pite his steady gaze the woman faced him
confidently he said with an inscrutable
smile

   oh its you is it

   she started violently  you know me
    i know your first name is evelyn

   you do she queried incredulous

  he smiled hospitably  i think your
last name is day

   i knew theyd do it she cried excited-
ly gripping her hands at her breast

  do what he asked but at that mo-
ment the telegraph began to click and he
passed behind her to his table she walked
after him fearfully and as if by mechanical
imitation

   laying the lantern undr the table and
his revolver on it he sat down to take
the message as he did so he motioned to

a chair close by saying wont you sit
down  

  she was sitting with her back to him
and he glanced her way from time to time
she was mumbling something just as he
finished his receipt of the message he saw
her slyly get hold of the revolver

  he grabbed her wrist he leaned over
and gently forced it out of her hand say-
ing

   i beg your pardon this is my gun
wheres yours  

   he put it on the shelf of the closet and
shut the door standing with his back to it

    give it to me give it to me please 
she pleaded hysterically

   he led her back to the chair and sat her
down

   youve got to play with your own
thats mine he told her laughing

   throwing her hands to her face she be-
gan to sob heartbrokenly  dont make fun
of me

  make fun of you he inquired bend-
ing over her why-

  the telephone-bell rang it was len-
nox again asking that ferris read to him
the special order to be sure they had it right

   ferris read from the flimsy sheet on his
file

     the president of the road in a special
follows on the heels of the limited only
god himself can stop either one of them 
he hung up the receiver went to his
levers and as he worked one found the
young woman standing beside him

   what did you say she asked huskily
 excuse me please if that sounded like
swearing but theres something doing to-
night

   she seemed to have recovered her poise
and said sharply

    i came here to stop the limited i must
reach new york before-

   this is a switch-tower not a station
you know that miss day

  how do you know my name

    i know you a good deal better than you
think he answered enigmatically and
kept his eyes on hers

   she felt somehow that this man did know
her but how she did not try to divine
it was enough that he seemed to like her
in her desperation though it was ignoble
she swiftly decided to play on whatever
sympathy he might have for her

   she laid her hand softly on his arm and
was ashamed because the contact changed
for the heart of evelyn



him so his face flushed his eyes bright-
ened and he took up her hand as if to kiss
it then suddenly he pushed it away
from him

   she stood very near him

   you will stop the limited for me wont
 you it means life or death to me her
 voice had fallen to a whisper

   he looked down at her sharply  stay
 youre running away
 from the school over
 there arent you

 to get married 

  she fell back
shrinkingly i
knew theyd do it

theyve sent out an
alarm for me

    i didnt know it

i just guessed it

miss day

   far away a whis-
 tle long and shrill
 pierced the air

   limited passes in
 twelve minute s

ferris said as if
talking to himself
and proceeded to try
several of his switch-
levers

  the girl glanced
about the room wild-
ly suddenly she
saw the red lantern
under the table she
took it up and was
making for the door

  ferris sprang in
front of her

   they cant
blame you for this
she cried striving to
work by him

   give me that lamp  he commanded
roughly

   she gazed up into his steady eyes plead-
 ingly

    its life or death for me 

   he put his hand over hers and gradually
 forced the lantern out of her grasp having
 put it back in its place he said very quietly

    its life or death for two hundred pas-
 sengers

   the limiteds whistle sounded again and
 nearer

  its coming its coming she cried
hoarsely and ran to the stairway

  ferris caught her just as she was starting
down and pulled her back into the room
what are you going to do he asked
she faced him smiling and said with
quiet despair

   i must stop the train somehow mr

- i want to tell you something you

seem to know about me as you said and
though i came over here with some of the
girls from the school
last fall i dont ever
remember seeing you
in fact i remember
i hadnt the slightest
interest in coming
here you see her
eyelids fell and a
blush showed in her
cheeks and neck-
 you see i was very
much in love to-
night i ran away
with the man-

   you have not
married him have
you ferris asked
sharply

  no she an-
swered lifelessly
 he said wed go to
new york at once
and be married we
took dinner at the
mountain house
tears began to
stream from her
eyes then he
told me that we
couldnt go to new
york to-night as he
didnt have enough
money i gave him
what i had-but he
said too that we
were registered at the mountain house as
man and wife and-

  she stopped in a fit of sobbing

  dont cry dont cry said ferris
tell me

   i stole away while dinner was being
served and came here-

  why didnt you go to dunston and get
the  train

  is there an  train she asked be-
wildered

   summer schedule in effect to-day
but youre not going to new york youre
going back to the school

from outside came a faint voice


the railroad mans magazine

  she shook her head sadly  i left them
a letter this afternoon they believe im
on my way to new york theyll have tele-
phoned father-oh cant you see that if i
could only get to him to-night-

  a heavy hand beating on the door below
startled them they were silent listening
cautious the knocking was repeated

  ferris put his finger on his lips as a sig-
nal to her and led her to the closet shutting
the door half-way

  a track-walker he whispered then
he went to the door and called down

  that you bill sammis

  the girl pulled the closet door shut on
herself	

  whos down there anyway ferris
yelled

  the head of a ladder appeared in the
window and as ferris turned in a flash at
the sound he saw a man spring into the
room

  iu a glance ferris had comprehended
his good figure good clothes his air of
assurance and his handsome suspicious
face of pasty complexion

   a kind of a ladys novel hero was the
railroad mans mental note

  the man smiled showing white even
teeth under a close-cut black mustache
ferris scowled

 good evening mr towerman he be-
gan pleasantly my name is wainwright
my name is ferris-and theres the
door he retorted calmly  and you cant go
too quickly im busy

  a bit nasty arent you said mr
wainwright looking all about him  its
the heat i suppose

  no said ferris  its you

   me why you dont know me

   thats just it said ferris  this way
ut he pointed to the door

   thats true i havent got much time
mr wainwright went on blithely  i want
you to stop the limited mr ferris and i
pay in advance

  he tossed a fat bundle of bills at the
towermans feet

  ferris kicked the bills back to him across
the floor saying with composure  the com-
pany pays me mr wainwright

  mr wainwright stared at him then
laughed a short ironical laugh as he picked
up the bills and put them in his pocket

  the whistle of the limited shrieked again
it seemed as if it must pass the tower the
next moment

  ferris stepped to the telegraph-table and
began to click off a message mr wain-
wrights beady black eyes had been follow-
ing the towermans every movement and ex-
pression but suddenly they fixed them-
selves on the closet door

  calling for help are you he asked
the towerman

  ferris lifted up his head to glare at the
intruder and found himself covered with
an automatic revolver

   i was going to explain to you courteous-
ly why its absolutely necessary for me to
board the limited but youre a bit thick
in your way time flies be quick mr
ferris look at that closet

  ferris did look and his heart stopped
for an instant a bit of white lineii was
sticking out at the foot of the door

  youve no right to be here get out
ferris roared

   as much right i fancy as your sweet-
heart has the man returned suavely

  you lie ferris cried raising his arm
as if to strike

  still smiling and polite mr wainwright
advanced and aimed his weapon at closer
range saying

   about three feet above that innocent bit
of white a bullet should find her heart-a
foot higher lets say her head

   if you shoot that woman- ferris be-
gan but mr wainwright interrupted him

   you love that little girl in there better
than your job im sure be a man save
her 

  mr wainwrights five feet ten of bone
and muscle were perfectly poised on his feet
and as he kept his revolver conveniently
disposed either to force ferris to the levers
or shoot through the thin pine door of the
closet he seemed to be trying to exert a
malign influence over the towerman with his
beady eyes and hard smile

  the cold sweat stood on ferriss fore-
head as facing mr wainwright all the
time he found his way to the levers five
minutes were left to him in which to decide
the paramount crisis of his life mr wain-
wright had said he loved the girl in the
closet better than his job how he hated
the smooth smirking intruder and how
did the fellow know he loved the girl

  ferris wiped his sweaty hands on a cloth
as he got ready to work the switches mean-
while he mumbled their plan to himself in
a maudlin way like a man bereft of his
will
for the heart of evelyn



   limited-track four he babbled
 freight on siding-track two presidents
special-three minutes-one hundred-two
hundred passengers-only god himself-
he swayed and went suddenly dizzy
so that he leaned helpless against his levers

   mr wainwright was at his side instantly
patting his shoulder and whispering

    its all right old man its for the girl
the heats got you tell me which one
to pull and ill do the-

the touch of the mans hand went through
ferris like an electric shock he jumped
back from the switches and fairly screamed
no you wont and i wont either my
orders stand 

  ill kill her then mr wainwright
growled and made a dash toward the closet
ferris sprang after him

  the closet door flewr open and holding
ferriss revolver before her the girl almost
leaped into mr wainwrights arms

   at first glimpse of her he staggered back
with a cry

    evelyn 

  but she was past him beside ferris who
had grabbed his weapon from her

  mr wainwrights arms had fallen to his
side	 

   shoot now the towerman suggested
 odds are even

  mr wainwright mopped his brow with
the air of a gentleman reasserting himself
quietly slipped his pistol into his pocket
and laughed a long hollow laugh

    mr-ferris i believe you call yourself
it appears you have already met my wife
introductions are unnecessary

   the limited tore by the next moment with
a pounding roar

  that isnt true the girl protested
you know it isnt true

  she remained still near the towerman
who though occupied with his levers con-
trived to keep his revolver ready in his right
hand

   i am very sorry we have given you any
trouble said mr wainwright loftily and
advanced to take her  ill see you are
rewarded for doing your duty

   ferris swung round as if on a pivot and
his revolver almost touching the mans tem-
ple he said

  iwant your gun without another
word he took it from the mans pocket
 now you stand nice and quiet for a minute
while i tell you something i wont keep
you long but i must tell you

   i dont think my wife and i need to
continue this acquaintance any longer mr
towerman retorted mr wainwright ner-
vous but sneering

   dont be sassy said ferris grinning
 this gun is so near your head that if it
went off i couldnt stop it from hitting you
you thought you did a pretty slick trick
in persuading this young lady to run away
thinking you would take her to new york
and be married but you overdid it that
was a mistake to write her down on the book
at the hotel she didnt even mean to have
dinner with you but she had to carry
out the game a little farther than she ex-
pected you see she was bound for me in
the first place but she had to go to dun-
ston to get a train to come out here where
i have two friends a man and his wife
coming as witnesses you cant ask a girl to
walk three miles along the railroad-track
alone a hot night like this especially when
shes dressed up to be married

  mr wainwright stared incredulously at
the towerman and then glanced at the girl
she was leaning against the wall quivering
as if with palsy her face hidden in her
hands

   you common liar- mr wainwright
began

  look out ferris cried pressing the
barrel of the pistol against mr wain-
wrights temple  i know its loaded
evelyn he went on quietly get me that
paper book on the table  the precipitate
marriage you remember

  when she heard him call her by her name
she was startled she looked at him and
his steady gray eyes had a command in them
she had never seen before

  she went over to the table found the
paper novel and brought it back to him
dutifully

  when mr wainwright tried to catch her
eyes she turned her face away and as if
in a daze slunk back to the table

  ferris handed the novel to mr wain-
wright and bade him read the inscription
on the fly-leaf

  evelyn day to james ferris the
mac read and added quickly but your
name is not in her handwriting do you
think you can put up a-

  that was just the idea you see mr
wainwright her name in her handwrit-
ing and my name in mine it was the first
token of our betrothal its a silly story
about a girl that runs away with a rascal


the railroad mans magazine

she was reading it about the time you came
in view it didnt take long for me to show
her just what you must be but you didnt
show her yourself until to-night clever
you are

  it was my idea-and i got it from
the book-to have her pretend she was
running away from you because you hap-
pened to have the clothes the manner and
the influence up there at the school so theyd

  the towerman gradually had driven him
 to the window

  mr wainwright called across the room
 in a whine of fear and hopelessness

  evelyn are you going to permit this
 the girl had fallen on a chair her
 arms and head lay limp on the table it
 seemed as though she had fainted

  coo determined his eyes missing no
 shade of movement or expression in mr

j

let you take her walking in the grounds
clever you are but not clever enough

   do you think im going to believe
this tommyrot mr wainwright asked
why ive written her-ive seen her-
ivc-

   stop shes my promised wife ferris
growled  i know all about you and ive
told you all im going to say you can go
the ladders your way and you came in here
by force like a burglar go the same
way

wainwright the towerman forced him down
the ladder he even showed him the cour-
tesy of holding a lantern

   ill get you for this  mr wainwright
cried hoarsely  and inside of twenty-
four hours

  follow the track straight to dunston
ferrisreplied imperturbably theres a
train to new york at midnight but keep
an eye out for the presidents specialp it
passes here in ten minutes

  mr wainwright was about to say some-

shoot now odds are even
for the heart of evelyn

thing but the figure of a man loomed up
abruptly before him and he started away on
a run

  it was charley lennox who with his
wife had driven out in his buggyin an-
swer to the message ferris sent when mr
wainwright first appeared in the tower

  what did you bring laura and me
all the way out here for he called up
to the window  say was that a yeggman
jim

   something just as good charley wait
a minute and ill let you up

  lennox shouted  whats all the mys-
tery about jim

  but ferris had stepped back and hur-
ried to the inert figure at the table he laid
his hand gently on her shoulder and the
girl sat up and stared about her uncom-
prehending then she began to weep

   please dont cry he pleaded  i had
to do it i had to do it telephone your
father right away and explain things
please stop crying it tears me all to pieces
miss day you can go right back to
school with charley lennox and his wife
shes a nice woman and-will make them
understand there im awfully sorry i had
to say all those things to get him away but
see what a fix you were in

   and-and-well i do really love you
and i have since you were here that day
and forgot the book the other girls forgot
things too-handkerchiefs and a parasol
i sent those things back but i kept the
book and wrote my name in it though i
never thought to see you again why i
even read tlrrft fool story and i never read
anything but law books and railroad things
because you see im studying im glad
i read it now it helped me to guess about
you when you came

  she stood up and faced him he could
make nothing of that sad expression

   youve done everything for me she
said  and i cant tell you what i- she
stopped and the tears came anew

  his eyes flashed will you tell your
father about me sometime he asked
 if he saw me perhaps-please look at me
or i cant say it

  she cast her big dark eyes sparkling
with tears honestly timidly upon him

  he opened his lips but his voice had
left him then he stammered nervously
 i cant say it at all i guess and taking
her hand he kissed it reverently

  she still allowed it to rest in his clasp
as they walked together to the door to admit
lennox and his wife from below

waiting for news of a wreck

richard boydsten until recently an
operator at tunnel the next station above
palisade colorado ordered physicians and
wreckers to take care of the dead and injured on
denver and rio grande passenger train no 
which for thirty minutes he believed he had sent
over the mountainside near debeque with a con-
sequent loss of dozens if not hundreds of lives
has given up telegraphy for good

  boydsten has auburn hair and although it has
not changed color he declared that he would have
sent a bullet into his brain when he learned of
his error had he had a gun

   i realized almost immediately after the pas-
senger had passed tunnel what i had done says
boydsten  i had orders to hold the east-bound
passenger for a freight which had just passed de-
beque i forgot to deliver the order to hold no 

   i knew that it would result in the worst
wreck in the history of the road for the two
trains were bound to meet on the hill in the canon
i called debeque hoping against hope that the
freight had not passed out of the yards but was
too late

  i have read in magazines of the awful experi-

ences of operators who had made just the mistake
i did but i dont believe they tell half the awful
feeling a man has who thinks that he has sent a
hundred passengers to certain death

   i prepared for the worst sent an order to
grand junction for a wrecker and asked for a
dozen physicians then i waited i could not
leave the key to look for signs of a burning wreck
for the despatcher kept asking for particulars

   finally when i felt certain the wreck had oc-
curred i looked in the drawer for a gun intending
o kill myself but it was not there and i decided
to await the inevitable just then debeque called
and said the freight-train had backed into the
yards closely followed by the passenger

   it seems the reflection of no s electric head-
light was seen by the engineer of the freight just
as he was approaching the steepest down grade in
the caiion

   he thought at once something was wrong
reversed his engine and stopped the train within
a short distance of the passenger had he gone
over the brink of that hill no power on earth could
have stopped his train and many lives might
have been sacrificed

good old days
railroading

  f-

    -

 by samson d platt

few stories can lie so interesting to railroad men of to-day as those of
the early days of railroading back in the three decades from  to
 during which time the railroad both in england and america went
through the stages of superstition abuse political objection and the calumnious
interference of those who looked upon it as the convolution of a diseased mind

    such stories and facts as those which mr platt has gathered here and
which charles frederick carter told in  early railroad days in new eng-
land  in our november number are both startling and laughable truly the
 greatest industry in the world  had some queer and thrilling moments before
it reached the plane of peace and perfection

stories of the days when stephenson was considered a nuisance and
when going aboard a train was declared as unsafe
as being fired from a cannon

ack in  it took our great-
  great-grandfathers three days to
  stage it from new york to
  philadelphia and under wash-
  ingtons administration two six-
  horse coaches carried all the
  passenger traffic between new york and
  boston-six days each way

  it was a long step from this to the over-
land travel of half a century later the
first great transcontinental stage line and
probably the longest continuous run
ever operated was the butterfield south-
ern overland mail its route was two
thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine miles
from st louis to san francisco it ran jar
to the south through el paso yuma and
los angeles to avoid the snows of the
rockies

  for this tremendous distance its schedule
time was at first twenty-five and then twen-
ty-three days its record run twenty-one
days its first coaches started simul-
taneously from st louis and san fran-
cisco september   each was

greeted by a mighty ovation at the end
through fare one hundred dollars gold
letters ten cents per half ounce the equip-
ment consisted of more than one hundred
concord coaches one thousand horses five
hundred mules and seven hundred and fifty
men including one hundred and fifty
drivers

  it began as a semi weekly stage but was
soon promoted to six times a week the
deadly deserts through which nearly half
its route lay the sand-storm the mirage
the awful thirst the dangerous indian
tribes and its vast length - forty per
cent greater than that of any other stage-
line in our history-made it a colossal un-
dertaking and the name of john butter-
field will always be remembered as one of
the americans who helped to win the west

	miles in  days

  this southern overland mail was
operated until the civil war utterly pre-
cluded mail-carrying so far south and the


in the good old days of railroading



overland had to be transferred to a shorter
northern route where it took its chances
with the snows the first daily overland
stage on the central line left st joe
and placerville simultaneously july 
 and each finished its two-thousand-
mile trip eighteen days later

  over one hundred thousand emigrants
crossed the plains from  to  there
is no tally of the freighting enterprises that
sprang up on the heels of this vast migra-
tion by the sixties five hundred heavily
laden wagons sometimes passed fort kear-
ney in a day in six weeks in  six
thousand wagons each with from one to
four tons of freight passed that point

  the height of prairie freighting was the
period from  to  its climax was
from  to  the floating popula-
tion then on the western plains was nearly
 in  over  pounds
of freight were shipped from atchison alone
requiring  wagons and  mules
 oxen and  men

  the firms engaged in carrying freight
were many their men an army their cat-
tle a host one firm russell majors 
waddell employed  big wagons and

	oxen this may give some faint
idea of the mighty traffic in the early days
when the frontier was a baby

train of prairie schooners

  the standard organization of such a
train was twenty-five of the huge long-
geared prairie schooners flaring from the
bottom upward and sometimes seventeen
feet long with six feet depth of hold and
capacity of from  to  pounds
each-each with six to twelve yoke of oxen

  the men of the outfit were a captain or
wagonmaster his assistant a night herder
a driver who had charge of the riding
horses and a driver for each wagon

  the ox-drivers were universally known
as  bull whackers and their beasts were
bull teams

  the huge  conestoga  pittsburgh or
 pennsylvania  wagons cost  to 
each mules  to  a pair harness
 to  to the ten-mule team-a total
of  to  per wagon besides sala-
ries provisions and incidentals a first-
class freighting outfit on the plains half a
century ago cost as much as an up-to-date
vestibuled passenger-train of to-day

  the largest train ever organized was that

  of general custer in his  campaign
he had over s six-mule teams single
file they reached four miles

  the establishment of regular freight
caravans from the missouri river westward
greatly reduced the cost of transportation
and developed business and immigration
in the days of pack-trains it was no uncom-
mon thing to pay  per pound per 
miles or  per ton per mile there have
been regular tariffs much in excess of this
but this was common everything went by
the pound the trip took twenty-one days
for wagons drawn by horses or mules five
weeks for ox-teams

records of the pony express

  the quickest time ever made across the
continent by the butterfield stage line was
twenty-one days its schedule for mail
from new york to san francisco was
twenty-three days the pony express more
than cut this in half not only did it
never once fail to span the transcontinental
desert in ten days it more than once sur-
passed any other courier record in history
buchanans last message was carried by it
from st joe to sacramento  miles in
seven days and nineteen hours and the
news of lincolns election was carried 
miles in two days twenty-one hours it
hustled lincolns inaugural across the
-mile gap in seven days and seven-
teen hours this is still the worlds record
for despatch by means of men and horses

  there have been times when a railroad
train could not reliably cross the continent
as swiftly as did the best of the centaur-
mercuries organized by that typical fron-
tiersman alex majors who died about ten
years ago

  in his youth majors made the broad-horn
record on the santa fe trail-a round trip
-with oxen in ninety-two days later he
took up government contracts and in 
was using over  large wagons merely
to transport government supplies into utah
employing there  men  mules
and more than  oxen

when holladay was king

  between leavemvorth and denver ma-
jors had  mules and fifty coaches
the first of these horse-power pullmans
reached denver may   six days for
the -mile journey horace greeley


the railroad maxs magazine

henry villard and albert d richardson
were passengers the holladay  liggett
stage line from st joe to salt lake had in
ss frittered twenty-two days in its semi-
monthly trips majors cut the -mile
run to ten days with a coach each way daily
the stage from denver to salt lake had a
run of over  miles without a single town
hamlet or house on the way

  by  there were no less than six mail
routes to california but ben holladay was
king no other one man anywhere has
owned and managed a transportation sys-
tem at once so vast and so difficult he
had sixteen first-class passenger-steamers
plying the pacific from san francisco to
oregon panama japan and china at
the height of his overland business he
operated nearly  miles of daily mail--
stages with about  freight wagons

	horses and mules and a host of oxen

  on the main line he used  horses
and mules and  concord coaches it
cost  for the harness the feed bill
was  a year to equip and
run this line for the first twelve months
cost  the government paid
holladay a million dollars a year in mail
contracts in  grain was worth twen-
ty-five cents a pound along the line and
hay up to  a ton in one day dave
street contracted at st louis for seven
missouri river steamers to load with corn
for the overlands army of mules and
horses

  ben holladay was the overland king for
about five years beginning in december
 the indian depredations of -
 greatly crippled his stage line nearly
all the stations for one hundred mites being
burned his stock stolen and his men killed
the loss was upward of half a million in
november  he sold out the overland
stages to wells fargo  co in whose
hands the romantic enterprise continued till
the railroads drove the stage from the plains
forever

odd happenings  years ago

  the year  was an odd one in the
railroad world and here are some of the
things that happened

  the directors of the lake erie and mad
river railroad company meeting at ur-
bana ohio announced their determination
to build thirty miles of road the ensuing
spring

  an advertisement of a house for sale in
maryland gave the location as  ellicotts
mills  miles from baltimore upon
the baltimore and ohio railroad where all
cars to and from the west stop to breakfast
and dine

  a letter of william h seward whig
candidate for governor of new yorkcon-
taining strong expressions of friendship for
the new york and erie railroad was in-
corporated into a political hand-bill and
widely circulated as a campaign document
the democrats denounced the letter and its
author thusly  in the north and along the
canal seward is opposed to the railroad
which he represents as a rival work de-
signed to divert business from the canal in
the south his letter is to gull the people into
his support by his professions of friendship
for their interest

  the new york papers containing the
election results of the city and vicinity
were placed in philadelphia in five hours
by the camden and amboy railroad the
 extras  were taken by steamboat to am-
boy there transferred to the train carried
over the fifty-six miles of the road to cam-
den terminus and finally loaded upon a
horse which brought up in the quaker
city the speed on the railroad was about
thirty miles an hour

car fell between rails

   an accident that will puzzle modern rail-
road men befell  the locomotive engine
augusta near windsor soutli carolina
with a train of twenty cars loaded with cot-
ton three of which were ahead of the loco-
motive and the remainder in the rear says
the report from some occurrence the
foremost freight-car fell in between the
rails and of course forcing the following
two down with it before the locomotive
could be possibly sopped she was precipi-
tated upon the freight-cars and one loaded
car immediately behind was drawn down
the engineer was fatally injured

  during the year ending october  
 barrels of flour were announced as
reaching baltimore over the lines of the
ohio railroad it was predicted that
when the road is opened to harpers
ferry which will be in about a fortnight
from this time the supplies will receive a
gradual but steady augmentation from the
shenandoah valley

    a bill for the opening of a  continuous

caught in the rope



    an engineer lost his life through the ex-
 plosion of the boiler of an engine that was
 conveying a train of burthen-cars near
 baltimore on its trial under the manage-
 ment of its builder preparatory to an ac-
 ceptance on the part of the baltimore and
 ohio railroad evidently the builder got
 disappointed about the acceptance

    one of the first violators on record of the
  dont-aiight-while-the-train-is-in-motion 
 rule was a citizen of lowell massachusetts
 who in making his premature jump got
 entangled in the rope and fell across the
 rail

   a new jersey newspaper computes the
 number of passengers carried during 
 by the railroad of that state-the camden
 and amboy-at  against 
 of two years before

    indeed during the last few weeks
 said this journal  the crowd traveling
 daily has been almost too great for comfort
 and convenience in another year a sin-
 gle line of railroad will be insufficient to
 transport the vast number of persons seek-
 ing- transportation between new york and
 philadelphia

   while laying the rails of civilization
 through the then unsafe territory between
 washington and baltimore two pioneer
 superintendents of construction were slair
 by robbers eighteen miles outside the lat-
 ter city

    the opening of thirty-two of the proposed
 forty-two miles of die boston and worces-

 quet by the directors of the line cars

     	rr

were regularly running twice a day from
boston to westboro and it was estimated
that  a day was realized from passen-
gers and freight

  a detachment of militia left baltimore
for the scene of a railroad riot in anne
arundel countv maryland on november
 

   things were a little better a quarter of a
century later in -s

  the right to use steam within the brook-
lyn city limits expiring in april  cars
to be drawn by horses were ordered con-
structed for the brooklyn central railroad
company line on atlantic street it was
proposed to extend the horse railroad to
east new york and then use steam to
jamaica

  a wandering ox caused the death of
eleven persons and the injury of twenty-six
in a railroad accident near watertown wis-
consin the animal was crossing the track
when caught by the cowcatcher of a passing
train and carried a dozen rods when it fell
under the locomotive which was traversing
a bridge over a small creek the locomo-
tive was instantly precipitated into the
creek the baggage-car and five passenger-
coaches following it

early rescue from cowcatcher

  that railroad men who from the cow-
catchers of racing locomotives rescue care-
less children on the track are not essentially
present-day products is attested by this
item in a pennsylvania newspaper

    as one of the freight-trains coming east
rounded a sharp curve near barree siding
a station about twelve miles west of hunt-
ingdon the engineer saw a small child sit-
ting in the middle of the track playing un-
conscious of its danger he instantly whis-
tled down brakes and reversed his engine
but the weight of the train and the high
speed at which it was running rendered it
impossible to stop before reaching the child
in the emergency when most men would
have stood paralyzed with horror daniel
mccoy the conductor of the train ran to
the front of the engine ran down onto the
cowcatcher and holding to it with one
hand leaned forward as far as possible and
when he approached the child with a sweep-
ing blow of his free arm threw it off the
track the train was immediately stopped
and on going back the child was found ly-
ing at the foot of a small embankment

twenty feet from the track but slightly
stunned and bruised

  under the headline  quick time from

  we received yesterday saturday
afternoon files of the mobile alabama

thence to oxford cairo chicago detroit
niagara falls and albany to new york-

 miles by steamboat a total distance of
 miles which was accomplished in 
hours

an armed posse

  signs of trouble between eastern and
western railroads were reported two
new york roads withdrew from an agree-
ment which fixed the winter passenger rate
from new york to cleveland at  the
two dissenting roads made the fare -
but a half-dollar above the summer rate

  the baltimore and ohio railroad sent
an armed posse to harpers ferry the scene
of john browns capture a few months be-
fore to guard the bridge and property of
the company at that point

  the directors of the baltimore and po-
tomac railroad announced that they were
confident of the success of their projected
work and were making every exertion to
forward its commencement

   southern planters were informed that they
could send their cotton to the atlantic sea-
board by the illinois central and other rail-
roads running east from chicago at a cost
of s per bale as against  per bale
cost via new orleans and the sea it was
also pointed out that the new rail routes
were thrice as speedy as the old means of
transportation

   the first train over the victoria bridge at
montreal carried several directors of the
grand trunk railroad and made the pas-
sage in twelve and a half minutes

  the case of george c bates against the
illinois central railroad in the united
states court involving the right of the de-
fendants to their depot property in chicago
was decided in favor of the road this
was the second time the case was tried with
the same result

  it was stated that the remaining three-
fifths of the required quarter of a million
dollars had been raised in louisville for the
southern pacific railway and that mr

thompsons acceptance of the presidency
and the immediate extension of the road
was thereby assured

railroads declared ridiculous

   as to those persons said the quarterly
review of london in  who specu-
late on making railways generally through-
out the kingdom and superseding all the
canals all the wagons mails and stage-
coaches post-chaises and in short every
other mode of conveyance by land and by
water we deem them and their visionary
schemes unworthy of notice every par-
ticular project must stand or fall by its own
merits and we are greatly mistaken if
many of those which are already announced
will not when weighed in the balance  be
found wanting the gross exaggerations
of the powers of the locomotive steam-engine
or to speak in plain english the steam-
carriage may delude for a time but must
end in the mortification of those concerned
what for instance can be more palpably
absurd and ridiculous than the following
paragraph in one of the published proposals
of what we should call a hopeless project

  the scheme here alluded to was laying
down a railway between the metropolis and
woolwich in which it was considered that
 twice the velocity  of the coaches might
be attained combined with  greater safety
the anticipation that by the agency of
steam travelers would some day proceed
 at the rate of four hundred miles a day
with all the ease we now enjoy in a steam-
boat but without the annoyance of sea-
sickness or the danger of being burned or
drowned called forth the indignation of
the reviewer

four hundred miles a day awful

   but with all these assurances he adds
 we should as soon expect the people of
woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off
upon one of congreves ricochet rockets as
trust themselves to the mercy of such a ma-
chine going at such a rate

  a rumor that it was proposed to bring
such a thing as a railroad within a dozen
miles of a particular neighborhood was
sufficient to elicit an adverse petition to the
british parliament and a subscription to
oppose so fearful a nuisance the london
and birmingham line was thus compelled to
change its intended route through north-
in the good old days of railroading



ampton and to keep at a respectful dis-
tance lest said some of the worthies of that
town the wool of the sheep should be in-
jured by the smoke of the locomotives
though they burn coke and therefore-
philanthropic souls-they required that
the purity of their fleeces should be pre-
served unsullied from the plutonic cloud
by giving the benefit of it to the farmers of
blisworth and its neighborhood this
argument is somewhat enriched by the re-
membrance of the fact that northampton
was chiefly known as a large boot and shoe
manufactory

  nor would those seats of learning ox-
ford and eton permit the great western
bill to pass without the insertion of special
clauses to prohibit the formation of any
branch to oxford or of a station at slough
while it was declared by the authorities of
the school that anybody acquainted with
the nature of eton boys would know that
tliey could not be kept from the railway if
it were allowed to be constructed

  when the directors subsequently attempt-
ed to infringe the conditions with which
they had been bound by only stopping to
take up and set down passengers proceed-
ings were commenced against them in chan-
cery and they were indicted

he hated the word

  while one of the first railroads of great
britain was being experimented an army
officer assured the house of commons that
 railways were dangerous and delusive
speculations that such schemes were
dangerous delusive unsatisfactory and
above all unknown to the constitution of
this country and that he hated the very
name of a railway-he hated it as lie hated
the devil

  when the london and birmingham line
was proposed a whole chorus of voices
shouted objections or uttered withering
sarcasms on the project it was declared that
it would be  a drag on the country  that
its works would soon be ruins for the an-
tiquary to study and that every hill and
valley between the two towns would behold
falling arches and ruined viaducts

  others declared that canals would soon
attain such efficiency that railways would
be superfluous that the charge for transit
by the canals would be far less than by their
rivals and the speed very much greater

medical men asserted that the tunnels

would be peculiarly dangerous in produ-
cing colds catarrhs and consumption and
that the deafening peal the fearful gloom
the clanking chains die dismal glare of the
locomotive and a thousand other horrors
which they vividly depicted were so alarm-
ing that such inventions ought to be utterly
repudiated

  but the people were not to be fooled by
such cobweb ideas and in spite of all ob-
jections the railroads began to find many
promoters these men especially in eng-
land pictured the possibility of get-rich-
quick schemes diat many people were going
bankrupt to secure shares

the share holders

   every man of the present day said a
facetious writer seventy-five vears ago  is
a holder of shares in a railway that is he
has got some pieces of paper called scrip
entitling him to a certain proportionate part
of a blue red or yellow line drawn across
a map and designated a railway if the
colored scratch runs from south to north
it is generally called a trunk-line if it
 turns about and wheels about  in all di-
rections leading to nowhere on its own ac-
count but interfering with every railway
that does ten to one but it is a grand junc-
tion and if it lies at full length along the
shore it is a coast line trunk-lines are
generally the best because the word trunk
naturally connects itself in the mind of the
public with the idea of luggage and a good
deal of traffic is consequendy relied upon
grand junctions are good speculations as
troublesome customers likely to be bought
off by larger concerns which would con-
sider them a nuisance and as street nui-
sances generally expect a consideration for
moving  a grand junction may ask a
good price for taking itself off from an old
established company

  one of the earliest writers had this to say
about engineers the italics are ours

  the duties devolving upon the engine-
driver are very peculiar and important it
is not merely that he has to regulate the
working of an elaborate and costly machine
and to remember as a general maxim that
accidents are to be avoided but he has to
be perfectly calm under circumstances al-
ways trying-to act with decision under exi-
gencies which may arise at any moment-to
discover expedients in unexpected difficul-
ties-and as an incentive to the discharge


the railroad mans magazine

of these duties he has to remember not only
that valuable property is under his care but
that often very many lives are entrusted to
him while should any inadvertency arise
his own would be the first to be sacrificed

thirty miles an hour

   while the train rushes forward whether
on the brink of some lofty embankment-
over the seemingly frail fabric of the wooden
bridge-beneath the earthy walls of the cut-
ting or within the bosom of the embank-
ment there stands the driver with his as-
sistant and as the hand of the former rests
on the governor of the engine lie regulates
the agency by which he is borne along

   when we are seated by the rosy christ-
mas fire and hear the sleet rattling against
the window or when the freezing blast
howls eager for entrance round the dwell-
ing in which the family group is collected
we sometimes think of the hardy sailor who
rides the stormy ocean but the railway en-
gine-driver is often forgotten

   yet his position is truly remarkable
even on a bright sunshiny day and at a
moderate speed the work is not for those
who have very delicate nerves the writer
has tried it and found thirty miles an hour
to be vo despicable rate of travel for as he
rushed on he began in some measure to
realize the statement of the sailor who af-
firmed that he was once in a gale of wind
in which it blew so strongly that a man who
happened to yawn with his face to wind-
ward was obliged to turn round to leeward
before he could close his jaws

best view from tender

  the writer ascertained also that mere-
ly standing on the engine was not an easy
position and required some practise to be
habituated to it and hencer-on more than
one occasion a seat on a chest on the top of
the tender lias been found to be preferable
while from the summits of embankments it
afforded an admirable opportunity of sur-
veying the surrounding scenery from which
the  inhabitants  of carriages are debarred
but to see the engine-driver when enduring

the cold that is produced in winter by evapo-
ration from his drenched clothes or as the
gale sweeps over the land in one direction
and he dashes through it at the rate of thirty
miles an hour in the other is to witness
a strange struggle

   yet on he goes-the fearful responsibil-
ity under which he is placed keeping his
attention undiminished whether by day or
amid the blackness of a wintry night-
rushing down steep gradients backed by
perhaps thirty passenger-carriages each
weighing on an average five tons and a
half-skimming along the summits of the
loftiest embankments and on the edge of
precipices at the foot of which roll the broad
and heaving billows of the ocean-or pene-
trating tunnels whose darkness can scarce-
ly be distinguished from the impenetrable
gloom by which he is elsewhere surrounded
-and searching with straining eyc-bam for
the signal that tells him he may proceed or
the gleaming blood-red light that forewarns
him instantly to stay his course under peril
of immediate and utter destruction

without embarrassment

   if an engine could go without any em-
barrassment through the fourteen-inch wall
of a camden engine-depot as has been twice
the case if in an ordinary accident happen-
ing to a luggage-train near loughborough
the wagons overrode each other till the
uppermost one was piled forty feet above
the rails if a train often has a momentum
equal to that of a cannon-ball flying
through the air of some ten or twenty tons
weight then a train like that described
would pass through a row of houses if
placed in its way like a musket-ball
through a keg of butter while if directed
by any accident against solid rock such
as is sometimes to be seen at the entrance
of a tunnel the result would be too fearful
to conjecture but we need entertain no
morbid anticipation of such catastrophes

  our forefathers saw wonderful things
but what can equal the notice posted in a
maine station in  stating the boston
express would depart at two oclock in the
afternoon weather permitting
scales that weighed not

by sumner lucas

               a story of a million dollars a coffin
               a red-headed lawyer and a thief

was raining that night in chi-
cago when an automobile rolled
up to the station a few mo-
ments before train time and
three men alighted and hurried
to the express-car

  all wore long rain-proof coats buttoned
tight they had pulled down their hat
brims to keep the driving drops out of
their faces one man walked rapidly
ahead carrying a suit-case and close behind
him came the other two with their hands
in their pockets on large-caliber pistols

  in the suit-case was  in cash
for a btank in a certain western city

  that bank needed the money in a hurry
-needed it desperately-for a line of
frantic depositors three blocks long had
besieged its doors for three days crying for
their money

  the money was taken to the express-
car and locked in the safe by the messenger
jim harrison he did not know what
was in the suit-case and the three men
did not think it necessary to tell him
they merely told him to lock it in the
safe and then handed him a ten dollar-
bill on general principles

  then they betook themselves to the sleep-
er soon after the train pulled out they
turned in for the night

  no one but the bank officials in chi-
cago and the three men in the sleeper knew
what was in the suit-case so this method
of carrying money was thought by them to
be the best way and the safest

  in the safe were also several shipments
of currency one in particular for 
that another bank in the same town had
ordered by telegraph as a precautionary
measure it had given the widest possi-
ble publicity to this shipment

  as the automobile pulled away from the
station an undertakers black wagon drove
up hurriedly its wet sides shining in the
electric lights

  the burden taken from that wagon caused
men to raise their hats even in the pouring
rain it was a coffin in a wooden box con-
signed to st louis it was placed in the
same baggage-exptess car

  accompanying the body was j c jack-
son a wealthy chicago grain broker

  as mr jackson entered the sleeper he
shook hands with two of the men who were
the custodians of the money the men said
nothing-they were friends in a way-and
all chicago knew of the death two days
before of mr jacksons mother and also
knew that he was taking her body to st
louis to place it in the family vault

  the train pulled out through the wet dis-
mal night and silence brooded along the
rails except for the jar and jolt and the
occasional whistle of the engine which
sounded into the very heart of the sleepless
men back in the sleeper

  at daylight the western city where the
bank was located showed through the drip-
ping car windows and the three bankers
cashier morrison and mead and smith of
the chicago bank left the train and went
forward to the express car

  then came a thunder shock the suit
case containing  was gone
gone also was all the other currency in the
safe gone also was the messenger there
was nothing in the car but ordinary express
matter baggage and the lone coffin in its
wooden box

  this in a nut-sjiell is what ruggles had
to work on when the case was laid before
him an hour later by the three bankers

  mr jackson went on to st louis and


the railroad mans magazine

placed the coffin now taken from the
wooden box in the vaults of the family
undertaker until the funeral which would
take place the next day at three oclock

  before mr jackson left the undertakers
parlors he took one fleeting glance at the
cold gray face under its waves of white
hair through the glass of the coffin

   that fool messenger has tried to get
away with that money he is an idiot he
will be caught before night but how about
the bank meanwhile what a fool what
a fool said cashier morrison excitedly
while ruggles one of the sharpest young
lawyers in missouri scratched his wiry red
hair and twisted his long thin legs

   there is nothing to be done till we get
the messenger he said quietly  i think
it will come out all right probably before
noon dont worry

  dont worry man thats very easy
for you to say it is not your money
hotly replied the cashier while the other
two stood dumb and hopeless

  the loss was on morrison and it was
little of their affair as they had come along
merely as confidential guards still they
were eager also to see the thief caught

  no its not my money you are
quite right said ruggles  but i happen
to have every cent i have on earth in your
bank and if it fails i will be financially
ruined so we are in the same boat

  hallo my boy what news he
added as a messenger handed morrison a
telegram

  morrison read it at a glance then yelled
theyve got him theyve got him
caught him in his own home right here in
town hurry lets get to police head-
quarters it is only six oclock and we have
four hours yet till the bank opens the
four men morrison mead smith and
ruggles went to police headquarters here
they found the messenger jim harrison
wild-eyed and dazed shivering with fright

  morrison would have leaped upon him
with clutching fingers but for the restrain-
ing hand of the chief of police

  give me that money give me that
money give me that money gasped
morrison as he struggled with the chief and
glared at the shrinking messenger

   all of you please leave the room for a
moment said ruggles quietly the chief
insisted and ruggles and the messenger
were alone

   how about it my boy  asked ruggles

have a cigar oh yes better take one
thats right now tell me all about it

   messenger harrison looked at ruggles
for several moments like a frightened girl
then calmed down as ruggles continued to
smoke slowly and to look out the window

    there-there is-nothing to tell har-
rison ventured in a choking voice  i-i
made-i made my run as usual and when
we were just pulling in here i saw that the
money was gone also that suit-case those
men gave me-

   what was in it asked ruggles casu-
ally

    i-i dont know i was talking about
the money that is gone it was there only
a little while before so i dont remember
much clearly after that i know i un-
fastened the door and jumped out as we
slowed up and i remember being home
then they came and got me halted the
messenger

   you unfastened the door of the car
was the money there at your last stop
questioned ruggles easily

    yes it was all there i looked to see
after we pulled out from the last stop and
everything was all right there was no
one else in the car that is what frightened
me so nobody but a-a-gh-ghost
could have done it-you know-oh  the
messenger collapsed in a faint

   it took the police surgeon half an hour
to bring morrison out of his faint

  the unhung thief hell be lynched
when the news gets out  raged cashier
morrison

   the news-wont get out you keep still
if you hope to get that money back not
a whisper remember to any one that
boy did not take it he is telling the truth
said ruggles then he related to the others
what the messenger had told him morrison
at first scoffed angrily but as the others
seemed doubtful he slowly quieted down
and assumed a puzzled expression

    if youll leave this matter to me
said ruggles ill get the money and
the thief but just when i cannot say
you gentlemen attend to raising more
money for the bank you have three hours
yet and there is a good machine at the
door that can do seventy miles an hour
one hundred thousand dollars will hold
off the run to-day if you pay out slowly
from one cage and meanwhile you can get
more money from chicago

   then ruggles went to breakfast while
scales that weighed not



the other three acted on his suggestion about
raising the money at a nearby city to tide
over the day eventually the bank was
saved about noon that day the run sud-
denly melted away the messenger was
kept locked up under the care of three
physicians nobody was allowed to see him
save ruggles-and ruggles did not go near
him

  that morning about two hours later
ruggles took a small suction carpet sweeper
and went in an automobile to the yards
where the express car was side-tracked

  the contents had been transferred to an-
other car as the car always ended its wes-
tern run making the return run from that
point to chicago

  ruggles with his own hands carefully
swept the floor the inside of the safe and
everything else in the car then he placed
these sweepings in a bottle which he sealed
and labeled

  this done he picked up a part of a plug
of chewing tobacco looked at it for a min-
ute smiled carefully wrapped it in his
handkerchief put it in his pocket and re-
turned to his office

  on the way he stopped at harrisons
home and after a search of the messengers
room he took a sheet off the bed cut a
hole in it the size of his two hands and used
the bit of cloth to wrap up several pieces of
dried chewing gum he found in the waste
paper basket

  mrs harrison the messengers young
wife was too worried over her  husbands
apparent trouble to notice ruggless absent-
minded way of getting a piece of cloth in
which to wrap the gum when he might have
used a piece of paper just as well

  however ruggles did see the messenger
once more that day he called about noon
to ask about his health and to bring him
some fruit a few cigars and some chewing
gum

  thank you murmured harrison i
dont use tobacco but ill take the gum

  ruggles stalked from the police station in
a brown study then he turned back and
again questioned harrison 

   did you for a single moment leave the
safe between the last stop and the stop
here  he asked

  why-er-no yes i did too i was
in the wash-room for perhaps ten minutes
getting cleaned up as we were running in
the messenger remembered

  that boy is telling the truth muttered

ruggles to himself  the thief was in that
coffin im going to st louis ruggles
did go to st louis he called on mr jack-
son and delicately made the request to see
that the body in the coffin was really a
corpse mr jackson was inclined to be
indignant but a natural worry led him to
accompany ruggles to the undertaker
there they looked at the thin gray face
under the white hair of mr jacksons dead
mother

  the dead was left alone in the under-
takers room with other silent dead and
ruggles left st louis sadly puzzled

  he returned to his home city and was
sitting moodily in his office by nightfall

   lets see muttered ruggles time after
time perhaps morrison and the messenger
stood in with each other and are working a
game i dont like the excessive way mor-
rison has of wanting to caress the messenger
every time he sees him by trying to choke
him to death looks a bit over done

  then too how do i know if there was
a million in that suit case have only the
word of three men for it and they might
steal it between them with the messengers
aid but there is the other  package
that is gone also

   harrison says he is sure the car was
empty except for himself at the last stop
that the doors were fastened tight from the
inside till he himself undid them to get out
before the train stopped as it pulled in here

   jackson and his dead mother are above
suspicion for ive seen the old ladys face
myself well it will all come out in the
wash for it is a scientific impossibility to
maintain a lie indefinitely either verbal or
acted then ruggles went to sleep

  the next day he took the train for chi-
cago with the aid of the police and liberal
use of tips he secured a record of all the
jewelry fur and automobile sales for that
day-and for every day to come until he
was done with such information at two
oclock that day he received a telegram from
the railroad authorities saying that three
pieces of hand-baggage were also missing
from the express-baggage car the own-
ers had presented checks for them but the
baggage was not in sight

  again that night ruggles sat long lost
in thought finally he shook his red head
and went to bed next morning on looking
over the paper he read that the funeral of
mrs jackson had been postponed for two
days because the ship on which her daugh-


the railroad mans magazine

ter was expected from europe had been de-
layed one day in reaching new york be-
cause of an accident to the engines

  then he took up the list of the sales-
telephoned to the police a soon as made-
and centered his attention on three in par-
ticular

   ten thousand dollars worth of dia-
monds dark man small looks like italian
speaks with accent seal skin cloak seal
skin overcoat silver gray fox muff nine
hundred and fifty dollars also small dark
chap with an accent and a woman with him
this time and whats this french car
twelve thousand dollars to the same chap
my dear sir im sorry to annoy you but
well have to find where you got all that
money maybe you are all right-and
maybe not well see

  with a search warrant ruggles and
three officers in plain clothes suddenly
swooped down on the apartments of mr
and mrs p jaun romanda in one of the
best of chicagos hotels

  they found only quantities of expensive
clothing furs new baggage and cigars

  however ruggles took with him the low-
er sheet from the bed in the pocket of a
sweater he found a small metal tobacco tag
from the piece of the plug he had found in
the express car the tag had been extracted
the find fitted the place exactly

    id give a dollar for a look at that chaps
teeth ruggles remarked to himself but
to the officers he said notiiing  a million
is a whole lot of money and if these fly
cops know too much they may sell out to
the other side

  then he said to the officers there is
nothing doing here lets go sort of a
wild goose chase call it off and forget it
ruggles went straight to his hotel and was
alone for two hours at the end of that time
about two oclock in the afternoon he tele-
graphed to his home city to the chief of
police

   quietly search town and see if a small
   dark italian has been seen there since the
   robber also locate his room and seal it
   tight till i get there keep harrison alone

                                ruggles

   then he swore out a warrant for the arrest
of one john doe alias p jaun romanda
within an hour that sputtering little game-
cock and his wife were in separate cells in
chicago police headquarters romanda
however had the best lawyers that money
could hire and was soon free

   his freedom lasted five minutes only
he was rearrested by the united states offi-
cials as a european criminal who had no
right in the united states this charge
held fast in spite of lawyers and ready
money yet romanda demanded a hearing
and promptly got it next day

   he demanded to know the evidence that
connected him with the express robbery

   ruggles laid it on the table in the shape
of several pieces of cloth and some small
bottles

    if your honor or any one whom your
honor will appoint will examine these
pieces of cloth he will see on them scales
from the human skin i have here a micro-
scope of ten thousand power i also have
a sample of the dust taken from the express
car from the room this man occupied in
this city from a room he occupied in the
city where the robbery was discovered-
when he was operating under a false name
-and i have also a sample of the dust taken
from the attic of the home of mr jackson
the samples all show the same scales from
human skin

    of course there are many other scales
from other human skins but the scales
from this man romandas skin are in all
the bottles and on all the pieces of cloth

    we have looked up his record by cable
and we find that he is one of the cleverest
convicts that ever escaped from an italian
prison he is a cabinet-maker by trade
and the son of a wig-maker he is small
in person you notice and is highly educated
in science

    in his rooms i found this old sweater
which is the one he wore on the day of the
robbery there are shreds of black silk on
it these traces of silk you may see for
yourself under the microscope your honor
they are the same kind of silk that coffin
makers use to line coffins the coffin in
which was supposed to be the body of mrs
jackson really contained this criminal it
was his method to get into the express car

    your honor i protest against any such
nonsense being given in this court as evi-
dence against my client mr romanda it
is utterly idiotic a man could not live ten
minutes in a coffin with the lid screwed
down and that coffin was inside a strong
plank box with the top fastened down with
screws it is absurd your honor thun-
dered the lawyer for the italian

  how about that mr ruggles the
coffin was not disturbed apparently and you
scales that weighed not	

do not claim that this man had any ac-
complices do you asked the judge

  no sir answered ruggles calmly
as i have said this man is a cabinet-
maker we expect to show how he entered
the house of mr jackson the night before
the body of the old lady was shipped how
he tampered with the clasps of the coffin so
that even if the lid was screwed down
tight it could be lifted from within clamps
screws and all in one piece

  we also expect to show how tins man
very cleverly bored holes in the outer box
just where the screws would go that held
down the lid and how he inserted corks in
these same holes the corks being concealed
by a thin shaving of wood glued down in
other words when the coffin lid had been
screwed down tight and when the coffin
had been put in the box and the lid
screwed down tight both lids could be
lifted off by a live person inside the coffin
and that is just what he did

  the body of mrs jackson never left
chicago and we found it last night con-
cealed in the attic of mr jacksons home
the head was shaved also the eyebrows
and eyelashes and a wax cast had been
taken of the face and throat we even
found the brushes he used to paint his wax
face

  we have located the store where these
were bought this week in this city we
have witnesses who recognize this italian as
the man who bought them he was wear-
ing this sweater at the time also he was
short of money during the past month he has
been in chicago till three days ago since
then he suddenly has thousands to spend
we expect to prove- 

   just a moment please mr ruggles
interrupted romandas lawyer  can i
and my client have a short private talk with
you-with the courts permission of course
your honor

  the judge was willing ruggles ro-
manda and his lawyer were taken to a
private room

  romanda confessed he told where the
suit case with its  was hidden in
a certain safety deposit vault in chicago
and with it the package for 

  some  already spent for jewels
furs and automobiles which were returned
to the dealers and the money regained from
them was not in the box but all else was
there and safe

  the italian took a twenty-year sentence

for robbery in america rather than go back
to italy and face death for killing two
prison guards

    i hear about the fifty-thousand dollars
romanda said during his confession i
hear about the death of mrs jackson and
i hear they ship body in same car i find
that out i plan to get in coffin and at right
time get out and kill messenger take fifty
thousand dollars and jump off i make en-
trance to jackson house i steal body in
night and take it to attic i shave head
make wax face put on hair and dress i
fix coffin and box lids i get inside with
oxygen in metal case to breathe by like coal
miner i put wax mask over my face i
breathe oxygen when lid is screwed down
but only for half an hour going to the train

i also have with me a small steel jack-screw
to raise lids i do so on train and watch
messenger all night through crack under lid
of coffin box he go in wash-room i get
out of coffin put in three pieces of baggage
to give weight arrange wax mask again and
fasten down lids then i take suit case and
money package i know money in package
but have no time to see what is in suit-case
-but i take it anyhow i hide behind
trunk

   but how did you get out of the car
ruggles asked him

   messenger go from wash-room to safe
look in go crazy look all around very
quick look at coffin open car door and
jump off i jump off too in few minutes
train is beginning to stop i walk up street
like any passenger and take room in small
hotel then come to chicago no hide
no one suspect me there look everywhere
but under their nose and romanda
laughed scornfully

   then ruggles sent this telegram

   release harrison money found

                                 ruggles

   in telling the story ruggles said

    the scales from no two human skins
are alike the method i used was like fol-
lowing a fox that had stolen a chicken i
merely looked for feathers and fox hairs
when the tracks failed to show as soon as
i had compared that sheet from romandas
bed with the dust in the express car and
safe i knew i had the right man the rest
was merely a matter of detail that mans
fate balanced in scales too small for the un-
aided human eye to see but the microscope
made them clear

an ohio locomotive with ah its energy behind its mighty drivers and
no hand to hold it in check careers on
a mad joy-ride

             all the adventures with wild
engines that railroad men of
the middle west recall
there is none more thrilling
than the runaway of the
 cut loose from its
passenger train in a collision at a cross-
over its engineer and fireman hurled to
the ground the heavy locomotive ran for
miles through the network of railway tracks
in the heart of youngstown imperilling
lives and property until it was halted by
a switchmengine that inadvertently hap-
pened to be in its way

  it was a few moments before 
oclock at night when the first of the series
of remarkable accidents occurred west-
bound pennsylvania passenger-train no
 was waiting for its signal to proceed
at what is known as the crab creek cross-
ing of the erie railroad a short distance
east of the city at this point the tracks
of the erie the pennsylvania and the b
and o interlace and there is no little con-
fusion of tracks switches and crossovers
an engineer named cummings was in
charge of the  which was pulling the
passenger-train

no time to stop

  cummings received his signal to go
ahead and the heavy train moved down to
the crossover it was running perhaps
fifteen miles an hour when it reached the
erie tracks

  just as no  was squarely on the
crossover a drag of cars was pushed out
of the bessemer yard of the republic steel
company it struck the passenger-train



between engine and tender cut the coup-
ling and hurled engineer cummings and
his fireman to the ground before they
had time to stop their engine the rest of
the train came to a sudden standstill but the
great locomotive sped on down the track
with no mans hand to control it the
shock of the collision had thrown the throt-
tle wide open and with every turn of her
drivers the old  went faster and
faster there was no longer a heavy train
to hold her back or the steady hand of
cummings to turn her power to service
rather than destruction

         into the citys heart 

  scattered here and there in the yards
scores of men were at work and shifting
engines were busy on the sidings with
hot coals glowing through the cracks in
the fire-box which had been broken by the
force of the collision and a cloud of sparks
pouring from its stack the runaway engine
dashed through the yards the men on the
shifting engines could only cling to their
seats and hope that the track was clear
while those  foot scattered wherever they
could for safety

  workers in the steel mills which line
the right-of-way at that point heard the
unfamiliar roar of the runaway and ran
to the fences they caught a glimpse of a
swaying engine obscured by a cloud of
hissing steam and spouting fire but even
before they could make out what had hap-
pened it was out of their range of vision
and rushing straight into the heart of
youngstown

  under the market street viaduct which
the spree of old 



crosses the tracks the wild locomotive
dashed at a terrific rate witnesses of the
engines escapade estimating its speed at
from seventy to ninety miles an hour
though it is probable that the lesser of these
estimates is somewhat exaggerated

  when the engine passed beneath the via-
duct it was rocking violently and seemed
to be in danger of jumping the track it
was here that the cab loosened by the shock
of the collision and the constant swaying
was shaken off and fell in a heap beside
the track as it did so it jerked back the
whistle-cord and a shrill uncanny scream
rang out until the rope parted a horse
and buggy were on the spring common
crossing and a crowded street-car had stop-
ped but a few yards from the track when
with a roar and a flash the runaway en-
gine shot by it missed the horse and
buggy by a few inches and it was a mere
chance that the car was not on the cross-
ing at the time

a freight ahead

  the usual evening crowd had gathered
at the pennsylvania depot to await the ar-
rival of train no  about the time it
was due they were amazed to see the 
bearing down upon them breaking all run-
ning-rules of the youngstown yards the
headlight was swaying from side to side
and steam hissed from the battered boiler
as the heavy locomotive took the curve at
the station her drivers biting into the rails
and throwing out a steady stream of sparks

  though it had not been many minutes
since the passenger-train was cut in two at
the crab creek crossing messages were
flashing all along the line for every one to
look out for the runaway one of these
came to telegraph operator ormsby in
the b-y tower at mosier in the outskirts
of youngstown and sent the color flying
from his face a freight-train had just
passed the tower and ormsby knew that
unless the wild locomotive was stopped the
caboose of the freight-train would be tele-
scoped and the crew would in all likeli-
hood be killed or injured

  he ran from his office to a switch leading
from the main line to a cinder dock along
the river and with all the speed at his com-
mand he threw the lever that would either
dump  into the river or hurl her from
the track

the runaway engine never reached the

switch however at the austin town cross-
ing a yard engine was leaving the upper
carnegie mills with a drag of cars similar
to the one which had turned loose the 
on her wild career the switchman was in
his shanty watching for number  which
was about due ancl-kad the semaphore set
for the switch-engine to clear the crossing
when suddenly he saw the locomotive come
staggering down the track

  if engineer cummingss hand had been
at the throttle the block would have served
its purpose to old  however it meant
nothing she shot past the block and the
switch shanty and crashed into the switch-
ing engine with a roar that operator orms-
by heard as he stood sweating at his switch
at the b-y tower

  the yard engine was struck in the side
hurled from the track a distance of forty
feet and turned half around the engineer
and firemen were thrown from their engine
by the shock but neither was fatally hurt
old  jumped the track righted herself
and running a short distance along the
ground stopped within twenty feet of the
yard engine she had wrecked

  the switchman had run out of his shanty
and was not thirty yards away when the
locomotives came together showers of
gravel and fragments of iron fell all about
him and he was knocked down by a heavy
piece of packing from one of the boilers but
escaped with but a few slight injuries

called for his engine

  the crowd of men and boys who had been
attracted by the news of the first accident
found engineer cummings cut and bleed-
ing running uncertainly down the track
after his runaway locomotive he was
crazed for the moment and called continu-
ally for his engine after he had been cared
for at the hospital and his mind had cleared
he said that he was conscious of but one
thought after the crash at the crab creek
crossing and that was to get to his engine
and stop her at any cost

  thus the spree of old  as rail-
road men call it terminated more fortunate-
ly than might have been expected how
it was possible for the great engine to make
such a run through the maze of tracks and
yards of a busy railway city without
the sacrifice of a single human life those
who are familiar with the accident find it
hard to explain
the aerial mail

by lydia m dunham oneil

surly simmons declared that  old black lulu  was
the only thing on wheels - and he meant it

          y and by surly they wont need
you nor your lulu any more
k theyll have air-ships to carry
m the mail an express an then
its  old black lulu  to the
scrap-shop an you to high-
land park surly simmons an ill be sit-
tin in one o them air-ships all dressed up
in goggles an gloves an things steerin the
aerial mail an lookin tony aw say now
surly that bolt like to clip me on the
head dont be so reckless throwin things
around like that as i was sayin-

  shut up you thick-head you you
couldnt steer a hand-car an there wont
be no aerial mails in my time cub let
em run all they like when im under the
sod-but not in my time

  but surly was perceptibly disturbed by
the idle banter to which he was being sub-
jected daily  old black lulu officially
known as engine  was his darling
he abhorred electric locomotives automo-
biles gasoline launches air-ships - any-
thing and everything that was not run by
steam-power

   old black lulu  was good enough for
him he said  old black lulu  and the
drag of express and mail cars she carried
were good enough for anybody

  simmons did not know that the big trunk-
line was already contemplating the building
of a few air-ships for the purpose of convey-
ing mail and express or his mind would
have been still more troubled it was ru-
mored that the continental air-ship com-
pany was in the process of formation and a
continental -air-ship line would mean more
speedy deliver of mail and express cheaper
rates and therefore considerable pecuniary
loss to the railroad company this threat-
ened competition must be met and defeated

so while simmons growled and swore the
railroad company planned and experi-
mented

  by and by there came a young english-
man from the other side of the atlantic
with a little money in his pocket and a
grim determination to earn more - much
more by night he dreamed of cogs and
wheels and screws and propellers and dy-
namos and ohms and volts and the wins

                                        o

of birds by day he worked on these dreams
and made them come true

  he didnt want to become famous he
wanted to marry but he hadnt sufficient
money and no influential friends

  one day his dreams and his labor came
to an end that was the day that his small
model of the fenimore-stokes air-ship was
finished tested and found perfect 

  then fate brought him into contact with
hendricks the recently elected president of
the never-mind-what railroad company
hendricks wanted an air-ship and feni-
more-stokes wanted money each supplied
the others demand fenimore-stokes sold
his patent outright and went home to mer-
rie england and his sweetheart

  hendricks went his way rejoicing in the
knowledge that he had secured the means
to combat the continental air-ship com-
pany which was still non-existent

  the never-mind-what company built
two large air-ships after the pattern of the
fenimore-stokes model and then hastened
to build more because firstly the conti-
nental air-ship line had become a reality
and secondly because of two daring mail
and express robberies which occurred only
four or five weeks apart and defied solution

  five mail-clerks and three express-mes-
sengers had been found dead in their cars
with their skulls crushed a sixth mail-
the aerial mail



clerk died without regaining consciousness
and a fourth express-messenger became so
hopelessly insane that no clue could be ob-
tained from his confused incoherent speech

  all the most valuable express packages
were missing boxes broken open and safes
dynamited in the mail-cars not one regis-
tered letter or parcel had been overlooked
in both instances no -drawn by  old
black lulu with surly simmons at the
throttle-was the train selected by the ma-
rauders it hurt simmons more than any
one knew but that did not mend matters

  the n-m-w company decided then to
convey express and mail by means of the
fenimore-stokes air-ships so they broke a
bottle of wine over the gray metal body of
the first man-made bird and christened her
the registered mail the second they
named the chicago express

  when he heard of it surly simmons broke
two bottles of wine over  lulus  black
nose saying to her  if you aint worth two
o them flying-machines then you cant run
two miles in four minutes

  lulu assuredly could run two miles in
four minutes but she sighed nevertheless
and her iron heart throbbed convulsively

  the  registered mail  made three trial
trips between her terminals--new york
and a town half-way between the eastern
and western coasts-safely and speedily
on the fourth day she started west with her
first cargo of express and registered mail at
the rate of three hundred miles an hour

  only recently had the air-ship been util-
ized for practical business purposes and
heretofore two hundred miles an hour had
been the maximum average speed attained
in the matterof speed as well as safety
and simplicity the fenimore-stokes model
had proven superior to all competitors
the aviator in charge of the registered
mail  boldly asserted that the ship was
capable of twice the speed at which she was
permitted to travel but the n-m-w com-
pany was content with three hundred miles
an hour-content to run two daily air-ships
-the mail and the chicago express

  side by side stood  old black lulu 
and the registered mail side by side
stood president hendricks and engineman
simmons the old engineer was no longer
surly but sad he spoke in a voice half
choked with sobs

   your pa wouldnt a done it mr hen-
dricks your pa was a railroad man from
way-back an he wouldnt a done it you

can fire me for that if you like its said
an i aint a goin to take it back

  his intense sadness and resentment were
almost comic hendricks laughed a little
and tried to jolly the old engineer but
simmons was in no mood for jesting

  he turned away oiled the  wiped
her carefully with a handful of clean waste
and polished her as vigorously and uncon-
cernedly as if the  registered mail  were
no more than a summer shower

  but hendricks heard him murmur once
or twice they dont want us any more
 lulu they dont want us any more

  by and by simmons walked over to the
air-ship and examined her carefully no
chance of a break-down i spose he
queried hopefully

  no chance whatever smilingly an-
swered the aviator simmons looked about
to see if there was anything with which he
could tamper-a bolt he could loosen or a
screw he could remove but there was noth-
ing besides he would have been detected

   lectricity too he growled  gaso-
line was bad enough but lectricity

  he turned away and climbed into the
cab of the  he carried baggage and
passenger-coaches for the first time in many
years and a feeling of shame stole over him
as he gazed at  old black lulu  and the
string of cars behind her

  it had all come so sudden-like only
a few days ago it seemed air-ships were
only toys at which he had laughed yet
one of those toys had supplanted his  lu-
lu -and there she stood flaunting her tri-
umph in his face-the blue-gray hulk three
times as large as the largest car he had ever
hauled and carrying his precious freight-
his express parcels-his registered mail

  old black lulus days of glory were
over-and so were his alas how bitter

  no  counted off the miles as she al-
ways had  old black lulu  puffed and
whistled and clicked and pounded over
the frogs just as she always had-and by
and by she started to sing a crazy little
song of her own composing

they dont-want me-any more-

they dont-want me-any more-

  simmons heard and understood-and an-
swered 

   youre right old girl they dont want
you any more  lulu  to the scrap-shop
an me to highland park


the railroad mans magazine

  in a short time they passed the ninetieth
mile-post and simmons began to look for
the registered mail somewhere along
the line she would cross the n-m-w
tracks headed directly west she had no
signals to heed as lulu had no curves
to take or hills to climb she had it so easy
-all plain sailing for her

  she would cross the n-m-w tracks at
the bridge and sail away out of sight be-
fore no  could-

   the devil  the captain or motor-
man or whatever he called himself had
told him there was no possible chance of a
break-down and yet-

  the  registered mail was wabbling-
swaying - swinging she was going to
drop some one had blundered simmons
was not the man to let a golden opportunity
pass xot he swiftly he calculated the
distance to the point where the  registered
mail would fall and swiftly he jerked
the throttle open wide then he hooked
her up -gave her  the short stroke and
she responded

   lulu   lulu   he cried  you go

preserving ties

it is interesting to note the increasing use of
creosote for treating ties in this country the
process now largely in use is the rueping method
commonly known as  empty cell impregnation
whereby it is expected that a uniform distribution
of creosote can be made throughout the timber in
small quantity thereby greatly reducing the cost
of the materials used as compared with the full
treatment with creosote when the timber is al-
lowed to take in as piuch of the material as it can
hold by this old method of creosoting the tim-
lcr is first subjected to a vacuum so that when
the impregnating fluid is forced in il remains
there filling the cells by the rueping process
the timber is first put under air pressure sufficient
te fill all of the cells of the wood with air and
then the fluid is forced in at a higher pressure so
that after this pressure is released the expansive
force of the air throughout ihe interior of the tim-
ber will expel part of the fluid from the cells
thereby leaving the walls of the cclls merely paint-
ed with the creosote so to speak instead of filling
the ccll cavities this is ihe theory of the process
and from the fact that a much smaller quantity of
creosote is used than is the case when the ordi-
nary proccss is worked the facts seem to sub-
stantiate the theory

  in former years creosote was not seriously con-
sidered by railroad managements owing lo its
high cost now however the rueping creosote

to do it old girl work hard now-hard
hard hard  lulu old girl do your
blamedest go it  lulu  

  the short stroke won the day for  old
black lulu

  simmons leaned out of the window and
watched the air-ship anxiously

 down-down-down it dropped and
 old black lulu  plowed into its shiny
body just as it struck the bridge they
plunged into the river together-the reg-
istered mail  and her  crew and  old
black lulu with part of her drag
simmons still sat on the leather-cushioned
seat his greasy sullen face transfigured by
a triumphant smile

   old black lulu  was never sent to the
scrap-shop she lies there at the river-
bottom still hooked up covered with
mud and victory and surly simmons
never went to highland park for he lived
just long enough to say

   they can run all the aerial mails they
like when im under the sod-but-not in
-my time no  lulu -old girl-not-
in our time

with creosote

process is widely used throughout the country
both east and west and this progress lias- come
about within the past six years in  at the
st louis worlds fair the government exhibited
a tie-treating plant and at that time the rueping
process was just beginning to come into notice
at that time about the only processes that were
being worked extensively in this country for treat-
ing railroad ties were ihe zinc chloride and the
zinc tannin methods now however most of the
roads which were then treating with these cheaper
methods have gone over to the use of ihe rueping
process

  as staled al ihe recent roadmasters convention
by an official of that road ihe cost of treating in-
ferior pine ties with creosote rueping is twen-
ty cents the cost of zinc chloride and zinc
lannin treatments in years past has ranged from
eight to sixteen cents per lie but usually ten to
twelve cents of the zinc chloride processes the
straight zinc chloride is logically applied to tim-
ber in dry climates where there is but little water
to leach out the salts and the zinc chloride with
glue and tannip should be used in climates where
there is the usual amount of rainfall both of
these processes when properly applied have
given results well worth the while and have ef-
fected important economies in the consumption of
lie timber to maintain track-railway and engi-

minimizing the cost
of operation

by john walters

perplexing problems that have been solved by the american railway
association and others that are taxing the ingenuity
of the traffic department

the beef trust and the big brewers the total
was  the average daily earnings
of each of these cars was 

    this was far from satisfactory to the rail-
roads and during car famines such a show-
ing was still less satisfactory to the shippers
the great difficulty is to keep the cars mov-
ing the railroads get a movement aver-
aging from twelve miles per day per car on
single-track lines handling low-class traffic
up to thirty-eight miles a day per car on
roads having two to four tracks and hand-
ling a large proportion of high-class traffic
in other words the railroads obtain but
from one to three hours service out of their
entire car equipment in each twenty-four
hours

freight-car movements

    the average mileage of all freight-cars in
the united states for the year  was
 miles per car per day in  this
was increased to  miles per car per day
in december  the average had dropped
back to  miles per car per day the
worlds record for freight movement is held
by the pennsylvania railroad which in the
week ending september   handled
including the cars owned by other corpora-  cars and in twenty-four hours on
tions such as the refrigerator-cars owned by september   cars on the latter

series began in the august  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents



            fter all the one supreme rail-
                 road problem out of which
                 all other problems arise and
                 for whose solution only the
                 rest are studied is how
                 can dividends be earned

  for the answer to this question the stock-
holders look to the traffic department other
branches of the service by wise economy
may save money but only the traffic depart-
ment earns money or rather handles the
receipts which the concerted efforts of all
departments earn

  naturally the management bestows par-
ticular attention upon the traffic department
if comparisons are not too odious it may-
be said that the ablest men are generally-
sought for this branch of service and as the
difficulties are generally proportioned to the
prize the problems with which the traffic
men must grapple are at least as formidable
as those which confront the experts in
maintenance and operation

  as in the case of everything else con-
nected with a railroad the magnitude of
traffic problems would make them difficult if
nothing else did there were in the united
states on december   
freight-cars belonging to the railroads but

date the movement was equivalent to sixty
cars a minute passing a given point

  as an average of  cars a day are
loaded in the country an increase in move-
ment of a single mile a day for eacli car
would be equivalent to adding  to

	new cars to the available equip-
ment that number of cars would cost
approximately  how to get
this increased movement is a problem so
important that the american railway asso-
ciation composed of the higher executive
officers of the railroads has appointed a
committee on car efficiency to study it

how cars are delayed

  one great trouble is that the average man
to whom a car of freight is consigned feels
that he has an inalienable right to use that
car as a warehouse in which to store freight
until it suits his good pleasure to remove it
if it takes all summer theoretically the
railroads protect themselves against abuses
of this sort by charging demurrage when a
car is not unloaded within a given time but
if in practise they attempt to collect demur-
rage die consignee protests that he is down-
trodden and routes all his shipments over
the competing road forever after

  on the other hand if the railroads do
not get their cars released by enforcing the
demurrage rule other shippers who are wait-
ing to get those cars to load complain to
the state railroad commission that the com-
panies are playing favorites in the distri-
bution of cars and the result is more laws
the following winter from all of which it
may be gathered that the committee on car
efficiency has its work cut out for it

  however the task of the committee on car
efficiency is simple when compared with the
heart-breaking problem which confronts the
american railway associations special
commission on the interchange of freight-
cars the magnitude of the question may
be-judged from the personnel of the commis-
sion it was appointed in april  it
consists of president james mccrea of the
pennsylvania president lucius tuttle of
the boston and maine president w w
finley of the southern railway and presi-
dent howard elliott of the northern pacific

getting back the empties

  if no shipment ever went beyond the rails
of the road on which it originated the spe-

cial commission would never have been called
into existence but as car-loads and train-
loads go to all sorts of places and often
move over a number of railroads to reach
theu- destinations complications then arise

  nto one but the railroad pays for the haul-
ing of an empty car about the country at a
cost close to that of moving a loaded one
under these circumstances the line upon
whose tracks the car is unloaded would like
to have it reloaded with another cargo before
sending it back home

  as an inducement to keep the empty car
from waiting too long for a return load the
railroads have agreed to charge each other
fifty cents a day for a car that is kept away
from its home road if the per diem charge
was too small the little roads would find it
more profitable to retain the cars of the
larger lines for their own use and pay the
per diem rate but if it is too high the little
roads are threatened with bankruptcy

  some of them have found fifty cents a day
a ruinous price in these days of low rates
in any event the arrangement is unsatis-
factory all around the big roads want
their cars for they generally have use for
them and they dont care to pay the per
diem charge for cars of another line when
they have plenty of their own if they could
only get them

creators of traffic

  in april  only fifty-four per cent of
the freight-cars in the united states were on
the roads to which they belonged this
condition was so unsatisfactory that a special
effort was made to get cars back home by
the following december sixty-four per cent
of the cars were on their home roads but to
accomplish this result an unnecessary and
profitless movement equivalent to hauling
one car nearly five thousand times around
the earth at the equator was required

  it costs a lot of money to haul an empty
car  miles and the expense can-
not be collected from shippers but must be
taken from funds that the railroads would
prefer to devote to some other purpose and
all the great home movement of 
amounted to was practically an even ex-
change of cars

  none of these things however constitute
the crowning grievance of the traffic depart-
ment every railroad in the country has
as one of its most valued employees an
industrial commissioner whose duty it is to
minimizing the cost of operation



make ten car-loads of freight grow where
there was only one before

  when he has accomplished this by per-
suading capitalists that fortunes are to be
made in manufacturing along his line and
then locating them at points where they can-
not ship over a competing line if they wanted
to besides giving the farmers in his terri-
tory post-graduate courses in their own busi-
ness it becomes the privilege of the general
freight-agent to retain the traffic thus created
if he can and of the general passenger-agent
to round up the passenger traffic that follows
in its wake if possible

  it costs a pretty penny to keep up this
work of creating traffic but it comes the
nearest to being paid cheerfully of any
money from which a railroad company parts

    short hauls that cost dearly

  new yorks dray bill is  a
year a large part of which is practically so
much money thrown away if the traffic
manager could find some way to save part
of this his patrons would have just that much
more money time and energy to devote to
useful production which in time would bene-
fit the railroads another direct incentive to
simplify traffic conditions in the metropolis
is a little item of  a year which
represents the cost of lighterage and car-
floats for the railroads

  in chicago where conditions are not near-
ly so inconvenient and wasteful as in new
york a freight-tunnel system thirty-four
miles long was built under the wholesale
district at a cost of  in which

	tons of freight can be handled daily
at an enormous saving

 in st louis the famous cupples station
a central station which meets the warehouse
and shipping requirements of the citys great
trade with the southwest saves 
a year instead of hauling freight to a score
of widely separated freight-stations scattered
through the most inaccessible portions of the
city all merchandise is sent to cupples
station

  here in a series of buildings covering
thirty acres and well provided with spurs
switches and hydraulic lifts two thousand
expert freight-handlers handle a business
aggregating a hundred million dollars a
year without any expense at all for cartage
freight is unloaded from the car on trucks
which are run onto hydraulic elevators and
shot up to the floor-space allotted to the con-

    	r r

signee in wonderfully fast time each road
has its scheduled hour to take away and
deliver cars and the shipments are assorted
and handled by the station force to conform
to this schedule

switching by gravity

  even after a car is loaded it does not
cease to cause trouble and expense aside
from its actual movement on the road the
problem of switching has been the subject of
much learned discussion at recent railroad
conventions

  most big railroad yards have a hump
nowadays which does by gravity what the
switch-engine would otherwise have to do at
a vast expenditure of time and fuel the
hump is nothing more nor less than a little
artificial hill from the summit of which the
tracks lead down at a grade just steep enough
to make a car run nicely to the farther end
once a switch-engine gets a train on the
hump it need only give each cut the slight-
est of kicks and the cars will then run
by gravity wherever the switch-tender sends
them

  this is fine as far as it goes but the
scheme isnt perfect if the grade is steep
enough to make a car run ten miles an hour
by its own momentum which it must do if
the hump is to do its work economically
each cut must have a rider who by using
the hand-brake prevents it from running
outsat the farther end or smashing draw-
bars on other cars the speed with which
a train can be classified therefore is limited
by the number of riders available and the
zeal they display in getting back to the
hump for fresh cuts

powder magazines on wheels

  a switchman will run when necessary
but when it comes to walking while on duty
lie is no match for dan oleary so rail-
road officialdom is racking its brain for some
scheme that will make him step lively in
the lake shore yard at collinwood ohio
where a tremendous volume of traffic is
handled a trolley-car has been installed to
carry the fifteen riders back to the hump
the car travels eighteen hundred feet and
so saves the work of three riders or say
six hundred dollars a month on both night
and day tricks

  this is worth while but still there is
time lost waiting for the trolley-car so the


the railroad mans magazine

new york central will improve upon this
plan by installing a moving sidewalk to
carry riders back to the hump in its big
gardenville yard on the outskirts of buffalo

  of all the problems that any department
of the railroad has been called upon to solve
in recent years that connected with the
shipping of explosives is the most interesting
perhaps it is just as well that nervous pas-
sengers do not know that an average of five
thousand cars of the most dangerous and
deadly explosives are in transit somewhere
on the railroads of the united states every
day in the year

  accidents were frequent enough to worry
railroad executive officers but did not spur
them to action until may   on
that day a freight-train entering the outskirts
of harrisburg was flagged the engineer
applied the air-brakes so vigorously that the
long train buckled throwing two cars from
the middle of the train onto the west-bound
passenger tracks a passenger-train which
came along a moment later dashed into the
two-cars

  they were loaded with dynamite and in
the explosion that followed twenty-three per-
sons were killed and a large number injured

warning the shippers

  as a result of this accident the pennsyl-
vania railroad undertook to safeguard the
shipment of explosives over its own lines
after two years it became evident that the
work to be successful would have to be
national in scope so the subject was referred
to the american railway association for
action

  the result was the organization of the bu-
reau of explosives of the american railway
association with major b w dunn of
the united states army in charge four-
teen inspectors were appointed and the work
of educating manufacturers of explosives in
the rudiments of their own business and of
trainini the one hundred and sixty thousand
railroad men whose duties include the
handling of explosives to look out for cars
in bad order was begun

  at first the manufacturers refused to have
anything to do with the bureau of explosives
or to allow its inspectors on their premises
on the ground that the bureau was organized
in the interest of the powder trust for the
purpose of driving the smaller fry out of
business

so major dunn concentrated his work of

inspection on cars in transit and set system-
atically about gaining the confidence of the
manufacturers the conditions discovered
were almost incredible of  cars of
explosives in transit  were found to be in
a condition that would permit accident and
 failed to comply with proper regulations
in some respect

some terrifying discoveries

  for instance one car containing over two
tons of dynamite had cracks in the sides
roofs and ends through which sparks could
enter and the packages were loose so that
they could and did slip and slide about the
floor besides this some loose iron pipe and
wire cable were loaded in the same car
when two pieces of iron smeared with dyna-
mite are knocked together something is going
to happen

  another car containing  pounds of
dynamite had loose boards and cracks and
doors ajar for the admission of sparks
nails and bolts projected from the floor the
king-bolt sticking up half an inch the
boxes of dynamite were loose and sliding
about while one box had its lid knocked off
and the dynamite exposed to make it more
interesting blasting-caps and fuse were load-
ed with the dynamite in still another car
containing  pounds of black powder
some kegs were broken and the powder was
strewn over the floor while big cracks in the
ends and over the doors gave free access to
stray sparks of which there is always a
bountiful supply in the neighborhood of a
locomotive in action

  when diplomacy at last gained entrance
for major dunns inspectors to the factories
it was found that  out of  failed to
comply with important regulations while
 of the  magazines examined were
found to have dirty floors stained with nitror
glycerin and in fine condition for an
explosion

  in  of them packages of high explosives
were found in a leaking and dangerous con-
dition

  at last on january   major dunn
succeeded in getting the manufacturers to
attend a conference

an object lesson

  as soon as he got them together the major
marched them all down to a railroad yard
where cars with dummy packages represent-
when the dispatcher forgot



ing dynamite were knocked about by the
switch-engine just as cars handled in the
ordinary routine of business after an hour
or so of this the cars were opened and the
manufacturers were invited to examine the
condition of their contents

  what they saw made them quite willing
to comply with the rules that had been
formulated for loading and staying packages
of explosives and other regulations conducive
to safety

  yet in spite of the work of major dunns
staff there were  accidents to explosives in
transit in  which killed  persons and
injured  and caused the loss of 
worth of property in the same period there
were  accidents in factories for the manu-
facture of explosives in which  persons

were killed  injured and property worth
 destroyed

  there can be no doubt in view of the
revelations made by the inspectors of the
bureau that many if not most of those acci-
dents both in factories and in transit could
have been prevented by the observance of
reasonable precautions in view of the fact
that their own property as well as human
life was in danger it is certainly amazing
that all possible care was not exercised with-
out the intervention of the railroads

  yet manufacturers of explosives are only
one of the many classes of shippers with
which a railroad has to deal

  altogether it would appear safe to venture
the assertion that railroad executives have
something to think about besides pay-day

of the fifth section of train no  of which
i was the engineer on the south and north
division of the louisville and nashville
railroad running between birmingham
and montgomery alabama leaving the
former city that night we were given our
running orders as was usual together with
instructions that extra  north had the
right-of-track to longview over th no 
engine  with others this order was
issued some time before our departure

  north of longview there was a very
heavy grade and as the company had just

finished a new route circling the mountain
special orders had been issued stating that
the new route was to be opened as the
south-bound main line at ten-thirty oclock
that night up to that hour no train was
permitted to use the new track without writ-
ten instruction from proper authority

  as we had no such instructions arriving
at suluria the north end of the new grade
we kept to the old main line leaving that
station at  while the  was labor-
ing with her tonnage and slowly rounding
a sharp curve at the edge of a high cliff i
was horrified to see a headlight flash sud-
denly into view

  it was soon so close that i could easily
read the figures  on the number plate of
the fast-approaching locomotive i yelled
at my fireman to look out but there was no
time for either of us to jump and the en-
gines came together head on with terrific
force

  during the short period after seeing the


the railroad maxs magazine

opposing engine my mind moved very rap-
idly i tried to figure by what right the
extra was there and whose fault it was i
thought of my home of my wife and family
and wondered what in heavens name would
be my fate

  all i remember when the crash came
was a severe blow on the head that threw
me into a daze i could feel the hot es-
caping steam though for the time being
i was unable to realize my perilous con-
dition

   in a few minutes however i regained full
consciousness to find that i was pinned in
the corner of the cab bruised and bleeding
and apparently unable to escape as there
was no room to open the front cab-window
the tank being jammed tight against the
boiler-head

  my first move was to stop the escaping
steam by its peculiar odor i knew that
some connection to the lubricator was bro-
-ken and was fortunate enough to locate it
in the dark and shut it off this remedied
i crawled up on top of the boiler so as to
make room for opening the front cab-win-
dow

  by this time my conductor reached the
engine and called up to find out whether
the fireman and i were still alive one look
convinced me however that my unfortu-
nate companion had been killed and was
buried under the wreckage

  tony feagan the engineer on the other
engine and his fireman had jumped the
former striking a large boulder and break-
ing a few of his ribs while the fireman
escaped with a few bruises it was two
months before i could resume my duties
engineer feagan was off much longer

  our train had passed suluria and the
operator had reported us by when the des-
patcher called and asked him if th no
 was using the new track upon receiv-
ing the information that we were not he
instructed the operator to go out and listen

and report at once if he heard the impact
of the collision

  he immediately ordered out the wrecker
knowing that nothing short of a miracle
could prevent an accident as extra no 
had already passed longview having gotten
orders to suluria over th no  the tissue
reading th no  will use new main
line from suluria to longview

  it developed during the examination as
to the cause of the accident that the des-
patcher on duty not being able to get the
operator who had previously taken our run-
ning orders and the one giving extra no
 rights to longview issued another or-
der to extra  north conferring rights to
suluria over th no  trusting that he
would remember to have this last order
added to our original orders when we called
for them

  he took a chance disregarding positive
instructions and issued the order to the
extra forgetting to have it added to our
other orders when they were delivered to us

  at first there seemed to be a disposition
to put the blame on the operator and an
effort was made to make him admit that he
had been instructed to make this addition
to our orders but this he refused to do he
looked his questioners squarely in the face
and said

  this is a case of homicide in a way
and i am in no way responsible i have
nothing but my home but i will sell it that
i may raise funds if necessary to fight this
case in court rather than have the blame
fixed on me i never received any such
order for th no  these are his exact
words as nearly as i now recall them

  he was exonerated and put back to work
shortly afterward but the despatcher was
dismissed from the service it being decided
that even though he sent the order as he
claimed he did he had grossly violated
positive rules by not transmitting simul-
taneously the order to all concerned
the rollicking trolley-riders

by jack silverton

all the good stories of railroading are not necessarily confined to the big
steam lines now and then we get some live ones from the electric-
railway men who often have experiences quite as interesting as those
of the fast passenger and freight trainmen their work is not so full of thrill-
ing moments and deeds of daring as that of the regular railroad men never-
theless it is livened at times by incidents that give one a sort of live-wire tickle

some little comedies of street railway life in the west in which the
unexpected took the leading part and fate played
some odd pranks upon her victims

harley cannon worked
for years as a brakeman for
the denver and rio grande
railroad-out of denver-
without a single mishap then
came the day up on one of the
worst grades in the rockies when his freight
left the track and turned handsprings all
the way down into the valley

  while the freight was somersaulting down
the mountain cannon found himself lying
in the snow so badly smashed up that
wreckers had to carry him back to civiliza-
tion

  when he recovered he said to his wife
 im through braking its too hazardous
a profession im going to learn to be a
motorman and get a job on a trolley line
who ever heard of any electric railroader
getting smashed up no one ever gets hurt
on a trolley line excepting the passengers
who get off backward

  soon after this declaration cannon heard
that salt lake city wanted some new motor-
men forthwith he bought two tickets to
salt lake and with mrs cannon for the
first time in his life traveled on the d and
r g over the rockies as a passenger

  upon their arrival in salt lake city he
went straight to the car-barn of the utah
electric railway company qualified as a

motorman and was told to find a uniform
and get on the job quick

  for a whole year charley cannon ran big
suburban cars from the rio grande depot
out to fort douglas and daily he gloated
over the fact that now that he had stopped
braking he couldnt possibly get smashed
again

trouble on a trolley-car

  then came that memorable night in no-
vember  when his car on its way from
fort douglas to the rio grande depot
struck a down-grade where the motormen
usually coasted at about thirty-five miles an
hour cannon was going at the usual rate
when the car suddenly hit a rock leaped
from the rails and turned completely over
finishing its cavortings by landing on its
back

  the forward platform of the car rested on
one side of a small creek while its rear
platform lay on the other thus forming a
bridge within twenty-three passengers
lying in a mass on the ceiling of the car
squirmed and struggled and wiped their
feet on one another all bent upon getting
out of the wreck at the same time not a
single one of the whole twenty-three es-
caped without injury of some kind


the railroad mans magazine

  conductor hansen found himself lying
under five men who had been standing on
the rear platform suffering from a badly
bruised leg he allowed the five men to
walk on his face until they succeeded in
getting off the ceiling of the platform then
he arose and began the heroic work of as-
sisting swearing men and praying women
out of the car

  blood thereupon looked at hansen and
the trolley conductor looked at the steam
railroader then in unison they both
cried its charley cannon yes the
women are all out

  well then yelled charley from be-
neath the car you fellows come down and
get me im tired of lying in this ice-cold
bath

a misplaced motorman

   the wrecking crew arrived and a thou-
 sand spectators gathered to watch operations
 when suddenly above the cries of pain and

   blood and hansen plunged down the em-
bankment and found cannon lying sub-
merged in two feet of water with only his
head above the surface

 its the worst sprained
 ankle in the whole

vl ld

the screams of the lady passengers a pene-
trating voice was heard crying wheres
the motorman  wheres charley cannon  

  the speaker was william blood a rail-
road conductor with a run out of salt lake
on the salt lake los angeles and san
pedro railroad who was an old-time com-
rade of charleys in answer to bloods
question a voice from the darkness down in
the bed of the creek directly under the car
cried

   have you got all the women out 

rescued by conductors

are you hurt the conductors asked

  i cant move by my lonesome the mo-
 torman replied

 so the two concjuctors waded into the
 stream lifted cannon out of the water and
 dragged him up the bank four volunteers
 then carried him over to conductor bloods
 house which happened to be near the scene
 of the accident

two or three other victims had already
the rollicking trolley-riders



been taken there before cannon arrived
turning the house into a temporary hospital

  while the injured motorman lay awaiting
the coming of an ambulance conductor
blood came in

   where are you hurt old man   he
asked

  there answered charlie pointing to
his left foot  its the worst sprained ankle
in the whole world

what the surgeon found

  blood took hold of his friends left ankle
and looked mightily puzzled he then
squeezed the ankle good and hard saying
with a humorous twinkle in his eye  does
this hurt you charlie

  hurt answered charlie  its per-
fect agony 

  just then the ambulance arrived can-
non was put into it and was soon on his way
to the hospital with his feet close to the seat
on which the medical student on guard at
the rear of the vehicle was sitting

   you say you sprained your left ankle 
the student asked look here now he
added  does this give you pain   and he
squeezed the motormans left ankle as vigor-
ously as blood had done

  pain yelled cannon why im
nearly fainting from the torture of it
whereupon the medical students smile grew
until he couldnt help laughing out loud

  at the hospital cannon was placed ona
cot and soon the surgeon came and made an
examination of his injury

    its my left foot doctor he said  that
left ankle is sprained something terrible
im sufferin from that sprain worsen i did
in that freight wreck of mine in the rockies
on the d and r g

  the surgeon looked at him sharply and
then he too smiled and proceeded to bind
up the other foot

mixed in his understanding

  the next day conductor blood of the
salt lake-los angeles route and con-
ductor hansen of the wrecked trolley-car
happened to meet at the hospital whither
they had come to inquire into the condition
of the victims of the disaster of the previous
night

the surgeon who had dressed charlie
cannons foot greeted the visitors by saying

 queer case that of motorman cannon

ive seen cases like it before but never one
so pronounced as his he imagined he
suffered from a sprain in the left ankle
though such a thing was absolutely impos-
sible

   yes put in blood  i made the dis-
covery myself while charlie lay in my
house last night waiting for your ambu-
lance

  why whatever do you main asked
the electric railroader why do you say
it was impossible for charlie to suffer from
a sprain in his left ankle

   because he hasnt any left ankle at all
replied blood

   quit your kiddin expostulated the
trolley conductor

   you mean to say youve been trolleying
with charlie cannon for a whole year
hansen and didnt know he hadnt any left
ankle retorted conductor blood why
after charlies smash-up in that d and
r g accident over in colorado his left leg
was amputated below the knee his left
ankle is made of cork

from trolleyman to tourist

  one morning in may  two at-
taches of the kansas city union station
both of them sufficiently prominent to have
their names emblazoned on certain doors not
far from the concourse were standing by a
slot-machine enjoying an after-breakfast
smoke when charlie kelley came up

  making my last run to-day gents he
said  im leaving here to-morrow for new
york to sail for europe

  the officials were dumfounded

  kelley wore a uniform so faded diat one
was in doubt as to whether its original color
was blue or green on his cap was a sign
advertising the fact that he was conductor
for the street-car company of kansas city
his particular run being on the line that
hauled passengers to and from the union
station

   break it to us easy charlie said one
of the station-men  you mean to tell us
that you a man who hasnt spent a cent for
anything except necessities for so long as we
can remember are going to blow yourself to
a european trip

  yep answered kelley and my wife
is going with me

  you must have a pot of money kiid
the other station-man

 aint savin how much replied charlie


the railroad mans magazine

 but its enough to see the old country first-
class thats sure

  to appreciate the romance of the trolley
rails in which charlie kelley played the
hero we must go back to the day in may
 when he first pulled the bell and rang
up fares on a fifth street car that morn-
ing as he passed a certain house on fifth
street he saw a young girl standing in the
frontdoor

how kelly won his bride

  thinking that she wished to catch his car
charlie beckoned to her she waved a white
hand in response motioning him not to stop

  the next morning he saw that same girl
standing by her front gate this time
charlie smiled the girl returned the smile
and charlie caught a glimpse of a dimple
that aroused in him a wondrous admiration
for its owner

  the following morning when charlies
car approached the house the girl stood by
the curb and beckoned to the motorman to
stop he helped her aboard his heart beat-
ing at a dangerous pace and the blood suf-
fusing his face to such a degree that he
seemed threatened with apoplexy

  charlie finally learned that his divinitys
name was nina white and after she had
ridden on his car about six times a week for
two weeks lie mustered up enough courage to
ask if he might call at her house on his
evening off then on the last day of the
merry month of may nina white became
mrs charles kelley

  the honeymoon was still shining when
one day charlie asked his wife what she
would like more than anything else in the
world

a street-car strategist

   a trip to europe like our neighbors next
door have just made she replied

  how much did it cost them asked
charlie curiously

   three thousand dollars

  he thought a moment and then cried
nina you shall have that trip to europe

  mrs kelley protested she said she had
mentioned it only in fun and declared that
for them to raise three thousand dollars was
as absolutely impossible as for her to raise
the roof of their house with her bare hands
but charlie insisted there was no such word
in the dictionary as impossible and there-
upon outlined a plan by which they could

quickly accumulate the necessary three thou-
sand dollars

  well save it he said from this
minute well begin saving every penny

  soon after that charlies street-car com-
rades noticed that he no longer smoked
cigars he seemed terribly fond now of a
corn-cob pipe also they noticed that he
ceased patronizing the soda-water fountain
and the moving-picture show

  months years passed and charlie never
would get a new uniform till the old one had
been mended and patched to the limit of the
cloths endurance meantime living the
simplest sort of a life lie became the most
robust and healthy street-railway employee
in all kansas city his wife also grew
rosier and they both wore smiles that a
kansas cyclone couldnt tear off

  it was  the last day of may 
when he had been married just six years
that charlie kelley came to the two station-
men at the union station and for the first
time revealed the secret of his life namely
that he and his wife were going to europe

back from abroad

  six months passed then suddenly
charlie reappeared to the station men at the
union station wearing the same old faded
uniform and smoking the same corn-cob

   hallo mr rockefeller cried one of
the station-men youre back are you
tell us all about it

  charlie told them that all he saw in
ireland was rain and that in paris he ate
ice-cream three times a day and added
im going right up to the car-barn now
and ask for my old run

  what a rich man like you going to
conduct a plebeian gtreet-car  

   yep ive got to im broke spent
in six months all that i saved in six years
and am darned glad of it sos my wife
we bought something with our money that
no one can ever take away from us

when the foreman got busy

  one bitter cold night in february 
at the kansas city kansas street-car barn
foreman hovey was hugging the red-hot
stove when his telephone bell began ringing
so wildly and so alarmingly that hovey
upset his chair in springing up to heed the
call

 folio mr hovey said a breathless
the rollicking trolley-riders



voice at the other end of the wire this
is arthur haskell motorman on car four-
nine my conductor is lying on the floor
of the car dead to the world what shall
i do

   where are you   asked the barn fore-
man

  near the missouri pacific railroad
station

  wait right there haskell ill send
some one to take the dead one off your
hands

  foreman hovey then asked central for
a number

  that you coroner davis he said
when the connection
had been made  go
right down to the mis-
souri pacific station

a conductor of ours has
dropped dead youll
find him lying on the
floor of car four-nine

  hovey then called
another number and
cried  is that daniels
undertaker shop  hal-
lo mr daniels one
of our conductors is ly-
ing dead in his car at
the missouri pacific
station go right over
with your dead wagon
please

  fifteen minutes later
two vehicles were rush-
ing at fire-engine speed
toward the missouri
pacific station one
was a buggy with a
galloping horse the
other a long black
sinister-looking wagon
with its two horses can-
tering like mad both
vehicles dashed past the
mop station and on
down the road beside
a spur track till they
came to a lone trolley-
car

  out of the car as the
two vehicles came to a
halt beside it stepped a
man who shivered piti-
fully as he cried be-
tween chattering teeth

  whos here

   im coroner davis said the man who
had jumped out of the buggy  what hap-
pened to him apoplexy heart-failure
im daniels of daniels  comfort the
undertakers announced the man who had
jumped down from the long black vehicle
 this is our dead wagon he added
with the coroners permission ill take
the dead conductor off your hands

  as motorman haskell listened to these
words he stopped shivering his teeth
stopped chattering his eyes bulged and he
gasped who sent you here

  hovey the foreman at the car-barn
  well then you two go right home out

she waved in
motioning him
to stop


the railroad mans magazine

thank you madam said-the kid chivalrously

according to the rules

of the cold hoveys the emit i didnt say
nothing about the conductor being dead i
merely said he was dead to the world come
into the-car and see for yourselves

  the coroner and the undertaker followed
the motorman into number four nine

  well wherevi he get it asked the
coroner looking sheepishly at the prostrate
form of the conductor

   yes-where in this dry state of kansas
did he get it put in the undertaker

  say misters said motorman haskell
 you come over with me to the railroad sta-
tion i want you to call up that car-barn
foreman and let me hear you tell him just
what you think of him-for getting you out

of bed on a cold night like
this and sending you down
here on a fools errand
captain mcculloch a
confederate veteran and a
southern gentleman of the
old school is the president
and general manager of the
united railways of st
louis he wrote a man-
ual of good manners for
the guidance of conductors
on his lines and had it
printed and posted in con-
spicuous places at all divi-
sion - points it included
several rules w h i c h he
wished conductors to observe
especially in regulating their
attitude toward women pas-
sengers

   while giving courtesy
to all men the rules read
give chivalry to all women
be patient do not lecture
scold nor make the sharp
retort keep silent not-
withstanding there may be
provocation

    do not offend any wom-
an by word or act the rules
continued do not lay
your hands on a woman ex-
cept to save her from injury
do not have a woman ar-
rested do not contradict
her do not in any way
offer her an indignity

  now when most of the
southern trolley - riders in
st louis read these rules
on the big placards at divi-
sion-points they knew that a southerner
suh had written them and that a liberal
construction might be put on them when
a certaiii st louis united railway con-
ductor read them however lie recked not
that they were penned by a chivalrous sol-
dier from the south he merely understood
that they were the commands of captain
robert mcculloch the boss

   he with all the other conductors liked
the boss down to the ground because the
boss always gave everybody a square deal
therefore the conductor in question who
was known to his fellows as the  kid re-
solved to do his best to observe all the rulej
in the manual of good manners
the rollicking

trolley-riders



  one day not long after die issuing of die
manual the kids car was boarded by a
woman possessing the amplitude of propor-
tions of a leader of suffragettes she in-
sisted upon standing on the back platform

   pardon me madam said the kid for
the second time but will you have the
goodne to step inside

   how dare you speak to me like that 
screamed the woman and she swatted the
kid a goodly one on the weather side of his
face reddening his cheek to the hue of a
boiled lobster after which the lady
stepped inside

  when she reappeared on the back plat-
form to leave the car it was manifest that
her emotion had in no wise abated for she
again screamed how dare you and
again she swatted the kid this time on the
lee side of his face

  thank you madam said the kid
chivalrously according to the rules-as he
helped the lady of ample proportions to
alight from the car

   why conductor that was an outrage 
expostulated one of the men passengers
 why in thunder didnt you have her ar-
rested  

  arrest her replied the kid read
these rules he produced a pocket edition
of the manual of good manners

obeying the rules

   doesnt captain mcculloch say here
he continued pointing to the rule that
were to keep silent even under provoca-
tion  doesnt he say were never to cross a
woman in any way and above all never to
arrest her no sir if a woman commits
murder on this car she cant get arrested
except over my dead body its against the
rules besides a scene like that which you
just witnessed is part of the days work

   the true interpretation of chivalry is
that when a woman biffs you on one cheek
turn to her the other cheek to be biffed and
then more in sorrow than in anger give the
motorman two bells

  when captain mcculloch heard of this
incident he said that boy is a gentleman
suh im proud of his display of chivalry

  not long after that the clerk of the lost
and found department came to captain mc-
culloch with a handsome hand-bag which
he said had been found in one of the cars

   it looks like it belongs to some million-
airess e said and it feels as if it might

be full of dough so i thought it best cap-
tain to bring it to your personal attention
who found this reticule suh asked
the president and general manager

  the kid sir

   have the goodness suh to bring him
here when he comes in from his run
accordingly a little later the kid was
ushered into the presence of president mc-
culloch

the kid makes good again

   you found this reticule conductor
said the captain and i congratulate you
suh upon your honesty as i have before
complimented you upon your chivalry i
take it for granted that you suh knew that
this bag contained hundreds of dollars in
cash

  yes sir i opened it answered the
kid

  do you happen to know suh who left
it in your car  

  yes sir she was a stunner

   there there suh do not speak so of
a lady what sort of a woman was she
 a ripper sir a peach

  yes yes i know you would be able
to identify her should you again see her
suh

  among a million sir

  the next day a handsome woman su-
perbly gowned appeared in captain mc-
cullochs office at headquarters

   oh im so sorry you sent for me she
exclaimed  i would have let that bag go
and let the tinder have the money i would
have said nothing about it indeed

  i found your address-the hotel jef-
ferson-in the bag madam said the cap-
tain  i learned from the contents too
that you are from a certain mining town in
colorado where wealth is taken out of the
earth a ton at a time nevertheless it was
my duty to notify you that the part of your
wealth contained in this bag had been
found and it is your duty now to permit
me to restore your property to you

a generous reward

   but that honest conductor  the lady
cried  he must be rewarded opening
the bag she took out a roll of paper money
and peeled off three one-hundred-dollar
bills there she said give him
that


the railroad maxs magazine

  no no madam die captain protested
 it is out of proportion to the amount re-
stored besides so much money will do
that conductor more harm than good i beg
you to reward him with less or better still
merely with an expression of your grati-
tude

  no i insist the lady retorted here
you must permit me to give him at least-
that and she handed the captain a hun-
dred-dollar bill

   it is not within my province to protest
further madam though i repeat-it will
do the conductor more harm than good
that night the kids eyes grew as big as
saucers when captain mcculloch having
called him in handed him a hundred-dollar
bill

  be careful what you do with it cau-
tioned the captain  put it quietly away
suh controlling your impulses and remem-
bering that it is harder to stand up straight
under prosperity than under adversity

  the next day came a letter written on the
hotel jefferson note-paper it was signed
by the lady who had lost the hand-bag and
addressed to captain mcculloch it read
in part as follows

   i am not satisfied with the reward i
gave that very honest conductor i beg that
you ask him call upon me here at the hotel
this evening

  late that afternoon accordingly the kid
was again ushered into the office of the
president	

too much for the kid

  suh said captain mcculloch the
lady whose bag you found has requested me
to transmit to you an invitation to call upon
her at her hotel this evening i cannot re-
fuse a ladys request neither can you but
i warn you suh that she means further to
reward you

   it would not be chivalrous for you to
decline to give the lady the pleasure of giv-
ing money to you suh so i cannot insist
that you refuse what she offers what i
do say to you suh is that if chivalry com-
pels you to accept more money from this
lady be extremely careful as to your con-
duct after you leave the hotel remember
suh what i said to you before about con-
trolling your impulse

  three days later a division superintend-
ent dropped into captain mccullochs office
to say

  lost one of the best conductors on my

line

  who asked the captain

  the kid

   lost him  how suh  

    hes quit his job and the last i heard
of him he was still celebrating some good
fortune-we dont just know what any-
way hes going round town spending money
like a sailor after a cruise

  well suh exclaimed the captain
aint that just-a woman

   woman  replied the superintendent
 i said nothing about a woman

  yes i know suh nevertheless weve
lost one of our best men because of a wom-
ans doggoned emotionalism 

  captain  the division superintendent
cried with mock severity your own  man-
ual of good manners sir forbids you to
speak that way of a conductors sweetheart
i am profoundly surprised sir

the girl in the green dress

  for a long time motormen and conductors
in east st louis wondered why sam bix
the best-looker and niftiest dresser on the
line did not marry the girl in the green
dress

  sam bix was a motorman on the alta sita
division and she-she was called the girl
in the green dress because she happened to
wear that selfsame gown of green pongee at
every dance given by the employees of the
east st louis and suburban throughout the
entire winter social season of -

  sam himself said the dress made him
think of one of those green boxes of to-
bacco from richmond

   she never burned the tongue he said
 and her airs were as graceful as the smoke
that floated up from a pipeful of the said
tobac

when bix lost out

    well then why didnt you marry her 
sam was asked by one of his coworkers
 you sure kept company with her the whole
season you took her to all the dances up
to that night we gave the ball for the benefit
of the cherry mine sufferers after that-
say what happened that night anyhow
but sam bix the motorman would not
vouchsafe a word as to the cause of the es-
trangement between him and the girl in
the green dress it was months before he
at last volunteered the following
the rollicking trolley-riders



  well you see it was like this that
night at that dance i felt it in my bones
that it was nip and tuek between me and
me deadly rival that rah-rah conductor that
was as stuck on the girl as i was only he
was a strongheart and i guess i wasnt you
remember we called him the rah-rah con-
ductor because he had been in college once
as a dormitory janitor

   take me oath on
the night of that ball
that we gave for the
cherry mine victims i
knew it in me heart
that i must win her
promise to marrv me or
else the rah-rah con-
ductor would open his
yap and walk off with
her

  well she and me
danced a two - step

then off she glides into
a waltz with me dead-
ly rival gee but it
was maddenin to see
her smilin at him the
same way she smiled at
me-as she waltzed in
his arms round and
round the ballroom

   then it came my
turn for another two-
step with her

     this time i says
to myself  im going
to pop the question for
sure

   but round and
round we whirled and
me no nearer to the
point of popping than
at the beginning and
so it went on she dan-
cing first with me and
then with me deadly
rival and me all the
time tryin me best to rake up the nerve to
let out that i was dead stuck on her and
wantedthat her and me should announce
our engagement to marry

  well midnight comes and with it me
own turn to do another two-step with her
as i starts in i resolves that this time ill
pronounce meself in the very first time
around

  you think i got the chance when i was
plumb clean stronghearted and ready to talk

business not on your life just as we
got half-way round and just as i begins
the song and dance about her bewitchments
and about wanting to enter into partnership
in this here game of life presto the party
broke up

  broke up what for

our barn foreman comes rushin into

into the ballroom and
spreads the news in no

his conductor mike
obrien had been shot
and killed on their car
by a highwayman and

 there were no pas-
sengers on thd car at
the time fortunately
for the robber set the
car going and it ran
wild for four miles
into the outskirts of
town

   well sir our barn foreman calls upon
every man present at the ball to shake his
girl and get into a posse to catch the assas-
sin could i refuse to join em say what
you take me for gene and mike were
friends of mine and i was for chasin their
assassin and bein in at the landin of him
so right in the middle of that two-step
when the music stopped for us all to listen

the railroad mans magazine

back in two hours therell be a few men
left here-fellers that aint in the railroad
push will you wait here for me till two
oclock  

    oh  she says expectant-like  what
was it you were beginnin to say to me
samuel a moment ago 

    wait till two says i  and ill finish
that song and dance will you wait 
sure she answers ill wait till

a midnight man hunt

   with that i hastens away and looks
back and sees that rah-rah conductor-me
deadly rival-on the job i mean diat i
saw him lookin into die girls eyes and
playin the talk game for all he was worth
in the minute allotted to him before he had
to join the possemen

    wonder what hes savin to her  i
thinks but just dien he leaves her and
then the mob of us leaps to the chase led
by our barn foreman

  we scattered all over east st louis-
and finally i lost the bunch entirely and
conducted the search on me own hook two
oclock comes gee but i was sweatin
blood then i was miles from that ball-
room  would she wait  i wondered

    to hail columbia with the assas-
sin  i says to meself  im for beatin it
back to the ball

  well sir i reaches that ballroom at
exactly three-one hour late is the girl
there not sos youd notice her is any
one at all there not sos you could see
em-except the janitor who was a friend
of mine and to whom i savs

    jim did you happen to notice when
the girl in the green dress started for
home  

    sure  jim says  she left when all
the odiers left

     alone   i asks

    well now mr bix he says  in the
jumble of confusion attendin the departure
of the parties i cant be certain but i do
think that the girl in the green dress was
taken home by thatconductor whom you all
speaks of as the rah-rah and by the way
mr bix it was lie who caught the man
that killed those poor trolleyman to-night-
heaven rest their souls 

    oh  i exclaims  i had forgotten all
about the assassin so the rah-rah got the
assassin did he did you happen to no-
tice what hour it was when the rah-rah
showed up here  

    sure mr bix it was exactly two
oclock i see him go to the girl in the
green dress with his watch in his hand
and i see him point to the watch and say
something lowlike to her she looks
around at the door a moment-bless her
heart-as if maybe expectin to see some
one else come in but seein nobody she
nods her pretty head to the rah-rah and
takes his arm

  well there you are concluded sam
bix that rah-rah conductor had prom-
ised to be back in the ballroom at two he
was there on the tick and i wasnt the
rah-rah was there with goods both ways for
he got both the assassin and the girl in
the green dress dont ever say posse to
me it makes me feel awful disgusted
thats why im still a bachelor

the porter was greatly perplexed at high
polsover a lady with a lorgnette entered the

train

  she was a middle-aged tall angular tailor-made
woman rtid she looked sternly at the commercial
traveler in the seat opposite through her lorgnette
before seating herself she opened the carriage win-
dow and sent it down with a hang when the
train arrived at hilsdon cross another woman
entered the compartment

  she bad fluffy hair and an appealing look in her
blue eyes she sat down and glanced at the open
window and shivered pathetically then ihe looked
at the commercial traveler

  i shall be frozen to death cricd the fluffy-
haired lady

  if this window is closed i shall suffocate
cried the other woman

  the porter opened his mouth he started to
raise the window then lie retreated dazed he
turned appealingly to the commercial traveler
both the women also turned to the commercial
traveler that gentleman rose passed by the
ladies opened the door to the platform and went
out followed by the porter

   and what sir said the porter  would you
say as ow i should do sir

   its quite simple said the commercial trav-
eler  leave the window as it is open till one
lady is frozen to death then close it and suffo-
cate the other im going forward for the rest of

the sixty-hour trick

by george h fellows

              the particular brand of obedience that caused
              the frayed nerves of billy stephens operator

orking days now
billy

  does it look like
midnight to you get
something done for
your eyes if thats the
best you can do with your lamps

   oh you dont need to get so smart about
it i know its daytime now as well as any
ham operator on this road but when a man
condescends to ask you a civil question
why cant you stand the strain long enough
to answer it in a half-way intelligent man-
ner if your brains are too feeble ill put
it this way-are you on the day trick now
or are you just working for your health
yes im on the day trick and im on
the night trick too and if any idiot of a
brakeman tells you its for my health send
him to me

   is jim laying off 

    sick so he says

  did you work yesterday

  you bet i did and the night before
and last night and to-night and to-mor-
row and so on for the next two weeks un-
less he gets back or this old half-baked
excuse of a road hustles around and hires a
few more operators

  youve been on duty forty hours now

and no relief in sight yet well youre a
bigger fool than i gave-you credit for and
thats going some billy why dont you
go home  

  maybe i wouldnt like to jim no-
body knows better than i that im taking
a long chance on getting into trouble but
old hale says he hasnt got a relief man
in sight and dont know where he can spare
an operator at any price and i hate to be
a quitter jimmy may be back in the morn-
ing and illtry and stick it out but say
id give my next years pay if i could lay
right down now and sleep and sleep-oh
gee 

  jim barclay conductor of train  look-
ed the speaker over for two or three min-
utes before answering

  son if i was on a passenger train due
to go through your block about two to-night
id get off and walk i dont object to bein
killed when my time comes but i aint
wishing it to hurry none if youve got
any sense and want to save yourself from
an interview with the grand jury and a few
hundred ghosts in the near future id ad-
vise you to go home and go to bed to-night
even if you have to lock the office and make
everything flag through

  too much switching and other things


the railroad mans magazine

here old boy to talk about locking the
office this aint no one-horse country
station and you know it i havent any
particular desire to -answer guilty to the
charge of manslaughter but i think i can
stick it out another night and then-oh
well when morning comes ill think about
it and he slammed the lever over with an
extra vicious bang as he began setting the
switches for the local to cross into the yard

   mo  tower as billy stephens had re-
marked was anything but a one-horse coun-
try station the amount of wire work alone
would have deprived it of that title while
tke work on a thirty-three-lever interlocking
plant assisted the operator in keeping his
mind off his troubles as barclay had once
expressed it

  the tower was situated near the center
of the yards at ripley where incoming
freights crossed from the main tracks to
their place in the lower yards and out-
ward-bound trains also used the switches
as a beginning of their run to silverton one
hundred and twenty-four miles west

  the roundhouse and repair shops were
situated on the outer edge of the yard tracks
nearly opposite the tower while the tower
itself perched high on its long steel legs
seemed to be keeping a careful watch on
the numerous switch shanties and yard
offices scattered promiscuously over the
yards

  suddenly thtevrer door burst open and
flew shut again with a bang that equaled
the noise of the levers as pierson the yard-
master came puffing in

   that west-bound coal drag has to run
in for water he puffed  just had the
con on the phone from the lower yards
look out for him billy

  billy glanced at the clock hows no
 pretty near ready to pull out arent
they  

   guess so in about ten minutes the
yard-master replied

    then your coal drag will have to shove
his train in off the main no  will follow
 as closely as the law allows and say tell
him to step lively please he cant have
the crossing all day  and  are both on
time he can have about six minutes to
clear after i give him the switches and no
more

  as the  ym went out stephens
shouted to him from the window  say al
tell wilson to get a move on him will you
please or he wont be able to make the

siding at  q  ahead of no  shes
right on the dot

   all right billy hell be moving soon as
he can try the air

  the local was clear now and the switches
set for  billy jumped to the table took
her orders and turned back to the levers to
give  the block just as two short blasts
of wilsons engine called for the right of
way then followed a series of maneuvers
that would have done credit to a general on
the field of battle but which are only re-
garded as commonplace in daily railroad
routine

  no sooner had the caboose wheels of 
rattled over the switches than they straight-
ened with a snap and the signals dropped
to clear just in time to avoid slowing  the 
fast mail red they flashed again as the
busy levers set the rails for the coal drag to
back into the yards for water

  clear again just in time for  the fast
passenger following  and clear the other
way as  left the block beyond open for
 red again to protect  until she got
out of the block and then clear for the coal
drag to pass on its way incidentally billy
stephens received three messages for the
 ym besides blocking the trains

  no  didnt get away quite quick
enough hes holding  on the block this
side of q billy remarked to jim bar-
clay who was still leaning against the rail
at the counter

   i suppose ill hear from that but i
didnt see any better way to do it just then
they ought to be able to stand two minutes
without busting a blood-vessel and he
turned to the table to send a bunch of mes-
sages the call boy had just left

  barclay picked up his bucket and lamp
and prepared to go home well son i
wish you good luck but i cant see why you
dont beat it before you put your foot in it
billy stopped calling a minute and swung
around in his chair looking thoughtfully at
jim for a few minutes before he said 

  i wish i could but i cant see it that
way the rules say  operators and sig-
nalmen shall remain on duty until relieved
unless otherwise ordered it hasnt been
ordered otherwise and thats a cinch of
course im tired but that cant be helped
the old man probably knows it as well as
you do the only thing i can see is to take
a fresh grip and stick to it- until re-
lieved he added as he turned slowly back
to his work
the sixty-hour trick



  barclay looked at him a minute slowly
shook his head and passed out through the
door and down the stairs

    hes got grit he murmured  but its
a tough proposition lies up against and hes
about all in when a mans face gets the
color of his and his eyes look like that i
call it a mighty doubtful bet as to his keep-
ing awake all night to-night he thought to
himself as he walked home

  in the tower the day wore slowly on-
switches orders messages car reports-car
reports messages orders switches and the
ever-present telephones at times billy
wearily closed his eyes and drew a long
breath as he leaned back in his chair for
an instants respite then as he felt the
tempting slumber stealing on him he would
start up with a jerk and bend to his work
with ever-tightening nerves he must do
it he would do it

  jim allen would certainly relieve him
in the morning and surely he could hold out
till then but oh if he could only lay down
and sleep an hour before the long night
came on-the third of his days work
no there would be no sleep for him until
relieved he wouldnt dare once asleep
it would be all off he must keep his eyes
open or give up

  but pshaw it was only a matter of
fourteen or fifteen hours longer and he
could surely keep awake that long sup-
pose however allen didnt show up in the
morning never mind there would be time
enough to figure on that later just now
it was his business to keep awake

   i want you to understand billy ste-
phens he told himself fiercely  that you
are on the job and youve got to keep
awake understand just got to youre
not going to lay down on the job-not till
youre relieved and again he plunged into
the work before him

  at five-thirty that afternoon he got the
call boy on the wire and arranged for him
to bring his supper  and johnny tell mrs
wiley to give me about two quarts of the
strongest coffee she knows how to make and
not to put any milk in it tell her to be sure
and make it strong he shouted the word
through the phone with so much energy
that he nearly knocked johnny off the chair
at the other end

  the supper came in good time and after
eating and drinking a liberal amount of
the coffee he felt very much better sev-
eral times that afternoon he had taken time

    	rr

to dash cold water over his head and face
and now he repeated the operation then
he brought out his pipe filled and lit it and
leaned back in his chair

  why surely he could stand another
night he wasnt any mollycoddle and
he was on the job to stay-until relieved
the wires and trains were nearly quiet it
was supper hour and billys thoughts
drifted to his home in he east his sister
nell would be getting supper and perhaps
planning a letter to him he wondered how
his mother was feeling

  he must write her in a day or two she
was not very well when nell wrote last
and she was getting along in years he
must stick to his work and send her a nice
present next month then things began to
run together and billy started up with a
guilty half-thankful feeling

   i almost did it then ive got to watch
out just about three seconds more and
your uncle would have been in the hay
the door burst open behind him and
the next minute the conductor of no 
was asking for orders out billy stood up
stretched bent over the key and was at it
again the time passed quickly until
about ten oclock as the familiar routine
kept him busy every few minutes he
drank sparingly of the black coffee and
again and again bathed his face with cold
water he was standing it pretty well he
thought and looked forward thankfully to
the morning and his relief

  then jim barclay came in to get orders
out for his train

  well how are you standing it billy
fine and dandy jimmy have a good
sleep   somehow sleep was before his
mind all the time

  yes first rate feel like an air-ship
 always thought youd fly away some
day jimmy

  well i didnt mean it just that way
though i do feel like it sometimes when im
breaking in one of those green brakemen
say did i tell you about he one i had lhe
other -day  

  no uess not who vas it

   denman was my engineer that trip and
when we got to  rx  we had to get in
the clear for no  you know thats a
spur siding there we had to pull by and
back into clear the station is in the way
there so denman couldnt see my signals
so he told this new boy to get out on top
and tell him what we said


the railroad mans magazine

   well he waited and waited and waited
till he thought we must be tearing the switch
to pieces and putting it together again
then he began to listen pretty anxious like
for s whistle

   every few minutes hed holler up
 what are they saying aint they said
anything yet   till by and by the feller
answers  they must be having some sort
of trouble up there i guess they havent
said a word to me yet but they seem to be
fighting like the very dickens with their
lanterns  now aint it a wonder i aint
killed some of these nights with men like
that on the head end  

  billy laughed at his old friends story
and the dry abused sort of air he main-
tained in telling it

  tell you what billy he said as he
picked up his lantern to go lets you and
i quit resign to-morrow gee wouldnt
we leave this road in an awful hole if two
such good men as you and i quit all to
once or-simultaneously as it were
my conscience wouldnt let me do it
jimmy old boy said billy with a laugh
not to mention mrs barclay

  youre right there my boy and jim
closed the door behind him

  levers and messages messages and car
reports car reports and the telephones-the
same old song and the night wore slowly
on at one in the morning billy was fight-
ing the fight of his life the sweat fairly
stood on his forehead at times in his effort
to keep his eyes open and his wandering
faculties at command up and down the
floor he staggered every few minutes down
in his chair working a while then to the
bucket for another dash of water tired
he never had any conception before of what
the word meant he was almost ready to
barter his soul for sleep

  at three he sat down to clear up a pile
of car report which would take about forty
minutes of sending after that was over
the greater part of his nights work would
be finished he settled down in his chair
his eyes staring blankly before him and
began to call  ab-ab-ab-ab-ab
-mo-ab-ab-ab-mo

   i-i ab came the answer

  hr he began and the drowsy steady
rattle of the instrument went on and on as
he turned sheet after sheet

  the window in front of his table looked
down the tracks west from the tower and
glancing up occasionally he could see the

faint glimmer of his home target through
the hole on the reverse side of the lamp it
was set to red for the yard engine was using
the main track to switch on for a few min-
utes after sending about half of the pile
he looked out to see a half-dozen cars that
the yard engine had kicked out standing
on the main track

  what was that the instrument at his

right was saying----os-os

no  by  a m a g

  no  coming and those cars standing
on the main he would have to get that
yard crew after them right away and give
a clear track he started to get up and
get his lamp what he couldnt move
he tried again but he couldnt stir a finger
it must be paralysis

  he had read of people stricken that way

  the overwork and loss of sleep had been
too severe a trial barclay was right he
had gone too far and put his foot in it
he tried again straining every nerve the
sweat started from every pore he must
get up he must clear that track but
no it was only too true not a move could
he make

  he ceased his efforts and tried to think
he had given  rm  the next block
clear after  had passed rm
would let  through without doubt he
tried to reach the other key but he could
not even move his fingers he tried to
shout perhaps he could attract some ones
attention though the chances were small
with all the noise of the instruments inside
and the switch engines outside but still
he would try

  he tried as though his life depended
upon it but not a sound could he make
not even a whisper what an awful con-
dition he was in was there no way out
his mind worked with the rapidity of light-
ning he couldnt signal he couldnt call
he couldnt stop them by the wire

  but pshaw why hadnt he thought of
it his signals were set red and no 
would merely come to a stop and whistle
for the signals a waiting passenger train
whistling for signals would soon bring
help and then everything would be all
right at least all right as far as the
road was concerned he thought whim-
sically that they would have to find a relief
for him then his railroad days were
over

  hark what was that number  ls
whistle they were making good time
the sixty-hour trick



evidently yes there was her headlight
coming around the distant curve well
itwould soon be over and there would be
one less operator

  why doesnt she slow up his hair
seemed to raise on his scalp no  was
coming down the track at top speed and
only a trains length from his signal on
it came was it a crazy man at the throttle
or had he been stricken as billy had
couldnt the man see

  oh for the power to move to do
something

  a hundred yards fifty now

  bang

  billy found himself standing on his feet
and trembling in every limb the slam of
the door behind the night yardmaster had
awakened him

  hows no  son

  about on time i believe sir he fal-
tered out and glanced at the clock

  it was three-twenty-five he had been
asleep six minutes no  was still
twenty-three miles away thank god

  please get those fellows off the main
for them will you he said to pierson

  off the main why theyve been clear
of the main for twenty minutes were you
asleep son  

  perhaps i was sir im all right now
though

  he staggered to the levers and straight-
ened the track for no  when the sig-
nals were clear again and all was o k
he sank wearily down in his chair to dis-
cover that his key was wide open

  he had fallen sound asleep while sending
to ab

  bk excuse me a minute sorry kept
you w-aiting he faltered and closed the
key

  six oclock found billy watching the
street-cars from the tower window allen
would surely show up this morning

  was that he no yes it was billy
stephens felt a rush of thankfulness such as
he had never felt before his long days
work was over sixty hours sixty hours
of nerve-racking work and some of it the
worst agony he had ever experienced in his
life

  hallo jim old boy im mighty glad
to see you just take right hold as if you
worked here im going home to bed now
and wo to the one who dares to call me till
i wake up again said billy as he made a
dive for his coat and hat

  and say jim he added just work
till youre relieved

engineer petit of the wheeling swings out on the pilot and snatches a

child from track

there are many persons who are inclined to
regard the rescuing of a child from death
beneath the wheels of an on-rushing locomotive as
a wild dream of melodrama writers but had any
of them witnessed the heroic act of charles petit
an engineer on the w and l e who risked his
life recently at coshocton ohio to save a tiny
girl who-sat between the rails their views on the
subject would have undergone a decided change

  the only witness to the thrilling affair was the
childs mother mrs george markley who glan-
cing out of a window saw the child on the tracks
and the events which followed in quick succession

  mrs markley had left little mary for a moment
in a room in the house while she went up-stairs
to dress

  the child stole from the house and walked out
to the railroad where she sat down in the mid-
dle of the track she sat there perhaps five min-
utes when the afternoon train due at coshocton
at  north-bound came down the tracks

  engineer petit whose home is in cleveland
was in charge he didnt ase the child until he
had reached the crossing at seventh street
scarcely a half block away the whistle screeched
but the child paid no attention to it

  petit seeing that he could not stop his engine
in time to miss the child left his cab and ran along
the running-board at the side of the engine to the
pilot holding to the pilot with one hand and
bending his body far out over the racks he
swooped the child in his arms and with a mighty
grip pulled both the child and himself safely to
the engine pilot he then rushed back to the cab
with the child in his arms applied the brakes and
brought the train to a stop at the orange street
station

  mrs markley the mother of the child had
glanced out of the up-stairs window just before
the train hove in sight and when she saw her
childs plight she became helpless and nearly
swooned -coshocton daily age

love by the sea

he cottage was set high upon
the most elevated part of
the island and the island
-copper-clad island the
sailors called it-was off
the scottish coast where the
waves beat high and the wind blows fresh
and straight from the arctic the cottage
was a humble one it was as white as
whitewash could make it and wreathed
with trailing vines

   on a chair under a giant tree in the spa-
cious front yard sat a young man of marked
appearance he was handsome-but for
the paleness of his face and the sad expres-
sion of his eyes that he was ill at ease
was plainly evident on several occasions
he started gave a glance toward the sea
and each time that he did so he breathed
a sigh of keen disappointment

   occasionally he would glance toward the
cottage but no one seemed visible there
then he would sweep the front stretch of
ocean with his gaze

   the sun was just sinking and even while
it- last ray lingered upon land and ocean
a black cloud was gathering in the northern
sky observing this a shadow passed over
the face of this man and he said

  there is a storm brewing and if so
mr moreland may not reach us to-night a
storm brewing yes for me and my loved
ones i feel that there is and that its burst-
ing will be terrible must i ever suffer this
agony of mind why will he thus follow
me is it not enough that i have retired
from the world and no longer bear his
name i would be happy with my wife

and children but for this dread which is
ever hanging over me if i could tell her
it might relieve me but no-i have de-
ceived my wife and i must endure alone
he relapsed into silence again he had
not observed the approach of other parties
while he had been speaking there emerged
from the cottage a woman leading by the
hand two little girls dressed in white soft-
ly they came forward as if to surprise the
speaker but his last words were heard and
the woman suddenly stopped while an ex-
pression of anxiety passed over her face

  the children bounded to the mans side
and in chorus exclaimed

   see papa we are ready

  the man arose to his feet and fixing his
eyes upon the woman he appeared trying
to read her thoughts it was evident from
her manner that something had affected her

  blanche did you hear my words he
asked

  i did herman

  the answer was given slowly and the
woman appeared to dwell upon the last
word as if she would convey some especial
meaning by doing so this was observed
and the question asked

  did you hear me speak of having de-
ceived you blanche

  i did

   why do you dwell upon that last word
with such peculiar emphasis there al-
ways has been a smile uponyour face when
you so addressed me will you explain
the woman came forward and encircled
the mans neck with her arms she gazed
up into his eyes while tears glistened in
her own then in a sweet and almost
pleading voice she said

   herman for five years my happiness
has been almost complete i have tried to
through- by sunrise



make our home a pleasant one although i
may have failed in my efforts many times
i have seen a cloud on your face and i
have sought to learn the cause that i might
share your griefs herman you have some
secret which you have kept from me and-
oh heavens i heard you say that you had
deceived me look upon these children
herman our little twin cherubs blanche
and lillian to-morrow will be their third
birthday and the neighbors will gather to
greet us let us all be happy 

   what has come over you you act so
queerly   asked the man with indifference
as if trying to avoid the womans pleading

   i will explain herman several times
of late my attention has been attracted by
the sudden appearance and disappearance
of a stranger he would pass my window
gaze in but would not speak i thought
very little of the matter-not even enough
to make mention of it to you but-

   go on blanche

   but a few moments ago i was standing
by my-window when suddenly i felt my
arm grasped i was somewhat startled but
still more so when a voice whispered my
name at the same time a letter was thrust
into my hand i turned and recognized the
stranger but he instantly disappeared be-
hind die vines

  well the letter

   i opened it and the first words that my
eyes fell upon were diat i have been deceived
by you

  and you believed this

  no i crushed the paper in my hands
and threw it upon the floor in my indigna-
tion then i reflected for a moment and
came to the conclusion diat it was only
worthy of contempt as i fully believed that
some malicious person jealous of our happi-
ness had sought diis means of marring it
why eidier you or myself should have
enemies i cannot tell at first i thought
i would not annoy you even by mentioning
the matter but finally concluded to bring
you the note i have not read its entire
contents

   and yet you believe the charge

    i do not

  then-why this unusual agitation

   i will speak frankly could you have
seen my face as i approached you would
have observed that my usual smile was there
but i heard your words you spoke of
having deceived me then it occurred to
me that diere might possibly be some truth

in die assertion contained in the letter and
this thought nearly overcame me

   do you believe me in all i say and do 
 i do my husband yet i tremble as i
look at you now there is something which
tells me that a great weight presses upon
your heart each day you are becoming
paler and more silent and thoughtful

   am i less affectionate than formerly  
oh no you seem even to increase in
tenderness cant you make me your con-
fidant

   blanche my deception had been in sim-
ply withholding the secret of my life but
you shall soon know all i am expecting
our friend mr morelandfrom southamp-
ton this very night when he arrives then
i will explain in the meantime i want
to see you smile again

  there was an unmistakable fervor in the
voice of the husband as he spoke and pressed
his wife to his bosom tears glistened in
her eyes but th sweet smile she woreplainly
told the fact that her confidence for a rao-
mentshaken had been fully restored

  fondly the father caressed his little ones
darkness was coming on the sky had be-
come thick with clouds and the moaning of
the wafers mingled with the bellowing of
thunder entering the cottage they pro-
ceeded to a sleeping-room up-stairs

  seating himself herman tillman opened
the crushed note he started as his eyes
fell upon the handwriting and there were
unmistakable signs of indignation upon his
face as he perused it then he said

   blanche i will read you this

   if it pleases my husband

  yes-it runs as follows

  blanche

    it is best that you know the truth your
  husband is a robber a forger and a mur-
  derer he is living in seclusion on this is-
  land to avoid detection and arrest but his
  days are numbered in a short time you
   will be alone unless you will consent to ac- 
  cept the protection of one who loves you for t
  yourself i shall be present to-morrow at
  the celebration and you may expect to wit-
  ness important and interesting scenes

                                avenger

  neither husband nor wife uttered a word
for some moments after this reading then
the mother arose andpreparing her little
ones placed them to rest during this time
tillman watched her with deep interest
she smiled but it seemed to require an ef-
fort she was deeply agitated and trem-


the railroad mans magazine

bled visibly in spite of her efforts to prevent
doing so

  at length she approached her husband
and tenderly embracing him said

   herman let us kneel and ask gods
protection	 

  there was a loving confidence in the tones
of that noble wife and the scene was an
impressive one as both bowed before their
maker the words uttered by blanche were
touching and when the prayer was ended
there came from die husbands lips a re-
sponsive amen

  the wind had been increasing without
and die rain was falling in torrents the
crashing thunder pounded the heavens and
the lightning-flashes were almost incessant

  the dark form of a man emerged from
among the vines and paused under the
window where the light was burning then
he began to clamber up the trellis in a
moment he reached such a position that he
could command a view of the interior of
the apartment

  for some time he watched the proceed-
ings of those within he could hear their
words and they seemed to madden him
slowly he drew a pistol from his pocket
raised it and took careful aim it was
at the moment when the husband and wife
knelt

  the arm which held the weapon of death
was halted as if the murderous act had
been prevented by some unseen power

  in a moment after the villain reached
the ground and as he slunk away in the
darkness he muttered

   my plans are well laid but i must be
cautious maddened by that sight i came
near committing a rash act to-night but
to-morrow shall see my work advancing
i shall have gold no longer will i be
a poor man but a gentleman of position

  my tools are ready for my work poor
simpletons how easily they are deceived
i will go among them now and see that
diey are ready for early action then to-
morrow for england and a liappy life

chapter ii

the accuser

the following fnorning was fdled with
sunshine millions of dewy gems
were glittering upon the vines and the flow-
er- the birds were warbling their glad
songs the waters of the channel shone like

burnished steel in the sun and many a
white-winged vessel could be seen gliding
over its bosom

  the tillman family were early astir and
the little ones were clad in their robes of
white they knew it was to be a gala day
for them

  herman tillman was paler than usual
but his wife appeared to be especially gay
that it caused her something of an effort
was evident but she had confidence in her
husband that some villain was making
an effort to crush them she felt sure but
she believed that he would fail

  for some time herman had been standing
by the window presently he turned to his
wife and asked

   blanche is it not understood that those
who are to visit us to-day shall come dressed
in holiday attire  

   such was the understanding i be-
lieve

  but what does this mean yonder
comes a body of men accompanied by a few
women there are no children with them
they appear to be excited

   look some of them are armed
what can it mean  

  blanche tillman clutched the back of
a chair something unusual was taking
place she thought of the letter and the
threats made against her husband

  nearer and nearer came the men and
at length paused before the cottage till-
man was called upon to appear advanc-
ing in a cheerful manner he extended his
hands to several with whom he was in-
timately acquainted

  they turned away murmurings burst
forth from almost every lip at the same
time a threatening movement was made as
if to seize him

  it was not strange that tillman should
exhibit a little agitation or that his cheeks
became a shade paler than usual to the
men his agitation was a confirmation of
that which they had already heard

  blanche stood by the side of her husband
trembling and the children clung to their
mother in fright

  at length tillman asked

  friends what is the meaning of this
your greetings artf far different from what
i expected

  let me answer you exclaimed peter
raymond a severe-looking man stepping
forward

  what does this mean raymond
through by sunrise



  you see friends he knows me said
raymond

  yes-yes was the general response
and another threatening movement was
made tillman met this with a proud
expression and addressing raymond he
asked

   what have you to do with me  what
is the meaning of all this

   it means that i have found you out
you murderer

  murderer

  yes robber forger and murderer

   you-you-

  take care yelled raymond inter-
rupting  i can prove what i say

   then do it-now said tillman
turning to those around him raymond
said

  friends i come among you as an aven-
ger some years ago there dwelt in london
a poor family by the name of gorman
they had an only daughter called blanche
by chance this young and innocent girl
formed the acquaintance of one she sup-
posed to be an honorable man but he
was not he was a villain of the deepest
dye still he managed to win the love of
blanche and made her his wife i am
speaking of the woman before you now
let me ask her one question blanche was
not your father murdered in the streets of
london  

  yes oh yes was the trembling an-
swer

    still another question did your mother
die a short time after of a broken heart
 yes

   i will tell you the author of all this
your father became acquainted with the
true character of george clifford the person
who now calls himself your husband and
who is known here as herman tillman
your father was an honest man and meet-
ing that villain in the street upbraided him
clifford killed him

  blanche groaned in despair

  hear me further continued raymond
your mother died soon after as i have
said you were alone in the world tak-
ing advantage of this tillman urged you
to an immediate marriage you consented
and became as you supposed the wife of
an honest man

  for a time you remained in london
with your murderer husband living in the
utmost seclusion the reason for this was
that a price was set upon the head of george

clifford so closely was he hunted that
after a time he came here for safety and
here i have traced him is not the fact
that he has been living under an assumed
name and seldom seen abroad a convincing
proof that something is wrong

   it is was the general response

   do you not confess blanche that you
were married to this man under the name
of george clifford

   yes-yes replied the poor woman
faintly

  have you finished your story asked
the accused

  no i have much more to say

    then say it

    friends have you not since the resi-
dence of this man among you found at least
three bodies upon the coast with the appear-
ance of having been murdered  

  yes wasthe response

   this thief robber forger and mur-
derer came among you without the means
of subsistence he has not toiled honestly
as you have done where has he procured
his money i will answer the question for
you when some passenger with treasure
about him escaping from a wreck had
managed to reach your island this villain
murdered and robbed him i myself was
on the brig harvest when she foundered in
the channel i know that one small boat
containing six passengers and quite a quan-
tity of gold set out for this point the
boat was afterward found but the men
were never heard from it was about this
time that you discovered the bodies referred
to-was it not  

  it was

    i charge this villain with having robbed
and muwlercd them

  you cheap liar cried tillman as
he sprang upon his accuser he was seized
and prevented from doing raymond an in-
jury in a few moments however he be-
came more calm and said

   go on raymond have you anything
more to say 

  last night during the storm an old
man landed upon this island he had
come from southampton as a passenger
his name was moreland and we learned
from the captain of the vessel that he had
a considerable amount of money with him
i know mr moreland and he will give
the lie to your story

   you see friends the evidence is coming
in if anything additional was required


the railroad mans magazine

he confesses to have known the murdered
man 

  murdered repeated tillman in sur-
prise

    oh we are aware of all well i was
passing along when i heard cries for help
i hastened to the spot from whence the
sounds proceeded i was just in time to
see a form disappear in the darkness but
i found an old man struggling in the agon-
ies of death

    was it mr moreland  

    notice his pretended surprise friends
well i bent over the dying man he
grasped my hand and said faintly

   i have been robbed heaven have
mercy on me-i saw the face of my assassin
-his name is clifford-george clifford
my god cried the accused man as
he reeled backward poor blanche fainted
and the children began the most piteous
moanings all this produced the effect of
sdll more fully convincing those around
of the guilt of the man before them

  the excitement was now running high
and for a time it seemed evident that till-
man would be summarily dealt with there
could be no doubt of his guilt on a vessel
not far distant lay the body of his victim
and his dying words had denounced his
murderer but tillman rallied and ex-
claimed 

    men i do not ask you to be generous
but i expect you to be just this man from
some cause to me unknown has become
my bitter foe much and nearly all that
he has said i can disprove give me time
and i will unravel this whole mystery i
believe that my accuser is the murderer of
mr moreland will you listen to my
storv  

chapter iii

the husband talks

hpillman turned to his fainting wife
and raised her from the ground
where she had fallen he held her in his
arms

  raymond seemed to be very impatient
he began whispering among those whom he
had hoped to lead into rash acts a few
words from tillman had a thrilling effect

  friends he said in a low but well-
modulated voice  for so i will yet call you
i want my dear wife to hear my story i
will soon explain conviction must be car-

ried te-your hearts be patient for a mo-
ment it is my wish i repeat that blanche
should hear every word i have to say

    i will listen came the faint response
of blanche

    and believe  

    yes i will believe you cannot utter
a falsehood-you are too noble

    bless you-bless you my wife he
said then addressing those standing near
he continued

   now i will give you the secret of my
life i-

   at that moment an old sailor came up
from the shore he glanced around and
in an instant his eyes fell upon tillman
he doffed his hat and advanced in a re-
spectful manner tillman extended his
hand and the name of pierre montrosa
escaped his lips the greeting was a
cordial one and the sailor whispered a
few words in tillmans ear after doing
so he spoke in undertones to blanche then
turned to fondle the children

   the face of tillman flushed and his
eyes glowed with a triumphant expression
as he listened to the words of pierre mon-
trosa when they were repeated to blanche
she appeared to be overcome for an instant
and threw herself on her husbands bosom
crying with joy

   this seemed to be the general impression
there was evidently a great reaction in
favor of the accused raymond saw this
and he grew uneasy

   a smile rested upon the face of tillman
as he began

  my father and his family were for-
merly residents of madras british india
for an especial service my father was
knighted by the east indian company
he had however accumulated great wealth
and sailed for london where he settled i
sometimes felt that a false pride had taken
possession of my parents heart but i must
not reproach him his position was not
that of a british knight and this made him
perhaps more sensitive than he otherwise
would have been i was his only son-his
only child he had forgotten his own early
love and wished his son united to a lady
of honor as termed by the royal courts
the woman designated was penniless al-
though titled they called her lady but
in a brief acquaintance with her i learned
more fully to understand the exact signifi-
cance of that term in brittany she had a
superior title but  riches a paltry pen-
through by sunrise



sion was her only means of support my
father had ample wealth and so he was
willing and even anxious to sacrifice his
boy of twenty and his estates for a woman
of thirty with a title which could not sus-
tain itself without gold which she had not
is it a wonder that i rebelled  

   no-no was the general response

    he lies  yelled raymond

    will you hear me through   asked
 clifford

  yes-yes-go on

   wishing to avoid this hated union and
 --loathing the society of her my father had
 pressed on me i sought seclusion during
 my retirement i formed the acquaintance
 of blanche gorman she was a poor girl
 as my accnser has stated but i loved her
 from the first and it was my wish to make
 her my wife i knew that my father would
 oppose the union

   one morning the terrible intelligence
 was conveyed to us that mr gorman had
 been murdered the blow fell heavily upon
 the daughter but moreheavily upon the
 mother and she died not long after let
 me ask you in such a case what would
 any one of you have done

    married the girl was the general re-
 sponse

    i did do so

    a false marriage growled raymond
   clifford continued

  the reverend joseph moreland was
 my friend and to him i confided all he
 advised me to make tire orphan my wife
 at once and i did so

   and last night you murdered him
 growled raymond

   a murmur of disapprobation followed
 these words but tillman did not heed
 them and continued

    my friend mr moreland performed
 the ceremony and blanche gorman became
 my wife i knew that i must make sacri-
 fices of wealth and position when this step
 was taken but i heeded them not to live
 in quiet with her was my highest ambition
 for here and only here could i find hap-
 piness

   an exclamation of approval burst from
 the lips of the listeners while raymond
 writhed clifford went on

    i know that i acted in a childish man-
 ner i feared my fathers curses and so
 i kept the matter a secret living most of
 the time in seclusion at length i was
 discovered i had kept the secret of my

 noble family from my wife fearing that the
 disclosure would compromise her happi-
 ness i had no other motive

   heaven bless you my husband mur-
mured the wife as she clung closely to him

  well tillman continued i made
mr moreland my arbiter but my father
would not listen to him mr moreland has
always been my friend at my invitation
he came to visit me and-

   and you have murdered him put in
raymond

  let me say a few words in regard to
my accuser said tillman

   do not hear him cried raymond

   go on go on   yelled the crowd

   i will said tillman  this man was
my fathers confidential secretary i did
not like him for he has a repulsive face
but  made an effort to overcome my preju-
dice why he has become so bitter an
enemy to me and my family i cannot tell
surely my father would never justify him
in this persecution

  raymond pushed forward and said

   those here may believe your story but
until you can disprove your deeds of last
night you must still stand convicted as the
assassin of the reverend joseph more-
land

   come with me to the vessel friends
continued tillman there we will view
the dead body

  raymond offered no resistance

  in a short time the party reached the
vessels deck the accuser of tillman
started back in horror seated in an easy
chair in the suns warm rays was an
aged and wounded man-still alive and
recovering

  raymond attempted to escape from the
vessel but he was detained then tillman
asked of his old friend

 mr moreland could you recognize the
face of the man who attempted to murder
you last night

   i could my old friend was the replv
  did i do it

  no-oh no

  tillman turned to the crowd and said
 let no man leave this craft until every
one has passed before this wounded man 
none appeared to shrink-not even ray-
mond one after another passed in front
of mr moreland and at length raymond
came by his lips quivered slightly and
he averted his eyes but the old man grasped
him by the arm and cried


the railroad mans magazine

   this is the man i 

  raymond was placed in irons and im-
portant papers found upon him which had
been taken from the supposed murdered
man pierre montrosa had brought the
word to tillman diat moreland still lived

chapter iv

why he was exiled

ts that villain raymond in irons
    asked mr moreland

   he is returned tillman kneeling by
his side blanche and her little ones were
near

   if i could be merciful continued the
old man  i should say let him go and he
would never be happy but-

   the law must grasp him

  yes let the wretch be punished as
he deserves

  this shall be done but have you
strength now to tell me of my own affairs
and why raymond has become such a bitter
foe to me and my family  

  mr moreland began while many aside
from those especially interested crowded
around to hear his words three years
before tillman and his wife had been pas-
sengers on that same vessel several of the
sailors had afterward vsited him at his
cottage home and among the number was
pierre montrosa

  herman tillman was really george clif-
ford he had changed his name fearing
his fathers wrath when he married now
that the inhabitants of copper-clad island
knew the truth he would keep it a secret
no longer

  george clifford-as we shall know him
from this on-had been accused of murder
after his pretended discovery of the old
man in the last agonies of death as ray-
mond supposed he hastened to the vessel
and told his story implicating an innocent
man believing his victim dead he pro-
ceeded to mingle with the inhabitants of
the island and circulate the same story
urging them to take immediate vengeance
on the assassin

  his object in murdering the old man was
apparent he was aware of the fact or
believed such to be the case that mr more-
land had quite a sum of money in his pos-
session which he was bringing to young
clifford he also knew that more-
land had certain documents about him

which would be of advantage to himself
besides the old minister who had solem-
nized the marriage of clifford and blanche
had made frequent visits to the young peo-
ple in their exile and would prove a friend
to clifford and perhaps foil his plan

  all these circumstances rendered his re-
moval desirable to raymond

  why did raymond seek the death of
george clifford

  this conversation took place upon the
vessels deck

  an anxious expression rested upon clif-
fords face as he knelt by the side of his
friend mr moreland began

   your father loves you my boy-
  thank god exclaimed clifford
  dont raise your hopes too high

    my father will forgive me 

  no-he is inexorable

    then what have i to hope for  

   for a long time i have believed that
your father would relent one week ago
i visited him he did not appear in the
best of humor and he would not listen to
me i spoke of your daughters but he did
not soften i pleaded hard and finally
touched his heart turning to me he said
  never will i acknowledge my son and
his plebeian wife when she is dead tell
him to come to me 

  blanche groaned as she bowed her head
on her husbands bosom

  do you consider that my fathers heart
was really touched   asked clifford

  you did not hear me through boy

    go on-i will listen patiently

    i told your father that you would never
part with your wife while she lived and
i did not for a moment believe that you
would ever return to the paternal roof un-
less the memory of that wife was respected
and honored after she was dead

  you spoke truly

  can you imagine what your fathers
answer was

     let him starve i suppose

  you wrong him boy

   i do not wish to do so but what was
his reply

   it was his reply and his action which
nearly cost both you and myself our lives
 pray explain

   he said that if you would not leave
your wife he would only settle upon you
the sum of five hundred pounds a year
he wants you to go to america and never
bring further disgrace upon his name
through by sunrise



   very kind

   then he spoke tenderly of your chil-
 dren

     what of them  

     he considers the sum he settled upon
 you augmented by your own exertions as
 amply sufficient for the support of your
 family should your wife die you can
 return to london with the children should
 you die leaving them only their mother
  he does not consider the five hundred as
 sufficient for their support and education
 and the amount will be increased to one
 thousand pounds

    that is indeed kind of him

     raymond was present while your father
 was speaking and saw me receive two thou-
 sand pounds to be conveyed to you then
 your father named that villain as the guard-
 ian of your children and the controller of
 their yearly income in the event of your
 death

     it is plain now why he sought my life
 but you do not understand his motive
 in trying to murder me 

     certainly in the first place he cov-
 eted the money you had in your possession
 in the next place he knew that your friend-
 ship for my family would cause you to look
 into matters and that he would be detected
  that is plain but now tell me my
 boy what plans have you 

    you tell me that my father has sent me
 two thousand pounds

   yes

     did not raymond take it from you last
 night 

    he did but it has been recovered
 my father suggested that i should go
 to america  

  he did

 i will go at first thought it seems
hard to leave here but i shall find friends
in that country my small capital will en-
able me to commence a modest business
when will you sail

    at once to-morrow i will leave for
 southampton the first vessel sailing
 from thence shall carry me and my family
 to new york

chapter v

the disappearance

 a week later george clifford his
 wife and two little daughters stood
 upon die deck of the tempest watching

the shores of england as they were re-
ceding from view the last farewell word
had been spoken the embarkation had
taken place quietly at southampton but
two friends were there to say good-by-old
mr moreland and iierre montrosa

  ill see you in america before long
said pierre as the ship cast off her moor-
ings when they were fairly started the
wife said

   george why did you start and tremble
as that aged gentleman upon the wharf
came into view waved his handkerchief
and then so suddenly disappeared

   it was my father

   and he would not come and grasp your
hand or speak one encouraging word

   so it seems but he shall be proud of
me yet

  there are few in this world who have
not cause for sorrow and ours may really
be less than many who seem more happy
if i should speak just as i think i would
say that i am at this moment far happier
than my father with all his wealth and
his title i cannot say that i have much
to reproach myself with and i know that
he will not feel the same when he serious-
ly considers his attitude toward me

   do not be too harsh dear george
your father has not cast you from his heart
for he has made ample provision for our
support

   blanche you are my wife and you
must know that you are all the world to me
were you a countess and the possessor of
great wealth and i but a poor titleless man
would you have loved me the same as
now  

   you know george it is only one week
since i first learned that you were anything
but a poor titleless man

  true but had it been as i suggest
would you have loved me

  as dearly as now

    i believe it

  the next morning broke clear and beau-
tiful thus several days passed they
were nearing the shore of new york and
every one was high in anticipation of a
safe arrival

  but as night was coming on the sky be-
came overcast with clouds no one ex-
pected much trouble a terrible storm
broke over the ship in a short time the
heavens were ablaze and the bellowing of
the elements was terrific

  yet no one appeared to be alarmed


the railroad mans magazine

suddenly there was a terrible crash and the
mainmast came down upon the deck im-
mediately there was great confusion soon
the cry was raised that the straining of the
ship had opened a seam in her bottom and
that she was leaking badly

  all hands were called to the pumps but
the utmost efforts were unavailing and the
vessel was fast settling

  then a new terror presented itself
flames began to issue through the hatch-
way the lightning had ignited a portion
of the cargo destruction was inevitable

rockets were thrown into the air but no
answering signals came

  man the life-boats shouted the cap-
tain

 where is my husband asked
blanche as she came on deck he was
not to be found he had been seen stand-
ing by the bulwarks but a moment before
the doomed vessel was struck his name
was called in vain the wild wailing of
the distracted wife received no response
from him for a moment her strength ap-
peared to fail

                   to be continued

electrigity in gar ventilation

    from a paper by b iv stowe read before the railway electrical engineers

ventilation one of the two effects sought
in the employment of electrical equipment
on railway cars implies the removal of foul and
stagnant air -from passenger-coaches such air
for our purpose shall include not only such ele-
ments as may be detected by the sense of smell
but of microscopic organisms including disease
germs

  dust and suspended matter may be made up of
spores seeds pollen hair cellular tissue epider-
mal cells and other animal substances these
various impurities mingled with carbon dioxide
and watery vapor products of combustion are
what gives to a room that odor which is so notice-
able to one coming in from the outside and ren-
ders the atmosphere close and oppressive

  few of us realize that the air we breathe is so
laden with impurities it is perhaps best that
we remain in ignorance of the fact that even coun-
try air contains on an average  dust particles
per cubic centimeter and that in city air carries
as high as  particles records are extant
which the air in tenement-houscs reveals 
particles per cubic centimeter

  xow to most of us it matters not whether the
air wc breathe is rat-d in terms of the dust in
suspension or the carbon-dioxide content en-
dowed with the sense of smell we are made con-
scious of abnormal conditions in the air we
breathe can easily distinguish between good and
bad odors liy a feeling of oppression and lassi-
tude ofttimes accompanied by headache and
drowsiness we are to understand that th per cent
of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere has
readied a dangerous point

  the evidences of impure air in a room are re-

vealed in many ways it is not possible to detect
the presence of disease germs however and we
can only accept the assumption that if we are
conscious of impurities in the air we breathe
germs are undoubtedly present it then behooves
us to consider not the question of infection but
how best to insure a supply of pure air in propor-
tion to the rate at which it becomes vitiated

  our modem passenger-coaches otherwise
known as  general service cars seat approxi-
mately eighty people each adult and normal per-
son requires about  cubic feet of air per hour
medical authorities prescribe a clear space of
about  cubic feet per adult in order to insure
an adequate supply of air

  cars of the above classification contain about
 cubic feet of space and calculating the cubic
feet of air required by eighty persons as 
it is evident that the ideal ventilation of a
modern day coach would be accomplished only by
some means whereby the entire air content would-
be changed fifty times per hour or nearly once
every minute

  furthermore if we care to continue our search
forthe ideal and in the light of medical require-
ments we will find in order to vouchsafe to each
occupant of such cars his allotment of  cubic
feet of space that the capacity of each gar would
be limited to eight passengers but such con-
siderations have no place in modern railroad prac-
tice indeed the traveling public demands no
very strict observance of the laws of health if
such laws are to be interpreted as above the
foregoing analysis is of value only in showing
how far short of natures requirements does mod-
ern practice obtain
despatching trains by tele
phone

by john c thomson

in the july number of the railroad mans magazine we reprinted a short
item from an eminent contemporary the railway ami engineering review
which stated in part  one of the most important innovations which has
taken place in the history of railroading is that being put into effect now by
many of the railroads throughout the country namely a new method of des-
patching trains the telephone is gradually replacing the telegraph for this
service on many of the big railroad systems in the united states

    this item which we published only as an interesting bit of news-and it is
our province truly to record for the benefit of our readers all important mat-
ters relating to railroad service-brought forth a storm of abuse from tele-
graph operators in all parts of the country these writers claimed that the
item was false that the telephone was installed to take the place of the telegraph
for sinister motives only and we were blamed for publishing trash

    fearing that we might ke in the wrong we commissioned an absolutely
unbiased writer to fully investigate the matter the facts of his investigation
are set forth in this article the authorities which mr thomson plentifully
quotes are men whose statements cannot be doubted

    at any rate we beg to inform the great army of telegraph operators that
if they fear that the telephone will eventually obliterate them-the alone
hold this view the telephone will have its place in train despatching for many
good reasons but it will no more displace the telegraph than-as the mail clerks
declared forty years ago when the telegraph came into being-the unite states
mail would go out of existence

why the telephone has replaced the telegraph for the despatching of
trains on fifty-five american railroads exceeding  miles

the opinions of experts on this new departure

phone will eventually replace the telegraph
this prediction however is disputed by
many telegraph operators but the rail-
roads declare that the telephone is coming
into service with more speed than was first
imagined

  the western electric company which
has installed over ninety - three per cent
of all the railroad telephones - especially
those used for despatching-gives the three

the past three
the telephone has
ed the telegraph
train - despatching
ither purposes on
over fifty-five american
railroads whose combined mileage exceeds

	miles the movement seems to be
growing rapidly so much so in fact that
many railroad men predict that the tele-


the railroad mans magazine

following reasons for the rapid introduction
of die telephone

    first and most important was the enact-
  ment of state and federal laws limiting the
  working day of railroad employees transmit-
  ting or receiving orders pertaining to the
  movement of trains to nine hours

    the second reason which is directly de-
  pendent upon the first was the inability of
  the railroads to obtain the additional num-
  ber of telegraph operators which were re-
  quired under the provisions of the new laws

  it was estimated that fifteen thousand addi-
  tional operators would be required to main-
  tain service in the same fashion in  after
  the new laws went into effect the increased
  expense occasioned by the employment of
  these additional operators was estimated at
  approximately ten million dollars per year

    a third reason for the introduction of the
  telephone is the decreased efficiency of the
  average railway and commercial telegraph
  operator there is a very general complaint
  among the railroads to-day regarding this par-
  ticular point and many of them welcome the
  telephone for the sole reason that it renders
  them independent of the telegrapher what
  has occasioned this it is not easy to say but
  there is a strong tendency to lay this de-
  creased efficiency to the attitude of the tele-
  graphers organization toward the student
  operator it is a fact too that the limits
  which these organizations have placed on stu-
  dent operators was directly responsible for
  the lack of available men when they were
  needed

  the above reasons may or may not be so
and are much in dispute especially as the
telegraph operators practically deny all
three of them

  a fourth reason advanced by the rail-
roads in general and vigorously denied by
the telegraphers is that the use of the tele-
phone in despatching means greater safety
for instance in may  at atlanta
georgia before a meeting of telegraphers
president perham of the order of railroad
telegraphers read a paper attacking the
use of the telephone for railroad work and
train-despatching in particular in answer
to this c h gaunt assistant general man-
ager and superintendent of telegraph for the
santa fe says in a letter

the santa fes claims

    telephone despatching has been in no way 
  responsible for any accident in any territory
  so equipped i may add further that in no
  instance have we gone back to the telegraph
  despatching after once starting the telephone

  circuit except of course temporarily for
  very short periods of time during wire trou-
  bles on the telephone pair

  in an article in the railroad age-gazette
telephone train - despatching on the
santa fe it is claimed that -

    the telephonic transmission of the line of
  the greatest length fresno to san francisco
  and branches  miles with  stations
  bridged across the line leaves practically
  nothing to be desired either in volume of
  sound or clearness of articulation the line
  failures by superior construction have been
  reduced to a minimum and the curious fact
  has developed that during heavy fogs in the
  san francisco bay vicinity it is possible suc-
  cessfully to operate the telephone circuits
  after line-escapes due to moisture have ren-
  dered the telegraph wires partially inopera-
  tive  

 the santa fe now has over  miles
of road under telephone instead of tele-
graph and are constantly adding to the new
service

  some railroads in fact even advertise
in the daily papers that the use of the tele-
phone for train - handling is a factor of
safety and bid for passengers on this basis
the lehigh valley for instance has it

    safety speed and comfort the telephone
  superseding the telegraph a perfect sys-
  tem made even more perfect irrespective of
  expense by the gradual introduction of the
  telephone in place of the telegraph for train-
  despatching

a time saver

 the following letter sums up as com-
pactly as is verbally practical the views of
chief despatcher h mcphee of the santa
fe it is dated april  

    i attach herewith letters from night chief
  despatcher messick and dcspatchers baker
  lindsey moore and extra despatcher pat-
  terson who have handled trains by telephone
  you will notice that they all agree that the
  method of handling trains by telephone is vast-
  ly superior to the old method of handling
  them by telegraph

    	the telephone has done away entirely
  with the loss and waste of train-dcspatchers
  time calling operators which time can now be
  put to good advantage in keeping up the
  train-sheet calculating ahead and tends to
  better handling of train movement from the
  fact that the train-despatcher has more time
  at his disposal in which to arrange for the
  meeting and passing points this feature
  also secures to the despatcher the placing of
despatching trains by telephone



the orders to the trains at the time he origi-
nally outlines and figured on by him under
the old method or plan if for any reason it
would be necessary for a despatcher to spend
ten fifteen or more minutes endeavoring to
raise some certain office the despatcher of a
necessity would be crowded for valuable time
which would always result in bringing him
face to face with a congestion of train orders
to handle in other words the despatcher
would want to issue two or three orders at the
same time on account of his work being de-
layed by failure to raise an operator so far
the experience with the telephone has shown
that this feature has been eliminated

   	i believe that there is no argument be-
tween the two methods as to safety the
telephone is perfectly clear and reliable and
with the instructions pertaining to the han-
dling of train orders and checking there
should be no loophole for an error and in
case one might be made there is no reason
why it should not be mor easily detected
than with the telegraph

  no claim is being made that the actual
transmission and repeating of train orders is
being handled quicker on the telephone than
by telegraph but the officers to which the
orders are to be sent or handled are assem-
bled without loss of time which is a decided
advantage over the telegraph

for trick despatches

   there is one feature of the handling of train
orders under the telephone that should recom-
mend itself to every trick despatcher as well as
the railroad company and that is that the
train-despatcher now places in his record-
book a copy of the order as he transmits it
instead of waiting for the first station to re-
peat it and take chances of his memory veri-
fying the order as being the same as was sent
by him

  	under the old method when a train-
despatcher would have a great number of
orders to issue and repeat  os  reports or
time of trains at stations would be neglected
and a great deal of delay would ensue rais-
ing offices and requesting this information
with the telephone you can get this informa-
tion as quickly as the selector will ring up

   	under the telegraph system it was for-
merly quite a task to secure within a reason-
able length of time any satisfactory informa-
tion in case of derailment or other trouble
with the telephone the entire situation is cov-
ered in a few moments lime by getting the
conductor or party who would be in touch
with the situation to advise just what this
might be any point that would not be cov-
ered could be requested while under the old
method message after message used to he sent
before results could be obtained

    the advantages of train-despatching by
  telephone are too numerous to enumerate and
  despatchers feel that we would be going
  back to the light of other days if we had
  to go back to transmitting our orders by tele-
  graph the despatchers are getting hearty
  cooperation from all operators and agents
  and we are having success with the system
  there has been of course some wire troubles
  and minor defects all of which have been
  eliminated and at the present time i would
  say that the telephone is working as per-
  fectly in its way as did the old telegraph in-
  struments and have no doubt that if the im-
  provement will be as marked in the future-as
  it has been in the past two months the sys-
  tem will be entirely perfect in a very short
  time	h jyicphee

                          chief despatcher

 h c roehrig another santa fe des-
patcher in a signed letter to his chief des-
patchers says that the most important ad-
vantage is the calling of operators who may
be outside working local trains or handling
freight in the freight-house which is almost
impossible by telegraph operators respond
quickly and act quickly in giving instruc-
tions

  there are no student operators as-some
of our weakest men telegraphically speak-
ing are strong on the phone ability to
converse directly with the conductor or en-
gineer when desired the making of a
record of messages while sending them in
conversation the phone is much faster than
the telegraph

tell of reduced strain

  w r harkness of the western electric
company in a paper read before the st
louis railway club said that it will be
contended by many that the telegraph oper-
ator does his work unconsciously and is
therefore not subject to a mental strain
but the despatchers and operators who have
been using the telephone for despatching
work in nearly every case speak of reduced
strain

  they can do the same amount of work
by telephone in one-half the time formerly
required the abandonment of the tele-
graph-key for calling the stations has been
a great physical relief to the despatchers
and the operators have been relieved of all
calling of the despatcher

   the stations answer the signal given by
the selector-bell much more promptly than
thev do the sounder the fact that the


the railroad mans magazine

noise of the telegraph instruments is re-
moved will also have an effect upon the
work of the despatchers and operators

   the calling of stations by the des-
patcher while conversation is being carried
on with other stations saves time there is
greater accuracy in transmitting orders by
telephone as the despatcher writes down
each word as it is spoken instead of sending
it from memory by telegraph

   the improved line construction and
telephone apparatus available to-day is far
superior to that used even live years ago
it has been stated that all voices are not
transmitted equally well by telephone

  this is true but trouble from this
cause is seldom experienced and it will be
possible to obtain employees with suitable
voices easier than it is to get employees who
can send good morse

  the telegraph operator is subject to
paralysis of the arm there is not such
effect or any other physical trouble caused
by the continual use of the telephone and
its introduction enables many telegraph op-
erators already affected with paralysis but
otherwise efficient employees to continue to
carry on their work in a satisfactory manner

better for oprs

   the despatchers and the operators have
become better acquainted since using the
telephone and this has resulted in closer co-
operation in the performance of their work
the fact that they are talking with each
other seems to have eliminated the caustic
remarks and comments so frequently sent
by telegraph

   the remark of the despatcher after
u-ing the telephone for several months to
the effect that he  had not been mad once
since using the telephone  is well worth re-
peating as it indicates an improved condi-
tion by equipping trains with portable
telephone sets the despatcher may be reached
from any point between stations in case of
break-down

  mr harkness in speaking of some of the
advantages and disadvantages of the tele-
phone as compared with the telegraph has
said  the telephone messages are handled
at less exjense than by telegraph the
telephone operators handle as high as four
hundred and fifty messages a day and this
could be increased if the line were not used
so much for conversations

  for train-despatching service due con-

sideration must be given to the length of the
line the kind and size of wire the number
of stations connected to the line the kind of
telephone transmitter receiver induction-
coil and circuit together with the kind and
amount of current supplied says mr
harkness  the number of stations con-
nected to lines now in service varies from
ten to forty-four

    in regular commercial telephone service
there are usually but two people talking or
listening on the line at the same time while
in despatching service it is customary to
have from three to five operators in addi-
tion to the despatcher all connected to the
line at the same time and in addition an
unknown number of other stations listen-
ing to their conversation

there is no standard

  various methods of rendering efficient
service under these severe conditions have
been proposed and tried some have at-
tempted to equalize the telephonic current
passing through the receivers at the various
stations others have increased the volume
of transmission and still others by a com-
bination of the two have attempted to se-
cure more satisfactory results

   in some cases increased volume of
transmission has been accomplished at an
increase in battery consumption and a de-
crease in clearness of articulation in
others the volume of transmission has been
decreased to obtain clearer articulation

    the great difficulty is that there is no
standard no two users of a telephone will
agree as to the relative volume of articula-
tion obtained on two different circuits
even with skilled observers differences in
volume of transmission are often taken for
differences in quality of articulation and
vice versa or the amount of difference when
judged in per cent will vary within a wide
range a comparison of a laboratory stand-
ard and a working line is a physical im-
possibility if the tests are to be made by the
same parties and under the same conditions

will not supersede telegraphy

   comparisons made by obseving the
service on one line and then several days
later observing the service on the same or
different line cannot be considered fair
further changes in atmospheric or physical
conditions may occur in an instant
despatching trains by telephone



  mr harkness estimates the cost of equip-
ping a railroad with telephones at about one
hundred dollars per mile

  g w dailey superintendent of tele-
graph of the chicago and northwestern in
the railroad age-gazette for october 
 contributes a long article in which
he gives minute details of the experience of
his road with the telephone although mr
dailey reports very favorably of the tele-
phone for railroad work he says that  there
is an erroncous impression that the telephone
may soon supersede and replace the tele-
graph entirely this will not happen in
your time or mine on the two districts
equipped while we are using the telephone
for train-movement business we have re-
tained the telegraph for ordinary messages
and commercial business

   for years the telephone has filled a minor
but nevertheless important place in the
communication system of the chicago and
northwestern as well as other roads its
principal uses in the past have been in
connecting up outlying switches with the
telegraph offices small stations with the
telegraph stations connecting roundhouses
and coal-sheds and in the larger yards
connecting various switch-shanties scales
ice-houses and roundhouses with the yard-
masters office the chicago terminal has
been a good illustration of the service

  this yard system has proved of untold
value in handling the terminal business
and could not now be dispensed with the
same system on a smaller scale has been in
use in clinton boone and other yards of
the chicago and northwestern for several
years

the errors are few

  many important instructions are issued
by the chicago and northwestern opera-
tors and hundreds of car numbers and ini-
tials are handled over these yard telephone
lines every day the errors and misunder-
standings have been so few and the opera-
tion of these-yard lines so successful that it
had quite a bearing on the proposed ex-
tending of the telephone on that road

  it also served to demonstrate the supe-
riority of the telephone due to its greater
speed and flexibility as well as to the fact
that any yardmaster yard-clerk or ordi-
nary employee can use it to equal advan-
tage and does not have to look for a teleg-
rapher to do his talking for him

in handling train-orders by telephone

   	r r

on the chicago and northwestern all rules
and regulations governing train movements
remain the same as under the telegraph
no rules or practises have been changed

  the orders as delivered to conductors
and engineers are just the same in form
appearance and every particular as they
have been and are handled exactly the
same as heretofore in issuing a train-
order the despatcher after calling the sta-
tions he wants proceeds with his order in
the same form and formula as if by tele-
graph

  the names of all stations conductors
train and engine numbers and the time are
first pronounced plainly then spelled out
letter by letter and the figures duplicated
naming each figure separately

  when speaking the order the despatcher
is writing it in his record-book which is
considered quite a material safeguard
over the telegraph practise

type of telephone orders

  when he has finished speaking and wri-
ting he is ready for the repeating by the
operators this reduces his speed of con-
versation to his own ability to write it
down and also gages the speed for the re-
ceiving operator out on the line and does
not unnecessarily hurry him the oper-
ators repeat the orders back to the des-
patcher in the same way giving the  x 
acknowledgment as heretofore

  all operators listen to each other there-
by checking each other the despatcher
underscores each word and figure in his
record-book as it is being repeated by each
operator

  following are two illustrations of tele-
phone orders the hyphenated words and
figures are spelled out letter by letter the
orders as delivered do not show these spa-
cings or brackets which are merely used
for this illustration

  in reporting trains to a despatcher it is
claimed that no calling is necessary-
operators merely take receiver off the hook
speak die name of their station and go
ahead with their business the despatcher
being cut in continuously hears them
gives his acknowledgment and the trans-
action is completed

quicker handling claimed

  the despatcher writes his order in his
record-book as he speaks it and so is all
ready for the repeat when lie is through
speaking the operators can then talk it
back to him as fast as they can do so dis-
tinctly and plainly

  it is claimed that counting the time
saved in calling and quicker repetitions
the result is that orders and  s  are
handled about fifty per cent quicker than
by telegraph

  this means that the despatcher can dis-
pose of his work that much faster lias
more time to figure out movements and
meeting-points and can handle a great
many more trains on his trick and handle
them more promptly thereby greatly facil-
itating train movements

  several railroads claim that it further
places the despatcher in closer touch with
all the litde details of his daily work and
in closer touch with his men out on the
line

  the chicago and northwestern has ob-
served that there has been a decided im-
provement in the work and deportment of
the men out on the line due to the fact
that the conversation between the despatch-
es operators and other employees are of
a much more personal character than when
obtained by telegraph resulting in closer
working relations and more pleasant coop-
eration

talking vs writing

  it is more as if they were facing each
other and they dont feel like indulging
in some of the choice remarks that used to
fly over the telegraph wire when some one
would lose his temper

  it is human nature not to feel quite so
brave when one is talking directly to you

   the chicago and northwestern states
 that it has had instances where derailments
 or other accidents have occurred and the
 despatcher being able to converse directly
 with the conductor on the ground and the
 conductor being able to explain things in
 his own way more has been accomplished
 in ten minutes than could have been done
 by telegraph in an hour under the same
 conditions

   many a first-class railroad man like
 many other mortals can talk better than
 lie can write the telephone permits him
 to talk while the telegraph forces him to
 write

   on the chicago and northwestern each
 superintendent has a telephone on his desk
 connected with the despatching line he
 can listen in or talk with any or all of his
 stations at any time he can himself
 check up any slackness and keep in close
 personal touch with everything which is
 not otherwise possible unless the superin-
 tendent is a telegrapher and this is not
 always the case

   there is a worthy and charitable side to
 the telephone in railroading it has opened
 up an avenue of employment for injured
 railroad men who make first-class block-
 operators or statiorragents

   it should likewise open up a future ave-
 nue for young conductors to become train-
 despatchers should they so desire there
 are many young conductors who ought to
 make first - class train - despatchers and
 under telephone operation it would be a
 comparatively easy matter for them to do
 so as they usually have the necessary ex-
 perience and all the requirements except
 the ability to telegraph

lightening burdens

   the train-despatchers according to all
 reports that the writer of this article has
 received are all enthusiastic over the tele-
 phone as it lightens their many burdens
 to a considerable extent and we all know
 they have burdens enough to carry

   the chicago and northwestern states
 that another important feature in the use
 of the telephone for train-despatching is
 the fact that it works as good if not better
 in bad or foggy weather this is just the
 reverse of the telegraph no instruments
 out of adjustment and  operator break-
 ing in the middle of an order with a string
 f dots like a gatling gun trying to adjust
despatching trains by telephone



 himself  the telephone remains in adjust-
 ment in any kind of weather the signal-
 ing apparatus may be affected but the
 telephone will not be

  says mr dailey

   the telephone is decidedly a step in
advance in the method of handling trains
more trains can be handled in a given
time prompter movements can be made
emergencies handled and controlled quicker
and better everybody is placed in closer
touch with each other and it is just as safe
as the telegraph if not safer for such pur-
poses

    when telegraph orders were first intro-
duced the first train and engine men hand-
ling them were afraid of them and did
not want to use them now we would not
be without them

  although the officials of only a few
roads have been quoted in this article
there are as has been said before over
fifty-five american railroads using the tel-
ephone for despatching trains over a mile-
age of  miles and more the santa
fe to-day is said to have the largest mile-
age under telephone and is rapidly putting
the whole system under such control it is
understood that the whole harriman sys-
tem is doing the same thing

the telegraphsuses

  the pennsylvania and the new york
central have found the telephone so useful
for despatching that its use is being extend-
ed as rapidly as possible on these great sys-
tems in fact it looks as if despatching
trains by telephone will in a very few years
be the universal practise of this country
and of canada

   it will be noted that i say  despatching
trains by telephone this does not mean
that the telegraph is doomed for there
are many other uses for the telegraph be-
sides despatching and as mr dailey says
there is an errdneous impression that the
telephone may soon supersede and replace
the telegraph entirely but this will not
happen in your time or mine

  take the associated press reports for
instance as any newspaper man knows
the telegraph is in no danger of being re-
placed by the telephone in such service and
especially by the ordinary commercial tele-
phone any newspaper man who has had
to take news by telephone or handle it as
laid down on the desk by telegraph will not

worry much about the future of the tele-
graph or about the telegraph operators job

  train despatching is only a small part
of communicating by wire and electricity
the cheapness and reliability of the tele-
graph makes it a standby where the tele-
phone so far is not practical

value of new things

   the telephone is to the telegraph even in
railroad work what the electric car is to
the steam locomotive the trolley-car has
not put the locomotive out of business and
the telephone cannot put the telegraph out
of business 

  every change in machinery raises a mis-
guided protest from the misinformed it
was so when the metal plowshares super-
seded the forked stick down to the time
when the repeating rifle made the muzzle
loader useless

  the introduction of the locomotive has
increased the demand for horses the tele-
graph has increased the demand on the mail
sendee and a telegraph operator worrying
over the introduction of the telephone in
railroad work is much like a mail clerk in
the last century saying good-by to his job
because of that new-fangled dangerous
unreliable affair the telegraph that no-
body ever used before

  the telephone in railroad despatching
according to the reports given to the writer
by various railroads has the following
in its favor over telegraphing

   	it is faster by from  to  per cent

   	it is fully as safe if not safer than
telegraphing

  	it opens a channel to railroad em-
ployees injured in other lines of work who
without the telephone could not earn a
living

  	it enables a train to communicate
with the despatcher from between stations
which is an invaluable thing in a wreck

  	it enables any one to send informa-
tion in an emergency to the despatcher or
lo take the station agents place tempora-
rily say in case of sudden sickness at a
remote point

  	it prevents any combination of men
from limiting the supply of labor that is
necessary with which to run a railroad and
tends to remove the liability of strikes

  	it is extending the usefulness of a
great invention and advances the world
one more step
that night with mitzler

       by robert fulkerson hoffman

          an unexpected demand by the call-boy
          and what it did for a boomer fireman

mitzler was drunk-tired
nasty fighting drunk
there was no denying
that and on the other
t hand nobody reported it
to division headquarters
why  there are several reasons but chief-
ly two in particular

  if a homeless man battles his way over a
hundred-mile division sweating and blis-
tering close back of a locomotive fire-door
if he doggedly heaves half a car-load of soft
coal from the tender into the fierce-flaming
fire-box with skill and exactness while the
engine-deck careens drunkenly under his
tired feet if his seared eyes search unfail-
ingly betimes into the blackness of the
night that he may not fail to call to his
watchful mate across the cab  white 
when the semaphore says  white or
 green  when it says  green or  red 
when it says commandingly red and if
with all this and the multitude of unnamed
soul-searing things which fill the moments
of a heavy run with freight he is patient
even cheerful he will have won his first
degree in the freemasonry which is the rail-
road mans most jealous possession

  that is one reason why mitzler was not
reported

  the other chief reason is this when a
man has done all of these things in a day
and done them well no seasoned man of
decent instincts will say that it is not
enough and when the sudden demand is
made for more no man who rightly bears
the name goes far aside to bear a tale
against the man who for the once found
erring falls a little short

  this is true though fellow-feeling must
not override a rule and whisky always
must remain taboo upon the rail

  nobody was more bitterly aware of this
than mitzler whisky had made him a
boomer and a tramp before he had drifted
into the clear upper air of pelaya again
and again he had stood unsteadily gripping
the hand-railing in front of the call-board
in some roundhouse of the crowded lines of
the middle west and stared shamefacedly
through bloodshot eyes while his name was
wiped finally from the board

  again and again he had gone out to dwell
in the gutters and the filth of things until
summoning the latent manhood and the
saving laughter which were in his heart and
would not yet consent to die he stood up
shook free of the deadly thing and won
his insistent way to another berth a little
farther on notwithstanding the ominous
gaps in his  clearance  which would have
barred a man less prepossessing

  in one of these reconstructive periods he
had drifted into the high country beyond
the great plains in the summer night that
brought him to the base of the mountains
he lay prone upon his back in the bottom
of an empty coal car while the wheels
drummed out their dull funereal march
on the lonely bridge across purgatory
river

  the roar of the engine toiling ceaselessly
at the front came back to him through the
narrowing gorge the gurgling waters of
the river seemed briefly to voice the mute
accusation of the bright stars above him
and the insistent voice of the laboring en-
gine became a thunderous denunciation of
his wasted days

  mitzler was feeling very much alone and
ashamed

  then while the train wound slowly up-
ward through the turnings of the pass great
banks of cloud welled up above the rnoun-
that night with mitzler



tain-tops and slowly blotted out the ac-
cusing stars the voice of the babbling river
was hushed in the distance below and
the shouted reproach from the engine was
dulled and hushed in the depths of the
gorge while mitzler fell into the troubled
sleep of the outcast on the wing

  when he awoke late in that summer night
the train was standing in the dense dark-
ness of pelaya yards great drops of rain
were falling on his face and striking dully
in the coal - dust on the car floor he
clambered over the side made his stum-
bling way across the network of tracks
and presently stood in the middle of the

way out into the night and toward the low
rampart of cliff which stands close guard
above the town

  when he had gained a sheltered place be-
neath the beetling rocks he sat down and
listened to the rumbling of the storm gath-
ering closer in the mountains suddenly
it broke and fell about his retreat in sheets
and columns of rain shot through and
glaringly illumined by lightning flashes of
vivid white and nearer gleams of blinding
flame

  the mountainside sprang into quick life
with rills and little hurrying torrents a
rattlesnake drowned out of its den glided

only lighted room that fronted pelavas
main street

  he clutched in the depths of his ragged
jeans the last two-bit piece that he pos-
sessed and halted waveringly for a mo-
ment between pungent-smelling bar on the
one hand and appetizing lunch-counter on
the other

  the lure of food prevailed he fiercely
thrust the bit of silver on the counter and
ate to the limit of its purchasing power he
walked to the door and looked across to-
ward the lights flitting about the round-
house he turned back and surveyed his
grimy and bedraggled appearance in the
mirror above the bar then he took his

suddenly out upon the dry ledge where
mitzler sat he sprang to his feet and as
it writhed toward him and before it could
coil and strike he kicked it far out from
the ledge and saw its yellow writhing folds
fall swiftly through a glare of light into the
depths

   that does for you  he muttered as he
sank back upon the rock shaken with the
horror of the thing  this town must have
heard about me judgin by the celebration
its puttin up

  thats what ill do he declared
aloud amid the rumbling of thunders
among the rocks his eyes followed the
course of the rattlesnakes flight ill

there it is on the clock whats the matter   replied the waiter


the railroad mans magazine

kick loose from the whole boomer business
and clean up 

  he rose with a determined start he
pressed out the dents from his battered hat
loosed his shoes and divesting himself of
his garments one by one until he stood
naked thrashed the grime of many wan-
derings from them upon the rock walls of
his shelter then he stepped out into the
torrent of falling rain and completed his
regeneration before he laid down to sleep
and await the coming of morning

  that was the real coming of mitzler to
pelaya nobody but himself knew any-
thing more about that than they knew about
the deadly secret battle which he fought for
the mastery of himself in the months that
followed

  he won steadily from the morning after
the storm when he went into the master
mechanics office smiling above the insist-
ent demands of an empty stomach and se-
cured a place on the call-board until that
wild-eyed winter night when he came on
the engine drunk and showed a private
pelaya audience a different sort of mitzler

  that was the one night when mitzler
was undeniably drunk and indeed the
only time in pelaya that there was any pos-
sibility of his being so until then he had
not again touched the stuff which he wanted
and feared with all his soul

  it was christmas eve with the sun gone
down and the keen upper air nipping and
searing every exposed thing in the early
darkness

  the yards were a dirty brown of tram-
pled snow and beyond and above the spot-
less white of the vast slopes led steeply
dimly upward to the circling mountain-
heads the myriad stars were again hold-
ing high conclave but among their bril-
liant company there was no accusing eye for
mitzler

  there seemed to him instead a sort of
benediction which found material expres-
sion in the resonant voice of big jim ma-
halie as they crossed the yards together
homeward bound

  once more we fought em through the
hills eh mitzler said mahalie with a
triumphant glance toward the headless
train of freight stretching dimly away into
the night where they had just left it

   once more replied mitzler briefly

  nine hours fight with the battle front
stretched through snow - banks from del
sur to pelaya and seven hundred tons a

coming any man that wants more than
that is a glutton what mahalie ran on
cheerily its enough aint it

   enough agreed mitzler with an ab-
stracted smile

  matter old man demanded maha-
lie aint going to turn blue for christ-
mas are you say he added quickly as
he read something of the rightness of his
guess in a swift glance at the firemans
face youre to come up to my house for
christmas dinner to-morrow its the last
thing my wife said to me when we started
out on the run

   come up and help play with the young
ones well have more fun than you could
dump out of a cart he finished while shift-
ing various mysterious bundles under his
arms

   all right much obliged replied
mitzler with a lonesome sort of laugh
 thatll be the finest ever guess im some
tired to-night but you can look for me
fresh as spring grass to-morrow

  then mahalie went his eager homeward
way mitzler with a quiet  good night
betook himself rather pensively to a lonely
supper in the only place that always showed
a welcoming light in any hour of pelayas
darkest night

  he pushed the door open and entered
responding quietly to a varied greeting
he had no mood for companionship the
pride of the six months of his regeneration
had slipped away for the moment he had
come suddenly to that partial collapse of
spirit which sometimes falls upon an over-
wearied man who permits himself to look
backward to a somber past

  he was at heart again the derelict the
friendless outcast the bleak loneliness of
whose condition stood forth within himself
only the more clearly because of the at-
tempted good cheer of mahalies making
and the good-fellowship around him

  he observed all of the unwritten niceties
of the place quite exactly by hanging his
cap upon a hook in the wall and placing his
rolled overalls under the chair when he seat-
ed himself at a table apart from the hila-
rious group at the bar and the quieter line
at the lunch-counter

  he ate heartily of the substantial meal
which was served him glancing furtively
now and then toward the glistening array
of bottles back of the bar which in the
months past he had taken a savage joy in
regarding as beaten foes
that night with mitzler	s

missouri that cares
a peck of cliilli-
cothe gravel wheth-
er im corned or
sober ill take
one and go to bed

  say he called
imperatively to a
passing waiter

  but w h e n the
man lined up be-
side him with his
hand dropped fa-
miliarly upon his
shoulder mitzler
only reached again
toward his overalls
and asked lamely

  what time is it

   there it is on the clock
matter watch stopped
waiter as he hurried away with a grin

  the odor of mixed drinks swirled about
mitzler in the wake of the waiters hurried
going the shining array of bottles glis-
tened invitingly and the musical tinkle of
glasses mingled with many-keyed laughter
close at hand

  he dirust die bundle back to its place
beneath his chair and called again

  jose bring me an unbroken bottle

to

whats the
replied the

the door with no word of greeting or fare-
well to any who passed

  he swung the door wide and bumped
full into the call-boys swinging lantern

  whoap exclaimed the boy youre
called sign right here under  coon  con-
nor youre goin with him on extra 
west 

  yes i am rejoined mitzler staring
blankly get out he added roughly
shoving the boy aside  im just in im
going to bed

  sign snarled the call-boy lunging

sign right here

under coon 
connor 

  he gulped the last of his muddy coffee
and groped aimlessly with one hand under
his chair in search of his bundled overalls
then he suddenly loosed his hold of them
and sat bolt upright

  what does it matter he ground out
through his clenched teeth  there aint
a soul north of georgia nor west of die

  of bourbon hurry he ordered with a
blaze of light in his eyes which admitted of
no denial

  when it had come - when jose over-
friendly had volunteered his glib admoni-
tion of  go to it bo-there aint a head-
ache in a barl of it mitzler poured a
measure of it in a glass and held it gloat-
ingly to the light

                he reveled in the golden
              gleam of its amber fire and
              set it down and poured an
              added depth before he raised
              it hungrily to his lips

                he drained it at a gulp
             and poured again and drank
             then he seized his bundle
             paid his score and strode to
s

the railroad mans magazine

back with his book you got to sign or
git turned in whats the use hollering
 shut the door  yelled somebody as the
icy blast smote the revelers at the bar
dye think its summer

  mitzler signed and turned his face to the
steady bitter wind that swept across the
tracks while the clear sleepless stars
blinked gravely on his halting footsteps
through the yards

  coon connor engineer had two hob-
bies and he was there with both of them
when mitzler arrived at the engine already
coupled to its train

  first he wore from october to may a
close-fitting skull-cap of yellow-gray sable
which rumor avowed had been made by
himself from some old furs of his wifes
coon never made any declaration about it
except that it brought him luck he would
run a minute late leaving any station to tell
that

  second he believed that sheeps tallow
was a sure cure for hot pins and he re-
ligiously carried a carefully wrapped pound
of it to and from the engine

you sure do win ip i can help you

  he was stowing the sheeps tallow ex-
actly in the right place in the tender tool-
box when mitzler climbed up the gangway
when he had fixed it to his satisfaction he
drew his sable cap down more deeply over
his ears and essayed to be cheerful but
mitzler would not have it so

   so youre the engineer eh   he de-
manded great big engineer

   sure replied connor cheerfully
why wouldnt i be

   well leme have a look at this gine i
want to put her in my pocket sneered
mitzler dont get in the way fellow
im goin to put some of a fire in this ma-
chine just watch me 

  connor watched him for the space of
three pulse-beats and understood it was
becoming rare but he had seen a man
quickly turn drunk on a short call in the
high country

  he knew the signs and therefore dropped
down and went quietly about his oiling

   in a little while the whistle sent its start-
ing call screeching and rasping up among
the ice-locked peaks and they were away

for the long bat-
tle with the hills
on the weary way
of mitzlers recent
coming sullenly
but well he fought
his fight with the
fire and patient-
ly connor bore
with his bitter-
tonguecl question
or reply

  had the night
been worn a lit-
tle farther on the
heavy labors of
the run it might
have fared easier
for mitzler but
the climax came
too soon he was
still heady with
the bourbon
which he had
taken when they
arrived at the first
lone water - tank
secluded in its
rough-hewn niche
beside a ledge of
shelving rock

  in the great
that night with mitzler



white silence of the christinas peace that
had stolen upon the world while the had
fought their way thus far among the beet-
ling crags and the starved wild things that
prowled hungrily among them connor
stopped there for water on the one side
was the tank standing darkly against the
rock wall on the other side the bench of
snow-covered rock at the level of the cab
window

  mitzler sprang from his seat at the win-
dow as the engine stopped him directly be-
side the sloping rock

  his eyes were staring for want of sleep
but there was a terror in them also which
was not born of that

   hey did you see that he yelled at
connors back

  see what replied connor drawing
in his sable-clad head from the window

   then mitzlers eyes w-idened in a greater
fright as he sprang back with a smothered
cry upon the seat-box from which he had
hastily come

  thats a shine hat for a white man to
wear he announced while he fumbled
nervously with the shaker-bar caught up
in his leap  i can see hats like that any
place i look seen one out here on the
snow just now and i spose the woods is
full of them why dont you get a bear-
skin while youre at it huh  

  thatll be all about that hat pard-
ner answered connor touched to the
quick  if you dont like it you can al-
ways get off and walk you know take
water and never mind me will you

  yes ill take water and ill be right
with her as long as you can pull that throt-
tle out of the back door replied mitzler
dont you never worry none about me
hombre 

  connor caught up his oil-cans without
further ado lifted the lid of the tender
tool-box took out the precious packet of
tallow and went below with it under his
arm while the swirling wind wafted the
rancid smell of it across the cab and out
over the snow of the rock-shelf

  mitzler allowed the shaker-bar to- slip
easily back to its place on the deck he
slipped down quickly after it and stepping
across the lap-sheet and through the opened
coal - gates began climbing through the
loose coal toward the back of the tender
he had gained only half the height of the
hopper when he stopped and said

  oh youre up there are you thought

you went down to oil around you goin to
take water

  there was no answer but the whistling
of the wind among the rock pines

  say why dont you answer will you
take it or wont you he demanded

  then two close-set gleams of greenish
fire seemed to shoot out from under what
he thought was connors cap and a screech-
ing smothered growl was wafted down to
him on a swirl of wind

  he began backing numbly through the
mass of yielding coal under his feet clutch-
ing automatically behind him for the sha-
ker-bar which though uppermost in his
mind was all too far away

  just when he had reached the lap-sheet
without turning connors yellow-gray head
appeared low at the gangway as he shouted
up through the cold blast

  what you yelling about mitzler
was that you made that noise

  at sight of the cap below him mitzler
let out an inarticulate yell of sheer terror
and as the odor of the open tallow-packet
in connors hands was wafted up more
strongly than ever from below mitzlers
cry was answered from the tender

  the sound rose from a low wailing moan
like the sobbing of the wind through trees
at night mounting swiftly to a shrill
and piercing cry of direst menace while
mitzler stood clutching aimlessly behind
him and looking dully from connors head
at the gangway up to the blazing points of
living fire in the darkness at the tenders
top

  a second piercing cry cut the bitter cold
air more insistently than before and while
it still rang among the rocks a lithe yellow-
gray body shot out of the darkness above
him and launched itself full at mitzlers
breast

  instinctively he leaped aside and caught
up the bar which he had been seeking blind-
ly the brute crashed against the loose fix-
tures of the boiler-head tray and for a mo-
ment enmeshed itself in the swinging slack
of the fire-door chain

  screaming and snarling under the swift
blows which mitzler was now raining upon
it the great claws of the thing shot out in
lightning play ripping his clothing to
shreds while the heavy cushioned paws
buffeted him back and forth in the narrow
space of the cab

  the double row of fierce white teeth
flashed and snapped in the dull cab light


the railroad mans magazine

in furious onslaught on the chain which
encumbered the beast and the fire-door
which cruelly seared it

  there were dark stains of red growing
broadly down the front of mitzlers faded
suit of blue when connor leaped into the
fray from the side with heavy hammer and
wrench aiming swift-following blows from
his wiry arms

  with a last desperate screaming strug-
gle the mountain cat freed itself from the
ensnaring chain and crouched for an in-
stant under the ceaseless blows half-
stupefied by the beating it missed its spring
by ever so little and struck glancingly the
water-glass on the boiler-head as its heavy
body shot past mitzler and brought up
with a muffled crash upon his seat-box

  the quick puff of scalding water instant-
ly turned to steam from the open cocks the
sputtering roar from the broken glass and
the mingled veils of die men and the raven-
ous cat drowned the crashing of the cab
glass through which the animal leaped-
and was gone

  ten seconds-perhaps twice that-who
could tell-had seen it all when they
had stopped the broken fixtures and bound
up mitzlers flesh wounds there was litth
of explanation made to the others of the
train-crew and they were again upon their
way

  except for the occasional call of signals
silence prevailed between connor and mitz-
ler in the hours of darkness yet remaining
on the run when the pallid winter sun had
ushered in the christmas day with spears
of brilliant light upon the snow - capped
pines the train had won its way to azul del
norte at the mountains crest it lay there
in the vast stillness waiting for the speed-
ing limited from the west

  just back from the tracks centered in
a little plaza rimmed about with pinoii
pines stood a modest adobe chapel sending
out from its diminutive spire the high clear
notes of a bell in early call to sleepy
brown-faced villagers

  for a little space after the engine had
come to rest upon the siding mitzler stood
in the gangway and connor leaned from the
window in spite of the biting cold listening
to the appeal of the bell for  peace on earth
good-will to men

  swarthy huddled figures were hurrying
in response to disappear through the low
wide door of the chapel the picture was
one of humble peace and joy and hope

   how long do you reckon well lay here
for the limited mitzler suddenly asked
out of the silence which held between the
men on the engine

  maybe as much as twenty minutes
maybe more replied connor dispassion-
ately

  ill go over into the doby town for a
spell announced mitzler hitching the
rents in his clothing together and tighten-
ing up the bits of wire with which he had
roughly laced them

  w-e- replied connor rather du-
biously then brightening he added
hopefully better get yourself some good
liniment and rub up them cuts in your legs
and face some before we pull out do you
good

  ill get me something better answered
mitzler

    all right said connor with a decisive
wag of the head  but make good and sure
you dont pull the wrong package for ive
had a mans plenty of rough house for this
trip

  he shoved the cab sash shut with a bang
and mitzler dropped down and departed
without answering

  straight to the chapel he went lifting
the quaint bronze latch he entered and
stood cap in hand just within the door and
set his aching back against it

  his sleepless weary eyes followed the
naked narrow aisle down through the sub-
dued light until they rested upon the calm
face rising above the black robes of the
padre

   mitzler entering silently had come upon
the lifting of the host he looked upon
the reverent upturned swarthy faces and
then upon the bowed and kneeling figures
clustering thickly among the poor wooden
benches ranged on either side of the bare
aisle

  when the sacred emblem had gone slow-
ly aloft and then as slowly had been with-
drawn he-seized the moment of deep si-
lence following to walk straightway down
the aisle until jie stood before the padre in
the little chancel

  with his marred face and disheveled
clothing his weary stoop and his sleepless
stare he was a sorry apparition to appear
in that sacred moment of a brown mans
service upon which no white man had ever
before intruded there are many places
where more of pomp and less of reverence
reign from which his ignominious ejection
that night with mitzler



   keep it my son replied die padre as
the semblance of a fleeting smile crossed
his severely kind face keep it among
your running orders it will hold you closer
in the night and if ever the battle is too
hard will you come again to me

      i will said mitzler soberly
    and ill win

      he thrust the parchment into the
    depths of his blouse and when his
    hand came forth it held a shining
    piece of gold coin he laid it on the

wafted down to him

on a swirl of wind

must have quickly followed but not so
here

  the padre long accustomed to meet and
satisfy the crying needs of poor humanity
as best he might was well able to meet a

a smothered growl was

man as he might meet him he read be-
neath the surface of mitzlers haggard face
and saw a man

  he stilled by the simple lifting of his
hand a rising murmur of surprise which
was rapidly growing into a subdued com-
posite voice of resentment from the benches

  what is it my son why have you
come among us at this time

have you the pledge asked mitzler
squarely meeting the questioning eyes
the pledge of what asked the padre
 the pledge thatll mind me always of
this day and that ill drink no more re-
plied mitzler

  without a word the padre drew him into
an alcove of the chancel there he laid
before him a square of parchment upon
which were traced in script the simple sol-
emn words that should bind him to his
resolve shortly it was done and mitzler
asked in boyish candor

   do you keep this order or do i  

small table beside which they stood and
said

   i make it my offering for the day and
the cause

  then he passed quietly out of the chan-
cel up through the dim aisle and out into
the bright glare of the early morning
walking quickly to the engine he glanced
at the frost-whitened cab window behind
which he knew connor would be dozing
he climbed up and connor turned with a
sleepy stare

  i win announced mitzler

  a labored smile struggled for expression
upon his stiffened face it crinkled the
corners of his glassy eyes and puckered the
dull-red claw-marks on his cheek until they
broke and bled afresh he was not good
to see and connor stared at him with a
look that was little short of aversion

  you win what he demanded pivot-
ing round upon his seat-box until he square-
ly faced mitzler


the railroad mans magazine

   i win out  answered mitzler quite un-
perturbed and handing over his parchment
to connor   coon im a lot sorry that
i wolfed it with you all night i am i
thought i was goin to bed took one or
two-

  i know-i know connor broke in
while his eyes ran rapidly over the brief
document

  then his face relaxed and shone with a
glad light under the even coat of grime
connor was not a man of much speaking
all he said was this

  you sure do win if i can help any

and its christmas now or was a while ago
according to the bell over there i reckon
its here yet shake

  the limited came roaring up over the
crest behind a spume of powdery snow that
spouted to either side high above its pilot
it shot past them a brilliant flash of
tuscan red in a shimmering mist of unsul-
lied snow crystals and then the way was
clear for them to drop their somber train of
freight down through the twisted white lane
among the snow-laden pines to del sur
and what it held of christmas cheer for
them

left behind

  oh sir my box-the black one there
 oh would you be so kind

 its all i have in this wide world

 and that is left behind

 i pulled the rope and number twelve
 backed slowly to her place

 i cant forget that oblong box

 nor indeed that ladys face

 now if things that lose their owners

 all our sympathies so bind

 how much more should living creaturcs
 who forlorn are left behind

 see the dog in some strange city

 who has lost his master kind

 i confess an honest pity
 for a cur thats left behind

 with his nose upon the pavement

 how he threads the mighty throng

 lifting anxious eyes to faces

 whining out his lonely song

 kicked and cuffed by every idler

 set upon by his own kind

 i could hang the man who strikes him
 a poor dog thats left behind

 for i cant forget the school-days

 those first days at abbott lawn

 when the shadow of a mother
 that bent oer me was withdrawn

 or the utter desolation

 the despair that filled my mind

 when she left me with the master

 left her little boy behind

 so i pitied this poor lady

 traveling alone that night

 with the box that held her wardrobe

 scarce a dozen pounds in weight

 seeking friends in some great city

 or a lover there to find

 or perchance a friendless maiden

 whom love had left behind

 so i turned my brake and fixed it

 then looked her up a seat

 gave the fire an overhauling

 then sat down to warm my feet

 and my heart went toward that lady

 for her weeping made me blind

 so i went and sat beside her

 though i left a wife behind

 by this time we reached the station

 i believe i touched my hat

 when the lady came and asked me-
 would i have an eye to that

 i expect to meet my brother

 if the telegram went through

 then-she sobbed-hell come and get it
 with many thanks to you

 henry tristan our conductor

 now came through the crowded train

 and i told him why i signaled

 and we both went back again

 taking up the oblong bundle

 we could find no plain address

 so we put it by for orders
 to return by next express

but that  order never reached us
and that brother never came

so	i took that bundle with me
and it found a home and name
hes as bright a little youngster
and as pretty as youll find-

but my wife will never tell you
how that boy was left behind

lost

by w j carney

the true story series the old overland trail between

the missouri river and california was alive with hair-breadth escapades
before the railroad came many and close were the encounters with the
indians many a peaceful farm was the scene of a miniature battle and many
a budding town was looted and the inhabitants routed this story by mr
carney a member of old troop m shows the marvelous fighting methods of
the sioux and the wonderful heroism of the old-time stage-drivers

true story number fifty-one

the night that ned baker started out for julesburg colorado from
fort sedgwick with the united states mail and three
passengers on his old concord coach

whe union pacific had its tracks
  laid as far as fort sedgwick
  colorado territory - but on
  the opposite side of the
  platte the new town of
  julesburg had sprung up in a
  night and the old town four miles away
  was deserted this was back in 

  it was at diis station that ned baker
who drove the overland stage for holliday
 butterfield used to stop what is it that
made stage drivers real men they were
a breed i themselves

  thirty-three years ago dressed in army-
blue i sat on a united states cavalry horse
and raised my hat in lone salute to him
of all the men who ever pressed a brake

drew the ribbons over a wheel or threw the
silk into a wild team ned baker was the
bravest and the best

  the indians were on the war-path all
along the platte they were more bold
than ever this year they had chased a
freighting outfit so close to denver as to be
seen by the people living on what is now
capitol hill of that city where stands the
colorado state capitol building

  one coach was set upon just out of fort
morgan forty miles below denver the dri-

wanted it to make lance-heads and arrow-
points

  we heard at fort sedgwick that same
afternoon that seven or eight hundred in-
dians were seen crossing the platte between
antelope station and the fort black jack
our scout and five of our men had seen
them from where they were hid watching
a bunch of antelope and jack said they were
sioux

   as they crossed to the eastern side of the
river all the scouts and the overland stage
people decided that the long-threatened raid
along the river had come baker with his
coach was to go through the fort at six
oclock that evening on the way to denver
as there were no orders as yet to give him
an escort general potter tried to persuade
him not to take his coach through that
night but he might as well have tried to
stop the river from running

    hostiles or no hostiles general said
xed baker quietly the coach goes
through

the long-threatened raid

  four passengers-three men and one lady
-were in the coach that night i shall al-
ways remember how ned baker looked as
he stepped up to the open door of his old
concord coach a general addressing his
army just before going into battle could not
have looked more dignified he took off
his wide-brimmed hat laid his hand on the
sill of the window and with a polite bow
said

   i hear my old friends the sioux are
good and plenty up the road i must go over
to-night i do not want to take you into
danger and not tell you here at the fort
you are safe but when you get one mile
away from here you must take your
chances we may not be molested and we
roav have to fight if you stay here vou can
take any of the other coaches for your tick-
ets are good for the number of miles you
paid for 

  of course if any of you come with me
to-night i will do my best to land you in
denver but mind if attacked we must
fight our way through or be -calped now
it rests witti you what you want to do

   well said one of the passengers sup-
pose we all remain here overnight

    that gentlemen is your own privilege
answered baker	

 of course you will pull out in the

morning as soon as it is light asked an-
other passenger

   baker looked straight at him and said
   as for me sir i pull out now

   why said the other if you have no
passengers vvhats the odds whether you go
on or not 

   its this way said baker i carry the
united states mail it must be delivered on
the other side of the rockies on time if
we allowed a little thing like this to stop
it old uncle sam would take away our
job

if i can said baker

  then you go through anyway asked
the passenger

   if i can smiled baker but the red-
skins may have something to say about that
we may lose our hair before morning
that being the case pard i go too
grimly said a third passenger

    yes broke in the young lady-who was
a miss cora evans- let us stick together
we started out together and let us go
through together

  baker looked up at her and said god
bless your pretty face lady youre the
right sort for this country but i could not
think of such a thing as allowing you to go
through with me to-night

    but why   she pleaded  i can shoot
see here my brother sent me these re-
volvers and a friend showed me how to use
them i am not afraid besides i must be
in black hawk at the appointed time-
and- she stopped blushing and con-
fused

   just then quartermaster both well and his
wife came up to the coach and took charge
of miss evans baker refused to let her go
into such danger as capture by the indians
unwillingly she stepped from the coach
her betrothed husband was expecting her in
black hawk a mining town in the rocky
mountains up behind denver

  the three men voted to go along with
baker and his messenger the army officers
filled the coach with joaded guns and hun- 
dreds of cartridges

  the sides of the holliday  butter-
field coaches were lined with sheet-iron as
baker climbed into his seat and sorted out
his reins we all cheered him and his brave
little crew the first stop was the fifteen-
mile ranch the next buffalo johns twen-
ty-eight miles above the fort

at one oclock that night just seven hours
how the julesburg mail was lost



after baker left the fort a pale-faced young
stock-tender came spurring a tired horse
down the road and was halted by the guard
at the upper end of the stables

  he asked for the commander the cor-
poral of the guard jumped onto a horse
bare-back and galloped with him to gen-
eral potters quarters the old general came
to the door in his night-shirt and listened to
the stock-tenders story

   indians have been seen for the last three
days general he said hovering on the
tops of the bluffs that line the river road
they ride down to the platte for water then
back again and it is plain theyre gathering
in large numbers for some devilish purpose

  this afternoon a large band two miles
above antelope station were riding their
ponies up and down the road as if on a
frolic or running races a little before sun-
down they crossed the platte and rode in full
view but out of rifle range and then disap-
peared toward the west

   i told baker about it while changing his
horses but he did not say much he had
not got more than a mile away when i was
sure i saw an indian on the top of the high
bluffs finally more came out to the point
i could see them from the station but i was
sure that ned could not see them from where
he was

  as sure as shooting general theyre go-
ing to attack the coach in the big sandy cut
i flopped on my pony and with my rifle
i rode as close as i dared to the horsemen
and listened i soon heard the firing-

  guns springfields  interrupted the
general

it was the big guns

  yes it was the loud report of the big
guns general-not six-shooters i rode far-
ther on and listened and there was no mis-
taking the report of the guns i judge there
was a good many of them i made up my
mind to see what was up so i rode down
toward the river and what is called snows
hay camp i kept that between the place
where i judged the fight to be and myself
it was just light enough for me to see and
sir the coach is there surrounded by in-
dians

  theres heaps of them and im afraid
general less theyre helped right soon there
wont be no one to help-

  corporal send for captain mix
quick  ordered the general

  in five minutes  boots and saddles  was
sounding from the parade-ground and tony
dawson the chief bugler was blowing that
famous old call through the open doors of
m troops barracks

  the boys were soon leading into line

   the hostiles have ambushed baker
theyve got the coach ran the whispered
news 

  silence in the ranks ordered the ser-
geant

  we knew that there was work ahead and
he knew that we would not all come back
yet every man in line was impatient to get
the command forward

  we had only twenty-seven men that night
as we rode out of the fort the rest of
troop m thirty-three men had gone up the
laramie road to mud springs where a
cattle-train was reported to be in trouble
they had been gone four days and as we
had heard it was more of a scare than any-
thing else the men were expected back at
any moment

we are off

  captain mix left word to send them right
along as soon as they got in and for them to
bring one days rations as we had nothing
except what could be grabbed up at the mo-
ment

  buttoning our uniforms we swept out of
the fort and down the road on a trot then
eager as the men the horses broke into a
run counting cut-offs baker and his coach
were twenty miles away we rode the first
ten miles in less than an hour it was quick
going for cavalry on a dark night

  there was no wind and a shot could be
heard a long way off we stopped and lis-
tened not a sound the mystic plains
were absolutely still was it all over were
we too late were we yet too far away to
hear the fight

  we allowed the horses to walk long
enough to catch their wind then sent them
along at a gallop again after keeping
this up half an hour a halt was made and
we listened-but not for long

  we heard the shots ahead and knew that
there was still some one alive and able to
shoot-but we were yet miles away we
left the road and the tired horses were start-
ed on a dead run this however was a
bad move for we had not gone more than
a half mile when ka-plunk joe matelys
horse went over and over the horses be-


the railroad mans magazine

hind him shied five more went down in
a tumble they kicked and snorted but one
only was injured and he had only a sprained
ankle a prairie dog hole had caused all
this mix up

  we got back to the road again where
there was no further danger of dog holes
and away we went

  the firing from the bend in the road
ahead was not as brisk as it should have
been if five men were handling the guns
those men were in a desperate place and
it might be all over before we could get
there

  captain mix though brave and cautious
was now running right into whatever might
be behind the big hill ahead how many
hundreds of indians were waiting for us
there we did not know perhaps there might
be several thousand-and of us there were
but twenty-nine the stock-tender had
come along with the old mans rifle

  we could see the top of the hill black
against the sky thexcaptain gave no
word of command but just before turning
the bend he raised his saber to halt we
stopped over the hill through the night
came the sound of the shots quickly and
noiselessly we gathered close around him
to the panting circle he said in a whisper

   there are not many of us and we dont
know how many indians there are around
the point of that bluff but we do know
that our help is needed i want you to
dash in and give them the best you have
all of you fight your way to the coach
if we would help them we must get to
them do you all understand  

hundreds were waiting

  we all heard and understood the
captain took the lead saying  come on
remember the coach is the rallying point

   except the soli thud of our horses hoofs
on the buffalo grass and those crying shots
there was not a sound as we rounded the
kiint of the bluff all the horses were in a
lope

  suddenly we got a full view of the sav-
ages great scott but there was a lot of
them the ground in front of us was cov-
ered with campfires in the dark beyond
faintly lit fay rifle flashes was the coach

  we swung around a small grass fire
which the indians had set in hopes of
burning or smoking out baker but hap-
pily the wind had taken it away from

them then we dipped into a little hollow
and up again in sight of it all

  between us and the coach and squarely
in our front was a dark seething mass of
indians they had not heard us we
did not wait for die order but sent our
horses on a run straight at them

  we lay low on our horses and dashed
 we were pretty close before they had
any idea that we were within fifty miles

the answering cheer

  united we gave one mighty cheer that
woke them up and when the blaze of
twenty-nine carbines jumped into their-
faces there was one of the greatest stam-
pedes ever seen

  the red-skins scattered to right and left
except fifteen or twenty who were lying
where we shot them before they could
rally we sent another shower of bullets into
them

  the answering cheer from the coach was
music to our ears we fought to get to it
but we seemed to have run into the whole
sioux nation we were soon fighting for
our lives and were as badly in need of
help as those in the coach

  with what little light there was from the
stars and camp-fires we saw groups of
indians every way we looked the rush
of the charge had scattered our party as
well as the indians yet we kept together
as best we could and pushed for the coach
it was like going against the tide they
were everywhere and they were not afraid
of us

  we kept firing as fast as we could but
it was difficult to make the shots tell for
the indians were closing around us-now
hiding behind their ponies now lying flat
on the ground-and over and around  us
from all sides the -sharp arrows now began
to whir

  we mustered eighteen of our number
put our horses on the dead run and made
a dash for the coach as we came on the
indians fronting us we blazed at them
with our carbines then whipped out our
six-shooters and opened on them

  this was more than they could stand
and we broke through but they closed in
behind us and pressed us so hard that
when we came to the coach we could not
stop but were compelled to pass right on

  i was so close to the coach that i could
see two of the men lying perfectly still
how the julesburg mail was lost

the broncos hitched to the coach were dead
in their harness

  right behind us came the indians a
hundred yards beyond the coach we turned
and tried to charge back it was no use
we could not do it besides our little
band was again broken up so we who
were left together dismounted and opened
a steady fire

  now eight good shots back to back are
dangerous and the savages held off we
did not waste a cartridge and whenever
we could see an indian plain enough for a
sure shot he died

  there were but eight of us in the squad
and i said to barney mccune who was
popping away on my right well old
man if all the men now missing are killed
the old company will be easy to account for
by daylight

  an arrow purred between us we both
let drive at the archer-and got him

  we had been at bay about five minutes
when the steady firing from our part of the
field attracted three more of our men they
came to us from the direction of the river
they reported that the indians seemed to
be drawing off-although they were thick
enough around us

  all at once pete smith shouted look
look boys what are they doing look
over there 

  it wasnt necessary to watch tetes hand
the light showed me where to look

  the indians had managed somehow to
set fire to the old coach

  as it flamed up we could see a white
man lying face down about six yards
from it

the thick of the fight

  now that the coach was in flames and
was within sure range of our carbines the
indians kept out of sight but how they
yelled we could see nothing of them
but on all sides from far and near the
very night seemed to be shrieking at us

  our party was too far back to be seen
but we soon had to get still farther back
for the fire was getting brighter all the
time

  all at once captain mix whispered
look at that man lying near the fire
do you see him move

  we had supposed him dead and a few
replied no captain he is dead

 but look  insisted the old man

     rr

watch his hands look quickly they
are moving 

  dropping flat on the ground i looked
at the mans hands i could see them
open and shut at one time i knew that
one hand made a distinct motion to us

  captain i said it is ned baker
and he is alive i not only see his hands
open and shut but i can see him motion-
ing to us with them and with his head
also

  are you sure asked captain mix

   yes captain i am sure i can see his
eyes roll as plainly almost as i see yours

in the jaws of death

  whats to be done muttered the cap-
tain  it is almost certain death to go
into the light there where he is and he is
nearly done for hut we cant leave him
there-

  captain mix i said let every man
get the magazine of his carbine filled and
one in the breech then let me make a
dash for baker he is one of my best and
oldest friends when i go let the boys
open on anything and everything in sight
that will give me a chance to get to him

  you are not going over there carney
you would not live to get half-way across
the bottom-

  baker moved again and the old man
said all right-try it

  i got ready bending low on my horse
i sent the spurs into him and it seemed as
if i were beside the wounded man in three
jumps i leaned down from my horse
thinking to half carry half drag him but
he was as lead

  the poor fellow was shot through the
groin and an arrow was sticking in his
side his head lay on the ground with one
side of his face pillowed on the buffalo
grass

  when my horse came thundering to his
side baker did not move but only looked
up in a tired way and smiled as if sleepy

  kill me billy shoot me and go--or
theyll get both of us alive he murmured
but i couldnt kill ned baker

  the burning coach was now the only
protection i had except the rifles of my
comrades who shot so fast and well that
the reds for the moment were held at bay
but whir-whir-whir came the arrows

  as i leaned from the saddle to get a
grip on the helpless man who kept on


the railroad mans magazine

begging me to kill him my good horse dan
began to quiver suddenly his hind-quar-
ters sank to the ground he tried to get
up but could not he kept his front feet
on the ground and held his noble head
high in the air as i stepped from the
saddle i saw that he was shot through the
spine

  poor old dan who had carried me so
many hundreds of miles was dying be-
fore my eyes

dan put out of misery

  just then brave joe bucholtz came to
my side his first act of mercy was to
put dan out of pain i could not do it

  then we picked up baker put him on
joes horse and i held him upright while
joe jumped on behind baker must have
fainted for he said nothing and hung quite
limp

  joe put both arms around him hugged
up close-then sinking both spurs into the
sides of his big charger took a bee-line for
the little reserve i gripped the saddle
and ran by his side i could run in those
days and could set a pretty hot pace for
any horse for the first hundred yards so
i had little trouble keeping up it was
lucky that i did so for baker began to
slide off on the side where i was running
and as joe could not pull him back alone
the horse shied to the left and we could
barely hold him on

  i had just strength enough left to lower
him to the ground the boys and the old
man gave us a silent cheer joe and i had
done our work in less than one hundred
seconds i can tell you that standingin
the open light between the fire of twenty-
seven hot carbines and a bunch of indians
off there in the dark who were trying to
dash in on you makes a man work fast

  the rest of the command whom we sup-
posed were killed had just joined the cap-
tains party this gave us all new cour-
age the old man had baker carried by
two men each mounted and by keeping
these two riders closed in by a set of fours
riding on each side of them it made it al-
most impossible for the wounded man to
slip to the ground

  quickly bakers escort moved toward
the river the rest of the company formed
a thin skirmish line to cover the retreat
and this line kept up such a target-finding
fire on the savages that it prevented them

from making any of their favorite rushes
-yet they pressed us like wolves

  when we came to the river baker was
laid under the bank safe for the time be-
ing from the fire of the indians

   the red-skins were intent on annihila-
ting us and it was the captains plan to
cross the river as soon as he was sure that
he had together all the men then alive

  with his permission i unsaddled one
of the pack-animals and was again mount-
ed though without a saddle ten of us
kept well out and kept firing at every
shadow in the dim light reflected from
the glowing coals of the coach i saw that
there was not an indian near it i could
see poor old dan where he fell from joes
bullet i whispered to the three men near-
est me and they agreed to go with me
and we four started through the dark at a
trot for the coach

  when about three hundred yards from
it we went at a dead run but as soon as
we got near my horse snorted shied and
refused to go a step closer to dan and the
dead broncos

rescuing the saddle

   i slid off and knife in hand crept over
to dan with three slashes i freed my
saddle from the body of my dead friend
i threw it over my shoulder and then i
stooped and gave my old c  pan ion a
good-by kiss and returned to my comrades

  one had caught and was leading my
mount toward me but all i could do just
then was to jump onto his bare back with
my saddle and ride break - neck for the
river

  it was high time we did ride for the
river for the indians had seen us and we
could hear the hoofs of their ponies as
they tried to cut us off but we got there
ahead of them and a singing shower of
bullets from our watching comrades threw
them back

  dawn was not an hour away indians
at the best are poor fighters in the dark
because of some foolish superstition they
dread to fight at night or during a thun-
der-storm- and this has saved many a
white mans life-but daybreak and twi-
light are their chosen times then it is
too dim to hit them at long range and
they can come tearing in to close quarters
where their arrows count for more than
bullets
how the julesburg mail was lost



  if there is any difference i should say
-from my experience-that they fight best
at the first peep of day-and that hour
was almost at hand all was now very
still

captain mix

  not a sound came from the dark pocket-
like place under the bluffs that skirt the
stage-road over there in that black gulf
we knew that hundreds perhaps thou-
sands of the red devils were waiting only
for the veil of night to lift that they may
rush us into the river and shoot us down
in the water

   as the platte was a swirling torrent then
and full of quicksands we could not hope
to cross it until there was at least a faint
sign of daylight

  there was nothing to do therefore but
wait it seemed like waiting to be exe-
cuted there was nothing to shoot at to
listen to or to look at yet we knew that
the indians were hatching something for
us while all we could do was to sit still
on our horses and wait

  they too knew that something was up
they were nervous restless ready to jump
at anything yet always eager to charge
and such uncertainty taxed a mans soul
more than the hottest fight

  however the old mans brain was
working-and we had learned to trust that
gray head no dashing prancing namby-
pamby overbearing strutter was brave old
captain mix - just a man through and
through a soldier to the core he would
have killed his best friend with his own
six-shooter for disobeying orders  ihe
battlefield and yet when there was not
grub enough for all he would go hungry
with his men he could quell a mutiny
alone and with bare hands when the
company mascot army jack a white bull-
dog died captain mix attended his fu-
neral once when they were about to cut
off both my feet because they were frozen
he hid me in his house and his noble wife
nursed me with her own hands in secret
for weeks until i recovered and they were
hunting me everywhere as a deserter

  he would have done as much too for
any man in that little troop silently wait-
ing there with him in the dark we trust-
ed him and jeft everything to him

  he knew just what to do twenty men
were formed into a line five paces apart
and sent out to carefully guard against a

surprise we walked our horses and each
man removed or made fast all trappings
that would make a noise several of the
men tore strips from their blankets or from
the lower part of their blouses and passed
them along to the others to tie between the
outside of the bit and the mouth of the
horse this did away with that jangling
noise made by the animals as they damped
their bifs when held in restraint

  twenty men even on horseback can
keep pretty quiet in such a place as we
neared the black pocket we halted lean-
ing forward on our horses we listened
all was still a little bird twittered in
fright as it flew away the grass rustled in
the breath of the morning breeze but there
was a something in the air-something
that seemed to buzz and whisper it
might have been my imagination but i
thought i could hear men talking in whis-
pers i knew that it would not be good
to hold the troop in that uncertain posi-
tion very long and was wondering what
the old man would do next when a single
horseman rode down our front

  i was startled was it an indian scout
the next moment i heard the voice of the
captain low and tense talking to us as lie
rode

   keep quiet men remain as you are
have every cartridge in that your guns
will hold if the attack is made before i
give you orders try and hold tliis line
when you hear the bugle sound die  rally
turn and make for the bank of the river-
then turn deliver your fire and try to
cross

   there are now twenty-one of us in
this line we can send a hundred and
seventy bullets into them in twenty sec-
onds that will stop them and give you
plenty of time to get to the river reserve
your six - shooters to use in the water
now remember your own lives and the
success of this nights work depends on
your holding this line old m troop has
never been wiped out and wont be this
time

old m troop was game

   each one of you can whip twenty in-
dians and we twenty-one together are
good for a whole regiment of them there
are three badly wounded comrades down
at the river we are now trying to get
them over hold this line and we are all
right-


the railroad mans magazine

  thus our captain talked to us as we
slowly rode along but he knew and we
knew that say what he might an ava-
lanche of indians threatened to sweep us
into the river at any instant-but we in-
tended to hold that line

  we had the spencer carbine at that
time the best weapon on the plains be-
sides each man had two big six-shooters
this gave every man twenty shots in
twenty seconds - and such a fire from
twenty-one men if well pointed will double
up a pretty large body of indians

  we waited every minute seemed an
hour the watch in my pocket made an
awful racket our breathing came long
and deep we knew that out there in the
darkness an army of red-skins was wait-
ing and we also knew that the first streak
of lischt over there behind the hills meant
an attack

  i was on the extreme left of the line
we were formed in a half-circle the
captain sat like an iron statue right in my
front an orderly came silently from the
river behind us and in a low whisper re-
ported that the party there was all ready
to attempt to cross the river with the
wounded

  hows baker breathed the captain

   dead sir replied the orderly

  tell them to strap the body to one of
the pack-saddles and start at once

  as the orderly rode back the captain
turned to me and murmured ned baker
was one of the whitest men i ever knew-

  hark i interrupted listen cap-
tain did you hear a bugle

   no he breathed

  with open lips and halted breath we
listened and heard the clear notes of a-
bugle again we heard it-oh so far
away	

a bugle-call

  we could hear only a note now and then
as it traveled up the valley the water help-
ing to conduct the sound but the next mo-
ment the bugler must have come around
a bend for the notes broke on us clear
and ringing as the bells of heaven

  then although miles away we plainly-
heard the rally-call the indians heard
it too help was coming-but so was the
dawn

  my god exclaimed the captain
that must be the lieutenant with the rest
of the men that bugler is moving he

is blowing the rally because it is a good
call to make a noise listen there it is
again he is now blowing all the calls-
retreat stable-call anything to attract our
attention

   dawson who is that blowing those
calls can you tell

    fairchild sir i am sure eagerly an-
swered bugler dawson who was next in
line

  the captain turned to me and said
have you a good horse

  i dont know captain i replied
 lies a strange one to me-one of the pack-
animals

  here dismount he said to dawson
jump on that horse corporal and ride
for your life-and for the lives of those
men remember if you dont get to the
lieutenant and stop him before he gets to
the big sandy cut the whole sioux tribe
will kill them as they turn the bend 

  i jumped on the buglers horse

  ride added the captain kill the
horse if you must but get to the men be-
fore they get to the cut keep well to the
west of the road to avoid the deep sand
and the indians-

  on a still night a running horse can be
heard a long way but just then the valley
was full of running horses for the in-
dians were moving and no doubt took me
to be one of their own kind i bent low
on his neck and sent him across the road
at a keen run as i circled well out from
the dangerous path i drew up a little to
listen

running the gauntlet

   it was well i did for i could distinctly
hear the jabber of the savages as they were
forming to surprise the other half of the
company when they turned the bend

  on each side of the road a large party
of indians were bunched silently waiting
to perform their part of the program i
was in a tight fix i must either ride
through the opening made by the two
groups of indians right along the road
through the very middle of the ambush
awaiting the coming lieutenant or else
ride around them

  my time was too short to ride around
i could hear the loud laugh of some troop-
er and heard distinctly the command
 less noise back there  given by the
lieutenant himself

  all at once it became very dark and on
how the julesburg mail was lost



the impulse of the moment i slid from my
horse turned him toward the captains
command and gave him a sharp jab with
my carbine i then bent over and ran
straight down the valley between those two
groups of indians fortunately they had
not yet heard or seen me so i kept as
close to the stage-road as possible

  i came to the bend and there was no
one in sight it must be that i had not
been seen for lurking in the dark on either
hand were two clouds of indians i could
not see them-it was still too dark but i
could hear them near they were proba-
bly a hundred yards away as i hot-foot-
ed it through the cut i could hear ahead
the clatter that is peculiar to a moving
squad of cavalry

along the river-bank

  in another moment i met two men riding
in advance and in a loud whisper chal-
lenged them to halt before they could
answer me i shouted in a loud whisper
dont come any closer they under-
stood i jumped up behind one of them
and we rode back to meet the lieutenant

  i told my story as quickly as i could
and suggested that we ride down to the
river and then try -to join captain mix by
moving up along the bank

  this plan worked all right the lieu-
tenants command was soon at the river
then we began to deploy into a skirmish
line to find captain mix before we came
within hailing distance we heard firing
it soon developed into the heavy solid re-
ports of the big-caliber guns

  there was no doubt now but that the
indians had discovered that their trick had
failed and in their chagrin had viciously
attacked the captains party it was all
too evident that the indians were trying
to clean them out before we could help
them then the red fiends would swing
back on us and by sunup the hair of the
whole command would be sioux property

  concealment was now off he lieu-
tenant gave the command to gallop and

we tore into that band of indians like a
snow-plow

  fairchilds bugle answered dawsons
and cheer met cheer as the two commands
swept together and became one under the
orders of the old man m troop was it-
self again

  the old man was happy and the lieu-
tenant tickled the troopers yelled like
schoolboys and made their sixty-two spen-
cer carbines talk turkey

   it did not take us long to clean the bot-
tom land of indians but day was now
breaking and on the top of the high bluffs
against the sky we could see hundreds of
them too far away to fire at

  by the time it was good daylight we
were crossing the platte while the indians
began to show up in large numbers along
the bluffs as the day increased they
rode down to the stage-line but they could
w hurt us for had they attempted to
cross the river we would have killed hun-
dreds of them while they were in the water
as we filed away for home the indians
left us and we saw no more of them

   at the first halt we left poor ned baker
in- a shallow grave that we dug with our
knives

   all day we followed the river until op-
posite the fort we crossed just at dusk
and were soon asleep in the barracks miss
evans was heartbroken at the fate of the
coach and we were all thankful that she
had been saved

   two weeks after the night fight i went
as one of ten of our company to moores
ranch to escort the down coach with pay-
master bates as a passenger having
plenty of time we exhumed bakers body
and buried him just behind antelope sta-
tion not more than forty yards from the
old stage-road he had traveled so many
times

  we got an unplaned board lettered it
with black axle-grease from the hub of a
government wagon and stuck it in the
ground at the head of the grave there
lie sleeps as brave and gentle a man as
ever lived

                                                                f-

      something more than the peace that passeth all
      understanding came from the light that failed

stsssjk illy ran up to my room his face
           like the snow that was driving
           against the pane outside he

  itajfj threw himself into a chair and
sat there clasping and un-
clasping his hands and biting
his lips to keep them from trembling

  whats the matter i asks thinking
he and kitty had had another of their spats
they were having them so often that i had
kind of got used to them but billy would
always get worked up to about the way he
was now he hadnt sense enough to keep
cool he didnt know that when a man keeps
cool lies got it all over a woman with a
serpents tongue

   shes gone he says with a moan

  i was pulling on my shoes for id been
called for a fifty-eight and i hadnt much
time i stopped with a shoe half  and
looked at him

   gone   i says

  yes kitty shes run away

  if that was true billys moaning and
shaking was justified all right if kitty
had run away from him if she meant to
stay away from him she had broken his
heart thats all there was to it because
no man ever cared more for a wisp of a
black-haired blue-eyed little irish maid
than billy cared for kitty

  she had been the operator over at arden
junction and he had fallen at her feet as
you might say the minute lie had seen her
from the engine-cab while the engineer
had been inside getting his orders

  billy was firing the local and one day
they had to pick up a bunch of cars at the
junction they was hard to get at and by
the time they was coupled onto the train
the local had to get in for a through freight
billy always did have nerve and it didnt
take him long to get chinning with kitty

  she blushed and smiled and made eyes
at him and he never dreamed that one so
pretty had such a terrible temper

  so soon as they was married - which
wasnt long after this-she began to com-
plain i dont mean that she began to
whimper it wasnt that kind of complain-
ing she was too healthy and strong a
little minx for that but she was forever
objecting to what billy did if he bought
a new necktie shed look at it when he put
it on and then shed say

   for goodness sake why dont you get
some color besides blue you know you
always look a fright in blue things

  likewise she objected to his shoes and
his hats and his suits if she sent him to
the grocery-store or the meat-market she
always asked him why he didnt buy just
the opposite to what she had particularly in-
structed him to buy

  i was rooming with them at the time and
billy used to tell his troubles to me he
had to tell them to somebody or hed gone
nutty i never said a word outside the
house but pretty soon there began to be
gossip

  some of the women in the village kept
fooling around with the story till they had
billy beating his wife people began to
look at him kind of funny once in a while
when hed get into a wrangle with one of
the boys theyd taunt him by saying
 why dont you  

  billys face would turn pale at that and
hed never have a word to say gradually
he got nervous and half sick

  then about a week before this particular
night he went to kitty after supper and
tried to make peace with her i was up-
stairs but i couldnt help hear what they
said

  for goodness sake kitty lets try to
swinging down the 



get along somehow without quarreling
billy pleads

   i could just imagine how kitty looked up
at him from her sewing

   who in the world is doing any quar-
reling she says im sure i havent
opened my lips to-night

   we dont get along right together
says billy and i suppose he was clasping
and unclasping his hands nervously

    what do you want to do - get a di-
vorce   asks kitty

   i heard billy jump up

	get adivorce he said so loud you
might have heard him on the street you
know i cant live without you

   keep still then or youll have to live
without me says kitty and her voice was
like icicles

   way up-stairs i could hear billy grind
his teeth

   i wont keep still he shouted his
nerves probably being all tied up in a knot
by this time this is my house and 
talk all i like 

   kitty laughed a little longer and a little
louder than youd thought was necessary or
natural then it was all still down-stairs

i guess they didnt speak in the week that
followed and now here was billy moaning
and carrying on about her because she had
gone i tried to brace him up

   did she leave any word i asked

   he fished out a scrap of paper like the
wronged guy in the show does

   she just says shes going he
 and for me not to follow her be-
cause it wont do me no good

    aw i says  shes probably try-
ing to make you sore shes probably
gone over to the junction to her
mothers

  whats the odds asks billy she
says she wont see me any more-that it
wont do me no good to follow her it dont
make no difference if shes over at the junc-
tion or in africa or next door shes got
her mind made up-thats all

   knowing kittys temper i was afraid
maybe he was right he got up after a while
and dragged himself down-stairs when i
came down in the morning he was sitting
at the dining-room table his hands in his
pockets staring straight ahead of him at
the carpet i asked him if he were going
out on his run he wanted to know what
time it was and i told him he had an hour
he jammed his hat on his head and started

out as he went down the sidewalk he
kind of staggered like a man whod been
drinking but he didnt drink i guass he
was just hurt as if hed got a swift smash
in the nose thatd dazed him some

   im not strong on butting into the troubles
of other folks usually ive got enough of
my own but i got after a bit sot couldnt

said

to

billy always did have nerve

stand the look that was slowly becoming
fixed in billys eyes i know that lots and
lots of times he looked at men and things
and never saw them

  when he heard what you said to him-
which was not very often-he would an-
swer by a nocl or by yes or no he
didnt eat enough to keep a canary - bird


the railroad mans magazine

from starving to death he told me to go
ahead and help myself to whatever i want-
ed in the house and i used to cook my
own breakfast over kittys stove w hen id
ask billy to eat hed wheel around in his
chair take a look at the food taste it maybe
and shove his plate away

   i cant eat he said one morning  i
cant do anything he dropped his head
into his hands  ill never be any good
till she comes back he moaned

  then he got up and went to work with that
same dazed look in his face id been think-
ing that probably kitty was as anxious to
see him by now as he was to see her and i
made up my mind to go over to the junction
to find out if she was there

  i sure had cold feet when billy mckenna
slowed up a fifty-eight and let me drop

okce she vajted five hours for billys engine

off there the next day i found out where
her mother lived and really shoved myself
up to the front door by the nape of the neck

  i supposed the old lady who opened the
door was her mother yes she said kitty
was there but she didnt know as kitty
would see me shed ask

  i sat in the parlor pretty soon kitty
comes tripping in as gay as you please

  she was just like some good-looking
school kid then she had her black hair
down her back in two braids and her blue
eyes were dancing she grabbed hold of
my hands and shook them to beat the band
as if i was her best friend then she
started a string of conversation that on
the level lasted for thirty minutes and
never a mention of poor old billy in the
whole of it she made me sore

   if youre through with the gabble now
i says when she had finished well talk
a little sense

  aw i knew that it was all put on the
brightness died out of her like youd snap
a gas-jet shut her face looked old i
noticed there were lines under her eyes
well what is it she asked

  whatre you doing this to billy for
i asks

  her face turned red

   i dont know as its any of your busi-
ness tom mitchell she says  if i want
to leave him ill leave him he said it
was his house now hes got it all to him-
self and he can talk himself to death for
all of me i suppose he thinks hes a big
man now hes got an engine

    got an engine  i repeated

	 oh mr innocence she said with a
kind of laugh you know theyve given
him an engine he goes out on his first
run next week

   i didnt care to contradict her it didnt
make any difference but to think that
billy had an engine after his long wait and
that he had been so wrapped up in his grief
that he didnt think it worth while to tell
me

  why many and many a time when he
was first married he used to look at the
big moguls kind of wistfully and say to
me i hope ill be getting one of those old
boys before long for her sake

  now hed got one but instead of coming
home to her with pride in his eyes and tell-
ing her hed hadnt given it two thoughts
and she had learned about it at second
hand
swinging down the 



   i got up and left it was a little too much
for me

  it certainly did seem as if that winter
was to be the winter of the big snows
the plows were out every day from early
december till the march rains
came and cold whee

  one sunday afternoon it began
to blow a little an hour later a
few flakes were whirling down in
the next hour the snow thickened
and when darkness fell the air was
choked you couldnt see your
hand before your face

  i thanked my lucky stars that i
had just come in and probably
wouldnt be called till morning

billy had got in before daylight
and as he expected he was called
for a forty-nine-a fast freight
west bound-about dusk

  this was his third run with his
engine he didnt seem to be in-
terested in the new job particularly
nor did he seem to care that he had
to go out in the worst night we had
had that winter he accepted it all
as calmly as the oldest veteran on the road

  theyll run you pretty light i said
by way of sympathy they likely wont
be giving you more than fifteen loads in
this storm

   oh i dont care says billy  i can
take em through i guess if i cant i can
get stuck in a drift

   as i have said kitty had been the opera-
tor at arden junction my guess that she
was lonesome for billy proved right for
she used to go down to the office where she
had worked and watch the trains go by

  the regular operator told me that once
she waited five hours for billys engine to
come over from the other terminal when
it went by she stood looking through a
crack in the door till the train was out of
sight

  the operator said too that she ran out
the door and home without a word then
im making a bet that there were nights
when the poor kid cried herself to sleep
but she had an irish pride and you cant
beat that

  this night i figure she had a nervous
streak when youve worked on a railroad
a storm doesnt help that kind of a streak
so about the time the snow was thickening
she wraps herself up and goes down to the
office

  it happened that the operator had left for
supper he went about dusk and he hadnt
put up his block light-we were then using
the old-fashioned block that had a light set
on a peg on top of it which the operator

desk she cut in the train wire and for the
fun of it began copying orders on a pad of
paper with a pen pretty soon she hears an
order sent to forty-nine and to a fifty-eight

  she told me she got a funny little shock
when the forty-nine was reported out and
she heard billys name go over the wire
she sat there curled up in the big arm chair
waiting till the forty-nine should come by
she said she was worried about billy being
out in a storm like that some of the old
love was left in her heart

  there isnt any feeling like that which
suddenly comes when you realize that two
trains are bearing down on each other with
neither knowing that they havent got the
right of way

  even if you are not at fault and the
people in danger are only acquaintances
you get an awful tight feeling around your
heart

  what dye suppose kitty felt when the
operator at wallace the station beyond
arden junction reported the fifty-eight by

  kitty had copied the order to the forty-
nine and the fiftv-eiaht and she knew thev


the railroad mans magazine

were to meet at wallace and the fifty-eiglit
was to take the siding so that the forty-
nine with its fast freight could go by
without delay

  i guess it would have done billy good to
have seen the look in her eyes then

  she told me that she sat half paralyzed
-taring at the sounder for a full minute
then she dropped the block and ran out to
look at it but of course there was no light

  she ran inside she was nearly crazy
the storm was at its height the wind
was steady from the northwest and every
inch of it was packed with snow

  kitty lit a red lantern and ran outside
once more she couldnt see a thing but
she located the track with her feet and in
that awful storm with the wind whipping
her hair free and the icy snow biting her
face she stumbled along over the half-
hidden ties

  she figured afterwards that she ran about
a third of a mile then she heard the
hoarse whistle of billys engine out of the
dark

  she stood still and looked but she
couldnt make out a thing then she heard
the  champ-champ  of the train as it went
over a frozen frog

  it was so close she almost dropped her
lantern but when she remembered she lift-
ed it high and began to wave it trying to
swing billy down

  she might as well have waved a match to
an air-ship six thousand feet up in the
blue

  as it was the engine almost got her
billy could not see her lantern and she
couldnt see the headlight of the engine
because of the snow

  she jumped just as the big black shape
was almost on her and fell into a drift
all she could see as she gathered herself
up was other dark shapes going by in the
driving snow

  she stumbled up screamed and waved
her lantern but the wind drowned her voice
and then suddenly flicked out the light

  as the caboose slipped past her she stood
there crying and yelling and waving a lan-
tern which had no light

  she began to cry i he tears ran down
her cheek- and froze then she quieted
herself and listened her sobs came every
once in a while and she caught big mouth-
fuls of cold air

  a scream from billys whistle tore a hole
in the storm he had seen she waited for

another noise that she also knew was com-
ing it seemed a long time although it
was probably about half a minute

  the engines were almost on top of each
other before billy saw the fifty-eight

  that other noise that came to kittys ears
was a sudden crash and then the ring of
metal snapping and tearing in the cold

  they had come together at thirty miles
an hour kitty knew that billv had not
had time to jump

  in such moments the little things in life
just seem to lose themselves kitty said that
she only wanted to get to billy

  in some way she made that third of a mile
back to the wreck two engines were locked
together just this side of the telegraph office
those of the crew who hadnt been hurt were
working at the engines trying to get to the
engineers and the firemen

  there wasnt any hurry about the engi-
neer of the fifty-eight waiting wouldnt
do him any harm he had paid for for-
getting his wallace order or losing himself
in the storm or whatever mistake he had
made the two firemen were jarred and
bruised but not badly hurt

  while kitty stood there biting her lips
and trying to keep from interfering witli the
men in their work they took billy uncon-
scious from between the tender and the cab

  poor little kitty she was pretty game
to follow them into the telegraph office with-
out speaking a word when she didnt know
whether he was dead or living they laid
him down on a bench and while one of them
ran for a doctor others tied a big handker-
chief around one of his legs and covered it
with an overcoat

  that was all kitty could stand she put
them aside and knelt beside billy

  im his wife she says - and she
meant it

  she called for water and she bathed
billys forehead till the doctor came he
looked billy over pretty fast

  what is it kitty asks

  just then billy opened his eyes

   why says the doctor coldly  hes
pretty badly hurt cant tell much just
now hell lose a foot anyhow

  as the doctor goes to the phone to call
a buggy to get billy to a hospital billy
lets out a long low moan kitty puts her
arms around him like he was a sick kid
and she was his mother he opens his eyes
again and looks at her cold pale face with
the tears frozen on it
swinging down the 	

  i tried to swing you down billy she
 says

 right there his first thought seemed to be
 of her

  was you out in that storm   he asks

  ill never leave you again billy she
says

  but im worse than i was before he
says  and i was a pretty bum husband
then he said id lose my foot

they

 i tried to swing you down she says
 again

 his hand kind of gropes along till it
 touches hers

  are you all right   he asks

 yes she says never mind me
 does it hurt billy 

  it hurts he says  could you stick by
 me a little while 

   i can work she says  i used to
think what you did was your fault that
was the reason i scolded you but this
wasnt your fault ill never leave you
again

  and she never did they began life
anew and heaven sent them a little angel
to bind their contentment they are happy
now

increased operating gost

the cost of many important articles of supply
used by the railways has increased more
than  per cent fuel for locomotives consti-
tutes about  per cent of the cost of operation

  owing to the increased price of coal during the
last ten years which in some states has amount-
ed to as much as  per cent it is asserted that for

si	spent for locomotive fuel in  for each
 of gross receipts the ratio has declined in
 to  for each  of gross receipts

  the expense of taxation is shown to have in-

creased from  a mile of line in  to
 a mile of line in  over  per cent
the cost of regulations both state and national
which is classified akin to taxation has also add-
ed greatly to the expense of the carriers

  a conservative computation discloses that the
costs due to increases in expenses or reductions in
revenue imposed by statutes or by commissions
acting under federal and state regulatory laws
cost the railways of the united states

a  near order

the following near order of the railroad
commission of arkansas indicates the im-
pressions of the efficient secretary of that body re-
garding the recent inspection of the tyronza cen-
tral railroad a tap-line some fourteen miles in
length it proves that the author has a keen sense
of humor

some twenty years ago e o davis now a
passenger conductor on the frisco was a
local freight brakeman mr davis always pos-
sessed a well-developed vein of humor

  his train had taken a siding and his restless
spirit took him to the front end on a tour of in-
spection he found a warm oil-box on the en-
uine-tank while fit was not his duty to doctor
defects on the engine or tank he realized that all
the box needed was a little oil

  accordingly he asked the engineer for an oil-
tan thinking he was doing him a favor the engi-
neer was grouchy and thinking the hot box was
on a car said

   aint got no oil for brakemen if you cant
run her set her out

  davis said nothing and did less at the next
top twelve miles away llie box was blazing the
journal was cherry red and the brass broken a
new brass was absolutely necessary to avoid cutting
the journal the engineer and fireman proceeded
with the work of jacking up the box extracting
the broken pieces of brass and cooling tin journal
after placing the new brass in place they looked
about for packing there was none on the engine

hope behind and proceed to inspect the two

the limit

the long freight had left grand junction
on nearing the first water-tank the fireman
asked the brakeman to take water for him as he
wanted to clean the ash-pans when the engine
came to a stop the fireman took the slide hook and
jumped to the ground he pulled the slides out
but as nothing in the way of ashes fell out he put
the hook through the air-holes to poke them out
suddenly he prodded something soft so he lit his
torch and investigated

in the pan he saw a tramp curled up taking
things easy the fireman started to  bail the bo

 well of all the nerve-you are the limit
what are you doing in there get out beat

the bo simply put his finger up to his lips and
said

boonton new jersey but made a mistake and
boarded a train for montclair new jersey the
conductor on collecting the tickets explained the
mistake and told them to get off at the next sta-
tion and wait for the boonton train

thinking that the next train that came along
was the one they wanted they boarded it and
were again told that they were on the wrong train
and were forced to get out at the next station and
wait for the boonton train

by this time the men were quite worked up
over their experience and were using some pretty
bad language when they entered the next train
which was bound for boonton a clergyman who
was sitting in the seat in front of them heard the

something did happen

a witness in a railroad case at fort worth
kansas was asked to tell in his own way
how the accident happened he said

murphy thought he had the best job in the world

 one night no  was late and murphy was anx-
 ious to get home to his supper

   just after dark the train was heard in the dis-
 tance she came along as if the engineer intended
 to make up the lost time even if he did fracture
 the speed ordinance as the headlight showed up
 around the curve murphy got out his red lantern
 and swung it frantically	

   the engineer applied the brakes the sparks hew
 from the wheels and the train came to a stop
 shortly after the engine passed murphy the en-
 gineer ran back to see why he was stopped and
 before he had time to ask the question murphy
 began

philip has an encounter in the night

then tries to prove his innocence

synopsis of previous chapters

among the mountains of southern california lived old eugene caillo gold-miner and miser to
him had recently come his dead sisters child beautiful eighteen-year-old carmita in the
course of events philip garrick master of the rancho buena vista visits the store kept by
caillo and meets carmita who is much sought by all the men of the neighborhood among them being
jim gormley superintendent of the comet mine a villainous sort of fellow whose desire is to get at
caillos riches through carmita she repulses him after ptillip has declared his love shortly after
caillos body is discovered at the bottom of a sluice and suspicion instigated by gormley falls upon
carmita and philip gormley leaves town but is quickly followed by philip who has evidence that the
former has committed the murder he finally traces gormley to carnullo city where he has been
stricken with smallpox and there on his dying bed signs a confession of his guilt

chapter ix
the enemy in ambush

f all the beautiful towns in
southern california that were
baptized by the original
spanish settlers rosalia was
the mostbeautiful situated
at the base of mount kaweah
whose snow-capped peak acted as a guide
and sentinel through summer and winter it
was even more than home to the men and
women who were so fortunate as to live
there

  its ever-green spanish customs the charm-
ing patois of its people the eternal summer-
time the birds the flowers the beautiful
women the languorous southern nature that
seemed to permeate everything-all formed
a fascinating abiding-place-and such a
place can only be found in southern cali-
fornia

  so there was little reason when philip
garrick returned to the rancho buena vis-
ta-to the girl he so dearly loved and for
whom he had hunted down the unfortunate
gormley-that either he or carmita should
want to leave for what was known only to

the people of southern california as the
northland

   but the viper of abuse seemed to point in
but one direction for the lovers

  a few days after philip reached home
an ugly rumor was set afloat that gormley
had not died as philip had described the
distance from rosalia to carnullo was too
far to warrant the sending of a disinterested
party to verify the graphic story that philip
told of the manner in which gormley signed
the confession

  even if such a course had been possible
the expense was a matter of deep considera-
tion and in the ethics of the southland
philips money would have been refused in
payment for such an undertaking

  in the midst of these rumors-rumors that
bred the foul assertion that philip and car-
mita were cognizant of old caillos death
and that it was obviously necessary for them
to get gormley out of the way-philip and
carmita strove for recognition

   butonce started the flame of public opin-
ion is a desperate thing to check and before
philip knew the very men whom he had
called his closest friends were either begin-
ning to regard him with suspicion or had
turned from him altogether

began in the november railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

  true the lovers had some stanch friends
but now they were so terribly in the minority
that when the terrible debates that startled
the town were at fever-heat these friends
were snowed under by the volume of oppo-
site opinion

  burning with indignation carmita and
philip feared that they had only one choice
that was to let padre gregorio of the mis-
sion marry them then they would start
for the north

  but what would i do in that cold far-
away country philip  

  carmita twined her arms around the neck
of her lover as she spoke

   i would take care of you dearest you
would never suffer here we must live as
the victims of mockery and abuse you
could not stand it the roses would go from
your cheeks the sunlight would go from
your eyes in the new country we will have
all the happiness in the world and i will
work to show these people how impossibly
they judge us

  do you surely think it is for the best
philip 

   surely

  then will i do as you bid philip you
are all i have in this world you are more
to me now than any other thing-living or
inanimate if anything should happen to
you  would kill myself without the slight-
est hesitancy

  a gentle smile played over carmitas face
as she spoke these last words it gave the
keenest emphasis to her threat

  she meant it-even- word

  he put his arm around her shoulders and
drew her toward him and kissed her that
was just what he would have her do young
and strong and healthy as he was he did
not want to think that she would live if
death were to call him away

  my brave wonderful love he softly-
said

  my own philip she whispered as she
returned his caress

  they walked down the path of the old
dobe garden at the garden they said good
night athousand times-it seemed it was
an hour for a lingering with no noise save
the hum of the night things and no light
save that shed by the stars they parted as
if chains had to be severed

  you will come to-morrow philip-very
early

  very early dearest very early and
to-night i will -top in at the mission iadre

gregorio who believes me and trusts you
will be awake i shall tell him that we will
be in the little chapel at sunrise and he
will tie the knot that will make you mine
in the eyes of the law then dearest with
law and love to bind us we can never never
be separated goodnight

  he drew away from her and started down
the winding road that led in the direction
of the mission

  perhaps after all it were best to take
this step though carmita loved her birth-
place as only a southerner can she would
soon get accustomed to northern ways and
her beauty with his wealth and ambition
would give them position and prestige wher-
ever they might choose to live

  the glow of future happiness filled his
breast as he moved along the road indeed
the change was welcome he began to plan
a myriad pleasant things for the future
when the lights of the mission gleamed a
silent welcome in the night about half a
mile ahead

  though there was no sound to indicate
the presence of others he was suddenly con-
scious that some one was following him

  there are vibrations that travel from one
being to another if the mind of one is on
the other it is a vague and mystic wonder
but so sure as death it is true philips
mind suddenly diverted from the thoughts
of his and carmitas future happiness in
an instant he was conscious that there were
one or more human beings behind him

  he turned suddenly but saw no one

  standing stock-still in the middle of the
road his heart beating violently he took
his revolver from his hip-pocket and placed
it in the bosom of his shirt

  there was no sound perhaps he was
mistaken

  he turned in the direction of the mission
and hastened his footsteps before he had
gone fifty feet he was again conscious of the
thing or being that ghostlike was trailing
in his footsteps

  philip was a brave man but there were
highwaymen in the southland and he would
take no chances

  with lightning-like agility he drew his
pistol from his shirt and turned

  a figure darted into the chaparral to his
left he judged that it must have been at
least a hundred feet from where he stood

  he could not tell whether it was a man
or an animal

   ill find out just who you are he said
in the hornets nest



as he started down the road in the direction
of the vanished figure

  he cocked his gun and held it over his
left forearm

  with the steady step of one who knows
no danger philip reached the clump of
bushes behind which the figure had disap-
peared

  he halted by the roadside straining his
ears for anything that seemed like a sound

  in the chaparral all was darkness he
could see nothing and even though he
strained his eyes for the faintest sound
there was nothing-nothing save the plain-
tive chirp of a cricket

  philip stood stock still waiting for the
sound that must inevitably come if there
were any living thing hiding within the
range of his hearing

   whoever it is or whatever it is he said
it can keep positively still only just so long
it must move sooner or later

  then the underbrush rustled

  not ten feet from where he stood there
was the unmistakable sound of something
moving in the leaves

  whos that come out shouted
philip

   he spoke with the full force of his voice
then he let the trigger of his revolver down
gently under the pressure of his thumb and
cocked it sharply the sharpness of his
voice and the sharp cocking of the revolver
would tell the man hiding in the chaparral
-if it were a man - that philip was not
afraid and that he was armed

  the rustling stopped

  come out of that philip shouted
again

   his words were followed by a faint noise
then a twig snapped sharply then the
heavy crunch of a booted foot

   philip fired in the bushes at his feet and
stepped back into the middle of the road

  come out he shouted again i am
going to shoot 

  the command was heeded

  a man stepped out from behind the chap-
arral he was bending over and he car-
ried a knife

  up said philip leveling at him

  the man did not seem to pay any heed
philip again ordered him to put up his
hands

  not so quick mr garrick

  the voice came from behind philip

  he half turned a second man was ap-
proaching

   r r

  this man was armed with a revolver
not so fast mr garrick the second
man said with a slow drawl and dont be
so handy with that gun

  who are you asked philip

  just who i am is none of your business
-at least not at present he replied
what do you want asked philip

   as the man drew closer philip recognized
sth waters a former deputy sheriff whom
the governor had been forced to remove
from office because he could not quite ex-
plain his connection with a certain hold-up

  as philip recognized the man he drew
back and said

   i know you now-seth waters -what
do you want

    i want to talk to you and i want to do
it peaceful-like

   go ahead said philip

  me and my pal said waters has
come to you representing the citizens of
rosalia

  at this juncture the pal drew up he
had straightened up and his knife was
sheathed

  you represent the citizens of rosalia
said philip and for what pray

  did you call on that woman carmita
to-night asked seth waters

    thats none of your business answered
philip dont mention her name again
 it is my business and if you say you
didnt you lie 

   what if i did   asked philip the
blood was rising in his temples he would
stand but very little of this sort of talk

    the citizens demand that you leave this
county before dawn said seth

  and if i refuse said philip

   then me and dick bender here lias been
voted a committee to see that you do
philips next impulse was to open fire on
the two men he would have gladly taken
a chance and he was sure that he could
have laid both in the dust but with the
pulse of the community at fever heat and
with the clamor that was being hurled against
him and carmita this plan would have been
most impractical

  how would he account for the dead bod-
ies would the authorities believe him
would an enraged populace rise up against
him and hang him to the nearest tree

  silence held the three men for a moment
then philip spoke

   you and dick bender are a fine pair to
represent the people of rosalia-


the railroad maxs magazine

   i want no comment mr garrick ben-
der and me has a duty to perform and we
dont need to take any guff from you

   i dont care to waste any words with
either of you answered philip what is
your plan  

   we go down the road to rosalia town
said seth waters  in the stables of pete
williams there is three saddled horses we
rides with you out of rosalia down to the
county line two miles this side of caliente-
and then we says good-by

    that sounds pleasant answered philip
and now i asks you seth drawled on
 do we go in peace  

  philip thought for a moment

  what do you mean by that he asked
i mean said seth are you willin to
go along quietly with us and put up your
gun

   that suits me philip answered

  the ex-deputy and philip slipped their
guns in their hip pockets simultaneously
bender ran his knife into the little pocket in
his right boot which he had made for the
purpose

        chapter x
        over the hedge

the three men started down the road
- philip walked in the middle and
seth and bender on either side in the ruts
made by wagon wheels

   the little light in the old mission shone
brightly through the cluster of rose-vines
and orange-branches that grew in profusion
around its historic walls

   philip started at a pretty fast clip seth
and his pal kept up without an extra breath
for the first few hundred feet none of the
three uttered a word finally philip broke
the monotony of their steps and the silence
of the night by saying to seth waters as
kindly as possible

    seth tell me just what prompted the citi-
zens of rosalia to take this action

   waters seemed glad that philip had adopt-
ed a pleasant attitude and he replied with
equal solicitude

  well garrick the people hereabouts
dont quite like the storv that you been
tellin about the death of old caillo an
that there confession of jim gormleys it
looks like you aint on the level and that you
have something that you want to hide
philip laughed in a half-hearted way

    i am sorry that they feel that way seth
but the time will come when they will un-
derstand that i am telling the truth i will
make that the one object of my life

  seth waters did not reply he did not
seem to care to converse further on the point
that interested philip the most and he began
to whistle some little melody that fitted in
time with the measured tread of his foot-
steps

  they were now almost opposite the gar-
dens redolent with the wealth of odorous
blossoming plants that surrounded the old
catholic mission

  the lamp at the outer gate burned as a
welcome to all who needed shelter in the
night or to tell the passing that they might
come in and pray on the marble paths that
led to the cloisters

   in the darkness neither seth nor bender
could see that philip was observing the place
closely

  he was mentally measuring certain dis-
tances-trying to ascertain which was the
object and which the shadow the stars
shine with wonderful brightness down in the
kaweah country and illumine with a pecu-
liar distinctness if the night is clear philip
was accustomed to this light in idle mo-
ments sitting alone on the porch of his home
on the rancho buena vista he had often
studied the wonderful glory of this marvel
of all lights-so soft so silvery and so clear
an old mexican once told him how difficult
it was to discern the real from the shadow
in this mystic light-and he thought that he
would put it to the test

  before the men who were acting as his
escort were aware philip stepped behind
with the agility of a cat he dashed to the
side of the road and leaped over the hedge
that surrounded the mission

   in an instant seth waters drew his re-
volver and fired

   the shot pierced the hedge close to philip

   down on all-fours crouching close to the
hedge he started in the direction of the
mission buildings

   once he found it necessary to get on his
feet to dash across an open stretch

   fear had no terror for him he made the
dash seth waterss pistol again flashed
on the night he heard the bullets thud
as it struck the earth not far from him

   seth was aiming at his shadow

  in a moment the mission was awake a
robed form came running toward philip
the ranchman recognized his friend
in the hornets nest



  padre gregorio padre gregorio  he
called as he ran toward the priest

  waters and bender were close after phil-
ip the ranchman reached the priest who
caught him in his arms

  philip garrick what means this
asked the priest

   padre these men-

  waters and bender had come up waters
had his pistol drawn ready to shoot

    stop  cried the father raising his hand
 how dare you raise a hand to kill on the
premises of the church  

  this man is our prisoner padre said
waters  he is trying to escape

   that is not so replied philip hotly
 they followed me down the road and held
me up like common thieves

   he must come with us said waters
let me stay here till morning padre
i will tell you all you believe me i
know

   i believe you above every other man i
know replied the good man

  thank you padre

   i protest  shouted waters  you are
interfering with the law

   i beg that you remember to whom you
are talking said padre gregorio  and i
ask you to leave this place at once ask
yourselves who established the law here

    i am responsible to the citizens of ro-
salia for this man persisted seth waters

   what does he mean philip  asked the
padre

   he claims to be selected by the people
of rosalia to drive me out of town i de-
mand the treatment of a citizen and a prop-
erty-holder said philip

    i trust that you will not interfere with
our duty padre said waters

  your first duty is to humanity and
should be tempered with mercy the priest
answered  i know philip garrick and i
will be responsible for him until the morn-
ing

  the other priests of the mission had
gathered around and as philip chatted with
them and told them his experiences of the
night padre gregorio escorted waters and
bender to the mission gates

   against the wishes of the priest the two
representatives of the people were helpless
in those idle early days the church had to be
recognized if it took occasion to interfere in
such a case waters and bender started
down the road muttering curses to them-
selves

   i thought you were to keep near to him
to catch him if he jumped  said waters

   how did i know he was goin to jump 
answered bender  he went like a flash
 anyhow you should have watched him
closer waters went on with some vehe-
mence  its your fault that he got away
in twenty minutes more we would have had
the money

    i didnt want to take him by this road 
    you did 

  i didnt i told you to take him off
into a pasture said bender  and make
him come to time with the cash

    dont argue that now waters broke in
 were the ones whove lost in this game
the father will have him before the court
in the morning and we will be hauled up
as a couple of blackmailers

    if thats so its your fault said bender
 dont say that again what are you
going to do-skip out of town  

    i dont see as there is much else to do
bender answered  if it hadnt been for
you - if i hadnt listened to your fool
scheme-i would have been better off

  seth waters was beginning to inwardly
resent the taunts of his hitherto silent part-
ner he had picked bender to help him
 hold up  philip under the guise that they
were a committee to escort him out of town

  when they reached the border line near
caliente their plan was to bind philip to a
telegraph-pole demand money from him un-
der threat and if he did not come to time
with the cash then they would rob him and
disappear to parts unknown

  as philip was always known to carry a
goodly sum in his pocket die two men knew
that the nights work would not be in vain
it would not have been had their plan suc-
ceeded with the first ray that smote the
east philip rose from his couch and walk-
ing to the offering-box in the little chapel
deposited a handful of bright gold coins-
praying for the safety of his life as he did so

chapter xi
the escape

the long and the short of the quarrel
- between waters and bender was that
bender became so inflamed at his partnffts
words and taunts that he foolishly called
him a liar waters resenting the insult
struck bender bender whipped out his
knife and made a lunge at the ex-deputy


the railroad mans magazine

  waters had only one alternative before
another moment flashed by he had exer-
cised it

  dick bender was a corpse

  waters dragged the body into the brush
and leaned against a fence to think over the
situation

  three problems now confronted him

  firstly philip under the protection of
the mission which had the respect of all
would demand in the morning an under-
standing as to his citizen rights it was one
thins to drive a man out of a community bv
sheer contempt it was another thing to
take him by force when he was a propertv-
holder and claimed the protection of the
law

  secondly he would be utterly routed and
branded as a liar when it was proved that
he was not the appointed officer of a citizens
committee

  thirdly how would he account for the
killing of dick bender who would be-
lieve him if he said that he did it in self-
defense after being stamped as a liar in
connection with philip garrick who would
agree that he had shot his mate in self-
defense he might be charged with mur-
der-and then

  he started down the road he made all
the haste possible to reach rosalia before
midnight the morrow would find him far
away from the shadow of kaweah - far
away from the grasp that the law would
reach out for him

  the scheme to get horses at pete williamss
stable was only a bluff-but straight to this
very stable went seth waters

  a big roan mare was grazing in one of
the pastures near the road seth knew that
she was a good jumper and fleet of foot

  a long rope dangled from her halter
seth grabbed the end of it and after the
fashion of cowboys he passed it through her
mouth in the form of a bit and mounted her
bareback

  he trotted the mare out into the middle
of the corral then turning her head in the
direction of the road dug his feet into her
side and started at a full gallop for the
fence

  it was a five-board affair but she took
it clean and the next instant the roan and
her daring rider were kicking up the dust in
the direction of caliente

  seth knew that she could cover a good ten
miles before she showed any sign of fa-
tigue and then a stop and a rest and she

would be good for another long distance

  by daybreak he thought he could be well
out of the neighborhood-perhaps fifty
miles from his starting-point

  when he came too close to caliente to be
safe he turned his mares head into a road
that ran along the bank of the crood river

  though it was dark along this route
owing to the heavy growth of trees and
chaparral through which the faint starlight
could not penetrate he knew even inch of
the way in harmony with the old saying

 the horse knows the rider the mare
urged by his voice and his heels kept up a
fair canter

  so long as the night held out he was safe
in the morning there might be cattlemen on
the road who would know him but he was
not taking any chances with them

  when morning dawned he would ride
into one of the deep gulleys that skirted the
river there the mare could rest and eat
her fill of the juicy bunch-grass that grew
along the bottoms and drink the cool fresh
water of the crood as for him he would
live on water for a few days lack of food
had no terror for him

  many a time in the old days it had been 
necessary for seth to evade the posse that
was scouring the mountains for a road-
agent when he was supposed to be in visalia
on business when he had found himself
quite an adept at killing and cooking the
wild birds that infest the paradise of the
southern california forests

chapter xii

a shot is fired

thilip garrick deposited all the gold
he had in his pockets in the collection
box that rested in the little chapel then
he went to the first mass for he was a de-
vout worshiper the humble but whole-
some breakfast of the mission priests was as
a feast to him and it was with a lighter
heart than he had known for some days that
he sent word to carmita that padre gregorio
and he had sat up late talking over the whole
matter and that padre gregorio had ad-
vised them not to do anything in haste

   we will hasten into rosalia in the
morning and i am going to have an under-
standing about my position before the court
of justice my defamers must come out in
the open and fight no innocent man need
flee from his accusers-and you and padre
in the hornets nest



gregorio know that i am innocent be
calm and god bless you i will be with
you early in the afternoon philip 

  he despatched this by a cowboy from a
near-by ranch he knew that carmita would
be up early waiting for him to take her to
the altar as he had promised he did not
tell her anything about the affair with
waters and bender it would only worry
her and then it was all over and only an
incident but after all a lucky one thought
philip for it threw him into the counseling
hands of my good friend gregorio

  shall we walk to rosaiia asked
padre gregorio  it is a beautiful morn-
ing just listen to those birds sing and see
the wonderful color of those flowers 

   by all means if it wont tire you

  the priest was a tall dark man the son
of a spanish landholder whose family was
among the first to locate in southern cali-
fornia athletic in every way the walk
appealed to him-and so the two companions
started off filled with the glory of the early
morn

  as they walked along discussing that
matter from many view-points they came to
a place in the road where the usually placid
tracks of wagons and pedestrians seemed to
be disturbed the evidence of a scuffle was
visible and both men remarked that some-
thing out of the ordinary had happened on
that spot

    there has been a fight here said philip

   it looks very much like it answered
the priest  this is a rather lonely spot
and just what i imagine a highwayman
would select for an attack

   philip had raised his head and was look-
ing around his eye caught a trail made
by something having been dragged through
the grass

  this looks suspicious he said as he
followed the lead

   it does most certainly replied the
priest as he followed

  it was only a few steps to dick benders
body it lay there staring up to the morn-
ing sun	

    great heavens  exclaimed philip  it
is the body of one of the men-it is seth
waterss pal what do you think how
do you suppose it-

  padre gregorio broke the succession of
philips questions by saying  he has been
shot we cannot leave his body here 

  they found that they were helpless to

 t o be co

 move it there was only one thing to do
 and that was to cover it with branches and
 make rosalia with all possible haste

   their eager muscles were soon breaking
 the full-leafed branches of the small trees
 and thick growth near the roadside soon
 they had the body completely covered so
 that any who might come along would pass
 it by unnoticed then padre gregorio tied
 his handkerchief around a fence-post to mark
 the spot so that it would be easily found by
 the morgue-messengers

   they hurried on to rosalia a little over
 a mile had to be covered but the men
 walked at a good gait

   they went direct to the town marshal-
 for he was the head of the police force-and
 reported the finding of dick benders body

   in a short time the little town was ablaze
 with the awful news the fact that the body
 had been found by philip garrick and
 padre gregorio at that early hour lent addi-
 tional interest to the affair

   the court convened and philip went be-
 fore the judge and asked that he be given
 the privilege to prove his story regarding
 the death of old caillo and the confession
 of jim gormley padre gregorio pleaded
 with the court for his friend

   this was the topic on one hand while the
 murder of bender excited the other a thou-
 sand conflicting opinions filled the streets
 the courtroom was crowded to suffocation
 and the little square around it was black with
 humanity struggling to get in

   finally philip and the priest appeared at
 the door the crowd surged around them
 men hurled epithets at philip but the good
 gregorio raised his hand and they were
 quiet

    tell us garrick  they shouted  tell
 us and tell the truth

    he will tell all and only the truth said
 padre gregorio when order was restored
  i know this man he is a truthful man 
 i believe him to the core listen to him
 he will tell you all he knows-and it will
 lie the truth

   philip came forward he raised his hand
 for order he smiled removed his hat and
 started to address the multitude he had
 said only a few words about his early life
 in rosalia when a pistol-shot broke the still-
 ness

   philip put his hands to his breast-and
 his good friend padre gregorio caught
 him as he fell

what is the best definition of an electric lo-
comotive 

         	how is the power applied to these
locomotives and how are they operated

  	what is the voltage generally used-o c
h elmira new york

   it is a self-propelled vehicle running on
rails and containing one or more electric motors
which drive the wheels thereby propelling the lo-
comotive and causing it to haul cars

   the motors obtain electrical energy from a
rail laid near to but insulated from the track rails
or from a wire suspended above the track contact
with this wire being made by a trolley or wheel
on the end of a pole mounted on top of the loco-
motive the electric rail called  third rail or
the trolley wire is supplied with electricity by
generators placed in a central station and driven
by steam or gas-engines or water-wheels from
the trolley or the third-rail shoe the current is
conducted to a regulator or controller by means of
which the motors may be started stopped or
driven at any desired speed electric locomotives
are built either with motors mounted so as to drive
the axles through the medium of gear-wheels or
with the motor armature mounted directly on the
axle tn this latter case the motor is called a
gearless motor

   the pressure or voltage at which electric
locomotives arc operated is  to  volts direct

current and from  to  volts if alterna-
ting current is used if by alternating current a
transformer is placed on the locomotive which
lowers the current of the trolley wire to a volt-
age suitable for the motors for certain pur-
poses electric locomotives are built to be operated
by a storage battery this arrangement is only
practicable for yard or switching work where the
battery can be conveniently recharged from an
electric central station

what should be done if the packing should

on the road

  	about how many stay-bolts are there in
the average locomotive boiler

  	when the term boiler brace is used
what docs it mean and how many are there in
the modern boiler

  	if the blower should become disconnected

  	how can it be found whether the double-
heading pipe exhaust-port in the no  et
equipment is stopped up and what should be done
in order to double head if this were the second
engine-r k indianapolis

  	it would largely lie a matter for the good
judgment of the engineer the packing seldom if
ever blows completely out without some prelimi-
nary warning whereupon the gland should be

by the light of the lantern



drawn up its far as it will go no to interfere with
the movement of the throttle rod then it is very
seldom so bad that an old coat or bag thrown over
the gland will not suffice to make matters beara-
ble especially with a passenger-train until you
can get in in the case of a work-train however
or a freight-train with a long distance yet to go
circumstances might justify blowing the steam off
the engine after getting into clear and repacking
the throttle with strips of old air-hose or any-
thing of the kind which you can find

  the writer has frequently seen this done on
mexican roads and some in this country where
the throttle gland was located on top of the boiler
or in the dome it only being necessary to deaden
the fire a little and after filling up the boiler pretty
full-at least so that it will be well over the sheet
while the work is being done-blow the steam off
through the steam-chest relief valves it does not
require more than a very few minutes to repack
the throttle whereupon it only remains tc get the
engine hot again and proceed these are how-
ever extreme instances and are scarcely if ever
necessary or justifiable as has been said

  	eliminating from consideration the radial
stays and considering the stay-bolts proper-that
is the short bolts in the side sheets back-head and
throat-sheet-the number usually runs from 
to  dependent on the size and shape of the
fire-box

  	 the locomotive dictionary compiled
by the american railway master mechanics as-
sociation and accepted as the authority on loco-
motive nomenclature defines boiler bracing as
 the system of stays and braces used in a boiler
to enable its plates to resist the pressure imposed
upon them by steam it thus might be inferred
that the term is of broad application to include
sling-stays radial-stays stay-bolts etc but in the
shops the name brace is generally supposed to
specifically designate the braces which extend
from the back head to the upper shell from the
throat-sheet to the lower shell and from the front
flue sheet to the shell

  these may run as high as fifty in a boiler de-
pendent upon its design and are generally pinned
-to a riveted foot on one end for flexibility and
riveted on the other some designs have a  t 
iron riveted on the back-head to which braces are
pinned to radiate to various points on the shell
in instances where it is possible to brace the dome
on account of its location toward the rear the
writer has heard these braces referred to fre-
quently as  dome stays there is far from being
a uniform understanding among shopmen at least
regarding the names of these parts

  	the blower is unnecessary while the en-
gine is under steam as the draft is created through
the outlet of the exhaust steam through the stack
if it should become disconnected while the engine
was not in motion there would be no artificial
draft in fact no draft other than the natural one
through the stack it could lie created readily
enough however if appliances were at hand by
piping from another engine or putting a stack-

blower in the stack under such conditions the
best move would be to repair it if time permitted

  	in double-heading when the engineer on
the head engine sets the brakes and cannot release
them on the second engine which is the way we
interpret your question the trouble is that port
 u  is stopped up in the automatic brake-valve
as this port is not used much and is liable to stop
up in this case we would disconnect the double-
heading pipe or release could be effected through
the independent brake-valve

   and  you do not mention the style equip-
ment in the question regarding handling the un-
charged cars there is practically no limit to the
number of air-cars which can be handled-all that
the engine can pull at any rate

  a o k waycross georgia- and  yes

          there might be a good chance to
get on as a hostler but little in our opinion as a
switch engineer

  	we have no data in regard to colored fire-
men but pretty sure that there are none employed
in arizona or the akotas

  	the far southwestern states should pre-
sent the best field

ge m san jose california-after a very

	careful review of your problem it would
appear that if the first-class train reaches  a at
 am or as you put it  minutes late it
has caught the new  book  and would be ac-
cordingly handled by the despatcher over the new
route which takes effect with the change of time
this of course is merely our personal view the
movement under such conditions would be han-
dled no doubt through orders to all trains in-
volved we do not believe that an extra would
have the right to run against the first-class train
from either  b  or  c  without orders

  	outside coupled locomotives which is the
prevailing construction in this country have their
cylinders outside the frames and the power is ap-
plied through the medium of the pistons cioss-
heads and main ods to the main driving-wheel at
the crark-pin inside connected locomotives have
their cylinders between the frames thus necessi-
tating a cranked main-axle to which the power
is applied through ihe above mentioned parts


the railroad mans magazine

this latter design was standard in england
and in fact all over europe for over half a cen-
tury but notable departures are in service along
the lines of american practise

  the london and northwestern and the great
western have both practically adopted outside
cylinders as standard the principal advantage
claimed for the inside type was greater stability
when in motion due to the thrust of the recipro-
cating parts being almost directly in line with the
center of the locomotive this whether it amount-
ed to anything or not was completely offset by
the increased cost of maintenance due to the in-
accessibility of the parts when inside connected

portion being about four to one electric the lat-

ag c white river junction vermont-

	we cannot think at this writing of any
railroad employing firemen or trainmen eighteen
years old but many have done so twenty one years
is now the general minimum limit especially in the
instance of firemen as the work has grown pro-
portionately with the increased size of the engines
in the past few years so that it is doubtful if a
person under age would be physically able to
handle it	g

how much coal will a locomotive burn per
hour-g w b oakes north da-
kota

  do you mean a locomotive employed in light
passenger service or in heavy express work one
in way-freight service or fast or slow main-line
freight service and is a compound or a simple
engine incorporated in the question these are
necessary elements to be defined before any at-
tempt could be made to return an answer of any
value the amount of coal burned depends upon
tonnage speed gradients and curves steaming
qualities of the locomotive quality of the coal
and last but not least the skill possessed by the
fireman in heavy and fast passenger service say
from six to eight cars at fifty miles an hour about
sis tons per hundred miles will be readily con-

sumed in heavy freight or  drag  service this
might reach ten tons while a switch engine could
possibly work twenty-four hours with no more
than three tons too many conditions remain to
be reckoned with before any real information can
bo given on this interesting point but with a rea-
sonable amount of data a close estimate could be
made of what a locomotive should burn

what is the pay of both engineers and fire-
men on passenger and freight trains

          	does an engineer lose his position
if his train is wrecked for no carelessness of his
own 

  	are the engines that handled the empire
state express in the year  still in service

  	in what year was the speed of seventy-five
miles an hour first attained by a train-j p
wilmington delaware

  	as we have frequently explained in this
department the pay of engineers and firemen is
entirely dependent on the agreement which their
respective organizations may be able to wake with
the railroad companies there is no real uni-
formity because some men are more clever than
others in talking these things over and naturally
drive a better bargain when the contract or
agreement is made it generally stands about two
years or maybe three years whereupon a new
agreement is formulated thoroughly discussed
and signed by both parties after both parties of
course have made mutual concessions in the
east that is say east of the mississippi river
the pay of passenger engineers is approximately
 per hundred miles if the run is longer than
one hundred miles each additional mile is paid
for usually at the same rate or on the same basis
this arrangement prevails in the instance of both
engineers and firemen whether in passenger or
freight service passenger firemen in this same
territory average  per hundred miles freight
engineers receive an average of about  per hun-
dred miles and freight firemen  west of
the mississippi river the pay will be found im-
proved in either branch of the service on pas-
senger runs the engineer may draw  per
hundred miles in freight service  or more
the pay of firemen in the west in many instances
almost equals that of an engineer on some east-
ern roads rising to  in freight and  in pas-
senger service the above of course are broadly
drawn figures but they should serve to give the
general information which you desire

  	no he is exonerated through the circum-
stance which you mention

you mention and is still in service on the rome

plete history of this locomotive the schedule
speed of the empire state express is about forty-
five miles an hour the  has been rebuilt with
a new boiler since she hauled the empire and
by the light of the lantern



her driving-wheels have been reduced in diameter
from  to  inches

  	there are any number of locomotive speed
records on file but unfortunately they mostly
lack the elements to make them entirely credible
however on november is  the philadel-
phia and reading railroad ran a train from
jdnkintown to a point five miles beyond in 
minutes flat or at the rate of  miles per hour
this of course is the average time there are
few statistics available for single miles and it is
safe to say that  miles an hour for an isolated
mile was made many years ago we have an-
other record on the philadelphia and reading
made on may   between mile-posts  and
 new york division in which the  miles
were covered in  minutes  seconds or at the
rate of  miles per hour this is about as com-
plete as your question can be answered as proba-
bly no one can say when that speed was first
attained for a single mile

ter which docs not assist through the belt-line
tunnel under the city of baltimore up a considera-
bly heavier grade than that which you mention
on one occasion one of these engines pulled twen-
ty-nine loaded cars two engines and a caboose
-the total weight aggregating over  tons in
the majority of instances however where the ton-

nage is heavy and the speed comparatively high
it is considered preferable to use two motors this

  the noise which you mention became noticeable

ago they were not so neat to the pins after a
certain amount of wear as the former style strap-
rods there being no provision for taking up the
wear without renewing the bushing in conse-
quence they rattled somewhat on the pins through
a combination of too loose fit and side play between
the collars of the pin the same condition exists
to-day where frequent renewals of bushings are
not made but as a rule it is only in evidence

a pillage for pie

by emmet f harte

   honk and horace take a tumultuous trip
   out of the frying pan into the pantry

onk ordinarily with a normal
liver and plenty of tobacco
is as free from whimsicality
and petty peevishness as any
old gent of thirty-five on any-
bodys list of friends some
weeks ago however he woke up one morn-
ing with a blue haze on his brain and found
fault with everything

  he complained that the coffee tasted bit-
ter the bacon was too salty the eggs hadnt
been garnered soon enough and the milk
was blinkw also he mentioned a presenti-
ment hed had during the night in a dream

   i dreamed that you and me were lost in
a dark and dreary wood he said mournful-
ly  and that we toiled on and on through
morass and tangle beset by every kind of
trouble and danger you could imagine

   snakes and lizards and stinging insects
swarmed after us and creeping crawling
and slimy things climbed up our breeches-
legs or dropped on us from the dripping
tree-branches overhead

  were going to have bad luck horace
misfortune has camped on our trail i feel
it in my bones

  i knew when you loadedup on that
salmon salad last night that youd be seeing
things before morning i said  you re-
member i warned you about it

  you wanted to hog it all yourself was
the reason he growled

  in our mail that morning was a letter
for honk he read it and groaned

  dont tell me i havent got a clairvoy-
ant sense he said  i knew we were in
for it heres this letter its from a sort
of aunt of mine by matrimony my mothers
brother-in-laws sister della who married
a preacher by the name of yarrick or pare-
gorick or something shes been left a

widow she says-with four small brats as a
legacy and shes dividing up her time
among the relations shes got valhalla
on her list for one month commencing next
monday four brats-he held up an ex-
pressive hand with the thumb sequestered
- four of em to overrun and take posses-
sion waugh its too much

   seems to me i remarked  that shes
straining a point to visit you you ought
to be tickled to death

   i am he snapped  im just gasping
my last now

  well then ill wire her that youre in
the penitentiary or the insane asylum if
you say so and she neednt come hotel
bills for five a month would break us both
up anyhow

  he placed a cadaverous forefinger on his
nose as expressive of profound mental ef-
fort

   better yet he said after a pause
well take a vacation for a spell weve
been needing a rest anyhow my boy you
and i both-

  you can go i interposed  ill stay
we cant both leave at once

  why cant we huh i guess yes
weve had our proboscises on the emery-
wheel now for a good long while you bet
we can leave if i say so let me have that
key ill have a couple of subs here to-
morrow 

  wherell we go i asked after these
preliminaries had beenarranged that was
a point wed overlooked  i choose some-
where where the fish are biting i added
honk was rapidly becoming his old in-
domitable self again

  well go to my aunt emmys on the
upper reaches of big hickory-nut creek
he said  ah my dear horace my mouth
a pillage for pie



waters for some of her fried chicken and
hot cucumber pickles when i was a small
urchin we used to pay aunt emmy a visit
every summer i remember there used al-
ways to be a jar full of spiced peaches in
the spring-house and as i was the oldest
kid by about four or five years i always
led the looters when we made a raid many
a tanning have i got for that very thing
after dinner we packed two suit-cases
with a few necessaries and a good many
unnecessaries of life and honk indited a
letter to his mothers brother - in - laws
sister della stating that owing to a
complete collapse mentally and physically
he had been ordered to the weeds or woods
indefinitely in short we doubted if hed
ever come back

  how do you spell neurasthenia he
asked with a  p like pneumonia
maybe id better call it neurosis or neural-
gia theyre easier to spell

   or noodle-ache i suggested  tell
her you have cold feet fatigue tired feel-
ing bad taste in the mouth listlessness
nausea and pain in the gizzard every time

you think of her and that your expectation
of life is getting shorter every minute
whats worrying me is what sort of a place
this health resort is were going to any-
how honk placed his stub of pencil on
a corner of the table

   along the upper reaches of big hick-
ory creek he said life just trickles
along musically theres none of the boom
and surge the dash and turmoil of the
hurrying flood like were used to they
go to bed sleep soundly get up when they
please work or dont work according to
sweet inclination and their days are long
maybe they just seem long i ven-
tured  ive stayed overnight on a farm
a time or tjvo and they dont have much ex-
citement ill admit a swarm of bees pass-
ing over will attract more notice than a
parade of the regular army in town

  we get off at wheaton junction he
resumed and you go seven miles along
a poetic country road to aunt emmys
its been twelve years since i traveled that
road but i know every pebble i can go
it blindfolded on the darkest night

we came to a place where it was hot enough to fuse fire-clay


the railroad mans magazine

     better wire em were coming i said

    no need of it we can walk out and
  surprise em i can picture aunt emmys
  welcome in my mind nothing else like it
  well well hancock simpson of all
  things how hes growed from a little
  spindlin strip of a boy to a big strappin
  man then shell send one of the kids
  for uncle frank shout for chickens to be
  caught and killed crocks of milk to be
  skimmed and canned fruit and preserves
  to be brought out of the cellar itll be
  great i tell you

    well we hit the trail with our luggage
  as soon as honk got our substitutes well
  pumped up with parting instructions that
  they probably would pay no attention to
  as soon as we were out of sight it was a
  sixteen-hour journey to wheaton junction
  we arrived at that historic speck on the
   map pretty well toward the heated portion
  of the day following

    all was quiet and dusty the sun saw
  us coming and cut across the near way to
  meet us wheaton junction is unimportant
  i dont suppose its ever even been assessed
  in fact theres nothing to it but then
  it isnt on the p and p you know im
  not intimating or inferring or impugning
  i simply state that wheaton junction is not
  on the p and p

    we struck out lugging our suit-cases
  along the unsheltered highway that honk
  knew so well a brief mention of the con-
  tents of those two suit-cases by your leave
  they contained changes of linen under-
  wear socks and so forth of course toilet
  articles such as hair tooth and clothes
  brushes and shaving-tools magazines
  ome ten pounds or so for light reading
  fishing-tackle including rubber boots

   addenda-honks idea three dozen
 lemons for lemonade they weigh some-
 thing too oranges and other tropical
 fruits six or eight pounds for the folks
 tobacco for tired nerves four pounds mis-
 cellaneous matches collapsible drinking-
 cups whisk-broom shoe polish extra col-
 lar-buttons towels soap writing-paper en-
 velopes playing-cards-oh el cetera

    these things were thrown in to make
  weight as it were

    a couple of half leagues onward-our
  burdens by that time had assumed the weight
  of fully six hundred-and we came to a
  place where it was hot enough to fuse fire-
  clay the dust rose up and smote us hip
  and thigh as well as eyes ears nose and

mouth a swarm of gnats attended us and
sweet bees hung on our flanks

   say i said while we paused near the
shade of a milkweed to blow a little  that
poetry you spoke about as being particu-
larly noticeable along this line-quote me
a bar or two it ought to be pretty ardent
stuff

   aw go chase yourself honk grunted
while he wiped the perspiration from his
noble brow  i wouldnt be surprised if
it should rain-its turned so sultry the
humidity is very noticeable in the atmos-
phere

    it and a few other things yes i said
they make it nice how far is it by
civilized reckoning to the next well of
water  

   just around the next turn lie said
a fine old moss-covered one too well
eat our lunch there and cool off under the
big walnut-tree attention company for-
ward march 

  just around the next turn there was a
wheat stubble-field the walnut-tree and
the well had been misplaced honk looked
puzzled for a moment

   i remember now he chuckled foolish-
ly  i had my wires crossed a half-mile
farther is the schoolhouse and then we cross
the creek on a red bridge funny how
memory plays tricks on a person sometimes
the well i spoke about is on beyond that
quite a jog

  never mind i assured him ill
drink out of the creek

  it was farther than any half-mile to the
schoolhouse though it was nearer two
miles liberally measured and when we got
there it had been torn down or moved away
at least honk said it had there was no
sign of it

   we rested in the cool shadow of a thistle-
busli i estimated that the thermometer
stood at one hundred and sixty-nine degrees
fahrenheit the dogs strained at their
leashes and whined for a taste of walrus
blubber we killed and ate our last eskimo
at this camp

  pardon me im crazy with the heat
some little distance beyond where the
schoolhouse wasnt we came to the creek
it was a real bona-fide creek welowered
ourselves down the weed-grown bank to get
a drink

  the water was brackish to the taste and
somewhat hotter than lukewarm it was
covered with a rich dark-green scum we
a pillage for pie



rested for half an hour under the bridge a
buggy passed but it was going the wrong
way-from our point of view

i desired honk to dash out from our
place of concealment and ask the traveler

said nobody but the most ruthless of
vandals would have dared lay an ax to it
well here we are at aunt emmys at last
phew i do believe i smell cherry pre-
serves theres the same old log barn and

how far it was to aunt emmys but he re-
fused he insisted that he knew already
and that no man needs a corroboration of
positive knowledge a measured mile and
a quarter was the exact distance he said
as a sort of foot-note in explanation i
will state that it took two hours hard walk-
ing to negotiate it however

  we tacked into harbor at aunt emmys
somewhere about three bells with helm hard
aport and soused the staboad anchor
honk was still muttering and grumbling in
reference to the villain or villains that had
been guilty of cutting down the walnut-tree
at his dear old moss-covered well some
miles back we didnt find the well but we
viewed the former site of it

  that walnut-tree was a landmark he

thats a good one on you aunt emmy
youll have to treat on that

the pig lot and everything just as i saw it
last here comes the dogs i dont see
anybody stirring around the house well
probably find aunt emmy about the kitch-
en get out you  the latter to a yellow
dog of doubtful pedigree who was ma-
neuvering to secure a souvenir from honks
leg

  there were three dogs they convoyed
us to the back door whither we steered our
course a lean pessimistic-looking woman
took our measure from within she hooked
the screen door tentatively she had the nose
oi catherine of russia the eyes of semi-
ramis and a hapsburg chin

 why aunt emmy cried honk
 howdy-do you dont know me no moren
a rabbit do you thats a good one on


the railroad mans magazine

you aunt emmy youll have to treat on
that all right she dont know her own
nephew horace what do you think of
that  

it aint hancock simpson is it she
said uncompromisingly

 it is said honk  whats left of him

and sammys gone to kansas city willie
and seth are still at home and ruth shes
going on twelve now theyre all down on
the creek somewheres except frank he
went to the county seat to pay his taxes to-
day

  honk brushed aside ten or a dozen flies

they worked a skin game on honk and me by passing things so they would

reach us last

how are you anyhow aunt emmy let
me introduce to you my old side-partner
horace weve come all the way from val-
halla just to pay you all a visit

  she unlatched the screen door without en-
thusiasm and passed around a limp hand
for us to shake

   set down she invited  if you can find
yourselves some chair- i hardly knowed
you hancock youve shot up taller but
you always was thinlike when did you
hear from your nia

  not so very long ago shes making
her home with clara now clara was the
youngest girl you know shes married and
 ives in st paul hows uncle frank ma-
king it

  nothing extra hes troubled with the
rheumatiz quite a lot esthers married

that were fighting for first place on his nose
and wondered if a cold drink wouldnt do
us both good i admitted my willingness
to try the experiment aunt emmy made
no move to alleviate our sufferings she
didnt seem thirsty herself

  the house was simply swarming with
hies their buzzing made a dull humming
sound that reminded one of a bee-hive  a
busy day several chickens and one full-
grown goose came up on the front porch
and peered in through the screen at us

  well lets get outside and take a look
around horace honk proposed  dont
go to any extra trouble for us aunt emmy
were just home folks you know

  she didnt mention having contemplated
any such thing

  we sought and found the well its hoist-
a pillage for pie



ing apparatus was of the old-fashioned
bucket and pulley variety it would have
been improved by the addition of another
bucket we drank and renewed our lease
of life

  after which we observed the chickens
viewed the pigs noted the calf lying in the
barn lot inspected the orchard with its
dozen or so gnarled and ancient seedling
apple-trees and remarked the general run-
down and careless appearance of everything
about the place it was most exciting

  the fences were tumble-down the corn-
crib tottery and undermined by the rats
while broken-down and weather-beaten cul-
tivators and other farming implements and
tools littered outlying nooks and corners
andan air of poverty-stricken abandonment
clung to everything in sight

  a man with a hammer and a pocketful
cf nails could do some business in this
vicinity i remarked not to mention
paint and putty and a mowing scythe after
these weeds there are some there as high
as a horses head

   youre right honk agreed disgusted-
ly things do seem to be in need of a
general shaking up this dump is on the
greased slide that leads to the bow-wows
say wouldnt i like to jump a gang of our
boys into this rat-harbor and rejuvenate
things for about a week  

  we opened a bent and decrepit gate and
wandered across the pasture to the creek
no rest was there for us for the mosquitoes
nailed us at sight and it had been a right
prolific year for the species apparently

  i saw at a glance the kind of fishing
big hickory-nut creek would afford no
self-respecting bull-head would even sojourn
in a hog-wallow like that for any length of
time

  two or three sad-eyed cows regarded us
reproachfully from the water where they
had sought refuge from the flies a gray
horse with a string-halt stepped out from
behind a clump of trees and favored us with
a long irritating stare

  we didnt see willie seth or ruth dur-
ing our ramble we learned later that they
had gone blackberrying farther up the creek
the result of their foray being a scant quart
brought back in a hat plenty enough for a
pie or two but we didnt have pie at supper
so you could notice it

  aunt emmys family gathered at the fes-
tal board for supper likewise honk and i
distinguished guests from afar likewise
 r r

myriads of buzzing flies that we fought
hand to hand for every bite it was a mea-
ger supper there was bread and some
butter and water to wash it down with

  aunt emmy explained diat they sold die
cream and fed the skim milk to the calves
she remarked that we could have had eggs
for supper if somebody had looked for em
she said the hens stole their nests out
whatever that meant

  the family had unique table manners
they grabbed for the best on every dish and
worked a skin game on honk and me by
passing things so they would reach us last
it was a case of every fellow for himself
and-thats an old saw you know the rest

  uncle frank was a morose old soul

  talking seemed both painful and de-
pressing to him it hurt him to say any-
thing and when he did his spirits fell im-
mediately he peered underneath and saw
the side theyd neglected to varnish of every-
thing he had a way of smacking his lips
and clucking while eating that endeared
him to me right away-over the left

  not being adept at the methods in vogue
at table honk and i came perilously near
losing out entirely on our supper it was
simply a case of the family beating us to
it and they were more familiar with the
ground

  if we were to dine there again however
ill bet you i would make a showing id
pounce on everything in reach dump it on
my plate and commence chewing and
growling if necessary id repel the other
boarders nautically speaking with knife
and fork and use my nose and tongue for
eating

  when the bread and butter had disap-
peared the assembled company looked
around hungrily to make sure that the feast
was over then they left the table one by
one without undue formality or ceremony
we followed honks cherished uncle to the
porch where he sat himself on the only
chair and filled and lit his pipe we
whirled around a few times shook ourselves
and reclined on the floor with our feet hang-
ing over the edge

  honk began to simmer gently prepara-
tory to a long and eloquent session in which
if i mistook not uncle frank would hear
some pointers about modern scientific meth-
ods as applied to agricultural pastoral and
horticultural pursuits el cetera

   how much land do you own now un-
cle honk asked preliminarily


the railroad mans magazine

   only an eighty after a pause  an
its pretty well in debt

  lets see said honk an eighty
well watered and in the rain-belt you
can successfully raise here corn wheat oats
barley broom-corn sugar-cane and every
variety of vegetable and fruit except the
semi-tropical kind besides cattle hogs
horses mules sheep goats and poultry
yet you say youre mortgaged maybe
youve got a screw loose somewhere
uncle frank didnt seem impressed to the
point of replying

   the old slipshod system of farming in
this country honk continued has been
relegated to the rear we now farm scien-
tifically a man should figure profit and
loss on every cow pig and hen eliminate
the drones watch the corners improve in-
tensify and specialize

  ten acres properly handled is better
than a hundred acres mismanaged out in
our country we-

   seth  bawled the old fellow sudden-
ly  have you milked yet   from some-
where in the distance a voice replied
naw we aint

  you boys git at that milkin now 
there was no reply presumably the boys
were gitting at it

  take small fruits for instance honk
resumed

  an acre of strawberries will yield at
a conservative estimate two hundred crates
at two dollars a crate you have four hun-
dred dollars the cost of the crates and
picking comes out of course say fifteen per
cent but you have left a neat sum

   then there are blackberries and rasp-
berries the three of them ripening as they
do at different periods make an ideal crop
venture no venture either its as certain
as sunrise

  five acres of small fruits rightly han-
dled and marketed would give you a net in-
come of from three to four thousand dollars
annually

  take broom-corn potatoes celery on-
ions an acre of onions will knock the
props out from under ten acres of corn the
best day com ever saw buckwheat and
bees will beat corn

   you ought to have a two-horse power
gasoline-engine over there in the creek and
an irrigated celery-patch that would bring
you in fifty dollars a week man youve
got a mint here and the weeds are taking
it-

  seth you boys done that milkin yet

  again the voice from afar  well im-
patiently  were goin in a minute 

  honk wiped the sweat from his hard-
working face uncle frank seemed a hide-
bound proposition withal his redoubtable
nephew made one more assault upon his out-
ward show of indifference

  a dozen jerseys honk said would
put you in the clear about two hundred a
month you could afford a new automo-
bile once a year if youd work it right and
as to hogs and poultry-theys my hobby
i-

  uncle frank sighed and knocked the ash-
es from his pipe

  ill have to whale them durned boys
before i can git em started he said and
limped into the house leaving us flabber-
gasted and alone i rose quietly and made
a dive for the chair honk had anticipated
the move and was a scarce two inches
ahead of me so he got it

   only the rich can enjoy the luxuries
of life he remarked  but laying per-
siflage aside we ought to get these people
pried out of their rut some of these days
this farm will turn into a big burdock and
jimpson reserve if we dont to-morrow
im going to take that old man to pieces
and overhaul and oil him up until hell be
practically a new machine

  we sat on the porch until late nobody
disturbed us aunt emmy came after i
had taken one nap and reported that our
bed was ready whenever we felt irresistibly
inclined toward an armed engagement with
morpheus

  our slumber-chamber was located in im-
mediate juxtaposition with and to the kitch-
en in the small of the kitchens back as
it were as we found when we staggered
thither

  it was poorly ventilated with one port-
hole we might have quibbled at the bed
only one should not pry into and investigate
too closely the mouth of a gift horse be-
sides we were dead tired and hungry

  ill make no comment on the bed other
than to say that ive slept-and slept sound-
ly and restfully-on baggage-trucks crates
of machinery floors of silvery oak and even
piles of railroad iron but that my rest was
broken on aunt emmys company bed

  we turned in honk and i the afore-
said morpheus spat on his hands and ma-
neuvered for his famous toe-hold just be-
fore lie closed with us something happened
a pillage for pie



morpheus threw up his hands and fled
wildly honk began to paw and scrape at
himself

   theres a spider or something crawling
on my face he said ouch im bit

  i secured a match from a convenient vest-
pocket struck it and looked they were
scurrying to cover in all directions the sheet
and pillows were dotted with
them when i say  they i make
no reference to spiders i saw no
spiders

  a spider is a well-mannered 
gentlemanly bug - a rare artisan  
in shimmery fabrics gossamer
and elusive flimsy and fine as the

may his childrens children dry up become
transparent and blow away on the wings of
a hot wind

  honk and i hopped out of bed in a hurry
honk cooled his fevered brow at the port-
hole and then i cooled mine there wasnt
room for more than one fevered brow at a
time at that particular port-hole

o

v



honk had antici-
pated the move

dainty raiments of fairies he constructs
rare geometrical designs in spun silk more
delicate in texture than anything else ever
woven in this world i could sing all night
in praise of my hairy friend the spider

  but-i compose no poetry nor chant no
encomiums dedicated to the rascally insect i
have inmind he is a night prowler a
coward n vampire and a sneak he sallies
from ambush attacks and scurries back
into hiding

  no bigger than the mole on your neck
he has the voracity of a tiger the capacity
of a glutton and the audacity of a brainless
fool ugh a volley of curses on him

  we cant sleep in no such buggery as
that honk whispered  horace there
wouldnt be a greasy spot left of us by day-
light

   sh-sh  i warned him  somebodys
in the kitchen hist

  there was the sound of bare feet spat-
ting guardedly against the uncarpeted floor
then the faint clatter of tinware

   maybe some marauder has obtained an
entrance and is filching the pewter i
whispered we tiptoed across the treacher-
ous floor lest it creak and betray us and
opened our door a few inches breathlessly

  a blood-curdling sight met our gaze


the railroad mans magazine

   by the dim light of a coal-oil lamp turned
low we descried a figure of a man bending
over the table we could see the nefarious
work at which he was busy he was just
lapping up the remains of a fat and juicy
blackberry pie and-horrors-it was un-
cle frank

  i knew him by the smack and cluck of

his mouth when he had cleaned the plat-
ter he extinguished the lamp and padded
softly through the doorway leading into
the front room

  honk revived with a snort the minute he
had gone

  lets get our duds on and get out of
this he proposed huskily  that last was
the one thing needed to break down the
corral fence no man can eat pie under
my nose without offering me any and then
brag that hes my kin-folks i repudiate
em im through with em a bus and
avaunt with all of em 

   what about elevating em out of their
rut i asked as i laced my shoes

  ptt he sputtered like an engine
climbin a flight of steps on the inill speed
 i dont waste none of my time with such
swine i dont think get the grips out-
side while i take a look for something to
eat maybe i can unearth another pie

   i returned without unnecessary delay

  honk had the lamp lighted and was
making a silent but painstaking search
through the larder-and to advantage

  aunt emmy was a deceiver she had
good things galore in concealment a big
cake a platter of fried chicken two or three
pies and preserves jams and jellies to make
your eyes water

 here are those lemons and oranges we
brought too whispered honk theyve
got them salted away for future reference
well painful though it be to me well have
to break into aunt emmys plans wheres
a sack that basket will do well take
the best only and chuck the balance in the
pig-trough as we depart

  once outside the gate
and on the main highway
to wheaton junction we
waded into that basket of
eatables mile after mile
went into the discard but
we ate our way forward
behind us we left a trail
of chicken bones jam-
glasses and fragments of
pie crust

  we were tired when we
got to wheaton junction
-yes very tired but
not hungry glory be-
not hungry 

  when the red motor-
car rolled into valhalla
next afternoon honk and
i were on board it we tumbled off blithe-
somely

   ah thats the kind of a town to live in
and there was the medicine house-dear
old clean comfortable medicine house

  well i said we dodged cousin del-
la and side-stepped aunt emmy and uncle
frank hurrah for us me for a bath
honk waved a greeting to one of our
substitutes who was gaping out of the tick-
et-window

  wasnt looking for you back so soon
uite the man said  whered you go
millardsville say there was a lady
come in on the train this morning and
she was in here asking about you she
had four kids with her i wont be abso-
lutely certain but i think she went up to
the palazzo and engaged rooms and board
for a month at your expense your aunt
isnt she-er-er-

  oh shut up said hohk of course
shes my aunt what of it

the railroads war on dust

by charles frederick carter

 ever since trains- have been running faster than six miles an hour a small
 army of inventors have been struggling valiantly to find an effective
 weapon to combat those ancient enemies of the traveler-dust and
 cinders

      hundreds of devices have been patented to rid passenger-coaches of these
 products of the engine and the right-of-way but one by one they have been put
 to the test and failed

      the nearest approach to anything like a successful ventilating system was
 that adopted by the pennsylvania railroad a number of years ago but as it pro-
 vided only one-third the amount of air that theoretically should be in circulation
 it can hardly be regarded as efficient rock-ballasted roadbeds and the occa-
 sional use of crude petroleum on the right-of-way however have rendered
 traveling so very endurable that it can hardly be compared with the days of
 mud-ballasted tracks and wood-burning locomotives

what the railroads have done toward overcoming the smoke and dust
nuisance from early days up to the present time and
some of the results accomplished

hen the blessing of rail-
roads was conferred up-
on the people of the
united states their first
transports of delight were
tempered by the discov-
ery that speed was not to be had without
the accompanying vexation of dust cinders
and smoke immediately hosts of inventors
deluged the patent-office and harried the
life out of railroad officers with all sorts
of impracticable schemes to abate the nuis-
ance and incidentally make the fortunes
of the geniuses who devised them

  this self-appointed task was handed
down unfinished to their children and to
their childrens children even at the pres-
ent day though the work has been taken up
by one of our greatest railroad systems
which has kept a force of experts at work
on the problem of dust-prevention and car
ventilation for ten long years that particu-
lar fly has not yet been removed from the
ointment

  if one keeps in mind the mud ballast
which was the only kind known to early
railroad builders and the stuffy cramped
unventilated boxes that passed for cars it

is not difficult to accept this description
of conditions from the american railroad
journal of june  s as a conservative
statement of facts

   as the season advances travelers by
railroad suffer almost inexpressibly by dust
and heat those who have never experi-
enced it can hardly realize the sensations
of thirst half-suffocation and blindness
which are occasioned by a long days travel
in unventilated cars if you close the win-
dow you parch if you open it for air your
eyes are filled with heated cinders and
smoke while your clothes are covered and
nose and throat choked with the dust you
respirate

  the cincinnati gazette in the same year
declared that the dust on the railroad jour-
ney between columbus and cleveland re-
minded one of an ohio river fog which
forces steamers to tie up  the heat said
this paper  aggravates the sufferings of the
passengers the air is heated to the boiling
point and thickened with dust until it is
like gruel

  in cooler weather the sufferings of the
unlucky traveler were still worse if such
were possible although established for the
express purpose of advocating railroads the
american railroad journal in its issue of
september   burst out in a long
tirade in which it complained that often
forty more passengers than there were seats
were packed into a car while the platforms
also were crowded apparently very much
like the street-cars in any big city during
the rush hours at the present day

when travel was torture

  the floor was covered with tobacco-juice
orange and apple peelings peanut-shells
and similar debris while the windows often
had not been cleaned for months the red-
hot -tove gave forth assorted odors of singed
coats toasted rubbers and smoldering quids
while untold sums had been spgnt for dec-
oration- there was not a hole of any size for
the admission of air

  from such conditions as these it would
seem that railroad officials were driven to
seek relief in self-defense one of the
earliest schemes for getting rid of dust to
attract favorable attention was the joint in-
vention of john ross and w e rutter of
elmira this was simply a tank having a
capacity of two thousand gallons mounted
on four wheels with a sprinkling-pipe six

feet eight inches long carried ten inches
above the rails

   the sprinkler was coupled in behind the
tender the enthusiastic inventors claimed
that their sprinkler moistened the air sur-
rounding the cars reduced the friction be-
tween the wheels and the rails prevented
bearings from heating and protected paint
and varnish which seems a good deal to
expect of fifty gallons of water sprinkled
over a mile of dusty railroad or a pint to
every thirteen lineal feet of track great
stress was laid on the ingenious arrange-
ment by which the engineer shut off the
sprinkling water with the same movement
with which he closed the throttle

attempts to dampen the dust

  this track-sprinkler was tried on the
boston and providence and the boston and
stonington railroads where it gave so much
satisfaction that the new england associa-
tion of railroad superintendents repre-
senting twenty-five railroads of which w
raymond lee superintendent of the boston
and providence was president at its meet-
ing on july   adopted the report
of its committee on track-sprinklers saying

    your committee is fully convinced of
the utility of the track-sprinkler in connec-
tion with railroad trains its use promotes
the comfort of passengers keeps the cars
clean and the bearings more free from dust
we recommend iron tanks and more water
say one hundred gallons per mile for pas-
senger-trains at thirty miles an hour

   in spite of this strong indorsement the
track-sprinkler dropped quickly out of sight
and was never heard of afterward

   other early inventors ignored the track
altogether and sought only to keep the dust
out of the cars after it had been stirred up
by the train included in the average of
one dust-prevention scheme a week present-
ed at the patent-office for a considerable
period was a plan by bromley of new
haven in  he put paddle-boxes on
the wheels like those on a side-wheel steam-
boat to hold the dust down and stretched
rubber aprons between the cars to prevent
the dust- from rising

  a modification of bromleys plan was
tried on the michigan central a screen of
tarred canvas was hung outside the wheels
from the bottom sills of the cars to within
two inches of the rails the screens were
joined together from car to car to form a
the railroads war on dust



continuous tunnel under the train through
which it was hoped the dust would have
the decency to pass and leave the passengers
alone but it didnt the bromley idea
was again revived in  by e c salis-
bury of new york with no better success

  a scheme that was tried on the erie rail-
road won the admiration of david steven-
son frse an englishman who made a
couple of trips to die united states to study
the railroads the first being in s the
erie car-ventilating apparatus consisted of
a ventilating-hood something like those in
use on steamships on each end of the car

  the motion of the car forced a current
of air through this ventilating-hood into a
chamber into which water was sprayed by
a pump driven by a belt from an axle to
wash the dust and cinders out the puri-
fied air was then conveyed into the car
there was a heater to warm the water in
cold weather stevenson found several cars
so equipped and recommended the device
for use on english roads

devices to catch the cinders

  something like the erie plan was the in-
vention of ii ruttan of coburg canada
ruttan must have been a good promoter
for he made vigorous use of printers ink
and his persuasive powers were so great that
he induced the rochester and syracuse
railroad to try his plan in  while the
new york central and the erie experiment-
ed with it in  the boston and lowell
tried it in  and the grand trunk fitted
up seven cars equipped with his device
during the same year

  ruttan first captured his air with a re-
ceiving box  on top of the car from whence
it was conducted through flues in the sides
of the car to a shallow tank beneath the
floor the tank was the full width of the
car and sixteen feet long and was to have
one inch of water in it this one inch of
water being supposed to stay evenly dis-
tributed over the bottom of the tank regard-
less of the motion of the car in going around
curves and up and down grades was ex-
pected to catch all the dust and cinders md
detain them by force while the purified air
rose through two pipes or pedestals five feet
high into the car in winter one pedestal
was closed and a stove was placediver the
odier to heat the air still this did not
answer

a mechanic named cunningham of

reading pennsylvania thought the prob-
lem was not to keep out the dust but to
evict it after it had entered the car so in
 he patented a scheme for blowing
a jet of air across the windows by means
of a fan driven by a belt from the axle work-
ing in a chute

  the railroad car-ventilating company
was organized in new york in  to buy
and exploit the patent car-ventilating sys-
tem of h m paine experiments were
made with the paine system on the nashua
and worcester and the new york and new
haven railroads in  but they were not
satisfactory

  paines plan like a number of others
was to take air from the top of the car and
force it over the surface of water with the
expectation that the water would take up
the objectionable dust and cinders the
windows being designed as a part of the
ventilating system opened vertically down
the middle the front leaf of the window
was supposed to be swung out thus forming
an angle that would deflect the dust and
cinders so they could not enter

  about the same time c lancaster pat-
ented a plan for an air-chute on top of the
cars and extending the length of the train
connections between cars being made with
springs just as a modern vestibule is held
together air as taken in behind the en-
gine before it had a chance to be contam-
inated and conveyed to all the cars through
the chute and side-fiues in the walls of the
cars

improved ventilation

  waterbury  atwood of birmingham
connecticut improved on lancasters plan
by taking air from the sides of the tank
farther away from the smoke as it rolled
back over the train and combining with the
air-duct the first attempt at a vestibule
although waterbury  atwood secured a
letter from e f bishop president of the
naugatuck railroad declaring that after
a years trial their system of ventilation
had proved perfectly satisfactory in opera-
tion and though they succeeded in having
a train on the new jersey railroad fitted up
with their system they never got any far-
ther with it more than thirty years later
f u adams of chicago incorporated a
precisely similar plan of ventilation in the
wind-splitting train for which he obtained
a patent


the railroad mans magazine

  in spite of all these attempts the ven-
tilation of cars was notoriously bad until
the late s when the clearstory or mon-
itor-roof began to be introduced the
windows or transoms in the clearstory af-
ford the nearest approach to ventilation
that is to be found on most roads to-dav
but this primitive device is so lamentably
deficient that in s the pennsylvania
railroad detailed a commission to find
something better

  although the commissions assignment
was to devise a system of ventilation it was
specifically reminded of the necessity of
excluding those ancient enemies dust and
cinders a series of exhaustive tests ex-
tending over ten years was carried out
analyses of the air in coaches and sleepers
showed that only from one-sixth to one-
tenth of the air necessary to maintain good
hygienic conditions passed directly through
the cars

  further experiments demonstrated the
impossibility of securing true ventilation by
exhausting the air from the car by way of
the roof and allowing it to enter where it
can that is an intake as well as an
outlet was needed it required an infinite
amount of experimenting to get the details
of the intake down to a satisfactory working
basis but it was done at last very early in
the experiments the commission gave up all
idea of securing the ideal circulation of one
hundred and eighty thousand cubic feet per
minute as wholly impracticable and set the
standard at one-third the amount

  the intake-hoods placed at diagonally
opposite corners of the roof have openings
of one hundred square inches the air

passes from the hoods down through the
sides of the car to ducts under the floor ex-
tending the whole length of the car there
are pockets in these ducts to catch the coarser
cinders and dust from the ducts the air
passes over steam-pipes which heat it in
winter into the aisle at the end of each seat
near the floor the system in fact is no
more nor less than a scientific development
of some of the earlier failures

  seven ventilators in the roof one over
each gas-lamp and one at each end allow
the vitiated air to escape the windows in
the monitor-roof are not made to open a
carload of workmen from the altoona shops
were paid their regular wages to ride up
and down the road in one of the experi-
mental cars to test the new system before it
was accepted the plan having withstood
every test satisfactorily the workmen reluc-
tantly returned to their benches in the shops
and orders were given for installing the new
system on a large scale

  if our fathers could make such a fuss
over a little clean prairie soil mixed with
their air and seasoned with woocl-smoke
what would they say to the dust of the new
york subway dr george a soper found
upon investigation that sixty per cent of
the subway dust is an impalpable powder
of iron which is ground off the brake-slioes
at the rate of one ton per mile per month
besides this there is a considerable quantity
from the contact-shoes and from the wear
and tear of the rails but there need be
no fear of this annual output of two hundred
tons or so of powdered iron blocking the
costly road for the passengers kindly carry
it out free of charge in their lungs

horse-power of the fireman

until the automatic stoker comes into gen-
eral use the main object and aim of im-
proved locomotive design is to increase the net
ietum of the firemans work that the mallet
compound locomotives mark a tremendous advance
in this direction is generally known but it proba-
bly is not generally understood that an advance of
practically one hundred per cent has been made
by the introduction of this type of locomotive in
ether words that it permits one fireman to de-
velop practically double the draw-bar pull that
was previously his maximum

  service tests on the lines of the delaware and
hudson company show this fact very clearly
tin- mallet which has exactly the same amount of

grate area as the consolidation type pusher did an
amount of work equal to two of these engines
with practically the same amount of coal used on
one of them

  even then this amount wasnot as large as fire-
men have shown themselves capable of handling
per hour for a somewhat longer period than was
required on this run when one fireman can de-
velop practically one hundred thousand pounds of
draw-bar pull for two hours continuously who
dares to say what tractive effort will be obtained
from locomotives when the automatic stoker be-
comes thoroughly perfected a condition which
now does not seem to be so far in the future-

by s o conley

         an incident of the old stage-coach days which
         was remembered after the steam-horse was born

               y story is of the bygone days
                  when railroads were only
                  beginning to be talked of
                  and were the standing joke
                   of travelers and theoretical
                  philosophers

   we shall have a moist night of it sir
said the driver of the coach from boston to
new york to a young man who shared the
coach-box with him  will you be kind
enough to hold the reins while i slip on my
coat 

  a stormy night too he added when
that operation was performed  there was
a flash we shall soon be in the thick
of it

   with all my heart said arthur wil-
lis  i dont mind a little damp but cant
you give the poor woman a place inside
there are no inside passengers i think

  the words were kindly spoken and the
woman looked thanks to the young man
who for his part seemed rather to enjoy the
pelting rain which succeeding a hot july
day was laying the dust of the broad turn-
pike and stirring up a refreshing scent from
the meadows and hedges which lined it

  beautiful grand exclaimed the
young man suddenly before the driver had
time to reply to his question as a vivid flash
of forked lightning followed by a loud peal
of thunder caused the high-bred horses to
plunge in their traces and proved the
drivers anticipations to be correct and in
course of speedy fulfilment

  the same flash and peal which startled
the horses and excited the admiration of
the young traveler drew from the poor wom-
an just behind him a faint cry of alarm

  on turning his head arthur willis saw
that she was pale and trembling and that

the infant she carried was convulsively
clasped to her bosom he saw too that the
slight summer cloak she wore and the ad-
ditional shawl which she had drawn over
her bonnet and spread around her baby
were an insufficient protection from the fast-
falling rain

    surely you will let her get inside he
said compassionately poor thing she
and her child will be wet through in another
five minutes	

    we will change horses directly replied
the driver  and then i will see what i can
do the owner of this here stage is very
particular if he were to know of my
doing such a thing i should get a dressing
but on such a night as this is like to be-

  the coach drew up at a road-house
while the four panting steaming horses
were exchanged for a team fresh from the
stable the young woman and her infant
were transferred from the outside to the in-
side of the coach

  the storm increased in its fury as the
evening drew on the lightning was fear-
fully brilliant and almost incessant the
thunder was terrific and the rain poured
down in torrents

  the three or four passengers who were
riding outside wrapping themselves up in
comfortable water-proof coats and cloaks
and pulling their hats over their eyes si-
lently wondered whea it would be over only
now and then expressing a fear which
seemed not without foundation that the
horses could not stand it much longer and
that the off leader especially would soon
bolt

  the thunder-storm had partially abated
but the rain still poured down heavily as
the driver threw the ribbons to the hos-


the railroad mans magazine

tier and a waiter from the road-house ven-
tured out on the muddy road to announce
that the coach would remain there half an
hour and that supper was on the table

  glad to change his position and not un-
mindful of the demands of a youthful and
sharp appetite arthur willis jumped down
and was entering the supper-room when a
loud altercation at the door arrested his at-
tention

  is sh an inside passenger i ask
thats all i want to know  the voice
was domineering and fierce

  no sir she is not said the driver
 but she has a child and is going all the
way to new york and isnt over and above
weil-clothed for the night u-aveling there
wasnt any one inside and the storm came
on so i thought there wasnt any harm-

  the driver was interrupted in his apology
and explanation by the coarse declaration
that if he didnt mind what he was about he
could hunt another job the boss also in-
sinuated that there was some understanding
between the driver and the woman about an
extra fee

  there isnt anything of the sort re-
plied the driver bluntly  and heres a gen-
tleman pointing to arthur willis who
had come forward a few steps  who can
tell you so he knows when and why i
put the woman inside

  ardiur willis briefly explained that at
his earnest solicitation the poor woman was
accommodated with an inside place when
the storm came 

   she would have been drenched to the
skin by diis time he added if she had
retained her former seat on the top of the
coach

   that doesnt signify retorted the boss
he was ieter stuggins owner of the road-
house and one of the coach proprietors on
his overbearing and defiant address the out-
ward costume of a gentleman sat misfitting-
ly while hi- temper was probably rough-
ened by the light load of the coach that
night

   if the woman goes inside she must pay
inside fare thats all and returning to
the coach-door he placed the alternative
before the traveler

  without any further reply than that she
was unable to accede to the demand the
young mother was about to step out into the
soaking rain when arthur willis gently
interfered

   you surely do not mean to turn the

poor woman and her baby out into the
rain  he said  it may cause her death to
be exposed through the whole night i
dare say she is not much used to traveling
she has nothing to wrap round her but a
thin shawl

   i cant help that said peter stuggins
sharply as if the interference of the young
traveler were a piece of gratuitous imperti-
nence  the young woman should have
taken care of that herself

  t did not think of its being such a night
when the coach started the woman said
in a soft gentle voice  if i had known it
i would have stayed in boston for the
night i had nothing warmer to put on
but i dare say i shall do very well she
added resignedly  at least if it wasnt for
the poor baby

  wrapping the object of her solicitude as
warmly as she could in her shawl she was
about to step from the coach when young
willis again interfered

   it is a great shame he said indig-
nantly and i shouldnt have expected-
 i should like to know what business
you have to interfere said stuggins hotly
 you had better pay the inside fare for her
yourself if you think so much about it
very well i will said willis please
keep your seat my good woman and ill
make it all right

   i couldnt think of it sir she replied
but before she could frame a remonstrance
stuggins and her young champion had both
disappeared while she was hesitating
what to do next the coachman came for-
ward and informed her that she was to
keep her inside place the rest of the way
this settled the matter

   come mr willis shouted a voice
from the restaurant of the road-house  you
are going to help us arent you theres
room in the coach but you must make haste
about it no time like the present it
will soon be  times up gentlemen  
thank you replied arthur but i
am not going to take supper this evening
the extra fare had dipped deeply into a
purse not very well lined if the poor
woman had known the penance to which her
young champion doomed himself as the
price of his generosity and how in the
drenching rain which lasted all the remain-
der of the journey he was fain to content
himself with munching and mumbling a
dry biscuit just to amuse his internal econ-
omy with the hope of something better to
the wealth of arthur willis



follow she would not have passed the night
so comfortably as she did

  in due time however the coach drove up
to the office of the ardsley inn where in
the early morning a pleasant-looking
manly young mechanic was waiting its ar-
rival a gleam of satisfaction passed over
his countenance as he scrutinized the roof
of the stage

   im glad she didnt come through on
such a night as this has been he said to a
fellow workman by his side  she is deli-
cate and timid and wasnt well provided
with clothes and the poor baby-

    here alex  the voice of his wife from
the open coach-window stopped short the
young mans colloquy he hastened to
greet her

   bless you edith i thought you
wouldnt have come in such weather and i
didnt think to look for you inside any-
how

   oh i wanted to get home so badly
said the young wife putting her baby into
its fathers arms whereupon it began to
kick and crow besides she added it
didnt seem like rain when we left boston
or perhaps i mightnt have come

   well i am glad you were able to get
an inside place

  that would have been impossible
said edith if it hadnt been for a young
gentleman -and she looked around to
thank her friend afresh just in time to see
him turn the corner of a street

  there i am vexed she said on
her way home she gave her husband a full
account of her journey

  a few weeks afterward one sunday
morning as arthur willis and his sister
were walking toward church he passed a
respectable young couple in one of whom
die recognized the woman of the stage inci-
dent it was plain that he too was re-
membered for in another minute the man
had turned and was at his elbow

  excuse my freedom he said but i
wish to thank you for your kindness to
edith-my wife i mean-that terrible
night she came down from boston

  dont speak about it replied willis
i am glad  was able to give a little as-
sistance but it isnt worth mentioning i
hope your wife didnt suffer any it was
a bad night

   not the least in the world sir but she
would have fared badly if she had come all
the way outside of the coach she had

been to boston to see her sick mother and
hadnt more than enough to pay her fare
home i think you are money out of pocket
sir the man added after a little hesitation
 and if you wouldnt be offended at my of-
fering to pay back-

   not a word about it my good fellow
i couldnt think of it-

    then sir i must thank you and hope
 to be able to return the kindness some other
 way the man rejoined his young wife

    what new friend have you picked up
now arthur   asked his sister when the
short conference was ended and what is
that about the coach i understand now
why you had to borrow of me the day after
your journey

   well never mind now jessy ill tell
 you all about it some day said arthur

   years passed and arthur willis now a
man in his own right was again a traveler
from boston to new york but by a dif-
ferent mode of conveyance

   it was a dark afternoon in winter when
 he boarded the  fast express wrapping
 a railway blanket around him and ex-
 changing his hat for a fur cap which he took
 from his pocket he leaned back in a com-
 fortable corner and half closing his eyes
 waited patiently for the signal to start

   arthur was in a dreamy mood and took
little note of surrounding objects he had
that same day landed in boston after a
long and stormy voyage and an absence
from home of two or three years

   images of home rose up before him one
 after another as he drew near and nearer
 and mingled rather distractingly with the
 reminiscences of his travels in another
 hemisphere and his calculations of profit
 and loss which might accrue from it for his
 had been a commercial enterprise

   but there were other thoughts and images
 which jostled all the rest into a corner and
 then combined with them to tantalize iris
 body with the vain hope of refreshing sleep

   a partnership in his fathers business
 was in immediate prospect and a home of
 his own and a wife such a wife too as
 - his would be so long as he had waited
 and so hard as he had striven to overcome
 one obstacle after another which had arisen
 to postpone the union if not absolutely to
 forbid it but which had been finally over-
 come no wonder that arthur willis could
 not sleep

   so dreamy indeed was he that he had


the railroad mans magazine

 scarcely noticed before die train started
 two other travelers who were sharing the
 car with him they took a seat directly be-
 hind in fact willis and the two strangers
 were the only passengers in die car

  when he did perceive diat he was not
alone the dim light from the oil-lamp in
the car roof told him little more than tliat
one of the other passengers was a middle-
aged man of respectable appearance and the
other a stout something in a bearskin coat
with a breatli not free from a strong suspi-
cion of ardent spirits which made close
contact anything but pleasant and more-
over with a rough grating voice

  williss ears were not altogether closed
against eaiuhly sounds and he caught up
insensibly some scraps of intelligence re-
lating to events which though common-
place enough at that particular time had a
tone of novelty

  he heard for instance of princely for-
tunes which had been run up in an incon-
ceivably short space of time in the stock
market of the mad excitement which had
attended the blowing up of a certain big
bubble of the tricks of knowing ones in
buying and selling out in starting illusory
schemes and making profitable merchandise
of human folly of the bursting of the bub-
ble and the ruin of hundreds who in
making haste to be rich had lost the sub-
stance for the shadow

   i dont like it-i never did like this
sort of wholesale gambling said one of
the passengers  they are scarcely to be
pitied who have got their fingfcrs well bitten
by putting them into the trap their fami-
lies to be sure will have to suffer-thats
the worst of it

  ah well mr smith retorted the man
with the loud voice and bearskin coat  i
cant say but what there has been a good
deal of knavery at the bottom of it all but
if people will be cheated let em i say
but i shouldnt have thought of hearing
you run down railroads however

   i dont run down railroads said the
other in a quiet tone  and i can only say
that i am thankful i have had so much to
do with their practical working as you
know as to leave me neither time nor in-
clination to play pitch-and-toss with them

  the train stopped at a lunch station and
mr smith left his place for a cup of coffee

    say said the wearer of the bearskin-
coat in a confidential tone suddenly lean-
ing forward and nudging arthurs back to

attract his attention  i say do you know
that gent  

  no sir replied arthur willis sleep-
ily

   ah  resumed the inmate of the bear-
skin drawing a long breath  a lucky fel-
low that why you must have heard of
smidi-alexander smith-the great rail-
way man 

  no i havent said arthur i have
been abroad a good while

   oh that accounts for it you will hear
about him then well thats smith ten
or a dozen years ago he was nothing but a
vermont mechanic but some lucky hit he
made about railroads gave him a lift now
they say hes worth no end of money you
should just go and look at his factory-
thats all

  oh said arthur willis and at the
same moment mr alexander smith re-
entered the car

  after all mr smith said the bear-
skinned traveler resuming the conversa-
tion there is some excitement though in
this gambling as you call it there was
some fun in it while it lasted at any ratex
if some lost others won and so tis about
square

  how many losers to one winner re-
plied mr smith rather sharply no sir
it isnt square nor anything like it and so
it will turn out in thetong run look at
the bankrupts reported in the newspapers

   ahu- responded the other  tilings are
out of square there at all events by the
way another of your nbbs is gone i see
whats-his-name of worthing street i
mean

  yes sir i am sorry for it two hun-
dred and fifty thousand dollars they say
and not twenty-five cents in the dollar nor
anything like it all gone in this mad
wild-goose chase after railway stocks and
yet it was done so secretly and the party
had such a reputation for wealth and
shrewdness too that a week ago it was
looked upon as one of the firmest houses in
new york

  there was something in the tone the con-
versation had taken which arrested the
young travelers attention

  the street mentioned was that in which
his fathers business was located and he
felt some curiosity to know which of his
neighbors was spoken of as mr whats-
his-name meanwhile the conversation
went on
the wealth of arthur willis



    terhaps you were let in there mr
 smith

    no sir not a penny was the answer
  i fancied you might said bearskin
 you said you were sorry

    well sir i suppose it is possible to be
 sorry for others as well as for ones self i
 am sorry too for these shocks that are given
 to commercial confidence it seems to be
 nowadays that everybody is suspected and
 as much mischief will be done that way as
 has already been done in another besides
 i am sorry for mr willis and his family
 for-

    excuse me sir interrupted arthur
 turning to face them but did you say that
 mr willis-

   arthur stopped short he could not
 frame the question that trembled on his lips
  it is of mr willis i was speaking sir
 replied mr smith mildly

    but not of-that is you do not mean
 that there is a-that there is anything
 wrong in mr williss affairs

    it is too well known by this time to be
 doubted you have heard that his name
 was in yesterdays newspapers and his
 place closed the common report is that
 mr willis has ruined himself by railway
 transactions and that he is heavily in-
 volved

    but not mr everard willis said
 arthur with increasing agitation which all
 his efforts could not subdue  some other
 person of the same name perhaps-not mr
 everard willis of worthing street there
 must be some mistake

   the reply he received precluded all pos-
 sibility of mistake

   thankful now for the dull light of the
 railway lamp the young man stunned
 and bewildered by the sudden and unex-
 pected intelligence of his fathers ruin
 sank-back again into his seat

   his day-dreams dispersed and in their
 stead came a confused and tangled web of
 gloomy forebodings

   shortly afterward the rough-coated man
 left the train and arthur became aware that
 he was undergoing the scrutinizing gaze of
 his only remaining companion before he
 could screen himself from this disagreeable
 examination the silence was broken

   i am not wrong i think said the gen-
 tleman called mr smith in believing that
 i address mr arthur willis

   i am arthur willis certainly replied
 the young man but you have the advan-

 tage of me sir i have never before had the
 pleasure of meeting mr smith i believe
  once before under different circum-
 stances but that is of no consequence now
 i have to apologize very sincerely i assure
 you for the pain i have unintentionally
 given i was not at all aware who was my
 traveling companion when i spoke of-

   it is of no consequence sir said ar-
thur  if what you say is true i must have
known it to-night and a few hours sooner
or later makes no difference

  again he relapsed into a silence from
which his fellow-traveler did not attempt
to rouse him until the shrill scream of the
engine gave note that the end of the journey
was reached then mr smith again spoke

  one word with you mr willis he
said  i am afraid you will find matters in
a bad state it seems strange to me that
you knew nothing of this before but at all
events i have been thinking i may be of
some little assistance to you if so here is
my card come and see me

  arthur mechanically took the offered
card and muttered an acknowledgment of
thanks for the proffered kindness in a
few minutes a cab was conveying him and
his luggage from the railway station to his
fathers house

  tell me jessy were almost the first
words lie uttered as his sister in tears of
mingled sorrow and gladness welcomed his
arrival is what i heard this night true
 arthur you have heard nothing too sor-
rowful to be true we are ruined

   father-what of him jessy 

  she shook her head mournfully

  the mad excitement of a few months
and its results had brought about an im-
becility of both mind and body painful to
witness

   you are our only hope now arthur
oh how glad i am that you are at home
arthur willis slept little that night in
the news which his sister had confirmed he
foresaw the downfall of all the hopes which
had so recently shed such a bright halo
about his future the partnership would
be a partnership in poverty and disgrace
the matrimonial engagement must end in
bitter disappointment

   i am sorry for you arthur said the
father of the young lady the next day when
arthur called on him at his counting-house
 i must say you have behaved honorably in
coming to me first but your own good sense
will tell you that the connection should be


the railroad mans magazine

dropped altogether you know that i did
not give my consent to it very willingly at
first and now-

  there needed nothing more than that em-
phatic now arthur returned home with a
broken heart

  his arrival however was very oppor-
tune he had a good standing among his
fathers creditors and it was known that
lie had had no share in the errors which had
brought about the failure

  his assistance was valuable in winding
up the heavy affairs of the bankruptcy
with straightforward and honorable frank-
ness he made his services available to the
utmost

   one evening while the settlement was yet
uncompleted and after the harassing duties
of the day were over he was slowly return-
ing from the office to his fathers residence
he was accosted by a gentleman whom he
dimly recognized as the companion of his
railway journey

   i have been expecting and hoping you
would take me at my word mr willis and
would have called on me before now but
as you have not i was just going to find
you are you disengaged if you are and
will allow me i will walk homewards with
you

  ardiur nodded his pleasure

   and now what are you doing how
are you getting on but i need scarcely
ask you this for everybody i meet speaks
in praise of your disinterested effort to
make the best of this disastrous affair
really to tell the truth i am not sorry you
have not been to see me before now

  what is the meaning of this thought
arthur he did not speak and presently
his home was reached

  now mr willis said mr smith
when they were alone may i ask what
you intend doing when these affairs are
finally settled

  arthur replied that he had formed no
plans for the future he supposed how-
ever that a mercantile situation might be
obtained

   your fathers business was a good one
i believe mr willis why not take it into
your own hands

  the interview was prolonged to a late
hour and the young man entered the room
in which his sister was waiting for him in
a more hopeful frame of mind than he had
enjoyed since his return home

  a few weeks passed away and then it

became known that arthur willis had re-
established the business which his father
had been compelled to relinquish with all
the advantages of an enlarged and profit-
able foreign trade

   he made no mystery of the fact that the
unsolicited assistance of mr smith had en-
abled him to take this step and when this
was explained all wonder ceased for the
large-hearted open-handed but sometimes
eccentric liberality of that gentleman was no
secret 

   nevertheless there was a mystery which
for months afterward remained uncleared

   you never saw mrs smith before do
you say mr willis it was in mr
smiths drawing-room that this fragment
of a conversation passed

   never before she did us the honor to
call the other day never at least that i
can remember

   look again mr willis are you quite
sure and this girl-laying his hand on
his eldest daughter have you never seen
her before

   arthur was puzzled by the tone of die
speaker he repeated the assurance that
if he had ever had that pleasure his memory
played him falsely

   perhaps you will refresh our friends
memory edith said mr smith to his wife

    do you not remember asked the lady
in a soft gentle voice  a dreadful storm
on a july night many years ago traveling
from boston on the coach a poor young
woman lightly clad with an infant in her
arms 

    yes yes i certainly remember that-
all that said arthur eagerly for the truth
at once flashed on his mind

   and the poor womans foolish alarm
and the harshness of the coach proprietor
who would have turned her out of the
coach and how it was that he did not
do it

   and that young womans husband mr
willis continued mr smith who told
you that he would find means of repaying
the kindness which was shown without ex-
pectation of reward or thanks have you
never happened to meet with him since in
your travels tell him edith what you
know about it

     am that poor woman she said

   the seed of a little kindness sown years
before had sprung up and borne this goodly
fruit the bread cast upon the waters had
returned after many days

no -the boys of the mississippi valley

chasing desperadoes in missouri -hero of a moving-picture drama-why
a pistol was borrowed-foleys length of service-

running a road on credit

n a chicago and alton train
in a forward day-coach
which was used as a
smoker sat nine pas-
sengers also one train-
man namely alec lew-
is the train had come from chicago and
toward evening was nearing st louis it
was a cold blustering january day

  the rear seat in the smoker was occu-
pied by a smooth-faced meek-looking man
who for hours had insisted upon keeping
his window open though the day was un-
usually cold

  trainman lewis sat down beside this
meek-looking individual in the rear seat
and said

  seems like youd catch cold with that
window open

  ive got to risk that replied uriah
heap

   and that there package of yours per-
sisted lewis  it must be valuable i
notice you never leave it out of your hands
you carried it with you even when you went
up forward to get a drink of water

  you bet its valuable exclaimed the
humble one

  you a bank messenger asked the in-
quisitive lewis

  no a butler ive been ten years with
one family in boston my master is a
very rich gentleman

   ah i see said lewis  you are car-

scrics began in june railroad man

 rying a valuable present for him to some
 one in st louis

   yes a present assented the butler
  a present of fifty thousand dollars in
 cash

   good heavens you mean to say there
 is fifty thousand dollars in cash in that
 package 

     i do

    your boss must be crazy why didnt
 he give you a check  

    he couldnt the present had to be in
 cash

   arent you afraid of being robbed
 maybe but im going to throw this
 money out of the car-window some time be-
 fore we reach st louis

   whats that throw fifty thousand
 dollars out of the window  

    yes i expect to toss it out any mo-
 ment now the wonder is that ive not
 been ordered to throw it out before this
  and is that why youve kept that win-
 dow open this cold day all the way down
 from chicago

   yes im talking too much i know
 but-youre not a detective are you no
 of course not youre a brakeman

   lewis had jumped up he now stared
 at the humble-looking man with an ex-
 pression of pity

   look here he said if youre a but-
 ler to a rich man youre a crazy but-
 ler to a crazy millionaire i say youre

the railroad mans magazine

both lunatics fact is however i believe
youre stringin me fifty thousand dol-
lars fifty thousand nothin you be-
long in a loony house you do

  but the meek-looking man merely
smiled indulgently as one would beam
upon a child who knoweth not whereof he
prattles

  trainman lewis left the man at the open
window and walked to the forward end of
the car the train was within sight of
east st louis just then one of the pas-
sengers in the middle of the car arose and
walked down the aisle till he came to the
man by the open window he leaned over
and said in a low tone

   when the whistle blows at the approach
to the eads bridge across the mississippi
-let her go

  just then two other men suddenly ap-
peared they threw themselves on the pas-
senger who had given the order to the but-
ler and one of them cried

  no use resisting tom brandt we
know all about your game-and youre
done for

  the speaker held both hands of the man
called tom brandt as in a vise till the
second man applied the handcuffs

  at the same time the whistle blew for
the railroad bridge across the mississippi
the butler fumbled with his package and
began lifting it toward the car-window
when one of the captors of tom brandt
cried

  no no keep that hold on to it
dont throw it out you must obey us
now im detective collins and this is
detective burt

  just then came the report of a pistol
detective collins fell senseless on the floor
with a wound in his head

  a second report rang out detective burt
staggered then clutched spasmodically at his
arm through which a bullet had passed

  the two shots were fired not by brandt
who was handcuffed but by another man in
die car-one who turned out to be  easy 
walker a pal of brandts

  not once had he spoken to brandt on the
ride down from chicago nor had the two
given any sign that they were acquainted
so the detectives were not aware that they
would have to deal with two men

  easy walker the man who had fired
the shots shouted to brandt come on
use your legs we must jump

  all this happened within sixty seconds

the drama was witnessed by trainman alec
lewis and the passengers in the smoker
lewis seeing die handcuffed man and the
one who had fired the shots both making
for the rear door with the evident intention
of jumping from the train pulled the bell-
cord desperately

  before the train had come to a stand-
still however the two desperadoes jumped
landed safely on their feet and began ma-
king a dash across a field

   chase em  cried burt the detective
who had been wounded in the arm address-
ing all in the smoker  get after those
men you fellows quick dont let em
get away 

  trainman lewis rushed from the car
leaped to the ground and passed the word
to the crowd of passengers who had piled
out of the train to learn the cause of the
sudden application of the air-brakes

  at least fifty of the passengers started in
pursuit of the two fugitives they formed
a posse led by trainman alec lewis

  lewis ran after the fleeing men the posse
keeping close at his heels they gradually
fell behind however till quite a distance
intervened between lewis and the passen-
gers

  as lewis neared the fugitives the one
who was handcuffed tom brandt managed
to pull a revolver and fire it his shot went
wild lewis did not even slacken his speed
just then alas the one who was not mana-
cled easy walker also pulled a gun
and let fly at lewis

  the trainman went down with an ugly
wound in his leg 

  the pursuing passengers rushed up to the
fallen trainman and all came to a dead stop
some bent over him and fastened handker-
chiefs around his leg to stop the bleeding

  then like a true hero of the battle-
field lewis said

  never mind me you confounded igno-
ramuses go on after those men if any
of you have guns let that man who shot me
have all the lead he can stand 

  electrified again into action by the train-
mans command the excited passengers start-
ed once more in pursuit of the fugitives
only to hear the leaders shout

  theyre caught look those men
building the fence one of em threw a
fence-rail at the handcuffed man catching
him square on the legs there the other
fence-builders are piled up on top of the
other runaway 
ten thousand miles by rail



  it was thus that the two fugitives tom
brandt and  easy  walker were at last
checked in their flight disarmed and held
captives by a dozen illinois farm-hands
who had been building a fence

  the two prisoners were hustled back to
the train by the posse while alec lewis was
made as comfortable as possible on the floor
of the baggage-car

  one of the two wounded detectives pro-
duced another pair of handcuffsand  easy 
walker was manacled the prisoners were
then chained together thrown into a seat
and guarded by a number of determined
men while the train rolled into east st
louis the three wounded men-train-
man lewis hero of the day and the two
detectives-were taken to the hospital while
the prisoners were led off by the police

  meantime the meek man who had told
lewis about the fifty thousand dollars anx-
iously inquired of the train-conductor what
time he could get a train from east st louis
that would carry him back to boston

  when the three wounded men were put to
bed side by side in the hospital trainman
lewis said

  will you two detectives kindly inform
me what this is all about

what am i all shot up like
this for anyway and
why are you two lying on
those cots down and
out 

  the story the detectives
told lewis was this

  the two desperadoes

tom brandt and easy

walker were members of
a gang who had kidnaped
eddie brathwaite son of
a millionaire of boston

the meek - looking man
who persisted in keeping
the car-window open on
that cold january day all
the way from chicago to
st louis was indeed mr

had been fixed for handing over the ran-
som the police intervened to prevent the
payment of the money

  at length the crooks wrote mr brath-
vvaite that if he wished to see his son
again and alive he must send a messenger
to st louis on a certain train with fifty
thousand dollars in cash the letter also
stated that a certain man would be on the
train with the messenger and would tell
him exactly when and where to toss the
money out of the car-window the crooks
added that one of their gang would be at
the spot indicated ready to pick up the
package when it was flung from the train

  with these demands mr brathwaite com-
plied saying nothing however to the au-
thorities for he preferred to part with fifty
thousand dollars rather than take any fur-
ther chance of hearing that his son had
been murdered as a result of his refusal to
pay the ransom nevertheless the police
discovered what was afoot

  but the kid exclaimed the trainman
when the detectives had finished their tale
have they got the kid

   yes one of the sleuths answered  ed-
die bradiwaite was found this morning with

brathwaite s butler and
his package really did con-
tain a full fifty thousand
dollars in yellow-backs

for two months the
crooks had been in secret
communication with mr

brathwaite regarding the
ransom but each time	  when the whistle blows at the approach to the

when an hour and place	bridge let her go

jim king the leader of the gang in a house
in chicago

  a week later the happy father of eddie
brathwaite divided a generous part of the
fifty thousand dollars as a reward among
the various detectives and others who had
found his son and captured the kidnapers

  trainman lewis before leaving the hos-
pital in east st louis received a letter
from mr brathwaite after reading it he
showed it to the two wounded detectives
after they had read it lewis said to them

   did i ever remark to you fellers that i
pronounced that butler and his boss both
crazy if i did i deny now emphatically
that either of em is- insane theyre both
as sane as i am and im near-crazy with
thinkin of the good deeds i can perform

the yazoo car-tagger

  on the way up from new orleans i
traversed the east bank of the father of
waters to memphis by the yazoo and
mississippi valley railroad thence up the
west bank to st louis by the mop
among the stories related by the  val-
ley railroaders were the following

  the car-tagger-in-chief of the yazoo
and mississippi valley railroad at vicks-
burg was george burdette one of the most
matter-of-fact of the railroad sons of the
father of waters burdette always con-
scientious and loyal to his road neverthe-
less was unfalteringly a doubting thomas
when it came to taking stock in stories
or plays or moving-pictures of railroad life

   i take no stock in such things because
nothing ever happens to a railroad employee
except an accident or a wreck

  no sir nothing outside the regular
performance of his duties ever gets coupled
onto him

  last sunday night he went on i
went to a moving-picture show along came
a film called a railroad melodrama in which
the villain tied a section-foreman to the
tracks and left him there to lie slaughtered
by the limited all just because the foreman
wouldnt let his beautiful daughter marry
the villain but the heroine the foremans
offspring came on a dead run and untied
her father in the nick of time

  now i allow that no such dinged non-
sense ever happens to a real railroad-man
i read stories of us in the magazines and i

dont guess such thrillers ever happen in real
railroad life neither thems just stories
oh im not so sure remonstrated
burdettes friend  you cant tell what
minute somethins goin to happen to one of
us to get a feller a loomin up as a hero in
a railroad story youre likely to get into
a thriller yourself any old time burdette
you aint immune

  what retorted burdette me a
car-tagger in a thriller not on your life
nothing thrilling ever happened to a car-
tagger in the history of the world

  a few nights later george burdette was
working overtime at his car-tagging it was
nearing ten oclock and nearly all the other
men of the vicksburg station and yards
were at the moving-picture shows in the
yards not a wheel was stirring not a sound
heard except the crunch of burdettes feet
on the cinder-path between the box cars

  suddenly four strong arms seized bur-
dette and a voice low but husky said

   dont cry out or youre a dead one 
burdette looking into the business end of
a six-shooter which gleamed in the moon-
light answered

  im no such fool as to yell this is
a hold-up is it well search me go
far as you like if you find any dough
on me keep it

   youre off the track said the man with
the gun while his pal held the car-taggers
arms pinioned behind him  we know you
burdette and we know you aint got no
money you never did have and never will
have as long as theres a moving-picture
show in town what we want is for you
to give us the combination of the safe in the
depot

   theres where youre off the track an-
swered burdette  i dont know the com-
bination if i did--id have to be dead
drunk to give it to you

  the two highwaymen with terrible oaths
then insisted that burdette did know the
combination they swore that burdette had
learned the new combination that very day

   know what well do to you if you re-
fuse to cough up the figures one of the
highwaymen added well lash you to the
track

   i do not know the combination per-
sisted burdette

  then youre as good as dead right now
just for not knowing was the verdict

  the desperadoes meant business too
they forced burdette up the track at the
ten thousand miles by rail



point of the six-shooter and stopped at a
spot just beyond a curve

   tie him here said one of the men
  what with asked the other

  the first man ran his hand over bur-
tlettes person  heres his belt he said
 tie one of his arms to the track with that
and heres his necktie use that to tie his
other arm

  the car-tagger struggled manfully but
the men with the guns lashed him to the
track just the same

 now said the leader of the highway-
men  the express from new orleans is due
along at ten-thirty-five-just twenty min-
utes from now any time within nineteen
minutes will be plenty for you to remember
that combination burdette when you do
just you yell out the figures and we will
come and set you free

  the men disappeared burdette lay there
helpless knowing that unless he complied
with the conditions nuned the north-bound
express would surely end his life

  ten minutes passed-and fifteen in jve
minutes more the express would come thun-
dering along and he would be ground to
pieces he heard the screech of a loco-
motive whistle

  in the desperate instinct of self-preser-
vation the car-tagger gave a terrifying yell
did he yell the figures of the combination
no he yelled just this one word

   help

  he could feel the vibration of the rails
under him the peculiar and terrorizing sound
advertising the swift approach of the ex-
press burdette calculated that the train
was not more than a mile away

whatever am de matter wif you boss
burdette looked up saw an aged negro
standing over him that black man looked
to the car-tagger like an angel from heaven

   here here he cried untie me
quick got a knife youll find one in
my trousers-pocket there now cut me
loose the trains almost to the curve now 
one stroke of the knife severed the belt
a second stroke freed the car-tagger from
the necktie that bound him he scrambled
to his feet and jumped to one side-just
as the express crashed by

  youve saved my life said burdette
to the negro what can i do for you
do you-ah happen to have a match
boss ahve got baccy and a pipe but
aint got no match what a whole box-
ful thank you boss

  the life-saver trudged on down the right-
of-way smoking like a chimney while
george burdette car-tagger of the yazoo
and mississippi valley trudged up the
right-of-way muttering

  well im blowed dont it beat all
that it should happen to me its the
limit

  burdette went back on his job and said
not a word to a living soul about his thrill-
ing experience

  two days later however he met the rail-
road friend to whom he had declared that
nothing ever happened to a car-tagger

   hear youre now taking stock in rail-
road ihelodrama such as you see on the
stage and in moving-pictures burdette
said the friend

  whats ailin you asked the car-tag-
ger refusing to look his friend squarely in
the eye

   hear youre takin- stock too in those
yarns printed in the magazines the friend
continued  that was a close shave you
had the other night it would make a real
good moving-picture-

  rot answered burdette

   that negro told us how he needed a
light for his pipe and got it continued
burdettes friend  say george are you-
all convinced that things sometimes do hap-
pen to railroad men in real life like they
do in stories  

  well drawled the car-tagger hesita-
tingly maybe just once in the life of a
man something may happen to him but
not twict no sir not twict im glad
that thing happened howsomever

   why  

  because-dont you see as such a
tiling never happens twict im now one of
those chaps the doctors call an immune

the borrowed pistol

  just after i pulled into baton rouge on
the yazoo and mississippi valley railroad
one of the boys of that line said

   hunt up  pinky  ross while youre in
this here louisiana capital and get him to
tell you the story of dan childress the
train newsboy

  ross of die yazoo

  no of the louisiana railway and
navigation company that line runs
through here you know this is their prin-
cipal station between new orleans and
shreveport


the railroad mans magazine

   pinky  ross a yardman whom i found
at the hostlers shanty plunged straightway
into his story

   its some powerful amazin suh how
train newsies will sometimes hike sudden
into a railroad drama ah reckon that you

 -n

port

wards progress suh

o that girl dan 

 some fond mr de loach yes
suh but all reckon ma fondness aint
all tied up only to that girl mr de
loach suh ahm powerful fond also
of the conductor of this vere train

 having made this confession dan
red in the face began shouting at the
top of his voice like a boy whistlin to

dont come too often by dramas wherein
newsboys figure but this time suh youre
up against dan childress a live one

   about three years ago dan was sweet
on a girl up at shreveport out of which
town he had a run on no  of the louisi-
ana navigation line somehow the girl
didnt seem to want to front up much with
dan

  one morning dan met the girl on his
way to his train

    ah reckon said he  that ahd be
powerful prideful if youd meet me at the
picture-show to-night will yer 

   go long dan the girl answered
 you-all is only a kid nope nixy pic-
ture-show you-all better find a young-
girl to tote round cause ahm some class
with the grown-ups

   crestfallen dan boarded his train for
the run south and began yellin in fierce
and mad tones

      all the latest magazines 

  the train pushed on southward till
pretty soon conductor de loach meets dan
and pats him on the shoulder fatherly-
like and says

   dan ma boy what progress you ma-

show lies none afraid of nothin in the
world

     all the latest magazines 

   dont you see suh dan childress liked
conductor de loach powerful much cause
de loach was always moughty kind to
that youngster dan was mostly alone in
the world and he kinder looked up to de
loach like he would to a father

  well suh as dan went down the aisle
shouting out liis wares the drama begins

   the train had pulled up at hagen sta-
tion suddenly dan hears a cry that sounds
like it conies from a man whos been hurt
dan recognizes the voice of conductor de
loach and turns in time to see a man on
the forward platform in the act of kicking
de loach offn the train

     hes stabbed the conductor  shouted
the passengers  that man drove a knife
into the conductor three times

   seeing de loach kicked from the plat-
form and hearing how he had been wound-
ed dan childress drops all his magazines
and starts up the aisle shouting

    got a pistol  whos got a pistol 
some one lend me a pistol 

  well suh a planter from shreveport
ten thousand miles by rail



who knew dan outs with a gun and hands
it over to the newsboy dan rushes out of
the car leaps to the ground and hot-foots
after the butcher who had stabbed de
loach

   past the station and up the right-of-
way dan runs pretty soon gettin close on
the more or less rheumatic fugitive and
crying 

  stop runnin you butcher stop or
ah down you with a bullet to em-
phasize his words dan fires a shot in the
air

  the butcher stopped in another mo-
ment dan had poked his pistol into the
mans face saying

     theres a calaboose in this town thats
goin to open its doors to you quick you
come along with me 

  and suh dan actually marched that
man at the point of his borrowed six-
shooter right up the main street of hagen
all the way to the jail

   that evening when dans train arrived
at shreveport the news of his exploit had
preceded him while the ambulance toted
conductor de loach to the hospital all the
railroaders swore dan was some hero even
strange men hailed him and said  put it
there  just like dan was a good many
years oldern seventeen

  and what do you think up walks
that girldan was sweet on and says to him

    dan childress ah reckon ahd be
powerful prideful to be seen with you-all
at the moving-picture show to-night ma
mind is shore some changed about you-all
bein only a kid

   in venice yesterday and st louis to-
day i exclaimed you must travel by
cable

  no sir you see sir my venice is
right here in the mississippi valley im
speaking of venice illinois

  well i said chuckling with him
 anything happen in venice illinois that
ought to get into print 

  no sir nothing nothing ever hap-
pens to railroaders in venice

  it was plain that my venetian friend had
a story to tell but as a tale-bearer he lacked
courage

  to encourage that venetian railroader
i told him the first story that came into my
head and by sheer accident it proved to
be just the right story to cause him to recol-
lect that something really did happen once
upon a time to a railroad man in venice
illinois

   your name is washington long and
youre a trainman i began

  yes my names wash

  well wash i know i cant scare you
off your job by any story so im going to
tell you how five trainmen all pals began
and ended their railroad careers in a time so
brief that the case is a record one

   i heard this story at roanoke vir-
ginia i went on  the five men in ques-
tion all went to work on the same day for
the norfolk and western railroad three as
passenger trainmen and two as freight
brakemen

   one morning a few days later four of
them walked into the general offices at ro-
anoke and asked for and received permis-
sion to lay off that afternoon to attend a
funeral

   three days later three of them again
appeared at the general offices and said they
wanted an afternoon off to take part in a
ceremony of last rites

   a week passed and two of them showed
up in the general offices and announced that
they wanted an afternoon off to pay final
tribute to a certain deceased

   another week passed and one of them
walked into the general offices this lone
man was the youngest of the five trainmen
his name was rob pollard in a weary
voice now he said hed like an afternoon
off to attend certain obsequies-

   the very next day rob pollard again
appeared at the general offices looking so
dejected that the train-master exclaimed
whats the matter pollard you look
as if youd lost your last friend

     i have answered pollard

    what another funeral  great scott
man youve already attended-no less than
four funerals this month

     no sir im not looking for a lay-off


the railroad mans magazine

for a funeral this tunc im here to resign
   resign why

    well sir you see theres too many
funerals in the railroad profession a
month ago i started to work here with four
of my best friends the whole four are
now lying in the cemetery one was killed
in a wreck a second by flying fragments of
a locomotive when she blew up a third fell
to his death from the top of a moving
freight and the fourth the one i buried
yesterday was run over and killed here in
the yards im the sole survivor ive come
to get my time sir im an electrician and
im going back to my trade

   but expostulated the train-master

 just because all your friends were killed is
no reason why it should be your turn next
 oh that aint it sir i aint afraid of
being killed that aint it what gets on
my nerves is these here frequent funerals i
just cant stand the expense for flowers
there i said to my venetian friend
at the conclusion of my story  can you
beat it for brevity of service

  beat it exclaimed the trainman from
venice illinois showing unutterable dis-
gust beat it i should say i could
you say that case at roanoke is a record
one holy smoke its about a million
miles away from the record fact is sir
your story aint got no right to beentered
into the running at all a whole month
holy smoke why thats just ages com-
pared to the period of time involved in the
case which im going to tell you about

  its the case of michael foley fifty
years old who started a railroad man for
the first time in his life at seven oclock one
morning last march

    it all happened in the yards at venice
illinois at five minutes before seven that
morning foley having been duly hired the
day before by the wabash railroad report-
ed for duty at the yardmasters office

  now foley said the yardmaster
youre a-flagman do you understand
heres a red flag you take it and go up
to the main street crossing and when you
see a train coming you wave that flag to
warn vehicles and folks afoot that theyre in
danger i tell you foley youre now a
member of the railway army youre a
private in the ranks but the safety of the
public depends upon you

   youre a standard-bearer do you un-
derstand youre a color-bearer your
duty is to stick to your duty no matter

what happens never you budge from your
station never desert your post never lower
that flag no matter who tries to divert you
from your duty and above all obey or-
ders obey em strict and to the letter

     yes sir i do sir im to stand pat
with this here red flag through thick and
thin and no matter who or what comes
along im to show that im planted and
have taken root and am growing up on this
crossing like a oak-tree

  at seven exactly foley took his post
at the crossing with his red flag

  five minutes later two men loomed up
at the door of the yardmasters office and
laid a heavy thing down on the door-step
whats that   asked the yardmaster
  a corpse the men replied

  whose is it

  dont you recognize the new flag-
man  

  recognize that no it looks like
it might have been a man once but i aint
sure hes some smashed aint he 
yes sir he was thrown some fifty
feet by southbound no 

  wait a minute said the yardmaster

 ill givehim his time he glanced at the
clock  five minutes and no overtime
he said  all right how did the deceased
meet his demise 

  well sir it looked to us-all mighty
like a case of suicide yes sir we-all say it
was a self-murder foley was standin
plumb on the track in front of that bur-
lington train waving his flag frantic-like
all round his head a driver of a lumber-
wagon and half a dozen pedestrians and a
lot of yardmen yelled to him to get off the
track but foley just wouldnt budge an
inch even the engineer waved his hand
from the cab as frantic as foley waved his
flag but foley stood pat-till he went
flyin through the air

   the yardmaster as he heard this
tugged nervously at his mustache and kept
muttering fool soldier idiot soldier

   finally when the yardmen had finished
their tale all the yardmaster said was

   take this dead soldier over to the
undertaker and tell him to inform the rela-
tives of foley that theres a sum of money
due them-the wages due the deceased at
the time of his demise

  well sir the sum of money due those
 heirs and assigns forever  was exactly
one cent-foley having worked overtime a
few moments
ten thousand

miles by rail



   and you never saw a man fuss about
anything the way that yardmaster at ven-
ice illinois still fusses about that penny
ever since foley was buried he has been
pesterin ltndertaker childman findin all
kinds of fault because the undertaker hasnt
found a single heir or assign forever it
looks like the yardmaster will have to keep
that cent all right and you cant
deny it that the worlds record for

place and over twenty of them informed the
conductor that they were broke and with-
out tickets

  all right the conductor said you
fellows keep tabs onyourselves till pay-
day

finally one evening toward the end of
the month when the thirty workmen board-
ed the train not one of them possessed
n either a ticket or the coin for a cash fare

 stop runnin  you butcher 
stop or ahll down you
with a bullet

 billy bryans tain

  when an illinois central train on the
carbondale-johnston city stopped one
evening at a town where a large manufac-
turing plant is located thirty-odd work-
men filed into die smoker when the con-
ductor came dirough at least ten of die
men announced that they possessed neither
tickets nor money

all right said the conductor you
fellows keep track of what you owe me

a few nights later the same thirty work-
men boarded the same train at the same

    all right  said the conductor  your
credit is good till pay-day

  on the evening of the first day of the
new month on arrival at carbondale the
conductor went in the auditors office and
turned in a sum of money somewhat in ex-
cess of seven hundred dollars

  whats this asked the auditor evin-
cing great surprise

   cash fares was the answer

   your cash fares for the day usually
amount to about fifteen dollars why sucli
a mightly lot of cash fares on this par-
ticular day 

   its pay-day down at that mill town
thats why for the last ten days a lot of
workmen down there didnt have any money
no sir not a cent did they have till to-day


the railroad maxs magazine

give me your mileage you
robber of poor railroads

but i let them ride- all the same every
evening

   what running a railroad on credit  
yes i had to let them ride on credit
in order to get that seven hundred dollars
if i had not let them ride on credit those
men would have walked and we would have
lost this bucketful of dough

   all right but next time let em walk
all the same on the first day of the fol-
lowing month that same conductor turned
in over eight hundred dollars representing
his cash-fare collections for a single day
though for thirty days before that he had
not turned in more than seventeen dollars
for the cash fares for any one day

  month after month he continued to turn
in an excessive sum on the day the mill-
hands at the manufacturing town were paid
off despite every command and demand
and threat and warning of the auditors and
other officials the conductor continued to
 run the railroad on credit

  that conductor was billy bryan and his
train was known to all the inhabitants of
the mississippi valley in illinois as  billy
bryans train

  i heard of billy bryan from eye-see
men and from men of the yazoo and mis-
sissippi valley day after day as long as i
remained in the valley of the father of
waters one railroad man after another
told me billy bryan was known personally
to nearly every man woman and child in
illinois that for over thirty years he had
run the same train from carbondale to
johnston city and return being on the job

daily from five in the morning till eight in
the evening

  billy bryans manner of running his
train was really unique

  billy would carry a man free as long as
he felt sure that the man was dead broke
but how he hated an impostor

  one day a certain passenger poured such
a dice tale of wo into the conductors ear
that billy carried that poor passenger free
that day and every few days after that for
three months

  then came a day when billy laid off to
go fishing the next morning when he
met the conductor who had taken his place
the day before billy said

   did a fat man with a black beard ride
with you yesterday a poor down-and-
out chap without money and without trans-
portation i hope you didnt put him off
the train did you

   i threatened to put him off when he
began telling me how poor he was replied
the conductor but inthe end he pro-
duced a mileage-book

  billy bryan gasped  you say he pro-
duced mileage oh well just wait till
he assembles with me once more

  the very next day the fat man with the
black beard boarded billy bryans train
and as usual said he had no ticket and no
money for cash fare

  give me your mileage you robber of
the poor railroads or ill throw you off this
train head first such was bills demand
and such bills threat

  the upshot of the matter was that the fat-
ten thousand

miles by rail



man with the black beard produced a mile-
age-book billy took it and proceeded to
pull out strip after strip of mileage as a
magician pulls strips of paper from a hat
when he had pulled out the last scrap of
mileage he handed the fat man the covers
saying

  there you owed me that for rides
youve had dont you ever try to ride on
my train again take some other train
because i wont carry you

  billy bryan was always most accommo-
dating to fishermen one day three men
bound on a fishing-trip boarded his train
and said

  billy wheres the place to fish to-day

  billy told them just where to go and
moreover stopped the train in the middle
of nowhere purposely to drop them

   ill be back here about six oclock this
evening he said to them and dont you
fellows keep me waiting here too long ill
hold the train here for you a reasonable
time but if you dont show up by six-
thirty or seven or seven-thirty or some-

where about that time ill pull on without
you

  billy bryan saved money and bought
farms and loaned cash on mortgages and
foreclosed the mortgages thus securing still
more farms till finally he became a man
of substance in  he was reputed to
be worth several hundred thousand dollars

  then suddenly to the consternation of
many it was learned that billy bryan had
resigned

  the eye-see authorities published a note
in a local illinois newspaper praising
billy bryan in most flattering terms and
adding that after thirty years of splendid
service for the road he had resigned in
order to devote all his time to looking after
his lands farms houses mortgages stocks
bonds and other forms of wealth which he
had amassed through industry 

  when i rode through the mississippi
valley in  billy bryan was living in
carbondale a man of leisure the train
which he had so long  conducted  is still
known as  billy bryans  train

the newsboy-what a lad he is for working

intent to keep on trying still-the newsboy

  and how he rises with the dawn when dawns
are gray and chill and trembles with an eager-

arise come piping far and shrill-the newsboy

your fire you rest you hear him calling calling
still with endless zeal and zest he comes and
goes without complaint and does his level best-

  he boards the car with elfish leaps as sparrows

lenient with him he drops off backward from the
step all light and safe and trim-the newsboy

  there is a moral in his ways for men sedate to
read a lesson that the wisest heads may profitably
heed he meets unflinchingly lifes test whereer
his ways may lead-the newsboy

speed indicators

a report current in the daily press says
 passenger-engines on the baltimore and
ohio are being equipped with speed indicators so
that engineers will have no excuse for exceeding
established limits

   attached to the device is a paper chart the
registry on which shows the speed on every point
of a division this goes to the superintendent
after a run is made and thus he has before him
daily a record of the speed at which trains are
run in his territory

  if this is true it will help the engineers espe-
cially if the idea is to get at the truth they will
welcome the installation of speed indicators as a
good thing the reason for this is that the indi-
cators will also show the delays along the line

  a locomotive engineer of our acquaintance used
to say that he got over the road better when the
general superintendents car was attached to the
flier for the simple reason that news of this fact
was quietly telegraphed ahead and every station-
agent became very quick and very alert when the

g	s was on hand and as for station baggage-
men you wouldnt knoy them they hit the
stopping point of the baggage-car door in a way
that was wonderful to see and in went the trunks
before you could say  jack robinson

  the train was a car heavier but the detentions
were light the indicators show delays that the
engineer is not responsible for yud the g s used
to wonder why it was not done that way every

    lo the long railway train winding and narrow
      over the trestle-work into the city

   coming too sure with the speed of an arrow
   on to its wreck without warning or pity
   moments seem passing the mastery of mortal-
   only a miracle retrieves the error

    thunders the bridge at its innermost portal
    increasing at d nearing and deepening in terror
    voices would reach to the gateway of heaven
    ere this wild roar by a cry could be riven

   even now steady now swift go as lightning
   nerving his arm with its mightiest force
   gigantic the sinews like iron thews tightening
   in driving the mad engine back on her course
   now answers the signal of danger already

   easier backward now safer and faster
   every soul blessing the courage so steady
   redeeming their awe-stricken lives from disaster

synopsis of previous chapters

john graham a young artist discovers among his dead fathers effects a diary which proves
that his former guardian a wealthy lawyer named simon dill has robbed himself and his mother
who has since died of a large fortune accruing from a gold-mine in which dill and graham
senior were once partners although engaged to agnes dill the lawyers daughter graham goes to
dills office presents his proofs and brands him as a criminal demanding the money which his father
has left him in trust dill finally pretends that he is about to make restitution but by a sudden
strategy fires his revolver grapples with his ward and when the police rush in hands graham over to
them as a robber and assassin he conceals the diary which is the sole proof of his own guilt it is
a case of one mans word against anothers dill who has dabbled in politics manages to have
graham prosecuted before a judge whom he put in office the -jlrtist is found guilty and sentenced
to five years imprisonment during grahams first month in the penitentiary he is visited by dill
who is anxious to learn the attitude of his former ward toward himself and find out whether he intends
to even up the score on his release he tells graham that he has placed the incriminating diary in a
safe-deposit vault and tries to draw him out but as graham refuses to utter a single word he goes
away unrewarded the prisoner chafes at the monotony of his existence and his sense of justice cries
out at the cruelties which he sees being practised about him and learns of from his cell-mate piano
who proves to be very much of a philosopher piano finally escapes leaving graham to bear his
misery alone after four years of imprisonment graham is finally given his liberty as he leaves
the penitentiary he is accosted by a stranger whom he soon discovers to be piano his former cell-
mate in disguise

his life felt so strongly as just this minute
the necessity for comradeship for some one
to rely on a little till things should begin
to readjust themselves he said nothing
but like a man in a dream walked on and
on beside his former cellmate

  thus they reached the square mounted
the steps and took a boston-bound train
piano steered him into a far corner of the
all but deserted smoker where they would
be free from annoying observation he
produced cigars and for the first time in
more than four eternal years graham tasted
good tobacco the contrast between his
accustomed  state as prison - weed is
called and real cuban leaf filled him with
an almost childish content for these first
few minutes out in the world again he was
as a child to its multitudinous ways

 all the way over the bridge graham
looked with curious eyes at the great busy

 a decision

ight  answered the other smi-
ling  i see youve got better
vision and memory than all
the  flatties  and  elbows 
put together why theyve
been congratulating them-
selves on my death for over a year - my
death and burial-oh yes he lowered
his voice  but come along he added
 bad climate around here very again
he urged graham forward

  for a moment graham thought of resist-
ing of trying to get clear from piano but
after all why should he piano had be-
friended him in quod he had taught him
many valuable lessons he had been a
pleasant companion graham had never in


the railroad mans magazine

rushing traffic the center of life and noisy
activities which seemed as strange to him
almost as though he had just landed from
another planet his companion offered no
remarks save platitudes he well under-
stood the confusion in the young mans
brain and understanding he waited

  the train turned slowed and stopped at
the north station

  well where are you heading for
asked piano  anything in view  

  new york to-morrow answered gra-
ham  how things are going to turn i dont
know but i suppose id better get back
ive still got a little money on deposit there
-enough to last for a while till i can get
my bearings why  

   oh just a natural interest thats all
but how about to-day to-night 

  well i might as well see barnard i
suppose get a loan from him and some
decent clothes then a hotel a good scrub
a sleep perhaps by to-morrow things wont
seem so-so kind of unnatural

   youll be all right in a day or two but
-take my advice-steer shy of barnard for
the present

  why so asked graham surprised as
the train pulled out and dipped toward the
subway

   do you want the papers to get hold of
this run items about you and all wait
in a week itll be stale they wont give it a
line if you need money its yours all
you want here

  from his inside pocket he produced a
bill-fold

no no objected graham i cant
do that thank you ever so much but-
piano merely laughed as he drew a fifty
from among several others of the same de-
nomination and slid it into grahams pocket

  no nonsense now commanded he
not a word of drip or rubbish between
you and me get fixed up right dodge
people for a while above all dont talk
inside of a week the world will look quite
differendy to you from what it does now
believe me i know

  graham kept silent he felt curiously
uneasy in company with this odd wise ex-
perienced man who in so many ways knew
such infinitudes of things whereof he him-
self was ignorant the train slowed for
milk street

  piano stood up

  well said he heres where ive got
to leave you what hotel  

  graham named the place he had in mind
the greenwald

   all right eight oclock to - night
sharp answered piano assuming an ap-
pointment before graham had had time
to formulate any reply piano had reached
the side door the train stopped piano
waved a friendly hand and was gone

  graham left alone frowned and bit his
lip then he remembered the fifty in his
pocket but he had little time for thought
for at boylston street he too got out a
minute later feeling lost and small in the
shoving tide of humanity he was wandering
down washington street in quest of clodies

  i guess ill have to use pianos money
after all diought he  one thing i wont
do and that is-spend the five they gave
me over there im going to frame that for
a souvenir some day

  eight oclock found graham in a dollar
room at the greenwald his impulse to in-
dulge in greater luxury he had repressed
every penny now he knew must do full
duty till he could make a fresh start

  when piano knocked graham was stand-
ing at the open window looking down into
the noisy crowded street wondering that all
this life had been going on just the same as
ever during the long blank years since he
had seen it last

  the air was heavy with tobacco-smoke
which the night breeze as it gently swayed
the curtain could only with difficulty dilute
graham was in his shirt-sleeves-a tall
somewhat slim figure pale and wan yet
still erect and with a brave way of holding
the chin well up not beaten yet john
graham

  piano gave him a firm strong hand on
entering laid his felt hat on the newspapers
drew up a chair sat down and keenly ob-
served the change that a few hours had al-
ready wrought

  almost yourself again eh said he
biting the tip from a cigar  a week from
now the almost will be a quite well

  graham did not answer at once but sat
down too and looked at piano

    id like to think so he replied at last
do you know ive-ive been thinking-
a lot

  dont exclaimed piano oracularly
 time enough later for now let things
drift

  graham shook his head

  no he returned to be out in the
the steeled conscience



world again means that the old thoughts the
old bitterness everything - its all come
back

  piano studied him a minute then smiled
slightly

   you mean the way you were jobbed 
thats bothering you

  wouldnt it bother you if youd- he
checked himself

  the other nodded well some said
he  i might as well tell you first off that
im wise oh yes i know even though
youve never seen fit to give me the whole
story these things get around in the un-
derworld you understand no matter about
that the point is whats next thats the
question sure as guns 

  graham wearily sighed  god knows 
he ejaculated

   perhaps perhaps not coming down
from theory to practise what do you think
of this 

  slowly he took from his pocket some
memoranda he sorted these over selected
a sheet of paper and handed it to graham
it read

  security storage warehouse company

 spring street new york city-

   simon dill depositor one sealed packet

   july  

  nothing but that just those few words
yet graham reading them leaned forward
crumpling the paper in his hand his eyes
stared his jaw dropped

  w-w-w-what he gasped

  piano laughed not too bad eh
said he with amusement

   but-why-how on earth- cried gra-
ham starting from his chair every muscle
tense  how-

  the other waved a graceful hand

   a mere trifle answered lie  ive had
that for more than a year been keeping it
for you your affair not mine i wasnt
going after it besides ive had other things
to do so now you see were back where
we were a minute ago when i asked you
what next  

  for a minute graham could find no an-
swer he stood there dumb-stricken void
of any coherent thought his mind a whirl
in his shaking hand the paper crackled
piano regarded him with a quizzical
amused expression

  come switch said he sit down and
keep your new linen shirt on no dramatics
now if you please that sort of things

superfluous between us squat well talk
things over

  graham sat down again breathing heav-

iy-

   you mean that you - i - that theres
any way-

  somewhat so its yours two things
stand between you and it one the law
two a certain definite quantity of stone
brick cement and steel a simple problem
in mechanics are you on  

   but suppose the case were all reopened 
revised and justice justice- the
courts-an appeal-

  piano had to laugh  you mean asked
he as a schoolmaster might interrogate a
child  you mean to sit there and put such
punk to me after all the reading and
thinking after all the knowledge youve got
all the first-hand experience youve had
with courts come out of it come come 
graham hung his head abashed

  youre right said he at last a little
recovered from his first strong emotion

  right of course money rules you
get that package get the stuff and the book
you see and youll be fixed every way
everywhere otherwise youll be in bad as
long as you live no way to square things
but just that think it all over when
youve thought-well you can always find
me or get news of me at this address

  he penciled a number one hundred and
sixth street new york city on a card and
laid the card on the table

  now said lie rising  im off theres
a little matter waiting for me down-town
its all up to you the fifty oh im not
bothering about that it came easy

  he took his hat

 hold on cried graham you-
surely you arent going yet why i havent
heard anything what room in the-ware-
house-or-

  time enough for that later answered
piano with a quiet smile  i leave for
gotham on the midnight ta-ta 

  then while graham still protested he
nodded amiably and departed john heard
his step die out on the cheap red carpet in
the hall

  when he was gone graham sat down
buried his head in his hands and as on
the first night he spent in jail he thought
and thought and thought

  with his bed unslept in he finally quitted
the hotel at about a quarter past eleven and
walked down to the south station


the railroad maxs magazine

  when the heavy express rolled out of the
train-shed two men sat alone together in the
smoking compartment of one of the pull-
mans one of these men wds shrewd and
middle-aged and quiet the other dressed in
a very new suit was young slim and con-
spicuously pale both had plenty of cigars
as the train pulled away from back bay
and settled into its stride through the night
for the run to providence they too settled
down as for a long long talk

chapter xiii

en route

 ow that youve made up your mind to
 join us said piano blowing a
cloud  now that youve sized up the whole
situation seen the ease of  disappearing 
from vour friends for a while why its nat-
urally up to me to give you a little more
insight into things but first of all-

   youre set then interrupted graham
 dead set against doing the thing for me
on any terms whatever

  piano laughed with an irony that brought
a temporary flush to the others face  i
may be overfond of the legal tender
switch he answered but as for hiring
out on another mans job-no not much
what you wouldnt incite to violence
would you or put wrong notions into an
innocent head no no - nothing doing
switch your quarrel notmine if you
arent man enough to take your own then i
wash my hands of you once for all now
and forever thats the prime requisite in
our world-nerve is whatever else we may
or may not be we have to be men

  graham hung his head ashamed  i
guess you dont need to say any more he
answered  i apologize only you know
the idea of-of-

  forget it youve got too much brain
and sand for me to have to point out the
obvious any longer before we go a bit
fartheris it yes or no just that

  yes so help me exclaimed graham
fully won over at last in his eyes shone
the strange light that dill had seen there
only now more strong more clear he held
out his hand

  piano took it in a silent clasp the two
men so unlike regarded each other nar-
rowly

   youll do said piano at last  i know
the breed it isnt because johnny yegg

has a memory ten million miles long and
never fails to invite a snitcher to a cold-
meat party-it isnt because of that i trust
you now i understand you maybe better
than you understand yourself youre the
goods 

  beneath his speech back of his look a
less fundamentally honest man than gra-
ham might have detected something not quite
sincere something that hinted almost at
some veiled ulterior motive but this gra-
ham did not see he only looked steadily
at his companion with a strange intent ex-
pression on his face for a minute there
was silence between them as the train fast
gathering speed swayed clattering over
switch-points and drummed on on into the
night

  the goods yes or im a parson re-
peated piano  youll need every ounce of
nerve youve got and then some before
youre through

   will it be - extremely dangerous  
graham asked

  that depends on how you go about it
depends on the personal equation take
me for example ive  fallen  more than
the average simply because i once in a
while let my temper run away with me and
try to grab everything in sight another
man more moderate might never get in
bad average things up and i dont sup-
pose that  crushing  is much more perilous
than any business especially as our motto
is  stick and slug  and the flatties know
it

   you mean theyre afraid of - of -
hesitated graham loath to speak the word
 cracksmen

   scared stiff on the whole smiled
piano  afraid to tackle us for the most
part let alone pushing a case theyd
rather give us a  shake-down  or run in
push-cart men who havent got a license
its safer-lots if it werent for  rats
theyd make a mighty poor show at settling
johnny yegg look how chief wilkie
himself back in  begged congress for
a whacking stool - pigeon fund i guess
that shows something all right look at
this too

  he h-ynded graham a clipping neatly
pasted on yellow paper graham read

  dctcctive clifton r wooldridge of the
  chicago force says it is to be regretted that
  every chief of police has not at his disposal a
  goodliberal secret-servicc fund from which he
  could pay for information regarding this class
the steeled conscience



  of criminals of coursc such information
  can come only from some one in close touch
  with them and my notion is that a good
  stool-pigeon of this kind is a source of valu-
  able information and should be well paid for
  his services never pay a pigeon until he de-
  livers the goods and then you are certain he
  will not  throw  you

  pretty much of an admission eh
said piano as for the pigeons once we
spot em - well we clip their wings all
right enough were a close-hanging hard-
hitting crowd sure as guns rest easy old
man youve got less to worry over than
the average bank-clerk

   oh it wasnt that i was thinking about
anyhow answered graham  what oc-
curred to me was this here i am green as
paint stacking into a game thats one of the
hardest and most skilful and brainy of any
in the world now then how-

   i understand why of course switch
you cant graduate with a degree of past-
master peterman in one night or ten but
with your delicate ear and clever fingers
your superior education it wont take you
long i give you the chance to join the
swellest  mob  on earth no need for you
to start as a  gay-cat  with fake sores made
by creosote begging with a package of
cards or  duckets as we call them to spy
out the marks

  no need for you to work into a shinny-
mark gang of rough - necks that dub
around podunk post-offices and work with
tools weeded from a blacksmith-shop that
use old tin lanterns and iron sledge-ham-
mers and that dont know any better way
than to rip a box to pieces the sort that
make their get-away on a hand-car and
think themselves rolling in the lap of for-
tune if they split a bundle consisting of
stamps bad checks a pail of false teeth
and a money-order book it isnt that sort
of a deal youre going to get no not by
a big brown jugful

   hardly switch youre going to travel
with a mighty good imitation of scientists
youre going to find out all about a kind
of soup that comes in rubber bottles and
that makes the hardest tool-chest look like
cheese youre going to put your electrical
knowledge to the slickest use you ever
dreamed of and to see neat work neat
beautiful

  graham drew at his cigar it had gone
out but he failed to notice it piano struck
a match for him

   you i suppose said graham when
the smoke was curling again you had to
-to begin in the-what you call the old-
fashioned way  

   partly so when i was serving my
apprenticeship most of the new scientific
methods were unknown as yet but from
the very first i had the advantage of know-
ing all about safes and vaults id built so
many you see yes and opened so many
too in cases where the owners had lost the
combination that helped a lot

  then besides i fell in with max shin-
burn almost at the start max is retired
now it was max you know that invented
nearly all the light modern tools-though
he never got a patent or a royalty on any of
em mores the pity i suppose nobody
ever lived who could beat him on die job
and nerve he was a marvel

  go on said graham eagerly listening
 just as an example that time after the
forty-thousand-dollar break at whitehaven
pennsylvania he got  dropped you re-
member no i forgot that all this is new
to you its a b c to me you see they
kept him in a hotel overnight at white-
haven handcuffed to a fly cop he was
and sleeping in the same bed with him in
a room off one where the general super of
the agency slept the super had taken the
clothes of both men and locked them in a
closet in his own room the bracelets were
 ratchets the safest out not much show
for a get-away there you say

  listen max smuggled the nib of a
steel pen between his fingers and a second
before they locked the bracelets he dropped
the nib into the ratchet that tiny bit of
steel blocked the bolt even though the
wrister seemed to be safe about midnight
max opened the cuff crept out reached
the hall went into a guests room grabbed
off a full outfit of clothes dressed and
vamoosed thats going some eh  
graham whistled	s

  right after that continued piano i
helped him on what was my first big crush
the ocean bank break in new york -our
mob cleaned up a bit over a million i was
in with him on the manhattan savings
bank job too that came to two million
seven hundred thousand in cash and bonds
i remember our whole kit was packed in
one small handbag nearly everything his
own invention the swag though-it took
us all to stow and carry it

    he and i lit out for belgium after that


the railroad mans magazine

there wasnt any extradition treaty then
it was a lead-pipe we didnt do much for
a while but finally we both got uneasy
funny how hard it is to loaf once you un-
derstand die business even though youve
got plenty of scads we piped things off
and finally tackled die provincial bank of
yiveres got in bad too five years for
max ten for me-the longest bit i ever did
-and all for a mere tiny trifle it just
shows you the value of looking out for de-
tails thats all

  piano direw away his cigar and took a
fresh one his face had grown quite seri-
ous graham looked at him with wonder

   what happened   asked he

  ill just tell you this and then well
turn in answered piano  lots to do to-
morrow no use rag-chewing all night
but the way we  broke our legs  over that
tendi-rate job is really worth hearing even
tiiough its humiliating to think about

  how so

   this way the building was a cinch
we got in like childs-play through a back
door by unscrewing an old-fashioned lock
max set the lock aside to replace it later
and put the screws in his vest-pocket i
took my shoes off and set diem in the bank
yard well we inspected the vault-for we
were only on a sort of preliminary expedi-
tion anyway - left the building and re-
placed the lock one of the screws was
missing we hunted everywhere for it
but couldnt find it good reason it was
stuck to a piece of wax in shinburns pocket

  while we were hunting a patrolling
gendarme found my shoes he whistled
for help we didnt dare to run and both
got  dropped max explained everything
-he could talk french like a frenchman
-and soothed things down they were
just going to let us go when a watchman
reported that one of the screws of the lock
was missing they searched us then oh
yes we found out where the screw was all
right enough so did they you know the
rest

  you had some time for reflection all
right commented graham

  oh just a little but i learned french
myself so it wasnt all wasted i learned
too that no detail is too small to overlook
i partly mastered my temper as well yes
ive been in  stive  since then but not for
long these american mouse - traps are
cinches but a french bastilc-thats dif-
ferent

   only for my getting mad so easily and
sometimes overreaching for the spon id be
safe enough those are faults you wont
have to contend with ive always fought
em but i havent always won out an-
other thing ive fought-and you must too
if ever you get ditched again is being
 mugged  and bertilloned i dont believe
a pen in this country has got a really accur-
ate set of my measurements or a decent por-
trait as for my finger-prints i change
diose once in a while

  he held out his hands palm up gra-
ham saw that the tips of the fingers had
been cross-hatched with fine cuts blurring
and destroying the telltale marks of identi-
fication

  a few new scars now and then re-
marked piano casually  will go a long
way toward putting the bulls into a barren
pasture just a practical point or two you
see in case you ever need any-which i
sincerely hopeyou wont

  thank you said graham not wholly
at ease the look in pianos curious eye
was a trifle disconcerting as was also the
obvious gusto with which once started he
talked about his exploits graham felt re-
lieved when a hand turned the door of the
smoking compartment and a mahogany
face surmounted by a porters cap peered
in

  half pas one gemmen announced an
african voice  ef yo gemmens wantin
to go to baid yor baids is fixed

  all right answered piano well
be ready in a couple of minutes then to
graham

   you take my word for it old man steels
a mighty unsafe thing to put money into
its bound to break sure before were much
older ive followed the market long enough
to know security storage stocks not
much better theres a sensational drop
pretty nearly due to arrive sure as guns
mark that

  the porter withdrew murmuring com-
plaints about the hours and habits of bro-
kers in general and his two late passengers
in particular

   come on switch said die cracksman
 if i keep on talking ill never come to an
end so i might as well quit now as later
its time we both were pounding the ear
otherwise youll be dopy when we reach
civilization and that wont do at all youll
need all the nerve and balance youve got
or can develop before long come on 
the steeled conscience



  both men turned in but long after piano
was contentedly dreaming graham lay
wide-eyed in the darkness of his berth-
which somehow reminded him terribly of a
prison-bunk-listening to the stuffy night
sounds in the sleeper the swish-swish of
the curtains and the clattering music of the
wheels upon the metal he was thinking
too of all that he had heard wondering
feverishly about all that for weal or wo the
future held for him

chapter xiv

the  swell mob

tt may seem strange pausing now  the
- threshold of grahams new life that
the man should have needed so much hard
experience of present-day law and order
so much thought reading and persuasion
before abandoning once for all the meth-
ods of conventionality before definitely
throwing in his lot with the only men who
could now help him win his own yet you
must remember that graham was no ordi-
nary fellow of vague or formless prin-
ciples that all his life he had been trained
to believe had been nurtured all through
his boyhood all through his college days
as is the custom of colleges in the faith
that the bases of society are just and that
abstract principles of right determine the
actual working-out of the worlds problems

  hence it was that even at the very last
moment he still hesitated beating about for
some hand-hold of belief some footing of
hope that there perhaps might be some
other way only when he had come to see
that nothing else remained save to make a
law unto himself to reverse by personal
action the verdict rendered through perjury
and guile-only then with a clear con-
science did he face his own soul and real-
ize that if right were ever to be his it must
come through what the world calls wrong

  in company with piano who advised him
now to let his heard and mustache grow
for greater safety he met next morning
two members of the mob in which he
had at last decided to enlist himself as an
apprentice he had once read in a highlv-
colored magazine article a description of
a yeggmans dump or hang-out this
had led him to expect perhaps some disor-
derly den on the east side in an attic or
cellar-a dark room littered with tools
empty bottles begging-cards and cigar-
 rr

butts the walls hung with ragged clothes
the air foul and dank it came rather as a
surprise then when piano ushered him
into well-kept bachelor apartments reached
by an elevator on the fifth floor of a house
in one hundred and sixth street not many
doors west of the park

   welcome to our home sweet home
said piano hospitably closing the outer
door behind them he whistled softly a
step sounded in the hall graham turned
toward him he saw advancing a tall erect
fine-looking -man with a thoughtful and
deep-lined face-a man whose forehead
high and intellectual whose beard parted
in the middle and brushed away sharply
toward either side gave him the air of a
respected and substantial banker broker or
merchant

   heres switch at last said piano
with a smile  switch shake hands with
adam youll get on famously together i
know even though you may not always
agree on matters of theory dont argue
with adam whatever you do he added
jestingly to graham  i warn you now
there isnt one of us can floor him on logic

   the older man gave no heed to this sally
but extended a fine and strong hand to
graham

    im glad to see you said he quite sim-
ply with a nicked german accent here
i take your hat so he waved toward
the room at the front end of the hallway

  piano led the newcomer thither gra-
ham found himself in a comfortable sitting-
room his first glance showed him book-
cases a morris-chair or two a table cov-
ered with magazines and papers in one
of the chairs another man was sitting smok-
ing a long-stemmed tasselled pipe the
man rose to greet him

  as again introduced by piano graham
shook hands with tumbler he noted the
mans trim side-whiskers somewhat bald
head and well-moulded mouth

  sit down said tumbler pleasantly
though with a sharp and steady look he
indicated a chair then shoved a box of
cigars toward graham who to relieve the
embarrassment that had got hold on him
took one and lighted it he sat down
crossed his legs looked from one to the
other of the men and-finding nothing per-
tinent to say-said nothing

  but his self-consciousness lasted not a
minute if he expected to be quizzed or
put through any course of prouts pleasant


the railroad mans magazine

disappointment came at once adam looked
in through the door just long enough to ex-
cuse himself on the ground that he couldnt
leave a little experiment he was carrying on
at the back of the flat and withdrew

  piano and tumbler fell into an easy
conversation about the base-ball pennant
prospects then drifted from that to the state
of the market and so to the subject of high
prices graham found himself presently-
taking a third hand in the talk just as he
would have done with any other men of
equal culture half an hour passed and
the air of the room was gray before so much
as any mention of  shop  came up

  by the way wheres dave asked
piano glancing at his watch  here it
is almost eleven i thought hed be here
before now

  dave answered the other dropping
into the curious lingo whereof graham had
already heard a little from piano  oh
hes out after a little dooley-for to-night
you know had to go across to jersey for
it to donahues he said he was going to
fix things with a gager over there too
mandelbaum i think he said the name was
powells getting a bit risky since the front
office bulls butted in there last week

  thats right too assented piano as
he pocketed his watch again  some gabby
or other must have been bawling maybe
well find out who and hand him one yet
before were done well-no use worrying
about that got the route laid out drags
mapped bait planted and all  

  tumbler nodded opened a drawer in his
table and took out a note-book and a road-
map of southern connecticut the map he
spread upon the floor he drew from his
pocket a gold-mounted fountain-pen and
traced a line irregularly from new york
city to southbridge

  this said he judicially is the best
we can do taking everything into considera-
tion state of the roads various town ordi-
nances about speed and so forth he
turned to graham perhaps you dont
quite understand everything as yet he ex-
plained

  a drag thats what we call a street
you know and planting the bait means
getting a line on the building the gopher-
the safe i mean-the watchmen and all
that sort of thing were going to take a
run out to-night in the machine pianos
told you no well no matter you
just keep your lamps lit and by to-morrow

youll be a whole lot wiser than you are
to-day

  he slid from the chair knelt and studied
the map with scrupulous attention gra-
ham an idea occurring to him turned and
looked at piano with raised eyebrows
 he-he knows about my case   whis-
pered he

  piano shook his head  only me he
answered tapping his breast then he
touched his lips graham saw again the
curious subtle look in pianos eyes he
wondered vaguely what interest the man
could have after all in thus taking on as
a member of the mob in thus imitating
him but though the thought gave him a
moments uneasy reflection he put it away
whatever the motive come what might
here he was that much was certain any-
how he stood at last on the first round
of the ladder of achievement of revindi-
cation nothing else mattered much too
late now for any hesitation any notion of
withdrawal he looked while tumblers
pen indicated an ink-marked spot on the
map

   here she is said tumbler reflectively
we go in at the east end of the town by
way of hotchkiss street cross the rail-
road take the second stem to the left
leave the machine back of the baptist
church then all we have to do is go
west one block take the alley running from
high to wilson and-get busy a pipe
by half-past one we ought to be out of
town again and making things buzz for
home eh  

  he looked up with a smile about to-
morrow morning he added  the south-
bridge national bank people and the bulls
and  pencils -the reporters you know-
will be having something to speculate about
maybe therell be a few thankful bank-
officers at that it happens more than
once he explained as in answer to gra-
hams surprised look  that a man short in
his accounts welcomes us like we were an-
gels of glory welcomes us why dont
you remember that east warwick mark we
were tipped off to by the cashier he asked
piano

  saved him from stripes all right as
for us-well we got all that was left any-
how little as it was banks you know
turning to graham are put up the flue
about ten times by the men inside to once
by us

  then as grahams eyes widened turn-
the steeled conscience

io

bier laughed oh thats only one of the
ten thousand things youve still to learn
about the world as it is not as most people
think it is 

  they talked till lunch-time laying out
all the details of the expected raid gra-
ham of course listened much and said
little but what he said betrayed a quick
perception and so ready an understanding
that both piano and tumbler now and
then paused to look at him and nod approv-
ingly at the meal served in right decent
style in the dining-room by an old close-
lipped mail whom the new-comer spotted at
once as having done time adam thawed
out and became argumentative he tried
to start a discussion of the tariff but no-
body venturing to oppose him had to drop
it for very lack of antagonism

  the conversation swung round to shop-
talk after a while interspersed with an
astonishing profusion of monicas or
nicknames in the profession of technicali-
ties and all but incomprehensible expres-
sions but graham sat tight kept his ears
open and-what with the use of his brains
what with the occasional explanation that
came his way-began already to feel him-
self less a stranger to their thought and life
than when he had entered the flat

  toward three oclock that afternoon dave
came in he was a short muscular fellow
beardless and brown-eyed his appear-
ance suggested that of a well-to-do young
business man he outlined what he had
that morning done the arrangements he
had made with mandelbaum the fence
or  phony-broker who he said would
dispose at a fair rate for them of any nego-
tiable bonds or papers captured in the forth-
coming crush

  you understand of course piano ex-
plained to switch that we can push out
cash or stamps ourselves but when it conies
to paper then we have to be careful a
first-class phony-broker is one of the most
important things we -have to look out for
its a dangerous stunt that sort of thing
we had a man once who got caught with a
bundle of railroad stocks

  they got him bang to rights and would
have shoved him only hed already taken
the precaution of putting the stocks on the
sidewalk and stepping on them with a mud-
dy boot so of course when he swore hed
found them they couldnt prove he hadnt
yes naturally we lost the stuff but then
the broker saved his skin which was some-

thing see the value of detail its just
what i told you before-perpetual vigil-
ance and so forth thats a dodge worth
knowing in a pinch that muddy boot
racket is

  the others laughed at the reminiscence
switch stowed that information away with
all the rest he remembered too the rather
startling sight they showed him in the little
kitchen-a pan of hot water steaming on
the gas-stove with half a dozen yellow
sticks of dynamite lying at the bottom
dynamite which dave had brought from
jersey city where he had purchased it from
his contractor friend donahue

   thats the way we make our  soup 
or  grease  or  sap  or  oil whichever you
want to call it dave explained  only
the low-class  gopherman  still uses pow-
der or  sawdust -dynamite with nerve
enough to do it right anybody can soak
the stuff pour off the water and collect
the nitroglycerine of course if it gets
too hot or anything happens-good-by but
thats-part of the job not to let anything
happen see here now

  while graham watched him a trifle ner-
vously he took up the tin and decanted the
water into the sink very skilfully he did
it leaving a yellowish liquid at the bot-
tom

    see that  he added with nonchalance
well if anything should just happen to
make that let go i guess pieces of this
kitchen would land somewhere over at col-
lege point maybe jamaica oh it would
make the boss noise all right enough but
you see weve got accidents guarded against
like this

  he set the pan down took a rubber flask
from a cupboard and with a marvelously
steady hand poured the deadly liquid into
it this done he corked the flask with a
rubber stopper and set it back on the shelf

    i love my roast beef but oh you soup 
he laughed and piano joined him as did
tumbler who stood looking through the
door as unconcernedly as though the nitro
had been so much coffee

  that night at half-past nine piano
called up the union garage and ordered
the machine sent round

  it certainly looks good to muh he
remarked casting an eye out the window
at the dark and cloudy sky if it conies
on to rain so much the better most mobs
only do their plant-hunting in summer and
leave the real work till winter when the


the railroad mans magazine

nights are long thats why we reverse the
deal they arent expecting trouble in
summer its twice the cinch you see

  graham nodded

  do you know said he ive been
thinking about the way i had my finger-
prints taken back in pemberton square
what would be the matter with all of us
wearing gloves then if anybody should
happen to leave a mark or anything-

   dave slapped him on the shoulder

  good idea he assented no flies
on that none whatever gloves it is for
everybody tumbler seemed pleased
even old adam smiled

    i imagine my frient said he slowly
in his labored english  dat you will haf
many goot suggestions to make before you
been mit us a very long vhile he turned
to dave  de spreader you got him

    yes answered dave  pianos going
to take charge of that and the wax i sup-
pose youll carry the keister as for me
the oils about enough for me to look after
well are we ready

    where do i fit  asked graham begin-
ning to tingle with a strange new excite-
ment as the men took their coats from the
hat-tree and began getting into them

  you buddy oh here-this puffing-
rod will do for a starter for you said dave
he slid a revolver into grahams pocket
graham shuddered so strongly the act
brought back to him memories of what had
happened in dills office more than four
years ago but he said nothing

   five minutes later they were all in the
racing-car a quiet respectable little party
as of well-to-do amateur motorists

   piano at the wheel threw in the low-
speed clutch the car coughed trembled
then with gathering momentum slid down
the asphalt slope of one hundred and
sixth street toward the park

   graham realized vaguely as in a dream
that at last he was embarked upon a course
whence there could be no turning back
upon the greatest adventure of his life rich
with possibilities of most tremendous mo-
ment for good-or ill

chapter xv

his first  crush 

the car turned north skirted the park
swung east into one hundred and
tenth street and made a smooth quick

run cross-town to third avenue here it
right-angled again up the avenue crossed
the bridge and before long veered into bos-
ton road piano guided it with sure and
dexterous skill perhaps the knowledge
that an accident of any sort might disclose
the sort of freight they carried even if it
did not set off the nitro-glycerine and
sprinkle them broadcast over the scenery
added steadiness to his grip

  with him on the front seat was adam
dave tumbler and graham sat together
in the tonneau in daves right-hand breast
pocket reposed the bottle of sap dave
therefore sat at the right of the other two
lest any one should happen to jostle him

   under the seat lay the satchel and a suit-
case the former contained the kit while
in the latter was concealed the powerful
 spreader the only bulky tool they count-
ed on having to use

  no way in this world for us to fall
down to-night remarked tumbler pull-
ing his flat english cap down tight as the
wind began to tug at it on the stretch be-
tween prospect hill and pelham manor

  an hour and a half will bring us to
southbridge two hours at the outside say
midnight by twelve-fifteen we ought to lie
in the bank youve got the crib down cold
you say i reckon well be headed for home
by one maybe sooner

  the talk ran on and on with graham
attentive to every word learning from every
syllable things which the average man has
no conception of faster faster still sped
the racing-car it ate the distance greedily
to new rochelle its acetylene lamps fling-
ing long tremulous shafts of radiance far
ahead through the town it slowed a bit
then hit the pace once more toward ma-
maroneck

  as it passed through port chester they
heard bells striking eleven presently stam-
ford lay behind glenbrook and norwalk
followed soon the car never skipping an
explosion the exhaust drumming its soft
music brrrrrrr with the precision of the
perfect mechanism it was

  there was scant talk now eacli of the
party was busy with his own thoughts as
the goal drew nearer nearer in the star-
less night

  north now the road ran through a di-
versified country of woods and rolling hills
in places the car ran into sand then as a
fine and misty rain settled down into slip-
pery skin-coats of mud that caused the tires
the steeled conscience



to skid a bit they paused for a few min-
utes north of new canaan to get the chains
out of the box and put them on the rear
wheels

   we cant afford to take any chances of
any kind you see remarked tumbler to
graham as the car got under way once
more  its all a matter of details from
the plant-hunting to the getaway every
time a break fails you can lay it to some

o	versight

  they say everybody in this line or
any other always overlooks some one point
thats why the  fingers  once in a while
cop us out some of us if they werent
boobs and mutton-heads almost from a to
z theyd flop more of us but as things are
were decently safe

    so piano here was telling me an-
swered graham  but-

  shhh cut it growled piano from
his place at the wheel time enough for
gas later stow that and keep your eyes
peeled you windy gervers no hoptalk
now 	

   silence followed save for the purring of
the- car the occasional squash and splatter
as it struck a muddy rut into the mens
faces drove the misty rain they muffled
up their great-coat collars about their ears
on on through the dark they sped their
machine seemingly drawn and guided for-
ward by the ribbons of light it jetted out
before

  two miles more at last said dave
touching piano on the shoulder piano
slackened speed and turned off the lights
thereafter they trundled along at a slow
jog meeting nobody save once a belated
farmer with a frightened horse that ran him
into the ditch he swore violently at them
but they replied not even by a laugh or a
jibe

   cautiously they crept into the town here
and there a window still showed its square-
panecl patch of illumination but for the
most part the place seemed wrapped in
sleep the street-lights few and feeble
did no more than cast faint rays across their
way down one side-street graham saw a
solitary and dejected-looking policeman
but this guardian of the peace did not even
so much as notice their noiseless passage
they followed closely the route laid down
for them by tumbler graham with in-
creasing nervousness took note of every-
thing-the railroad crossing the entrance
into the second street to the left then the

big white church with its tall pillars and
its scjuare spire fading eerily up into the
dark

   unseen the car trundled into the open
space beside the church turned and stopped
behind it out of sight of the street adam
climbed out first then piano dave de-
scended very carefully holding his hand to
his breast where lay the flask

   all right you now  whispered
tumbler to graham he too got out
twelve-fifteen he heard piano say
fine and dandy then tumbler
added here come now take these and
handed out first the suit-case then the
satchel

   presently the five men under cover of
darkness had one by one issued out onto
high street through an alley not a soul
was in sight  hold that gun ready
whispered piano  ive got one too
dont wait a minute in case of trouble but
throw it into john law for all youre
worth 

  rapidly and silently as specters they
turned dovn another unlighted alley fol-
lowing the lead of tumbler graham
straining his eyes could make out vaguely
the dark forms of the yeggmen suddenly
tumbler went stttt and graham saw
a little white circle of light fall on some
iron bars he perceived then that tum-
bler held an electric flash-lamp by its
dimly-reflected light he saw the dim eager
faces of the rest

  the spreader here he heard piatio
say in an undertone somebody was kneel-
ing in the mud came a click as the suit-
case opened then the electric flash showed
a curious apparatus being adjusted to the
bars all that graham could see was just
this tiling and a pair of hands at work the
effect was uncanny he shivered slightly
despite the drizzling closeness of the night
but only gripped his  cannon  more tight-
ly stick and slug the motto came to
his mind he waited breathlessly watch-
ing the work at the barred window

  the spreader he saw was a combina-
tion of simplicity and marvelous force one
of the most ingenious and useful tools im-
aginable as nearly as he could make out
it consisted of a solid steel screw with two
grip-nuts of steel at one end and a massive
hub-shaped nut in the middle this hub
was pierced with holes

  he saw hands adjust the thing so that
one end rested against the masonry window-


the railroad mans magazine

jamb while the other engaged a thick verti-
cal bar

  hold er commanded piano

  other hands held the thing in place
then a strong and heavy lever was slid home
in one of die holes graham saw the lever
turning the hub-like nut the spreader
lengdiened  all right now whispered
piano just keep a light on here and
ill have things loose in a jiffy 

  he withdrew the lever put it again into
another hole and again pulled it down
thus one hole by one he turned the great
nut the bar began to bend braced
though it was above and below by trans-
verse irons the metal had to yield steadily
round and round went the nut steadily the
bar bellied out all at onee snap it
went graham saw that it had been pulled
clean in two about three inches from its
insertion into the stone-work

  jove  thought he what chance has
any bar got against that 

  hardly two minutes later another bar
was broken and both had been bent up
out of the way

  during this time adam had opened the
satchel had taken out and screwed together
a high-grade steel sectional jimmy and was
now prepared to force the window inside
the bars

  the jimmy bit a hand put a pebble
under it for a fulcrum adam and tum-
bler threw their weight onto its outer end
while dave-with the rubber bottle in his
pocket-stood back out of harms way a
catch snapped the sash went up gra-
ham caught his breath

   flash the glim in there  whispered
piano the little white light glinted here
there showing an office with heavy and
old-fashioned furniture by the vague re-
flection graham caught a little spark of
light from a revolver in daves hand

  come on boys he heard adam say
here dave giff me de oil

  as had been previously arranged tum-
bler and dave were to be the  outside men
leaving adam and piano for the inside
work graham too was to accompany
them not only as a guard but also because
piano had insisted on giving him a chance
to learn the game-a game which the others
naturally already understood

  so graham realized the moment was
now come when for the first time in his
life he was to enter without warrant of
permission or law the property of other

men when for the first time he was to see
the actual working of experienced yeggs
he forgot almost to breathe the excite-
ment of the game was on him his eyes
stared through the gloom in his ears he
heard the blood-stream rushing fast

  easily quiedy adam peered in then
slid a leg over the sill stooped through the
opening drew his other leg in and dropped
noiselessly to the floor he reached out
and from dave took the rubber flask

  you next said piano graham clam-
bered after adam while tumbler lighted
the way for him with the flash-lamp last
came piano tumbler handed him the
light

   give us twenty minutes said piano
and were with you shoot if you have
to but first diplomacy

  go on go on answered tumbler
what dyou think i am a fritzer

  piano made no reply but pointing the
little beam of light this way and that ad-
vanced on noiseless soft-shod feet across
the office

  you switch he continued be ready
if we run into the watchman therell be a
muss sure take-a hand 

  they reached a door at the left adam
tried it

  locked off course said he piano
directed the light into the satchel the ger-
man chose a long-nosed pair of key-nippers
with hollowed-out jaws deftly he manip-
ulated this in the keyhole seized the stub
of the key and gently turned it a moment
later the door swung clear

  while piano flashed the light inside and
peeked through-an anxious moment al-
ways for every crook that breaks and en-
ters-graham stood listening keenly he
too looked he saw dimly a wire grating
some desks and stools and recognized the
conventional fittings of a bank office but
he had not long to wait for now the others
were advancing

  silently they all three entered the inner
room adam closed the door then they
stole along behind the desks the two
yeggs knew their way perfectly although
they never yet had seen the place daves
reconnaissance had made all plain to them
in a few seconds they had reached the fur-
ther end of the grating now they must
turn to the right and cross the floor of the
bank the vault they knew was at the
back

  like wraiths the little three-string ad-
the steeled conscience



vanced toward it but all at once a sound
came from somewhere off to the left-a
sound of stealthy footsteps grahams
heart leaped he knew instinctively that
a watchman had perceived them and was
creeping down a corridor the dark opening
of which he could just make out as greater
blackness in the gloom at the far corner
he felt a tug at his sleeve and ran forward
with the other two into the shelter of a little
alcove where stood two tables for the use of
patrons of the bank

  unbreathing the trio waited on came
the watchman they saw a yellow light
trembling along the floor then quite sud-
denly a dark figure appeared  uhhh 
they heard a grunt of surprise

  up went the figures arm in the unmis-
takable gesture of a man about to shoot a
pstol-hammer clicked but graham at
one side leaped like a panther he drove
his fist at the man it landed-hard gra-
ham heard the pistol clatter on the marble

  the watchmans cry died choked in its
inception by pianos grip on his throat
adam daring not to take a hand because of
the nitro stood back  tie him dats
all he whispered sibilantly the three
fighting men went down in a heap pianos
clutch never weakening the watchers
lantern flickered out ill-smelling

   in my right-hand pocket-the cord 
commanded piano graham fumbled it
out trembling with eagerness a strange and
wild passion filling him with a quick
dexterity he never knew lay in him he triced
the man piano gagged him with his own
handkerchief inside of a minute and a
half the watchman safely disposed of lay
under the tables in the alcove

  they heard his labored breathing the
creaking of his futile dumb struggles as
they stood there listening to determine
whether any further interference might be
expected

  but all was still except for the trickle
of water somewhere from a broken rain-
spout no sound at all

  veil boys now to vork  said adam

  they left the watchman and again ad-
vanced toward the vault

  hmmm old-fashioned brick affair
commented piano scornfully running the
circle of electric light rapidly over the
glazed surface of the bricks so assuring to
depositors so really useless if we want-
ed to sh that in with a sledge i guess it
wouldn t take long but the oils quicker

you watch now he added to graham

  youre going to learn a thing or two be-
lieve me 

  his inspection of the vault finished he
glinted the light over the door noting with
scorn the apparent solidity of the smooth
and handsomely-painted plates of the huge
hinges and the polished knob and dial
nickel and scroll-work never could fool
him

  i guess she wont bother us much
commented he  look at that crack 
and with his forefinger he indicated a tiny
line between the door and the jamb that the
ordinary observer would never so much as
have noticed

  an old-fashioned worker would have
taken a punch and hammer made a dent
for his drill-point to catch on then with
lots of elbow-grease and sweat would have
bored a hole into this he would with bel-
lows and funnel have blown some  puff 
and touched it off with a fuse nothing
like that for adam and piano

  already adam was softening up in his
deft hands a mass of soap and wax putty-
like and sticky this stuff he quickly
spread all up and down the edges of the
door the top and bottom leaving only a
little space where the crack had attracted
pianos scornful attention

  then while graham watched him with
keen attention he fashioned a small cup
at the bottom of the unsoaped space

 dere sighed he now for de
grease you get de cap and battery

  carefully he drew the rubber bottle from
his pocket uncorked it and with a steady
hand poured part of its contents into the
cup the formidable liquid seeped down
into the crack filling the air-tight space be-
tween the door and the jamb piano in
the meanwhile had taken from the satchel
a roll of insulated wire and a dry-battery
together with a detonating-cap he set the
cap in the soap-cup made the proper at-
tachment and uncoiled die wire while gra-
ham held the light for him adam poured
a few more drops of the nitro-glycerine over
the cap

   now said he  ve blanket her and
den set her off

  quickly they piled some chairs against
the vault and covered everything with a
heavy rug the wires were then led off to
the alcove out of the direct line of explo-
sion

  all ready asked piano totally indif-


the railroad mans magazine

ferent to the writhing and groaning of the
pinioned watchman

  all retty answered adam let her
go

  graham tense with excitement saw a
tiny spark in the gloom instantly a dull
and muffled shock thudded through the
room hardly louder than the slamming of
a very heavy door the chairs tipped over
slid and fell to the floor the echoes ceased
all grew still

  piano snatched the lamp from grahams
trembling hand in a second he was throw-
ing light over the door while graham stood
eagerly watching and adam shoved the
chairs away graham heard piano laugh
he saw that both hinges had been broken
off in a jagged line and that an irregular
crack extended from the dial half-way up
the edge

    gift her anodder and shell cave said
adam calm and judicious as though it were
merely a question of an obstinate ice-box

  fifteen minutes later the outer door had
been blown again and the shattered pieces
laid aside the inner one opened merely by
pianos delicate manipulation-the lock
was a simple combination of no real diffi-
culty--and the damper or cash-drawer
ripped open with another and smaller
charge

  before grahams astonished eyes ap-
peared thick stacks of bills neatly bound
with paper strips together with some dozen
coin-sacks of stout canvas his hand shook
so that he could hardly keep the pencil of
light on the treasure

  well remarked piano this looks
all right dont it daves a good steerer
thats no dream he certainly didnt put us
up against an empty  bloomer  this time 
with entire coolness as he spoke he and
adam were cleaning out the drawer  dave
has a way with him he added of finding
out just when deposits are heaviest that
beats all creation

  deposits may be heavy here to-night
chuckled adam but diwidend-checks vill
le light to-morrow most off dis  darb
you know he explained to graham be-
longs to de inter-city tramvay corpora-
tion dey got to go shy for a vhile on
buyin franchises from honest and liard-
vorkin law-makers eh vot

  so saying he replaced the tools in the
satchel stowed away the dry-battery and
the leading-wires and then with pianos
help carefully packed in the money two

bundles that would not fit he stowed in his
pockets he locked die bag

  they left the vault then and came back
into the large dark silent room they
set the chairs up and by excess of profes-
sional pride in neatness laid the rug again
piano took the light went and flickered it
over the watchman to assure himself the
fellow was in no danger of suffocation

   sorry weve got to leave you side-tracked
that way till morning he apologized with
mock politeness  but theres no way out
of it

  aber jo maybe contradicted adam
he felt his way over to the telephone and
unhooked the receiver when the exchange
answered he casually remarked

  send somebody down to de first na-
tional ven you get roundt to it deres a
man in drouble here then he hung up
laughing

   i guess dat vill relief him pooty soon
said he  perhaps next time he vont be
so anxious to mix vit de bull-busters veil
boys now ve go ve got time enough but
none to loose raus 

  quickly they retraced their line of en-
trance and rejoined the others they
packed the spreader distributed the bur-
dens and by separate ways already de-
cided upon reached the motor which was
standing ready behind the church

  dave cranked the engne it caught
they all climbed in

  easily the car slipped away just before
it reached the railway crossing they heard
a trilling whistle the rapping of a night-
stick and soon thereafter boots running
rapidly over cobble-stones

  but as piano let out the powerful ma-
chine the sleeping town vanished it faded
away behind them in the dark and pres-
ently they heard  sound save the swift
pulsing of the engine and the rush of the
night-wind against their faces

chapter xvi

progress and a piece of news

the end of august found graham well
broken to the fascinating work no
longer a mere filler-in but a useful ser-
viceable and respected member of probably
the swellest mob that ever operated in
america the newspapers that summer
chronicled a long series of unusually daring
crushes now here now there within a
the steeled conscience



radius of a hundred miles from new york
city sometimes two breaks would occur
in a single night miles apart yet showing
evidences of having been put through by
the same mysterious gang not one member
of which could be rounded up by the au-
thorities

  many an old-time suspect the miserable
 prussian  or tramp had to be ditched or
put in  stir  as a substitute for the real
men or as a sop to public opinion like
lightning that never strikes twice in the
same place the mob could never be fore-
stalled its  finders  or  plant-hunters
the police knew must be marvelously clever

  graham served in that capacity on sev-
eral occasions his keen powers of ob-
servation and his high natural intelligence
made him invaluable rewards offered by
city county or state officers brought no
results stone and steel proved no effective
barriers no clues were ever left save an
auto-track which became obliterated in a
few miles the old-time hand-car getaways
became things of simplicity itself to trace
beside this modern mystification

  graham lived at the flat all this time
he made no friends outside he let his
beard grow as piano had advised and
trimmed it to give himself the appearance
of indeed what he really was-a young
professional man though he shared with
the others in the brassing-up he carefully
saved all this money and kept a strict pri-
vate account of it with the amount place
where taken and date set down in business-
like form what money he spent was all
his own drawn through an intermediary
from his bank where he still had between
three arid four hundred dollars not one of
the mob suspected that he ever intended to
return to the upper world again

  piano of course knew what had led him
to join the gang but piano kept a close
mouth graham when one day repaying
the fifty that had been loaned him in bos-
ton asked piano point-blank his motive in
having dius taken him into so close a circle
piano with an apparent equal frankness
answered that the underworld needed just
such talents of eye ear and brain as gra-
ham possessed graham saw clearly that
his teacher entertained hopes of bringing
him permanently into the work that idea
he finally decided was all that lay in
pianos mind though once in a while some
little uneasy suspicion of possibly another

to be

motive not quite so clear would force itself
upon his unwilling attention

  occasionally piano would bring up the
matter of the security storage warehouse
and what lay therein as though to stimu-
late grahams interest yet for the most
part that subject was not touched upon
two or three times graham showed im-
patience to be at the job but then piano
always restrained him counseling patience
and greater knowledge

  once graham and he walked through
spring street they glanced up at the
huge building of concrete and steel impreg-
nable as the fastnesses of carcassonne were
to any medieval warrior

  a hard crib that piano remarked as
they strolled on not venturing to delay very
long before the warehouse  i tell you
switch the man who can crack that de-
serves the title of caunfort ladran-which
means a top-notch boss a-one person of
quality

   its- certainly a problem worthy of a
master no mush of a twenty-two-karat
worker will ever solve it getting inside
the building is only half the game the
rooms once you get at them are built of
heavy armor plate and concrete no chance
to use the soup in there because of half-
a-dozen watchmen and also because it
wouldnt do any good

   i	read in a scientific review while it was
being built just how the room walls and
the doors were constructed of layers of tool-
steel and soft iron all- fastened by invis-
ible- screws so arranged that each one ends
against solid metal the bigger vaults are
surrounded with railroad-iron with the ts
of the rails dovetailing into each other

    theres no later word than this in pro-
tection im sorry to say the warehouse
people advertise that their place is abso-
lutely proof against fire water and the fra-
ternity weve got a little planning yet to
do you and i before we go against it the
best we know yet is the good old nitro-
glycerine but- piano shook his head
as though in despair  old dill was no
dead one he continued  when he shoved
the stuff away just where he did hes
a wise boy sure as guns

  all the way back to the flat graham was
pondering studying thinking the prob-
lem seemed insoluble but the future he
knew might bring the answer to that riddle
as to every other
merry moments in mathematics for the methodical minds
of the masters of mensuration

     we want some new teasers do any of you boys know some good ones

   merry christmas to all the boys and their mothers wives
   sisters and best girls from the man in the magazine cab

in january

the first train to leave our shops for the glad
new year of  is already made up we
have inspected it thoroughly gone through every
bit of rolling stock from the fine atlantic to the
observation-car and it looks to us like a real
hummer

  one of the most important things that we shall
carry will be the first of a series of articles on
freight it is called  the a b c of freight it
shows how freight rates are made how freight is
carried and how it produces a great revenue for
the railroad in short it is the history of freight
so graphically described and so ably written that ii
will be a great education to all interested in the
subject the author is john b thomson author
of  despatching trains by telephone in this
issue

  we have secured from w j knight the engi-
neer who actually drove the locomotive  general
in its famous civil-war journey when it was cap-
tured near big shanty georgia april   his
own story of this famous affair it is a thrilling
document and will prove a valuable addition to
the controversy concerning that famous engine

  another very practical article especially directed
to young railroad men is written by c h coe it
contains the sort of stuff that a young man rising
in the railroad world ought to know and remem-
ber

  arno doscli will be with us again with a series
of his interesting hairbreadth stories which are
this time entitled  facing the music and
charles frederick carter who has jusf returned
from europe will write about the difference be-
tween american and european railroads-and
there is quite a difference

  our two new serials  mason the grizzly
by chauncey thomas and  through by sunrise
by william s wright get on the main line in this
number they are going to continue too as good
as they have begun

  in the short-fiction car for january we find
 the death tie by robert t creel a story of
unusual force and a particularly good new year
yarn by robert fulkerson hoffman then there
are three or four others that we do not care to tell
about just now but in order to let you know that
the humor tap is wide open we announce  a
flagging flirtation by lillian bennet-thomp-
son smiths last game by sumner lucas

 the boos and the babies by augustus witt-
feld while honk and horace have the time of
their life trying to make some easy money

  j e smith who writes  the observations of
a country station-agent has some christmas
dope about railroad men that will make you want
to open the laughter throttle and forget it gilson
willets will present one of his best bunches of
middle-west stories

  these are only a few of the good things

  all aboard for the happy new year special

telephone vs telegraph

we sincerely believe that the article on train-
despatching by telephone in this number
is a perfectly fair and impartial presentation of a
new movement in an important branch of rail-
roading but if there are any operators who think
otherwise we will be glad to hear from them we
warmly welcome any claim that you boys may
make that will prove that the telephone is a
menace to your future

  some of the letters that we have already re-
ceived from operators indicate a strong belief that
the telephone will eventually replace the tele-
graph there is no more chance of this as we
have said elsewhere than there was of the tele-
graph replacing the mails when it was first put in
operation let us take a case in point

  the pennsylvania railroad one of the strongest
advocates of the telephone in train-despatching
in an effort to increase the interest in its telegraph
school at bedford pennsylvania has sent broad-
cast a pamphlet describing the work which it is
doing in the institution the number of students
enrolled up to september  of this year was two
hundred and forty-three of which number one
hundied and fifty-one have graduated and are
now employed as telegraphers the pennsyl-
vania expects to increase this number materially
by its campaign

  the students at the bedford school are taught
practical railroading the regular railroad tele-
graph wires are run through the school and train
orders and telegrams are received and trans-
mitted in the same way as is done in regular prac-
tise an automatic sending machine with a trans-
mitter that can be set at any speed has been in-
stalled in the school this machine is used to
teach the students to receive messages and as it




i

the railroad mans magazine

transmits at a uniform speed it is of great ad-
vantage the school is equipped with a library
as well as a miniature railroad with a perfect
block-signal system in addition to learning
telegraphy the students are taught the duties of
station-agents in order that they may be prepared
to take charge of stations immediately upon grad-
uation

  in the pamphlet which the pennsylvania rail-
road has just issued it is announced that the
school of telegraphy was established for the pur-
pose of educating young men to become telegraph
or telephone operators and to make it as easy as
possible only a nominal fee is charged students
graduate in from six to eight months and as the
pamphlet states  all graduates are given positions
on the pennsylvania railroad with the assurance
that if they are faithful in the discharge of their
duties they will have steady employment and will
be placed in line for promotion to higher posi-
tions

  certainly this does not look as if telegraphy in
railroad service was on the wane

oil-burning engines

rear admiral robley d evans

usn retired who recently made a tour
of the pacific coast says that the oil-burning en-
gines of the different roads he traveled on im-
pressed him as being a step in the right direction
admiral evans examined a number of these loco-
motives personally and although he is a man
who has spent his life on war-ships and has ad-
vocated many new ideas for the navys betterment
he is a close student of all kinds of mechanism
and his words must carry some weight he be-
lieves that oil will some day supersede coal entire-
ly on our locomotives if this is so and it is a
statement which cannot be sneezed at oil will be-
come the most valuable product in the united
states if as he says it stands for economy
cleanliness and safety in locomotive propulsion
the chances are the burning of oil will become
more and more a matter of necessity

 thirteen

we are not superstitious we never have been
and we would gladly borrow thirteen dol-
lars from any one who would lend it to us we
have always believed that calling   a hoodoo
ntynber is a great mistake and we have some lit-
tle proof of our belief in a telegraphic train order
sent to us by w m rogers of the georgia rail-
road atlanta georgia

  in this particular train order the number  ap-
pears eight times the train order is no  and
it was issued august  to the conductor and
engineer of train no  and says  no 
engine  and nu  engine  will meet at
famans

  this order was given to the trainman at 
pm aside from this no  arrived only 
minutes late and the engineer had  silver dol-
lars in his pocket and just for good measure

the order was written on  form

ix the last two or three issues of your magazine

that i c car  seems to have started
something but there are others how
about  we have one some time
ago an enterprising reporter with great visions of
a scoop wrote a fine story about i c 
coming in from the south with so many hoboes
on it that there wasnt even standing room

  i have seen m d t  several times and
there are other cars with straight numbers

  i have not seen i c  for a long time and
dont know where it is but am looking for it-
i cvswitchman

editor the railroad mans magazine

in your october number i read about the magic
car number  in the last twenty years
i have been watching for all kinds of car
numbers such as straights full hands combina-

saw b and o -a steel hopper going from
glenwood pennsylvania to willow grove loaded
with furnace slag this is the only car i ever saw
with that number i think your last issue is the
best of all the railroad mans magazine
for mine there is not a book printed to-day that
can give railroad boys or any other boys the in-

additional thanks

thanksgiving day this year brought
with it an event for which the traveling pub-
lic should give added thanks on novcmler 
on the editorial carpet



the pennsylvania railroads tunnels which have
taken seven years to complete were opened and
a regular train service was inaugurated from the
immense seventh avenue depot in new york to
all western points and for the first time in his-
tory there is an unbroken rail connection be-
tween montauk point long island and san
francisco california at last the great penn-
sylvania system makes new york city its real
eastern terminal

  oil october  through the courtesy of the penn-
sylvania railroad officials a special train accom-
modating a party of magazine editors was run
from the new york terminal under the hudson
to the hackensack meadows and return afford-
ing an excellent opportunity to inspect the work-
ings of the new system

  the editor of the railroad mans magazine
made the run in the cab of the liuge electric loco-
motive and viewed the tunnel construction and
the operation of the block system and the great
interlocking plant which distributes the trains
over the network of tracks at the entrance to the
new york terminal

  the inspection of the tunnels and the great
depot proved conclusively that the pennsylvania
railroad has fulfilled all the amazing promises
that it made to-day the dream of president
cassatt now dead has come true in the comple-
tion of the greatest railroad terminal the world
has ever known



wb stand corrected

one of our readers writes in to us from ann
arbor michigan that he has got the goods
on us this time for sure our critic is cal stew-
art and we wish to thank him for pointing out a
bull in our october number where mr dosch in
his moments of emergency tells of john
crowleys runaway switch-engine which became
unmanageable due to the disabling of its  steer-
ing gear mind you  steering gear on a
switch-engine

  whether mr doschs fondness for automobil-
ing got the better of him for-the moment or not
or the editor thought he was aboard a yacht we
are unable to say but as any ten-year-old boy
knows that nothing connected with a railroad has
any sort of steering gear we can only hope that
mr stewart does not lay the blunder to igno-
rance on the part of the writer any one who has
followed mr doschs work would hardly be apt to
accuse him of such an unpardonable sin as think-
ing for a moment that the wheels of a locomotive
are guided in any other way than the rails they
follow what he meant was controlling gear but
in some manner the wrongword was substituted

  we are always grateful to our readers for call-
ing our attention to any slips of this character
which they may happen to discover for we do not
pretend to be infallible though we are glad to find
that only on rare occasions that fault can be found

and in the november number in the article on

the walschaert valve-gear we made it read that
the locomotive  wm mason  was supplied with
this gear in the year  it should have read

gan who kindly loaned us the photograph in

a brakeman protests

editor the raiiroad mans magazine

looking over your october number i no-
ticed the article on  the fine art of run-
ning a freight by charles frederick car-
ter it was very interesting reading about the
way traffic is handled in the east on the three and
four track systems where the con does not handle
any orders and the shack does not have anything
to do except to get in the way

  i would like to know if they carry a bunch of
car-knockcrs on the high-flying freight-trains if
the train-detainer does the flagging and if the
shacks are in the habit of setting out cars without
setting any brakes or docs the despatcher tend to
the brakes also

  i have never done any of that high-toned bra-
king back east where they have a whole clear yard
from one end of the division to the other but i
have broke on our western humps and if we
are only trainmen to-day we still do quite a lot
of braking when we are holding a train down
a hump it is a good thing to have us in the way

   i believe that if a brakeman protects his train
looks over the running gear on fifty or sixty cars
and that no broken beams are -trying to put a
train into the sage-brush or to the bottom of a
canon he is earning his share of wages

   and in this old land of ours we are thankful to
have one pair of rails to run on instead of four
or five

  i railroaded in the link-and-pin days and have
worked on most of the roads west of chicago i
have seen railroading in the tropics and in all of
my time i have always had something else to do
except hold down the tallow-pot seat

who knows jack conway

editor the railroad mans magazine

i am an interested reader of your magazine
and although i do not know much about
railroads i read every page because my
father is a railroad man and it is in the hope of
finding him that i appeal to you he may be a
reader of it too

  my fathers name is john charles conway
commonly known as  jack and for a number of
years he was an engineer on the c b and q
having what i believe is or was called the kansas
city meat run he was last heard of at keiths-
burg illinois

  i was four years old when i saw him last and
i am now twenty he of course has changed in
sixteen years but i can describe him as mother
told me he stood six feet two inches in height
and was light complexioned and had blue eyes
he was i believe a very heavy man this is
not very definite but it is the best i can do


the railroad mans magazine

  your magazine has a wide circulation and
surely somebody in this country who knew my
father will write and tell me about him it is the
one wish of my life that  find him he is my
father and i have never heard from him but i
love him dearly and would indeed feel grateful
if vou could find just a little space in which to
print this any one knowing anything about him
may write to his daughter

 self-propelled machine-shop

the north coast railroad is a new line being
built through central and western washing-
ton from spokane to the cascades during the
construction there are of course a large number
of locomotives and cars in regular service which
are continually getting further and further away
from the base and in order to properly maintain
this equipment a traveling machine-shop has been
designed

  this shop consists of a specially constructed
very large box car with numerous windows on

-	ach side which encloses the gas-engine for driving
the tools and a selection of tools suited for the
ork to be done the gas-engine is a twelve
horse-power fairbanks-morse and is connected
through a friction-clutch to the wheels so that the
car is capable of going from place to place under
its own power and can also do switching to get
into the most convenient location

first train over w p

the first through passenger-train over the
western pacific between the coast and salt

lake city was a special from san francisco it
irade the run in thirty-six and a half hours which

	ill be the time for the regular service for thirty
to sixty days when the time probably will be
-hortcncd

those who have been over the line say that there
i- marked diversity in the beauties of nature
 -ad out in a lavish way at various points alow
the feather river there heing between eighty and

ninety miles of picturesque canon scenery and in
the sacramento valley there is a stretch of two
hundred miles as level as a floor running almost
at a tangent into oakland

our mother tongue

editor the railroad mans magazine

wish to say that the railroad mans
magazine has filled a space that was left
open in literature for a long time-railroad
writing in other words a story or incident told
as it was told  down at the roundhouse in good
clean-cut railroad talk leaving out that would-be
slang

  while railroad men use slang they use il alto-
gether different to what our would-be railroad
writers have it and from the first number of the
railroad mans magazine  could detect the
true ring of the  language as quickly as i could

good all through

editor the railroad mans magazine

am a full believer in the idea that  a good
thing ought to be boosted after constant-
ly reading your magazine for more than a
year i pronounce it the best thing that i have
ever found in the way of a genuine entertainer i
am a traveling salesman and to tell the truth i
would just as soon try to get along without my
expense account as my good-all-through railroad

one way in which you could improve upon this
particular magazine and that is to make il a

from the author of mccracken

editor the railroad mans magazine 

in your october number i note a request for
the poem  mccracken i happen to be
-the author of it and take pleasure in trans-
mitting herewith the poem in its entirety

   in  by the light of the lantern page   j
j m of manila asks for information concern-
ing the position of  qualified flagman a quali-
fied flagman is a brakeman who having passed
the required examination is pronounced capable
of performing the duties of a flagman he re-
tains his position as brakeman but when an extra
flagman is needed he is called upon to serve in
that capacity he is known as  extra flagman
in the same department september number
page  a w b wisconsin asks if there
are any locomotives running which require two
firemen to which you reply in the negative on
the wyoming division of the lehigh valley rail-
road there were and i presume are a number of
auxiliary engines employing two firemen

           mccracken

when mccracken went a braking it was ten
to one that he
a brakeman solid gold and fourteen karat
fine would be

he looked just like a hero so proudly did he stand
upon the swaying box car with a brake-stick in
his hand

mccrackens hair was neatly brushed mccrack-
      ens face was clean

and on his clothes a speck of dust was nowhere
      to be seen

the over-clothes mccracken wore were neat and
      bright and blue

and the slightest glance would tell you that mc-
      crackens shoes were new

the fit of them was perfect and he had them
      neatly laced

while his shapely hands were in a handsome pair
      of gloves encased 

he wore a four-in-hand beneath his collar knotted
       tight

he smiled at the conductor and his teeth were
      milky white

and when he wasnt busy with his winning irish
      smile

mccracken whistled gaily-oh so gaily all the
      while

mccrackens jaunty cap upon his head was firmly
      set-

mccracken was a brakeman fourteen karat fine
      you bet

but when it came to braking what mccracken
      didnt know

would fill a book two hundred thousand pages
      long or so

he didnt know an east-bound train from one
      that traveled west

he got flustered in the signals so at them he
      merely guessed

he tried to give the eagle-eye the sign to go
      ahead

but it was the back-up signal that lie handed
      out instead

they backed into a hand-car and they put it on
      the bum

they asked him why he did it and mccracken
      just kept mum

then he said he would do better if theyd give him
       one more chance

hut the handsome irish brakeman led the crew a
      lively dance

they sent him for a gasket and he brought a
      coupling-pin

but mccracken seemed so innocent to roast him
      was a sin

lie tried to turn a switch and wondered what on
      earth could be

the matter till his buddy showed him how to
      use the key

he thought he was obliged to twist each brake-
      wheel that he saw

he didnt know that when he broke a seal he
      broke a law

he didnt mean to do things but he did them
      iust the- same

for to blunder was his nature as mccracken was
      his name

to tell the things mccracken did would take a
      year or two

twere easier in fact to tell the things he did
      not do

but mccracken reached the limit of ignorance
      when he tried

to take the derail from the track and throw the
      thing aside

and when the engine in a little fit of spite broke
       down

mccracken just got in the  way by tinkering
      around


the railroad mans magazine

he wouldnt slay where he was put as all good
      brakemen ought-

his presence was required at the head-end so he
       thought

at length the eagle-eve got up and plugged him
      on the mouth

and when we saw mccracken last his jaw was
      drooping south

when he got in from work that night his over-
      clothes were lorn

his cap was not so jaunty as it had been in the
      morn

his four-in-hand was crooked and his hair was
      all awry

he didnt try to whistle for his throat and lips

       were dry

he made no attempt to smile-the reason wasnt
      hard to guess

for his eyes were filled with cinders and his
      heart with bitterness

his gloves erstwhile so handsome now were
      ripped and torn and soiled

mccrackens sad appearance told of one long day
      of toil

he walked into the office and straightway his job
       resigned

for mccracken was aweary-yes in body soul
      and mind

mccracken went a farming and willingly ill bet
whatever youll put up on it that he is farming
yet

we thank mrs oxeil for her interesting letter
and the valuable information that it contains and
we also thank her for the words of mccracken
and we hope that the boys will not fail to read
her excellent little story  the aerial mail pub-
lished on page - in this number of our maga-

    two morf old songs

    ix the baggage-car ahead

ox a dark stormy night as the train rattled on
all the passengers had gone to bed
except one young man with a babe on his
arm

who sat there with a bowed-down head

 he innocent one commenced crying just then

as though iu poor heart would break

oi- angry man said  make that child stop its
       noise

for youre keeping all of us awake

put it out said another dont keep it in
      here

weve paid for our berths and want rest

jut never a word said the man with the child
as he fondled it close to his breast

 where is its mother  go lake it to her-
this a lady then softly said

 i wish that i could was the mans sad reply

 rut shes dead in the coach ahead

 every eye filled with tears when his story he told
 of a wife who was faithful and true

he told how hes saved up his earnings for years
just to build up a home for two

how when heaven had sent them this sweet little
      babe

their young happy lives were blessed

in tears he broke down when he mentioned her

      name

and in tears tried to tell them the rest

every woman arose to assist with the child

there were mothers and wives on that train
and soon was the little one sleeping in peace
with no thoughts of sorrow and pain

next morn at a station he bade all good-by

 god bless you he softly said

each one had a story to tell in their home
of the baggage-coach ahead

while the train rolled onward a husband sat in

        tears

thinking of the happiness of just a few short
      years

for babys face brings pictures of a cherished
      hope thats dead

but babys cries cant wake her in the baggage-

      coach ahead

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months on a city
lot  feet square

rvo the average poultry-

	man that would seem
impossible and when we tell
you that we have actually
done a  poultry bus-
iness with  hens on a
corner in the city garden 
feet wide by  feet long
we are simply stating facts
it would not be possible to
get such returns by any one
of the systems of poultry
keeping recommended and
practiced by the american
people still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

note lie condition of these three months old pullets these pullets and their ancestor for
                generations have never been allowed to run oultide he coops

the philo system is unlike all other ways of keeping
poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing tilings in poultry work
that have always been considered impossible and getting unheard-of results
that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches of the work
necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how to sot egg
that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg nnd how to raise nearly all the
hicks hatched it given complete plan- in detail how to make everything
necessary to run the business and at less than half the cost required to handle
the poultry business in any other mauuei

two-pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square font to the broiler and the broiler
are of the very best quality bringing here  rents a pound above the highest
market price

our six-month-old pullets are laying at the rate of
 egos each per month

in a p-ice of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of any dev-i ip-
tion is fed and the food used is inexpensive a compared with food others
are using

olir new book tiie pllll system ok poultry keeping gives full
particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple easy-to-
uiiderstaud directions that are right to the point anil  pages of illusi ra-
tions showing all branches of the work from start to hnisli

dont let the chicks die in the shell

one of the secrets of success is to save all the chickeus that aie fully de-
veloped at hatching time whether they can crack the shell or not it is a
simple trick and believed to be the secret of the ancient egyptians and
chinese which enabled them to sell the chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at fifteen cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but little trouble and
jiave a good supply any day in the year winter or summer it is just as

impossible to get a large egg yield without green food as it is lo keep a cow
without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on each chicken

no lamp required no dauger of chilling over-heating or burning up the
chickens us with brooders mlng lamps or any kind ol lire they also keep the
lice off the chickens automatically r kill any that may be on them when
placed in the brooder our book gives full plans and the right to make and
use them one can easily be made in an hour at a cost ol  t  cents

my dbar mr pmro 	valley fall n v oct  

alter another years work with your system of poultry keeping making
three years in all i am thoroughly convinced of its practicability i raised
all my chickft in your brondvr-goops containing your flrelr hrooders and-
kept them there until they were nearly matured decreasing the number in
each coop however a- they grew in sle those who have visited my plant
have been unanimous in their praise of my birds raised by this svatem

dear sir-no doubt you will be interested to learn i iur success in keep-
ing poultry by the philo system our tirst years work i now nearly com-
pleted it has given us an income of over  from ix pedigree hens and
one cockerel had we understood the work as well as we nowdo after a
cars experience we could easily have made over  from the six hens
in addition to the profits from the sale of pedigree chicks we have cleared
over  running our hatchery plant consistingof  cycle hatchers we
are pleased with the results and expect to do better the coming year with
best wishes we are	very truly yours mrs c p goodrich

mr k r pitiio elmira n y	south britain conn april  

dear sir-i have followed your system as close a i could  the result is a
complete success if there can be any improvement on nature your brooder
is it the first experience i had with your system was last december i
batched  chicks under two hens put them as soon as hatched in one of
your brooders out of doors and at the age of three months i sold them at c
a pound they then averaged lbs each and the man i sold them to said
they were the finest he ever saw and he wants all i can wpaiv this season
