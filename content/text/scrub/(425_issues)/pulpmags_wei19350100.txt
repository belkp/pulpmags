 black bagheela a thrill-tale of dark horror by bassett morgan arlton eadie seabury quinn clark ashton smith rulers of the future a powerful weird- scientific novel by paul ernst psychiana the ne w psychological religion a new and revolutionary religious teaching based entirely on the
       misunderstood sayings of the galilean carpenter and designed to
       show how to find and use the same identical power that he used



psychiana

  believes and teaches as follows

first-that there is no such thing as a subconscious mind

second-that there is in this universe a far more potent and dynamic
   power the manifestations of which have been erroneously credited to some
   other supposed power called the subconscious mind

third-that this invisible dynamic power is the very same power
   that jesus used when he staggered the nations by his so-called miracles
   and by raising the dead

fourth-that jesus had no monopoly on this power

fifth-that it is possible for every normal human being understanding
   spiritual law as he understood it to duplicate every work that
   this carpenter of galilee ever did when he said the things
   that i do shall ye do also-he meant exactly what he said

sixth-that this dynamic power is not to be found within but has its
   source in a far different direction

seventh-that the words of this galilean carpenter went a
   thousand miles over the heads of his hearers  years
   ago and are still a thousand miles over the heads of
   those who profess to follow him today

eighth-that this same mighty invisible pulsating throbbing
   power can be used by anyone-at any hour of the day or night

ninth-that when once understood and correctly used this mighty power is
   abundantly able and never fails to give health happi-
   ness and overwhelming success in whatever proper line it may be
   desired

dr frank b robinson

one of the keenest psychological minds this country has ever produced
and one of the most earnest intense searchers into the spiritual realm
believes after years of experimentation and research that there is in
this world today an unseen power or force so dynamic in itself that
all other powers or forces fade into insignificance beside it
he believes that this power or force is the very same power
that jesus used he believes further that the entire world includ-
ing the present church structure missed in its entirety the
message that he came to bring he believes that

the world is on the verge of the most stupen-
dous spiritual upheaval it has ever experienced

     every reader of this magazine is cordially invited to write
psychiana for more details of this revolutionary teaching which
might very easily be discussed the entire world round dr
robinson will tell you something of his years of search for the truth
as he knew it must exist and will give you a few facts connected
with the founding of psychiana no obligations whatso-

ulers of the future

     by paul ernst

the story of a tfip through the universe with the speed of light
and incredible monsters that rule the human race
hundreds of millions of years from now

the beginning for me of the fan-
tastic story i am about to relate
took place in the most prosaic sort
of surroundings

  it was a spring morning of the year
 i was in a large room outfitted as
an office it was quite an ordinary-looking
office and the man behind the big walnut
desk looked bke any average business-
man

  he was mild-mannered this man be-
hind the desk he bad on a sober dark
blue business suit he was a bit below
average height and inclined to rotundity
only in his eyes and forehead could be
read hints of his true greatness his eyes
deep-set under heavy gray eyebrows were
a sort of translucent gray-green and his
forehead was wide and high with the
smooth outward bulge of the dreamer
rulers of the future



this was george p ticknor colossus of
science

  striding up and down the office as if
impatient of the restraint of any four
walls was another man a distinctly
different type this one six feet three
heavily muscled and vast-shouldered with
a small blond spade beard and heavy
blond hair he was a man of action his
face was immobile and his light blue eyes
almost secretive in their expressionless-
ness but the quick restless movements of
his great body told of a spirit that longed
for things to combat he was wayland
brock wealthy adventurer with the heart
of a pioneer and explorer-born years too
late into a tamed world

  and seated there beside the desk to
interview these two famous men was-
myself one of the youngest and least im-
portant of reporters on the capetoum
globe a self-conscious youngster with
reddish hair and hands and feet that
seemed always getting in the way ray-
mond woodward thats me

  your paper doesnt think very highly
of our modest plans does it brock had
said when i introduced myself but his
smile took the sting from the words
which had to do with the fact that i had
been sent instead of some veteran report-
er who signed his name to his work

   it doesnt matter professor ticknor
said quickly laying his hand on my shoul-
der for an instant the younger the
man the more elastic his imagination-
and the more chance he has of assimilat-
ing the facts we have to give him

  two fine kindly men these with the
simplicity of true greatness i warmed to
them

  and then there in that commonplace-
looking room with the spring sunshine
coming in the windows to gild the home-
jy-looking old-fashioned furniture pro-
fessor ticknor began to outline his in-

credible plans while the striding giant
brock grunted from time to time as some
particularly salient point was touched
upon

  we are starting on a journey into
space began ticknor as calmly as
though speaking of a projected trip to
europe we are going to alpha cen-
tauri

  alpha centauri i wrinkled my fore-
head over that one then classroom
memories came back to me and i guess
my mouth hung open for a moment

  alpha centauri the nearest star to
earth-but so distant even in its com-
parative nearness that it took light our
fastest traveler more than four years to
come from there to here

  we shall go in a space-projectile
which i have invented and perfected and
which mr brock has financed in building
and equipping out into the heav-
ens-

  his eyes kindled and brock stopped
his pacing a moment

  ---out into space to see what staff

the stars are made of till now we have
known them only through telescopes but
we-my friend and i-will find out at
first hand what they are are they blaz-
ing suns or cold luminous bodies are
they solid fluid or vaporous how were
they born and what will be their future
all these things we will find out by per-
sonal observation with the aid of instru-
ments that are at least as wonderful-if
net more so-as the space-ship itself
which will bear us forward

i managed to make my pencil work in
recording these impossible things
but i was not at all sure that professor
ticknor and wayland brock werent try-
ing to play a joke on somebody

   but the speed you will have to attain
i objected how on earth can you man-


weird tales

age to get there and back in one lifetime
we shall go with the speed of light
replied ticknor indeed we shall travel
on a beam of light but ill explain

  it has long been known that a beam
of light strikes an object in its path with
a definite impact that impact till now
has been so slight as to be almost im-
measurable but now i have a method of
producing a light so powerful and exert-
ing so much force on an object in its
path that it propels that object as a can-
non propels a projectile my space-ship
in a word will be shot from earth to
alpha centauri by a super-searchlight
he seized pencil and paper and began
to draw

   this is the projectile he said sketch-
ing in a thing that looked not unlike an
old-style rifle cartridge and this is the
gun from which it is fired he drew
an object that looked like a shallow
trench-mortar

   in the bottom of the gun or rather
searchlight is placed a mass of radium
the projectile is lowered into the mouth
of the gun as a bullet is rammed into the
barrel of an old-time muzzle-loader the
radium is instantly broken down when i
throw a switch from inside the shell a
beam of light of almost incalculable
power is produced the projectile is shot
forth with the velocity of light traveling
in the straight line of light toward its
objective and in the bowl of the search-
light is left nothing but a little lump of
lead you see

  i think so i said how do you
manage to break down your radium so
instantaneously 

  thats nobodys business but ours
said brock bluntly

  professor ticknor shrugged that is
one of the few things about our plans i
do not wish to make public he put it
less gruffly the super-searchlight as i

have developed it would be too ghastly
an engine of war if some one got hold
of its secret and abused it by training it
on a body of men we could rip them to
pieces smash them to bits and now that
radium has become one of our commoner
metals there would be nothing to stop
some nation from building hundreds of
the lights and setting out to conquer the
woiid

  i apologized for my indiscreet ques-
tion to get back to your marvelous
trip i said how do you propose to get
back from alpha centauri are you
carrying one of these super-searchlights
with you

  in a sense yes he pointed to his
drawing this bulge at the lower end
of the projectile is a false bottom it is
really another gun which goes along
with the bullet on the trip out when
we wish to come home i shall point the
projectile toward earth throw the switch
that disintegrates the charge of radium in
the false bottom and we shoot earthward
with the same speed and in the same man-
ner as we shot heavenward

  how will you manage to equip a
projectile for so long atrip was my next
question even riding on a beam of
light you will need four years each way
eight years en route your space-ship
must be tremendous to carry provisions
for eight years

  ticknor smiled and again for an in-
stant brock stopped his pacing

  that brings up one of the most inter-
esting points of the trip said the great
scientist and one on which if we have
guessed wrong we shall lose our lives

  it has long been my theory that speed
and time are closely related factors or
dimensions if you want to call them
that when one travels at great speed he
begins to catch up with time man has
so far been unable to reach a speed great
rulers of the future



enough to measure its effect on time but
i believe that in our space-shell rocketing
forth into the heavens with the speed of
light we will not only catch up with time
partially-but will equal and cancel it in
other words there will be no such thing
as time at  miles a second in
that event though we will take four
years of time as we know it to reach
alpha centauri as far as we ourselves
shall be conscious of time we will get
there in about three minutes which will
be the time taken to accelerate to that
speed

   then youll be asleep for four years
not at all said ticknor a little im-
patiently we shall step into our pro-
jectile throw the switch and two or
three minutes later shall see the great disk
of alpha centauri out the bow porthole
two or three minutes to you-four
years to us i puzzled then i let it go
-and i began to despair of ever getting
this story seriously accepted by my paper

i	believed in professor ticknor and his
theories almost instinctively i knew he
and they were right but making a city
editor and a reading public believe it
was another matter

   suppose your guess about the speed
of light canceling time is wrong

   then well starve to death said tick-
nor we have only two weeks pro-
visions m the shell

tw weeks provisions for an eight-
year trip madness perhaps but a
splendid madness i thought as i sat
there gazing in growing admiration at
these two men who were about to risk
their lives how prosaic how deadly dull
did such sublime adventuring make my
own job seem

   how will you be able to stop before
you have crashed into the star youre aim-
ing at was my next question travel-

ing at that speed and with only two or
three minutes in which to act you wont
have much time to work at the controls
we wont aim at the star replied
ticknor we will aim very carefully a
degree or so to one side of the star
when we have reached that point our
speed will be decelerated for us we shall
be caught by the net of gravity of the
great globe and whirled off our course
round and round it as a satellite then
we can proceed to cruise about as we
please by means of an ordinary rocket
motor with which the shell is equipped
the purpose of your trip i prepared
to conclude this strange interview

   its purely for the purpose of scientific
research said ticknor that is on my
part he added with a glance at brock

  on my part said brock towering
before me it is for adventure alone im
sick of civilization sick of modern exist-
ence i am glad to leave earth if only for
a short time and at the risk of my neck
i dont think our young friend will be
much interested in such an opinion mur-
mured ticknor

  but i was-if not for my paper then
personally the giant had put into words
a feeling i had had many a time myself
the boredom of life as lived in the dawn
of the twenty-first century

  when do you start i asked shut-
ting my notebook

  in about four hours said ticknor
surprizingly

  so soon i had no idea-

   i didnt give permission for this inter-
view until the last moment he said
because i didnt want anything to hap-
pen to stop us so by the time your words
are in print before any misguided imbe-
ciles can get kere to prevent our going
well be on our way

  how could your trip be prevented
  ticknor shrugged pressure could be


weird tales

brought to bear by some absurd humane
society bent on stopping what they might
look on as sheer suicide also a rival of

mine a certain scientist- he stopped

and would not go on

            

ould i see the ship i asked wist-
fully

  after an instant of hesitation ticknor
nodded the three of us left the office
and went to the rear where a great con-
crete shed housed the laboratory ticknor
pointed to a gigantic mass of mechanism
in the center of the place

  the pointed nose of the space-shell
stuck out of the muzzle of the gun or
super-searchlight about twelve feet
enough to show heavy windows and a
trap-door up to which a ladder led the
whole was set on a movable standard so
that the muzzle could be raised or
lowered or swung from side to side to
point the shell

  ticknor showed me how the standard
was moved then motioned for me to
climb into the shell itself

  i got a glimpse of a tiny cabin the
walls of which were lined with metal
drawers containing heaven knew what
weird apparatus and i saw a rocket motor
that was too old a story to me to call for
investigation then in a corner i saw a
carefully packed crate

  whats in that i asked pro-
visions

  no said ticknor he stared doubt-
fully at me as if wondering whether to
answer my question then he went on
that crate contains in thick packing
one of the bits of equipment i mentioned
as being as wonderful as the space-ship
itself its a little time-machine in it is
a camera with several million feet of film
with this we shall be able to photograph

the birth and growth of the star i shall
set the machine for say a billion years in
the past while we hang over alpha cen-
tauri when it has gone back that far a
counteracting spring will be set in motion
and it will return through the eons bear-
ing visible records of the stars beginning
and career ah this trip will go down
through the ages it marks the start of
mans solution of vast problems of in-
finity and creation

  i was now beyond shock my sensibili-
ties of comprehension were numbed the
wonders of the cabin around me the
crate in which was the time-machine that
dream never before realized the fact that
ticknor had harnessed light itself to be
his driving force-all these things were
too much for my mind to grasp

  never mind i knew id give my eye-
teeth to go along

  if only i could go with you i burst
out impulsively

  ticknor merely smiled but brock
laughed shortly and his big hand clapped
me on the back in a way that nearly
knocked the wind out of me

  it will be a trip eh he said but
of course its impossible even if you real-
ly wanted to go

  i do really want to go i said again
speaking almost before i knew what i
was saying

  youre just dazzled by the thought
said brock anyway its impossible of
course utterly impossible

  and it was naturally this was none
of my affair i hardly knew the two cer-
tainly there was no reason why they
should take me along

  we went back to ticknors office
where i bade them a reluctant good-bye
and started out to the street to my giro

  but as i was leaving the office tick-
nor s servant hurried in his face was
pale and agitated
rulers of the future



  the police sir he announced they
are at the front door they demand ad-
mittance with them is professor gorse
and some other gentlemen

  brock and ticknor looked at each
other brock swore ticknors face went
as white as his servants

  gorse he said gorse

  whats wrong i asked sensing
news gorses name was almost as potent
in science as ticknors

  gorse-my deadliest rival explained
ticknor rapidly hes found out about
my projected flight before i meant him
to now hes come to prevent me taking
it and rob me of the glory

  how could he do that by what au-
thority-

  through the humanitarian league
the sort of well-intentioned fools who
rule that a man may not risk his own life
if he chooses the kind that insist on
taking care of you in spite of yourself
i was afraid of this if gorse ever gets
in that laboratory hell fix my space-shell
so itll be weeks before i can get it in
order again

  the servant tugged at his arm

  shall i admit die police sir and the
officers of the humanitarian league
ticknor gazed helplessly at brock
what shall we do

  brocks big fist smashed down on the
desk

  do do leave on our trip at once
thats what well do or try to anyhow
ticknor you go back to the lab and point
the space-shell ill hold the crowd off till
its done then ill join you-and well
shoot out into the heavens quick man
how long will you need for your calcula-
tions

  five minutes said ticknor his eyes

shining but can you all alone--

  ill help i snapped and brock and
i ran down the hall to the front door

getting there just as the police led by
gorse--who smelled a rat in the delay to
open the house to the law-started bat-
tering against the panels to break them in

the door crashed in at last and i
caught a glimpse of many men some
in police uniform and some-evidently
the humanitarian league representatives-
-in civilian clothes

  leading them was an undersized man
with thick glasses behind which were eyes
that glowed fairly green with rage and
jealousy this was gorse ticknors
rival

  gorse darted toward the hallway lead-
ing back to the laboratory without com-
ment brock plucked him up by the coat
collar and flung him back

  let me in to ticknor screeched
gorse admit me to the laboratory we
have warrants-full authority-to make
sure you and he do not take your trip
you are not to be allowed to throw your
lives away--

  bah snapped brock a lot you
care about our lives its the prestige
ticknor may get thats bothering you

  i saw him glance at the watch on his
wrist about a minute of the five tick-
nor needed for his calculations had
passed

  but now one of the policemen strode
up

   sorry sir he said but we must be
admitted to the laboratory while profes-
sor gorse officially seals your airplane or
whatever it is to stop you from killing
yourselves

   suppose i refuse to let you pass said
brock his big bulk filling the doorway
into the hall

  thn well place you under arrest
and force our way in replied the officer
i thought i saw sympathy in his eyes-
the sympathy of the man of action for


weird tales

another man of action who is being ham-
pered by some of the officious busybodies
our civilization always has with it

  a minute and a half had elapsed now
since ticknor had left for the laboratory
to prepare the shell for its launching

  act quickly pleaded gorse his
sparse hair awry theyre stalling for
time arrest them and in his anxiety
he crowded toward brock again

  this time the big man picked him up
and threw him bodily into the press of
men still crowded by the street door and
that started it

  the officer who had parleyed with
brock sprang toward him with his stick
raised to bring it down on the adventur-
ers head but brock had been expecting
the move there was a crack as his big
fist smashed into the policemans jaw
the officer sagged limply to the floor

  get him another uniformed man
spoke and four men rushed brock

  here i joined in side by side brock
and i met the four their numbers had
little to do with the outcome of the strug-
gle-for the first few seconds the two
of us retreating a few feet into the hall
filled the corridor so that only two of
them could get at us and we more than
held our own

  again i saw brock down a man with a
single blow i couldnt do quite that
well myself it took me three smashing
punches to get my man and in the mean-
time i got a bad crack on the shoulder
with the fellows stick but in about ten
seconds the first two were out of the fray
and the second two were on us

  a few more steps we gave way down
lii the corridor there were at least
twenty men in the crowd that pressed to
get at us hopeless of course if we were
fighting to beat the lot of them but we
werent all we wanted was to stand them

off till ticknor should have the shell
pointed

  the second brace of our assailants went
down-my man with a left punch knock-
ing the wind from him and a right cross
to the jaw sending him to the land of
nod brocks man under a whirlwind of
blows that i thought must tear his head
from his shoulders

  youll catch it    for this   
woodward panted brock theyll jail
you  for life

  oh no they wont i said for even
then i had a plan in mind   

  we retreated again with the crowd
after us by now the affair had passed
from a matter of forcing an official way
into ticknors laboratory and had set-
tled down to one of placing under arrest
two apparently dangerous criminals

  i saw two of the police pull their riot
guns-squat barrels with revolving cylin-
ders containing the new glass-cased para-
lyzing bullets once brock or i had one
of those bullets in us wed be out of the
world for twenty-four hours

  watch- i gasped in warning

leaping back to avoid a crashing sweep of
a hardwood stick but brock had seen
the guns drawn promptly he seized his
nearest assailant by the throat and held
him half throttled as a living shield
before his body

  no such protection was before me
however out of the corner of my eye i
saw a paralyzing gun leveled at me i
fell to the floor and heard a ping of
glass down die hall where one of the
fragile bullets had hit then brock jerk-
ing the stick from the lax hand of the
man he was throttling threw it at the
gunman it caught him in the throat he
did no more shooting

  the laboratory run for it snapped
brock to me cant face those guns
rulers of the future



  we had retreated half down the long
hallway by now some thirty feet behind
us was the heavy laboratory-door i
whirled and ran for it with brock pound-
ing at my heels and the police roaring for
us to halt

   i jerked the door open and leaped into
the great room behind it brock fol-
lowed slammed the door shut again and
shot the ponderous bolts ticknor had
equipped it with to make his scientific
secrets safe from marauders

  instantly there was a clamor from the
hall fists and sticks beat against the
door open it bellowed a voice i
recognized as belonging to the officer who
had first felt the weight of brocks fist

  brock turned toward the great shell-
mechanism i turned too and saw tick-
nor eyes blazing with concentration
bending over a calculating-chart

   one more minute ticknor said im
almost done

  he left the board and sprang to the
mechanism he spun a wheel and i saw
the whole thing shell and gun and all
slowly turn and elevate its muzzle

ticknor glanced at his chart laised
the snout of the space-ship an in-
finitesimally small distance then he
pressed a button in a column close by
the roof overhead silently parted in the
middle and slid bade to reveal the clear
sky above us

   behind us the door was resounding to
the blows battering against it the
panels were heavy and the bolts were
strong but the barrier could not hold
long under that strain

   its set to be fired in eighty seconds
ticknor rapped out get in brock
hurry

  he set the example by darting up the
ladder and in through the door of the

space-ship brock ran after him and i
-i followed brock

   i tumbled into the door so close behind
him that he hadnt a chance of shutting
me out even if hed been prepared for
the move

  what- he began

  im going along i said fumbling
for the lever that swung the trap-door
shut and hermetically sealed it

  you cant we wont permit-

   forty seconds left rapped out tick-
nor who was gazing through a cabin win-
dow at a chronometer on the laboratory
wall glancing through the same win-
dow i could see the laboratory door
buckle in the middle as it was charged
from the hall we could hear no sound
in the shell but it was obvious that the
panels wouldnt stand much more such
treatment

  get out i say roared brock its
your last chance i dont want to have to
throw you out

  i tell you im going along i said
id got the door shut by now and was
striving amateurishly to lock it as ticknor
had showed me how

  you young fool but acceptance-
and something like friendship-gleamed
in brocks cool blue eyes come then
if you want to risk your neck

   seal that door

   like a bugle call ticknors voice rang
out his hand was on the heavy copper
switch set in the control board beads of
sweat were on his forehead

  through the window we saw the lab-
oratory door strain inward once more
and then ticknors hand slammed the
big switch home

  there was a flood of light that was
dazzling clear through the double walls
of the shell i heard a soft puff of sound
then i knew no more


weird tales

a

it seemed only a fraction of a second
that consciousness was clicked off if
it was clicked off i wasnt sure whether
i had been unconscious or simply in a
complete mental turmoil for an instant

  at any rate i was conscious now and
i picked myself up off the floor gazing
dazedly about me

  heljo said brock shaking himself
like a big dog you all right wood-
ward professor

  all right said ticknor blinking
and i nodded

  the three of us gazed still rather
densely at each other

  ticknor and i were in the direct path
of light beating fiercely in at the port
window brock was half in and half out
of the beam from the waist up he was
fa intense daylight the legs of him were
in deep night

  it was the queerest sunlight i ever saw
-like a straight beam from a searchlight
it poured in the window and the shadow
next to the sharp outline of its path was
utterly unrelieved solid black

  but then i remembered this wasnt
sunlight-it was alpha centauri-light

  our trip then was over in that little
dick of time four years had passed even
as ticknor had said it would be our jour-
ney had been completed almost before we
knew it had started

  well said ticknor shakily were
here

  commonplace words but there were
no words big enough to describe what
had happened an instant ago to our
consciousness at any rate we had been oa
earth annoyed by police and the humani-
tarian league now we were out in the
immensity of space circling about in a
thin metal shell no language is de-
signed to express such filings

  ticknor reached into one of the com-
partments lining the walls and got out
heavily smoked squares of glass he
handed us each one and we stepped to
the window to look out at the blazing
globe we had so miraculously reached

  how can i tell adequately of the next
few moments how can i describe our
emotions as we slowly realized what had
happened - the fantastic unbelievable
thing that had occurred

  we pressed close to the port window
gazing with all our eyes at the flaming
mass some scores of millions of miles
away

  it looked the size of a dinner plate
from the distance where the net of its
gravity had slowed our light-speed it
was golden yellow we could almost see
its surface seethe with the immense in-
ternal heat of its mass there were queer
spots on it evidently cooler places and

altogether it resembled-

  strange i heard ticknor mutter
strange this yellow color-that is not
the color i had expected to find

  he looked yet more intently

  then brock spoke up it looks exact-
ly like our own sun doesnt it

  it does said ticknor still with that
baffled note in his voice sun spots and
all   

  i could only stare at the great golden
plate and try to remember where we were
out in the heavens   

  are all the stars exact duplicates of
our own sun save for difference in size
mused ticknor aloud but that cant be
the colors some are white some blue-

white and some orange-

  at that moment he was interrupted by
brocks excited cry

  professor look below a satellite
and the damned thing looks exactly like
earth

  at that we all pressed our cheeks to
rulers of the future

u

the glass to look down at as sharp an
angle as possible and the next instant
we all stared dumfoundedly at each other
-to press close to the glass again and
peer down at that amazing satellite

  even i as a layman utterly unversed in
things scientific or astronomic could get
the astounding resemblance

  there below us swam in space an ice-
white ball mottled with occasional green
spots that looked remarkably like earth
slightly different it was but not much
from the atlas i had studied in classroom
days

  there was a long stretch of land
sheathed in white spreading toward the
upper pole that was the continents of
africa and eurasia to the life and across
a huge stretch of plain that must be a sea
were two continents-also sheathed in
white for the most part that certainly
seemed to be north and south america

  but the atlantic ocean has grown i
mumbled involuntarily speaking in
earth-terms of this odd satellite that
means the pacific if we could see it
around the bend of the globe must be
cut in half

  continental drift replied ticknor
and as i gazed at him in astonishment for
an instant i could see the pulse in his
throat pounding heavily

  the white coating spoke up brock
his heavy voice vibrating what is it
ice said ticknor glaciers spread-
ing from pole to pole and leaving oases
of green fruitful land here and there
so much like earth except for that
too-wide atlantic and the glaciers
whispered brock

  and then ticknor straightened up from
the window and stood before us a little
man with mild gray-green eyes inclined
to rotundity commonplace-looking and
yet somehow stamped with all the in-

domitability that makes the human race
what it is

  gentlemen he said let us not de-
ceive ourselves any longer you know i
think what i am about to tell you

i believe we did know-only the con-
scious mind always strives to stave off
admitting as fact a truth that is repulsive
but we waited to hear him put it into
words

  the blazing ball off yonder not only
looks like our own sun it is the sun
and the satellite below us is our own

earth

  i felt my heart constrict as though a
fist had clutched it for i felt-i knew-
that some fearful revelation was yet to
come from the awed-looking little scien-
tist who stood so straight before us and
i saw brock tense his powerful body as if
to receive a blow

  my calculations when i aimed the
shell at alpha centauri were made too
hastily ticknor went on thanks to
gcrse and his meddling we missed our
target-how narrowly i dont know but
enough as a result we have traveled
clear around the universe-to return to
our starting-point einstein was right a
beam of light traveling in a straight line
as we know it eventually circumnavigates
the entire universe and comes back to the
point of its beginning

  but-good heaven half whispered
brock if it is four light-years from

earth to alpha centauri- he could

not finish the sentence

  ticknor nodded how long it takes
a ray of light to go dear around the uni-
verse no one can even guess a hundred
million years two hundred million i
dont know but whatever the fime re-
quired-that is the time that has elapsed
since we left my laboratory in capetown
bound for alpha centauri


weird tales

  and there we had it-the news we had
partly guessed already and refused to ad-
mit to ourselves-news so momentous
that it took days for the full realization
of it to be grasped by our minds

  in that little click of elapsed time that
had occurred immediately after our start
hundreds of millions of earth-years had
reeled by

  and we-we were back where we had
started from our own planet - but
separated from our own true world by a
gulf of uncountable eons exiled in the
future two hundred million years away
from earth as we knew it

  i moistened my lips how are we
going to get back i said at last and
brock hung on the professors reply as
desperately as i did

  we arent said ticknor slowly un-
less-

  he swung around to gaze into the cor-
ner of the cabin at the crate in which
was packed that marvel-the little time-
machine

  in that lies our only salvation it is a
crude little thing and i have no way of
checking its accuracy but using it as a
model i may be able to build a machine
large enough to carry the three of us back
over the years to  again

  then were saved began brock but
ticknor held up his hand

  to build such a machine i must have
all the laboratory facilities i had in my
own shop that presupposes that there
are now on earth people as intelligent and
as scientifically advanced as only a few
were in our own time we do not know
that we will find such people when we
descend to earth we dont know what
well find-what forms of life have
evolved in the unguessable millions of
years that have passed since we left here
perhaps there is no life at all the glaciers
may have killed every living thing per-

haps strange monsters roam the world
again as they did in our own prehistoric
times

  there was silence then while our stag-
gered brains tried to comprehend it all

  god i cant believe it said brock
finally two hundred million years or
so-gone in the wink of an eye

  as for me i was speechless i could
only stare now and then at that weird
planet beneath us that was earth but
which with its glacial sheets and strange-
ly altered oceans did not seem like earth

  then the man of action took command
brocks heavy jaw set and his great
shoulders went back

  well accomplish nothing up here in
the heavens he said crisply i move
we descend at once and set about our
only chance of salvation-the building of
another time-machine

  so ticknor went to the controls while
brock and i remained at the window

the professor switched on the auxil-
iary rocket-motor with which the
shell was equipped and we began to
streak downward-at a snails pace com-
pared to our interstellar speed but still
at a distance-devouring clip

  we wanted to land in some spot where
morning was in swing it might be sui-
cidal to come to rest in the darkness of
night not having the faintest notion what
kind of inhabitants now ruled earth

  such a spot chanced to be in north
africa where the sahara desert had
been in the dim far past from which we
had traveled

  there as we got to within a few thou-
sand miles of the ground we saw two
green dots in the vast expanse of solid
glacial ice that seemed to have coated
nearly all the world the larger of the
two dots was probably five hundred miles
across the smaller about two hundred
rulers of the future



btft from our distance they looked like a
green dime set down on a rounded sur-
face beside a green quarter

  we made for the larger circle once
desert now one of the few fruitful spots
still left unconquered by the great ice
sheets

  in the glare of the early morning sun
we settled down and now ticknor set
die controls so that he could join us in
watching the unfolding details of this
new earth of ours

  the circle spread and spread as we
neared it just before the surrounding
glacial sheets had faded from sight on
every side we saw tiny ridges at their
edges that were in reality great hills
debris of earth and rock dropped by the
glaciers-which indicated that we had
come toward the end of this latest glacial
age

  thirty or forty thousand years from
now there may be no more ice on earth
than the normal amount at the poles
said ticknor

  but we cant wait that long said
brock with a mirthless grin and if
there arent remnants of a superior civili-
zation left in this oasis or in another like
it somewhere-

  therell be no time-machine built
and well live and die several hundred
million years out of our own era tick-
nor finished for him then i see no
signs of a city or even a village

  nor was there one in the center of the
five-hundred-mile circle was a big area
dotted with odd green mounds like moss-
grown shells of enormous turtles but
these of course must be only oddly
shaped natural hills

  now we saw that the whole region
was threaded with rivers and creeks and
that every few miles a small lake sat like
a jewel in the greenery surplus water
from the glaciers as they slowly melted

  we got close enough to see that the
entire region was thickly wooded with
only here and there pasture-like spaces
heavily carpeted with what must be grass
and still we saw no sign of any living
thing and no sign of a human habitation

  the last man on earth how often
one jokingly uses that phrase was that
to be our fate were we going to die
slowly through weeks of starvation on an
ice-coated planet the last men on earth

  but its warm here brock muttered
the trees and grass show that the sun
overcomes the chill of the surrounding
ice or not even vegetation could live
well find food of some sort

  the vegetation may be of a sort that
can stand immense cold said ticknor
it may be of a type we knew nothing of
millions of years ago

  but the trees as we hovered over them
certainly looked much like our own
there was more branch and trunk and
less leaf the leaves themselves were larg-
er and thicker but otherwise they were
trees of our own time and of our own
temperate zone we took hope from that

  and then ticknor stepped to the con-
trols and with a little jar we landed
beside a small lake



each of us drew a long breath and
stared around the close confines of
the tiny cabin we had landed but we
were reluctant to leave the space-shell in
it at least was a measure of security
outside in the thickly wooded oasis in
the glacial sheet anything might happen

  well each load ourselves with weap-
ons said brock a rifle and an auto-
matic apiece    why whats wrong
professor

  with his words  whirled to look at
the stocky little scientist
ticknor had gone pale


weird tales

  we-we have no arms he faltered
at fast we left so suddenly  i had
meant to fill the racks but there was no

time-

  no guns exclaimed brock running
his big fingers through his shock of yel-
low hair good heaven

  ticknor caught his arm but brock
-you must have an automatic ive neve
known you to be without one

  brock shook his head this is the ex-
ception to the rule i have no gun with
rne

  here i readied into my pocket i with-
drew my own automatic a weapon 
usually carried as protection against the
giro bandits that infested the air over the
outskirts of every large city

  the eyes of brock and tidcnoi
gleamed as they fdl on the weapon

  thank god said brock we have
at least one gun

  we have a gun i said but we have
nothing to put in it

 you mean-

  i mean that in this gun there is one
bullet just one when thats gone were
through i cleaned it day before yesterday
-i mean a couple of hundred million
years ago-and neglected to put the clip
back in

  brock swore in a disappointment no
more bitter than my own it was seldom
i carried that gun without its clip of four-
teen shots in the grip and fate had
selected this time with diabolical pre-
rision as one of those few occasions

  one bullet true the automatic was a
late model shooting the new trinitele ex-
plosive bullet one of them could blow
an elephant to bits

  but-one bullet if anything attacked
us in numbers   

  youd better carry it i said to brock
youre no doubt a better marksman than
lam

  he nodded probably ive handled
guns all my life well lets get out and
stretch our legs

  ticknor eased open the heavy door of
the space-shell for an instant we hesi-
tated wondering if the air would be
breathable to our andent form of lungs
wondering if the temperature was as tem-
perate as the look of the trees indicated
or far below zero

  we all sighed with relief as both ques-
tions were satisfactorily answered

  the air was warm about like the air
of a late spring day in old new york
and it was breathable it was a little thin
-earth had lost some of its atmosphere
through the eons-but it was perfectly
life-sustaining

we jumped to the ground finding
it soft and spongy to the feet
moisture from the surrounding glaciers
evidently underlay the entire five-hun-
dred mile oasis making the earth almost
bog-like and rich as delta-iand

  now where i asked instinctively
looking to brock ticknor was the man
of brains but brock was by nature the
leader in anything concerning practical
action

  the big man nodded toward a tongue
of woods that stretched out from the main
forest toward us

  if there are any humans here theyll
probably be in the thickets perhaps hid-
ing from us in fear but we must be
ready to run for the ship at a moments
notice thats our fortress now

  we followed him toward the thicket
of trees leaving the silver sheet of the
little lake behind us strange figures we
must have been moving through that
wild and deserted-seeming landscape
dressed in the sober garb of the twenty-
first century

  on the edge of the forest we soon saw
rulers of the future



one lone tree that was different from any
of the others and since we had no defi-
nite destination almost unconsciously we
walked toward that

  the tree was not as large as some of
the more familiar-looking forest giants
near it but what it lacked in size it made
up in color it was aflame with purple
blossoms -- great cup-shaped flowers
almost like tulip blooms and trunk and
branches were deep dark almost sinister-
looking purple

  vodd-looking thing muttered brock
as we walked toward it but the remark
was abstracted all of us were too busy
looking for signs of animate life to waste
much thought on trees

  we reached the tree without having
seen a moving thing and we paused
under the purple branches-beneath them
there was no underbrush to impede the
feet-to talk over what we would do
next

  shall we go farther into this dark
forest in the hope of finding people
brock put the question or shall we
try to cruise low in the space-shell over the
area-whats the matter woodward

   i had been sniffing the air sharply
lets get away from this tree i said
those purple flowers look handsome
but they smell like death itself

  well go along in a moment the
question is which way shall we travel
if we take to the shell argued tick-
nor we might soar the country for a
week and never see a soul-because if
there are humans here they may well be
frightened by the ship

  unless theyre enlightened beings
said brock hopefully then he glanced
curiously up at the tree branches above
us say-thats queer these branches
are moving and there isnt a breath of air
to stir them

                   

  and just at that instant the arboreal
trap was sprung

  run i choked leaping away from
the sinister purplish bole

  but i was too late-as were the others
down around us like a purple web
drooped the lower tree branches like
hungry purple mouths the budding
flowers yawned toward us whip-like
tendrils caught and clung at our legs our
arms our bodies

  help- i choked

  but brock and ticknor were in peril
as deadly as my own it was every man
to take care of himself

  the purple tree was rocking as though
a gale of wind tossed it now the ten-
drils crawled like tilings of flesh over our
bodies to be followed by thicker more
powerful branches

  i heard brock panting and shouting as
he sought with his great hands to tear
loose from the clutching branches i felt
one of the horrible purple blooms press
avidly to my throat

  whatever those blooms looked like
they were not flowers they were tough
as leather hardy as rubber and like a
rubber suction disk the flower at my
throat flattened against my flesh-and
held there

  i caught a whirling jumble of blue sky
through a purple web of tossing branches
as i was whipped off my feet then a
branch as thick as my thumb coiled
around my throat and the world went
black   

  painfully long later i struggled back
to consciousness and for a dreamy in-
stant in a half-world of fancy i thought
i was back in my own age for i thought
i heard human voices

  but that of course was fantastic i
realized it a moment later as fuller con-
sciousness returned i opened my eyes
with an effort and sat up and then a


weird tales

cry of wonder burst from my lacerated
throat

  i had heard human speech for all
around me-and around the still motion-
less bodies of brock and ticknor-was
a ring of creatures that were undeniably
human beings

there were about two hundred of
them as human as the races we
knew and seemingly as intelligent their
eyes were clear and contemplative and
they had good broad foreheads they
were a shade less than our average
height about five feet six i should say
their color was very light lighter even
than the fairness of brocks skin and he
is pure blond

  not very advanced in civilization
though i mused thinking of ticknors
hope that we would find a race advanced
scientifically

  they were dressed in some simple gar-
ment of coarse fabric that left arms bare
and came down to the knee decidedly a
primitive costume on the other hand
their bare heads were neatly trimmed as
to hair and the women who were as tall
as the men and in most cases slightly bet-
ter muscled even wore simple but taste
ful ornaments of colored bark in their
tresses	

  they were a gentle-looking folk these
people that had rescued us from the tree
of death they had wide soft eyes in
which no ferocity lay--but in the depths
of which there seemed to rest in every

case an abiding terror-

  of what we were later to find out
they looked cowed spirit-broken a
fine people in bondage to something
loathsome and horrible crushed down
through generations until they had be-
come gentie almost spiritless creatures in
whose liquid eyes blended docility and
awful fear

  yet they could not be a cowardly race
since they had somehow by sheer press
of numbers managed to rob the purple
tree of our lives

  such were some of the thoughts that
passed confusedly through my mind as
the woods people chattered about us in
an alien tongue then brock and tick-
nor stirred and sat up and the humans
pressed nearer to us

  i could see mirrored in my comrades
faces all the thoughts that had been mine
then brock said impulsively in english
hello

  an instant later we all smiled ruefully
english how many hundreds of mil-
lions of years ago had the english lan-
guage been forgotten

  now our gentle shyly inquisitive res-
cuers came nearer glancing first at us and
then back at our space-shell which could
barely be seen through the intervening
pattern of trees

  one of them a girl seemed either
bolder or more trusting than the rest she
came up to within a few yards of us
smiled and said something in a fluid
beautiful voice words of course that
were no more intelligible to us than so
many syllables in old phenician would
have been

  we got up from the ground then all
of us a bit shaky but otherwise none the
worse for our experience with the car-
nivorous tree

  i can shut my eyes and see the picture
that girl made now with the green for-
est making a background for her light
beauty as she stood in the little clearing
only a few yards from the purple tree
trying to make us understand what she
was talking about

  she was lovely as exquisitely shaped as
a wood sprite with ash-blond hair in
which was a dark blue wood-flower braid-
ed over her left ear and dark rich brown
rulers of the future



eyes in almost shocking contrast to her
white skin and silky nearly white hair

  my eyes must have revealed my
thoughts for she colored a little and her
clear accents faltered the next instant
though she edged ever so little nearer to
me than to the others then with won-
der in her lovely dark eyes she reached
out a slim hand to feel curiously of the
brown tweed of my coat

   at this the rest of the crowd packed us
in in a dense circle and commenced their
strange talking again

   the devil growled brock this is
getting us nowhere weve got to find
some way of communicating with them
here my little beauty with the blue
wood-flower in her hair solved the prob-
lem she had been pressed closer to me
in the crowding of the others and now
she tugged at my arm

   as i looked at her she pointed first to
us then back at the space-shell and then
up into the clear blue heavens

   i didnt get it at first so she repeated
the gesture then i understood

   she wants to know what wed like to
do-if we intend to fly away as we came
i said what will we tell her

   that we want to go with them said
ticknor eagerly these people couldnt
possibly have the equipment i need to
build a time-machine but-we mustnt
overlook any chances

   i turned to the girl i pointed to our-
selves to the multitude of gentle little
folk standing around and then toward
the heart of the forest

   her eyes lit up she cried something in
her soft voice the forest dwellers smiled
hospitably and waved their bare arms

   the girl took my hand and the four of
us started toward the denser woods with
the rest straggling out into single files as
we left the small clearing one look we
sent behind to the space-shell then we set
w t-

our faces to the fore and plodded on to
where our hosts-or captors as their
numbers would make them if they wished
-had their dwelling-place

  a bizarre tribe living in bizarre sur-
roundings in an age millions of centuries
beyond our own what would be our lot
with them



for a month we lived with these sim-
ple kindly people in the wilderness
village they led us to

  it was not much of a village and their
existence was extremely uncomplicated
but what little they had they seemed glad
to share with us

  during that month we learned many
things about the strange new earth to
which we had come after circling the
universe we learned these things by
first learning the language of the people

  when your life hangs on it you can
learn a lot in a short time in three
weeks we had picked up more than the
rudiments of their tongue we were
helped in this by the fact that their lan-
guage was simple clear and composed of
only a few thousand words it seemed
indeed like the clarified simplified dregs
of a language that once must have been
voluminous and intricate

  at the end of the third week the girl
with the blue flower and i walked alone
in the forest since she had been the first
to approach us and perhaps because she
was considered unusually intelligent she
had been assigned us as teacher but
after every class she and i were ac-
customed to strolling off together through
the woods

  i was getting on pretty well with the
language for a thick-headed ex-news-
paper reporter well enough to under-
stand at last a fractional part of the warn-
ing that i have no doubt shed been try-


weird tales

ing to give us since first we mastered a
few words of their tongue

  in the weeks before that walk in the
woods we had noticed many things one
was the contrast between the undoubted
brain capacity of these people and the
almost primitive way they lived

  their only shelters were thatched bark
huts in which whole families huddled in
a single small enclosure their only gar-
ments were the coarse knee-length tunics
which were woven of strands pounded
out of a certain bark

  they lived on a few vegetables that
were unknown to us and were only
crudely cultivated and on fish which
swarmed in the countless brooks and in
the lake beside which we had left the
shell they hadnt any tools-not even
stone axes-which accounted for the fact
that they did not chop down the deadly
purple trees

  yet they certainly seemed competent
enough to build a better civilization for
themselves if left alone if left alone it
soon became evident to us that they did
not build better or try to live more com-
fortably because of the fear-of some
mysterious thing-that showed always in
their soft dark eyes

  more and more plainly as day slipped
after day in this seeming eden in the ice
fields we came to realize that the keynote
of their lives was that fear and we
noticed too that the fear seemed to be
growing with each passing day the peo-
ple of the woods began to slink about
gazing now and then over their shoulders
as though they feared pursuit and
always they gazed in the same direction-
to the north toward the center of the
circle that made up their universe

  even the girl with the blue flower i
never saw her without a fresh bloom
twined in her silky light hair reacted in
the same general way in the midst of the

most light-hearted moment she would
stop laughing at some blunder of lan-
guage i had made-and suddenly into
her eyes would spring a very frenzy of
terror

  as the fourth week slipped along the
people had begun to act like a demented
race the tension in the air became a
thing almost to be felt physically and
the girl-gayta i found was her name-
started and trembled every time she heard
a twig snap in the forest

   and on that day toward the end of the
fourth week i got some slight hint as to
the reason for all this nervous tension

   gayta i started by saying is it very
cold here part of the time

  when she had grasped the meaning of
my broken ungrammatical attempt at her
language she shook her head

  no why

  i asked because i see your people
stocking up big stores of fish from the
lake-more than they could ever eat i
thought perhaps it was because the lakes
and rivers became as the great white
hardness around us so that the fish
might not be caught

  it is always the same here she re-
plied not warmer not colder

  then why are the fish stored up

  she avoided my eye i saw of a sud-
den that she was trembling

  why i persisted

  it is for them she whispered at
last every thirty-five times the bohga
sun swings across the skies they come
to collect the stores of fish

for the rest of the afternoon i wrestled
with the language problem as gayta
tried to tell me precisely what was wrong
and at the conclusion of our talk i hur-
ried to seek out ticknor and brock

   they were in the hut that had been as-
signed to them trying their hand at a
rulers of the future



new way of broiling the fish that was the
main staple of diet ticknor had burned
his fingers and brock was grinning at
him--

  as i look back now i see how re-
markably contented we were becoming
with this simple life among these likable
people to ourselves we had admitted
after the first few days that it would be
impossible to build a time-machine with
any materials or equipment we could con-
trive among these beings but less and
less did the thought bother us

   i burst into the hut full of the things
i had learned-vaguely but alarmingly-
from gayta

  woodward said ticknor dropping
his fish into the fire at my expression

  what the devil said brock rising
and filling the hut with his bulk youre
white as a ghost whats up

  so i told them what i had learned
from gayta

  tve found out what it is that hangs
over the heads of these people i began
the thing that keeps them from trying
to climb out of this primitive way of liv-
ing-the thing that fills their eyes and
their lives with that unholy fear

  theyre an enslaved race even as we
have guessed and they are enslaved by
something powerful and terrible it is for
their masters that they live it is for them
that they fish the streams and lakes so
continually and lay up these great sur-
plus stores of cured fish we have noticed

  once every thirty-five days the mas-
ters send some of their number to collect
the food this is taken back to their own

city-

  gty interrupted brock swiftly
what city we saw no city when we
dropped into this place

   their city is the big collection of
greenish mounds we saw in the center of
the oasis i told him i cant imagine

what kind of dwelling-places they are
but thats beside the point

  the masters collect this food every
thirty-five days regularly i got the idea
that they sometimes collect other food
too-of a cannibalistic sort but i cant
be sure of that anyway they take the
stock home with them and there follows
a five-days feast-a sort of festival they
gorge themselves on fish-and perhaps
on the flesh of a few slaves-and they
worship and make sacrifices to their god
then there follows a period of thirty days
during which as far as i could get from
gaytas talk they do nothing at all they
hibernate perhaps or go into some state
of lethargy-

   impossible brock interrupted again
what kind of people could it be that fed
only once a month and that slept or went
into a coma for the following four
weeks

   i dont know that they are people
i answered and i think my face got a
little whiter gaytas horror of the situa-
tion she was trying to tell me about had
been very contagious gaytas word to
describe them was the one she has been
using to denote things she just kept
saying the things are coming they
will take the food we have gathered-
and one of our number perhaps for sac-
rifice to their god that we never know
sometimes long long seasons pass and
they take no one for sacrifice-sometimes
they take one from us two times in suc-
cession 

  and they come here about once a
month repeated ticknor

  yes we happened to land here just
a few days after their last visit

  but i say protested brock there
arent more than two hundred and fifty
people here if these masters sacrifice
them to their gods or eat them now and
then the slaves wouldnt last very long


weird tales

  it seems there are thousands of other
humans in the oasis i told him gayta
made me understand that there are many
other such villages in the woods as this
but they are kept scattered and forbid-
den to communicate with one another
brock nodded i suppose thats to
keep down rebellion the ruling powers
seem to have no mean order of intelli-
gence but-if theyre as tyrannical as
gayta says why hasnt there been revolt
anyhow are the masters so numerous
there are less than three hundred of
them

 then why-

   its because of their god i told him
this god of theirs appears to be a
strange and powerful creation it is sup-
posed to be able to read minds when
any man gets desperate and starts plan-
ning rebellion the god reads that mans
thoughts-and he is promptly put to
death in the temple so for some decades
no revolt has flourished

  you couldnt make out just what the
masters are like persisted brock

  i could not they are an alien race
-that much at least i could pick up

they came here ages ago-

   across the ice fields

  no the glaciers are impassable as
near as i could make out from gaytas
words and gestures some upheaval of
nature-perhaps an earthquake-split a
ragged path in the ice from here to the
smaller oasis near by-the one we noticed
as we came down this race lived in that
other oasis they had fished out the
waters and hunted out the woods and
they came here en masse they found
gaytas ancestors and fat hunting and
fishing so they enslaved the people and
have been living here ever since

but what are they burst in ticknor
i tell you i dont know gayta didnt
speak of them as people and when she

tried precise descriptions i got lost in a
fog of strange words

  their next visit here is soon said
brock

  damn soon in the next few days

well we talked that over for some
time should we try to hide from
the things during the days of their ac-
tivity but as brock pointed out we
couldnt hide the space-shell and be-
sides if we didnt get caught this time
we would the next time or the one after
that

  should we get into the space-ship and
use the rocket motor to find some other
island in the ice where conditions might
be less doubtful brock and i rather
thought this was the thing to do but
ticknor was dead set against it

  youre forgetting our main purpose
in life just now to build a machine that
will carry us back to our own century
these people here are in no position to
help us the- havent even steel-let
alone the more complicated alloys i need
but their rulers are obviously a superior
race if we can make friends with them
we might find that they have at least
some of the equipment and materials we
need

  and if we cant make friends with
them said brock

  lets take that chance when it comes
said ticknor with a shrug i cant be-
lieve theyre as ruthless as these folk
make out the woods people are nice
but theyre not long on reckless courage

  but i wouldnt call them cowards
either said brock and man woman
and child they are petrified with fear of
the beings they slave for that doesnt
sound as though there were much chance
of making friends with them

  but ticknors argument that we might
somehow find opportunity with them to
rulers of the future



build a machine that would carry us back
across the thousands of centuries to our
own era prevailed over our objections

  with mingled hope and misgivings we
waited for the things as gayta called
them to come for their monthly rations
we made our way through the dark for-
est to the space-shell on the side of the
lake however we would sleep in it that
night and stay close to it until the rulers
came then if we didnt like their looks
we could soar away from them to some
other place

  they cant be so inhuman as theyre
made out to be said ticknor as we
climbed into the shell for our nights rest
our woods friends are too easily fright-
ened he added for the dozenth time

   but i wasnt so sure of that myself the
look of frozen horror in gaytas eyes  

  the things came next day



next day dawned mild and clear-
as every day had since wed come

  earth in the hundreds of millions of
years seemed to have gotten a better cli-
mate instead of a worse the sun if any
cooler at all was not perceptibly so it
hung in the clear blue heavens as brilliant
and warm as it had over our world back
in c by first-hand observation we
were able to give the lie to those scien-
tists who insisted that the sun was rapidly
dying the ice fields as i have said
were melting they were but one of the
recurrent glacial epochs which for no rea-
son that any one knows came and went
on earth even before our own day

   for some time on that fateful morning
we kept to the shell indeed we kept the
door sealed too ready to ascend instantly
if need be while the three of us stood
watch at the windows looking onto the
forest we wanted to see what the rulers

of gaytas people looked like before
trusting ourselves to their mercies

  the hours crawled past however and
there was no sign of any visitors we
began to get restless in the narrow con-
fines of the cabin breathing our artificial
air when the sun beckoned outside

  we cant stay in here for ever
growled brock at last and we dont
even know if the-the things-are com-
ing today they might not get here till
tomorrow lets get outside and wait we
can stay near the shell

  ticknor and i were ready enough to
agree so we opened the hermetically
sealed door after a cautious look around
and stepped outside

  the day was even finer than it had
seemed to us from the inside looking out

   it was like a day in late spring warm
and bland but with a faint undercurrent
of chill from the unbroken expanses of
glacial ice stretching away on every side
we could imagine that if any winds
blew the green oasis in the ice would be
miserably cold but not once in the time
wed been there had there been even a
breeze so we could only guess about it

  immediately behind us was the tiny
lake blue as sapphire under the radiant
sun before and to either side of us
stretched the emerald green forest lands

  not a bad place brock rumbled
arching his great chest in the thin pure
air come on lets stretch our legs
we ought to keep near the shell
said ticknor

  we can go toward the woods theres
nothing but the lake behind us and no-
body can approach from that direction
so we strolled a few yards away from
the little ship toward the forests and
as we went we kept an alert lookout for
movement from the woods ready to race
back to the shell with the first appearance
of anything strange


weird tales

we had gone perhaps fifty yards
and were about ready to walk
back when i had a peculiar premonition
that all was not well

  there had been no movement either
ahead of us or to right or left but just
the same i had a hunch as my grand-
father used to call it

  i turned about to look back at the
shell   

  with my heart sinking in my chest i
blinked to be sure i was really seeing cor-
rectly and not suffering from some hid-
eous optical illusion then i caught at
brock and ticknor and wordlessly point-
ed toward the shell

  good heaven whispered brock all
color draining from under the tan of his
face

  ticknor said nothing-just stared with
wide and unbelieving eyes but i saw
him moisten his lips with his tongue i
even thought to hear that tongues dry
rasp in the frozen silence that bound us

  drawn up in line before the space-
shell cutting us off from the open metal
door were a dozen of the things gayta
had tried to describe to me-the enslavers
of her people and the superior beings
ticknor had tentatively thought we might
make friends with i can still laugh
mirthlessly when i think of that phrase
they were monstrous-in appearance as
well as in size

  ten feet high they were with cylin-
drical bodies two feet through and vary-
ing in size hardly at all from their thick
necks to their blunt tails which almost
dragged on the ground between the short
massive legs on which they stood erect
their arms had plainly not many mil-
lions of years back been forelegs they
were now long powerful triple-jointed
limbs with four-fingered hands tipped
with long claws

  set atop the columnar necks were re-

pulsive heads with great long jaws pits
for nostrils and neither ears nor trace of
foreheads crocodilian heads they were

  crocodilian it is the exact word to
describe them imagine if you can a
short-tailed blunt-nosed crocodile walk-
ing on its hind legs and using its fore-
legs-elongated super-developed and
prehensile-as arms and you have a fair
picture of the things that stared un-
blinkingly at us as they towered in a line
between us and the metal hull that was
our only haven

  the reptilian impression was increased
when we stared into those cold unblink-
ing eyes lizard eyes they were without
a doubt and yet in them were glints of
ample intelligence cold-blooded life
had crawled up the scale of evolution in
the countless ages of our circuit of the
universe what had resulted was neither
lizard nor man-but lizard-men

  good heaven brock breathed again
then how    how did the things
manage to cut us off ill swear they
didnt come from the forests  

  the question answered itself the
silent glaring monsters were still drip-
ping they had come on us from behind
over-or possibly under-the waters of
the lake

  impulsively brocks hand whipped
down for the gun that was our sole
weapon but reluctantly it moved away
again just one bullet in its barrel-and
twelve or fourteen of the ten-foot lizard-
men ranged against us in addition their
unclad bodies were covered with homy-
looking scales a shot would have to hit
its target squarely not to glance off the
cylindrical scale-armored bodies

  got to save that bullet muttered
brock but what in heavens name are
we going to do

  neither ticknor nor i tried to answer
the question anyhow it seemed to me
rulers of the future



just then that a more important question
was-what were they going to do

  the lizaxd-men must know we were
not of their slaves we were taller than
the gentle forest folk-brock by nearly
a foot-and our ridiculous-looking 
garments stamped us as of an alien race

  but for a few seconds longer they did
nothing-simply stood there slowly mov-
ing their crocodile jaws and glaring at us
out of their pale cold crocodile eyes
while we stood rigid and stared back
feeling the very hair on our scalps crawl
with loathing and horror

  then the line of lizard-men moved
one of them the tallest of the lot began
to stump on his short tree-trunks of legs
-toward the open shell door

  charge them roared brock his face
chalk-white we cant let them get in
there

  stung from our paralysis of fright we
raced toward the shell-and toward the
menacing lizard-men mad of course
we were stark mad for a moment as we
visioned the damage the things might do
to our shell our space-shell the only
avenue of escape we had

  and so we charged those towering hor-
rors that outnumbered us six to one and
seeming stupefied by our rashness they
waited motionless while we covered the
few yards intervening between us

  but we were not entirely insane we
raced toward the lizard-men in a v with
brock at the point if we could manage
to rip through their line and get into the
shell--

  again i have to laugh mirthlessly as
i think of that absurd hope the lizard-
men looked slow and clumsy but i have
never seen anything move so swiftly as
they moved then

  till we had almost reached them they
stayed motionless then like darting
tongues of light the long arms of two of

them shot out to bar us from the open
door of the space-ship

  brock hunched his great shoulders and
plunged against the barrier of their arms
they gave a little stiffened then tossed
him back as if he had been a child simi-
larly they caught and thrust back ticknor
and me

  brock picked up a tree-branch his hand
fell on as he rolled on the soft turf with
a bellow he charged again swinging his
ponderous club as though it had weighed
no more than a straw

  it crashed with a loud crack against
the upflung arm of the nearest lizard-
man the arm went limp into the pale
cold eyes came an opalescent greenish fire
the uninjured arm shot out the four-
fingered hand caught brock by the shoul-
der plucked him up and threw him
bodily twenty feet away

  hopeless hopeless but we battered
insanely at the ten-foot things with fists
and feet and stones as well die in action
as more slowly at a later hour

my flesh still creeps as i remember
the contact of my fists with that
cold and armored hide-and the mount-
ing glare of wrath in their green-flaming
eyes

  and yet they didnt kill us incredible
-except that the near future was to tell
us horribly why

  finally the lizard-men themselves
charged and two to each of us caught us
in those great long arms and held us
powerless in strands of cold living
gristle and powerless with death in our
hearts we stood and watched the rest of
them move about their course of meth-
odical and devilishly intelligent destruc-
tion

  the towering leader of the lizard-men
entered the shell as he had started to do
when we charged we heard him croak


weird tales

something-saw two of the others stump

in to join him-

  they even talk gasped ticknor
they did it was impossible not to
admit that the croaking utterances we
heard among the three in the shell were
ordered sentences

  then we heard crash after crash saw
through the near window the immense
forms of the lizard-men bent almost dou-
ble in the cramped cabin as they pulled
out drawer after drawer and demolished
the instruments and equipment they con-
tained

  the time-machine whispered tick-
nor his lips a white streak in his pallid
face the time-machine

  that carefully padded crate would
they find that and smash it it was not
in a position for us to see it through the
window but it seemed impossible that
the lizard-men would miss the big box

  they wrecked the rocket-motor we
could see that and they utterly demol-
ished the instrument and control board
and then they attacked the windows-as
though they had brains enough to know
that it would take a whole machine-shop

to fit new windows into the hull with the
gas-tight precision necessary for inter-
stellar travel

  the windows of the latest and best
unbreakable glass known to late twen-
tieth century science resisted their ef-
forts whereupon as though enraged by
this failure of their enormous strength
three of them stumped to the forest came
back with a rough log and using it as a
battering-ram knocked one window clear
out of its metal frame to fall with a clang
on the cabin floor within

  that fixed it never again would the
shell leave the ground

  coldly the lizard-men released us and
prodded us toward the forest brocks
great muscles tensed but in a moment
his shoulders drooped the shell was no
longer a thing worth fighting for and it
was obvious that preservation of life
could now be best attained by obeying
our hideous captors

  would they merely add us to the num-
ber of their slaves or would they rea-
son that we were not sufficiently docile
and execute us before we could stir up
rebellion only the future could tell us

the frightful encounter with the
god of the lizard-men will be
told in next months thrill-
ing chapters of this story

an unusual story about a gray man who came back from the grave to
comfort the dying and terrify the living

you still hear it said that there is chilling nobody will deny that surely
something bloody and ghoulish and there is the reason why my hair
about that newspaper the daily is supposed to be turning white when im
express it likes news that is heart- not yet thirty-one years old does being

                                                                                         


weird tales

a reporter for the daily express shock
the brown out of my scalp or are the
roots of my hair doing something on
their own account id like to know as
well as you meanwhile i keep well fed
on this job just as the peasants of lower
austria eat arsenic to gain a healthy color
and no other job would suit me

  reminds me a great deal of some of
the things the gray one himself said
one of them was if you dont get
scared-its as easy-as that such
words you wouldnt be liable to forget in
a hurry for twenty people who saw the
gray one will swear on their coffins that
he came from death returned from the
dead that sleep for ever to fulfill five
very strange errands before he died again

  that scoop made the greatest head-
lines in the history of the state news-
paper stories that are red and sticky and
coarse are made to order for the daily
express the ax-slayer two years ago who
lopped off the left hands of his victims
s s mistral floating into port with a
question mark painted on its foredeck
and no soul on board a band of little
children all less than eight years old
teaching a great dane dog to attack a
truant officer and jump for his throat
escaped convicts trapped in an aban-
doned mine beyond hill city their voices
wandering far underground and never
heard again

  bring in the story thats queer and
cold and spotted with goose-flesh and
well slam it on page one every time de-
clares mckenna

  hes the squarest-jawed and squarest-
shooting editor in the game and im
right now thinking of that occasion when
the telephone rang while he was begin-
ning the six oclock shift

  what is it about chief i ques-
tioned

  the stillness of night mckennas mo-

tion to keep quiet and that distant voice
sizzling and frying in the receiver

  the message ended and down on his
desk mckenna set the telephone and his
hand was hard to see shaking into the
pockets of his vest dived mckennas ten
fingers and they routed out a monster
cigar blacker than the shades around us
trying to be cool and easy trying and
vainly this time to show the whole round
world that his nerves were in fine fettle

  bill mckenna cleared his throat
with a quick and raw sound go out
and grab this story and so help you the
god that made you dont let anyone else
get it

  there were three other reporters in the
room dealing rummy next to the ice-
water tank but mckennas order was for
me and there was something in his face
that said to me id better not argue

  okay i retorted

  do me right on this bill he said
very unusually he was pleading
youre as smart a leg-man as there is in
the trade get everything there is on this
thing and get it quick stay in the west
end now listen today someone was
dying out there on larchmont avenue
where that epidemic has been cutting
them off like flies and somehow this
stranger slipped into the house he was
dressed in gray and he was tall he went
to the bedside and introduced himself as
the advance agent of death told the
sick man that he came from the other
world to help him die and for him not to
be frightened dying he said was easy
if you knew how the members of the
family at the bedside were paralyzed and
didnt know what to do they didnt
want to start a rough-house the stranger
talked like a man with brains the sick
man was glad the stranger came and he
passed away happy the stranger took
his leave by slipping out as he came in
charon



and nobody had strength to follow him
in my opinion it was all a nut act with
extra frills there was a tickling under
my collar however proving that the hair
on my neck was stiffening just a little

  theres good evidence that once be-
fore this week that guys gained his way
to the side of the dying at other places
and addresses hes made an effort to get
in-and doors were slammed in his face
folks are afraid of him hes at large
mckennas oily cigar spluttered and
showered sparks this is the first paper
thats been notified police are on the job
to catch him but the other papers think
theyre heading off burglaries

  youd get the idea mckenna wrote
headlines with his jaw to see it hunch
while he talked

  you can follow this guy into houses
if you want to said mckenna ijat
dont let yourself get into trouble dont
offend the people out that way its that
guy we want to find out about he says
he was dead once says he find out
what that means

  mckenna reached into his desk and
took out a gun which he laid in my hand
you wont need this maybe but that
stranger in gray has a brainy technique
if you have to use weapons of any kind
make it plain enough that its self-
defense collar and corner all the story
you can

  he sat back with a sigh- wait a min-
ute bill

  a minute or two went by while he
pondered every curious feature of it

  two or three times he admitted
weve looked foolish running wild
stories that were built on nothing but hot
air if this isnt the real goods dont
bother to bring it back

  that nearly bowled me over mc-
kenna so excited he was cautious

but you can tell if its good he ad-

vised me and i knew id better find it
was good if i can smell news myself
said mckenna this is the genuine mc-
coy a valet on larchmont avenue called
in the tip and sold it for five dollars
impatience now seethed between mc-
kennas tongue and his teeth as often as
he breathed

  go and get it and dont fail

   i wont chief i promised

out on larchmont avenue i made
my telephone base the drug store
on the comer of a street it was about
six-thirty oclock i bought some razor
blades and interviewed the clerk

   whos this death-watch thats annoy-
ing the neighborhood i asked

   he looked at me with a fishy cold eye
oh you heard did you reporter
yes who is it

   the drug clerk hesitated peered at the
door and shivered the place apparently
had been empty of customers for several
minutes before i happened along he
must have been glad of a homely chance
to talk to anyone even me

  how should i know and i dont
wanna

  why not

  am i crazy he mixed himself a
soda-and-lime and then absently threw it
in the sink the cops are on the job
thank gawd

   theyll handle it all right i hear the
neighborhoods nervous

   all but the dead

  what do you mean

  he put down the empty soda-and-lime
glass and licked his lips

  them that died werent nervous
the hair on my neck stirred again but
there was a draft pouring down my col-
lar from the transom over the door

  can you say how you account for
what you just told me


weird tales

  i aint tellin you nothin he said
with a dash of shrewdness im just
sayin whats been said by everybody in
this block

  that stranger must have a way with
them i suggested

  with them about to depart this life
he does admitted the clerk soberly
the gray one has a way with em
what i questioned

  hes known as the gray one re-
peated the man behind the counter his
smooth face a little red and foolish hes
successful with em because he knows
something

  good enough where is he seen
  in the rooms of the dyin

  but-before and after where is he
seen

  nowhere

  i started to reach for my pencil but
put it away again

  this looks like something thats too
elaborate for ordinary inspection come
on this strangers human he was
turned away from different places
yes the clerk conceded laughing
cynically ya know what they
wouldnt let im in up the street here last
night that was at old baxters baxter
was sick for three days with this epidemic
and suffered horrible stuff and he died
screaming for the gray one and
stretched out his arms and fell outa the
bed

  i was waiting for a crumb of real in-
formation where is baxters

  the clerk gave me the address with
reluctance

  thanks

darkness had come when i left the
drug store street lights were on and
the west end was settled for the night
one block away a policeman was sta-
tioned well out upon the crossing look-

ing along the street i could see three
more patrolmen silently posted to catch
him called the gray one windows for
the most part all along the way were bril-
liantly lit although a few homes had no
lights in their windows

  none of the bereaved families wanted
their sick members comforted by the
gray one i had never known anything
like it in all my life

  i walked along the block and tried to
wonder what headlines mckenna could
make out of this matter i wondered
again if it was true that i was the only
reporter hunting game

  within a minute i came to the nearest
cop and attempted to get a statement of
what opinion the police had on the case
seen him i hailed

  shut up

  now for all kinds of reasons the po-
lice are apt to be friendly with the news-
paper craft when they are not friendly
something is rotten-and it isnt neces-
sary to go to denmark to find what
that is

whats the matter i parried
he eyed me with irish honesty no
i aint seen him-that one-and i defy
any man to know what to do if he did
i grinned whats your orders

  just orders you know the kind he
took a breath bring him in alive

  i put one question to see what the ef-
fect would be expect to get him-
alive

  you wouldnt be kidding me would
you he eyed me with an owlish glance

  i shook my head this isnt the place
for a joke officer

  still more steadily he eyed me well
damn it i agree with yuh i didnt take
my exams for nothin like this

whats the latest about him tonight
nothin yet glory to the saints
where would he show up next
charon



  itd be a bad guess where them are
thats sickest

  but how can he tell when these peo-
ple are dying

  the cop shrugged he knows what
none of the rest know this is a handy
district for gossip everybodys checkin
up everybody else about the epidemic
every five minutes when the symptoms
are fatal the whole town hears the ver-
dict twelve hours in advance

  what would you call him

  id say somethin like a banshee
who is pretty sick-you know-right
now

  none near me was the very grateful
reply

  ill be moving along officer good-
night

  his dead-serious face was calm but his
mouth sagged with all his stout heart
he didnt like being left alone

away from the lighted crossing the
trees made a tunnel of the street and
dense black shadows over-edged one an-
other the epidemic was all around me
the little red cards dotted houses by the
clusterful and i walked among them
hoping that i didnt walk too safely for
i wanted to meet that death-watch with
every instant i calculated how far i was
from the telephone at the corner of a
street and larchmont avenue the wire
that would connect with mckenna at his
desk in case i ran into this one who
paralyzed the living and soothed the
dying

  i knew i would not lack a story if i saw
even as much as the color of his coat

  the gray one what kind of insane
genius was this extraordinary person who
feasted ghoul-like on the last moments
of others and yet played on their thoughts
so cleverly that they died grateful from
some casket or tomb he had risen to

walk dead-alive among the living what
cemetery did he come from or was he
a hoax there was no knowing what
sudi a freak was capable of i was armed
but imagined i would never use that gun
better it would be i figured to take my
diances for i had no desire-nor have i
ever had-to shoot a man down i turned
into the boulevard called riverbank
drive

   a shrill police whistle racketed and re-
bounded i spun on one heel and saw
the door of an address-it must have
been four blocks away-burst open and
people tumble from the house

  i got there with fast sprinting but
confusion made it hard to profit by that
moment another death had occurred in
the west end and he had been there
he had come and gone

  police arrived with great speed a
police lieutenant cursed violently barked
hasty orders and led a posse half
strengthened by frightened dtizens into
the lawns between the houses it was no
use the gray one had dissolved like
fog

  the hair on the nape of my neck
quieted again

  the gray one had come and gone
his clammy hands-were they clammy
coming from the grave-had touched
the fingers of the dying once more while
those about him had gazed at him nearly
mad with horror who was the gray
one

  i remembered the information con-
cerning the baxter house a few min-
utes of walking took me to the other end
of larchmont avenue and i went to the
number given me by the drug clerk i
rang the bell and saw lights flash on all
over the front of the house after an ex-
tremely long interval a man came to the
door in his shirt-sleeves gripping an iron
poker in his hand


weird tales

  i am a representative of the press
working with the police in capturing this
man who is alarming the section i said
turning out my press badge can you

help by-

  i dont know who you are he said
harshly balancing the poker

  a reporter for the star i explained
get away he ordered you look
like him

  that hit me right between the eyes
the gray one i asked and my own
surprize made me sound stupid

  the poker lifted in his hand

  youre mistaken i replied here

is my identification-

  the door shut heavily in the midst of
my remark in my face the earnest voice
of the one in shirt-sleeves continued ive
got a revolver and im loading it

   i let it go at that

tramping these streets alone and be-
ginning to question whether we were
all sweating after some shape made out
of fog or vapor i stepped over a curb
and stopped short the rustling of shrub-
bery convinced me as the movement of
someone skulking not far away

  i gathered myself together and stepped
off the sidewalk onto the lawn i could
see nothing at all ten feet back from the
street all was black as the sky overhead
but i knew that in my position i myself
couldnt be seen in a few moments
bushes parted and out into the blue-yellow
light of the street lamps stepped a man
in gray

  keeping quiet i went toward him ad-
vancing on grass which acted like a cush-
ion his hearing was acute or he smelled
danger at first he was facing in the other
direction then he turned and lunged
straight at my head i dodged and lost
my footing but in the slack of his collar
i wound my fingers and pulled him down

also for a moment we fought like sav-
ages the swinging light of a street lamp
almost blinded me he backed off sud-
denly and spoke you damned fool
the voice gave it away double or
nothing i answered and i suppose
youre here because you can only sleep in
the daytime

  same as you grinned ted corbett
reporter for the herald-t elegram what
have you made out of it so far

  just wasted time and your score
its early yet hes in the neighbor-
hood they tell me

   corbett lit a cigarette

  youd better douse that light i sug-
gested hell spot you and you say
you havent seen him

  a baffled puzzled discontent was in
corbetts face one burglar busy at
work and a platoon of police moved out
here to get him does mckenna think
thats good for a spread-head

  headlines banners spread-heads
streamers screaming across the width of
the paper big news strange ugly
but news-for the breakfast-table stom-
ach the brain the nerves jar em
scare em

  i pictured mckenna waiting at his
desk grim as time itself and cold as ice
now that the first excitement of the case
was over he and his voracious appetite
for headlines the thunder of doomsday
wouldnt tear him from that desk or
mean any more to him than new head-
lines give him another smash story to
build up the circulation and dont
fail me bill

  licking his fangs and tasting his chops
mckenna scratching for news in differ-
ent boneyards like a hound with a belly
of cast-iron an x-ray of his vital organs
would probably show he had a heart the
shape of a stick of type and just as thin
but it was all right with me since cor-
charon



bett thought this night prowler called
the gray one was a burglar for it bore
out mckennas claim that none of the
other newspapers were on to the gray
ones real character

  corbett and i parted with a wary ex-
change of glances

whilje convinced that corbett had
never heard of the gray one i
intended to take no chances but to tele-
phone mckenna what scraps of hearsay i
could it would be no stoiy but it would
be a teaser worth headlines i was walk-
ing rapidly to get to the drug store tele-
phone and was in the course of crossing
a wide lawn that ran diagonally back of
a corner house and came out on the next
street the corner house was a california-
type bungalow but for a false attic all
the rooms were on the first floor and
brilliantly lighted as i passed these
lighted rooms i saw a sight that held me

  a bedroom window was flung open to
the breeze the curtains flopped idly and
i saw a sickroom scene-a death-bed
scene the unfortunate one i could not
see but for his restless hand on the
covers three people were in attitudes of
expectancy and anguish about that room
three that i could count a fourth person
male rugged and fierce of appearance
stood almost wholly blocking a hall door
and staring out into the darkness beyond
he waited i figured he must be block-
ing the door against the coming of the
gray one when i saw something that
made my case-hardened reporters heart
leap in my throat

  the broad porch of this house circled
half-way around one side to where there
was a front door even as i looked a
form in gray pressed closely against the
door tried it with his fingers and softly
pushed it in

  the starch suddenly left me with my

experience in the reporters game telling
me that there were few things worth
being afraid of i nevertheless paused
when one hesitates there is a sickness
that grips him i was sick

  i saw that deathroom scene again
with a glance at that open window and
i had the will to jump with decision
toward the porch the thing then heard
me turned and stopped as i pounded on
and silently leaping away over the front
of the porch after another second or two
whisked shadow-like across the street in
the tricky light i ran headlong after it
as if my own life and my own escape
from death depended on stamping out
that form or fog or vapor when i caught
it

   i chased its trail until i realized that i
was only chasing the shadows of harmless
things where did it go where did
what go

  confused and exhausted i staggered
out of a driveway into a street on the
crossing a patrolman braced himself and
tugged at his holster but first his left
hand raised and he swiftly crossed him-
self the buttons and insignia on his
uniform sparkled for rain was beginning
to fall

  the copper recognized me and i passed
him breath spent without saying a word

   reaching the drug store i entered the
phone booth without speaking to the
clerk he was startled when i came in
and he dropped a soda-shaker

   its bill i called mckenna and i
cant tell you much except that i saw that
freak for one second and then he disap-
peared i guess if i hang around out
here he might show-

  get it bill cut in mckenna with
the voice of command dont come back
empty-handed and dont fail

   i said yessir and hung up

  out into the rain i stepped again-it


weird tales

was pouring briskly by this time-and i
remember i felt more stubborn than dis-
couraged the riddle of the gray one
had twisted its fog tightly around my
heart and i swore with myself to solve it

  the short collar of my suit didnt keep
the rain out of my neck i looked left
and right and stood on the curb a mo-
ment

  a police squad car came out of larch-
mont avenue and headed due north
away from the west end with its radio
crackling as i could tell by the attitude of
its two-man crew i hailed it

  whats up leaving this beat i
hollered

  the driver slowed down at the rain-
slippery corner goin across town he
answered boss dolans sick

  i knew immediately whom he meant
one of those exceedingly thin hunches
came to me coupled with an unpraise-
worthy wish to get out of the rain
thunder was beginning to rattle

  give me a lift i appealed

  jump in reporter

   pretty soft for boss dolan i reflected
having such strong political ties that he
could have an owl-car at his service to run
errands whether he was well or ill and
dolan had already been an invalid for
several months

on humboldt street was dolans
modest home his front door was
open and a number of ward workers
were gathered there as we came up the
street

  whats the word about the boss i
asked those i knew personally

  a wreath of pale set faces seemed to
arise around me

  hes dyin

  a young district doctor ran out of the
house and clattered down to the ambu-
lance that rested at the curb

  was this too far away for the gray
one to operate would he dare to visit
boss dolan

  id like to go in for a minute sort
of i said

  a few shrugged their shoulders why
not wait said one with the ghastliest
candor i can remember

  thats foolish another said even
a smile now might help i think ill go
in if you will he inquired of me

   sure i replied

  with all his faults he was generally
good to the rank and file of his ward
my companion whispered

  he was i subscribed truthfully

  i saw boss dolan and saw something
of sad interest to his admirers that
meant something that held delight for
his enemies he was slipping away and
he was afraid a reporter of an opposi-
tion paper could make much of this but
not i

  a cluck of sympathy sounded from the
tongue of the man i had accompanied in

  tough i murmured

  boss dolan was afraid

  the doctor toyed glumly with his watch
fob as he stared at an assortment of uten-
sils on a small table seizing a powder
box a vial and a small pestle and mortar
that were on the table he left the room
for some final experiment some instants
later i heard a clinking and tapping in
the kitchen sink it was mixed with the
cadence of thunder somewhere over the
house

  poor devil whispered the one at my
side and he went forward to the place
vacated by the doctor

  dolan he uttered smoothly and
touched the sick mans hands

  a strange feeling dragged within me
and i breathed heavily

  dont let it get your goat dolan
spoke this ready sympathizer you can

                  w t-
charon



take it easy-if you want youre all
slated but youre not in any pain and
youre only a little nervous its the soft-
est thing you ever saw i know and im
here to tell you see if you dont get
scared-its as easy-as that its in my
eye dolan yknow im not lyin any-
body who has been in the last hour knows
that i know-look at my eyes if you
dont believe it ah well enough
yknow im right dolan its the same
for you as for all the rest it was the
same for me when i died that was six
months ago for the first time i think
they let somebody come back anyway i
did to help you its a certain cinch
lean on me dolan - its a short
road-

  im not going to describe the shock
and the stupor this caused

  thats the effect this one had when he
worked thats why people were para-
lyzed by confusion and later harried out
of their wits the way of it all was a
certain thing and the thing crept in so
slowly and softly that it was there and
established before one could hark to it
as much as i was fully forewarned i
was caught in the spell of amazement all
too soon before i was ready

 slowly gathered myself out of that
daze yet before i stirred a foot there
was the slightest and the most harmless
sound from some distance as far as the
front door of the house but at that dis-
turbance the gray one whipped about
away from the bed and poised on his
toes i then saw that his face was white
sickly and unchangeable of expression
there was another sound beyond the
room perhaps a scraping in the hall the
gray one leaped with a great spring away
from the bed and was through the door
i gazed numbly where he had been and
saw that dolan had peacefully died

    w t-

  got him at last

  a captain of police and two regulars
surrounded the gray one neatly catch-
ing him as he began his last escape as
he wrenched and twisted in their grasp
he hissed in that indescribable voice of
his let me alone damn you im here
on my business-the special agent of
death you cant hold me that was at
one time kaye ronn -------

  flash as walter winchell says i had
the whole astounding story in the twink-
ling of an eye but in the next breath
the gray one summoned all his strength

  ten men couldnt have held him and
i was out there in the hall by then trying
to help the cops all i got for my
trouble was a beautiful black eye i want-
ed to save our mysterious prisoner for
the daily express and nothing else for
an exclusive interview and photographs
and quotations and signed statements

  that was a hope entirely in vain be-
cause the gray one had other ideas he
fought like a beast his mouth champing
froth and his teeth making ribbons of his
own lips

  the telephone wheres the tele-
phone i yelled thinking only of editor
mckenna

  it was natural that no one paid any
attention to me for at that point the
gray one broke loose and flew from the
house he flew or so you would have
said if youd seen him landed on the
sidewalk anyway without touching the
steps and away across the street and
through an empty field

  the rain was coming down in vats
kicking up mud that splashed the tops of
fence palings and even automobile hoods
you couldnt see very well but the police
were after the gray one in three jumps

  when i had crossed the street and
gone five yards farther joining in the
chase i was plastered with mud accord-


weird tales

ing to the weather records that was a
cloudburst and i could have told you as
much while it fell did you ever choke
in rain until you could hardly breathe

  beyond the field was a graveyard and
on the far border of it was a hopping
traveling shape that might have been
the gray one or gray streaks of rain

  kaye ronn

  the police started firing at that very
uncertain target

  dont hit him i shouted he
hasnt done any harm hes committed
no crime

  it was unthinkable that the daily ex-
press should miss the chance to interview
that strange figure while i was still so
near him

  the name had been spoken only once
but once was enough kaye ronn

  theres no need to kill him i pro-
tested to the police captain plunging
through the field beside me you know
how he got into the news six months ago
he was that fellow named ronn who
made a living taking supplies up the
river in a boat of his to that lumber
camp beyond hill city he took passen-
gers across the river too and he used to
preach to them about death and damna-
tion but the way he got into the news
six months ago was by belonging to one
of those queer cult burial societies they
didnt believe in embalming and when
ronn died they just clapped him in a
box and drove him to this graveyard here
but he wasnt dead hed just had a fit
or something and he wakes up and
raps on the box and howls until they let
him out

  the captain of police lowered his gun
at that moment and i shouted in his ear

  you see now why this kaye ronn
was acting like he was in the west end
and at dolans when he got out of that
casket he was practically cuckoo you

know a thing like that would drive any-
body crazy and ronn had a head start
he seems to figure he was dead as a door-
nail before he woke up in that casket he
thinks hes returned to life so you see
why hes tipping off other people who
are dying-he figures its his business to
guide them along and lend em a hand
you get it all now hes elected himself
as assistant to the angel of death with
errands to do at as many death-beds as he
can get to hes got away with five of
those errands anyway

  this case was so colossal that it was a
weight upon the imagination and i knew
it would be well to unload the whole
affair on mckenna as soon as possible
was there a telephone in this no-mans-
land away from humboldt street

  continued gun-fire the captain of
police who i thought had lowered his re-
volver after my explanation had instead
dropped the muzzle so he could the better
feed more bullets into the chambers he
hadnt heard a word i had said or any-
thing else but the lashing of the rain to
him ronn was a dangerous maniac

where the field ended and the
graveyard began i dont know and
i learned the difference chiefly by barking
my shins on tombstones in those few
minutes of the cloudburst wind and rain
had washed most of the grave hummocks
flat so that where tombstones were blown
down there was no longer anything to
identify one grave from another

  snatches of voices the storm drove
words and parts of words against my ear
river    sticks    sticks

  lightning as tangled as a spiders web
flashed down and showed the fugitive
kaye ronn in a scene that could be com-
pared to a nightmare he was on the
farther edge of the graveyard and had
gained several yards on us the river
charon



ran by known simply as the creek but
in that locality more often called sticks
river from the fact that waste wood
from the lumber mill frequently drifted
on its current that was what i had got
in those storm-driven voices the police
directing one another by hollering sticks
river

  and on the swollen brim of the river
was kaye ronn drenched from head to
feet like a symbolic figure in weedy gar-
ments upon the brink he could be seen
and not even the lightning could kill his
grayness he stooped over a boat his
own boat tethered to the earth and
from among the grisly monuments and
tombstones he lifted in his arms a limp
lifeless thing which he threw in the boat
before him

  then i knew that to know too much is
sometimes perilous for i shivered and
my stomach revolted i remembered
ancient legends that fitted kaye ronn
perfectly everlasting tales brewed five
thousand years ago and i was scared stiff

  the police with bulldog efficiency had
their minds on practical matters by the
same stake where ronn had tethered his
boat they found other craft rowboats
and sculls riding on the flooded surface
this must have been a favored landing
for boatmen who kept up a traffic between
the humboldt street end of town and
hill city on the other bank

  sticks river

  a disagreeable mixture of those ancient
tales ran through my head but i was in
the first boat the police shoved off to
overtake the gray one

  and one more-only one more-sight
of that peculiar character was given us
when lightning slanted again crooked
into a design like fiery fingers the light-
ning leaped and showed ronn standing
tall and arrogant at the wheel of his ves-
sel-at his knees that huddled thing he

had raised on the edge of the graveyard

  was the gray one abandoning the
dying to clutch at the dead themselves
and take them with him

  to telephone mckenna at the first
chance was a determination of mine near-
ly buried under by a horror never felt by
any man but myself

  i was afraid of kaye ronn and not
because he had waked up in a casket
before he died i was afraid of the
river we were crossing and not because
it was a deep creek in a canyon of clay
afraid and i say it today and i am not
ashamed

  of course the soaked and bedraggled
thing in the waste of the gray ones
boat may have been only a strip of tar-
paulin pelted away by the wind and re-
covered again on the graveyards edge

  this was the twentieth century after
all kaye ronn was probably only kaye
ronn an eccentric riverman and that
night of fury and supernatural storm
might not have changed the river a bit
from the common stream it had always
been

  wonder always runs like a river deep-
er than common sense for in my dis-
mayed brain i was thinking how when
the world was young and creation was
just finished and a lot of things were
known that have been forgotten since
wise men said that everybody who died
was carried away to hell by charon

  charon was the immortal boatman who
crossed the waters between earth and
hell constantly taking away the dying
with their last breath and removing them
to the hereafter and the term for the
hereafter in those times whether a pleas-
ant hereafter or an evil hereafter was
hell

  oh mckenna-waiting at the end of
a busy line for news


weird tales

  and the ancient boatmans name was
charon-which name happened to be
said the same as if it had been kaye
ronn and the waters between earth and
hell over which charon ferried the dead
vere the waters of a river called the
styx styx the river sticks river
kaye ronn

  the burst of thunder that tailed the
storm didnt originate in my mind but
there seemed to be a closely related con-
nection

  the rain stopped lightning rippled
almost playfully across the earth

  we had grounded on the farther bank
the fugitive was not to be seen and yet
it was plain that he had foundered cap-

sized or disappeared with all his pos-
sessions in the expanded river stood a
sign-post on which had once been printed
hill city the word city was
split off and gone the other half of the
sign bearing the capitals hill ending
in a splintered arm pointing down into
the water white splashes of clay drib-
bled from the letter i making it an e
one word pointing toward the bottom of
the river

  my chin came up as i shuddered and
i gazed overhead

  what are you looking for yelled a
cop the soul of the gray one

  no i lied im wondering where
those telephone wires go

ands of the dead

by seabury quinn

a gripping story of weird surgery and dual personality-
a tale of fules de grand in

t f there were such a thing as a
platinum blond tom-cat im sure it
would look like doctor de gran-
din my dinner partner a long-eyed
sleek-haired brunette in a black-crpe
gown cut to the base of her throat in
front and slashed in a v below the waist
behind gestured with her oddly oblique
eyes across the table toward jules de
grandin hes a funny little fellow-
rather a darling though miss travers
added just see how he looks at virginia
bushrod wouldnt you think she was a
particularly luscious specimen of sparrow

and he-

  why should he watch miss bushrod
particularly i countered shes very
lovely but-

  oh i dont think hes interested in
her face pretty as it is miss travers
laughed hes watching her hands
everybody does

  i looked along the candle-lighted table
with its ornate georgian silver and lace-
and-linen cloth until my eye came to rest
upon virginia bushrod latest of the
arrivals at the merridews house party
she was also probably the most interest-
ing you could not judge her casually a
pale white skin lightly tanned on beach
and tennis court amber eyes shading to
brown hair waved and parted in dull-
gold ringlets curled closely on the back-
curve of her small and shapely head the
dead-white gown she wore set off her
bright blond beauty and a pair of heavy
hands of the dead



gold bracelets tight-clasped about her
wrists drew notice to her long and slen-
der hands

  they were extraordinary hands not
large not small their shapeliness was
statuesque their form as perfect as a
sculptors dream with straight and supple
fingers and a marvelous grace of move-
ment expressive as a spoken word
almost it seemed to me as she raised the
spun-glass venetian goblet of madeira
her hands possessed an independent being
of their own a consciousness of volition
which made them not a mere part of her

body but something allied with though
not subservient to it

  her hands are rarely beautiful i
commented what is she an actress a

dancer perhaps-

  no said miss travers and her voice
sank to a confidential whisper but a
year ago we thought shed be a hopeless
cripple all her life both hands were
mangled in a motor accident

  but thats impossible i scoffed
watching miss bushrods graceful ges-
tures with renewed interest ive been
in medicine almost forty years no hands


weird tales

which suffered even minor injuries could
be as flexible as hers

  they did just the same miss tra-
vers answered stubbornly the doctors
gave up hope and said theyd have to
amputate them at the wrist her father
told me so virginia gave phil connor
back his ring and was ready to resign her-
self to a life of helplessness when-

  yes i smiled as she came to a halt
lay versions of medical miracles are
always interesting to the doctor and i
was anxious to learn how the hopeless
cripple had been restored to perfect
manual health

  doctor augensburg came over here

and they went to him as a last resort-

  i should think they would i inter-
jected augensburg half charlatan a
quarter quack perhaps a quarter genius
was a fair example of the army of medi-
cal marvels which periodically invades
america he was clever as a workman
we all admitted that and in some opera-
tions of glandular transplanting had
achieved remarkable results but when he
came out with the statement that he had
discovered how to make synthetic flesh
for surgical repair work the medical so-
cieties demanded that he prove his claims
or stop the grand triumphal tour that he
was making of his clinics he failed to
satisfy his critics and returned to austria
several thousand dollars richer but com-
pletely discredited in medical circles

  well they went to him miss tra-
vers answered shortly and you see what

he accomplished he-

  her argument was stilled as jane mer-
ridew who acted as her brothers hostess
gave the signal for the ladies to retire

chinese lanterns orange red pale
jade blossomed in the darkness of
the garden farther off the vine-draped
wall cast its shadow over close-clipped

grass and winding flagstone paths there
were rustic benches underneath the
ginkgo trees a drinking-fountain fash-
ioned like a lions head with water flush-
ing in an arc between its gaping jaws
sent a musically mellow tinkle through
the still night air i sighed regretfully as
i followed the men into the billiard room
the mid-victorian custom of enforced
separation of men and women for a
period after dinner had always seemed to
me a relic of the past we might well stuff
and donate to a museum

  anybody want to play ralph chap-
man took a cue down from the rack and
rubbed its felt-tipped end with chalk
spot you a dollar a shot phil are you
on

  not i the youth addressed respond-
ed with a grin you took me into camp
last time go get another victim

  young chapman set the balls out on
the table surveyed them critically a mo-
ment then taking careful aim made a
three-cushion shot and followed it with
another which bunched the gleaming
spheres together in one corner

  de grandin raised a slender well-
manicured hand and patted back a yawn
mon dieu he moaned to me it is
sad outside there is the beauty of the
night and of the ladies and we pardieu
we sit and swelter here like a pack of
sacre fools while he knocks about the
relics of departed elephants me i have
enough i go to join the ladies if-

  may i try ralph glowing in de-
fiant gayety lips wine-moist eyes bright
and wandering virginia bushrod poised
upon the threshold of the wide french
window which let out on the terrace
ive never played she added but to-
night i feel an urge for billiards ive
got a yen to knock the little balls around
if you know what i mean

  never too late to learn young chap-
hands of the dead



man grinned at her im game ill pay
you five for every kiss you make

  kiss she echoed puzzled

  kiss is right infant a purely tech-
nical term see heres a kiss deftly he
brought the balls together in light con-
tact paused a moment then with a quick
flick of his cue repeated the maneuver
twice thrice four times

  o-oh i see her eyes were bright
with something more than mere anticipa-
tion it seemed to me they shone like
those of a drunkard long deprived of
drink when liquor is at last accessible

   see here you take the stick like this
began young chapman but the girl
brushed past him took a cue down from
the rack and deftly rubbed the cube of
chalk against its tip

  she leant across the table her smooth
brow furrowed in a frown of concentra-
tion thrust the cue back and forth across
her fingers tentatively then swiftly as a
striking snake the smooth wood darted
forward around the table went the cue
ball taking the cushions at a perfect
angle click-click the ivory spheres
kissed each other softly then settled down
a little way apart their polished surfaces
reflecting the bright lamplight

  bravo virginia cried ralph chap-
man i couldnt have made a better shot
myself talk about beginners luck

  the girl apparently was deaf eyes
shining lips compressed she leant across
the table darted forth her cue and made
an expert draw shot gathering the balls
together as though they had been mag-
netized then followed a quick volley
shot the cue ball circled round the table
spun sharply in reverse english and
kissed the other balls with so light an im-
pact that the click was hardly audible

  again and again she shot driving her
cue ball relentlessly home against the
others never missing making the most

difficult shots with the sure precision be-
tokening long mastery of the game
fever-eyed white-faced oblivious to all
about her she made shot follow shot
until a hundred marks had been run off
and it seemed to me that she was sating
some fierce craving as she bent above the
table cue in hand

  phil connor her young fiance was as
puzzled as the rest watching her inimita-
ble skill first with wonder then with
something like stark fear at last vir-
ginia he cried seizing her by the elbow
and fairly dragging her away virginia
honey youve played enough

  oh an oddly puzzled look gath-
ered between her slim brows and she
shook her head from side to side like a
waking sleeper who would clear his brain
of dreams did i do well

  very well very well indeed for one
who never played the game before
ralph chapman told her coldly

  but ralph i never did she
answered honestly i never had a bil-
liard cue in my hands before tonight
no his tone was icy if this is

your idea of being sporting----------

  see here chapman young connors
irish blood was quick to take the implica-
tion up ginnies telling you the truth
there isnt a billiard table in her fathers
house or mine there wasnt any in her
sorority house shes never had a chance
to play dont you think id know it if
she liked the game i tell you it was luck

sheer luck-

   at five dollars per lucky point

that but for her to play the wide-eyed
innocent and let him offer her five dollars

sporting

the thing holds water

  of course it does idiot i assured

him with a laugh you wanted a drink

  the big old house was silent as a tomb
as we crept down the stairs slipped silent-
ly along the central hall and headed for
the dining-room de grandin paused
abruptly hand upraised and obedient to
his signal i too halted

  in the music room which opened from
the hallway on the right someone was
playing the piano very softly with a
beautiful harpsichord touch the lovely
haunting sadness of the londonderry air
came to us as we listened the gently-
struck notes falling one upon another
like water dripping from a lichened rock
into a quiet woodland pool

  exquisite i began but the french-
mans hand raised to his lips cut short my
commendation as he motioned me to
follow

  virginia bushrod sat before the in-
strument her long slim fingers flitting
fitfully across the ivory keys the wide
gold bracelets on her wrists agleam
black-lace pajamas less concealing than a
whorl of smoke revealed the gracious
curves of her young body with a subtle
glow as wisps of banking storm-clouds
dim but do not hide the moon

  as we paused beside the door the
sweet melody she played gave way to
something else a lecherous macabre
theme in c sharp minor seductive and
compelling but revolting as a painted
corpse already touched with putrefaction
swaying gently to the rhythm of the
music she turned her face toward us and
hands of the dead



in the wavering candlelight i saw her
eyes were closed long lashes sweeping
against pale-gold cheeks smooth fine-
veined eyelids gently lowered

  i turned to jules de grandin with a
soundless question and he nodded
affirmation but yes she sleeps my
friend he whispered do not waken
her

  the music slowly sank to a thin echo
and miss bushrod rose with lowered lids
and gently parted lips swayed uncertain-
ly a moment then passed us with a slow
and gliding step her slim bare feet
soundless as a draft of air upon the rug-
strewn floor slowly she climbed the
stairs one shapely hand upon the carven
balustrade the dim night-light which
burned up in the gallery picking little
points of brightness from her golden
wristlets

  probably neurotic i murmured as i
watched her turn left and disappear
around the pillar at the stairhead they
say she underwent an operation on her
hands last year and-

  de grandin motioned me to silence as
he teased the needle-points of his mus-
tache between his thumb and finger
quite so he said at length precise-
ly exactly one wonders

  wonders what i asked

  how long we have to wait until we
get that drink he answered with a grin
come let us get it quickly or we need
not go to bed at all

breakfast was no formal rite at mer-
ridews a long buffet ready-set
with food and gay with raffia-bound ital-
ian glassware mexican pottery and
bowls daisies chickory and queen annes
lace stood upon the terrace while little
tables spread with bright-checked peasant
linen dotted the brick paving

  de grandin piled a platter high with

food poured himself a cup of coffee and
set to work upon the viands tell me
good friend trowbridge he command-
ed as he returned from the sideboard with
a second generous helping of steamed
sole what did you note if anything
when we caught mademoiselle bushrod
at her midnight music

  i eyed him speculatively when jules
de grandin asked me questions such as
that they were not based on idle curiosity

  youre on the trail of something i
evaded

  he spread his hands before him imi-
tating someone groping in the dark i
think i am he answered slowly but i
can not say of what come tell me what
you noticed if you please

  well i bent my brows in concentra-
tion first of all id say that she was
sleep-walking that she had no more idea
what she was doing than i have what shes
doing now

  he nodded acquiescence precisely

he agreed and-

  then i was struck by the fact that
though she had apparently risen from bed
she had those thick barbaric bracelets on
her wrists

  hola touche he cried delightedly
you have put the finger on it it was un-
usual was it not

  id say so i agreed then-why
bless my soul i paused in something
like dismay as sudden recollection came
to me

  he watched me narrowly eyebrows
raised

  she turned the wrong way at the stair-
head i exclaimed the womens rooms
are to the right of the stairs the mens to
the left dont you remember colonel

merridew said-

  i remember perfectly he cut in i
also saw her turn that way but preferred
to have corroboration--


weird tales

the clatter of hoofs on the driveway
cut short his remarks and a moment
later virginia bushrod joined us on the
terrace she looked younger and much
smaller in her riding-clothes white
breeches obviously of london cut were
topped by a white-linen peasant blouse
gay with wool embroidery open at the
throat but with sleeves which came down
to the gauntlets of her doeskin gloves
for belt she wore a brilliant knit-silk
roman scarf and another like it knotted
turbanwise around her head its glowing
reds and greens and yellows bringing out
the charming colors of her vivid laugh-
ing face black boots reaching to the
knee encased her high-arched narrow
feet and slender legs

  hello sleepy-heads she greeted as
she sat down at our table whereve you
been all morning making up for night
calls and such things ive been up for
hours-and im famished

  what will it be mademoiselle de
grandin asked as he leaped up nimbly to
serve her a little toast perhaps-a bowl
of cereal

  not for me she denied laughing
i want a mans-sized breakfast ive rid-
den fifteen miles this morning

  as she peeled off her white-chamois
gloves i caught the glint of golden brace-
lets on her wrists

  we enjoyed your playing mademoi-
selle the little frenchman told her smil-
ingly as obedient to her orders he de-
posited a mans-sized plate of food
before her the londonderry air is
beautiful but that other composition
which you played with such verve such

feeling it was-

  is this a joke miss bushrod looked
at him through narrowed eyes if it is
i cant quite see the humor

  mais non it is no jest i do assure

you music is one of my passions and
although i play but poorly i enjoy to

hear it your talent-

  then youve mistaken me for someone
else the girl cut in a quick flush mount-
ing to her face im one of those unfor-
tunates whos utterly tone-deaf i-

  thats right christine travers vir-
tually naked in a sun-back tennis blouse
and shorts emerged through the french
windows and dropped down beside miss
bushrod ginnies tone-deaf as an
oyster couldnt carry a tune in a market
basket

  but my dear young lady i began
when a vicious kick upon my shin cut my
protest short

  yes miss travers smiled her slow
somewhat malicious smile were you
going to tell ginnie youve a remedy for
tone-deafness doctor something nice
and mild like arsenic or corrosive sub-
limate if youll just tell her how to take

it ill see-

  doctar trowbridge doctar de gran-
nun suh come quick fo de lawds
sake noah blackstone merridews stout
colored butler burst upon the terrace his
usual serene aplomb torn to shreds by
sudden terror come runnin genle-
mens sumpin awfuls happened

  eh what is it you say de grandin

asked something awful-

  yas suh sumpin dreadful mistu-
mistu chapmans done been kilt sum-
buddys murdered im hes daid
dead ralph chapman horror
mounted in virginia bushrods amber
eyes as she seemed to look past us at some
scene of stark tragedy ralph chapman
-dead unthinkingly mechanically as
another woman might have wrung her
handkerchief in similar circumstances she
took the heavy silver fork with which she
had been eating and bent it in a spiral
hands of the dead



sprawled supinely across the bed pro-
truding eyes staring sightlessly at the
ceiling ralph chapman lay mouth
slightly agape tongue thrust forward it
needed no second glance to confirm the
butlers diagnosis and it required only a
second glance to confirm his suspicion of
murder for in those bulging eyes and
that protruding tongue no less than in
the area of bruise upon the throat we
read the autograph of homicide

  so de grandin gazed upon the body
speculatively then crossed the room took
the dead boys face between his hands
and raised the head it was as if the head
and body joined by a cord rather than a
column of bone and muscle for there was
no resistance to the little frenchmans
slender hands as the young mans chin
nodded upward ah-so-o-o de gran-
din murmured he used unnecessary
violence this one see my friend-he
turned the body half-way over and point-
ed to a purpling bruise upon the rear of
the neck-two hands were used in
front we have the murderers thumb and
finger marks behind is ecchymosis due to
counter-pressure and so great a force
was used that not only was this poor one
strangled but his neck was broken as
well

   he passed his fingers tentatively along
the outline of young chapmans jaw
then how long has he been dead my
friend he asked

   following his example i felt the dead
boys jaw then his chest and lower throat
hm i glanced at my watch my guess
is six or seven hours theres still some
stiffening of the jaw but not much in the
chest and the forearms are definitely hard
-yes id say six hours at the least eight
at the most judging by the advance of
rigor mortis that would place the time
of death--

  somewhere near midnight he sup-

plied then irrelevantly they were
strong hands that did this thing my
friend the muscles of our necks are tough
our vertebrae are hard yet this ones neck
is snapped as though it were a reed
you-youve a suspicion i faltered
i think so he returned sweeping
the room with a quick stock-taking
glance

  ah what is this he strode across
the rug coming to pause before the bu-
reau on the hanging mirror of the cabi-
net outlined plainly as an heraldic device
blazoned on a coat of arms was a hand-
print long slender fingers the mounts of
the palm and the delicately sweeping
curve of the heel etched on the gleaming
surface as though a hand dank with per-
spiration had been pressed upon it

  now his slim black brows rose in
saracenic arches as he regarded me quizzi-
cally for why should a midnight visit-
ant especially if bent on murder take
pains to leave an autograph upon the mir-
ror good friend trowbridge he de-
manded

  b-but thats a womans hand i stam-
mered whoever broke ralph chap-
mans neck was strong as a gorilla you

just said so a woman-

  tell me my friend he interrupted
fixing me with that level disconcerting
stare of his do you not wish to see that
justice triumphs

  why yes of course but-

  and is it your opinion-i ask you as
a man of medicine-that a mans neck
offers more resistance than by example a
silver table-fork

  i stared at him dumfounded ralph
chapman had publicly denounced vir-
ginia bushrod as a cheat we had seen her
going toward his room about the time of
the murder within five minutes we had
seen her give a demonstration of manual
strength scarcely to be equaled by a pro-


weird tales

fessional athlete the evidence was

damning but-

  youre going to turn her over to the
police i asked

  for answer he drew the green-silk
handkerchief peeping from the pocket of
his brown sports coat wadded it into a
mop and erased the handprint from the
mirror come my friend he ordered
we must write out our report before the
coroner arrives

the mortician to whom coroner lor-
don had entrusted chapmans body
obligingly lent his funeral chapel for the
inquest the jury picked at random from
the villagers occupied the space custom-
arily assigned to the remains the coro-
ner himself sat in the clergymans en-
closure witnesses were made comfort-
able in the family room being called out
one by one to testify through the cur-
tained doorway leading to the chapel-in-
geniously arranged to permit the mourn-
ing family to see and hear the funeral
ceremonies without being seen by those
assembled in the auditorium-we saw the
butler testify to finding the body and
heard him say he summoned de grandin
and me immediately

  you give it as your medical opinion
that death had taken place some six or
seven hours earlier the coroner asked
me

   yes sir i replied

  and what in your opinion was the
cause of death

  without the confirmation of an au-
topsy i can only hazard an opinion i re-
turned but from superficial examination
i should say it was due to respiratory fail-
ure caused by a dislocation of the spinal
column and rupture of the cord the dis-
location as nearly as i could judge from
feeling of the neck took place between
the second and third cervical vertebrae

  and how was the spinal fracture

caused

  by manual pressure sir-pressure
with the hands the bruises on the dead
mans neck show the murderer grasped
him by the throat at first probably to
stifle any outcry then placed one hand
behind his head and with die other forced
the chin violently upward thereby simu-
lating the quick pressure given the neck
in cases of judicial hanging

  it would have required a man of more
than usual strength to commit this mur-
der in the manner you have described it

  i drew a deep breath of relief yes
sir it would have had to be such a man
i answered emphasizing the final word
unconsciously perhaps

  thank you doctor said the coroner
and called de grandin to corroborate my
testimony

  as the inquisition lengthened it be-
came apparent coroner lordon had a
theory of his own which he was in-
geniously weaving into evidence rather
subtly he brought out the fact that the
household had retired by eleven-thirty
and not till then did he call for testimony
of the quarrel which had flared up in the
billiard room the painful scene was re-
enacted in minute detail six men were
forced to swear they heard young connor
threaten to break chapmans neck

  mr connor asked the coroner you
rowed stroke oar at norwood i believe

  phil connor nodded and in his eyes
was growing terror

  day before yesterday you won a
twenty-dollar bet with colonel merridew
by tearing a telephone directory in quar-
ters did you not

  a murmur ran along the jury as the
question stabbed young connor like a
rapier-thrust

  i saw virginia bushrod blanch beneath
her tan saw her long slim hand go out
hands of the dead



to clutch her lovers but my interest in
the by-play ceased as the final question
hurtled like a crossbow bolt

  mr connor where were you between
the hours of twelve and two last night
the tortured youths face flushed then
went white as tallow as the frightened
blood drained back the trap had
sprung he rose grasping at the chair in
front of him till lines of white showed on
his hands as the flexor muscles stood out
pallidly against his sun-tanned skin

  i-i must refuse to answer- he

began and i could see his throat working
convulsively as he fought for breath

what i was doing then is no affair-

  pardonnez-moi monsieur le coro-
ner de grandin rose and bowed re-
spectfully i do not wonder that the
young man is embarrassed he was with
me and-believe me i am grieved to
mention it and would not if it were not
necessary--he was drunk

  drunk a slow flush stained the coro-
ners face as he saw his cherished case
evaporating

  drunk the little frenchman echoed
casting a grin toward the responsive jury
but yes monsieur drunk like a pig so
drunk he could not mount the stairs un-
aided

  before he could be interrupted he pro-
ceeded

  me i am fond of liquor i like it in
the morning i delight in it at noon at
night i utterly adore it last night when
i had gone to bed i felt the need of
stimulant i rose and went downstairs
and as i reached the bottom flight i turned
and saw messieurs connor and chapman
on the balcony above they were in argu-
ment and seemed quite angry hold
mes enfants i called to them cease your
dispute and join me in a drink it will
dissolve your troubles as a cup of coffee
melts a lump of sugar

  monsieur chapman would have none
of it perhaps he was one of those un-
fortunates who have no love for brandy
it might have been he did not choose to
drink with monsieur connor at any
rate he went into his room and closed
the door while monsieur connor joined
me in the dining-room

  messieurs he bent another quick
smile at the jurymen have you ever seen
a man unused to liquor making the at-
tempt to seem to like it it is laughable
is it not so it was last night this one
-he laid a patronizing hand upon young
connors shoulder-he tipped his glass
and poured the brandy down then made
a face as though it had been castor oil
ah but he had the gameness as you say
so quaintly over here when i essayed a
second drink he held his glass for more
and when i took a third he still desired
to keep me company but then he scarce
knew what he did three glasses of
good cognac-he fairly smacked his lips
upon the word-are not for one who
does not give his serious thought to drink-
ing no certainly

  before you could pronounce the name
of that monsieur jacques robinson our
young friend here was drunk mordieu
it was superb not in more than twenty
years have i been able to achieve such
drunkenness messieurs he staggered
his head hung low between his shoulders
and rolled from side to side he smiled
like a pussy-cat who has lately dined on
cream he toppled from his chair and lay
upon the floor

  i raised him up come monsieur i
told him this is no way to do you are
like a little naughty boy who creeps into
his fathers cellar and gets drunk on
stolen wine be a man monsieur come
to bed

  ah but he could not he could not
walk he could not talk except to beg me


weird tales

that i would not tell his fiancee about his
indiscretion and so i dragged him up
the stairs yes i who am not half his
size must carry him upstairs strip off his
clothes and leave him snoring in a drunk-
en stupor he-

  then you think he couldnt a broke
th other fellers neck a juryman de-
manded with a grin

  de grandin left his place walked
across the chapel till he faced his ques-
tioner and leant above him speaking in a
confidential whisper which he neverthe-
less managed to make audible throughout
the room my friend he answered
solemnly he could not break the bow of
his cravat i saw him try it several times
at last i had to do it for him

   the verdict of the jury was that ralph
chapman came to his death at the hands
of some person or persons to them un-
known

db grandin poured a thimbleful of
old courvoisier into his brandy
sniffer rotated the glass a moment then
held it to his nose sighing ecstatically
you know my friend he told me as he
sipped the cognac slowly i often won-
der what became of them it was a case
with possibilities that one i can not rid

my mind of the suspicion-

  whatever are you vaporing about i
cut in testily what case and what sus-
picion-

  why that of mademoiselle bushrod
and her fiance the young monsieur con-
nor i-

   you certainly lied phil connor out of
the electric chair i told him with a
smile if ever i saw a death-trap closing
in on anyone it was the snare the coroner
had laid for him whatever made you do
it man didnt you want to see justice
triumph

   i did he answered calmly but jus-

tice and law are not always cousins ger-
man my friend justly neither of those

young folks was responsible for-

  beg pardon sor theres a lady an
gentleman askin fer doctor de grandin
interrupted nora mcginnis from the
doorway a misther connor an miss
bushrod will i be showin em in i
dunno

  by all means cried de grandin
swallowing his brandy at a gulp come
friend trowbridge the angels whom we
spoke of have appeared

phil connor looked embarrassed a
darkling haunted fear was in vir-
ginia bushrods eyes as we joined them in
the drawing-room

  the young man drew a deep long
breath like a swimmer about to dive into
icy water then blurted you saved my
life sir when they had me on the spot
last month now weve come to you
again for help somethings been troub-
ling us ever since ralph chapman died
and we believe that youre the only one to
clear it up

  but i am honored said de grandin
with a bow what is the nature of your
worriment my friends whatever i can
do you may be sure ill do if you will take
me in your confidence

  young connor rose a faint flush on
his face and shifted from one foot to the
other like a schoolboy ill at ease before
his teacher its more a matter of your
taking us into your confidence sir he
said at length what really happened on
the night ralph chapmans neck was
broken of course that story which you
told was pure invention-even though it
saved me from a trial for murder--but
both virginia and i have been haunted by
the fear that something which we do not

know about happened and-

  how do you say you fear that some-
hands of the dead



thing which you do not know about-

he began but virginia bushrod cut in
with a question

  is there anything to the freudian
theory that dreams are really wish-fulfil-
ments doctor ive tried to tell myself
there is for that way lies escape but-

  yes mademoiselle de grandin
prompted as she paused

  well in a misty hazy sort of way i
recollect i dreamt that ralph was dead
that night and that-oh i might as well
tell everything i dreamt i killed him

  it seemed to me i got up out of bed
and walked a long long way along a dark
and winding road i came to a high
mountain but oddly i was on its sum-
mit without having climbed it i de-
scended to the valley and everything was
dark then i sat down to rest and far
away i heard a strain of music it was
soft and sweet and restful and i thought

how good it is to be here listen-
  
ing-

  pardon mademoiselle can you recall
the tune you heard de grandin asked
his small mustache aquiver like the whis-
kers of an alert tom-cat his little round
blue eyes intent on her in an unwinking
stare

  why yes i think i can im totally
tone-deaf you know utterly unable to re-
produce a single note of music accurately
but there are certain tunes i recognize
this was one of them the londonderry
air

  ah the little frenchman flashed a
warning look at me then and what
else did you dream he asked

  the tune i listened to so gladly
seemed to change i couldnt tell you
what the new air was but it was some-
thing dreadful-terrible it was like the
shrieking and laughing of a thousand
fiends together-and they were laughing
at me they seemed to point derisive fin-

gers at me making fun of me because id
been insulted by ralph chapman and
didnt dare resent it

  i dont suppose youve ever heard of
the canadian poet service doctor but
somewhere in one of his poems he tells
of the effect of music on a crowd of min-
ers gathered in a saloon

   the thought came back of an ancient wrong
      and it stung like a frozen lash

   and the lust arose to kill-to kill   

  thats how that dream-tune seemed
to me the darkness round me seemed to
change to dusky red as though i looked
out through a film of blood and a single
thought possessed me kill ralph chap-
man kill ralph chapman he called you
a low cheat before your friends tonight
kill him for it-wring his neck

  then i was climbing up the mountain-
side again clambering over rocks and
boulders and always round me was that
angry bloody glow like the red reflection
of a fire at night against the sky at last
i reached the summit weak and out of
breath and there before me sleeping on
the rocks was ralph chapman i looked
at him and as i looked the hot resent-
ment which i felt came flooding up until
it nearly strangled me i bent over him
took his throat between my hands and
squeezed pressed till his face grew bluish-
gray and his eyes and tongue were start-
ing forward oh he knew who it was
all right before i gave his neck the final
vicious twist and felt it break beneath my
fingers like a brittle stick thats bent too
far i saw the recognition in his eyes-
and the deadly fear in them

   i wasnt sorry for the thing id done
i was deliriously happy id killed my
enemy avenged the slight hed put on
me and was nearly wild with fierce ex-
ultant joy i wanted to call everybody
and show them what id done how those
who called virginia bushrod thief and
cheat were dealt with


weird tales

her breath was coming fast and in
her eyes there shone a bright and
gleaming light as though the mere recital
of the dream brought her savage exalta-
tion the womans mad i told my-
self a homicidal maniac if ever i saw
one

  and then mademoiselle i heard de
grandin ask soothingly

  then i awoke my hands and brow
and cheeks were bathed in perspiration
and i trembled with a sort of chilled re-
vulsion girl youve certainly been on a
wish-fulfilment spree in shut-eye town
i told myself as i got out of bed

   it was early not quite five oclock
but i knew there was no chance of fur-
ther sleep so i took a cold shower got
into my riding-clothes and went for a
long gallop i argued with myself while
riding and had almost convinced myself
that it was all a ghastly dream when i met
you and doctor trowbridge having
breakfast

  when you mentioned hearing the
londonderry air the night before i went
almost sick the thought crashed through
my brain music at midnight-music at
midnight-music luring me to murder
then when the butler ran out on the
terrace and told you ralph was dead--
precisely mademoiselle one under-
stands de grandin supplied softly

  i dont believe you do she contra-
dicted with a wan and rather frightened
smile for a long time-almost ever
since my accident-ive had an odd op-
pressive feeling every now and then that
i was not myself

  eh that you were someone else he
asked her sharply

  yes thats it that i was someone
different from myself--

  who by example mademoiselle
oh i dont know someone low and
vile and dreadful someone with the bas-

  est instincts who-whos trying to push
me out of myself

  de grandin tweaked the needle-points
of his mustache leant forward in his
chair and faced her with a level almost
hypnotic stare explain yourself-in the
smallest detail-if you will be so good
he ordered

  im afraid i cant explain sir its
almost impossible but-well take the
episode in the billiard room at colonel
merridews the night that ralph was
killed i gave him my word then and i
give you my solemn pledge now that
never before in all my life had i held a
billiard cue in my hand i dont know
what made me do it but i happened to
be standing on the terrace near the win-
dows of the billiard room and when i
heard the balls click i felt a sudden over-
mastering urge like the craving of a drug
fiend for his dope to go inside and play
it was silly i knew i couldnt even hit a
ball much less make one ball hit another
but something deep inside me seemed to
force me on-no thats not it it was as
though my hands were urging me she
wrinkled her brow in an effort to secure
a precisely descriptive phrase then

  it seemed as though my hands entire-
ly independent of me were leading-no
pulling me toward that billiard table
then when i had picked up the cue i had
a sudden feeling amounting almost to
positive conviction youve done this
before you know this game no one
knows it better but i was in a sort of
daze as i shot the balls around i didnt
realize how long id been playing or
even whether id done well or not till
ralph accused me of pretending ignorance
of the game in order to win five hundred
dollars from him

  that-isnt all id hardly been out of
the hospital a month when one day i
found myself in rodenbergs department

                     w t-
hands of the dead



store in the act of shoving a piece of
chantilly lace under the jumper of my
dress i cant explain it i didnt realize
 was doing it-truly i didnt-till all
of a sudden i seemed to wake up and
catch myself in the act of shoplifting
virginia bushrod what are you doing

i asked myself then held the lace out to
the sales girl and told her i would take it
i didnt really want it had no earthly use
for it but i knew instinctively that if i
didnt buy it i would steal it

  abruptly she demanded do you ap-
prove of brightly-colored nails

  tenez mademoiselle that depends
upon the time and place and personality
of the wearer he responded with a smile

  thats it the personality she an-
swered bright carmine nails may be
all right for some theyre not becoming
to my type yet ive had an urge almost
an irresistible desire from time to time to
have my nails dyed scarlet last week i
stopped in madame toussaints for a
manicure and pedicure when i got home

i	found the nails of both my hands and
feet were varnished brilliant red i never
use a deeper shade than rose and was
horrified to find my nails all daubed that
way yet somehow there was a feeling of
secret elation too i called the salon and
asked for heloise whod done my nails
and she said i thought it strange when
you insisted on diat vivid shade of red
miss bushrod i didnt like to put it on
but you declared you wanted it

  perhaps i did but i dont remember
anything about it

  de grandin eyed her thoughtfully a
moment then

  you have spoken of an accident you
had mademoiselle tell me of it if you
please

  it was a little more than a year ago
she answered id been over to the coun-
try club by morristown and was hurrying
w t-

back to keep a date with phil when my
car blew out a tire at least i think thats
what happened i remember a sharp
crackling pop like the discharge of a
small rifle and next instant the roadster
fairly somersaulted from the road i saw
the earth rush up at me then-she
spread her shapely hands in a gesture of
finality-there i was pinned beneath
the wreckage with both hands crushed to
jeily

  yet you recovered wholly thanks to
doctor augensburg i understand

  yes it wasnt till every surgeon we
had seen had said hed have to amputate
that father called in doctor augensburg
and he proved they all were wrong i
was in the hospital two months most of
the time completely or partly uncon-
scious from drugs but-her delicate
long-fingered hands spread once again
with graceful eloquence-here i am
and im not the helpless cripple they all
said id be

   not physically at any rate de gran-
din murmured softly then aloud

  mademoiselle take off your brace-
lets he commanded sharply

  had he hurled an insult in her face
the girl could not have looked more
shocked surprize anger sudden fear
showed in her countenance as she repeat-
ed take-off-

  precisement the little frenchman
answered almost harshly take them off
tout promptement i have the intuition
what you call the hunch

   slowly reluctantly as though she were
disrobing in the presence of a stranger
miss bushrod snapped the clasps of the
wide bands of gold which spanned her
slender wrists a line of untanned skin
standing out in contrast to her sun-kissed
arms encircled each slim wrist testifying
that the bracelets had been worn on beach
and tennis court as well as in her leisure


weird tales

moments but whiter still livid eldritch
as the mocking grin of broken teeth
within die gaping mouth-hole of a skull
there ran around each wrist a ring of cica-
trice an indi or so above the styloid pro-
cess protuberance running up and down
a half an inch or so from the encircling
band of white were vertical scar-lines in-
terweaving overlapping as though the
flesh had once been cut apart then sewn
together in a dove-tailed jointure

   involuntarily i shrank from looking on
the girls deformity but de grandin scru-
tinized it closely at length

   mademoiselle please believe i do not
act from idle curiosity he begged but
i must use the fluoroscope in my examina-
tion will you come with me

  he led her to the surgery and a mo-
ment later we could hear the crackling of
the crookes tube as he turned the x-ray
on

miss bushrods bracelets were re-
placed when they returned some fif-
teen minutes later and de grandin wore
a strangely puzzled look his lips were
pursed as though he were about to whis-
tle and his eyes were blazing with the
hard cold light they showed when he
was on a man-hunt

   now my friends he told the lovers
as he glanced at them in turn i have
seen enough to make me think that what
this lady says is no mere idle vagary
these strange influences she feels these
surprizing lapses from normal they do
not mean she suffers from a dual person-
ality at least as the term is generally used
but unless i am more mistaken than i
think we are confronted by a situation so
bizarre that just to outline it would cast a
doubt upon our sanity alors we must
build our case up from the ground

  tell me he shot the question at
young connor was there anything un-

usual-anything at all no matter how
trivial which occurred to mademoisaile
bushrod a month-two months-before
the accident which crushed her hands
the young man knit his brow in con-
centration no-o he replied at length
i cant remember anything

  no altercation no unpleasantness
which might have led to vengeful
thoughts perhaps the frenchman
prompted

  why now you speak of it young
connor answered with a grin i did have
a run-in with a chap at coney island
ah describe it if you please

   it really wasnt anything ginnie and
i had gone down to the island for a spree
we think the summers not complete
without at least one day at coney-shoot-
ing the chutes riding the steeplechase and
roller coasters then taking in the side
shows this afternoon wed just about
completed the rounds when we noticed a
new side show with a professor mys-
terioso or mefisto or something of the
sort listed as the chief attraction he
was a hypnotist

  ah de grandin murmured softly

and-

  the professor was just beginning his
act when we went in he was extraor-
dinarily good too uncannily good i
thought all dressed in red tights like
mefistofeles he was and his partner-
subject you call it dont you-was a
girl dressed in a white gown with a blond
wig simulating marguerite you know
he did the darndest things with her--
put her in a trance and made her lie
stretched between two chairs with her
neck on one and heels on the other with
no support beneath her body while six
men stood on her told her to rise and she
rose up three feet in the air as though
drawn by invisible wires finally he took
half a dozen long sharp knitting-needles
hands of the dead



and thrust them through her hands her
forearms even through her cheeks then
he withdrew them and invited us to
search her for signs of scars it was mor-
bid i suppose but we looked and there
wasnt the faintest trace of wounds where
he had pierced her with the needles nor
any sign of blood

  then he called for volunteers to come
up and be hypnotized and when no one
answered he came down among the
audience you madame he asked
ginnie stopping in front of her and
grinning in her face

  when she refused he persisted told
her that it wouldnt hurt and all that sort
of thing finally began glaring into her
eyes and making passes before her

  that was a little bit too much i let
him have it

  bravo de grandin murmured soft-
ly and then

  i expected hed come back at me for
he picked himself up and came across the
floor with his shoulders hunched in a sort
of boxers crouch but when he almost
reached me he stopped short raised his
hands above his head and muttered some-
thing indistinctly he wasnt swearing
at least not in english but i felt that he
was calling down a curse on us i got
virginia out before we had more trouble
with him

  and that was all de grandin asked
  that was all

  parbleu my friend i think it is
enough to be significant then abrupt-
ly this feminine assistant did you
notice her

  not particularly she had a pretty
rather common sort of face and long
slim graceful hands with very brightly
painted aails

  de grandin pinched his pointed chin
between a thoughtful thumb and finger
where did doctor augensburg repair

your injured hands mademoiselle he
asked

  at the ellis sanitarium out by hack-
ensack she answered i was in mercy
hospital at first but the staff and doctor
augensburg had some misunderstanding
so he took me out to ellis clinic for the
operation

  the little frenchman smiled benignly
on the visitors i can understand your
self-concern mademoiselle he told miss
bushrod this feeling of otherhood this
impression that a trespasser-in-possession
is inside of you displacing your person-
ality making you do things you do not
wish to do is disconcerting but it is not
cause for great alarm you were greatly
hurt you underwent a trying operation
those things shock the nervous system i
have seen other instances of it in the
war i saw men make what seemed com-
plete recovery only to give way to strange
irregularities months afterward eventu-
ally they regained normality so should
you within let us say-he paused as
though to make a mental calculation-
within a month or so

  you really think so doctor she
asked pathos looking from her amber
eyes

  but yes i am all confident of it

ame of a most unpleasant small
blue devil he swore as our visi-
tors footstep faded on the cement walk
outside i must make good my promise
to her but how-death of a dyspeptic
hippopotamus-how  

  what i demanded

  you know how dreams relwct the out-
side world in symbolic images by ex-
ample you have kicked the covers off the
bed you are cold but you are still asleep
how does the dream convert the true
fatfs into images by making you to
think that you are in the arctic and a


weird tales

polar storm is raging or perhaps that
you have fallen in the river and are
chilled by the cold water so it was with
mademoiselle bushrod she dreams she
stands upon a mountain top that is when
she leaves her chamber she dreams that
she descends the mountain that is when
she walks downstairs she hears a tune
of course she does her hands those hands
which can not play a single note when she
is waking produce it she dreams she
reascends the mountain - climbs the
stairs ha then she sees before her her
traducer sleeping helpless she reaches

forth her hands and-

  what then my friend are we to
trust the symbolism of the dream still
farther

  but i began and-

   but be damned and stewed in hell
eternally he cut in altendez-moi
those hands those lovely graceful hands
of hers are not her own

  eh i shot back not-good lord
man youre raving what dye mean
precisely what i say he answered in
a level toneless voice those hands
were grafted on her wrists as the rose is
grafted on the dogwood tree her radii
and unlae have been sawn across trans-
versely then other bones processing with
the wrist-joints of a pair of hands were
firmly fastened on by silver plates and
rivets the flexor muscles spliced with sil-
ver wire the arteries and veins and nerves
attached with an uncanny skill it is
bizarre incredible impossible but it is so
i saw it with my own two eyes when i
examined her beneath the fluoroscope

he left the house directly after
breakfast the next morning and did
not reappear till dinner had been waiting
half an hour

  sacre nom he greeted me across his
cocktail glass what a day i had my

friend i have been busy as a flea upon a
dog but what i have accomplished par-
bleu he is a dever fellow this de gran-
din

  i took down copious mental notes
while mademoiselle bushrod talked last
night and so this morning i set out for
coney island grand dieu des rats what
a place

  from one small show-place to another
i progressed and in between times i en-
gaged in conversation with the hangers-
on at last i found a prize a jewel a
paragon he rejoices in the name of
snead-bill snead to give him his full
title-and when he is not occupied with
drinking he proclaims the virtues of a
small display of freaks eh bien by the
expenditure of a small amount of money
for food and something more for drink
i learned from him enough to put me on
the trail i sought

  professor mysterioso de diablo was a
hypnotist of no mean parts i learned he
had played big time for years but by a
most unfortunate combination of events
he was sent to prison in the state of mich-
igan the ladys husband secured a
divorce monsieur le professeur a rigidly
enforced vacation from the stage

  after that his popularity declined un-
til finally he was forced to show his art
at coney island side shows he was a
most unpleasant person i was told prin-
dpally noted for the way he let his fan-
cies for the fair sex wander this caused
his partner much annoyance and she
often reproached him bitterly and pub-
licly

  now attend me carefully it is of
this partner i would speak particularly
her name was agnes fagan she was
born to the theatrical profession for her
father michael fagan had been a
thrower-out of undesired patrons in a
burlesque theater when he was not ap-
hands of the dead



pearing as a strong man on the stage or
lying deplorably drunk in bed the
daughter was educated something ele-
gant my informant told me she was
especially adept at the piano and for a
time entertained ambitions to perform in
concert work however she inherited one
talent if no other from her estimable
parent she was astonishingly strong
monsieur snead had often seen her amuse
her intimates by bending tableware in
knots to the great annoyance of the
restaurant proprietor where she happened
to perform she could he told me sol-
emnly take a heavy table fork and twist
it in a corkscrew

   eh bien the lure of the footlights was
stronger than her love of music it ap-
pears for we next behold her as the
strong woman in an acrobatic troupe
perhaps it was another heritage from her
many-sided sire perhaps it was her own
idea at any rate one day while playing in
the city of detroit she appropriated cer-
tain merchandise without the formality of
paying for it two police officers were
seriously injured in the subsequent pro-
ceedings but eventually she went to
prison was released at the same time that
the professor received liberty and became
his partner the subject of his hypnotism
during his performances and according
to the evil-minded monsieur snead his
mistress as well

  she possessed four major vanities
her musical ability her skill at billiards
her strong white even teeth and the
really unusual beauty of her hands she
was wont to show her strength on all oc-
casions her dental vanity led her to
suffer the discomfort of having a sound
tooth drilled gold-filled and set with a
small diamond she spent hours in the
care of her extremities and often bought
a manicure when it was a choice of pam-
pering her vanity or going without food

  now listen carefully my friend
about a year ago she had a quarrel with
her partner the professor i recite the
facts as monsieur snead related them to
me it seems that the professor let his er-
rant fancies wander and was wont to in-
vite ladies from the audience to join him
in his acts usually he succeeded for he
had a way with women monsieur snead
assured me but eventually he met re-
buff he also met the fist of the young
ladys escort he was to use your quaint
american expression knocked for a row
of ash-cans by the gentleman

  la fagan chided him in no uncertain
terms they had a fearful fight in which
she would have been the victor had he
not resorted to hypnotism for defense
she wuz about to tear him into little bits
when he put is hand up and said
rigid monsieur snead related an
there she was stiff as a frozen statoo wid
er hand up in th air an her fist all
doubled up not able to so much as bat
a eye she stood that way about a hour
i expect then suddenly she fell down flat
and slept like nobodys business i reckon
th professor gave her th sleepin order
from wherever he had beat it to he had
got so used to orderin her about that he
could control her at a distance most as
well as when he looked into her eyes
thereafter he was often absent from
the show where he performed eventual-
ly he quit it altogether and within a
month his strong and pretty-handed part-
ner vanished like pouf she was sudden-
ly nowhere at all

 y the time the estimable monsieur
-u snead had finished telling me these
things he could impart no further in-
formation he was as i have heard it de-
scribed stewed like a dish of prunes for
all the while he talked i kept his tongue
well oiled with whisky accordingly i


weird tales

bid him farewell and pushed my research
elsewhere i searched the files of the
journals diligently endeavoring to find
some clue to the vanishment of mademoi-
selle fagan cordieu i think i found it
read this if you will be so good

  adjusting my pince-nez i scanned the
clipping which he handed me

girl falls unconscious with
strange malady
collapses on roadway near hackensack-
absence of disease symptoms
puzzles doctors
hackensack n j sept -police and doctors
today are endeavoring to solve the mystery of the
identity and illness of an attractive young woman
who collapsed on the roadway near here shortly
after noon today and has lain unconscious in the
ellis clinic ever since

   she is described as about  years old five feet
two inches tall and with fair complexion and red
hair her hands and feet showed evidences of un-
usual care and both finger- and toe-nails were dyed
a brilliant scarlet in her upper left eye-tooth was
a mall diamond set in a gold inlay

  she wore a ring with an oval setting of green
stone gold earrings in her pierced ears and an
imitation pearl necklace her costume consisted of
a blue and white polka-dot dress white fabric
gloves a black sailor hat with a small feather and
black patent leather pumps she wore no stockings

  alec carter and james heilmann proprietors
of an antique shop facing on the road saw the
young woman walking slowly toward hackensack
staggering slightly from side to side she fell in
the roadway across from their store and when
they reached her she was unconscious failing to
revive her by ordinary first aid methods they
placed her in an automobile and took her to the
ellis clinic which was the nearest point where
medical aid could be secured

   physicians at the clinic declared they could find
no cause for her prolonged unconsciousness as she
v-as evidently neither intoxicated nor under the
influence of drugs and exhibited no symptoms of
pny known disease

  nothing found upon her offered any clue to her
identity

   well i demanded as i put the clip-
ping down

  i do not think it was he answered
by no means not at all consider if
you please

  mademoiselle bushrods accident had
occurred two weeks before she had been
given up by local surgeons augensburg
vvho was at the ellis clinic at the time
had just accepted her case

  this strange young woman with the
pretty hands drops down upon the road-
way almost coincidentally with mademoi-
selle virginias advent at the clinic do
you not begin to sniff the odor of the
rodent

   i dont think so i replied

  very well then listen the mysteri-
ous young woman was undoubtlessly the
fagan girl whose disappearance oc-
curred about this time what was the so
mysterious malady which struck her
down which had no symptoms other
than unconsciousness it was merely that
she had been once again put under the
hypnotic influence my friend you will
recall that the professor could control her
almost as well when at a distance as when
he stared into her eyes certainly as-
suredly she had become so used to his
hypnosis that his slightest word or wish
was law to her she was his slave his
tiling his chattel to do with as he
pleased unquestionably he commanded
her to walk along that road that day to
fall unconscious near the ellis clinic to
lie unconscious afterward eventually to
die impossible mais non if one can
tell the human heart to beat more slowly
and make it do so under power of hypno-
sis why may one not command it to cease
beating altogether still under hypnotic
influence so far as the young fagan per-
son was concerned she had no thought
no will no power either mentally or
physically which the professor could not
take from her by a single word of com-
mand no certainly

  we were told mademoiselle bush-
rods accident came from a tire blow-out
nest-ce-pas i do not think it did i in-
quired--most discreetly i assure you-at
and near the ellis clinic and discovered
that monsieur the hypnotist visited that
institution the very day that she was hurt
had a long conference with doctor au-
hands of the dead



gensburg in strictest privacy and-when
he came he bore a small high-powered
rifle he said he had been snake-hunting
me i think the serpent which he shot
was the tire of mademoiselle bushrods
car that was the blow-out which caused
her car to leave the road and crush her
hands my friend

  now again this professor of the
devil as he called himself appropriately
visited doctor augensburg at several
times he was in the room where jthe
unknown woman lay on more than one
occasion he was at the clinic on the day
when augensburg operated on mademoi-
selle bushrods hands-and on that day
not fifteen minutes before the operation
was performed the unknown woman
died she had been sinking slowly for
some days her death occurred while or-
derlies were wheeling our poor mademoi-
selle virginia to the operating-room

  you will recall she was unknown
that she was given shelter in an institu-
tion which maintains no beds for charity
or emergency patients but did you know
that augensburg paid her bill and de-
manded in return that he be given her un-
claimed body for anatomical research that
he might seek the cause of her strange
death no you did net know it nor did
i but now i do and i damn think that in
that information lies the answer to our
puzzle

  i do not have to tell you that the
period between somatic death-the mere
ceasing to live-and molecular or true
death when the tissue-cells begin to die
is often as long as three or four hours
during this period the individual body-
cells remain alive the muscles react to
electrical stimuli even the pupils of the
eye can be expanded with atropin she
had suffered no disease-infection this
unknown one her body was healthy but
run down like an unwound clock more-

over fifteen minutes after her death her
hands were histologically speaking still
alive what easier than to make the
transplantation of her sound live hands
to mademoiselle bushrods wrists then
chop and maim her body in the autopsy
room in such a way that none would be
the wiser

  and what of these transplanted
hands they were part and parcel of a
hypnotic subject were they not accus-
tomed to obey commands of the hypnotist
immediately even to have steel knitting-
needles run through them yet feel no
pain yes certainly

  very well are it not entirely pos-
sible that these hands which the profes-
sor have commanded so many times when
they were attached to one body will con-
tinue to obey his whim when they are
rooted to another i think so

  in his fine story your magnificent
monsieur poe tells of a man who really
died yet was kept alive through hypno-
sis these hands of mademoiselle fagan
never really died they were still tech-
nically alive when they were taken off-
who knows what orders this professor
gave his dupe before he ordered her to
die those hands had been a major van-
ity of hers they were skilled hands strong
hands beautiful hands-helas dishonest
hands as well-but they formed a large
part of their owners personality might
he not have ordered that they carry on
that personality after transplantation to
the end that they might eventually lead
the poor mademoiselle bushrod to entire
ruin i think so yes

  consider the evidence mademoiselle
bushrod is tone-deaf yet we heard her
play exquisitely she had no skill and no
experience in billiards yet we saw her
shoot a brilliant game for why should
she whose very nature is so foreign to the
act steal merchandise from a shopkeeper


weird tales

yet she tells us that she caught herself in
such a crime whence comes this odd
desire on her part to have her nails so
brightly painted a thing which she ab-
hors last of all how comes it that she
who is in nowise noted for her strength
can twist a silver table fork into a cork-
screw

  you see he finished the case is
perfect i know it can not possibly be so
yet so it is we can not face down facts
my friend

   its preposterous i replied but my
denial lacked conviction

  he read capitulation in my tone and
smiled with satisfaction

  but cant wt break this spell i
asked surely we can make this pro-
fessor whats-his-name-

   not by any legal process he cut in
no court on earth would listen to our
story no jury give it even momentary
credence yet-he smiled a trifle grimly
-there is a way my friend

  what i asked

  have you by any chance a trocar in
your instruments he asked irrelevantly

  a trocar you mean one of those
long sharp-pointed hollow needles used
in paracentesis operations

  precisement tu paries mon vieux
why yes i think theres one some-
where

  and may one borrow it tonight
of course but-where are you going
at this hour

  to staten island he replied as he

placed the long deadly stiletto-like nee-
dle in his instrument case do not wait
up for me my friend i may be very late

horrified suspicion growing rapidly
to dreadful certainty mounted in
my mind as i scanned the evening paper
while de grandin and i sipped our coffee
and liqueurs in the study three nights
later read this i ordered pointing to
an obscure item on the second page

  st george s i september -the body of
george lothrop known professionally on the
stage as prof mysterioso hypnotist missing from
his rooming-house at bulls head s i since tues-
day night was found floating in new york bay
near the st george ferry slip by harbor police
this afternoon

   representatives of the medical examiners office
said he was not drowned as a stab wound prob-
ably from a stiletto had pierced his left breast
and reached his heart

  employees at the side show at coney island
where lothrop formerly gave exhibitions as a
hypnotist said he was of a sullen and quarrelsome
disposition and given to annoying women from
the nature of the wound which caused his death
police believe the husband or admirer of some
woman he accosted resented his attentions and
stabbed him afterward throwing his body into
the bay

  de grandin read the item through with
elevated brows a fortunate occurrence
is it not he asked mademoiselle
bushrod is now freed from any spell he
might have cast on her-or on her hands
hypnotic suggestion can not last once the
hypnotist is dead

 but-but you-that trocar- i

began

  i returned it to your instrument case
last tuesday night he answered will
you be good enough to pour me out a
little brandy ah thank you my friend

weird tales

remains i hoped you would help me
but ive one more ace in the hole-ti
fong

  hes a very fine man to dodge said
captain daunt as your brother could
tell you maybe if he could speak to you
im not afraid his fast yacht has
been seen in the vicinity of the red god
island and ive shown you the message
picked up in a floating bottle and assured
you ive checked the drift and the bottle
could easily have come from that cursed
island i believe my brother is there
daunt dont you understand its more to
us than settling the estate which cant be
done until his death is proved or legally
admitted his wife and my mother are
taking it hard nicks son born since he
disappeared

  i know all that and im sorry but
there is nothing i can do about it said
captain daunt

  you call at the island of the red god
you could get permission from jornado
to let me land and search captain
daunt was shaking his head when mo-
bray burst out then im off to sumatra
to see ti fong

  make your will said captain daunt
your brother tangled with that devil
afraid of the chink captain
enough to let you get away with that
remark because i feel sorry for your moth-
er and your wife or sweetheart go
along ive warned you and im busy
taking two black panthers to his highness
the maharajah of awroot up-country
nice cats he opened a door of an ad-
joining cabin and mobray saw two thick-
er shadows in the room corner with blink-
ing emeralds for eyes one yawned his
pink throat and red muzzle set with
fanged ivory

  beauties mobray backed toward
the door however that mouth looked
like an orchid of rare color captain

  genus man-trap said captain
daunt they roam this island youre in-
terested in though these were hand-
raised from cubs listen my lad would a
trip with me delivering these keep you
from tangling with worse which is one
description of ti fong not that it mat-
ters to me what happens to you only i
hate letting him add you to his collection
of odd achievements we are foes as
you might put it politely

  id like the trip with the cats captain
daunt and the skipper was aware
mobray thought it might provide a chance
to obtain further information in case ac-
quaintance proved amicable

  the big chromium-plated car of the
maharajah waiting for him on the wharf
with a uniformed chauffeur under the
wheel was searing the eyes of all behold-
ers in the hot singapore sunlight cap-
tain daunt exchanged his cap for a
panama whistled to the leopards who
stretched yawned again and undulatingly
slid within reach of leather collars he
snapped around their necks holding the
chains in his hand

  mobray stepped lively going to the
deck daunt sauntered along talking to
the cats which showed uneasiness at the
crowded wharf and glittering automobile
it took soothing to keep them beside
him while the car hummed through traffic
and shot into the empty road down the
peninsula mobray was ahead with the
chauffeur

the car rolled into a walled court and
was received with some pomp a
short time later mobray and captain
daunt were entertained by the resplendent
potentate in his best british manner and
the leopards lapped milk from a golden
basin and stretched supine before he
left daunt put them through a few tricks
most pleasing of which was a feline waltz
black bagheela



on their hind paws and leaping high to
capture a flower daunt tossed in the air
the prince was delighted and presented
captain daunt with a black pearl in ad-
dition to the high price paid for the leop-
ards and after due courtesies the visitors
were escorted to the car and whirled
away

   so thats part of the treasures of the
red god island said mobray trained
leopards why cant you trust me
enough

   my lad i rather like you it isnt that

ive orders- he interrupted himself

to speak to the driver put me down at
ira singhs the gold-beater  if you
want to see pretty jewelry mobray come
along ill have this pearl set for use

  in the bazar mobray watched captain
daunt select a pendant setting on a chain
of fine gold for his pearl an ornament
for a woman which was boxed for him
the native said something mobray did
not understand

  wait outside and well go somewhere
for dinner said daunt ill pay for
this trinket he says i am foolish to be
walking with you mobray which means
whoever got your brother is watching you
ira singh is a friend of mine

  mobray walked down the block gazing
at bazars lighted in the early darkness
looking like pirate caves of colorful loot
he walked back up and down and finally
entered ira singhs bazar daunt-sahib
was gone said an obsequious clerk but
hard on his words came a native police of-
ficer barging into the place the clerk
yelped and took to his legs a crowd after
him the singular occurrence alarmed
mobray he hailed a ricksha and was
driven to the wharf and daimts vessel
the gang-plank was drawn in but mo-
bray leaped the intervening lane of water
and climbed over the rail he ran down
to daunts cabin which was dark snap-

ping a cigarette lighter he entered be-
hind him the door was banked shut and
a lock grated he was a prisoner be-
side the lock an iron bar clanged though
he could have sworn there was none on
the door when he entered that noonday

  the throb of engines jarred the vessel
there were shouts and running feet over-
head and the navy man knew they were
being towed stern-first into the stream
bound god alone knew where he took
it philosophically he wanted a trip to
daunts source of valuable cargo and the
asiatic trickery of unknowns had granted
his wish by an odd twist of adventure
captain daunt would be surprized to see
him probably if he didnt drop him at
the nearest opportunity

  but mobray was not destined to see
captain daunt for that cruise he sight-
ed landmarks through his porthole the
spire of st andrews cathedral tanjong
ru and tanjong kantong the straits
islands dark against a moonlighted sea
praos flitting like black moths through
webbed waves and silver and he slept
soundly

next morning his door was unlocked
and opened by a tall urbane chi-
nese speaking excellent english who
listened to mobrays protest

  you came on board uninvited mr
mobray captain daunt is not on the
vessel he is the guest of the lord ti
fong

  mobray controlled a grin of satisfac-
tion at the joke on daunt who warned
him about the mysterious ti fong

  no need of keeping me a prisoner
he said im a navy man quite willing
for a voyage and rather anxious to meet
this ti fong i obtained leave of ab-
sence to search for my brother out here
the chinese nodded

  and a bottle was found containing a


weird tales

message from him from the island of the
red god where we hope to land lieu-
tenant mobray

  you know the whole story evidently
and youre going there good im in
luck anything i can do

  in the absence of captain daunt per-
haps you would be willing to fill his posi-
tion on the vessel

  look here youve taken this craft
over piracy you cant expect me to
head your villainy you know ive been
abducted

  could you prove that statement in a
court of inquiry asked the bland asiatic
and mobray considered before answering
into a space of silence came the suave
voice of the chinese you are search-
ing for sir nicolas mobray who came out
here to obtain a pair of celestial singers
to adorn his fine english estate the
fame of those birds has stirred ornitholo-
gists to their lees a pair of them among
the white and purple peacocks of athel-
stane would make sir nicolas the proud-
est peer in britain

  you know my brother is alive shot
from mobray

  the splendor of the celestial sing-
ers went on the chinese took centuries
to produce the eighteen-foot tail of the
cock of ku the coloring of the peacock
the song of the nightingale  a man
would commit crimes to possess them
mobrays throat tightened his scalp be-
gan to prickle premonition crawled over
his courage nick was in bad with these
chinks perhaps their prisoner nick had
the lordly scorn of white men for asiatics
and was unfamiliar with the sinister ven-
geance of the east

  who are you broke from him

  loo yee doctor lieutenant mobray
i assure you of your brothers existence on
the island of the red god where no ves-
sel may drop anchor except this schooner

rocks protect the island and the sea leaps
like wolves on three sides unfathomably
deep guns guard the lagoon andiorage
but this vessel with a white man on the
bridge may run in so we are glad to have
you take command and use your oppor-
tunity to search the island for your
brother and breakfast is waiting us

  mentally limp mobray followed to a
good meal hearing the interesting conver-
sation of doctor loo yee on everything
except the things vital to himself while
he cogitated his predicament trapped
nick alive on the island where only this
boat could anchor guilty of piracy if he
accepted loo yees terms    well to
hell with quibbling hed sail in and find
nick

  im with you he announced inter-
rupting politics from loo yee though
daunt will accuse me of piracy and his
word is as good as mine i cant expect
my abductor to speak in my defense
either i suppose

  you are erecting future bridges to
cross wait for those until you have seen
the celestial singers and the black ba-
gheelas dancing in the jungle

  from that hour the voyage was a pleas-
ant adventure outwardly though mobray
knew trouble was coming the cold
black eyes of loo yee held the unblinking
malignancy of a snakes his brilliant
conversation covered unplumbed hellery
afoot there were dark stains on deck
and in the crews quarters never obliter-
ated which looked like blood and savored
of wholesale slaughter of daunts crew
when the vessel was seized

  mobray wearing one of daunts drill
suits and a gold-banded cap was a mere
nautical figurehead when the vessel sight-
ed the island far out in the indigo blue
sea stretched a white spit on which
squatted an amazing image carved of red
rock from which the island was named
black bagheela



palms shimmered behind a coral beach of
the lagoon mountains rose farther back
dark with jungle growth the island was
shaped like a severed black hand with a
thumb and forefinger forming the anchor-
age and on that thumb the red god
squatted

the throb of drums came over the sea
at a great distance and grew loader
more menacing as they approached
doom    doom    doom    went a
giant drum through affrighted agitation
of smaller tom-toms behind the red
god the sun dropped in a blaze on the
sea and fires on shore winked through
the palms on the vessel evil-looking
dyaks put on fancy sashes and wore
waved knives the formidable kriss of the
race that fathered piracy it meant slaugh-
ter and mobray was the traitor leading
death to the island loathing his role he
was helpless to escape it

  you will go ashore alone unham-
pered said loo yee they expect cap-
tain daunt may your search prove prof-
itable being unexpectedly detained cap-
tain daunt put you in charge of his
vessel

  a boat was lowered from shore a
booming voice hailed the ship a small
fire was lighted on the coral beach and
mobrays hair rose as he saw the slouch-
ing form of a great ape among natives
peering over the water as he rowed the
boat nearer

  all dressed up daunt came as if
words zoomed from the pipes of an
organ

  mobray held the dripping oars an
ape spoke he couldnt believe his eyes
and ears frankly frightened he backed
the boat a gun cracked from the ship
a bullet whined and kicked up coral dust
natives at a snarl from the ape dashed
into the lagoon water and seized him

shots came thickly from loo yees men
as mobray was dragged ashore and up the
coral to sheltering shrubbery

  im not daunt of course he panted
daunt disappeared a chinese named
loo yee has his vessel    abducted me
   forced me to land my name is
mobray

  the paws of the ape held him claws
dug into the flesh of his shoulders slid
nearer his windpipe

  mobray boomed that incredible
voice how do i know you arent lying
whats your word worth the claws
were around his throat his hands tugged
at the hairy wrists of the ape uselessly
his breath was going

  my brother nicolas  is here he
gasped better fight loo yee    and
his gang    than me    take me to
   jornado    tell him-

  then he was flung to the natives and
the great ape was giving orders like an
army captain a howl like a beasts broke
from his throat quivered in the night
above the unceasing noise of drums
echoed on distant rocks mobray was
borne swiftly through darkness and rus-
tling growth to lights the sound of bab-
bling water the dark wall of a house
lamps revealing a room with heavy
dutch furniture natives wearing only
loin-rags held him bound him to a mas-
sive chair with a high narrow back the
lashings around arms and trunk and legs
held him motionless his feet were be-
tween the lower rungs high above the
floor and he was helpless to move any-
thing but his head

  turning that he saw a divan along one
wall heaped with cushions and on it a
woman queerly handsome hybrid with
long-lidded eyes of a manchu skin of a
white woman on a taboret near by burned
a flame on a small silver lamp the pe-
culiar odor of poppy gum transcended


weird tales

flower scent coming through open doors
and windows

  but mobrays head turned again as a
girl came down wide stairs wrapped in
a flowered silk sarong to her arm-pits
young lovely her dark eyes startled as
she saw him an instant later a cannon
boomed the lamp flame swayed a
sharp cry broke from the girl she ran to
the woman on the couch spoke and mo-
bray decided her speech was chinese
getting no reply she approached mobray
gliding on bare feet tinkling as she came
shaking a circlet of golden bells on her
ankles

   english she asked and as he nodded
she went on who are you where is
captain daunt why are the cannons
shooting

  all hell was breaking loose in the
jungle after each blast of the big gun the
trumpeting howl of great apes from near
and far gathering closer streaking past
toward the lagoon shores the girls eyes
were bright with alarm as she ran to the
door and stood peering into further dark-
ness calling once or twice in words mo-
bray did not understand even in that
tumult and the chaos of his thoughts
mobray had eyes for her young loveli-
ness but he felt his hair standing on its
roots when out of the night a sinuous em-
bodiment of gloom flowed to a place be-
side her bright-flowered sarong and lifted
its rounded head under her spread fingers
mobray stared at those fingers with their
almond-shaped nails like pink pearls rub-
bing the blackness of a leopards head as
unawarely as if it had been a house dog

  a second black beast appeared twin
emeralds glowed in pairs beyond the
door moving up and down back and
forth mobray counted a dozen and for-
got to count because one was gliding as
the clouds travel toward the couch where
the older woman lay it took time to

bare its teeth and hiss at him and the girl
turned leaped caught the beast by the
neck scruff and spoke sharply to mo-
brays terrific relief the leopard sat on its
tail beside the couch and allowed the
woman to fondle its head and seemed
listening to an explanation from her re-
garding the man bound to the chair

ttt or gods sake let me loose begged
-t mobray or call off those cats

   you do not answer complained the
girl querulously

   i was too scared to speak my name

is mobray my brother sir nicolas-

but she halted his words by the change of
her face

   you--you are sir nicks brother
come here to find him oh he hoped
you would come

   then he is alive

  captain daunt where is he why
dont you speak your tongue is not
tied

   i was taken prisoner on daunts ves-
sel by chinese i know nothing of him
except that he is the guest of ti fong
they said

   ti fong cried the woman on the
couch instantly wrenched from dreami-
ness that not even the apes howling had
disturbed the living gloom that slipped
inside the door on feet of silence was
electrified by the womens fear

   call off your cats begged mobray
if they kill me you wont know about
the danger coming with ti fong

   the girl whirled spoke beat their
black muzzles with her small folded fists
drove them outside mobray faced the
older woman whose one hand held the
neck of the leopard at her side

ti fong can not come here she said
challenging him to contradict her only
daunts vessel may enter the lagoon
that may be true but they evidently
black bagheela



abducted captain daunt ti fongs men
are on his vessel in the lagoon now unless
they have landed and it sounds to me
as if your cannons were so busy sinking
the boat they are giving ti fong plenty
of chance to make a landing im a navy
man and my ideas run to nautical tactics
and sea warfare its only a guess   
but where is jornado who owns and runs
this island he ought to be told im no
friend to ti fong i assure you id like
to be in the fight to keep him from land-
 
ing

   a quick exchange of words between
the two brought action the girl snatched
a knife from somewhere and cut his
bonds

   get me a gun and do something about
the leopards

   i go with you tuan

   im not a tuan nick has the title
im dick mobray may i ask your name
itll be handier to know it

  mayala jornado and this is my
mother

   jornados daughter mobray said
and turned to the mother you will not
regret cutting my lashings im on jor-
nados side

   a moment later he realized the foolish-
 ness of his speech the leopards trailed
 him and the girl as she seized his hand
 and ran down a jungle trail too dark for
 him to find a way toward the lagoon
 the worst din was over but yowls from
 the trees made him aware of the great
 apes in those upper terraces on shore a
 big fire lighted a shambles what re-
 mained of dyaks of the crew fallen
 into the apes hands daunts men were
 avenged and his vessel lay shorn of her
 upper works after the guns finished with
 her mobray was too late to fight the
 girl led him toward two huge orang-
 outangs at the edge of the firelight who
 stared as he approached mobray hated

 the quiver of his flesh that seemed coward-
 ice but the dismembered flesh of dyaks
 revolted him and showed the way apes
 disposed of humans

   then a cry froze his blood

  dick one ape came toward him
still staring and in those eyes he saw rec-
ognition and surprize human attributes
dick    oh god you dont know me
 no wonder    dicky its me   
what they made of me    your brother
nick    that devil ti fong  i tried
to buy his cursed birds    then lost my
head and tried to take them  wait till
youve seen them dick but im talking
too fast    my brain isnt what it used to
be   dick    you cant believe  no
wonder and the ape slouched away
shamed slumping toward a palm bole
where it leaned the great shoulders heav-
ing in anguish its forehead against one
arm along the tree

  mobray stood rooted to the spot with
terror that he had lost his own reason
that his mind facing incredible horror had
snapped it was the girl who went and
laid a hand on the arm of this monstrosity
and spoke softly that steadied his nerve

  there seems no doubt you are lieu-
tenant richard mobray boomed from
the other ape sir nicolas recognizes you
   and my name once was ornado like
your brother i offended ti fong who
makes apes of us both youll believe
what seems impossible presently mo-
bray just as i believed that-he pointed
to a headless torso of a dyak on the coral
sand - when he said ti fong took
daunts vessel made daunt his prisoner
and sent the vessel here unfortunately
the dyak didnt know the rest of the
scheme but we havent seen the end of it
yet they didnt land intact because you
gave warning for that i am grateful
well go to the house now youve had
a shock that needs digesting to believe


weird tales

  you    you killed them all doctor
loo yee also asked mobray he was
startled at the sudden rage of the man-
ape

  loo yee no the surgeon cleverest
of them all nick you hear that loo
yee was on board hes escaped us
and the man-ape called jomado howled
to the apes in the trees in their lingo mo-
bray saw the leopards sniff at human flesh
and turn away daintily but the smell of
blood affected them jornado caught the
neck of one and flung the animal savagely
toward the jungle the others disap-
peared after it

  again the girl grasped his hand and
they returned to the house where natives
brought brandy and a glass for mobray
and he drank a tumblerful before his flesh
ceased quivering

  come out here where its dark dick
called the voice of his brother the same
inflections the tones magnified and mo-
bray sat on the porch hearing the dreadful
tale of master surgery that dealt worse
than death and after-hells to sir nicolas
mobray

  ive got one hope dick that i can go
through it again and have this brain this
ego restored to the body of a human you
could do that for me you could round
up those devils and force them to operate
again otherwise death is the only way
out

  in the darkness mobray clutched hope
he lost his horror of this uncouth shape
that spoke his brothers thoughts and
asked so tenderly about nicks wife and
little son loo yee was on the island and
would be captured he said with child-like
optimism the jungle was as silent as it
had been noisy

  you go to bed dick in the big front
room that was mine i like sleeping in a
tree better tomorrow youll see the
birds

  a servant showed mobray to a room
with an old four-poster bed and heavy
furnishings shipped to the island a cen-
tury before when the dutch were strip-
ping its lagoon of pearls its jungle of
birds of paradise before they abandoned
it and-for services rendered a high offi-
cial-it came into the possession of jor-
nado mobray heard from his brother
how jornado had stolen the pair of celes-
tial singers from ti fong and was cap-
tured and his brain transplanted into the
skull of a huge orang-outang before he
was landed on the island

at dawn mobray was awakened by
bird songs of such singular ecstasy
that he went to the window fine wire
screened an enormous expanse of gardens
with orange trees in flower and golden
fruit drapes of wine-red bougainvillea
flame trees hibiscus and the seductive
perfume of ylang-ylang on tall perches
birds of shimmering plumage poured
forth their love-songs their long tails
swaying with iridescent colors to the car-
pet of flame-tree petals beneath jorna-
dos daughter was holding cupped hands
filled with rice and she saw him and
beckoned by her smile the night horror
might have been a bad dream pleasantly
ended by morning

  dressed he came down to watch her
feed the celestial singers sun dappled
the gardens made living jewels of the
birds and an eden of the old stone house
despite its incongruous solidity in a tropic
setting that called for airy bamboo build-
ing the stoop flanked a pool fed from
a mountain stream ripe oranges fell
from the trees and plopped into the water
bounded down the steps those soft
sounds like the ghost echoes of drums that
had boomed in the night recalling reali-
ties in a dream nuance that began when
jornados daughter finished feeding the

                     w t-
black bagheela



birds and sat beside him on the old stone
steps that were tilted by crowding jungle
roots

  he had fallen under the spell of youth
a girls beauty and soft voice the passion-
ate wooing of tropic beauty in lush
growth and forgot she was a mystery his
mind refused to accept jornados daugh-
ter until she spoke of those things

  all night i worried about captain
daunt he is our friend tell me what
happened to him

  mobray mentioned the trip with the
black leopards to the maharajahs palace
the visit to the jewel-shop

  probably he had that big pearl made
into an ornament for you he said but
i never dreamed of a girl on the island
of the red god    never of a girl like
you mayala

  i was born here just a few days be-
fore jornado was brought here-as you
see him he stole ti fongs daughter
who is my mother and ti fongs celes-
tial singers and ti fong never forgets
he is a terrible man my mother feared
him and her mother feared him and
killed herself to escape from him though
she was his wife

  ti fongs daughter--your mother
he murmured

  and she is clever like him but not
cruel come and see her with the leop-
ards    the bagheelas  

  she led him through green tunnels of
ferns and flowering vines where the air
was perfumed and moist as warm wet
gauze mobray thought they came miles
to the clearing a natural glen of grass
above which vines grew from tree to tree
in a green trellis heavy with flowers hang-
ing like colored flames at the edge of
the clearing they halted leopards lay
or stalked back and forth or sat around
ti fongs daughter who pulled their ears
rubbed their pelts talked to them in a
w t-

crooning purr resting and when she
rose and lifted her hand a tom-tom began
throbbing a little flute played a tune the
players hidden beyond the vines and ti
fongs daughter coaxed the leopards to
leap over her head she coaxed them to
form figures like circus tumblers with a
row of cats resting their paws against one
another and others on their backs until
the pyramid loomed high and an agile
young cat bounded to the top and stood
erect at her word the towering wall of
velvet crumpled and became cats again
dancing on their hind paws leaping to
swipe at hanging orchids or crunch them
in their scarlet muzzles

  mobray watched entranced forgetting
everything but the sight then as ti
fongs daughter made a circle of the cats
the girl beside mobray clutched his fin-
gers and touched her own lips in a warn-
ing gesture though he had been motion-
less hardly breathing

  in the circle ti fongs daughter knelt
under flickering shadows threaded with
sun-gold the drums beat faster the
flute was silent watching intently mo-
bray lifted a hand to rub his eyes where
the woman had crouched a black leopard
sat and the woman was nowhere leger-
demain but clever as magic the cat
danced as no leopard ever danced gor-
geously swaying twirling on her hind
paws spinning until there was a dark
nimbus swelling as a humming top seems
to spread then diminishing as mobray
watched until he saw it was not a leopard
but the woman whirling and the black
fur blanching to the color of her flesh and
dark sarong he had time to notice the
circle of leopards ears laid back fangs
bared scarlet muzzles twitching snapping
at empty air as a dog will snap if his
master blows in his face as if they sensed
the dreaded powers of darkness evoked
by her who ruled them and when the


weird tales

weird spell broke they slunk mewing
nearer her and fawned their tails drag-
ging the grass

  mayalas hand was drawing him back
over the path

  if i could only do as she does the
girl sighed i dance with them but i
can not become one of them

  mobray opened his lips to say it was
a trick an optical illusion but changed
his impulse because of a howl that rang
out suddenly the cry of a great ape boom-
ing vibrating on the quiet heat silencing
the myriad sounds of rustlings and insects
in the jungle and the twittering of birds
the song of celestial singers was broken
off coming near the wire enclosure he
saw the birds heads under their wings as
they gripped the high perches

  something has happened cried the
girl running

mobray ran after her to a break in the
trees where they could see the long
white thumb of coral and the red god
like a grotesque setting of a thumb-ring

  streaking the blue sea leaping like a
stone ricochetting over the waves from the
speed at which it flew was a power-
launch and kshed to the stern was a
barred cage from which a voice howled

  mobray knew that voice he froze in
his trades at its message booming over
the water growing fainter dying away

  jornado they trapped me its nick
mobray ti fongs launch came in dur-
ing the fight and lay hidden look   
ti fongs boat    out there

  forgetting the girl mobray raced
toward the spit staring where that bound-
ing power-launch flew to a rendezvous
with a vessel barely discernible

  the island was all noise the bedlam
of the night tore loose again but mo-
bray was staring focussing his gaze at
sea and he saw the vessel low rakish

streaked black and white like an orca
turning abeam to glide along as the
launch slowed down

  a cannon shot crashed a puff of
smoke floated and broke and vanished
there vas a splash where the ball fell
short of ti fongs vessel and before an-
other shot was fired the cage was swung
on her the launch was towing behind and
she streaked for the far horizon

  mobray was scrambling up the feet of
the red god climbing to its knees and
shoulders by rough apertures of its crude
carvings he stood beside the great ear
shorter than its hanging lobe staring at
the sea the tropic sun blazing on his bare
head his senses swimming dazedly and
he saw the man-ape called jornado swing-
ing toward the god and swarming up be-
side him

  you saw growled the mighty voice
you heard they outwitted us but how
could i guess ti fong sent in daunts
steamer with his own men to have us busy
fighting them away while he sent in the
launch to lie hidden god knows what
devils it has landed well have to scour
the jungle to find them they cant
escape but the pity is that nick your
brother is in ti fongs hands again it
means a more hellish vengeance your
brother tried to take ti fongs pair of
celestial singers as i took the parent pair
the birds were killed making sir nick
into a companion for me is not enough
for ti fong you heard what he cried
out at first

  mobray couldnt speak the man-ape
jornado swung beside him the mighty
voice had the organ sorrow of a requiem
the eyes held grief but the sea for mo-
bray was heaving up and down the long
white spit was waved like a kriss to his
eyes

   jornado he called shoot and end
me    dont let ti fong put me in a cir-
black bagheela



cus  he says- then they must

have hit him though he yelled again as
you heard growled jornado

   nick gasped mobray a circus a
moment later he slumped and was sliding
down the shoulder of the red god a huge
hairy arm caught him from that fall and
mobray was carried through the jungle
to the house over the shoulder of jornado
the ape

he wakened on the stoop lying on
a couch in the ineffable peace of
that perfumed shade mayala was lifting
his head holding a lime drink to his lips
his hands grasped her felt the warm
strength of her wrists clung because they
were blessed flesh and blood and youth
and things he could comprehend

   the sun was too much for you she
murmured

   not the sun    hells devils mys-
teries    and nick his voice cracked
on his brothers name he sat up still
grasping the girls arms tell me ive
dreamed assure me none of it happened
ive been whanged on the head and lost
my mind

   no no youre quite well the sun
on the red god is always fierce the red
rock draws heat

   she did not understand that he craved
a denial of what happened and he
thought the lime drink was drugged for
the spasm of horror passed and he lay
in a languid waking coma hearing the
oranges plop and splash as they fell into
the pool hearing distant sounds that did
not mean anything to him or matter until
the sun was low and there was no golden
spidery gleam of it on the pool

   mayala brought him food turtle broth
cold roasted chicken bread and fruit and
he ate hungrily she played on a silk-
stringed moon-shaped guitar and sang
little chinese love-songs for him and the

stars came out the moon rose presently
and the house was very still then she
left him and he went upstairs to bed and
wakened to the music of the celestial
singers and watched her feed them again
but there was a new distraction below

   a group of island natives came through
the jungle and interrupted the bird-feed-
ing they carried a man in a hammock
of twisted vines and came up the steps of
the stoop looking down mobray saw
it was a white man alive but utterly
spent dark hair streaked over his fore-
head and cheeks but mobray knew him
he ran down the stairs startled out of
lethargy and bad dreams

  the bearers halted at the door and
mobray laid a hand on the mans wrist
the weary head turned and the eyes
opened

   mobray whispered a croaking voice

  daunt came mobrays cry and the
bearer went inside to where jornado sat
in a great chair in the cool dark living-
room beside the silk cushions of the
couch where ti fongs daughter sat her
small ivory-tinted hand caressed by the
paws of the ape

  its captain daunt mobray cried as
the woman rose

  and about done for croaked daunt
the devil made me swim ashore after
they got what they came for hes put
it over again jornado my fault give
me some brandy and ill talk

  on the couch with natives massaging
his body with scented oils captain
daunts hoarse voice gathered strength to
tell his story from the time ira singh
warned him in the jewel shop he was
foolish to be in company with lieutenant
mobray

  somebody grabbed ira singh and
slugged me ti fongs men evidently
followed us after we got out of the ma-
harajahs car they move like eels any-


weird tales

way they got i-n the bazar and next
time i got breath i was being hustled with
a bag over my head to ti fongs yacht i
expected the worst but he wanted to use
me im more valuable to him at large
evidently he sent in my vessel knowing
youd use the cannons when you found
out the trick and he gave me my choice
of piloting his launch in while the noise
was loudest and hiding it or-well never
mind his alternative i took the safe way
for myself then i had to be a party to
the abduction of-your brother mobray
i wish to got it wasnt true i wanted
to live as i am somebody has to fetch
supplies here and take out cargo i guess
you know by this time whats been going
on jornado is my friend and partner
i failed to save him from ti fongs ven-
geance but im the only link between him
and his lady and mayala and necessities
 if it was just jornado hed get along
on the island but the women-

  mobray nodded he blamed daunt
for his forced treachery but recognized
the reason after all nick had blun-
dered into the vengeance of a master-devil
when he tried to take ti fongs remain-
ing celestial singers

  why did ti fong want sir nick
growled jornados voice

   hes insane of course said daunt
the most terrible madman ever spawned
by hell it suits his asiatic whim to sell
his captive to some zoo or circus as an
orang-outang able to speak a trained
ape weve got to stop it the minute
my vessel can navigate im after him
and i know every lane of the animal
cargo game i know all the dealers ill
head him off just let me get over that
swim and the coral scratches and get my
boat in shape and jornado you might
start men working on her you might
look over her and tell me how badly shes
damaged

while captain daunt slept in mo-
brays bed the others were on the
vessel with torchlights and the work of re-
pair was already begun mobrays career
jornados seamanship swarms of natives
whose forebears had sailed those seas in
beautifully built dugouts before the ro-
mans settled londinium were clearing the
wreckage and repairing the deck-house
and steering-gear the severed cargo
slings and emergency sailing-gear and
on the rail against the buxom figurehead
of the bows sat mayala plucking the silk
strings of her moon-guitar and singing
love-songs

  captain daunt slept the sun around
waking only to eat and drink and sleep
again the swim from ti fongs vessel
had been a test for his iron endurance
but the native massage the food and rest
restored him amazingly and he was work-
ing with the others on the third day after
he landed in a week the vessel was fit
for a cruise and during that week mo-
bray had explored much of the island
with mayala he had watched daily the
circle of leopards put through their tricks
he had seen again and again that trans-
formation of ti fongs daughter into the
guise of a leopard and restored again to
her own form almost he believed what
mayala said

  it is true many native people have
that gift i wish i could be a black ba-
gheela mobrays arm caught her closer

  you stay as you are some day youre
coming away from this island to see other

places    some day when nick-

he could not speak of his brother sanely
even yet

  but if i could become a black ba-
gheela i would go with you i would
break into ti fongs kampong and kill
him

   i wouldnt let you take the risk said
mobray but with the girl soft and warm
black bagheela



in his arms he was staring into the clear-
ing where ti fongs daughter crouched
the outlines of her form blurred darkly
trembling as she shook off human shape
and became a leopard dancing leaping
lithely to bring down hanging orchids and
bits of vine

   there were no tom-toms and flutes that
day to drive parokeets and lories from the
surrounding trees birds darted in drifts
of brilliant color from branch to branch
a big green parrot circled a vine and
hung upside-down above the dancing
bagheela a swipe of her paw struck it
lifeless and tossing it like a ball she
played as a cat with a mouse gay feathers
strewing the grass

  mayala caught her breath and drew
mobray silently away

  never have i seen her kill anything
before she is never cruel it shows she
is wholly bagheela not even her kindness
left of my mother how awful if she
should ever be hungry when she turns to
bagheela

  mobray tried to comfort mayala as
they sat on the stone steps of the pool
watching oranges bobbing the girl
seemed depressed by the metamorphosis
of her mother into a merciless cat killing
for amusement but mobray marveled at
the ancient witchcraft of the dark ages
and reeking jungles and forests

  captain daunt barged on their brood-
ing and dispelled it by handing the girl
a little box in it was the black pearl on
its chain which he dropped over her
head and said

  if i hadnt stopped to have the ma-
harajahs pearl fixed so you could wear it
we wouldnt be in this mess mayala
then what can i do to make up to you
captain she asked

   a pretty big favor let me sell a pair
of celestial singers to the maharajah

its going to take plenty to pay the price
ti fong will ask for his prisoner
captain daunt dont hesitate about
the price cried mobray i havent it
but his estate everything he has

  that would take time to negotiate
besides its my carelessness that let ti
fongs men on the island

  take the birds cried mayala only
they need such care on a voyage i must
go with them

  i thought of that not you mayala
perhaps your mother jornado wouldnt
let you go ive talked to him and we
agreed about it and from the thick
foliage of an ancient tree boomed the
voice of jornado

  sir nicolas was our guest and we let
that devil ti fong get hold of him we
must make amends so bibi-ti will go
with the birds she knows the cruelty of
ti fong as none of us do she is of his
house and knows the anguish of her own
mother who was ti fongs wife before
she killed herself to escape him she has
seen the world beyond these shores
where she has lived with grief for fifteen
years and never once complained or
wished aloud that she could return to the
land of the living perhaps she will find
amusement in seeing other places again
and other    people and the mighty
voice of jornado ended in a sigh of sor-
row a sigh of renunciation

  mobray felt the stark tragedy of jor-
nado as never before doomed to live in
his half-world neither man nor beast re-
taining the intelligence and fine attributes
of a man imprisoned in beast form
chained to the daily torture of hideous
grotesquery before the woman he loved
separated from her by worse than death
he was glad to be aboard the vessel in
the rush of last-minute preparations when
the big cage containing a pair of celestial
singers was carried beside the black-


weird tales

swathed figure of bibi-ti as the vessel
forged away they saw jornado standing
on the red gods shoulder with mayala
beside him waving

bibi-ti devoted herself to the birds un-
til the vessel docked at singapore for
captain daunt to go ashore it was an-
chored far from shore and a sharp watch
set with mobray in command ti fongs
spies would inform him of its arrival and
they feared the terrible power of his evil
tentacles reaching into every port

  there on deck watching the distant
city like a marble hand on the arm of the
long johore peninsula bibi-ti told mo-
bray of jornados tragedy the blue-
eyed red-headed sea captain had seen her
in her fathers house feeding the celestial
singers he had taken them and her as
mad a love idyl as the tropics ever fos-
tered and for weeks they were happy un-
til the day jornado disappeared captain
daunt took her to the island where in-
stead of her lover the soul and brain of
him was brought in the apes body just
before mayala was born

  i had my daughter or i should have
gone mad or killed myself and i
delved into the ancient mysteries that ti
fong taught me in childhood and prac-
tised them among the bagheelas

  daunts respect for her was profound
when captain daunt was rowed out to
the vessel bursting with news

  ti fong sold nick to the maharajah
i called on the nabob and hes complain-
ing of trickery he paid enormously and
his purchase refuses to talk and seems
dying refuses food the only good fea-
ture is that in the maharajahs court the
crowd cant gape and jeer and hell
look at the birds if they please him hell
buy ive got us an audience with him
t must go with you to coax the birds
to sing said bibi-ti

  of course daunt agreed

  she was wrapped in a black sari and
veiled like a moslem woman for the ride
to the maharajahs court and only on the
journey did daunt confide his most im-
portant news

  i asked him to have ti fong present
bibi-ti

  under the veil she trembled as daunt
assured her no harm could possibly come
of the meeting but both men walked
close to the veiled figure as they were
ushered into the court where the mahara-
jah sat beside the chinese a mere in-
clination of heads acknowledged the na-
bobs introduction their eyes were on
the hapless transformation of a once
proud peer chained to the bole of a living
tree its head lifted around the skull
was the puckered brand of its ignominy
the mark of surgical skill of the dread ti
fongs henchmen the dull eyes quick-
ened at sight of mobray the black lips
moved but only a croak of despair was
uttered and the shamed head drooped
again

  near the maharajah lay his two tame
leopards lazy as full-fed house-cats until
the visitors entered then they were
afoot ears back teefh showing in snarls
spitting as they glared at the veiled figure
the maharajah tried to soothe them be-
tween courteous amenities and explana-
tions

  captain daunt i have complained to
ti fong of a bad bargain the ape he
sold me does not speak but he has offered
to prove his claims for the creature today
as a dealer in rare animals i knew you
would be interested in my new posses-
sion

mobray was briefly fascinated by the
aspect of triumph in the yellow
mask of ti fongs face black eyebrows
cut horizontally across the dome-shaped
black bagheela



shaven poll the nostrils were dark
apertures of the flattened nose the lips a
thin dark line he wore a magnificent
robe embroidered in gold and green
dragons the wide sleeves concealing his
hands

  the ape shall speak you will hear
him beg for favors he said striding
toward the tree while the maharajah rose
and tried to quiet the spitting leopards
that glared with burning green eyes at
the quivering folds of bibi-tis wrappings
mobray saw the black veil fall

  not here not that dance here he
gasped at her but was too late the sari
dropped a black leopard began that
slow swaying dance of the jungle ter-
rible to watch in the court where punkahs
moved with restful pause and swing
peace-conveying where there was no
peace but only primal madness mon-
strous cruelty and impending doom pi-
ping to the danse macabre

  mobray did not see the whip in ti
fongs hands hurled high until the lash
whined through the air and the ape
howled and leaped as its chains clashed
and a long red snake oozed blood where
the lash had coiled around its body and
lifted skin

  you fiend you devil boomed the
agonized howl god dick shoot me
and end this misery i only want to die
quickly

  mobray leaped at the chinese but a
gun spat from his left hand a bullet in
his shoulder spun mobray around

  ti fong was running toward the iron
door-grilles firing again the dancing
leopard leaped a ribbon of soft flowing
red unfurled from her flank the tame
leopards were mad and the court seemed
full of snarling spitting cats there was
a mewing screech as one landed on the
apes shoulders the snap of jaws on a
spinal column a shake and an unearthly

screeching of the dancing bagheela as she
leaped in fury driving back a tamed cat
that had shaken the ape limp

   from the safety beyond the grilled iron
doors the maharajah saw his pampered
pets trying to climb the walls to escape
the she-leopard his court was a bloody
arena utterly cowed their tails lashing
their fangs showing they crouched while
the dancing leopard caught up the black
sari in her teeth and tossed it on her
hind paws she stood quivering and turn-
ing like a top the sari covered her
the white teeth and the red mouth
blurred before their eyes and as the spin-
ning slowed down they saw a womans
black hair white face and red lips

  she glided to the doors which his
highness opened and flew to the cage of
celestial singers her voice crooned her
hands caressed them while mobray knelt
beside the dying ape-man

  he lifted the grotesque head to his
shoulder seeing only the intelligent eyes
glazing fast hearing only the hoarse echo
of his brothers voice

  im glad it is ended dick forget
all this if you can im not suffering at
all ive heard that the big cats paralyze
by that neck hold odd adventure
wasnt it youll carry on till my boy
can take things over dont tell them
what happened and dont try to take
vengeance on ti fong its too risky   
dick  i fancy i hear music-

   in the outer court the celestial singers
broke into glorious melodic song and on
the wings of music the soul of a man in
torture escaped its prison of grotesque
flesh

  captain daunt heard a car roaring
away ti fong had escaped the sailor
stood with a hand at salute to death but
his mind was planning reprisals as the
maharajah slipped into the court and

snapped chains on the collars of his leop-
ards

  command me he said to mobray
anything in my power shall be done to
honor him who was your brother there
is a tomb in the grounds where lies an il-
lustrious warrior of my ancestors that his
presence would honor and its silence is
no deeper than shall be mine about what
i have seen today captain daunt any
price you name shall be paid for the celes-
tial singers that they may sweeten his rest
with their songs how may i serve you
and the lady further

  in the zenana the skin wound of bibi-
ti was dressed and she rested while a
flower-covered flag-wrapped form was
sealed in a tomb of carved marble with
priestly chanting and rites of honor

  when again daunt saw her she had

shed the last stoic silence of that alter ego
at her command

  take me home to jornado she
pleaded the circumference of earth is
all too short a distance to run from ti
fong had his aim today been as deadly
as his powers of darkness i would never
see my child and jornado again take me
home

  through the night roared the mahara-
jahs shining car with armed guards bring-
ing them to daunts vessel

  hes licked us again commented
captain daunt

  at least my quest for my brother is
ended said mobray ended in the
only way possible rest and peace for him
and i begin to see the oriental argument
for nirvana since asia spawns devils

of the cloven hoof

  by arlton eadie

a startling weird mystery story of strange deaths on the desolate
moor of exham and the mysterious creature known as
the terror of the moor

the story thus far

what is the real explanation of
the mysterious monster-horned
cloven-footed yet speaking with
a human voice-which haunts the deso-
late recesses of exmoor the problem
confronts hugh trenchard in a dramatic
guise when he stumbles on silas marie

lying stunned and helpless one misty
night and the subsequent disappearance
of the old mans body only serves to
deepen the mystery

  with the aid of a former fellow-
student ronnie brewster hugh deter-
mines to solve the mystery and his reso-
lution is strengthened when he learns that



this story began in weird taxes for july

   any moment the ball
might shatter and bring
death to both


weird tales

silas marie has bequeathed his entire for-
tune to him on that very condition ac-
companied by ronnie he motors to moor
lodge maries former home and in a
safe there finds a letter which seems to
give the clue to the origin of the terror
of the moor

  according to this statement marie had
discovered a method whereby the nitrogen
of the atmosphere combined with the
natural elements contained in every living
body might be utilized as a means of
wholesale slaughter the chemical for-
mula whereby this may be effected is con-
tained in a sealed envelope which hugh
replaces unopened in the safe

  maries letter further states that he had
taken into his employ a half-witted lad
known as crazy jake who having mem-
orized the formula was about to be-
tray it to professor lucien felger a sup-
posed secret agent in the pay of a foreign
power as the only means of preserving
the secret marie determined to use his
new invention on jake as he made his way
across the moor to felgers house

  the explosion completely destroys the
lower portion of jakes body and marie
leaving the remains lying on the moor
hurries home thinking his secret safe for
all time some six months later how-
ever he is horrified to see the face of his
victim gazing in at him through the win-
dow of moor lodge and when he ex-
amines the spot where the apparition
stood he finds the unmistakable trail of
cloven hoofs

  apparently eager to help hugh ron-
nie succeeds in casting suspicion on in-
spector renshaw a scotland yard man
who has been sent to investigate and
when that officer disappears with joan
endean ronnie openly declares that
renshaw is really professor felger in dis-
guise ronnie and hugh make their way
to felgers sanatorium and enter the cel-

lars where the so-called friend using a
cunning stratagem chains hugh to the
wall and boldly proclaims that he is the
professor himself having at last secured
maries secret formula he has manufac-
tured enough detonating gas to annihilate
a regiment and hugh is destined to be
the first victim of its deadly power



in spite of his iron self-control hugh
trenchards face grew a shade paler at
the calmly uttered threat he had not
been deaf to the hiss of venomous hatred
that had swept like a sinister undercur-
rent through the others words the man
was in deadly earnest short of a miracle
happening hugh was doomed

  yet he could have faced the adverse
fortune of war with greater stoicism if it
had been brought about by a fair duel of
wits his jaw tightened ominously as he
recalled how his faith and trust in ron-
nies much-protested friendship had en-
abled his false comrade and ally to throw
dust in his eyes with such ease and ef-
fectiveness all unknowingly he had
shown his opponent every card as soon as
it had come into his hand no wonder
the game had gone against him

  well mr brewster-or felger-or
brauschiitter-or whichever of your crook
aliases you prefer to be called by-ive
had the misfortune to knock up against
some pretty low-down skunks in my time
but i dont think theres one of them that
wouldnt feel physically sick if he had to
share the same jail-cell as you

  hugh was watching his man keenly as
he spoke and for an instant it seemed as
if his tone of withering contempt had
pierced the armor of his suave self-satis-
faction for the fraction of a second his
scowling brows met on a forehead to
which the hot blood had suddenly mount-
the trail of the cloven hoof



ed then he shrugged and laughed as
though his humor had been tickled by an
excellent joke

  i suppose your temper is still a bit
raw so i will make some allowance and
for the present overlook the bad taste of
ycrur last remark he said pleasantly
but it seems to me my dear doctor
trenchard that your quite natural irrita-
tion at finding yourself outwitted by a
more subtle mind than your own is mak-
ing you unappreciative of the delicate
finesse by which that result has been
achieved for instance take the method

by which i eliminated silas marie-

  then it was you who murdered him
professor felger lifted his shoulders in
a pitying shrug

  that is a fact which you certainly
should have discovered long before this
why i even went so far as to anticipate
that you would suspect me seeing that i
was the only person in the upstairs floor
of moor lodge at the time the only
precaution i took before striking the blow
was to make sure that miss endean had
already left the house and i was pleasant-
ly surprized at the readiness with which
you assumed her to be the guilty party
taking everything into consideration i
think you must admit it was a very neat
piece of work

  and so heroic hugh cried in atone
of biting sarcasm i wonder that you
are not ashamed to boast of the murder
of a helpless old man

  why should i have spared him why
should i have shown him more mercy
than he showed the half-witted lad who
had learnt his secret felger retorted in
swift defense the moment it suited
maries purpose he doomed crazy jake
to a horrible death and exulted when he
thought his secret was safe but jake did
not perish in the explosion i was await-
ing his arrival here and as soon as i heard

the report i guessed what had happened
and hurried across the moor until i came
to his body-or what remained of it no
wonder marie was certain that his victim
could not survive-he was a mere frag-
ment of a man but strangely enough
the head-the seat of the intellect and the
memory-was but slightly injured it
seemed the very essence of madness even
to dream of retaining life in such a mu-
tilated torso yet if i could do so i might
still learn the secret that he was on his
way to tell me that night i was desper-
ate and i took a desperate chance by a
stroke of great good fortune i had at the
time a large stag in my operating-room

i had been using the animal for a series of
experiments which though of great inter-
est to me would not have been appre-
ciated by those who administer your nar-
row-minded vivisection laws the ani-
mal was still living though the man was
to all appearances dead i resolved to at-
tempt what no other surgeon had at-
tempted before  

   professor lucien felger paused in his
narrative glanced at the watch on his
wrist and shook his head with an air of
disappointment as he continued

   i fear there is not sufficient time for
me to give you a technical description of
the operation or rather the series of oper-
ations which followed without undue
egotism i can assure you that my daring
and unprecedented conception deserves to
rank as the crowning triumph of recon-
structive surgery but do not imagine
that my triumph was lightly won for the
first three weeks after the beginning of
the experiment i did not snatch more
than twenty minutes sleep at a stretch
by day and by night i watched my pa-
tients-or perhaps i should say my one
composite patient--tending observing
taking notes and even photographs which
when embodied in my forthcoming work


weird tales

will electrify the whole scientific world
in the end the result exceeded my most
sanguine anticipations but i will not seek
to hide the fact that at least some of my
success was due to the undoubted atavistic
traits which existed in my human subject
jake was both mentally and physically
one of those curious throw-backs-rever-
sions to ancestral type-which occur now
and then subtle reminders to those that
have eyes to observe and brains to under-
stand of the former lowly origin of the
biped race which now dominates the
earth doubtless this accidental factor
explains the readiness with which the tis-
sues and sinews united and the almost
perfect functioning which resulted in the
union be that as it may i can claim
some credit for the centaur-like creature
which at last emerged-a creature with
the strength and fleetness of a stag com-
bined with the intelligence-naturally
small unfortunately-of a man the
fictitious frankenstein was supposed to
have created a monster-i in sober truth
have evolved from two distinct animal
types the monstrosity that has become
celebrated as the terror of the moor

hugh had listened in amazement so
absorbed in the fate of the half-
witted jake that he had forgotten his own
perilous situation

  you mean to stand there and tell me
you have linked a four-footed beast to the

body of a human being-

  half a body felger corrected grave-
ly-

  and condemned him to an existence
in that diabolical shape

  the professor laughed

  the shape is a mere accident due to
the only material i had at hand he ex-
plained soft-voiced and imperturbable
my one object was to preserve the mind
the memory of the shattered frame so

that i could learn the secret of the detonat-
ing gas but jake in his new form proved
sadly intractable he sulked and refused
to speak i had to humor him by allowing
him to roam the moors at night where
wearing a helmet made from the antlered
skull of the animal that had restored him
to life he indulged his crazy fancy by
proclaiming himself the king of the
moors it was on one of his excursions
that he met and fell in love with joan
endean

  he-what hugh trenchard cried
thickly a sudden surging fear almost
choking his utterance

  he happened to catch sight of her on
the night on which he carried off maries
body and her beauty completely captivat-
ed his crazy desire for whole weeks i
couldnt get a word out of him except
ravings about her shining hair her red
lips her smooth rounded limbs-

  cut it out curse you shouted
trenchard goaded beyond endurance by
the mental picture which rose before him

  felgers lips parted in a slow smile as
he saw the effect of his words

  that is precisely what i told jake at
the time he drawled but do you think
i could make the poor sap change his
tune he got more goofy every day and
began to throw out hints that he was
about tired of playing king-o-the-castle
all on his lonesome he wanted a little
playmate and he told me flat that he
wasnt going to talk about old maries
chemical formula until he got one but
i humored him a bit and finally got him
to promise that he would tell the secret of
the gas to joan endean well hes go-
ing to tell her tonight and im going to
be near enough to hear what it is

  tonight ejaculated trenchard its
you thats crazy-not jake dont you
remember that miss endean is far away
beyond your reach by now
the trail of the cloven hoof



  true felger answered and once
again hugh detected the note of mocking
triumph hidden in the silk-smooth tones
but a telephone message from your dear
old pal ronnie brewster telling her that
you were waiting for her here would soon
bring her flying into the trap like a little
fluttering bird

  hugh trenchard reeled under the
shock as his mind plumbed the depths
of the intended villainy against the girl
he loved his breathing became deep
and rapid as that of an exhausted runner
queer flashes of red appeared before his
staring eyes he tore at the constricting
chain with the fury of a maniac his
fingers itched to close about the throat of
the man who had masqueraded as his
friend

  you cad you foul unspeakable
cad in his fury hugh hurled every
scathing epithet which came into his
seething brain i thought you had some
dregs of honor and decency but now i
can see that you have never so much as
understood the meaning of either word
you filthy reptile-you fighter of
women

  the suave demeanor dropped from
felger like a cloak revealing the brute
beast beneath clenching his fist he
drove it full in the face of his helpless
captive laughing like an exultant fiend
as he saw him crash to the ground

  you shall pay for each one of those
words with an hour of exquisite agony
hugh trenchard in imagination you
shall die a thousand deaths before you
gladly welcome the real thing at the
finish wait till i return-then ill show
you something that will make the most
devilish device of chinese torture look
like a toy to amuse a kid wait-just
wait-thats all

  abruptly felger turned on his heel and
strode away trenchard saw the reflec-

tion of his electric torch grow dimmer and
dimmer then came the dull clang of a
distant door and he was alone in a dark-
ness which though impenetrable was not
blacker than his own despairing thoughts

his situation was such as might have
appalled the stoutest heart yet
things might have been worse at least his
hands and feet were free and the length of
the chain permitted a certain radius of
movement his electric flashlight still re-
mained with him though he dared not
avail himseif of its light now in case the
battery should fail later on when he might
need it badly his revolver of course was
in the professors keeping and he raged
inwardly when he recalled how neatly he
had been tricked into handing it over to
his enemy never before had he so ap-
preciated the inherent truth of the old
western adage when you need a gun
you need it badly

  but hugh trenchard was not one to
waste time yearning for the unattainable
as soon as he was satisfied that his captor
had really left him to himself his first
action was to make a thorough test of the
chain and the staple whidi secured it to
the stone pillar of his prison but a very
few minutes of strenuous exertion demon-
strated the unwelcome fact that he could
never hope to free himself without the aid
of a file or a specially tempered saw

  desisting from his vain attempt he
seated himself on the heap of straw and
gave himself up to reflection but his
every thought was a torture in itself
every second the suspense became more
intolerable any certainty however dread-
ful was to be preferred to these dragging
hours of haunting dread his enforced
inaction while his joan might for all he
knew be even then hastening toward the
net spread by felger was harder to bear
than the thought of his own approaching


weird tales

fate slowly but surely he felt that his
nerve was leaving him he was sure of it
when the sudden scurry of a rat in the
straw brought him to his feet tensed and
trembling

  come come he said aloud with a
laugh that was somewhat shaky this
will never do

   reseating himself on his bed of straw
he resolutely forced his thoughts into a
different channel by reviewing the events
that had happened since his first arrival
on exmoor the revelation that had
identified professor felger with ronnie
brewster was like the beam of a search-
light focussed on those hitherto dark and
mysterious crimes everything that had
confused and bewildered him was now so
clear that he marvelled how he had ever
been bafhed the seemingly supernatural
voice of the terror which he and joan
had heard in the library of moor lodge
had come from ronnie himself the let-
ter making the assignation at the devils
cheesepress which had so mysteriously
appeared on the hall-stand had been left
there by the same man who he remem-
bered now had been the last to leave the
house ronnie too had been in the vicin-
ity of the cheesepress when hugh had
been attacked and he had been careful to
get rid of the inconvenient presence of
sergeant jopling before the appointed
hour now he could understand how his
so-called friend had been able to appear
on the scene so promptly after he hugh
had been felled senseless to the ground

  it was no mystery now how ronnie
had managed to find the hidden door
leading to maries laboratory and of
course it was he who had held hugh up
at the pistols point and demanded the
key of the safe afterward it would have
been a simple thing for a man with ron-
nies medical training to fake a chloro-
form attack feign unconsciousness and

thus divert suspicion from himself but
the most brilliant master-stroke of the
whole elaborate plot was ronnies auda-
cious plan of disguising himself as the
professor-his real self in fact-and pre-
tending to enter the sanatorium even if
the truth had been suspected the fact of
his acknowledged disguise as the man he
was really impersonating would have
completely baffled discovery and exposure

  the riddle of dawkers strange words
when he had paid his stealthy visit to
moor lodge was now a riddle no longer
he had found out that ronnie and the
professor were one and the same and he
was trying to make capital out of his dis-
covery having failed with hugh he
had attempted to blackmail ronnie and
had been silenced for ever with a bullet
but-hugh saw it clearly now-the fatal
shot had been fired before ronnie had
rung up the police the report which had
sounded while the conversation was in
progress being merely that of a blank
cartridge which had been fired by ronnie
for the purpose of establishing his own
alibi afterward he had thrown the
weapon out of the window into the front
garden where it had been found by joan
just previous to her arrest there never
had been a third actor in that midnight
drama the story of a slightly built youth
like a girl in mans clothes being but a
cunning attempt to cast suspicion on joan
nor had ronnies ingenuity ended there
for after inspector renshaw had pretend-
ed to arrest the girl ronnie had con-
trived to convince both hugh and ser-
geant jopling that the detective was none
other than professor felger in disguise

  hugh trenchard held the master-clue
at last but at what a price had his
knowledge been bought the readiness
and completeness with which professor
felger had thrown off his mask was in it-
self an ominous sign never would he
the trail of the cloven hoof



have revealed his real identity unless he
was sure that his secret would soon be
buried in the grave a man who had al-
ready taken two lives to attain his purpose
would he be likely to shrink from a third
victim when that victim knew as much as
hugh trenchard

  thus far proceeded hughs train of
thought then like an overstrained harp-
string it snapped abruptly out of the
surrounding blackness with no sound of
gliding footstep or rustling movement to
herald its coming hugh felt the touch of
cold steel on his bare upturned throat



instinctively he threw up his hand
and grabbed at the hovering weapon
but to his utter amazement it receded be-
neath his touch as though it were float-
ing in the air hugh wrenched his flash-
light from his pocket slid the switch and
the mystery u as explained the steel that
had touched his throat was the blade of a
file which dangled at the end of a long
cord from a small round opening in the
vaulted roof nor was this all looking
down at him through the circular aperture
was the familiar face of detective-inspec-
tor renshaw of scotland yard

   snap off that light came the detec-
tives urgent command in a whisper just
loud enough to reach the ears of the
shackled man when hugh had obeyed
he went on rapidly get busy with that
file and work as you have never worked
before felger may be in on you at any
moment if you can manage to saw
through your chain before he comes
spring on him the moment he enters and
take him by surprize its your only
chance

   with unsteady fingers hugh untied the
cord which renshaw immediately pulled
up

  cant you let me have a gun he
begged

   im afraid i cant returned the detec-
tive ive loaned my shooter to miss
endean-maybe shell be needing it even
worse than you

  joan surely she has not ventured
into this place

  she surely has came the whispered
reply from above youll never find
that girl shirking her duty because of a
bit of peril why shes been carrying her
life in her hands for three months
her duty gasped hugh did you
say her duty

  i did and ill say more the girl you
know as joan endean is really the daugh-
ter of sir arnold edgeworth the chief of
the british secret service and shes one
of the smartest investigators on the job
she was sent down here not so much to
secure the secret formula for our govern-
ment as to prevent it falling into the
hands of a possible enemy i thought youd
queer her game unless you kept away
from her so i pitched you the yarn that
she was known to the police-which was
quite true though not in the usually un-
derstood sense shes got nerve has that
girl-she even got herself certified as a
lunatic in order to get inside that sana-
torium of felgers but things got too
warm and she was forced to make her es-
cape with her task unfinished shes back
again now though and im willing to bet
shell put paid to felgers long overdue
account before she quits the house
how did you find that trap-door in
the roof there

  she discovered that when she was here
last they used it for the purpose of low-
ering food to the terror when he was
stabled down there but theres no time
for talk work at that chain of yours
and work as though you were working for
your life


weird tales

  hugh trenchard needed no further
urging any form of exercise was a posi-
tive relief after his long spell of enforced
nerve-sapping inaction making a swift
circuit of the stone pillar so that the
tautened chain was forced against the
masonry as immovably as if it were in the
jaws of a vise he plied the file with a
fierce joy it was awkward at first work-
ing in the dark but as soon as the ser-
rated edge of the tool had bitten the first
slight groove the absence of light did not
trouble him much for a full hour he
worked without pause until the continu-
ous friction of his fevered strokes had
made the blade of the file too hot to be held
by the naked hand yet the notch in the
steel chain link that was the result of his
labor seemed disappointingly slight bare-
ly a quarter of the tough steel had been
sawn through at the same rate of prog-
ress it would take him another three
hours to complete his task

  but he had no intention of giving up
two minutes rest was all he allowed him-
self as a respite for his cramped and ach-
ing arm then he once again seized the
file and resumed his monotonous task
backward and forward-backward and
forward went the file its short sharp
grinding strokes sounding with the
mechanical regularity of a steam-driven
piston rod and at every stroke tiny grains
of the disintegrated steel went to swell the
little shining heap at the foot of the pil-
lar if it had not been for these indica-
tions he might have doubted whether he
was making any progress at all hope
and fear alternately possessed his mind as
he worked at his task-seemingly as end-
less as the labors of sisyphus

  backward--forward    backward-
forward backward-though his cramped
muscles felt as though they were con-
stricted by iron bands forward-though
the handle of the tool felt like a searing

iron against his blistered palm back-
ward-forward backward-

  above the low rhythmical grind of steel
against steel another and different sound
came to hugh trenchards ears it was
the noise of heavy bolts being drawn and
only too well he knew that it heralded the
return of professor felger desperately
he exerted his whole strength on the
chain but the half-severed link still held
firmly his labor had been in vain

  hastily thrusting the file into his pock-
et and throwing straw over the telltale
heap of filings he seated himself in such
a position as to conceal with his body the
portion of the chain on which he had been
working resting his bowed head on his
hand in an attitude of dejection that was
not wholly assumed the knowledge
that he had been so near to freedom made
his failure all the harder to bear yet
even in the bitterness of heart which that
knowledge brought trenchards keen
ears did not fail to note that the man who
had entered had not re-fastened the door
behind him if only he could convey that
intelligence to inspector renshaw or joan
she at least was armed and-

     ood evening doctor trenchard
vjt the smooth accents of professor
felger cut into his thoughts standing
well beyond the limit of the chain his
captor was regarding him with a mocking
smile so our noble hero is growing
despondent curious-is it not-what
an inferiority complex can be induced in
a naturally rebellious spirit by such a sim-
ple thing as a chain i fancy those nor-
man barons of bygone ages possessed a
much greater insight into psychology than
we give them credit for when they com-
pelled their serfs to wear a collar as the
symbol of servitude it is a fascinating
study this strange influence which a few
steel links have over the mental outlook of

                    w t-
the trail of the cloven hoof



the man on whom they are riveted and i
can but regret that i can not demonstrate
it more fully just now for one thing
there will not be time for another it
would be profitless to enlighten a mind
which will soon be incapable of appreci-
ating any knowledge still i can accom-
modate you with some light of a more
material nature

  professor felger raised his hand to a
switch that had hitherto escaped hughs
notice and immediately a single electric
globe in the vaulted roof burst into radi-
ance flooding the prison with its white
glare

  presently you will understand my mo-
tive in providing you with such an excel-
lent illumination felger went on
though it is extremely doubtful whether
you will thank me for it but it is neces-
sary for the success of the coming enter-
tainment that you should have the fullest
use of your eyes

  hugh trenchard made no reply but
his observant eyes did not fail to note
every one of the professors subsequent
actions and these were extraordinary
enough to have merited attention even if
they had been enacted under less sinister
conditions

  crossing to the center of the floor he
stooped and lifted up a hinged circular
slab of stone revealing a sunken funnel-
shaped basin in the middle of which was
a brass nozzle the professor reached
down and turned a tap and immediately
a fine jet of water sprang from the noz-
zle ascending about a yard into the air
before curving outward like a glittering
plume and falling in a shower of tiny
drops into the surrounding basin profes-
sor felger straightened and stood with his
hands in his pockets watching it with an
expression of placid satisfaction

   a pretty contrivance is it not he re-
marked at length i fear however that
w t-

you do not appreciate its full beauty-yet
wait until the basin is full of water then
ill show you something nothing alarm-
ing my dear sir nothing alarming-
merely a little demonstration of centrif-
ugal force

  when the water had reached the brim
of the shallow basin and was beginning
to escape through the drainage holes
which had evidently been placed near the
rim to prevent it overflowing felger
withdrew his hand from his pocket and
hugh saw with a sense of puzzled as-
tonishment that it was grasping a globe
of greenish glass about the size of an or-
dinary cricket ball

  without a word felger leant over and
carefully placed the transparent sphere in
the center of the tiny fountain where it
remained dancing up and down in the
grip of the continuous stream in precise-
ly the same manner as the colored balls
which form elusive targets in some shoot-
ing galleries

   at first sight it seems impossible that
such an unstable force as a rapidly mov-
ing column of water should be capable
of neutralizing the weight of the ball but
such a condition is maintained only so
long as the ball is accurately balanced as
it were in the center of the stream when
the erratic movements of the ball carry it
sufficiently co one side it topples over-
as it is about to do now-

  as he spoke the balls downward path
failed to bring it within the power of the
jet and it fell with a little splash into the
water in the basin professor felger
chuckled softly as he saw the bewilder-
ment reflected on hugh trenchards face
rack his brains as he might hugh failed
to grasp the meaning of this seemingly
senseless piece of childs-play

   oh our little game is not finished by
any means felger went on having
fallen into the water the centrifugal


weird tales

force once more comes into play bringing
the little ball nearer and ever nearer the
jet in the center until at last the upward
stream catches it and once more sends it
merrily aloft so--

  again the gleaming sphere began its
dance in the air again it escaped from the
stream and fell only to be again caught
and whirled upward not a word was
spoken by either of the men as they
watched the process repeated time after
time until a chance spurt of the fountain
having sent the ball a trifle higher than
usual it rebounded not into the water-
filled basin but onto the stone floor
where it was shattered in pieces

  and that my dear doctor trenchard
is the whole point of this little demonstra-
tion ninety-nine times out of a hundred
the glass ball will be precipitated into the
basin where the water will break its fall
and enable it to reach the jet again but
the hundredth time it will be projected
beyond the rim of the basin and will shat-
ter itself on the stone on this particular
occasion it has taken exactly nineteen and
one quarter minutes before the smash
came but my previous experiments have
shown that there is a great divergence in
the various times which elapsed before the
end came sometimes the ball would
dance uninjured for over an hour some-
times it would be shattered in a few
minutes it is pure chance whether it
takes seconds or hours it is in vulgar
parlance just a gamble as far as you are
concerned hugh trenchard its going to
be a gamble with death

  a cold sweat broke out on the forehead
of the fettered captive there was a suave
and devilish malignancy in the coldly pre-
cise voice of professor felger that was
more terrifying than any blustering threat

  speak out like a man-if you call
yourself one cried hugh why dont
you kill me now and end this torture

  felgers eyebrows flickered upward in
an expression of mild surprize

  my dear sir your-er-your little or-
deal has not so much as begun so far as
for my taking you at your word and kill-
ing you offhand that-considering the
novel means i intend to employ-would
be far too risky to my own life when at
last you quit this earthly vale of tears-
that is the nicest way of putting it that i
can call to mind on the spur of the mo-
ment-i shall be far away from here
knowing how completely i have succeed-
ed in fooling everybody connected with
this case you may well believe that i have
not overlooked the obvious precaution of
securing for myself what is vulgarly
termed a slick get-away long before the
little ball has finished its last gavotte i
shall be beyond the coasts of england
nor will i travel alone for i shall have a
very beautiful and interesting companion
in the lady whom you have hitherto
known as miss joan endean

  youll find your science is at fault
there hugh cried with a ringing laugh
joan would rather die a thousand deaths
than allow you to lay your filthy hands on
her she knows you for what you really
are

  indeed the professors tone ex-
pressed no more than the tolerance with
which one may explain an obvious thing
to an unruly child but have you stopped
to ask yourself how long she will continue
to know me for what i am an injection
of a few drops of the memory-stealing
datura obliterare and both my past mis-
deeds as well as the all-important formula
of the detonating gas will be wiped from
her mind as for yourself she will be
utterly unconscious that such a person as
hugh trenchard has ever existed

   you devil raged hugh vainly strain-
ing at his chain you fiendish devil

  spare your mouthings said felger in
the trail of the cloven hoof



a voice of cold contempt i have the
same dislike that every possessor of a
scientific mind has of mere empty forms
of speech be silent and listen to me
the glass ball with vhich i conducted the
last experiment was of course empty
but this-he carefully drew another
from his pocket and held it aloft for
hughs inspection - this one i say
though to all intents and purposes its
very counterpart contains a concentrated
liquid solution of the detonating gas in-
vented by the late silas marie before i
leave this room i shall place this glass
sphere on the jet of the fountain-and
you shall stand there chained and watch
it dance and when it ceases to dance
you will cease to live for the moment
the glass is shattered the gas will en-
velop you changing your living tissues
into a deadly explosive converting you
into a human grenade that will blow your
soul to eternity

  with a swift but precise movement he
placed the gas-filled sphere on the leap-
ing fountain then swiftly crossed the floor
at the door he paused and looked around

  farewell hugh trenchard he cried
with a mocking salute let me wish you
a swift and pleasant journey into the
great unknown my forthcoming jour-
ney with your sweetheart will not be so
swift as yours but it will be more pleas-
ant and there will be more certainty as
to the destination any last message for
the fair joan no then it only remains
for me to give you my parting benedic-
tion requiescat in pace

  the door slammed hugh trenchard
was alone with the dancing globe of
death



for several minutes hugh trenchard
stood rigid and motionless staring as
if hypnotized at the tiny sphere of glass

that leaped and gyrated under the impulse
of the glittering stream which issued from
the nozzle of the fountain suddenly he
bit his lip to restrain a cry of horror the
ball had missed the propelling jet of
water with widened eyes he followed its
downward plunge and a gasp of relief
escaped him as he saw it fall into the water
which bubbled in the hasin below yet it
had missed the stone margin by less than
an inch the narrowness of his escape
from death roused him to the necessity of
immediate action for only too well did he
know that the slightest impact of the glass
ball against a solid substance would mean
the shattering of the frail envelope the
release of the imprisoned gas and
then-

  he felt no inclination to follow his
speculations any further nor was there
anything to be gained by so doing while
life remained to him he must try his best
to circumvent the deep-laid plot of the
scientist whose misapplied genius had
evolved that elaborate and diabolical ap-
paratus of death henceforward work
must be his watchword now or never
must he exert his wits and muscles or
before long they would be stilled fokever
by the fate which must inevitably over-
take him if he delayed

  with an effort of will he tore his gaze
from the glittering ball which had justfre-
commenced its mazy dance in the air and
pulling the file from his pocket he ap-
plied it to the stubborn steel of his chain
he had worked hard before but now he
plied the tool with the frenzy of a mad-
man for he knew that he was striving for
something even more precious than life
itself joan-his joan-was in the clutch
of that scheming villain-even now she
might be vainly calling on him for the aid
that he would willingly have sacrificed his
life to give the maddening thought
nerved his flagging muscles to even great-


weird tales

er effort the blade of the file grew hot
beneath the continued friction of his
frenzied strokes its handle became moist
and slippery with the blood which oozed
unheeded from his raw and blistered
palm but the steady grind of steel on
steel continued without pause or falter
and accompanying it-a grim reminding
spur to his efforts-was the musical purl-
ing of the fountain which like a pretty
child innocently playing with a deadly
bomb alternately tossed and caught the
gleaming ball of death

  suddenly another sound came to hugh
trenchards ears from the direction of
the h-dden door came the slow stealthy
creaking of ponderous bolts being with-
drawn again he whipped the file back
into his pocket and threw himself on the
straw at the bae of the column a thou-
sand wild thoughts seethed in his brain
was it the professor returning scarcely
that for he would have no need to exer-
cise caution in his approach he thrust
the idea of felgers return from him and
knitted his brows in thought the next
instant he was on his feet his heart beat-
ing a wild tattoo his brain humming with
the reaction as despair gave place to re-
turning hope

  until that moment he had completely
forgotten that inspector renshaw was in-
side that house of mystery who else
would be likely to seek him out except
the man from scotland yard filled with
a certitude that his deliverance was near
hugh trenchard raised his voice in a joy-
ous shout

  help help this way inspector
come right in and hurry help

   but no cheery answering cry came from
the gloom which shrouded the door the
second bolt was drawn with the same
slow caution as the first then came the
creaking of hinges as the heavy door was
opened and after a pause closed again

still the mysterious visitant gave no aud-
ible sign of his presence yet hugh was
certain that some one had entered and was
watching him from the shadows

  who had come to him and for what
purpose was he about to be confronted
with a friend or a foe

  hughs straining eyes searched the
depths of the gloom that clustered about
the farther end of his prison and at length
his gaze was concentrated on a patch of
darker shadow which seemed to have
shifted slightly the next moment the
new-born hope was dead in his heart
from the shrouding darkness two faintly
luminous eyes were watching him fixedly
transfixed hugh stood motionless his
brain almost giving way beneath its
weight of horror as he realized that alone
unarmed and shackled to a chain of steel
he was at last face to face with the dread-
ed terror of the moor

then ensued a spell of unbroken
silence that was thick with unspoken
terror this last blow of fate crushed the
last vestiges of hope from hugh trench-
ards heait a wave of utter despair
almost swamped his reason-but with it
came that desperate courage that is born
of despair forcing his horror-frozen fea-
tures into a smile he called to the in-
visible apparition

   jake

   another shorter pause then

  who are you said the deep boom-
ing voice that hugh had heard on the
moor

  your friend i hope-never had
hugh spoken with such heartfelt convic-
tion as when he voiced that wish-but at
least i am a companion in misfortune
come nearer jake i want to talk to
you

   there was a slight hesitant pause and
then there emerged into the circle of bril-
the trail of the cloven hoof



liance cast by the shaded lamp a creature
so extraordinary and bizarre that it seemed
more like the grotesque fantasm of a
hashish-dream than an organism of actual
flesh and blood it was the upper portion
of a mans body united to the body of a
large stag

  in his secret heart hugh trenchard
had flatly disbelieved professor felgers
boast respecting the unparalleled opera-
tion by which he had kept alive the mu-
tilated body of silas maries victim but
here standing before his eyes was the liv-
ing proof and as he looked his wonder
gave place to an ungrudging admiration
of the surgical skill of the man who had
accomplished such an apparent impossi-
bility the co-ordination of movement
between the muscles of the man and beast
was perfect his actions had an easy nat-
uralness that was amazing there could
be no question of deception for the mans
body was bare and hugh could see dis-
tinctly where the human skin merged into
the reddish-brown hide of the deer ex-
cept that the animal portion was that of a
stag instead of a horse the composite
creature exactly resembled the centaurs
which are depicted in sculpture in the
famous frieze of the ancient greek par-
thenon at athens small wonder that such
a monster had gained the title of the
terror of the moor

   yet despite his terrifying aspect there
was nothing fierce in the creatures de-
meanor he came forward slowly his
chin sunk upon his massive chest an ex-
pression of sadness that was piteous in its
hopelessness delineated on his weather-
tanned features his first words seemed
to give the key to this unexpected change

  where is the pretty lady he asked in
a fretful tone who has taken her
away

  with an effort hugh suppressed the
awful train of thought which started at

the question everything depended on
keeping the terror in his present state of
quiescence

  what pretty lady he asked in as
casual a tone as he could assume

  the pretty lady who was upstairs i
found her hiding-for jake can see in the
dark you know-and she would have shot
me with a shiny pistol which she had
but i told her that i was her friend and
would not hurt so much as one of her
golden hairs and as we talked the mas-
ter came and seized her from behind and
took away her pistol he carried her
away but he told me she would soon
come back to me then i could teach her
all about the moors and the forests and
the secret paths through the bogs and
marshes show her the deep stone caves
in the hearts of the tors and the mossy
dells where die wild-flowers grow for i
am the monarch of the moors and they
have no secrets from me a transient
gleam cf his old fierceness flashed in his
eyes as he threw back his head but it van-
ished as he went on plaintively where
has the pretty lady gone to do you
know

  trenchards brain had been working
feverishly during the foregoing speech
beyond a doubt jake was referring to
joan endean and hugh could well imag-
ine with what fantastic promises the wily
professor had kept him quiet while he
effected his escape with the girl maybe
it would be possible to turn this creatures
whim to some account

  yes he nodded i think i know
who has taken her

  who demanded jake clenching his
hands and bracing his arms until the
great muscles stood out tell me who

  before i tell you you must do some-
thing for me hugh bargained

  anything-only tell me


weird tales

  hugh trenchard pointed to the danc-
ing glass globe

  catch that pretty ball-but very very
carefully-and hand it to me

  but the half-witted creature turned
away with a petulant gesture

  jake does not want to play with a ball
-he wants to find the pretty lady
trenchards heart sank it would be
hopeless to attempt to convey to that
primitive intelligence the deadly possi-
bilities of that glittering ball yet at any
moment the thing might shatter and bring
death to both mastering his chagrin he
uttered an approving laugh

  quite right-this is no time to play
the pretty lady needs our help and we
must follow her at once but-he went
on silencing the others eager exclamation
-the widced man who has stolen her
away has also chained me up so that i can
not show you where she is help me to
break this chain and i will lead you to
her

  without a single word jake advanced
to where hugh stood seizing the slack
of the chain with both hands he put forth
the strength of his mighty muscles brac-
ing his hoofed feet on the uneven floor
and throwing his immense weight on the
chain with a sudden jerk the weakened
link parted like a strand of pack-thread
hugh trenchard was free at last

it was the work of a moment to catch
the gas-diarged ball and transfer it
safely to an inner pocket then he turned
to his new-found ally

  you know professor felger

  the creature nodded eagerly yes he
is my master

  where is he

  he is going to fly away in a bird-
machine was the unhesitating answer

  an airplane hugh trenchard bit his
lip here was an unexpected complica-

tion if felger was already in the air all
hope of a successful pursuit would be
over then would joan be lost to him in-
deed hoping against hope he turned
tyith a quick question

  where does the master keep his bird-
machine in this house

  no jake shook his head it is hid-
den in a cave on cow castle but yester-
day we got it out and i helped to feed it
for its journey

  feed it it was some seconds before
the puzzled hugh grasped the meaning of
the queer expression petrol for the en-
gine-of course that was what the simple-
minded lad meant felger had been fill-
ing the tanks for a long journey he in-
tended to start from his secret hangar on
cow castle-would it be possible to reach
that spot before he took off

   cae castle to give it its correct desig-
nation the cow being merely a local
corruption was well known to hugh
trenchard-as indeed it must be to every
lover of exmoor lying about five miles
northwest of the village of withypool
near where the sheardon water joins the
river barle three drcular hills rise from
the floor of the valley the loftiest of
which is the castle in question but it
is a castle without battlements or even the
crumbling remnants of stone walls the
name is a mere tradition which has been
handed down unbroken from the prehis-
toric days when this eminence was a
stronghold of the ancient britons the
only remaining traces of its former war-
like use are the earthen rampart nowhere
more than ten feet high and the shallow
depression which marks the course of the
ancient fosse measured in a direct line
its distance from the torside sanatorium
was but a trifle under eight miles but-
and at the thought hughs heart began to
beat high with returning hope-there was
no direct road between the two places and
the trail of the cloven hoof



such roads as existed in the valley of the
barle were little better than mere tracks
strewn with rocks and in places mere
quagmires

  if he but had a good horse between his
legs he might be able to beat felger yet
a horse he looked at the clean-molded
limbs of the great man-animal which
stood by his side and in it he saw the final
answer to his problem here ready to
hand eager and willing was as swift a
mount as any man could desire mounted
on the back of the erstwhile terror of the
moor he could yet snatch victory from
the very jaws of defeat

  in a few words he explained his plan
to jake and to his joy he found him no
less eager than himself

  yes yes cried the cloven-hoofed
centaur as they ascended the stairs and
emerged into the open i know a hun-
dred paths and tracks known only to the
great herds of deer of which i am the
king mount on my back mount and
away

  the man-beast crouched on the ground
to let hugh bestride his broad back an
instant later he was on his feet and gal-
loping straight across the wild moor
pointing with unerring instinct straight to
his goal

hugh was no expert bare-backed
rider and it took him some time
before he found a secure seat on his
novel steed it was only by sitting well
forward racing-fashion and grasping the
long coarse hair of the stags withers
that he avoided being thrown for the
going was certainly rough consisting as
it did of a series of lightning-like bounds
occasionally varied with a sharp chopping
gallop the beast seemed to be in the air
far more frequently than on the ground
there would be a few minutes of fairly
steady progress over the heather then the

muscles of the mighty haunches would
bunch together for a spring and the next
moment it would be flying through the
air like an arrow in a leap that would
easily have cleared a five-barred gate

  but if the going was hard the pace was
hot breathless and not a little concerned
about the safety of his neck hugh clung
on like grim death and saw the nearer
details of the landscape streaming past
him like a badly operated cinema film
but on and on went his nightmare steed
swift as the wind and seemingly as tire-
less now the great hoofs would be
cleaving the long grass with a gentle
swishing sound now they would be rat-
tling over loose shingle or bare naked
rock now splashing through some shal-
low stream now muffled in a ghost-like
swoop over green cushions of spongy
moss once the sure-footed beast thread-
ed an apparently non-existent ledge across
the face of a dizzy crag where a single
false step would have hurled both to in-
stant death once they found their prog-
ress barred by a wide rushing river-one
of the lower readies of the barle but
the cloven-footed steed dived with a
mighty plunge which sent the water
splashing in a myriad glistening jewels
breasting the swift current with gallant
strokes until panting dripping but re-
freshed by its ice-cold bath it scrambled
up the farther bank and resumed the
breakneck pace

   disdaining to use the little rustic bridge
-which would have meant a detour of a
few hundred yards-the stag again took
water and when it emerged hugh dash-
ing the water from his eyes saw rising
from the valley of the river isolated and
forbidding the towering mass of the pre-
historic stronghold

  the terror halted and for the first
time since the beginning of that night-
mare ride spoke


weird tales

  look he said pointing

  half-way up the slope of the hill two
twin stars had appeared winding slowly
upward to the summit it needed no sec-
ond glance for hugh to recognize them
as the headlights of felgers car he was
nearing his destination while they had
still the steep slope of the mountain to
climb

  now would the muscles and sinews of
the terror of the moor be put to their
final test it would be a matter of seconds
whether they arrived just in time-or
just too late



stark grim mysterious the ancient
hill-fortress loomed before them
seemingly as impregnable as it had been
in the ages before the trumpet-blare of
the roman legions had echoed from its
rock-bound slopes and even now when
the skin-clad blue-painted wielders of
bow and spear who had manned its ram-
parts in the dim far-off past were now
moldering dust it was still a place of
considerable natural strength its broad
summit  feet in circumference
stood over two thousand feet above the
level of the sea except where the rough
road had appropriated the easiest inclines
of approach its sides were steep enough
to daunt the heart of the boldest rider

  but the terror of the moor appeared
to feel no qualms stooping over the
shelving bank of the stream he drank
deeply of the ice-cold water as though
well aware of the ordeal that lay before
him then without pause or hesitation he
set off with undiminished speed the
narrow space of level ground was covered
in a flash and they were at the foot of a
hill so vast that its bulk seemed to blot
out the stars above then the nerve-rack-
ing ascent began

  hugh trenchard keenly on the alert

tried in vain to ascertain the method by
which the stag-man guided his course a
hundred times he turned and twisted to
avoid some jutting boulder or impassable
crag but his track though necessarily
devious was ever in the same direction
and always it headed upward whether
he trusted to blind instinct or whether his
nightly roaming of the moor had made
him familiar with the approach to the
isolated hill hugh could not determine
but never once did the terror have to re-
trace his steps again and again they
reached a place whence it seemed as if no
living creature other than a bird could
proceed another foot but always the
terror managed to surmount or circum-
vent the obstacle and mount to heights
dizzier still

  at first hugh could not help wonder-
ing why jake did not take the easier
gradient which felger was following in
the car but on glancing to the right he
saw the reason they were almost on a
level with the white glare of the head-
lights jake was counting on the more
direct though more dangerous route to
bring him to the summit before the ar-
rival of the car yet it was clear that the
final spurt would be a race neck to neck
hampered as he was by hughs weight
on his back the iron endurance of the
terror was beginning to flag at last his
breath grew labored his movements slow-
er the shaggy hair to which hugh clung
was soaked in sweat

  let me get off and follow as best i
can hugh urged as he noted these signs

  the terror shook his head impatiently

  you would go to your death without
my guidance he gasped set your
weight well forward on my shoulders
hold tight and trust to me ill make it
yet

  and make it he did though by the
bare margin of a chance-gripped root
the trail of the cloven hoof



which held firm when a crumbling ledge
of rock disintegrated into a shower of cas-
cading fragments beneath their combined
weight spent and panting jake drew
himself over the brow of the cliff and lay
safe indeed but for the time being pros-
trate with sheer exhaustion and at the
same moment the headlights of felgers
car came into sight on the farther side of
the plateau and by their light hugh saw
the outlines of a small monoplane stand-
ing facing a gap in the earthen rampart
apparently in readiness for an immediate
flight

  naturally the professor anticipated
finding the plateau deserted and there
was no attempt at concealment in his ac-
tions alighting from the car he opened
the rear door and lifted out an inert
body the blood began to throb quickly
in hugh trenchards temples as he saw
that it was joan bound hand and foot
keeping in the shadows he began to
creep forward his hand caressing the
smooth surface of the deadly gas-bomb in
his pocket

  apparently felger decided that the
girls bonds had served their purpose for
he drew a knife from his pocket and
quickly severed them

  we have a long journey before us
ray dear hugh heard him say and i
shall be too busily occupied to do that
after we have once taken off from the
ground but pray do not let your free-
dom lead you into a foolish attempt to
escape you and i are the only two peo-
ple in the world who know the secret of
the detonating gas and thus you are
doubly precious in my eyes come now
will you enter that airplane of your own
accord or shall i have to tie you up
again

joan rose to her feet and faced him
her slender figure outlined blackly
against the fierce white glare of the head-

lamps hugh could see that her head was
held fearlessly and proudly erect as if
she realized the peril of her position and
was resolved to face it without flinching

  you have won so far professor lu-
cien felger she said in a voice that
never quivered you may even succeed
in forcing me to accompany you wherever
you may be bound but rest assured that
your triumph will extend no further you
will have to travel very far indeed before
you can reach a land where the extradi-
tion laws do not hold good-a much
farther distance in fact than you could
safely cover in a machine as small as the
one you have here and do you think that i
will remain silent after we have landed
if you do then you must be mad indeed i
i know you for what you are and i will
proclaim your guilt from the housetops
there are few towns in europe from
which one can not get into touch with a
british consul after i have had ten min-
utes conversation with one your career
will be ended

  professor felgers shoulders lifted in
an elaborate shrug

  that would be deplorable-would it
not-for a man with such gifts as i pos-
sess to end his career on a vulgar british
gallows like any common uneducated
crook suavely as he spoke there was a
cold rasping ring in the words but
fortunately that is not likely to happen
oh he gave a bark of laughter i have
not the slightest doubt of your perfect
readiness to denounce me as you threat-
ened but you must realize that in order
to detail my crimes to your most estima-
ble british consul you must first be able
to remember them

  a faint smile dawned on joan en-
deans features

  remember them she echoed soon-
er than i would forget them i would for-
get my own identity


weird tales

  indeed purred felger there is
many a true word spoken in jest miss
endean and even such an apparent im-
possibility as the one you have just men-
tioned may come to pass have you for-
gotten that i hold the secret of the so-
called apple of lethe-the tincture of
which steals the memory without leaving
so much as a trace behind one little in-
jection and your mind will become as
a clean sheet of paper on which i can
write as i will

  in spite of her courage the girl re-
coiled

  no no you would not dare-

  dare he repeated and hugh saw
that his countenance had taken on such a
diabolical look as he never thought a
human face was capable of you shall
see how much i will dare to ensure my-
self being the sole possessor of the secret
of maries detonating gas

  he darted forward as he spoke and
seized her wrist in an iron grip disre-
garding her struggles he brought for-
ward his left hand and hugh caught the
silvery glint of a poised hypodermic
syringe

  at the sight of the imminent peril of
the girl he loved all hugh trenchards
carefully pre-arranged plan of action
scattered like chaff before the wind like
an avenging fury he bore down on the
struggling pair his clenched fist shot out
like a battering-ram but felger heard
the quick footfalls on the rocky ground
and releasing the girl tried to dodge
had hughs blow found its intended
mark on the point of the other mans
chin the fight would have been ended
but felgers sudden movement made the
blow land on his shoulder sending him
sprawling backward on the ground

  take that you swine cried hugh
in a voice of thunder you have a man
to deal with now

  in his rage and indignation he had
quite forgotten that he was unarmed but
it was not long before he was reminded
of it twisting like an eel felger
wrenched an automatic from his pocket
and promptly covered him

  stick em up curse you he rasped
rising to his feet without shifting his
aim so youve managed to dodge the
globe of gas eh well ive a few words
to say to you before i dispatch you in a
manner which will not fail up with
em

hughs hands were already in the air
and felgers lips drew back in a
tigerish grin as he saw the promptness of
the movement but the next moment the
grin vanished to give place to a stare of
gaping fear poised in hughs right hand
was the deadly glass ball which contained
the detonating gas

  i strongly advise you not to fire pro-
fessor warned the young man quietly
if you do there will be more victims
than one probably you recognize the
glass ball which i hold in my hand in
that case it is needless for me to explain
to you what will happen if i let it drop
on the rock at my feet and you may
rest assured that i shall drop it the mo-
ment you fire

  and doom the girl you love to cer-
tain death sneered the professor

  a clean and certain death is prefer-
able a thousand times to the living death
which you intended to inflict on her
hugh answered sternly

  yes yes joan cried eagerly and
if my death will save the soldiers of my
country from being exposed to the gas
that would turn them into living bombs
i shall at least not have died in vain
a long pause of silence followed her
words baffled by this unexpected turn
felger stood bking his thin lips his eyes
the trail of the cloven hoof





alternately searching the faces of the man
and the girl but in neither could he read
the slightest sign of fear or irresolution
his crafty brain was not slow in recog-
nizing the fact that he had failed when
success was almost within his grasp
slowly reluctantly he lowered the muz-
zle of his weapon

   stalemate he said with the air of a
veteran gambler who sees his stake
raked in

  hugh trenchard shook his head
grimly

  checkmate-as far as youre con-
cerned he corrected

   i think not said felger coolly life
is too precious for heroics better call it a
drawn game you take your girl and
ill take the secret of the gas and well
call it quits

   agreed cried hugh and so unex-
pected was his ready acceptance that joan
looked at him in surprize

  but hugh- she began to re-
monstrate but he silenced her with a
gesture

   wait leave everything to me

   apparently felge was only too glad
to agree to the truce without a word
he moved to the airplane and clambered
into the pilots cockpit there he rapidly
took from a locker a leather flying-helmet
and a pair of goggles hugh watching
him closely the while

   professor felger settled himself in his
seat and depressed the starting-lever and
immediately the twin blades of the pro-
peller began to xevolve its low hum-
ming grew to a dull roar as the revolu-
tions increased the plane began to move
in its preliminary run along the ground
before taking off and it was not until
then that the thing happened for which
hugh trenchard had been waiting

   half turning in his seat as the plane

ran past the spot where hugh and joan
were standing their figures starkly out-
lined against the headlamps of the car
felger levelled his automatic and emptied
its contents at the pair in one long
treacherous fusillade

  but hugh was prepared not for one
instant had he thought that the outwitted
spy would accept defeat without one last
bid for victory and this was precisely the
form that hugh had anticipated his
vengeance would take it had not been
by chance that hugh had taken his stand
in front of the car where his figure
showing sharp and clear against the glare
of the headlights offered a tempting tar-
get now at felgers first suspicious
movement with his pistol-hand he
caught joan in his arms and leapt aside
allowing the dazzling white beams to
shine full in the eyes of the perfidious
villain who had thus broken his word

  dazed half blinded by the sudden
glare felger fired at random one shot
splintering the lens of a headlight the
rest droning harmlessly away into the
darkness

  as the first report rang out hugh
raised his hand and threw the gas-charged
globe into the rear cockpit of the moving
plane he saw it drop out of sight be-
hind the fuselage but owing to the noise
of the engines he could not tell whether
his death-dealing missile had fallen in-
tact on the cushioned seat or shattered
against the woodwork

   felger all unconscious of his sinister
cargo clicked over a lever and the air-
plane began to move with increasing
speed toward the edge of the plateau it
was barely half-way across when joan
suddenly gripped the arm of the man by
her side

   look she gasped white and tremb-
ling the terror of the moor


weird tales

it was indeed the half-human monster
huge silent menacing in his very
bulk he stood full in the path of the on-
rushing plane his four feet firmly
planted on the ground his dual bodies
braced as though to withstand the coming
shock calm and inexorable as some mis-
shapen nemesis the light of implacable
hatred shining in his luminous eyes he
must have appeared to the terror-stricken
felger like some phantom of retributive
justice a frankenstein monster about to
wreak his long-delayed vengeance on the
man who had brought him into existence

  nearer and nearer came the whirling
propeller until it seemed as if the next
second would see the centaur stag scat-
tered to the winds in shreds of mangled
flesh then it was that the terror gath-
ered his mighty muscles and leapt

  like a speeding arrow he rose from the
ground not sideways not backward but
forward straight over the zooming
blades he landed somewhere on the
body of the plane the two watchers had
a fleeting glimpse of a confused mass of
lashing hoofs and struggling human
limbs then the inclined pinions of the
plane swooped it upward and like an
uncaged bird the machine rose and
headed for the distant silver streak of the
sea

  with set expectant faces hugh and
joan waited and watched quickly the
roar of the engine dwindled to a musical
hum the dark shadow of the plane itself
merged into the sable veil of the night

  it must have passed the coastline by
now said hugh voicing his thoughts
aloud that means-

  even as he spoke a trail of glowing
crimson leaped from the cloudless sky
and after what seemed an interminable
interval a dull rending boom floated to
their ears as amid a tangled and twisted
mass of wreckage the terror of the moor
and the man whose misapplied genius
had brought it into being together
flashed into flaming death

  not until the last hissing fragment had
plunged into the distant sea did hugh
trenchard break the silence

  god grant that so may perish every
device that tends to foster mans in-
humanity against man he said gravely

  amen murmured the girl by his
side a greater power than our puny
efforts has decreed that the secret of the
dread gas shall remain to me alone but
i have no intention of parting with my
knowledge for war is terrible enough
without such a fiendish method of
slaughter if a day of conflict between
rival nations must dawn again then let
clean fighting and the fortitude inspired
by a righteous cause be the arbiters
which confer victory or defeat as far as
i am concerned the secret of maries
formula shall remain a mystery for all
time

  clinging closely to him she raised her
face to his and in her radiant eyes hugh
trenchard read the answer to the most
entrancing mystery of all

           ark eidolon

by clark ashton smith

 a powerful vivid and eery tale of the tremendous doom that was
 loosed upon the kingdom of xylac by a
 vengeful sorcerer

thasaidon lord of seven hells
wherein the single serpent dwells

with volumes drawn from pit to pit
through fire and darkness infinite-
thasaidon sun of nether skies

thine ancient evil never dies

for aye thy somber fulgors flame
on sunken worlds that have no name
mans heart enthrones thee still supreme
though the false sorcerers blaspheme

-the song of xeetbra

on zothique the last continent
of earth the sun no longer shone
with the whiteness of its prime
but was dim and tarnished as if with a
vapor of blood new stars without num-
ber had declared themselves in the heav-
ens and the shadows of the infinite had
fallen closer and out of the shadows
the older gods had returned to man the

                                        


weird tales

gods forgotten since hyperborea since
mu and poseidonis bearing other names
but the same attributes and the elder
demons had also returned battening
on the fumes of evil sacrifice and foster-
ing again the primordial sorceries

  many were the necromancers and ma-
gicians of zothique and the infamy and
marvel of their doings were legended
everywhere in the latter days but among
them all there was none greater than
namirrha who imposed his black yoke
on the cities of xylac and later in a
proud delirium deemed himself the veri-
table peer of thasaidon lord of evil

  namirrha had built his abode in um-
maos the chief town of xylac to which
he came from the desert realm of tasuun
with the dark renown of his thauma-
turgies like a cloud of desert storm be-
hind him and no man knew that in com-
ing to ummaos he returned to the city of
his birth for all deemed him a native of
tasuun indeed none could have dreamt
that the great sorcerer was one with the
beggar-boy narthos an orphan of ques-
tionable parentage who had begged his
daily bread in the streets and bazars of
ummaos wretchedly had he lived alone
and despised and a hatred of the cruel
opulent city grew in his hear like a
smothered flame that feeds in secret bid-
ing the time when it shall become a con-
flagration consuming all things

  bitterer always through his boyhood
and early youth was the spleen and ran-
cor of narthos toward men and one
day the prince zotulla a boy but little
older than he riding a restive palfrey
came upon him in the square before the
imperial palace and narthos implored
an alms but zotulla scorning his plea
rode arrogantly forward spurring the
palfrey and narthos was ridden down
and trampled under its hooves and
afterward nigh to death from the tramp-

ling he lay senseless for many hours
while the people passed him by unheed-
ing and at last regaining his senses he
dragged himself to his hovel but he
limped a little thereafter all his days and
the mark of one hoof remained like a
brand on his body fading never later
he left ummaos and was forgotten
quickly by its people going southward
into tasuun he lost his way in the great
desert and was near to perishing but
finally he came to a small oasis where
dwelt the wizard ouphaloc a hermit who
preferred the company of honest jackals
and hyenas to that of men and ouph-
aloc seeing the great craft and evil in the
starveling boy gave succor to narthos
and sheltered him he dwelt for years
with ouphaloc becoming the wizards
pupil and the heir of his demon-wrested
lore strange things he learned in that
hermitage being fed on fruits and grain
that had sprung not from the watered
earth and wine that was not the juice of
terrene grapes and like ouphaloc he
became a master in devildom and drove
his own bond with the archfiend thasai-
don when ouphaloc died he took the
name of namirrha and went forth as a
mighty sorcerer among the wandering
peoples and the deep-buried mummies of
tasuun but never could he forget the
miseries of his boyhood in ummaos and
the wrong he had endured from zotulla
and year by year he spun over in his
thoughts the black web of revenge and
his fame grew ever darker and vaster and
men feared him in remote lands beyond
tasuun with bated whispers they spoke
of his deeds in the cities of yoros and
in zul-bha-sair the abode of the ghoul-
ish deity mordiggian and long before
the coming of namirrha himself the
people of ummaos knew him as a fabled
scourge that was direr than simoom or
pestilence
the dark eidolon



  now in the years that followed the
going-forth of the boy narthos from um-
maos pithaim the father of prince zo-
tulla was slain by the sting of a small
adder that had crept into his bed for
warmth on an autumn night some said
that the adder had been purveyed by zo-
tulla but this was a thing that no man
could verily affirm after the death of
pithaim zotulla being his only son was
emperor of xylac and ruled evilly from
his throne in ummaos indolent he was
and tyrannic and full of strange luxuries
and cruelties but the people who were
also evil acclaimed him in his turpitude
so he prospered and the lords of hell and
heaven smote him not and the red suns
and ashen moons went westward over
xylac falling into that seldom-voyaged
sea which if the mariners tales were
true poured evermore like a swiftening
river past the infamous isle of naat and
fell in a worldwide cataract upon nether
space from the far sheer edge of earth

  grosser still he grew and his sins were
as overswollen fruits that ripen above a
deep abyss but the winds of time blew
softly and the fruits fell not and zo-
tulla laughed amid his fools and his
eunuchs and his lemans and the tale of
his luxuries was borne afar and was told
by dim outland peoples as a twin marvel
with the bruited necromancies of na-
mirrha

it came to pass in the year of the
hyena and the month of the star cani-
cule that a great feast was given by zo-
tulla to the inhabitants of ummaos
meats that had been cooked in exotic
spices from sotar isle of the east were
spread everywhere and the ardent wines
of yoros and xylac filled as with sub-
terranean fires were poured inexhaust-
ibly from huge urns for all the wines
awoke a furious mirth and a royal mad-

ness and afterward they brought a slum-
ber no less profound than the lethe of
the tomb and one by one as they drank
the revellers fell down in the streets the
houses and gardens as if a plague had
struck them and zotulla slept in his ban-
quet-hall of gold and ebony with his
odalisques and chamberlains about him
so in all ummaos there was no man or
woman wakeful at the hour when sirius
began to fall toward the west

  thus it was that none saw or heard the
coming of namirrha but awakening
heavily in the latter forenoon the em-
peror zotulla heard a confused babble a
troublous clamor of voices from such of
his eunuchs and women as had awakened
before him inquiring the cause he was
told that a strange prodigy had occurred
during the night but being still bemused
with wine and slumber he comprehend-
ed little enough of its nature till his
favorite concubine obexah led him to
the eastern portico of the palace from
which he could behold the marvel with
his own eyes

  now the palace stood alone at the cen-
ter of ummaos and to north west and
south for wide intervals of distance there
stretched the imperial gardens full of
superbly arching palms and loftily spir-
ing fountains but to eastward was a
broad open area used as a sort of com-
mon between the palace and the man-
sions of high optimates and in this
space which had lain wholly vacant at
eve a building towered colossal and lord-
ly beneath the full-risen sun with domes
like monstrous fungi of stone that had
come up in the night and the domes
rearing level with those of zotulla were
builded of death-white marble and the
huge facade with multi-columned por-
ticoes and deep balconies was wrought in
alternate zones of night-black onyx and
porphyry hued as with dragons-blood


weird tales

and zotulla swore lewdly calling with
hoarse blasphemies on the gods and devils
of xylac and great was his dumfound-
ment deeming the marvel a work of wiz-
ardry the vomen gathered about him
crying out with shrill cries of awe and
terror and more and more of his cour-
tiers awakening came to swell the hub-
bub and the fat castradoes diddered in
their cloth-of-goid like immense black
jellies in golden basins but zotulla
mindful of his dominion as emperor of
all xylac sought to conceal his own
trepidation saying

  now who is this that has presumed to
enter ummaos like a jackal in the dark
and has made his impious den in prox-
imity and counterview with my palace
go forth and inquire the miscreants
name but ere you go instruct the im-
perial headsman to make sharp his double-
handed sword

  then fearing the emperors wrath if
they tarried certain of the chamberlains
went forth unwillingly and approached
the portals of the strange edifice it
seemed that the portals were deserted till
they drew near and then on the thresh-
old there appeared a titanic skeleton tall-
er than any man of earth and it strode
forward to meet them with ell-long
strides the skeleton was swathed in a
loin-cloth of scarlet silk with a buckle of
jet and it wore a black turban starred
with diamonds whose topmost foldings
nearly touched the lofty lintel eyes like
flickering marsh-fires burned in its deep
eye-sockets and a blackened tongue like
that of a long-dead man protruded be-
tween its teeth but otherwise it was clean
of flesh and the bones glittered whitely
in the sun as it came onward

  the chamberlains were mute before it
and there was no sound except the golden
creaking of their girdles the shrill
rustling of their silks as they shook and

trembled and the foot-bones of the
skeleton clicked sharply on the pavement
of blade onyx as it paused and the putre-
fying tongue began to quiver between its
teeth and it uttered these words in an
unctuous nauseous voice

  return and tell the emperor zotulla
that namirrha seer and magidan has
come to dwell beside him

  hearing the skeleton speak as if it had
been a living man and hearing the dread
name of namirrha as men hear the tocsin
of doom in some fallen city the chamber-
lains could stand before it no longer and
they fled with ungainly swiftness and
bore the message to zotulla

  now learning who it was that had
come to neighbor with him in ummaos
the emperors wrath died out like a feeble
and blustering flame on which the wind
of darkness has blown and the vinous
purple of his cheeks was mottled with a
strange pallor and he said nothing but
his lips mumbled loosely as if in prayer
or malediction and the news of na-
mirrhas coming passed like the flight of
evil night-birds through all the palace
and throughout the city leaving a noisome
terror that abode in ummaos thereafter
till the end for namirrha through the
black renown of his thaumaturgies and
the frightful entities who served him had
become a power that no secular sovereign
dared dispute and men feared him every-
where even as they feared the gigantic
shadowy lords of hell and of outer space
and in ummaos people said that he had
come on the desert wind from tasuun
with his underlings even a the pestilence
comes and had reared his house in an
hour with the aid of devils beside zo-
tullas palace and they said that the
foundations of the house were laid on
the adamantine cope of hell and in its
floors were pits at whose bottom burned
the nether fires or stars could be seen as

                     w t-
the dark eidolon



they passed under in lowermost night
and the followers of namirrha were the
dead of strange kingdoms the demons of
sky and earth and the abyss and mad
impious hybrid things that the sorcerer
himself had created from forbidden
unions

  men shunned the neighborhood of his
lordly house and in the palace of zo-
tulla few cared to approach the windows
and balconies that gave thereon and the
emperor himself spoke not of namirrha
pretending to ignore the intruder and
the women of the harem babbled ever-
more with an evil gossip concerning na-
mirrha and his concubines but the sor-
cerer himself was not beheld by the peo-
ple of the city though seme believed that
he walked forth at will clad with in-
visibility his servitors likewise were not
seen but a howling as of the damned
was sometimes heard to issue from his
portals and sometimes there came a stony
cachinnation as if some adamantine
image had laughed aloud and sometimes
there was a chuckling like the sound of
shattered ice in a frozen hell dim
shadows moved in the porticoes when
there was neither sunlight nor lamp to
cast them and red eery lights appeared
and vanished in the windows at eve like
a blinking of demoniac eyes and slowly
the ember-colored suns went over xylac
and were quenched in far seas and the
ashy moons were blackened as they fell
nightly toward the hidden gulf then
seeing that the wizard had wrought no
open evil and that none had endured
palpable harm from his presence the peo-
ple took heart and zotulla drank deeply
and feasted in oblivious luxury as before
and dark thasaidon prince of all turpi-
tudes was the true but never-acknowl-
edged lord of xylac and in time the
men of ummaos bragged a little of na-
mirrha and his dread thaumaturgies even
w t-

  as they had boasted of the purple sins of
zotulla

  but namirrha still unbeheld by living
men and living women sat in the inner
halls of that house which his devils had
reared for him and spun over and over
in his thoughts the black web of revenge
and in all ummaos there was none
even among his fellow-beggars who re-
called the beggar-boy narthos and the
wrong done by zotulla to narthos in old
time was the least of those cruelties which
the emperor had forgotten

now when the fears of zotulla were
somewhat lulled and his women
gossiped less often of the neighboring
wizard there occurred a new wonder and
a fresh terror for sitting one eve at his
banquet-table with his courtiers about
him the emperor heard a noise as of
myriad iron-shod hooves that came tramp-
ling through the palace-gardens and the
courtiers also heard the sound and were
startled amid their mounting drunken-
ness and the emperor was angered and
he sent certain of his guards to examine
into the cause of the trampling but peer-
ing forth upon the moon-bright lawns
and parterres the guards beheld no visi-
ble shape though the loud sounds of
trampling still went to and fro it seemed
as if a rout of wild stallions passed and
re-passed before the facade of the palace
with tumultuous gallopings and capri-
coles and a fear came upon the guards as
they looked and listened and they dared
not venture forth but returned to zotulla
and the emperor himself grew sober
when he heard their tale and he went
forth with high blusterings to view the
prodigy and all night the unseen hooves
rang out sonorously on the pavements of
onyx and ran with deep thuddings over
the grasses and flowers the palm-fronds
waved on the windless air as if parted by

were trodden under and rage and ter-
ror nested together in zotullas heart as
he stood in a balcony above the garden
hearing the spectral tumult and behold-
ing the harm done to his rarest flower-
beds the women the courtiers and
eunuchs cowered behind him and there
was no slumber for any occupant of the
palace but toward dawn the clamor of
hooves departed going toward na-
mirrhas house

  when the dawn was full-grown above
ummaos the emperor walked forth with
his guards about him and saw that the
crushed grasses and broken-down stems
were blackened as if by fire where the
hooves had fallen plainly were the
marks imprinted like the tracks of a
great company of horses in all the lawns
and parterres but they ceased at the verge
of the gardens and though every one
believed that the visitation had come
from namirrha there was no proof of
this in the grounds that fronted the sor-
cerers abode for here the turf was un-
trodden

  a pox upon namirrha if he has
done this cried zctulla for what
harm have i ever done to him verily i
shall set my heel on the dogs neck and
the torture-wheel shall serve him even as
these horses from hell have served my
blood-red lilies of sotar and my vein-
colored irises of naat and my orchids
from uccastrog which were purple as the
bruises of love yea though he stand
the viceroy of thasaidon above earth
and overlord of ten thousand devils my
wheel shall break him and fires shall
heat the wheel white-hot in its turning
till he withers black as the seared blos-
soms thus did zotulla make his brag
but he isstied no orders for the execution
of the threat and no man stirred from

  the palace toward namirrhas house and
from the portals of the wizard none came
forth or if any came there was no visible
sign or sound

  so the day went over and the night
rose bringing later a moon that was
slightly darkened at the rim and the
night was silent and zotulla sitting long
at the banquet-table drained his wine-cup
often and wrathfully muttering new
threats against namirrha and the night
wore on and it seemed that the visita-
tion would not be repeated but at mid-
night lying in his chamber with obexah
and fathom-deep in slumber from his
wine zotulla was awakened by a mon-
strous clangor of hooves that raced and
capered in the palace porticoes and in the
long balconies all night the hooves
thundered back and forth echoing awful-
ly in the vaulted stone while zotulla and
obexah listening huddled close amid
their cushions and coverlets and all the
occupants of the palace wakeful and
fearful heard the noise but stirred not
from their chambers a little before
dawn the hooves departed suddenly and
afterward by day their marks were found
on the marble flags of the porches and
balconies and the marks were countless
deep-graven and black as if branded
there by flame

  like mottled marble were the emper-
ors cheeks when he saw the hoof-printed
floors and terror stayed with him hence-
forward following him to the depths of
his inebriety since he knew not where
the haunting would cease his women
murmured and some wished to flee from
ummaos and it seemed that the revels
of the day and the evening were shad-
owed by ill wings that left their umbrage
in the yellow wine and bedimmed the
aureate lamps and again toward mid-
night the slumber of zotulla was broken
by the hooves which came galloping and
the dark eidolon



pacing on the palace-roof and through
all the corridors and halls thereafter
till dawn the hooves filled the palace
with their iron clatterings and they rang
hollowly on the topmost domes as if the
coursers of gods had trodden there pass-
ing from heaven to heaven in tumultuous
cavalcade

  zotulla and obexah lying together
while the terrible hooves went to and fro
in the hall outside their chamber had no
heart or thought for sin nor could they
find any comfort in their nearness in the
gray hour before dawn they heard a great
thundering high on the barred brazen
door of the room as if some mighty
stallion rearing had drummed there with
his forefeet and soon after this the
hooves went away leaving a silence like
an interlude in some gathering storm of
doom later the marks of the hooves were
found everywhere in the halls marring
the bright mosaics black holes were
burnt in the golden-threaded rugs and the
rugs of silver and scarlet and the high
white domes were pitted pox-wise with
the marks and far up on the brazen door
of zotullas chamber the prints of a
horses forefeet were incised deeply

now in ummaos and throughout
xylac the tale of this haunting
became known and the thing was deemed
an ominous prodigy though people dif-
fered in their interpretations some held
that the sending came from namirrha
and was meant as a token of his suprem-
acy above all kings and emperors and
some thought that it came from a new
wizard who had risen in tinarath far to
the east and who wished to supplant
namirrha and the priests of the gods
of xylac held that their various deities
had dispatched the haunting as a sign
that more sacrifices were required in the
temples

  then in his hall of audience whose
floor of sard and jasper had been griev-
ously pocked by the unseen hooves zo-
tulla called together many priests and
magicians and soothsayers and asked
them to declare the cause of the sending
and devise a mode of exorcism but
seeing that there was no agreement among
them zotulla provided the several priest-
ly sects with the wherewithal of sacrifice
to their sundry gods and sent them
away and the wizards and prophets
under threat of decapitation if they re-
fused were enjoined to visit namirrha in
his mansion of sorcery and learn his will
if haply the sending were his and not the
work of another

  loth were the wizards and the sooth-
sayers fearing namirrha and caring not
to intrude upon the frightful mysteries of
his obscure mansion but the swordsmen
of the emperor drave them forth lifting
great crescent blades against them when
they tarried so one by one in a strag-
gling order the delegation went toward
namirrhas portals and vanished into the
devil-builded house

  pale muttering and distraught like
men who have looked upon hell and have
seen their doom they returned before
sunset to the emperor and they said
that namirrha had received them cour-
teously and had sent them back with this
message

  be it known to zotulla that the haunt-
ing is a sign of that which he has long
forgotten and the reason of the haunting
will be revealed to him at the hour pre-
pared and set apart by destiny and the
hour draws near for namirrha bids the
emperor and all his court to a great feast
on the afternoon of the morrow

  having delivered this message to the
wonder and consternation of zotulla the
delegation begged his leave to depart
and though the emperor questioned them


weird tales

minutely they seemed unwilling to relate
the circumstances of their visit to na-
mirrha nor would they describe the sor-
cerers fabled house except in a vague
manner each contradicting the other as
to what he had seen so after a little
zotulla bade them go and when they had
gone he sat musing for a long while on
the invitation of namirrha which was a
thing that he cared not to accept but
feared to decline that evening he drank
even more liberally than was his wont
and he slept a lethean slumber nor was
there any noise of trampling hooves about
the palace to awaken him and silently
during the night the prophets and the
magicians passed like furtive shadows
from ummaos and no man saw them de-
part and at morning they were gone
from xylac into other lands never to re-
turn   

now on that same evening in the
giat hall of his house namirrha
sat alone having dismissed the mummies
the monsters the skeletons and familiars
who attended him ordinarily before
him on an altar of jet was the dark
gigantic statue of thasaidon which a
devil-begotten sculptor had wrought in
ancient days for an evil king of tasuun
called pharnoc the archdemon was de-
picted in the guise of a full-armored war-
rior lifting a spiky mace as if in heroic
battle long had the statue lain in the
desert-sunken palace of pharnoc whose
very site was disputed by the nomads
and namirrha by his divination had
found it and had reared up the infernal
image to abide with him always there-
after and often through the mouth of
the statue thasaidon would utter oracles
to namirrha or would answer interro-
gations

before the black-armored image there
hung seven silver lamps wrought in the

form of horses skulls with flames issuing
changeably in blue and purple and crim-
son from their eye-sockets wild and
lurid was their light and the face of the
demon peering from under his crested
helmet was filled with malign equivocal
shadows that shifted and changed eternal-
ly and sitting in his serpent-carven
chair namirrha regarded the statue grim-
ly with a deep-furrowed frown between
his eyes for he had asked a certain thing
of thasaidon and the fiend replying
through the statue had refused him and
rebellion was in the heart of namirrha
grown mad with pride and deeming him-
self the lord of all sorcerers and a ruler
by his own right among the princes of
devildom so after long pondering he
repeated his request in a bold and haughty
voice like one who addresses an equal
rather than the all-formidable suzerain to
whom he has sworn a fatal fealty

  i have helped you heretofore in all
things said the image with stony and
sonorous accents that were echoed metal-
lically in the seven silver lamps yea
the undying worms of fire and darkness
have come forth like an army at your
summons and the wings of nether genii
have risen to occlude the sun when you
called them but verily i will not aid
you in this vengeance you have planned
for the emperor zotulla has done me no
wrong and has served me well though
unwittingly and the people of xylac by
reason of their turpitudes are not the
least of my terrestrial worshippers there-
fore namirrha it were well for you to
live in peace with zotulla and well to
forget this olden wrong that was done to
the beggar-boy narthos for the ways of
destiny are strange and the workings of
its laws are sometimes hidden and truly
if the hooves of zotullas palfrey had not
spurned you and trodden you under your
life had been otherwise and the name
the dark eidolon



and renown of namirrha had still slept
in oblivion as a dream undreamed yea
you would tarry still as a beggar in
ummaos content with a beggars guer-
don and would never have fared forth to
become the pupil of the wise and learned
ouphaloc and i thasaidon would have
lost the lordliest of all necromancers who
have accepted my service and my bond
think well namirrha and ponder these
matters for both of us it would seem are
indebted to zotulla in all gratitude for
the trampling that he gave you

  yea there is a debt namirrha
growled implacably and truly i will
pay the debt tomorrow even as i have
planned    there are those who will
aid me those who will answer my sum-
moning in your despite

   it is an ill thing to affront me said
the image after an interval and also
it is not well to call upon those that you
designate however i perceive clearly
that such is your intent you are proud
and stubborn and revengeful do then
as you will but blame me not for the out-
come

  so after this there was silence in the
hall where namirrha sate before the eido-
lon and the flames burned darkly with
changeable colors in the skull-shapen
lamps and the shadows fled and returned
unresting on the face of the statue and
the face of namirrha then toward mid-
night the necromancer rose and went up-
ward by many spiral stairs to a high dome
of his house in which was a single small
round window that looked forth on the
constellations the window was set in
the top of the dome but namirrha had
contrived by means of his magic that
one entering by the last spiral of the
stairs would suddenly seem to descend
rather than climb and reaching the final
step would peer doivnward through the
window while stars passed under him in

a giddying gulf there kneeling na-
mirrha touched a secret spring in the
marble and the circular pane slid back
without sound then lying prone on the
curved interior of the dome with his face
over the abyss and his long beard trail-
ing stiffly into space he whispered a pre-
human rune and held speech with certain
entities who belonged neither to hell nor
the mundane elements and were more
fearsome to invoke than the infernal genii
or the devils of earth air water and
flame with them he made his compact
defying thasaidons will while the air
curled about him with their voices and
rime gathered palely on his sable beard
from the cold that was wrought by their
breathing as they leaned earthward

laggard and loth was the awakening of
j zotulla from his wine and quickly
ere he opened his eyes the daylight was
poisoned for him by the thought of that
invitation which he feared to accept or de-
cline but he spoke to obexah saying
who after all is this wizardly dog
that i should obey his summons like a
beggar called in from the street by some
haughty lord

   obexah a golden-skinned and oblique-
eyed girl from uccastrog isle of the tor-
turers eyed the emperor subtly and said
o zotulla it is yours to accept or re-
fuse as you deem fitting and truly it is
a small matter for the lord of ummaos
and all xylac whether to go or stay since
naught can impugn your sovereignty
therefore were it not as well to go
for obexah though fearful of the wiz-
ard was curious regarding that devil-
builded house of which so little was
known and likewise in the manner of
women she wished to behold the famed
namirrha whose mien and appearance
were still but a far-brought legend in
ummaos


weird tales

  there is something in what you say
admitted zotulla but an emperor in
his conduct must always consider the
public good and there are matters of state
involved which a woman can scarcely be
expected to understand

  so later in the forenoon after an
ample and well-irrigated breakfast he
called his chamberlains and courtiers
about him and took counsel with them
and some advised him to ignore the in-
vitation of namirrha and others held
that the invitation should be accepted lest
a graver evil than the trampling of ghost-
ly hooves should be sent upon the palace
and the city

  then zotulla called the many priest-
hoods before him in a body and sought
to resummon those wizards and soothsay-
ers who had fled privily in the night
among all the latter there was none who
answered the crying of his name through
ummaos and this aroused a certain won-
der but the priests came in greater num-
ber than before and thronged the hall of
audience so that the paunches of the fore-
most were straitened against the imperial
dais and the buttocks of the hindmost
were flattened on the rear walls and pil-
lars and zotulla debated with them the
matter of acceptance or refusal and the
priests argued as before that namirrha
was nowise concerned with the sending
and his invitation they said portended
no harm nor bale to the emperor and it
was plain from the terms of the message
that an oracle would be imparted to zo-
tulla by the wizard and this oracle if
namirrha were a true archimage would
confirm their own holy wisdom and re-
establish the divine source of the sending
and the gods of xylac would again be
glorified

  then having heard the pronounce-
ment of the priests the emperor in-
structed his treasurers to load them down

with new offerings and calling unctu-
ously upon zotulla and all his household
the vicarious blessings of their several
gods the priests departed and the day
wore on and the sun passed its meridian
falling slowly beyond ummaos through
the spaces of afternoon that were floored
with sea-ending deserts and still zotulla
was irresolute and he called his wine-
bearers bidding them pour for him the
strongest and most magistral of their vin-
tages but in the wine he found neither
certitude nor decision

  sitting still on his throne in the hall
of audience he heard toward middle
afternoon a mighty and clamorous outcry
that arose at the palace-portals there
were deep wailings of men and the shrill-
ings of eunuchs and women as if terror
passed from tongue to tongue invading
the halls and apartments and the fear-
ful clamor spread throughout all the
palace and zotulla rousing from the
lethargy of wine was about to send his
attendants to inquire the cause

   then into the hall there filed an array
of tall mummies clad in royal cerements
of purple and scarlet and wearing gold
crowns on their withered craniums and
after them like servitors came gigantic
skeletons who wore loin-cloths of nacarat
orange and about whose upper skulls
from brow to crown live serpents of
banded saffron and ebon had wrapped
themselves for head-dresses and the
mummies bowed before zotulla saying
with thin sere voices

  we who were kings of the wide
realm of tasuun aforetime have been
sent as a guard of honor for the emperor
zotulla to attend him as is befitting when
he goes forth to the feast prepared by
namirrha

   then with dry clickings of their teeth
and whistlings as of air through screens
of fretted ivory the skeletons spoke
the dark eidolon



  we who were giant warriors of a
race forgotten have also been sent by
namirrha so that the emperors house-
hold following him to the feast should
be guarded from all peril and should fare
forth in such pageantry as is meet and
proper

  witnessing these prodigies the wine-
bearers and other attendants cowered
about the imperial dais or hid behind the
pillars while zotulla with pupils swim-
ming starkly in a bloodshot white with
face bloated and ghastly pale sat frozen
on his throne and could utter no word in
reply to the ministers of namirrha

  then coming forward the mummies
said in dusty accents all is made ready
and the feast awaits the arrival of zo-
tulla and the cerements of the mum-
mies stitred and fell open at the bosom
and small rodent monsters brown as
bitumen eyed as with accursed rubies
reared forth from the eaten hearts of the
mammies like rats from their holes and
chittered shrilly in human speech repeat-
ing the words the skeletons in turn took
up the solemn sentence and the black
and saffron serpents hissed it from their
skulls and the words were repeated lastly
in baleful rumblings by certain furry crea-
tures of dubious form hitherto unseen by
zotulla who sat behind the ribs of the
skeletons as if in cages of white wicker

iike a dreamer who obeys the doom of
j dreams the emperor rose from his
throne and went forward and the mum-
mies surrounded him like an escort and
each of the skeletons drew from the red-
dish-yellow folds of his loin-cloth a curi-
ously pierced archaic flute of silver and
all began a sweet and evil and deathly
fluting as the emperor went out tlirough
the halls of the palace a fatal spell was
in the music for the chamberlains the
women the guards the eunuchs and all

members of zotullas household even to
the cooks and scullions were drawn like
a procession of night-walkers from the
rooms and alcoves in which they had
vainly hidden themselves and mar-
shaled by the flutists they followed after
zotulla a strange thing it was to behold
this mighty company of people going
forth in the slanted sunlight toward
namirrhas house witii a cortege of dead
kings about them and the blown breath
of skeletons thrilling eldritchly in the sil-
ver flutes and little was zotulla com-
forted when he found the girl obexah at
his side moving as he in a thralldom of
involitient horror with the rest of his
women close behind

  coming to the open portals of namir-
rhas house the emperor saw that they
were guarded by great crimson-wattled
tilings half dragon half man who
bowed before him sweeping their wattles
like bloody besoms on the flags of dark
onyx and the emperor passed with
obexah between the louting monsters
with the mummies the skeletons and his
own people behind him in strange
pageant and entered a vast and multi-
columned hall where the daylight fol-
lowing timidly was drowned by the bale-
ful arrogant blaze of a thousand lamps

  even amid his horror zotulla mar-
velled at the vastness of the chamber
which he could hardly reconcile with the
mansions outer length and height and
breadth though these indeed were of
most palatial amplitude for it seemed
that he gazed down great avenues of top-
less pillars and vistas of tables laden with
piled-up viands and thronged urns of
wine that stretched away before him into
luminous distance and gloom as of star-
less night

   in the wide intervals between the ta-
bles the familiars of namirrha and his
other servants went to and fro incessantly


weird tales

as if a fantasmagoria of ill dreams were
embodied before the emperor kingly
cadavers in robes of time-rotten brocade
with worms seething in their eye-pits
poured a blood-like wine into cups of the
opalescent horn of unicorns lamias
trident-tailed and four-breasted chimeras
came in with fuming platters lifted
high by their brazen claws dog-headed
devils tongued with lolling flames ran
forward to offer themselves as ushers for
the company and before zotulla and
obexah there appeared a curious being
with the full-fleshed lower limbs and hips
of a great black woman and the clean-
picked bones of some titanic ape from
there-upward and this monster signified
by certain indescribable becks of its
finger-bones that the emperor and his
favorite odalisque were to follow it

  verily it seemed to zotulla that they
had gone a long way into some malignly
litten cavern of hell when they came to
the end of that perspective of tables and
columns down which the monster had led
them here at the rooms end apart
from the rest was a table at which na-
mirrha sat alone with the flames of the
seven horse-skull lamps burning restlessly
behind him and the mailed black image
of thasaidon towering from the altar of
jet at his right hand and a little aside
from the altar a diamond mirror was up-
borne by the claws of iron basilisks

namirrha rose to greet them ob-
serving a solemn and funereal
courtesy his eyes were bleak and cold as
distant stars in the hollows wrought by
strange fearful vigils his lips were like
a pale-red seal on a shut parchment of
doom his beard flowed stiffly in black-
anointed banded locks across the bosom
of his vermilion robe like a mass of
straight black serpents zotulla felt the
blood pause and thicken about his heart

as if congealing into ice and obexah
peering beneath lowered lids was
abashed and frightened by the visible
horror that invested this man and hung
upon him even as royalty upon a king
but amid her fear she found room to
wonder what manner of man he was in
his intercourse with women

  i bid you welcome o zotulla to such
hospitality as is mine to offer said na-
mirrha with the iron ringing of some
hidden mortuary bell deep down in his
hollow voice prithee be seated at my
table

  zotulla saw that a chair of ebony had
been placed for him opposite namirrha
and another chair less stately and im-
perial had been placed at the left hand
for obexah and the twain seated them-
selves and zotulla saw that his people
were sitting likewise at other tables
throughout the huge hall with the fright-
ful servitors of namirrha waiting upon
them busily like devils attending the
damned

  then zotulla perceived that a dark and
corpse-like hand was pouring wine for
him in a crystal cup and upon the hand
was the signet-ring of the emperors of
xylac set with a monstrous fire-opal in
the mouth of a golden bat even such a
ring as zotulla himself wore perpetually
on his index-finger and turning he be-
held at his right hand a figure that bore
the likeness of his father pithaim after
the poison of the adder spreading
through all his limbs had left behind it
the purple bloating of death and zo-
tulla who had caused the adder to be
placed in the bed of pithaim cowered in
his seat and trembled with a guilty fear
and the thing that wore the similitude of
pithaim whether corpse or ghost or an
image wrought by namirrhas enchant-
ment came and went at zotullas elbow
waiting upon him with stark black swol-
the dark eidolon



len fingers that never fumbled horribly
he was aware of its bulging unregarding
eyes and its livid purple mouth that was
locked in a rigor of mortal silence and
the spotted adder that peered at intervals
with chill orbs from its heavy-folded
sleeve as it leaned beside him to replen-
ish his cup or to serve him with meat
and dimly through the icy mist of his
terror the emperor beheld the shadowy-
armored shape like a moving replica of
the still grim statue of thasaidon which
namirrha had reared up in his blasphemy
to perform the same office for himself
and vaguely without comprehension he
saw the dreadful ministrant that hovered
beside obexah a flayed and eyeless
corpse in the image of her first lover a
boy from cyntrom who had been cast
ashore in shipwreck on the isle of the
torturers there obexah had found him
lying beyond the ebbing wave and reviv-
ing the boy she had hidden him awhile
in a secret cave for her own pleasure and
had brought him food and drink later
wearying she had betrayed him to the
torturers and had taken a new delight
in the various pangs and ordeals inflicted
upon him before death by that cruel
pernicious people

   drink said namirrha quaffing a
strange wine that was red and dark as
if with disastrous sunsets of lost years
and zotulla and obexah drank the wine
feeling no warmth in their veins there-
after but a chill as of hemlock mounting
slowly toward the heart

   verily tis a good wine said na-
mirrha and a proper one in which to
toast the furthering of our acquaintance
for it was buried long ago with the royal
dead in amphorae of somber jasper
shapen like funeral urns and my ghouls
found it whenas they came to dig in
tasuun

   now it seemed that the tongue of zo-

tulla froze in his mouth as a mandrake
freezes in the rime-bound soil of winter
and he found no reply to namirrhas
courtesy

  prithee make trial of this meat
quoth namirrha for it is very choice
being the flesh of that boar which the
torturers of uccastrog are wont to pas-
ture on the well-minced leavings of their
wheels and racks and moreover my
cooks have spiced it with the powerful
balsams of the tomb and have farced it
with the hearts of adders and the tongues
of black cobras

  naught could the emperor say and
even obexah was silent being sorely
troubled in her turpitude by the presence
of that flayed and piteous thing which
had the likeness of her lover from cyn-
trom and her dread of the necromancer
grew prodigiously for his knowledge of
this old forgotten crime and the raising
of the fantasm appeared to her a more
baleful magic than all else

  now i fear said namirrha that
you find the meat devoid of savor and
the wine without fire so to enliven our
feasting i shall call forth my singers and
my musicians

  he spoke a word unknown to zotulla
or obexah which sounded throughout
the mighty hall as if a thousand voices in
turn had taken it up and prolonged it
anon there appeared the singers who
were she-ghouls with shaven bodies and
hairy shanks and long yellow tushes full
of shredded carrion curving across their
chaps from mouths that fawned hyena-
wise on the company behind them en-
tered the musicians some of whom were
male devils pacing erect on the hind-
quarters of sable stallions and plucking
with the fingers of white apes at lyres of
the bone and sinew of cannibals from
naat and others were pied satyrs puffing
their goatish cheeks at hautboys made


weird tales

from the femora of young witches or
bagpipes formed from the bosom-skin of
negro queens and the horn of rhinoceri

  they bowed before namirrha with
grotesque ceremony then without delay
the she-ghouls began a most dolorous and
execrable howling as of jackals that have
sniffed their carrion and the satyrs and
devils played a lament that was like the
moaning of desert-born winds through
forsaken palace harems and zotulla
shivered for the singing filled his mar-
row with ice and the music left in his
heart a desolation as of empires fallen
and trod under by the iron-shod hooves
of time ever amid that evil music he
seemed to hear the sifting of sand across
withered gardens and the windy rustling
of rotted silks upon couches of bygone
luxury and the hissing of coiled serpents
from the low fusts of shattered columns
and the glory that had been ummaos
seemed to pass away like the blown pil-
lars of the simoom

  now that was a brave tune said
namirrha when the music ceased and the
she-ghouls no longer howled but verily
i fear that you find my entertainment
somewhat dull therefore my dancers
shall dance for you

  he turned toward the great hall and
described in the air an enigmatic sign
with the fingers of his right hand in
answer to the sign a hueless mist came
down from the high roof and hid the
room like a fallen curtain for a brief in-
terim there was a babel of sounds con-
fused and muffled beyond the curtain
and a crying of voices faint as if with
distance

  then dreadfully the vapor rolled
away and zotulla saw that the laden
tables were gone in the wide inter-
spaces of the columns his palace-inmates
the chamberlains the eunuchs the cour-
tiers and odalisques and all the others lay

trussed with thongs on the floor like so
many fowls of gorgeous plumage above
them in time to a music made by the
lyrists and flutists of the necromancer a
troupe of skeletons pirouetted with light
clickings of their toe-bones and a rout
of mummies bounded stiffly and others
of namirrhas creatures moved with
monstrous caperings to and fro they
leapt on the bodies of the emperors peo-
ple in the paces of an evil saraband at
every step they grew taller and heavier
till the saltant mummies were as the
mummies of anakim and the skeletons
were boned like colossi and louder the
music rose drowning the faint cries
of zotullas people and huger still
became the dancers towering far into
vaulted shadow among the vast columns
with thudding feet that wrought thunder
in the room and those whereon they
danced were as grapes trampled for a
vintage in autumn and the floor ran deep
with a sanguine must

  as a man drowning in a noisome
night-bound fen the emperor heard the
voice of namirrha

  it would seem that my dancers please
you not so now i shall present you a
most royal spectacle arise and follow
me for the spectacle is one that requires
an empire for its stage

zotulla and obexah rose from their
chairs in the fashion of night-walk-
ers giving no backward glance at their
ministering phantoms or the hall where
the dancers bounded they followed na-
mirrha to an alcove beyond the altar of
thasaidon thence by the upward-coil-
ing stairways they came at length to a
broad high balcony that faced zotullas
palace and looked forth above the city
roofs toward the bourn of sunset

  it seemed that several hours had gone
by in that hellish feasting and entertain-
the dark eidolon



ment for the day was near to its close
and the sun which had fallen from sight
behind the imperial palace was barring
the vast heavens with bloody rays

  behold said namirrha adding a
strange vocable to which the stone of the
edifice resounded like a beaten gong

  the balcony pitched a little and zo-
tulla looking over the balustrade beheld
the roofs of ummaos lessen and sink be-
neath him it seemed that the balcony
flew skyward to a prodigious height and
he peered down across the domes of his
own palace upon the houses the tilled
fields and the desert beyond and the
huge sun brought low on the deserts
verge and zotulla grew giddy and the
chill airs of the upper heavens blew upon
him but namirrha spoke another word
and the balcony ceased to ascend

  look well said the necromancer
on the empire that was yours but shall
be yours no longer then with arms
outstretched toward the sunset and the
gulfs beyond the sunset he called aloud
the twelve names that were perdition to
utter and after them the tremendous in-
vocation gna padanbis devomprd
tbungis furidor avoragomon

  instantly it seemed that great ebon
clouds of thunder beetled against the sun
lining the horizon the clouds took the
form of colossal monsters with heads and
members somewhat resembling those of
stallions rearing terribly they trod down
the sun like an extinguished ember and
racing as in some hippodrome of titans
they rose higher and vaster coming to-
ward ummaos deep calamitous rum-
blings preceded them and the earth
shook visibly till zotulla saw that these
were not immaterial clouds but actual
living forms that had come forth to tread
the world in macrocosmic vastness
throwing their shadows for many
leagues before them the coursers charged

as if devil-ridden into xylac and their
feet descended like falling mountain
crags upon far oases and towns of the
outer waste

  like a many-turreted storm they came
and it seemed that the world sank gulf-
ward tilting beneath the weight still as
a man enchanted into marble zotulla
stood and beheld the ruining that was
wrought on his empire and closer drew
the gigantic stallions racing with incon-
ceivable speed and louder was the thun-
dering of their footfalls that now began
to blot the green fields and fruited orch-
ards lying for many miles to the west of
ummaos and the shadow of the stal-
lions climbed like an evil gloom of
eclipse till it covered ummaos and look-
ing up the emperor saw their eyes half-
way between earth and zenith like bale-
ful suns that glare down from soaring
cumuli

  then in the thickening gloom above
that insupportable thunder he heard the
voice of namirrha crying in mad
triumph

  know zotulla that i have called up
the coursers of thamorgorgos lord of
the abyss and the coursers will tread
your empire down even as your palfrey
trod and trampled in former time a beg-
gar-boy named narthos and learn also
that i namirrha was that boy and
the eyes of namirrha filled with a vain-
glory of madness and bale burned like
maln disastrous stars at the hour of
their culmination

  to zotulla wholly mazed with the
horror and tumult the necromancers
words were no more than shrill shrieked
overtones of the tempest of doom and he
understood them not tremendously
with a rending of staunch-built roofs and
an instant cleavage and crumbling down
of mighty masonries the hooves de-
scended upon ummaos fair temple-


weird tales

domes were pashed like shells of the
haliotis and haughty mansions were
broken and stamped into the ground even
as gourds and house by house the city
was trampled flat with a crashing a of
worlds beaten into chaos far below in
the darkened streets men and camels fled
like scurrying emmets but could not
escape and implacably the hooves rose
and fell till ruin was upon half the city
and night was over all the palace of
zotulla was trodden under and now the
forelegs of the coursers loomed level with
namirrhas balcony and their heads tow-
ered awfully above it seemed that they
would rear and trample down the necro-
mancers house but at that moment they
parted to left and right and a dolorous
glimmering came from the low sunset
and the coursers went on treading under
them that portion of ummaos which lay
to the eastward and zotulla and obexah
and namirrha looked down on the citys
fragments as on a shard-strewn midden
and heard the cataclysmic clamor of the
hooves departing toward eastern xylac

  now that was a goodly spectacle
quoth namirrha then turning to the
emperor he added malignly think not
that i have done with thee however or
that doom is yet consummate

  it seemed that the balcony had fallen
to its former elevation which was still a
lofty vantage above the sharded ruins
and namirrha plucked the emperor by
the arm and led him from the balcony to
an inner chamber while obexah followed
mutely the emperors heart was crushed
within him by the trampling of such ca-
lamities and despair weighed upon him
like a foul incubus on the shoulders of a
man lost in some land of accursed night
and he knew not that he had been parted
from obexah on the threshold of the
chamber and that certain of namirrhas
creatures appearing like shadows had

compelled the girl to go downward with
them by the stairs and had stifled her out-
cries with their rotten cerements as they
went

the chamber was one that namirrha
used for his most unhallowed rites
and alchemies the rays of the lamps that
illumed it were saffron-red like the spilt
ichor of devils and they flowed on alu-
dels and crucibles and black athanors and
alembics whereof the purpose was hardly
to be named by mortal man the sorcerer
heated in one of the alembics a dark
liquid full of star-cold lights while zo-
tulla looked on unheeding and when
the liquid bubbled and sent forth a spiral
vapor namirrha distilled it into goblets
of gold-rimmed iron and gave one of the
goblets to zotulla and retained the other
himself and he said to zotulla with a
stern imperative voice i bid thee quaff
this liquor

  zotulla fearing that the draft was poi-
son hesitated and the necromancer re-
garded him with a lethal gaze and cried
loudly fearest thou to do as i and
therewith he set the goblet to his lips

  so the emperor drank the draft con-
strained as if by the bidding of some
angel of death and a darkness fell upon
his senses but ere the darkness grew
complete he saw that namirrha had
drained his own goblet then with un-
speakable agonies it seemed that the em-
peror died and his soul floated free and
again he saw the chamber though with
bodiless eyes and discarnate he stood in
the saffron-crimson light with his body
lying as if dead on the floor beside him
and near it the prone body of namirrha
and the two fallen goblets

  standing thus he beheld a strange
thing for anon his own body stirred and
arose while that of the necromancer re-
mained still as death and zotulla
the dark eidolon



looked on his own lineaments and his
figure in its short cloak of azure samite
sewn with black pearls and balas-rubies
and the body lived before him though
with eyes that held a darker fire and a
deeper evil than was their wont then
without corporeal ears zotulla heard the
figure speak and the voice was the
strong arrogant voice of namirrha say-
ing

  follow me o houseless phantom and
do in all things as i enjoin thee

  like an unseen shadow zotulla fol-
lowed the wizard and the twain went
downward by the stairs to the great ban-
quet hall they came to the altar of
thasaidon and the mailed image with
the seven horse-skull lamps burning be-
fore it as formerly upon the altar zo-
tullas beloved leman obexah who alone
of women had power to stir his sated
heart was lying bound with thongs at
thasaidons feet but the hall beyond was
deserted and nothing remained of that
saturnalia of doom except the fruit of
the treading which had flowed together
in dark pools among the columns

  namirrha using the emperors body
in all ways for his own paused before
the dark eidolon and he said to the spirit
of zotulla be imprisoned in this
image without power to free thyself or
to stir in any wise

  being wholly obedient to the will of
the necromancer the soul of zotulla was
embodied in the statue and he felt its
cold gigantic armor about him like a
strait sarcophagus and he peered forth
immovably from the bleak eyes that were
overhung by its carven helmet

  gazing thus he beheld the change that
had come on his own body through the
sorcerous possession of namirrha for
below the short azure cloak the legs had
turned suddenly to the hind legs of a
black stallion with hooves that glowed

redly as if heated by infernal fires and
even as zotulla watched this prodigy the
hooves glowed white and incandescent
and fumes mounted from the floor be-
neath them

  then on the black altar the hybrid
abomination came pacing haughtily to-
ward obexah and smoking hoofprints
appeared behind it as it came pausing
beside the girl who lay supine and help-
less regarding it with eyes that were pools
of frozen horror it raised one glowing
hoof and set the hoof on her naked bosom
between the small breast-cups of golden
filigree begemmed with rubies and the
girl screamed beneath that atrocious
treading as the soul of one newly damned
might scream in hell and the hoof glared
with intolerable brilliance as if freshly
plucked from a furnace wherein the
weapons of demons were forged

  at that moment in the cowed and
crushed and sodden shade of the emperor
zotulla close-locked within the adaman-
tine image there awoke the manhood
that had slumbered unaroused before the
ruining of his empire and the trampling
under of his retinue immediately a great
abhorrence and a high wrath were alive
in his soul and mightily he longed for
his own right arm to serve him and a
sword in his right hand

  then it seemed that a voice spoke
within him chill and bleak and awful
and as if uttered inwardly by the statue
itself and the voice said i am
thasaidon lord of the seven hells be-
neath the earth and the hells of mans
heart above the earth which are seven
times seven for the moment o zotulla
my power is become thine for the sake of
a mutual vengeance be one in all ways
with the statue that has my likeness even
as the soul is one with the flesh behold
there is a mace of adamant in thy right
hand lift up the mace and smite


weird tales

  zotulla was aware of a great power
within him and giant thews about him
that thrilled with the power and re-
sponded agilely to his will he felt in
his mailed right hand the haft of the
huge spiky-headed mace and though the
mace was beyond the lifting of any man
in mortal flesh it seemed no more than a
goodly weight to zotulla then rearing
the mace like a warrior in battle he struck
down with one crashing blow the im-
pious thing that wore his own rightful
flesh united with the legs and hooves of
a demon courser and die thingcrumpled
swiftly down and lay with the brain
spreading pulpily from its shattered skull
on the shining jet and the legs twitched
a little and then grew still and the
hooves glowed from a fiery blinding
white to the redness of red-hot iron cool-
ing slowly

for a space there was no sound other
than the shrill screaming of the girl
obexah mad with pain and the terror of
those prodigies which she had beheld
then in die soul of zotulla grown sick
with that screaming the chill awful
voice of thasaidon spoke again

  go free for there is nothing more
for thee to do so the spirit of zotulla
passed from the image of thasaidon and
found in the wide air the freedom of
utter nothingness and oblivion

  but the end was not yet for namirrha
whose mad arrogant soul had been
loosened from zotullas body by the
blow and had returned darkly not in die
manner planned by the magician to its
own body lying in the room of accursed
rites and forbidden transmigrations
there namirrha woke anon with a dire
confusion in his mind and a partial for-
getfulness for the curse of thasaidon
was upon him now because of his
blasphemies

  nothing was clear in his thought ex-
cept a malign exorbitant longing for re-
venge but the reason thereof and the
object were as doubtful shadows and
still prompted by that obscure animus he
arose and girding to his side an en-
chanted sword with runic sapphires and
opals in its hilt he descended the stairs
and came again to the altar of thasaidon
where the mailed statue stood impassive
as before with the poised mace in its im-
movable right hand and below it on the
altar the double sacrifice

  a veil of weird darkness was upon the
senses of namirrha and he saw not the
stallion-legged horror that lay dead with
slowly blackening hooves and he heard
not the moaning of the girl obexah who
still lived beside it but his eyes were
drawn by the diamond mirror that was
upheld in the claws of black iron basilisks
beyond the altar and going to the mirror
he saw therein a face that he knew no
longer for his own and because his eyes
were shadowed and his brain filled with
shifting webs of delusion he took the
face for that of the emperor zotulla in-
satiable as hells own flame his old
hatred rose within him and he drew the
enchanted sword and began to hew there-
with at the reflection sometimes because
of the curse laid upon him and the im-
pious transmigration which he had per-
formed he thought himself zotulla war-
ring with the necromancer and again in
the shiftings of his madness he was
namirrha smiting at the emperor and
then without name he fought a nameless
foe and soon the sorcerous blade
though tempered with formidable spells
was broken close to the hilt and na-
mirrha beheld the image still unharmed
then howling aloud the half-forgotten
runes of a most tremendous curse mrde
invalid through his forgettings he ham-
the dark eidolon



oered still with the heavy sword-hilt on
the mirror till the runic sapphires and
opals cracked in the hilt and fell away at
his feet in little fragments

  obexah dying on the altar saw na-
mirrha battling with his image and the
spectacle moved her to mad laughter like
the pealing of bells of ruined crystal and

above her laughter and above the curs-
ings of namirrha there came anon like
a rumbling of swift-risen storm the thun-
der made by the macrocosmic stallions
of thamogorgos returning gulfward
through xylac over ummaos to trample
down the one house that they had spared
aforetime

i east in the abbey

              by robert bloch

the story of a grisly honor encountered in a weird monastery

                                    in the forest

a clap of thunder in the sullen west
heralded the approach of night
and storm together and the sky
deepened to a sorcerous black rain fell
the wind droned dolefully and the forest
pathway through which i rode became a
muddy treacherous bog that threatened
momentarily to ensnare both my steed
and myself in its unwelcome embrace a
journey under such conditions is most in-
auspicious in consequence i was greatly
heartened when shortly through the
storm-tossed branches i discerned a
flicker of hospitable light glimmering
through mists of rain

  five minutes later i drew rein before
the massive doors of a goodly-sized ven-
erable building of gray moss-covered
stone which from its extreme size and
sanctified aspect i rightly took to be a
monastery even as i gazed thus perfunc-
torily upon it i could see that it was a
place of some importance for it loomed
most imposingly above the crumbled
foundations of many smaller buildings

which had evidently once surrounded it

  the force of the elements however
was such as to preclude all further in-
spection or speculation and i was only
too pleased when in reply to my con-
tinued knocking the great oaken door
was thrown open and i stood face to face
with a cowled man who courteously
ushered me past the rain-swept portals
into a well-lighted and spacious hallway

  my benefactor was short and fat
garbed in voluminous gabardine and
from his ruddy beaming aspect seemed
a very pleasant and affable host he in-
troduced himself as the abbot henricus
head of the monkish fraternity in whose
headquarters i now found myself and
begged me to accept the hospitality of the
brethren until the inclemencies of the
weather had somewhat abated

  in reply i informed him of my name
and station and told him that i was jour-
neying to keep tryst with my brother in
vironne beyond the forest but had been
arrested in my journey by the storm


weird tales

  these civilities having been concluded
he ushered me past the paneled ante-
chamber to the foot of a great staircase
set in stone that seemed hewn out of the
very wall itself here he called out
sharply in an uncomprehended tongue
and in a moment i was startled by the
sudden appearance of two blackamoors
who seemed to have materialized out of
nowhere so swiftly silent had been their
coming their stern ebony faces kinky
hair and rolling eyes set off by a most
outlandish garb-great baggy trousers of
red velvet and waists of cloth-of-gold in
eastern fashion-intrigued me greatly
though they seemed curiously out of place
in a christian monastery

  the abbot henricus addressed them
now in fluent latin bidding one to go
without and care for my horse and order-
ing the other to show me to an apartment
above where he informed me i could
change my rain-bedraggled garments for
a more suitable raiment while awaiting
the evening meal

  i	thanked my courteous host and fol-
lowed the silent black automaton up the
great stone staircase the flickering torch
of the giant servitor cast arabesque shad-
ows upon bare stone walls of great age
and advanced decrepitude clearly the
structure was very old indeed the mas-
sive walls that rose outside must have
been constructed in a bygone day for the
other buildings that presumably were
contemporaneously erected beside this
had long since fallen into irremediable
unrecognizable decay

  upon reaching the landing my guide
led me along a richly carpeted expanse
of tessellated floor between lofty walls
tapestried and bedizened with draperies
of black such velvet finery was most un-
seemly for a place of worship to my
mind

  nor was my opinion shaken by the

sight of the chamber which was indicated
as my own it was fully as large as my
fathers study at nimes-its walls hung
in spanish velvets of maroon of an ele-
gance surpassed only by their bad taste in
such a place there was a bed such as
would grace the palace of a king furni-
ture and odier appurtenances were of
truly regal magnificence the blackamoor
lighted a dozen mammoth candles in the
silver candelabra that stood about the
room and then bowed and withdrew

  upon inspecting the bed i found there-
upon the garments the abbot had desig-
nated for my use during the evening
meal these consisted of a suit of black
velveteen with satin breeches and hose
of a corresponding hue and a sable sur-
plice upon doffing my travel-worn ap-
parel i found that they fitted perfectly
albeit most somberly

  during this time i engaged myself in
observing the room more closely i won-
dered greatly at the lavishness display
and ostentation and more greatly still at
the complete absence of any religious
paraphernalia-not even a simple cruci-
fix was visible surely this order must be
a rich and powerful one albeit a trifle
worldly perchance akin to those societies
of malta and cyprus whose licentiousness
and extravagance is the scandal of the
world

  as i thus mused there fell upon my
ears the sounds of sonorous chanting that
swelled symphonically from somewhere
far below its measured cadence rose and
fell solemnly as if it were borne from a
distance incredible to human ears it was
subtly disturbing i could distinguish
neither words nor phrases that i knew
but the potent rhythm bewildered me it
welled a malefic rune fraught with in-
sidious strange suggestion abruptly it
ceased and i breathed unconsciously a
sigh of relief but not an instant during

                    w t-
the feast in the abbey



the remainder of my sojourn was i
wholly free from the spark of unease gen-
erated by the far-distant sound of that
nameless measured chanting from below



never have i eaten a stranger meal
than that which i partook of at the
monastery of the abbot henricus the
banquet hall was a triumph of ostenta-
tious adornment the meal took place in
a vast chamber whose lofty eminence rose
the entire height of the building to the
arched and vaulted roof the walls were
hung with tapestries of purple and blood-
royal emblazoned with devices and
escutcheons of noble albeit to me un-
known significance the banquet table
itself extended the length of the chamber
-at one end unto the double doors
through which i had entered from the
stairs the other end was beneath a hang-
ing balcony under which was the scullery
entrance about this vast festal board
were seated some two-score churchmen in
cowls and gabardines of black who were
already eagerly assailing the multitudi-
nous array of foodstuffs with which the
table was weighted they scarcely ceased
their gorging to nod a greeting when the
abbot and i entered to take our place at
the head of the table but continued to
devour rapaciously the wonderful array
of victuals set before them accomplishing
this task in a most unseemly fashion the
abbot neither paused to motion me to my
seat nor to intone a blessing but immedi-
ately followed the example of his flock
and proceeded directly to stuff his belly
with choice titbits before my astounded
eyes it was certain that these flemish
barbarians were far from fastidious in
their table habits the meal was accom-
panied by uncouth noises from the
mouths of the feasters the food was taken
up in the fingers and the untasted re-
w t-

mains cast upon the floor the common
decencies were often ignored for a
moment i was dumfounded but natural
politeness came to my rescue so that i
fell to without further ado

  half a dozen of the black servants
glided silently about the board replenish-
ing the dishes or bearing platters filled
with new and still more exotic viands
my eyes beheld marvels of cuisine upon
golden platters-verily but pearls were
cast before swine for these cowled and
hooded brethren monks though they
were behaved like abominable boors
they wallowed in every kind of fruit-
great luscious cherries honeyed melons
pomegranates and grapes huge plums
exotic apricots rare figs and dates there
were huge cheeses fragrant and mellow
tempting soups raisins nuts vegetables
and great smoking trays of fish all served
with ales and cordials that were as potent
as the nectar of nepenthes

  during the meal we were regaled with
music from unseen lutes wafted from
the balconies above music that trium-
phantly swelled in an ultimate crescendo
as six servitors marched solemnly in
bearing an enormous platter of massy
beaten gold in which reposed a single
haunch of some smoking meat garnished
with and redolent of aromatic spices in
profound silence they advanced and set
down their burden in the center of the
board clearing away the giant candelabra
and smaller dishes then the abbot rose
knife in hand and carved the roast the
while muttering a sonorous invocation in
an alien tongue slices of meat were ap-
portioned to the monks of the assemblage
on silver plates a marked and definite
interest was apparent in this ceremony
only politeness restrained me from ques-
tioning the abbot as to the significance of
die companys behavior i ate a portion
of my meat and said nothing


weird tales

  to find such barbaric dalliance and
kingly pomp in a monastic order was in-
deed curious but my curiosity was regret-
tably dulled by copious imbibing of the
potent wines set before me at the table
in beaker bumper flask flagon and be-
jeweled cup there were vintages of every
age and distillation curious fragrant po-
tions of marvelous headiness and giddy
sweetness that affected me strangely

  the meat was peculiarly rich and
sweet i washed it down with great
drafts from the wine-vessels that were
now freely circulating about the table
the music ceased and the candle-glow
dimmed imperceptibly into softer lumi-
nance the storm still crashed against the
walls without the liquor sent fire
through my veins and queer fancies ran
riot through my addled head

  i sat almost stupefied when the com-
panys trenchermannish appetites being
at last satisfied they proceeded under in-
fluence of the wine to break the silence
observed during the meal by bursting into
the chorus of a ribald song their mirth
grew and broad jests and tales were told
adding to the merriment lean faces were
convulsed in lascivious laughter fat
paunches quivered with jollity some
gave way to unseemly noise and gross
gesture and several collapsed beneath the
table and were carried out by the silent
blacks i could not help but contrast the
scene with that in which i would have
figured had i reached vironne to take my
meal at the board of my brother the good
cure there would be no such noisome
ribaldry there i wondered vaguely if he
was aware of this monastic order so close
to his quiet parish

  then abruptly my thoughts returned
to the company before me the mirth
and song had given place to less savor
things as the candles dimmed and deep-
ening shadows wove their webs of dark-

ness about the banquet board talk
turned to vaguely alarming channels and
cowled faces took on a sinister aspect in
the wan and flickering light as i gazed
bemused about the board i was struck by
the peculiar pallor of the assembled faces
they shone whitely in the dying light as
with a distorted mockery of death even
the atmosphere of the room seemed
changed the rustling draperies seemed
moved by unseen hands shadows
marched along the walls hobgoblin
shapes pranced in weird processional over
the groined arches of the ceiling the
festal board looked bare and denuded-
dregs of wine besmirched the linen half-
eaten viands covered the tables expanse
the gnawed bones on the plates seemed
grim reminders of mortal fate

the conversation was ill-suited to fur-
ther my peace of mind-it was far
from the pious exhortations expected of
such a company talk turned to ghosts
and enchantments old tales were told
and infused with newer horror legends
recounted in broken whispers hints of
eldritch potency passed from wine-
smeared lips in tones sepulchrally muted

   i sat somnolent no longer i was nerv-
ous with an increasing apprehension
greater than i had ever known it was
almost as if i knew what was about to
happen when at last with a curious smile
the abbot began his tale and the monkish
presences hushed their whispers and
turned in their places to listen

   at the same time a black entered and
deposited a small covered platter before
his master who regarded the dish for a
moment before continuing his introduc-
tory remarks

   it was fortunate he began addressing
me that i had ventured here to stay the
evening for there had been other travel-
ers whose nocturnal sojournings in these
the feast in the abbey



woods had not reached so fortunate a
termination there was for example the
legendary devils monastery here
he paused and coughed abstractedly be-
fore continuing

  according to the accepted folk-lore of
the region this curious place of which he
spoke was an abandoned priory deep in
the heart of the woods in which dwelt a
strange company of the undead devoted
to the service of asmodeus often upon
the coming of darkness the old ruins
took on a preternatural semblance of their
vanished glory and the old walls were
reconstructed by demon artistry to be-
guile the passing traveler it was indeed
fortunate that my brother had not sought
me in the woods upon a night like this
for he might have blundered upon this
accursed place and been bewitched into
entrance whereupon according to the an-
cient chronicles he would be seized and
his body devoured in triumph by the
ghoulish acolytes that they might preserve
their unnatural lives with mortal suste-
nance

  all this was recounted in a whisper of
unspeakable dread as if it were some-
how meant to convey a message to my
bewildered senses it did as i gazed
into the leering faces all about me i real-
ized the import of those jesting words
the ghastly mockery that lay behind the
abbots bland and cryptic smile

  the devils monastery    subterrene
chanting of the rites to lucifer   
blasphemous magnificence but never the
sign of the cross  an abandoned priory

in the deep woods    wolfish faces glar-
ing into my own   

  then three things happened simulta-
neously the abbot slowly lifted the lid
of the small tray before him let us
finish the meat i think he said then
i screamed lastly came the merciful
thunder-clap that precipitated me the
laughing monks the abbot the platter
and the monastery into chaotic oblivion

  when i awoke i lay rain-drenched in
a ditch beside the mired pathway in wet
garments of black my horse grazed in
the forest ways near by but of the abbey
i could see no sign

  i staggered into vironne a half-day
later and already i was quite delirious
and when i reached my brothers home i
cursed aloud beneath the windows but
my delirium lapsed into raving madness
when he who found me there told me
where my brother had gone and his
probable fate and i swooned away upon
the ground

  i can never forget that place nor the
chanting nor the dreadful brethren but
i pray to god that i can forget one thing
before i die that which i saw before the
thunderbolt the thing that maddens me
and torments me all the more in view of
what i have since learned in vironne i
know it is all true now and i can bear
the knowledge but i can never bear the
menace nor the memory of what i saw
when the abbot henricus lifted up the lid
of the small silver platter to disclose the
rest of the meat   

  it was the head of my brother

behind their powerful lenses glinted as
the monkey that had actually been dead
for two weeks raised its paw to claw at
the life-restoring stream pouring into its
arteries if we had been publicity-seek-
ers the successful culmination of my
chiefs lifetime of experimenting would
have put us on the front page of news-
papers all over the world but for some
reason the little german held back

  nein wally ve are not ready yet

  but nancy follett when i told her
about it that night could not understand
the delay

  why darling bringing the dead back
to life its wonderful when people
learn about it someone will be sure to
offer you a salary big enough so that we
can get married

  well be married without waiting for
that sweetheart i told her and in less


than two months schmerzholt told me
that after he gets back from the experi-
mental biologists conference in berlin
hell give me a months vacation

  marvelous lets drive somewhere
and do something

  i begged off the breakneck speed at
which she drives that blue roadster of
hers is breath-taking for a staid scientist
like me besides i wanted to stay there
and plan what wed do for the next two
months

  before schmerzholt sailed however he
outlined enough research to keep me busy
for a year not including the time neces-
sary to look after our resurrected monkeys
a job that demanded almost the entire at-
tention of one person but jim briggs
doctor briggs with a string of letters
after his name even if he is younger than
i told him not to worry

  still my duties did cut into the time i
had hoped to spend with nancy when
you are trying to grow a cutaneous tissue
synthetically and need to add a drop of
some solution or other every half-hour
for ten days theres little chance of cover-
ing much country even with a speed
demon like nancy for a driver shes un-
happy unless shes hitting fifty miles or
better but that i suppose is what i
should expect from the red-headed elf
who was so soon to marry me

  we scientists are agnostics about telep-
athy waiting the results of further in-
vestigation but i know how uneasy i
felt around the laboratory that afternoon
the shattered timbrel



nothing went right one of the monkeys
ended the state of coma in which it had
existed ever since before schmerzholts
departure by dying the howling of the
dogs we use for experimental purposes
got more on my nerves than usual and
the shrill telephone ring so startled me
that i dropped the pan of analine i was
carrying across the operating-room

  briggs was nearest the phone but he
just stood there looking at me and at the
spreading red pool on the spotless tile

  i reached the phone first the voice
was breathless and choked as it asked for
doctor knapp i licked my dry lips and
answered

  oh doctor theres been an accident
a terrible accident miss follett is-

  dead i rasped where when

m

 e beat the ambulance to the scene
  of the auto wreck nancys blue
car still remained rammed against a tree
but the farmer in the neighboring house
and the two occupants of the truck that
had been hugging the wrong side of the
turn had pulled her out of the wreck and
laid her on a blanket

  it seemed impossible to believe she
was dead but though she had not a cut or
a visible bruise her heart had stopped
beating i was bent over her when the
ambulance clanged up i pushed back
the doctor no hands but mine should
touch her if anything remained to be
done for her-that gave me the idea my
choking cry brought briggs to his knees
beside me

  what is it wally he demanded

  weve got to get her to the labora-
tory

  at first the ambulance driver refused
it was his duty to take her to the hos-
pital but i insisted afterward he testi-
fied in court that i threatened to kill him
i dont know but it ended with his driv-

ing and with me in the rear my arms
about nancy and my voice screaming for
more speed

  by myself i took her to our operating-
room immaculate except for the angry
red spot on the tile like a little lake of
blood

  briggs arriving afterward said he
pounded for ten minutes on the locked
door before he made me hear and let him
in then he gasped on the operating-
table covered by a surgical sheet lay the
dead body of the girl i had expected to
marry

  what are you going to do wally
he cried

  weve brought animals back to life
i told him im going to revive nancy

  youre out of your head

  maybe but science saved monkeys
science is going to save my sweetheart or
im through with it for ever and youre
going to help me

  i caught him as he was sidling out of
the room vainly he protested i de-
manded his help mine would be the re-
sponsibility but alone i could not do what
i planned finally he sterilized me and
buttoned me into my operating-gown
though still protesting

  but look here i thundered every
doctor in the land would pronounce her
dead wouldnt they

   he tried nancys pupillary reflex

  shes dead he admitted

  and unless we do something shell
remain dead so if we can do anything
at all for her shell be better off than
now

  as we rigged up the teeter board i
could see that though he said nothing he
was set against what i proposed to do but
i went ahead i bound the girl i loved
to a sort of seesaw then biting my lips
i made my incisions as i had watched
schmerzholt so now i pumped in the


weird tales

epinephrin reagent to stimulate her heart
action the hepatin for its effect on her
liver the leucholchyle for nervous system
tone all in a blood and saline solution
from which the coagulating matter had
been filtered and from time to time i
glanced up at briggs whose eyes all i
could see above his mask remained fixed
on the pulmonamic machine with which
he was trying to start her breathing with
his gloved right hand he gently teetered
the board back and forth eight times a
minute

  outside it grew dark inside the oper-
ating-ioom dripping in the air heated to
lessen shock we watched blinking in the
glare of overhead lights i was dimly
conscious of people knocking at the door
but we did not open it when the tele-
phone bell annoyed me i hurled a pair
of hasmostats at it and sent the apparatus
crashing to silence on the tile and still
we watched feeding the life-giving fluids
into the body and waiting for them to
take effect

  yes waiting because somehow i had
no thought of failure the reason
schmerzholt went to the added expense
of buying monkeys for his experiments
was because their reactions parallel human
reactions if they had been restored after
two weeks of death nancy must come
back to me

  briggs called my attention to the blood
on my gown dripping from the lip i had
been worrying with my teeth as i worked
but i did not stop to change just then
i thought i saw a slight movement of her
mouth but when it was not repeated i
called it a product of my tensed imagina-
tion

  it was briggs who first detected the
trembling of nancys eyelids that gave
new vigor to our exhausted bodies and we
kept on until finally she gave a little moan

and slightly moved the hand that wore
the engagement ring i had given her

  and then briggs slumped to the floor

  i could not stop to help him even
though nancy had begun to breathe
again slowly i could not leave her even
for an instant not until the black of the
windows turned to gray and i knew she
was safe did i open the laboratory door
outside mrs follett dry-eyed and gray
sat folding and refolding her handker-
chief i gave her instructions and stum-
bled to a cot in our smoking-room i
slumped onto it

  when i awoke i discovered they had
moved her to the hospital since our lab-
oratory had no facilities to care for her
quickly i drove over still haggard the
doctor began questioning me but all i
said was that i had given her a blood
transfusion to replace what she had lost
in the accident for a moment he looked
at me queerly

  shes still unconscious was his an-
swer to my question from the shock
of course

  the next day i was given the same re-
port she was however as i saw her
resting easier breathing quicker and with
a better color but it was four days be-
fore she opened her eyes and then those
hazel eyes that used to sparkle at me were
glazed when i saw she did not recog-
nize me yet i soon left

  mornings and evenings i made my pil-
grimage to nancys bedside but when a
week passed and still she had not spoken
or recognized anyone the family began
to worry hour after hour the girl lay
unmoving her lusterless eyes fixed vacant-
ly on the ceiling saying nothing appar-
ently hearing nothing finally they de-
cided to call in a specialist i tried to
have them put it off until schmerzholts
arrival for we were expecting him in ten
days but they were frantic
the shattered timbrel



they made a good choice i dont
suppose there is a neuropathologist
of greater skill than doctor parker in the
midwest he made a thorough examina-
tion but i could see how puzzled he was
and while he talked in hopeful general-
ities to mr and mrs follett to me he
acknowledged that he was at sea

   it locks like pressure on the brain
somewhere but although ive used this
new x-ray technique there isnt the
slightest evidence of lesion even an in-
jury to the spinal column would partly
account for her condition if we could
find any you found no trace immediately
after the accident

   i assured him that i had no explana-
tion i still do not know what-except
shock-could have stopped her heart-
beats without leaving a wound and so
after promises to keep her under observa-
tion doctor parker left and i waited for
schmerzholt

   finally he arrived tanned and viva-
cious but he sobered instantly when he
saw me and by the time i had told him
the whole story he was so furious that he
choked i had thought that when a scien-
tist like schmerzholt had devoted a quar-
ter-century to the problem of methods of
restoring human life the acme of delight
would be the report of its successful use
but instead he became more enraged than
i have ever seen him he bombarded me
with german oaths

  you fool he ended aber tell me
instantly how is she

   getting better all the time she is still

dazed but doctor parker thinks-

  dazed snapped schmerzholt
dazed have you from the observation
of our monkeys learned nothing block-
head dont you know what to that
lovely girl you have done

   i tried to stammer a question

   dont you know he shrieked that

the instant blood stops flowing through
the brain a chemical change takes place
you revive her body perhaps but her
brain what of her brain dead dead
briggs tried to divert his anger by
quoting what i had said to him

  we thought anything at all that we
could do for her would be better than to
leave her dead

  the little german whirled on him

  so eh so you made her-what do
they call those haitian imbeciles-a zom-
bie and he-he loves her so he wants
her to live an idiot a lifetime of tor-
ture for everyone and perhaps you will
think you must marry her dummkopf
look what happens when i go away if
i had been here i would have broken all
the instruments and chloroformed you
first if it had not been impossible do
you think i would not have experimented
with people well now where are you
going

  after all what could i say to him i
went out slowly stopped at the store-
room and then on to the hospital there
i saw the girl i loved better than anything
in the world as beautiful as ever but
with the dull eyes of an idiot to my
kisses on her fiery hair her lips her fin-
gers she made no response then from
my pocket i drew a tiny bottle and emp-
tied its few flakes of powder into a glass
in my arms i clasped her as i held it to
her lips the nurse coming in found me
kissing a corpse

  they kept the name of the poison i
used out of the papers for after all if
people knew how painlessly death may be
summoned more of them might seek it
but everything else made front page head-
lines

the story i told at my trial was so fan-
tastic that none of the jury believed
it when briggs testified that nancy had


weird tales

been dead in the first place they thought
his words an attempt to shield a friend
from the beginning i knew there could
be only one possible sentence

  but now as i wait for the death guard
i have only one ambition somewhere in
one of these ponderous volumes on the
desk before me may hide the secret of a

way to awaken the brain as it is possible
to start heart and lungs functioning my
time on earth is short now but if i keep
looking   

  what they are waiting for me in the
death chamber then i must go nancy
you understand youll be waiting for
me nancy nancy

doctor graeme little thought how his deaths-head spider plot would redound
on his own head-a story about an egyptian mummy

this is exciting    waiting here
in my darkened study with only
the reading-lamp lighted on my
desk to hear the shrill harsh cries of the
newsboys calling the extra he will rate
an extra surely the good the great the
learned doctor barrion that is the
measure of fame in our america-to rate
an extra-and doctor barrion is-or may
i say already was-famous a bit too
famous perhaps for his own health
we are sorry doctor graeme but the
committee appointed to choose a curator
has decided in favor of doctor barrion
because of his wide fame as the author of
the amen monographs he-he-he
amen monographs i shall be the one
doctor barrion to write the last of your
amen monographs  an end to your
growing fame an end to your career and
to your interference with mine amen   
so let it be

   i wonder whether he is now unwrap-
ping the bitumen bandages from that fine
female mummy i so freely contributed to
his new curatorship always with his
own hands eh-because of the scarabs
and other amulets often wound in with
the bandages  so tempting to curio-
hunters and so easy to abstract he-he-
he there is one amulet wound in with
that mummys bandages you would have
done well to allow some curio-hunter to
abstract doctor barrion    but it is
too late to think of that now isnt it
one does not lightly change the habits of
a lifetime

   it is costing me something too my

mummy-not a very good mummy but a
genuine one-and one of my two deaths-
head spiders from hawaii it was clever
of me to think of my deaths-head spider
in this connection it is no larger than a
scarab strange that so tiny a creature
can distill death in twenty minutes they
say it is the only poisonous thing in that
paradise of the pacific and very rare even
there found only in the deep woods
where my two specimens were found
now i have only one

  i may need it for that young snip
skipsworth who took so great secret sat-
isfaction in condoling with me upon the
committees decision that sneer on his
face damn him and all of them and
besides they thought doctor barrion had
the kindlier stronger character-a de-
liberate insult kindlier maybe-none
but weaklings are kind-but stronger
well we shall soon learn who has proved
the stronger i am as strong as death
doctor barrion strong as death and not
kind you will not like your death   
but then i did not like your life and i am
stronger than you doctor barrion he-
he-he

  why dont they hurry with that extra
surely they wont hold so rare a piece of
news for the morning editions i cant
bear to sit here waiting waiting till
morning-yet i shall if i must i have
waited so many years already    surely
i can wait through one more night i
vonder what they will make of it those
newspapermen of course they will bring
in the old idea of a priestly curse upon

                                        


weird tales

tomb-robbers how mad it always made
dear doctor barrion to be classed with
tomb-robbers but they will bring that
up of course for the titillation of their
readers superstitions

  strange that so practical a people as
ours should be so superstitious we
whose duty it is to deal with the long
dead to rifle their tombs and to des-
ecrate their bodies  we are not
superstitious we couldnt afford such
a luxury as superstition in our business
could we doctor barrion we are not
superstitious we are scientists you and
i cold rational scientists he-he-he

  but perhaps even doctor barrion will
recant during those last twenty minutes
he may rave and sob he may shriek
prayers and promises to the priests of
amen i wish i could be there to hear   
but it is better to wait quietly in my dark-
ened study with my servants below to
swear that i have not been out since din-
ner if any swearing should be necessary
it wont be i have planned so surely
and so well no one can connect me with
the poor dear doctors mysterious death
it will be the curse of amen-ra upon a
grave-robber a fine end for you my
dear famous imperious colleague

was that a cry from the end of the
street wuxtry yes yes they
are calling the extra oh come closer
cry come closer quickly let me hear
it clearly the glad tidings of-what was
that a knock on my study door but
i left the strictest orders i was on no ac-
count to be disturbed

  is that you williams

  no answer strange    and annoy-
ing that my orders should be disregarded
yet on second thought it may be an ad-

ditional security that my voice shall be
heard from my locked study he-he-he
not bad that doctor graeme was in
his study with the door locked all eve-
ning i heard his voice    so the
good williams on the witness stand

  but i am mad to think so there will
be no occasion for any witnesses no
trial no witnesses death by misad-
venture a nice funeral  to which
i shall go in my easter sunday outfit
after sending an appropriate wreath
more expense    but it must all be re-
garded as an investment the committee
can have no other choice than doctor
graeme this time whats that

  i swear this waiting has given me the
jitters i thought i heard someone in the
room with me    but the door is
locked yes it is locked i say and no one
can get in fool i must get myself a
little drink here    heres to you
doctor barrion wherever whatever you
are now salve atque vale

  good god how did you get in the
door is locked locked i tell you i   
you    what is it you want doctor
barrion what is that strange phosphor-
escence about you is this some school-
boy trick what you came to bring
me back my deaths-head spider whats
that in your hand the spider impos-
sible    its death to the touch but
maybe it is dead maybe the bitumen-
bandages smothered it i was afraid of
that    but what am i saying i know
nothing of any deaths-head spider god
it isnt dead i saw it move

  be careful man for gods sake
theres death in your hand no   
no    keep it away from me its
death i tell you    horrible agonizing

the logs that had just been laid on
the fire were wet and as the pow-
erful yellow flames wrapped them
round long hissing spurts of steam broke
the silence

  at the table with its wine-bottles
glasses and candles four men sat-jacob-
ite conspirators for they were met in the
interests of the stuart king in exile
james the third-the pretender the gov-
ernment styled him the four were the
parson the messenger from king james
mr gartshore the scrivener and old
jem lambardiston the lord of the
manor

  mr gartshore was pondering a ques-
tion of finance for an answer to which
the others waited eventually he spoke

  not much above five thousand
pounds tell his majesty five thousand
guineas

  the messenger made a note and this
concluded the business of the evening
the parsons inclination now was to go
he was ill at ease sitting in old jems
house nothing short of the stuart
agents presence in it would have enticed
him over the threshold for not only had

   from weird tales for october 

he and old jem quarreled hotly in the
very first hour of their acquaintance some
eighteen months before rarely speaking
since but old jem was reputed to have
been a thoroughly bad man all his days
and in his eighty-seventh year to be ever
ready to gibe at good to talk with satis-
faction of his own misdeeds and to ap-
prove those of others the only spark in
his soul which was not a gleam of evil
it was commonly said was a sincere
wish that james iii could be placed on the
throne of his fathers

   so far tonight the affairs of the exile
had fully occupied old jem but with
the deliberations finished it was not im-
probable that his tongue would turn in
malice to themes and assertions which
would sharply wound the parson at
least thus the parson reasoned and his
ears were alert for an attack as he hesitated
betwixt remaining and showing discour-
tesy to the company by taking his leave

  however old jem tended to be silent
sunken a little in his chair he watched
the messenger fold his papers anon he
motioned him to fill his glass and drain-
ing his own he blinked and closed his
eyes breathing thickly

                                       


weird tales

  the parson though becoming drawn
into converse with mr gartshore looked
at his host strive as he would he could
feel no touch of that pity which the old so
often stir in one he could feel only de-
testation for the aged face in repose
partly encircled by a tumbled very white
peruke and now colored high by wine it
was for all its deep lines fleshy still
the under lip tinged with purple hung
loose the mouth seeming to leer lazily
yet because of the great puckers about it
it was no weak mouth but ruthless brow-
beating

   there is a lad in parliament said the
messenger buttoning his waistcoat over
his papers a mr faunce that spoke
cleverly on the witchcraft statutes we
should gain him to our side

   i have seen to it said the scrivener
he drank and put down his glass slowly
witchcraft he exclaimed a thrill of
anger in his voice that is some credit
to this year  it hath witnessed the
snuffing out of the witchcraft laws-and
therefore of witchcraft for the law and
the law only made witchcraft    to
think that in our day-twenty-five twen-
ty years back-the law of england was
murdering women and little girls for
witchcraft    mr parson sir i grant
you there was witchcraft in israel but
declare to me was there ever such in
england

  nay there was not answered the
parson emphatically

  old jems eyes opened faded and
watery they nevertheless bent on the par-
son a strong unwavering gaze and the
limp under lip stiffened truculently

  take back your nay parson he said
for i have been in witchraft ay i have
been in it-head and shoulders in as great
a piece of witchcraft as witch ever did-
and the place of it no farther off than our
town down yonder

  over his face a shadow came-the kind
of shadow that the parson would least
have expected to find there it hinted
that once old jem had met with some-
thing which had appalled even his iron
mind

  in our town said the parson i
have not heard-

  certes you have not twas away
back in king charles time - nigh to
three-score years ago they who were in
it with me are long since dead and twas
a thing we had no wish to talk of and
hoped we should forget old jem shook
his head with his lips pursed and his
eyes cloudy i have forgot no scrap no

 i 

jot

  voila then mr lambardiston said
the messenger give us the story

  no said old jem taking up his
snuff-box i would not have spoke this
much but the wiping out of the witch
laws by these perky fellows who are too
wise to believe in magic hath left me in
a fume and when gartshore there and
parson-

  he stopped surveying the scrivener
and parson in turn so ye deem it an
empty tale gartshore and you too par-
son for a few seconds his lips pressed
together tightly his face ever setting
harder decision growing in his eyes
which smoldered with exasperation very
well he cried ye shall have the tale
and if ye will go to the jail tomorrow ye
shall find some records that will savor of
its truth he raised himself and leaned
forward with his arms on the table

  the messenger breathed good mr
gartshore muttered something apologetic
and the parsons interest vanquished his
inclination to go

  now listen said old jem

  his voice was wonderfully powerful
for his years and he gave his narrative
with an orderliness and ease that were to
the supreme witch



be anticipated from one who in the past
had been reckoned one of the finest tory
orators in the house of commons

o	begin with he said i must go
back to the year - when
i was a lad of seventeen witchcraft
trials were frequent enough thenadays as
you do know and at the autumn assize
here we had the case of a woman who
lived in this very town her name was
shafto-ellen shafto she was a widow
whose man had been killed in the great
four days fight with the hollander
fleet she had two young children a boy
and a girl and was of no ripe age her-
self say twenty-eight and a pretty
woman she was dark-haired slim and
smiling with a sweet curve to the jaw and
a taking poise of the head-as i had be-
gun to note but despite her prettiness
and her poverty she was known as a very
honest woman having been ere she
came hither needle-maid to some modish
madam she kept herself and her children
by sewing for the gentlefolk roundabout
here

  now there was another woman-i
forget how called-who was her neigh-
bor and did work of a like kind and be-
twixt her and mrs shafto jealousy and
quarreling arose

  after a while it chanced that this
womans right hand and arm became
swelled so that she was sorely pained and
could not sew old doctor peters the
leech could in no wise get rid of the
swelling and was puzzled to discover a
cause for it

  a bruit spread that mrs shafto had
bewitched the arm accomplishing this by
standing at her window with a silk kirtle
across her own arm and her eyes held on
the other womans house at her trial
under threat of torture mrs shafto

pleaded guilty and was sentenced to be
hanged

  now mark this well she was to be
hanged in the market-place opposite the
red bull inn on the morning a great
and savage crowd was gathered there
groaning and yelling and bent to seize her
ere she reached the gallows-tree and to
give her a rougher death than by the rope
for witchcraft is a crime that oft will
drive a populace to a frenzy

  i was looking on from the red bull
ill enough pleased by the scene-being
young and the witch so comely and close
on nine oclock the hour for the hanging
everything appeared the horrider to me be-
cause of the strange quality of the day-
light it was november-for the assize
had come late the sun was but little
risen and shone weakly through a gap it
had melted in the thick murk which float-
ed over us the market-place was partly
shadows and partly a blotch of queer
heavy yellow light wherein the faces of
those who tiptoed to see if mrs shafto
were near-faces with teeth showing and
eyes wide open-had the look of waxen
masks

   of a sudden the bell in the clockhouse
commenced to ring nine the multitude
was stricken silent on the instant ah
were bewildered because mrs shafto was
not come but presently we caught the
sound of a huge angry cry from near the
jail and soon it was known that the
sheriff aware of what the mob intended
had called ralph timmins the hangman
to him and bidden him hang mrs shafto
privily which he did forthwith in her cell
putting the rope over a beam

  my father who was in the jail with
the sheriff told me afterwards that neither
the sheriff nor he went to see the execu-
tion done they stood with divers others
in the passage by the main door it being


weird tales

well-nigh dark save where a flood of the
dull yellow light fell this coming to
them through the window of a room
whereof the door opening upon the pas-
sage was swung wide back

  and anon my father said ralph tim-
mins walked down the stone stairs to
them and was near to falling at the last
step on account of the gloom and salut-
ing the sheriff he quoth sir i have put
the young witch away as your worship
bid 

  old jem stopped to pour some wine
presently the scrivener asked

  and the womans arm

  mended from that day said old
jem oh ellen shafto was a witch
doubt it not and maybe her power was
far vaster than she showed but she is
not the witch of my tale-the supreme
witch that was more potent than a score
of ellens

  now harken again

   it was i said in  that ellen shafto
was hanged for the next twelve years
i came but little to these parts but my
father dying in  i removed hither
from london

  in a short while i learned that ellen
shaftos children the lad now aged twen-
ty-one and the girl eighteen still dwelt
near the town and one day i met this girl
in the street i knew her as soon as i saw
her for she woke my recollection of her
mother she was younger fresher even
slighter but she had the same dark curls
the same sweet curve of the jaw the same
alluring poise of the head only in the
expression of her face did she differ
much the mother was wont to be smil-
ing the daughters lips pouted though in
a pretty fashion and her eyebrows with
the line of a little frown between them
warned one of a temper

  i stopped her asking her name-

which she told me was nora-and inquir-
ing how she and her brother lived

  shyly but giving me no further curtsy
than that with which she had halted she
said that her brother had received a gift
of money from the lady in london in
whose service their mother had been
with this money he had leased a trifle of
land which he farmed and she dwelt
with him

  i spoke with her for several minutes
and had meant to drop a couple of guineas
into her palm but i noted a stormy spar-
kle in her eyes when the coins clinked in
my pocket so i let them fall bade and i
lifted not my fingers to her chin as i
turned away-from memory of that
stormy sparkle

  but there and then i was mightily in
love with nora shafto and i knew that
the winning of her was now to be the aim
of my life and that she would fight me
hard

old jems eyes which seemed grow-
ing dimmer and dimmer as he lost
himself more surely in the past half lit
for a moment and swept to the parson-
who discovered straightway to the dis-
comfiture of his conscience that in one
thing at least he had estimated old jem
unjustly

  i ask your pardon parson quoth
old jem for what i shall say next but
to give you a full understanding of my
story i must speak plainly

  his eyes moved from the parson

  as i said i was mightily in love with
nora shafto i had no thought to marry
her-though when twas too late i would
have wed her a dozen times over if that
could have brought her to me that she
was a witchs daughter and might be a
witch herself was naught to me i was
the sort of man who would have enjoyed
the supreme witch



to wed a witch for the fun of it-were
she a witch of birth but i was not the
sort of man to wed a needle-womans
daughter-were she white-souled as an
angel

  and certes nora shafto was that so
far as accepting my love was concerned
she could have loved me for a brief
while during which she let me speak
often with her i saw her affection for me
grow-grow radiant-burn forth but
that was before she knew i meant not
marriage afterwards-for months after-
wards i followed her waylaid her be-
sought her vainly the flame which had
burned was dead i offered her what she
would-gems by the handful gold and
more gold till she had the chance to beg-
gar me well-nigh she answered nay to
all not even a kiss did i get from her
save a flick of one which i snatched

  that was by the horse-pool below the
town of an evening in may of  i had
intercepted my young paragon and most
lovely was she to see a-stand with her
head thrown back and her color bright
holding me at a distance with her look
the frowning line was plain betwixt her
eyebrows her eyes were all anger and
there were revealed-one near each nos-
tril-two little stern furrows which some-
how made her face appear old without
taking away its youthfulness-a strange
blending that was hauntingly beautiful

  but of late her tongue and manner
had so scathed me that i could keep my
temper only by the hardest effort and
this evening being presently jabbed by a
retort from her i exclaimed

   nora verily you are a little spite
you answer nothing but bitterness and
spite to all i say and i have never spoke a
word to you that was not love and gentle-
ness-till now

  she was in no way disconcerted by my
new tone she seemed rather to feel

braced and of better self-assurance by
reason of it there was less anger in her
face and a good deal more of bold con-
tempt which is a thing to make one seethe
coming from a person of low birth

   ay you were very gentle mr lam-
bardiston-thinking to fill my ears with
toys said she using a common phrase of
the time farthing toys she added her
eyes most scornful

    farthing toys is a lie i said and
that you know well i strove to master
myself nora i promised-i promise
to put round your fingers round your
neck round your pretty curls toys worth
the ransom of this town    you will do
all the gaining i shall do all the spend-
ing-

  she moved her shoulders quickly lift-
ing her chin higher and looking deliber-
ately away from me

   ay thats your sleek prating she
said in a slow loathing way- you will
do all the spending    and you blamed
me for a liar you-that will do all the
spending    oh cried she looking
back to me-and i saw in her eyes that
she hated me-oh why doth it not choke
you-that damned lie you will spend
some bits of gold but i-i must spend
my soul-my soul    mr lambardiston
whines to me to buy him a little diversion
-with my soul let us two voyage
through loveland quoth he and  am
to pay for his voyage-with my soul
faugh you blackguard cur

  nora shafto was ready with words
and her voice was of a better-bred quality
than fitted her station-for after her
mothers hanging a lady of the district had
taken her into her house and cared for
her well until her own death but this
denouncement had more barbed wit than
anything she had given me yet-and it
smarted me mightily though i covered


weird tales

this with a laugh deeming that a kiss
would be ample amends for the invective
and determining that this instant i would
take it

  there was a horseman riding slowly
up the lane towards us but i cared not
for him and stepped across to nora with
a word of my intent i noted that in-
stead of seeking to dart aside she put her
hand to the basket of flower roots dug
from the hedge which she was carrying
and then my hands clapped on her shoul-
ders and my lips touched a comer of her
mouth as she jerked it past me

  she stamped swiftly on my foot-i
wore but shoes-threw off one of my
hands whirled and got free the basket
dropping to the ground and emptying
forth its plants from amid these she
whipped up a dull stout knife

   so that is mr lambardiston she
gasped mr lambardiston-of the great
gentry that visit the law on poor folk
mr lambardiston that was made deputy
sheriff a sennight since an attacker of
maids she showed me the knife i
want you to try again she said for yon-
der comes a gentleman that shall swear i
killed you fairly

  i had a good mind to try again but
the fellow on horseback had flipped up
his nag and was trotting forward all
a-grin and i had no sword with which to
stay him from interference whereas a
very long iron was jogging by his leg
withal as nora had fleered i was deputy
sheriff and could not but cut an unseem-
ly figure in the affair which by an argu-
ment with the arriving knave might be
much noised

  so i turned from her limping with
my hurt foot

   you witchs jade i said you have
the blade temper of a witch yourself

  i heard her draw in her breath at that
i heard her move as though she med-
itated to cast herself on my back but
then she spoke mockingly

   i knew it cried she i knew your
brutes mouth would go to my poor moth
er    oh ay i have a witchs temper
mr lambardiston and witchs craft
enough to keep myself out of your hands
however you strive

  at this last idle saying-as i deemed
it-i faced about for a moment and
quietly bade her cease from dangerous
words of witchcraft for though i never
would have repeated them to her harm
the horseman was now within earshot

  having given which warning i went
home

  two days afterwards her brother
francis shafto a big dour-visaged fellow
placed himself surlily with extreme im-
pudence in my path as i was entering the
town he threatened that if i so much as
spoke to nora henceforth he would so
beat me with his cudgel that i should lie
abed for many a week and he added
twas his belief no magistrate or judge
would do other than hold him justified in
this

  it was plain that i must have him
deared out of the place i wrote that
same day to a friend captain of a second-
rate of the navy and a week after this
half a dozen sailors went to shaftos farm
and impressed master francis for the sea
-most lawlessly i confess

  hearing that he was taken off with
nora left swooning from the fury with
which she had struggled to tear him from
the sailors i felt i had done cleverly his
release would be an additional bribe to
offer nora   

  i had not done deverly i had done
fatally

                    w t-
the supreme witch



hb first hint i got of the truth was
a report that the seamen on their
road to the coast with francis shafto had
been charged into by a vicious bull then
followed the news that no bull had at-
tacked them but a black filly which burst-
ing suddenly through a gate had raced
straightway upon them and biting lash-
ing trampling like a fiend had badly
tom one man broken the leg of another
and killed a third outright francis shaf-
to whose hands were tied because of
fight he had made at the farm was the
first to be knocked down but was not
harmed by the beast which presently set-
ting her teeth in his coat began to drag
him away but a sailor who by now had
drawn his whinger struck her on the
shoulder whereat she dropped shafto and
clattered off fast

  i was starting forth for london when
i had these tidings beyond being some-
what pleased that shafto was unhurt i
was little interested but returning hither
a few days later to renew matters with
nora i was prettily astounded to find
that she was in jail accused of having
changed herself into a black filly and slain
a sailor with the hope to rescue her
brother

  i will tell you what was evidenced
against her the filly when driven off by
the blow from the whinger was seen again
by no man nor was anyone in the country-
side to be found who owned her or re-
membered to have seen her at the time
of the onset nora was a day gone from
home having told her friends that she
would privily follow the press-party and
it might be persuade some folk to attack
it for her she came back on the day
after the fillys attack she was very
wearied and draggled and white and in
great pain from a cut across her shoulder
which had been done she said by strik-
ing against a fence in the dark

    w t-

  now the tale of the filly and the
whinger had reached here before her
and everyone knowing of her mother
tongues were already a-wag it needed
but the cut on noras shoulders to set the
town mad with excitement never had
there been so clear a case of a child in-
heriting evil magic and the strength of
this magic in nora she was a far more
dangerous witch than ever her mother
was the magistrates were clamored at to
commit her to prison and this was done
ere she had been home many hours--a
crowd lingering about the jail till nearly
midnight roaring and threatening to
break in to her and everyone saying that
no man could account himself safe while
she were alive

   knew not whether to believe nora a
witch or to flout the notion but i did
know one thing-she should be neither
hanged nor harmed if my influence could
shield her and i was very certain it could

  forthwith using my sheriff powers i
proclaimed penalties against any that
should make a turmoil outside the jail
and i called out and stationed therein a
score of train-bandmen armed to the eye-
lids i used the rough of my tongue to
the magistrates who had caused the arrest
and detention of nora instead of flog-
ging the mob that had clamored against
her

  and then i went to nora

  my purpose was to dispel her fears at
once to tell her that i would see she was
not put on trial at the assize that indeed
i would get her freed ere the week was
out and as i strode with the chief turn-
key to her cell i was sure she would read
much of this in my face and in her relief
and gratitude give me a kinder welcome
than of late

  when the fellow had unbarred the
door i bade him begone to a distance


weird tales

and swinging back the door myself i en-
tered the cell

  nora greeted me with a gasp of her
breath with stormshine in her eyes de-
spite that i came to a standstill she
moved facing me to the far wall lean-
ing against it with her head held back
and touching it she commenced to rage
at me her voice low for the most part
yet often thrown hither and thither by her
passion-the palms of her hands now and
again beating upon the wall

  what need to tell you her speech
twas the old tale of hate over again yet
now twice as bitter with its accusation
that i had planned her brothers carrying-
off whereby i was responsible for the
pass she was come to

  for a soace she would heed no word

                  x

of mine but anon she began to listen to
my protest that i would avert all peril
from her-obtain her quick release
while harkening she seemed to cool fast
from her rage her palms lying quite still
against the wall her eyes lacking luster
her face had become wooden as the say-
ing is this i little liked

   for your favor she said on my
pausing i am to love you is that the
compact

   scarce a compact i answered i am
not so mean a man i will not save you
unless you shall love me no no nora
yet i shall hope you will change to me
and mark you this-if you do your
brother shall swiftly be libertied from the
navy

   ah-h she said softly a dreaminess
in her eyes-eyes that were much my
study when i was with her they were so
fluent of expression so beautiful ah-h
she said in truth-in truth there is no
villain worse than you in all this villain
world for see you are high-placed with
my poor life and my brothers much in

your power wherefore you should be of
stem honor mr lambardiston-should
you not-that we and such as we could
ever trust you but what are you she
breathed between her set teeth with a
hissing sound if my mothers spirit is
here beside me she said of which i am
very sure what must she think of you
have you no whit of shame striving to
break me in the room where my mother
doubtless stands

   why doubtless here i asked

  she looked upwards following her
glance i saw above us a balk of dark oak
spanning the cell i exclaimed loudly
for i was moved by the cruel thoughtless-
ness which had caused nora to be placed
in the very room in which her mother was
hanged

    you shall be taken out of this i said
making a step to summon the turnkey

  but far from thanking me she
brought me to a halt by declaring she
would liefer remain and would entreat
mr palmer the governor of the jail to
put her back in this cell did i have her
removed

  the dreaminess had gone from her
eyes but for some seconds it came again
i could not tell whether she spoke chiefly
to me or to herself when she said

   i do remember my mother very well
though i had her for so little a time she
was a dear sweet mother and i know
doth yearn to hearten me now that i am
accused as she was  i think i am more
near to her in this room than i could be
elsewhere on earth her voice sank be-
coming a moan soft-scarce unhappy i
have wanted my mother none knows
how much she was all tender love and
the world is loneliness and cruel as stone
i shall be glad to go away to my mother
though i would it were not by the hang-
man
the supreme witch



  then her eyes meeting mine squarely
lit of a sudden there was a quick rous-
ing of her mind and body she started
from the wall and bent towards me but
rather would i go by hanging rather by
the roasting-post than come to you-you
sneaking dog ay an hundred times
rather

  it was clear she could not be reasoned
with that day i turned on my heel wast-
ing no more words and walking from
the jail i decided that my best plan would
be to seem to abandon her until she had
been put in greater fright than she vas in
at present i would let her stand her trial
which i doubted not would result in her
condemnation and then i would secure a
pardon

  old jem sipped from his glass setting
it down he relapsed in his chair and
clasped his hands without having looked
at any of his auditors his gaze brooded
darkly on the wall opposite him

  she was tried at the summer assize
she pleaded not guilty and was not
threatened with torture to make her alter
that for the judge was old jack phillips
no firm believer in witchcraft-as his
words to the jury showed but the jury
took only a few minutes to find her guil-
ty and she was condemned to be hanged
in the market-place where her mother
was to have been flung off

  already i had arranged almost fully
about getting the pardon and after the
case jack phillips threw in his weight
with me and i had the pardon in my
hands with forty hours to spare but i
meant to bring nora fairly to the ground
with no fight left in her this time i had
charge of the execution-holden the
sheriff being bedridden-and i intended
to say naught of the pardon until my pret-
ty one was within a few minutes of being
carted forth to the gibbet and the uproar
of the mob sounding from the market-

place should tell her that outside the
prison she would have no safety despite
her pardon except she drove forth with
me and my train-bandmen and lodged in
my house

  i would forbid any sheltering of her
in the jail and by a gift of drink to the
mob i should have inflamed it to an ex-
traordinary ferocity such as in her stub-
bomest hate of me she could not dream
to face oh i had miss nora in a rare
trap from which there was no escape but
into my doorway

  with her pardon under my pillow i
slept complacent of mind through the
night which she would deem to be her
last

t started for the jail early in the
morning-the clearest sweetest july
morning i had ever known with the hills
beyond the woods wondrous outstanding
and gleaming in the sunlight i went
afoot to enjoy the air having ordered my
coach to be at the jail for my return with
nora

  her hanging was to be at nine op-
posite the red bull passing behind the
market-place i felt the air a-tremble from
the vast confusion of voices coming
thence and at intervals these uplifted in
a shout of execration against her that nigh
stunned one-which noise reaching me as
i paused before the jail to warn a group
of persons that i should permit no gather-
ing there was like the tumbling down of
thousands of planks of vood

  i smiled to think what a tempest
would burst when the news of the pardon
spread i had increased my train-band-
men to fifty and to think what indigna-
tion would be shown by sundry gentle-
men who were to meet me in the jail-
when it was disclosed to them that the
pardon which they would have expected
instant tidings of was by no means newly


weird tales

arrived these same gentlemen-palmer
the governor captain jones and sir hugh
gerrow justices-were prone to take of-
fense at my high-handed acts as they
termed them

  however i saw not how the latter two
received the tidings for about half after
eight they being not yet come i informed
palmer bidding him tell them and went
up to noras cell on my way i met
ralph timmins the hangman who had
put her mother to death by means of the
beam in the cell he was an oldish man
now with his thin beard streaked white
and brown

   there be a riot of howling in the
market-square your worship said he
 tis as it was in her mothers time or
worse id affirm he rubbed his chin
with his knuckles a queer sad business
sir-these two both so pretty to look on
and like as a pair o pink roses

   you will have no hanging today
ralph i answered she is pardoned but
you shall nothing lose in fees unwill-
ing to stay even long enough to get out
some gold for him because of my eager-
ness to greet nora i added wait for me
below

  the door of noras cell was open two
turnkeys standing by the threshold i
gestured them away and walked in i
could perceive that nora had gone white
at the sound of my approach perchance
she knew not my step-thought one was
come to take her to the cart when i
confronted her the color began to come
again to her cheeks and the line of the
little frown between her eyebrows was
deeper than i had ever discerned it she
held herself rigid the fingers of one hand
gripping motionlessly a cluster of her
dark curls

  well i showed her the pardon i
lifted my finger telling her to listen to

the outcry in the market-place which was
borne to us and i explained to her that
only by taking refuge in my house could
she preserve herself from the savage
anger of the town not until that last did
her face lose its stoniness did her eyes
cease from looking balefully into mine

  she raised them towards the beam her
fingers twitched amid her curls oh my
mother-mother mother she said her
lips so quivering that  believed she
would fall to sobbing

   now come at once with me nora
i said gently

  she gave but one sob a strange sigh-
ing one and her gaze returned to me

   what if i ask mr palmer to harbor
me here

    will not allow him

   i had wagered that-bully of every
man then she spoke with greater
steadiness you believe you are the win-
ner betwixt us but i believe i quoth true
when i said i had witchs craft enough to
keep myself out of your hands

    come i said

  she took her fingers from her curls
and pointed to the pardon until that is
given to mr palmer his warranty to re-
lease me you can not force me to stir or
force any man to stir me bully whom you
shall and i will not stir exccpt mr
palmer comes hither to bid me or mr
drew doth bid me

  drew was the chief turnkey one of
the two who had been conversing with
her he had been present at her mothers
death and-i suspect-had been pitying
to the daughter

  frail though noras argument was i
made no dispute i should get her more
quickly to my coach by bending to her
whim i started immediately to go down
to palmer beckoning to drew to accom-

mgrath came upon the glade almost before he knew it the moon hung in
the low branches blood-red high enough to illumine it and the throng of
people who squatted in a vast semicircle about it facing the moon their
rolling eyes gleamed milkily in the shadows their features were grotesque masks
none spoke no head turned toward the bushes behind which he crouched

he had vaguely expected blazing fires a blood-stained altar drums and the chant
of maddened worshippers that would be voodoo but this was not voodoo and there
was a vast gulf between the two cults there were no fires no altars but the
breath hissed through his locked teeth in a far land he had sought in vain for the
rituals of zambebwei now he looked upon them within forty miles of the spot
where he was born

in the center of the glade the ground rose slightly to a flat level on this stood
a heavy iron-bound stake that was indeed but the sharpened trunk of a good-sized
pine driven deep into the ground and there was something living chained to that
stake-something which caused mcgrath to catch his breath in horrified unbelief

he was looking upon a god of zambebwei stories had told of such creatures
wild tales drifting down from the borders of the forbidden country repeated by
shivering natives about jungle fires passed along until they reached the ears of skep-
tical white traders mcgrath had never really believed the stories though he had
gone searching for the being they described for they spoke of a beast that was a
blasphemy against nature-a beast that sought food strange to its natural species

      continued from page 
pany me so that palmer could send him
back for nora then it came to my mind
that her boast anent witchs craft might
have some subtle meaning what if she
were planning to kill herself at once i
swung round and went to the entrance of
the cell whither the second turnkey was
advancing nora stood much as i had
left her

  i intercepted the turnkey whispered
that he should watch her narrowly then
giving one more glance at the sweetly
molded face and the eyes balefully fol-
lowing me i rejoined drew

  i found palmer and jones and sir
hugh gerrow standing in a passage with-
in the main door with ralph timmins a
yard or two from them waiting expectant-
ly for me within a minute palmer had
dispatched drew to bring nora to us and
then i had leisure to note that jones and
gerrow were even more cholerically silent
than i had anticipated i surmised that
they had been examining my motive in
taking nora to my house

  i let them have my back and gazed
along the passage to the stone stairs look-
ing for nora to appear round the bend of
them anon i recollected ralph timmins
and gave him three guineas which moved
him to very many thanks these how-
ever i scarce heeded for i was watching
the stairs again exasperation growing in
me as i realized that nora was contriving
somehow a long delay

    palmer i said presently that girl is
making a to-do of sorts-the little in-
grate i beg you go yourself and fetch
her

  i heard him take a step behind me
but then he spoke to timmins

    ralph go you and tell drew to hast-
en with her

    ay go ralph i said

timmins mounted the stairs at his
sharpest pace my three guineas were
spurring him yet when full time enough
was passed for him to have reached drew
and one of them be back with nora no
one came

   they are seeking her hood or dust-
ing her kirtle or more like she is swooned
with happiness said jones on palmer
himself remarking that ralph was some-
what long gone

    nay tell the truth as it is said ger-
row the maid is not over-raptured with
lambardiston    and deuce take me
he added with his spleen coming to the
surface i can not tell why we stay to see
the meeting of the child and the gentle-
man

  there was a considerable sneer about
the last word which whipped my atten-
tion pretty smartly from the stairs i
faced round and was on the point of re-
torting hotly when i was diverted by the
casting open of a door beside us three
of my train-bandmen stepped forth from
a room they saluted us and two of
them marched off the third a sergeant
paused to shut the door

   nay leave it said jones we get
some daylight thus    faith he con-
tinued as the sergeant went away how
queerly dark it hath grown in this last
minute a storm is on us

      tis the suddenest thing said ger-
row with astonishment he lifted his
cane towards the barred aperture above
the main door not a minute ago the
sky yonder was fresh blue palmer i was
looking at it see it now the smokiest
brown i ever beheld-he broke off with
an extraordinary gulp flicking down his
cane and jabbing the end hard upon the
paved floor-i-ever-beheld he re-
peated sheer amazement in his voice

years ago when i stood in this very pas-

there was near to have been for her daugh-
ter in this hour-and that up above too
for there would have been dangerous
trouble in the market-place had she gone
thither list you can hear the tumult
from it so we heard it then-and
through this doorway-

  gerrow moved athwart the rooms
doorway and instantly his spare elderly
face was illumined by a sickly yellow
light which showed him staring with
something akin to fear with his lips work-
ing

   yea there it is he cried pointing
shakily through the doorway there is
the selfsame sky that was over us

vt ow having been preoccupied by
ll noras tardiness i had not noticed
the change to gloom until jones spoke of
it in my surprize at perceiving how deep
an obscurity was about us save in the yel-
low lights path i straightway forgot my
anger against gerrow and listening
while he spoke of that other morning i
found myself remembering much that my
father had said anent their standing in
this passage and when the dull yel-
low glow swam over gerrows face i re-
called vividly indeed how my father had
spoken of the yellow light pouring
through this very doorway-and in an in-
stant for no reason that i knew of i felt
my heart cold and heavy

  i went to gerrows side and glanced
through the doorway to the window be-
yond and at that verily i got a shock

the sky was the sky of the morning when
mrs shafto was hanged it was that
same november sky-not a similitude
made by the overcasting of the july sky
for the sun seemingly had fallen back
from the height whence it shone as i
walked to the jail and was little risen
and it shone feebly through a gap molten
in the thick murk-just as it had when i
looked on it from the red bull in my
boyhood its turbid light then had ren-
dered airs shaftos coming death increas-
edly dreadful to me but now ere i had
gazed on it five seconds there slid over
me a horror-on this morning when no
execution was to be done-a hundred-
fold worse than that which cjualmed me
when execution really was to be

   gerrow i breathed and i looked at
him

  he was gripping his chin tightly
his eyes were expanding vacant his
mien was that of one dismayed to stupe-
faction by something he has discovered

     tis thirteen years ago he said
slurredly for his grip was hampering his
mouth this day is thirteen years ago-
we are in november     how can it
be

    gerrow i cried

  his vacant eyes sought me a startled
glitter sprang up in them he gaped
taking his hand from his chin and holding
it limp-fingered towards me

   lambardiston he said how like to
your father you are why-why you are
he harry-harry lambardiston old
friend

  his hand dropped in affection on my
shoulder i clasped his arm to push it
away but i heard jones speak to palmer
and his words arrested me in the act

   palmer he quoth heavily my dear
cousin ned olpherts is dead at last of
the wounds the french gave him at mar-
tinique
weird tales



  well did i know that jones cousin
olphert lingering with wounds received
when fighting under admiral harman at
martinique had died in november 

  palmer replied not except to mumble
of the fort at tangier and of the moor-
men-seeming to believe himself in afri-
ca where once he had served

  and then from the clockhouse began
to ring forth the hour of nine

  i clutched hard on gerrows arm for
though the sounds were not very near us
each stroke seemed to club my senses and
what with the horrid yellow light i was
become giddy-helplessly giddy and
bemused too was i in the strangest fash-
ion during a space for having reeled
against a wall pulling gerrow with me
i leaned there thinking that my weakness
and unaccountable dread were disgraceful
to me who had gained such a repute for
stout courage at the fight on long mar-
ston moor and full a minute must have
passed ere i remembered that it was my
father who fought at long marston-six
years before i was born

  i thrust gerrows arm from me still
leaning i noted that the others stood very
quiet their faces set in a wholly bewild-
ered expression yet their eyes restless in
a lethargic manner dwelling now on
mine now on each others

ft or a space we stayed thus without a
-- word each man i should say striv-
ing to adjust the disorder which he knew
his thoughts were in and wondering if all
were as distraught as he

  then we were aroused-even as i per-
ceived that the yellowness was going from
the light and the passage brightening
somewhat-by a footfall on the stone
stairs

  ralph timmins was descending alone
he came from step to step slowly and
despite the gloom that remained and his

weird tales

distance from me i saw that there was
yet in his face a far greater confusion than
had ever been in my companions con-
fusion-it was the completest astound-
ment save that his pale blue eyes were
wide open as though from some waxing
torment of his mind he was in a stupor
he seemed a man midway between a
dream that was terrible and an awakening
that was more terrible above his
streaked beard his cheeks were marble-
white

  slowly he moved down at the last
step he tripped nearly pitching on his
head

  it was then that gerrows voice rose
in a very wail oh see that he cried
what means it what witchs craft is
on us

   i had seen with my fathers saying of
how ralph timmins had stumbled at the
bottom step darting like a sword-blade
through my brain that stumble and
gerrows final words discovered the
truth to me

   knew-ay i knew what timmins
coming drag-foot straight to me with his
eyes now on my face desperately ques-
tioning me was going to say i knewi
my poor wondrous little nora who
deemed she had witchs craft enough to
keep herself from me how supremely
had she wrought with her magic

  timmins stopped and saluted me

    sir he said i have put the young
witch away as your worship bid

  knowing i had waited petrified but
his words stung me to life-to madness
i shrieked twice or thrice making the pas-
sage echo-timmins crouching and wilt-
ing before me with both hands i seized
his neckcloth tearing it off him as i strove
to smash him against the wall i struck
him oa the face i wrung out my sword
cursing him promising him every agony

that man can inflict on man then-i
can not tell why save that i was bereft of
reason-i shouted

   bring her go bring her down to
me-menacing him with my point

  he moved his hands hopelessly

    your worship she is dead

    bring her i screamed

  he turned and went to the stairs he
mounted and was gone behind their bend
and once more i was watching those emp-
ty stone stairs i felt a hand patting my
arm twas jones for gerrow some way
behind me was saying look blue sky
and clear sunlight    man open that
door i am nigh swooning and the main
door grated open which would be done
by palmers hand

   i took not my eyes from the stairs i
listened strainedly and at last the sound
of slow steps the steps of someone de-
scending sideways with a burden came to
me from beyond the bend and then ap-
peared noras little feet in their gray hose
-extended in the air the shoon fallen
off i saw her kirtle edge i saw her
knees swathed in her kirtle half arched
upon timmins arm in another second
i should have seen her face but i could
not endure that much i leapt round with
fresh and frantic screams and ran out to
my coach

   old jem put his hand over his eyes re-
maining very still for a while

   after the rain yesterday he said his
voice gone wan and low i went walk-
ing and came home by the horse-pool i
halted in the lane thinking much on
nora this is december month but
twas may to me in the lane and how
clear i could see nora with her sweet
angered face her poor little basket of
flower roots-and her old knife which i
would with all my heart she had drove
weird tales



 through and through me    nora dead
 these six-and-fifty years

   he flung down his hand raising his
 chin

    there then said he is my answer to
 you gentlemen who are so mighty scorn-
 ful of witchcraft why nora changed
 not into a bird or moth to escape me why
 she spelled me not blind or cripple i can
 not say but in what she did showed
 she not the supremest witchcraft that
 could be she changed the sky she threw
 back the year to thirteen years before
 and while we in the passage were but half
 under her magic which was enough for
 her she so spellbound ralph timmins
 and drew the turnkey that without ado
 they hanged her from the beam in the
 cell believing they were hanging her
 mother  i made no endeavor after-
 wards to punish these fellows think you
 i would have spared them if the circum-
 stances were not as i have told you

 of the listeners it was the parson who
 spoke the hints of great sorrow
 which had come from old jem had not
 been without effect on him so that
 hateful though the picture of his host in
 early manhood was he was no longer
 void of pity

   mr lambardiston he said and his
 tones were gentle i hold your story of
 this awful happening to be true in every
 word-so far as that happening was un-
 derstood by you and others but i deem
 you have erred as to the real nature of it
  i can not believe it was any witch-
 craft of nora shafto that took her from
 you

   could aught save witchcraft have
 done it exclaimed old jem with rising
 anger

   yes answered the parson for a
 moment he was silent then

weird tales
suggestions as to stories for the

weird story reprint section have been
pouring in lately most of the requests
are for the reprint of stories from old issues
of weird tales which is now completing
its twelfth year we will give careful con-
sideration to these requests as far as we can
keeping always before us the desires of the
greatest number it is because of numerous
requests that we are reprinting in this issue
the supreme witch by the late g appleby
terrill and next month we will reprint
another favorite that strange ghost story by
the late henry s whitehead the fire-
place which was very popular when it was
first published in our pages ten years ago

best stories of 

  julius hopkins of washington d c
writes to the eyrie the november wt is
an excellent issue and i thoroughly enjoyed
every story in it however two stories stand
out in my mind as the best ones in this
issue i pick for first place the last part of
the people of the black circle because of
its very exciting and fast-moving conclusion
the second-best story in my estimation is
the golden glow when one considers the
possibilities of such rays as are used by the
professor in this story he will find that it
may not be long before such things will be
in actual use my selections of the twelve
best stories in wt during  judging by
their uniqueness and originality are as fol-
lows the solitary hunters black thirst
vatnpires of the moon scarlet dream the
satanic piano the colossus of ylourgne
they called him ghost the isle of dark
magic the three marked pennies the peo-
ple of the black circle the black gods
kiss and - guessing on this one - black
gods shadow

     

against serial stories

 w c murray of fort warren wyo-
ming writes to the eyrie i have been read-
ing weird tales magazine since january
 when i bought my first copy i have
not missed a copy since i thought queen of
the lilin in the november issue exception-
ally good let us keep our magazine weird
how about more horror tales such as the
copper bowl by george fielding eliot and
the coffin of lissa by august derleth i
would very much like to read the coffin of
lissa again in the wt reprint    heres
to more short stories no serials and more
vampire and horror and torture tales

a suggested reprint

  alonzo leonard of portsmouth ohio
writes for those readers who so tumultu-
ously clamor for interplanetary thrillers
under the delusion that they are weird stories
i suggest that you republish frank belknap
longs supreme story the devil-god which
appeared in june  nuff sed

gripped in suspense

  claude h cameron of toronto writes
c l moore again scores with the black
gods kiss it is   a superb piece of
workmanship and it held me gripped in sus-
pense until i finished it that is sufficient
the character of jirel may become as famous
to us as conan i vote her first place stories
like the pistol i like because they are some-
what believable gurwit is excellent at any
time h bedford-jones the sleeper was
written in the proper vein with just the
right amount of allusion i detest weird
stories whose very weirdness is removed by
laborious explanations of intent your read-
ers are not morons as has often been stated
by your readers the truly desirable weird
weird tales



tale is weird by virtue of what is suggested
howards the people of the black circle is
very good i will remember it for some time
to come  in the november wt there
is no question but that s gordon gurwit
wins first place for the golden glow i do
not favor too many interplanetary yarns or
science stories in weird tales but gur-
wits story was so well thought out and so
perfectly written that i can not avoid giving
him first place second comes paul ernst-
concert to death sufficient to say that i be-
lieve the story will outlive the author how-
ards story the people of the black circle
had a very satisfactory conclusion i vote it
as a suitable companion piece to jack wil-
liamsons recent masterpiece all in all the
november issue is well up to the top in the
usual high standard i have come to expect
now for something in a different vein-
somehow prices yarn oueen of the lilin
left me cold the idea and entire plot is
threadbare from use furthermore it wasnt
as smooth a job as i had grown accustomed
to expect from this master craftsman   
gurwits story far outshadows prices yarn
any way i look at them nude with a dag-
ger also falls into the class of the stale plot

the golden glow

  jade darrow of chicago writes to the
eyrie for first place in the november
issue my choice goes without a doubt to the
golden glow by s gordon gurwit i like
the authors style i got a big kick out of the
fact that the warring nations could do noth-
ing at all except swallow their pride and
give in e hoffmann price with his queen
of the lilin was very entertaining i am glad
that price h writing more often than he used
to the cover by m brundage is a nice piece
of work but there is nothing weird about it
keep the covers weird    the people of
the black circle ended well the shortest
tale john flanders nude with a dagger
was a peach lets hear more from him

the prophets beard

  fred anger of berkeley california
writes to the eyrie by the beard of the
prophet several things concerning the
november issue have aroused my ire and
several others have done just the opposite
queen of the lilin surpasses all the others by
its sheer beauty it certainly takes e hoff-

weird tales

mann price to write weird literature i hope
that you intend to print a great deal more of
his work s gordon gurwit was rather dis-
appointing his story the golden glow
failed to register perhaps it is my dwarfed
mentality but it seems to me that this story
was only the general run of death-ray world-
saver tales robert e howard brought his
serial the people of the black circle to a
very nice close it takes second place on my
voting list a--d speaking of robert e
howard reminds me of our friend conan
robert blochs nasty crack about our blood-
thirsty hero has certainly started something
fot die past day the grindstones of anger-
ville have been whetting my ax and i am
now ready to charge into the fray waving
the banner of conan the cimmerian i used
to consider conan a vile and despicable hero
but i have changed and he is now foremost
in my estimation as a hero bring on your
tale by bloch the secret in the tomb and
ill cut it to the ground paul ernst and kirk
mashbum seem to leave a blank space in-
deed so boring did i find voodoo ven-
geance that i lapsed into peaceful slumber
while reading it next let us turn to that
small but nevertheless immense atrocity
peigmans beard by august w derleth call
it hexerei call it witchcraft of anything you
please but it was rank ditto only more
vehemently to nude with a dagger to

it ye loyal conan supporters a story by
robert bloch appears in this issue the
secret in the tomb will be published later-

better to my satisfaction a number of years
ago i read a story in your magazine that i
must say was one of the best stories i have
ever read the kind that makes the chills run

the year and month i do not remember but
the title of the story i think is fungus isle

i	would appreciate your giving it to us again

far asunder from witchcraft the su-
preme power which stayed the sun upon
gibeon and the moon in the valley of
ajalon which thrust back the shadow on
the sun-dial could with equal ease have
transmuted the years for you that were in
the jail-decreeing that thus should nora
who for all her childish vauntings of
witchcraft was truly white-souled as an
angel- the speaker paused de-
creeing that thus should nora go to her
mother he ended mercifully

  for the color had ebbed from old
jems cheeks the very purple of his lips
was mud-hue and consternation and
growing despair were in his face

  i had not thought of that said the
old man whisperingly if that should
be the right answer to all of it parson
then a new expression crossed his face
and during an instant his voice was firm-
er for noras sake i hope it is for
that means heaven for her   but if it is
the answer parson-what is going to be-
come of me

  i believe such things as that hope for
noras sake do make some little pica for

us said the parson quietly also-

  the courtly kings messenger nudged
the scrivener with his knee the two got
up and lit their pipes at the far end of the
room noting that the parson left his chair
and took one beside old jem

  and not until they perceived these two
clinch some matter with a long handclasp
did the smokers go back to the table
