an answer to critics

by cotthard cunther

  dear editor my seetee mind has obvi-
ously antagonized a great many people the
summer issue of startling carried the let-
ters of alastair cameron and martin brilliant
the fall edition prints similar attacks by
donald susan and joe gibson it seems to
nie that al my critics-together with several
other letter writers who communicated with
me directly-should have curbed their impa-
tience a bit this is a series of four  ar-
ticles and my concept of seetee mentality
cannot be wholly clear till the last piec of
the series the thought-translator is pub-
lished

  if you take a course in the art of writing
one of the first things you are told is if your
subject-matter is complicated say one thing
at a time never try to say several things
at once i followed this rule when i wrote
the seetee mind i explained one relevant
item about seetee mentality in the first article
namely its reversed character of consciousness
i did not mention another equally relevant
fact this is what my critics seem to miss

  let me quote gibson referring to indi-
viduals with seetee consciousness he says

they could be just as blindly aristotelian as
we are in our own world with its non-aristo-
telian factors    their greeij wouldnt be
purple or anything else it would be just as
green as our green their whiskey would
taste the same to them as ours tastes to us
i completely agree with gibson their green
would be green to them and their whiskey
would taste like whiskey to them    but not
to us and this not to us is the essential
point

  in my first article i pointed out one and
only one thing the difference between the
terrene mind and a contra-tcrrene mentality
the last article of the series will bring out the
opposite point the hermeneutic identity of
the aristotelian and the contra-aristotelian
mentality how is that possible well let me
explain the whole problem by dint of a very
simple analogy take any piece of writing
and read it it conveys some definite meaning
now take the same writing hold it against a
mirror and try to read it in the reflection
the ductus of the letters and their sequence
is now reversed however it goes without
saying that the meaning conveyed by the text
in its reflected form is still the same even if
we have difficulty in deciphering it-or cant
read it at all but although the meaning of
the text is identically the same the picture of
the text looks to us now very different how-
ever the letters would have their old familiar
configuration if they were looked at by lewis
carrolls alice - after she had stepped
through the looking-glass an l for
instance would appear to us in the mirror
as il but to alice it would still appear as
an l now let us assume that we want to
read alices writing but that we do not know
how to decipher the reversed form of the text
the solution is very simple we take a second
mirror and read alices text in it the second
mirror reverses the ductus of the text again
the  j of what we recognize as alices text
would again appear to us as an ordinary l

the second mirror plays so to speak the
part of a thoueht-translator our text and
the text of alice say exactly the tame but
we cannot read understand it in its reversed
turn to page

form we have to re-reverse it

  i hope this illustration-which of course
oversimplifies the problem-brings home to my
readers the insight that a seetee mind might
think exactly the same as our terrene mind-
but there is a gap of understanding and com-
munication just the same consequently joe
gibson is wrong when he assumes that accord-
ing to my theory the seetee mind is non-aris-
totelian gibson confuses non-aristotelian
with coatra-aristotelian it is a crass mis-
understanding of the whole problem to assume
that the seetee mind could be non-aristotelian
a contra-terrene mentality could only he con-
tra-aristotelian in other words such mind
would be for itself precisely aristotelian but
for vs ie the terrene consciousness it
would appear in reverse like reflected in a
mirror and we would therefore call it contra-
aristotelian

  the concept of non-aristotelianism comes
in only if we develop a logic which tries to
bridge the gap between the two aristotelian
varieties of pure thought such a logic would
be basicallv a robot-logic-as is own in my

of the woods yet were still getting mail

liked spaceman lost

by edward e smith

  dear editor have just finished reading
gos spacemen lost

  that my friend is science fiction-
one of the finest things you or anybody else
ever published-des plaines illinois

  coming from the creator of kimball
kinnison thats high praise and to spare
our blushes were not printing the even
more glowing letter you wrote to george
o smith the happy author but enough
of praise and back to controversy with   

hes for religion

by lowell kennedy

  dear editor  at last you have a new mem-
ber in the fan mail club and ive had a
terrible time in getting this letter written
every time i would think about it and look
at my typewriter id get typewriter probia
but i fooled it this time i snuck up on it
before it had time to cast its spell on me

  im in the process of reading startling
stories so far its tops simple psiman
was very interesting i usually read the short
stories first but i simply have to write this
letter before i finish it and since you are
going to put this letter into print ill get to

the point the main object or if you prefer the

core of this letter

   read the letter section of startling
right off the bat and i came across a very
interesting letter located on page  first
column i agree with the writer on three
things i am also an stf fan in part with
what he says and that religion is a legitimate
subject for discussion i would like to further
his attempt for laughs and promote satis-
factorily uproarious dissensions so im going
to take issue with what he said im in the
process of studying theology so whether or
not im qualified to do so here goes

  second paragraph    agreed the fourth
paragraph is the first one that i take issue
with he says he hasnt the slightest idea
whether or not there is any validity in any of
the religions there is no validity in any ex-
cept the one as put forth in the bible no
no no im not preaching im merely stating
what i believe proof i uggest a study of
history to begin with actually its very diffi-
cult to prove thats where the importance of
believing comes in what has convinced me
of it is this observation of conditions of the
world from the beginning of history to the
present corruption of the world scientists
have been able to explain many things to us
but after they go back so far they are not able
to explain the cause of the cause of the cause
just looking at plants people animals the
universe   that these things could have just
happened is pure nonsense

  the writer says that religion is a harmful
social force religion has been the cause
of wars and political upheavals or i should
say that religion was the catalyst not that
it was the fault of religion but mans mad
jealousy of religions power over other men
or the misuse of this power and ill admit
that it has retarded scientific advancement to
some extent but thats only because of
peoples foolish notion that you cant mix
science with religion my friends tell me the
same thing you better not mess with sci-
ence you might lose your faith while actu-
ally true science nowhere contradicts the
bible god put science here for man to ex-
plore and to use it to make a more comfortable
world to live in one proves the other how-
ever i think that people are gradually growing
up to the fact that religion and science can
exist side by side in perfect harmony

  that the will and the intellect and the con-
science lose their strength when yon prop them
with something is true in some cases and
therefore he concludes that one becomes that
much less able to solve a problem or even to
consider one obviously however he is re-
ferring to religion and i refer to the one
in the bible as the prop which removes that
feeling of shame and makes one less able to
solve a problem not so a person with
a guilty conscience is less able to solve a prob-

they came to the hostile frozen moon of jupiter to

tackle an engineering problem-and ran into a political puzzle

a novel by poul anderson

 three dead men walked across the face
 of hell their feet groped past frozen rock
 now and then they stumbltd in the wan light
 and always they heard the thin bitter mumble
 of wind and felt the cold gnawing at their flesh
 around them there was death naked stone
 reaching for a cruel sky of stars a lean poison-
 ous whirl of snow which was not snow that
 whipped about them and then lay still to crunch
 under their tread jupiter was low in the south
 a great shield which glowed amber

   they had been walking for a long time now
 it seemed like forever and ahead of them was
 nothing but another endlessness of walking
 speech had died within them their feet were
 numbed clods which rose and struck the ground
 and rose again there was so little awareness
	startling stories

left that they did not feel the small jar-
ring of their boots against rock and
snow it was very quiet

  hall davenant wondered dimly if he
had not always been walking from noth-
ing to nowhere across the snows of
ganymede with jupiter enormous 
the horizon and the stars cold overhead
he wondered if he had not dreamed all
his past if earth and luna and man-
kind were not the fleeting vision of the
only life in the world as it stumbled mad
through desolation

  yamagata spoke after so long a si-
lence it was a shock to hear his remote
toneless voice were not going to
make it

  there was another stillness while
kruse found words then doesnt
look like it but theres no point in sit-
ting and waiting

  pick-up-your-right-foot - glide -
down  pick-up-your-right-foot - glide
down

  not the way were going we wont
said yamagata one gauntleted hand
jerked toward the gauges on his shoul-
der look oxygen for barely two
hours more juice for maybe three but
its no use staying warm if you cant
breathe

  oh well said kruse we werent
going anywhere anyway

  pick-up-your-right-foot - glide -
down

  there was a time several thousand
years ago it seemed when davenant
could not have listened to them talking
thus without a shiver in his guts but
cold and hunger and weariness had
dragged at him so long that it didnt
make any difference now

  his companions looked blocky and in-
human in their hclmcted suits it was as
if they were demons leading him into
darkness but it didnt matter now

dreamily davenant considered
all the hope and strength which had
once laid within him he had meant to
be a soldier in mans finest war the fight
of all men against a blind and indifferent
nature which had brought their kind

forth without caring but she was too
strong he thought vaguely one casual
giant shrug of a planets shoulders and
her parricide children were tumbled into
ruin

  no-it wasnt the way an engineer
ought to be thinking he told himself
even at the gates of death there should
still be pride but ganymede had
stripped it from him until he was noth-
ing but a blindness lurching it knew not
where

  yamagata continued almost absent-
mindedly we might be headed in
more or less the correct direction we
might get a decent reception if and when
we arrive

  or we might get shot down said
kruse forget it

  they may be just beyond the next
hill said yamagata or they may be
-shall we say-three hours off and
we have oxygen for two hours

  pick- u p-y our- left- foot-gl i de-down

  now our information is a good deal
more important than any one of us
went on yamagata the abbey has
got to know all right i have an idea

  kruse slipped on a sheet of ice he
caught himself wearily his fall was
slow and he got up without bothering
to curse

  torvald you have people at home
dont you asked yamagata

  ych said kruse parents couple
of sisters and there was a girl who-
never mind

  how about you hall

  not to speak of said davenant
mechanically

  nor i and youre younger wait a
minute yamagata stopped the others
went on for several long low-gravity
paces before their slowed brains brought
them around again

  yamagatas face was like wrinkled
yellow cloth in the pouring jupiter-light
it had a little smile as he peered through
his face-plate theyll stick mv name in
heros hall or some such foolishness
he said what i wish youd do if you
live is drink a beer for me at the beacon
in luna city
the snows of ganymede	

  wait a minute- kruse took a step
toward him but was too late yamagata
had already turned off his oxygen valves
now quite simply he fumbled at some
screws and lifted his helmet

   moist air within rushed out in a freez-
ing cloud blood bubbled on his lips ran
from his nose and ears as pressure
dropped and congealed he swayed for
a long time before toppling

  the face under its sudden mask of
ice was puffed and distorted beyond hu-
manness kruse stooped over even
through the bulky suit he could be seen
to shake

  he shouldnt have done that he
mumbled he shouldnt have done it
the wind slipped under his voice a
ghostly whistle

   davenant felt ill but his training rose
within him this was part of what it
meant to be an engineer at the very
least yamagata had returned that
knowledge to him

  he gave us each-an hours oxy-
gen he said

  yeh i wish he hadnt

  somebody has to make it if thats
possible at all davenant felt tears on
his cheeks were wasting time stand-
ing here

  i-suppose so kid

  kruse turned the body around and un-
clipped the bottles and accumulators
then he laid yamagata out-the arms
were not yet too rigid for him to fold the
hands across the breast but he couldnt
close the bulged-out eyes there was
nothing else to do rising he helped
davenant fasten on ihe new equipment
lets go he said

  they went around a high dark bluff
and the bodv was lost to sight

  after another while davenant said
i wonder if we shouldnt do the same
one survivor is better than none we
could match for it

  no said kruse thats cutting
our number too low come on

  davenant shook his head as if he had
been struck but the shock had given
him back his manhood as he walked
he could even remember and he tried to

sort out how it had begun take it fro
the beginning back at the abbey-

een from outside in the harsk
bright flare of sunlight or the deep soli
blue which poured from earth the ab-
bey was a fantastic witches castle
perched on the cruel heights of archt-
medes crater like the nest of some in-
human robber baron it was built of
native stone great rough-hewn blocks
forming towers and walls of immense
thickness all of it had a purpose aimed
at the future-spires for observation and
testing walls and roofs to shut out raw
vacuum but in appearance it was still
archaic it looked as if it had always
been on the moon

  there was a road winding up to it
and a landing field for local rockets
further back was a spaceport where the
shining ships were like spears poised at
heaven there were also guns and
arsenals and launching racks for guided
missiles but they were hidden and noth-
ing was said about them they had been
stocked against a day of trouble which
might or might not come

  inside there was an endlessness of
rooms and passages burrowing deep in-
to the ground or climbing to the highest
towers some of these were for mainte-
nance-food water air power in case
of need the place could be made self-
sufficient others were storerooms still
others were laboratories where testing
and research never ended the rest were
sleeping chambers refectories assembly
and recreation centers

  there was always sound here-the
whisper of ventilators and engines foot-
falls talk music

  this was archimedes academy head-
quarters and training school of the order
of planetary engineers few called it
anything but the abbev

  hall davenant walked down a corri-
dor it was of dressed stone high and
	startling stories

vaulted the tapestries and murals and
fluorotubes never quite lifting its cool
gloom he walked fast and crisply his
boots slamming in pride on the flagging
his gray tunic and trousers forced into a
painful neatness that was the dress
uniform of field service

  his shoulders bore the silver comets
of tech- rank and on his breast was
the helium-atom insignia which said his
specialty was nucleonics he was a
young man with a young mans open-
ness in his rather long face blue eyes
yellow hair close-cropped in the ap-
proved engineer style

  he passed a couple of cadets teen-
aged boys who saluted him with bone-
cracking smartness he responded
thinking that cadets were a nuisance al-
ways going through the rituals for of
course seniors had to conform before
them that was part of the training it
did not occur to him that he had grad-
uated only three years previously

  further on he met an elderly labman
in the loose robe and short beard affected
by that service this one had the gaunt
deep-burned features of a man who had
been in field in his younger days and
retired to the abbey-teaching research
administration-when his body could no
longer take deep space he stopped
davenant who knew him slightly hear
youre going to jupiter he said

  well-yes survey onlv this trip
 know just wanted to ask you to
pick me up some samples of green cal-
listite ive used up all we had and want
to run some more tests on it damnedest
stuff i ever saw

  different geology different minerals
within limits davenant said tritely

  i know and you tell me how were
going to sink shafts fifty kilometers deep
without knowing the properties of the
strata i lost two months work on mars
once because we didnt know just how
friable the sandstone around thor was
for gods sake spend a little time with
a sonic probe before drawing up your
specs

  certainly

  davenant got away as fast as he de-

cently could after seven years of train-
ing he thought and three of field serv-
ice-venus and the belt-he ought to
know the elements of his trade

  still space was big and other planets
could be unearthly in startling and dead-
ly ways you were never sure an en-
gineer always walked with his life in his
hands the labs were there to give him
as firm a grip as possible but even so the
tablets in heros hall were getting over-
ly numerous

tte came to the office he wanted and
pushed the scanner button the man
inside lyell saw his face and punched
to open the door for him he entered
came to attention and saluted lyell
was his new captain and some of them
stood on ceremony even among seniors

  the lean gray man waved him negli-
gently to a chair the office was fur-
nished as austerely as most of the aca-
demy that had a definite purpose like
everything else it kept the men used to
discomfort of which deep space had
plenty field men did not marry if they
wanted to stay in that branch they
lived at the abbey and their sprees
when on leave were carried out incog
eventually of course most who sur-
vived would acquire wives then they
got apartments in the underground vil-
lage at the foot of the castle became
labmen or technies perhaps at last made
the council

  lyell was old to be a spacer

  few engineers ever left the order
their seven years as cadets included
mind training under some of the most
skilled psychotechnicians in the solar
system and when thev were through
the order and its esprit de corps were
part of them

  davenant looked around everybody
else seemed to be there akihito yama-
gata small and quiet geologist torvald
kruse big and red-haired and cheerful
the son of a rancher on venus heavy
construction rene falkenhorst from
mars tall and slender and dark me-
chanical engineer yuan li a trifle on
the portly side always smiling just a
the snows of ganymede	

bit biological engineer davenant him-
self was atomics expert and arthur
lyell stiff and gray with enough all-
around experience to qualify him for
chief

  the men sat before the captains desk
not speaking spacers learned to con-
serve talk lest they exhaust the supply
on a long tour of duty there was a
haze of smoke in the air from cigarettes
and pipes

  i wanted to have a short conference
with you said lycll his eyes went
around their circle youll be in centri-
fuge and so forth from now on until we
leave and once in space well be busy
enough studying up technical details as
you know were off to the jovian sys-
tem on preliminary survey the jovians
want us to terraform ganymede and
callisto-a big job since the survey alone
may well take a year not many com-
forts of home out there i suppose youre
all willing to go 

  of course said davenant and felt
rather juvenile for having spoken

  not much is known about the jovian
system or its settlers went on lyell
im having the library stat copies of
what books and articles we have the
moons seem to be poor in natural re-
sorces so one thing well have to keep an
eye out for is means of payment

  he must have noticed davenants faint
shock for he smiled and explained
yes i know that sounds contrary to
the spirit of the charter the planetary
engineers exist to make space available
for all men regardless of race creed or
political affiliations nevertheless ever
since the order broke away from being a
branch of the union government and
became an independent organization its
had to pav its own way

  so far its done well were by far
the wealthiest and most influential pri-
vate organization in the system but a
whole job of planetarv transformation
is so costly that we cant go into the red
the jovians arc poor in fissionablcs and
will probably be unwilling to part with
any so well look for other resources in
fact we may have to set up some indus-

tries for them to make things we can use
to pay the order bear that in mind

  we always need small spaceships
and machinery replacements said
falkenhorst they should be able to
make those

  its a thought said lyell but
what i most wanted to emphasize was
this you know the order is strictly non-
political events have justified us dur-
ing the late humanist revolution for
instance we were the only major group
left undisturbed wc put loose from the
government because we foresaw trouble
coming well it came and it is still go-
ing on and things are going to get worse
before they get better if the order is to
survive the anti-scientific reaction build-
ing up  earth it will have to stick by
its policy

  that isnt going to be easy jupiter
as the only state outside the union is
distrusted on the inner planets and
people wont thank us for building up
their potentials the jovians wont like
us either since we are inner planetar-
ians and from what little is known
jovian society is such a turbulent mess
that well doubtless be pulled twenty
ways at once by as many conflicting
power groups

  but no matter what the provocation
remember your training and the rules
even if i should die and leave vou on
your own the planetary engineers
exist to serve all mankind sometimes
that sounds vapidly idealistic but its the
only way we can preserve our identity
and privileges the only wav we can
weather the storm that is coming the
medieval church was another suprana-
tional organization tts attempts to in-
terfere with separate states led only to
trouble and ultimate failure but in its
character as the friend of all mankind it
was honored and powerful when that
power began to be used for personal and
local ends the church broke up its an
example we might all bear in mind

  he grinned and turned to a thick sheaf
of papers on his desk

  all right gentlemen lectures over
now lets get down to particulars
	startling stories

iii

   mruring tlie lunatic years of the
latter twentieth century the white
american church arose and became pop-
ular in the southern states of the old
usa like the contemporaneous pil-
grims it represented reaction-partly
against the troubles which preceded ac-
companied and followed world war
iii partly against the spreading of
scientific method in human relations
which those same troubles forced as the
only solution unlike the pilgrim
church the white church method was
not an attempt to return to a fancied
norm but an eccentric leap toward an
imaginary millennium it was not elab-
orately rationalized but violently anti-
intellectual  it was not austere but
given to curious orgiastic rites

  some local politicians encouraged it
so as to gain an organized reliable vot-
ing body and eventually it dominated
many communities its intellectual isola-
tionism caused it to go to yet further ex-
tremes especially against the concept of
equal rights for all races and the widen-
ing public appreciation of rational
scientific thought however as it grew
in wealth to become of some importance
it necessarily acquired an intelligentsia
and a systematized philosophy

  the increasingly effective program
of undermining anti-rational organiza-
tions and beliefs which was an impor-
tant feature of the socalled new en-
lightenment eventually began to shrink
its membership the second conference
of rio had also made it obvious that be-
fore long the limited world government
of the un would be superseded by the
complete federalism of the solar union
which the white american doctrine con-
sidered intolerable

  imitating the earlier pilgrim exodus
to mars the church decided to found a
colony on ganymede the jovian system
being chosen for its remoteness and the
general lack of competitive interest in
settling it a large ecological-unit space-
ship the american was built and a
number of smaller ones obtained the

scheme was that some thousands of
members would go out to start the
colony while the rest stayed at home and
worked to finance the project

  in a decade or so of heroic effort the
city of x was firmly established thus
named to suggest the mysterious char-
acter of divinity and its dwelling but
meanwhile the financial drain had proved
too great for the mother church a
membership which had hitherto been
loyal broke away in large part because it
was being impoverished by demands for
money psychodynamic technicians of
the government were adroit in using the
discontent as a wedge for propaganda
by twenty-one hundred ad the jovian
colonists found themselves without a
sponsor no ties to earth almost com-
pletely cut off by the expense of travel
to their system

  they sent occasional observers and
representatives to earth but there was
no union governor over them since they
seemed neither to need nor want one
occasional reports about them still come
in rumoring the evolution of a strange
and ruthless culture which through a
series of revelations has been changed
far from the original concept

  but on the whole the jovians have
remained an isolated and unknown tribe
their declaration of independence while
the union was confused bv the human-
ist revolt on earth and their persistent
refusal to rejoin merely emphasizes
their already accomplished secession
from the rest of the human race

tavenant switched off the micro-
u projector that had been screening
de la gardes short history oj inter-
planetary colonisation he sighed he
could have gone into more detail

  he wasnt interested said ealken-
horst he deals with what he considers
the main line of history the inner
planets elsewhere he gives an economic
analysis to show that nothing beyond the
belt will ever be important-not enough
resources too hard to colonize the prob-
lem of survival wont leave any surplus
energy
the snows of ganymede



   as a matter of fact said lyell the
 colony wouldnt have been possible at all
 it the american government hadnt
 quietly subsidized it-by such indirect
 means that the church itself never knew
 about it the psychotechs foresaw that
 the attempt would exhaust and break up
 the organization on earth ive seen
 secret records that the humanists made
 public

   they really did get machiavellian
 back in those days didnt they mur-
 mured yuan but seriously there must
 be more information on jupiter than
 this

   of course said lyell plenty of it
 but nothing coherent part of our task
 will be to get the whole picture as it is
 today so you boys at least may as well
 start without preconceptions

   he took out a curved pipe and began
 loading it yes theres scattered in-
 formation but what nobody knows yet
 is the total cultural pattern just remem-
 ber that man necessarily develops a dif-
 ferent civilization in every environment
 if he stays long enough and that what
 may shock you is normal perhaps neces-
 sary on ganymede also-the order
 stays out of politics

   davenant reflected on what he had
 seen and heard he had been on earth
 but little even though the engineers did
 some work there their main interest
 was space the planet of his birth had
 become a stranger to him

   but he knew the hectic commerce and
 gaiety which was luna city knew the
 stiff dignity the high sense of order and
 discipline respect for intellectual achi-
 evement that characterized mars was
 familiar with the patriarchal somewhat
 violent clan life which was developing on
 venus since the invention of the cheap
 mobile reclamation unit

   but ganymede would not be like any-
 thing he knew

tthe ship let there be light
hummed and murmured stars
blazed against blackness in the vision

davenant examined
the weapon


startling stories

ports she was a cruiser one of the new
models which could accelerate most of
the way and reach even jupiter in a
couple of weeks

  there were only the six of them
aboard with a full cargo of equipment
and supplies that was not cutting it as
fine as an ordinary spaceman would
think even though only lyell and
davenant had the full specialized knowl-
edge required for a certificate any engi-
neer could operate a spaceship alone if
it had not been too drastically damaged

  lyell puffed smoke and squinted
through a mesh of crows-feet

  one more thing might need emphas-
izing he said well be there for a
year i imagine and youll want recrea-
tion from time to time im afraid youll
have to do without it one of the psy-
chological mainstays of the orders pow-
er is the impression of lawfulness and
restraint its men give

  we know that boss said kruse
looking hurt

  yes of course still on an inner-
planet job a man does get leaves he
knows what amusements accord with
local customs and he goes incog any-
way none of that will be true on gany-
mede i doubt if they have red lights of
any sort for instance and no disguise
will be good enough in so small a com-
mune on a planet where hedonism was
considered normal where everyone was
expected as a matter of morals to indulge
himself we would but if as i suspect
the jovians have a puritan code well
have to go them one better

  oh well kruse grinned i fig-
ured as much and built up a reserve the
last time i was in luna city

  davenant felt a certain wistful envy
of the man he himself was too shy and
introverted he knew to make a decent
roisterer an occasional ring in a li-
censed rec house beer and gambling and
whatnot was about his speed if he were
rich-but engineers didnt get rich all
the profits of the order went hack into
the order and its development per-
sonnel from cadet to coordinator drew
small salaries and no bonuses the re-

wards were intangible-prestige com-
radeship a sense of being important to
mans highest and finest adventure

  a watch-cl tange bell broke up the dis-
cussion some went to sleep some to
their posts only kruse and davenant
remained in the little saloon the
venusian drifted across to a locker-
they were currently in free-fall orbit-
and got two bulbs of beer

  this ends my ration for today he
said care to join me hall

  sure davenant took one put the
tube in his mouth and squeezed the
cool tingle of it was refreshing

  kruse hooked a leg around a stanch-
ion and hung across the table from him
if im not getting too personal he
asked why did you join

  eh oh davenant felt himself
reddening for no good reason that
irritated him but he liked the big
venusian the usual they saw my
school and psych records offered me an
appointment i took it isnt that what
happens to everybody

  yeah sure but you were only four-
teen or fifteen then not really capable of
deciding such a thing a lot of kids
sign up because they think its glamor-
ous and drop out after a couple of years
what made you stick

  what makes anybody stick i was
a poor boy my father was one of the
intellectual routineer class which was
displaced by the second industrial rev-
olution though he never joined the hu-
manists he didnt like living off citi-
zens allowance and odd jobs-called it
a handout my people were alaskans
with some of the pioneer tradition left in
them but his health was too frail for
him to emigrate to mars or venus i
didnt want to go through that myself
davenant shrugged not meeting
kruses blue eyes there had been other
reasons-a girl other women since then
even if he wasnt a successful chaser
sometimes he wondered if a man ever
really falls out of love the pain stops
most of it and presently a new love
comes along but isnt she merely added
to the pantheon
the snows of ganymede	

  why do you ask  he said

  oh just getting acquainted kruse
shrugged me i was offered the same
and my folks urged me to accept par-
ents consent is needed on venus the
family is more important there than its
become in western earth itd be some-
thing for the clan to brag about a mem-
ber in the engineers so i did join and
im not sorry but i think ill resign aft-
er this job is over

davenant felt shocked how
come dont you like it

  sure but im pushing forty and
its time i raised a family the lucky
girl cant see living on luna so ive got
my eye on a valley in the hellfires lin-
der the development act i can home-
stead the whole place its just roclc and
sand now but give me a few years and
itll be the sweetest little oasis you ever
saw

  theres a breakdown coming said
davenant the humanists didnt stay
in power long no but thev were only
one symptom you can see corruption
and personal government are growing
youre better off belonging to an organ-
ization which is above such matters
now youre just parroting what your
trainers taught you said kruse its
probably true enough as far as earth is
concerned but venus is a big place
have you ever thought that maybe the
order is wrong  that maybe by setting
itself above the realities of politics its
cutting itself off from its own roots
davenant gulped beer and tried to set-
tle a suddenly chaotic mind it was not
merely that kruse spoke heresy the
order permitted even encouraged in-
dependent thinking for the simple rea-
son that a rigid brain was no good for
its purposes but the venusian what he
had seen of him had never given the
impression of being an intellectual be-
yond the requirements of his work a
skilled technician yes a big laughing
hard-fisted tosspot a collector of im-
proper limericks but he had no business
dealing in disquieting philosophies
davenant was not especially narrow

he read widely enjoyed music and
chess liked to think of himself as a bit
of a universalist but he realized now
with some dismay that his intellectually
formative years might have been too
bookish too concentrated on one ideal
and in ofie way of life he had crossed
millions of kilometers and seen strange
landscapes but had he ever looked into
the soul of a man-even his own

  lets have another beer he said
hastily we can borrow from tomor-
rows ration how about some chess

iv

een from space ganymede was
bleaker than luna herself-seamed with
mountains pocked with craters mottled
dark and light over her sterile face this
far from the sun her dayside was
wrapped in dusk since she always faced
jupiter the primary was gibbous or only
a great scimitar while the sun was up
and at high noon a total eclipse threw
blackness across the land

  as the cruiser approached her radar
picked up an object in orbit not far above
the surface metallic to judge from the
intensity of the returning signal

  odd muttered lyeil i know the
colonists broke up the old american and
most of their other spaceships for the
parts i didnt know theyd established
a satellite station

  he beamed a call but there was no
answer only the dry whisper of cosmic
interference

  mavhe a ship parked there sug-
gested yuan

  too big to be an ordinary ship well
-lets come down the hard way then

  it was a tricky job to ride a vessel as
massive as the light down a gca beam
but lyell managed it with hardly a
bump

  when they were in their cradle
davenant looked out and could not see
much of x-just the spacefield a radio
mast several buildings and a cluster of
other structures well distant most of it
must be underground

the sun was a tiny blinding flame in


startling stories

a sky nearly black the tremendous edge
of jupiter dominated heaven-amber
streaked with dull reds and blues and
greens and browns splotches which were
storms that could have swallowed earth
whole the planet was so big that it
seemed to be endlessly falling about to
crash ruinously on the broken face of its
moon io was visible as a giant sliver to
one side of the primary the whole sky
looked unnatural like something seen in
a dream

  a ring of hills shouldered starkly
above the horizon barely visible in the
vague cold misty twilight under which
the world seemed to lie davenant saw
fields of snow that must be frozen am-
monia and part of the range looked as if
it might be one enormous chunk of ice
the air was thin-nitrogen and argon a
wisp of methane and other gases

t una had been near home when the
first men reached it mars had had
some life at least venus had been a
wind-howling hell but rich with prom-
ise this place seemed to hold a perpet-
ual despair it was somehow the grim-
mest scene davenant had ever experi-
enced

  trying to shake off his depression he
pointed to the nearer buildings-long
low featureless boxes with an odd bluish
shimmer

  i wonder what those are made of
he asked

  ice i imagine said falkenhorst

  davenant blinked you mean solid
water

  surely said the martian theres
a lot of it on the galilean moons its a
pretty good insulator can be worked
with a blow-torch or cast into molds and
if you make your walls thick enough and
insulate them on the inside theyll do
fine at these temperatures

  davenant nodded he should have
realized that his training the whole
history of space colonization emphasized
that other worlds were not earth and
that a whole new approach was needed
for each one

  ill bet they use the absolute scale

habitually here he said itd be too
much trouble always to speak of minus a
hundred and some degrees centigrade

  youre getting the idea said falk-
enhorst

  there was  provision for taking a
spaceship cradle underground but a
small trac appeared drawing a long
plastitube two meters in diameter out of
a valve in one building it gripped
around the airlock and lyell led his
crew through it they were all in dress
uniform and wore their carefully
schooled dignity on their features

  emerging at the farther end of the
tube they stepped into a room which
struck them with chill the jovians
must have habituated themselves to such
temperatures to conserve power daven-
ant for one had to take conscious con-
trol of somatic reactions and force his
body to accept the conditions

  ten guards were drawn up on either
side of the entrance an immobile line
they had the gangling bulge-chested
slenderness which was also characteristic
of martians-low gravity low air pres-
sure even inside the settlements-but
this was exaggerated for they were eas-
ily two meters tall under steel helmets
their faces were white rather than sun-
darkened their uniform was a one-
piece black coverall fitting the muscular
bodies closely boots a belt supporting
pistol and pouch their heads were
shaven and they stood like robots

  it took a second glance for davenant
to realize that they were identical

  he jammed the sudden cold in his
mind back out of consciousness keep up
the act keep up the act an engineer is
never surprised

  two other men were waiting beyond
the guards one wore the same black
one-piece uniform with a star glittering
silver on the belt but he had his hair
he was rather short and stocky eyes
gray and utterly cold face harsh-scarred
the other man long and thin and com-
paratively serene-looking wore a blond
beard though his skull was bare and a
black robe with a white cross on the
breast he held back bowing silently as
the snows of ganymede	

the smaller man stepped forward and
spoke

  god with us welcome gemmen
had good trip

  thank you yes lyell inclined his
gaunt gray head i am captain lyell of
archimedes academy in charge of this
group

  cinc- halleck the dialect seemed
to be a variant of rather archaic english
a curious blend of soft slurring and crisp
rapid delivery the man gestured to his
robed companion angel- garson
another bow from that one can we
do yall a service 

  you might show us to our quarters
lyell said coolly

  baggage unloadin

  the ship is not to be touched said
lyell there are things in her which
could be dangerous to one not familiar
with details if you will lend us a porter
one of us will show him our personal
effects

  halleck nodded and spoke briefly into
a wrist-nhone as he stood looking over
the visitors he could almost be seen to
freeze his eyes strayed uncontrollably
to yuan and yamagata he jerked them
away only to have them rretum dave-
nant wondered why

a gray-clad hairless man entered
from a side door the first thing
noticeable about him was his gigantic
size and four arms the next and some-
how most lasting impression was of the
inhuman vacancv of his face

  porter gemmen said halleck

  at a signal from lyell davenant led
the way back through the tube the giant
followed wordlessly and said nothing
when the small heap of handbags was
pointed out to him-merely picked them
up and trudged back there was no rea-
son why the engineers should not have
carried their own things except the mat-
ter of dignity

  when davenant returned he found
lyell talking with halleck and falken-
horst with the angel garson who was
asking some shrewd questions alwut the
propulsion of the light davenant re-

called that the ion drive had still been
experimental when ganymede had been
colonized

  this way please

  halleck turned and led them out a
descending ramp wound into the body
of the world davenant noticed that the
identical guards were going before and
after the group and that their eyes were
never still

  weve assigned y a suite in sector
eight border between cinc an angel
territory halleck said y can easily
communicate with one service or tother
mealsll be brought there if yallll
gimme your prefrences ill try to have
em met though were not a rich
colony

  we dont ask for luxury said lyell
just remember that your dietary re-
quirements may have changed slightly
from ours

  the suite turned out to consist of six
small bedrooms and a bath surrounding
a larger common chamber the furniture
was simple comfortable enough under
low-gee conditions but the whole place
had a barren and empty look after a
moments thought davenant traced that
impression down to the completely un-
imaginative inartistic appearance every-
thing seemed to have been laid out with
a ruler and the lining plastic was drab
gray oh well

  garson showed them -the com-unit
with which they could call up various
offices when they wanted something and
gave them a collection of large-scale
maps of city and satellite

  further reference works whenever
yall wish he said pie had a meek way
of speaking imagine yall want to get
unpacked and rested call me when you
wish a first conference

  cinc- shoulda met yall himself i
know added halleck though without
any air of apology but youll see him
soon enough weve little ceremony
here god with you gemmen

  he saluted crisply and backed out the
door his guards followed him the
angel bowed and went out last

  well kruse threw his bulk onto a


startling stories

low couch charming hospitality
different mores lyell said absent-
ly that may have been their equivalent
of a brass band and parade for all i
know dont go insisting on any special
favors boys pass all that through me
he frowned im afraid weve made a
mistake right at the beginning

  how so asked falkenhorst
bringing yuan and yamagata
what in space- demanded kruse
whats wrong with em the two
men spoken of retreated into expression-
lessness

  nothing of course snapped lyell
but we should have remembered the
idiotic race prejudice which was so im-
portant to the colonys founders ap-
parently its still present didnt you
see how halleck was reacting

  race kruse broke into a guffaw
after some of the types they seem tove
been breeding here

  prejudices dont have to be logical
or consistent lyell told him in fact
they usually arent its sheer lucky
chance that we didnt happen to bring a
negro engineer he glanced at yuan
and yamagata i think you two boys
can get by if were discreet a mon-
goloid doesnt look that much different
from a white man

  a pink man you mean yamagata
grinned

  it just points out how much we have
to watch ourselves said lyell

  oh well if they get too offended
theyll merely send us home said
falkenhorst let them freeze forever
then

t yell demurred this job is more
important to the order than you
seem to realize not only the profit we
stand to make but this will be the first
large-scale terraforming job weve had
the mars and venus projects were al-
ready well under wav when the old
corps was founded weve handled big
jobs yes but nothing of comparable
magnitude the value of this task in
experience and prestige is inestimable
itll go a long way toward getting us that

monopoly of our kind of work which we
need for power and safety

  davenant who had been doing some
heavy thinking since his talk with kruse
didnt quite like the tone of that was
it so certain that the order had a right
to such power he brooded over it
while he unpacked

  lyell called up the commissariat office
and asked for dinner it was brought by
four-armed men the same type as the
porter though not identical with him
the silence with which they served the
meal was eerie when lyell asked one
of them a question he shook his head in
an animal way and pointed to his throat

  either mute or under orders not to
speak said davenant i wonder
why there was a coldness along his
spine

  the food was mostly synthetic not
especially good though some effort had
been made to spice it kruse grimaced
and reached for the decanter which ex-
periment had shown to hold some
alcoholic liquid

  go easy on that rotgut warned
lyell remember our official doctrine
is austerity

  kruse shrugged its awful anyway
lucky i stuck a few bottles of scotch in
my bag

when a service bell brought the
waiters back to clear off the dishes
davenant wondered if x lacked machin-
ery for such work or if live service had
the same ostentation value it had on
earth pie consulted the citv maps and
decided it was no machinery logical
enough a precarious colonv on an in-
human world didnt have materials or
labor to spare for making luxury robots

  the maps were highly detailed and
it took a good manv of them to cover
the whole three-dimensional warren
davenant gathered that this was the offi-
cial level where cincs and angels had
their offices and the lower echelons
lived further down were the cells
given to sergeants apparently the com-
moners who surely didnt have much
sleeping space elsewhere were factories
the snows of ganymede



laboratories creches assembly halls
storerooms

   one sector of x was marked cinc--
but otherwise left blank the rulers
didnt seem to publicize the layout of
their quarters perhaps for fear of envi-
ous comparisons

   i get a general picture of an oligarchy
as hard-boiled as any in history re-
marked lyell after considering the
maps those guards for instance-
obviously thevre exogenes from one
cell

  would the jovians know that tech-
nique wondered falkenhorst

  oh yes said yuan it was used a
good two hundred years ago by the old
un inspectorate to create a corps of
gifted secret service men its been public
for more than half that time though little
applied identical heredity identical
training-the psychological effects are
curious for you get a completely devoted
band of brothers then the four arms-
that indicates the jovians are well up on
the newer methods of gene and chromo-
some manipulation either they got data
from earth or they developed the sys-
tem independently most likely the first
since they have had some contact i dare
say the commoners sergeants whatever
you call them are bred and trained and
regarded as animals-specialized types
no i cant say i like jovian society

  that angel-odd name-garson
seems a pretty decent sort said yama-
gata how about calling him and pump-
ing him now

   idont know what his sleeping hours
are said lyell rut we can i suppose
he went over to the com

   a ringing doorbell some minutes later
announced their visitor as davenant
opened the door he heard a loud-speaker
system filling the corridor with

   - yes the lord is mighty brethren
an his hand lies heavy rouse not the
arger o the lord for he whos cursed
by him is cursed indeed rather show
that meekness and obedience whichre
pleasin unto him-

   sermons yet as davenant closed the
door he was glad it was sound-proof

  garsous expression was a peculiar
mixture of timidity and eagerness when
he was offered a chair he sat on the very
edge and he was given to starting at any
sudden movement

  how official are you asked lyell
if you can speak for the government
id like to get some questions straighten-
ed out at once

  we- garson fumbled for words
my class is religious y understand
mercy- he hesitated seeming unsure
how to address the guest sir he fin-
ished we conduc services an-intel-
lectual activities too engineering pro-
cedure is our province as far as yallre
concerned though we dont make policy
good enough you understand we
are here only as a survey group to find
out if it will be possible at all to trans-
form ganymede and callisto it will take
a good deal of work a long time to
learn even that much and we shall have
to ask for help from your people
crews will-be assigned sir re-
plied garson equipment an- his
voice trailed off and he combed his thin
beard with nervous fingers

  they will be under our direction
exclusively

  if y wish sir rut- the angel
paused again from what y already
know o conditions here sir what-what
hopes dvou have o success

  i would rather not say answered
lyell not yet every world presents
its own problem how much do you
know about earlier projects of this na-
ture 

   verv little sir id be uh grateful for
what y can tell me

lyell settled back for a lecture
well then he said venus was
made habitable by chemical treatment
to get the poisons out of the atmos-
phere by special bacteria strains which
released oxygen from its compounds and
by hydrogen explosions to bring water
to the surface to mention only the most
superficial aspects of a task which took
more than a century ft is still going on
as far as desert reclamation is concerned
	startling stories

plant types were developed to fit the
new conditions and as the environment
changes with time still other forms will
be introduced animal life was brought
from earth or rather its reproductive
cells were with exogenesis on venus to
start the first generation

  on mars now the problem has been
in many ways different there were no
poison gases and there was a little oxy-
gen and surface water although not near-
ly enough for human life still it was a
start more oxygen was obtained by bac-
terial process more water by drilling but
it was still necessary to import a great
deal-

  where from sir garson asked
eagerly the fuel requirements musta
been fantastic if-uh-from earth

  lyell smiled no from saturn the
rings are mostly ice there are even en-
ormous meteors or smr moons of ice
it took several years work and was
tricky to give a number of big chunks
enough of a push to fall sunward and
make them hit mars just where desired
but-well it was practicable large
scale electrolysis and other treatment for
some of it

  the whole task was costly and en-
ormous of course but when millions of
people with atomic energy and the re-
sources of a whole planet even a small
one behind them bend all their efforts to
a job it gets done oh yes much carbon
dioxide was also required to give suf-
ficient greenhouse effect at that distance
from the sun

  in spite of all this mars will always
be a cold and arid world with a thin at-
mosphere so the geneticists had to
meet conditions halfway bv creating not
only plants and lower animals but even
slightly modified human strains which
can be comfortable in such an environ-
ment and there are other complications
such as making up the gas which con-
tinually leaks into space i tell you mars
is a tough problem

  its being solved on the other hand
no one would even try to give an atmos-
phere to luna or mercury our whole
approach is different there concentrating

on things like more efficient airlocks and
larger underground installations

  the available materials and energy
sources also determine a great deal on
mercury or luna sun-power can be
used directly or stored in capacitors in
the early days on venus the hilsch tube
was important and wind power still is
on mars though it was necessary to use
atomic energy so extensively that its re-
serves are depleted and we must con-
centrate on the physics of low potential
wc hope to help out when our solar-
btam stations on mercury are finished

  but i freely predict that no one will
ever found a real colony on say the
moons of uranus there are no energy
sources to speak of no useful minerals
theyre too far away for power beamed
from mercury not only is it not worth-
while but it isnt a practical possibility
so you see ganymede and callisto will
have to be studied carefully before we
can know what the chances are of mak-
ing them habitable-or indeed doing
anything with them

  davenants right shoulder itched he
longed to scratch it but made himself
sit impassively lyells lecture was for
a definite purpose-to impress to gain
a certain slight moral ascendancy it
wouldnt do to break up the act of men-
tor just to scratch inwardly he
squirmed

  weve-ah-weve done well so far
sir garson said diffidently therere
fifty thousand people in x alone besides
smaller cities an isolated outposts i
think theres good hope

  possibly said lyell with a note of
calculated skepticism but do you have
decent ore deposits so we can get struc-
tural metals how much water is there
in all how much of every type of
compound how available is the oxy-
gen  i dont think biological techniques
will get it out for you i doubt if any
bacterium can be made which wont die
or spore up at these temperatures

yuan murmured there might be
ways even so but id have to have
some figures before knowing if i have a
practical idea

  what energy sources do you have
lyell persisted can tap internal
heat or isnt there enough the sun is
too far away to help much even with
power beaming offhand i think the
thing to do is sink shrifts and start hydro-
gen-lithium fires down in them to warm
up the body of the moon some of that
energy could be tapped to make an out-
door lighting system then there is the
problem of getting rid of the methane and
ammonia

  the surface area of ganymede is
something like eighty-five million square
kilometers you can see what a gigantic
task we have interplanetary freight
rates being what they are it cannot be
done at all unless most of the work and
resources come from this world itself
even if we take the job the engineers
cannot supply the whole labor force
most of it must be supplied from your
own people and can you spare so many
that calls for socio-economic analysis

  in short we are here now to see if
you yourselves under our direction
can swing the job even the survey will
require cooperation even for it we
may have to call on you for a great deal
in the way of materials and manpower
we must have carle blanche to go any-
where and get any information are you
willing to set that much at stake against
the mere possibility that we can help
you

  o course said garson yd not
a been asked ay-tall if we werent there
are-uh-some facts whichre-confiden-
tial but the engineers respect their cli-
ents secrets dont they

  lyell nodded if nothing else we can
show you some modern techniques he
said for instance molar potential bar-
riers to eliminate airlocks and all their
clumsiness in fixed installations more
efficient food synthesis reactions and so
on

  garson actually blushed have you
-uh-considered-the terms yet sir

  the abbey has already agreed with
your representative on the flat rate for a
survey payment for further work will
depend on what we want and what you
can afford that can be negotiated
later

startling stories

the angel was clearly shy of strangers
and glad when he found an excuse to
leave he set an hour for the next meet-
ing at which a formal commission would
begin the real business and made his
good nights

  lyell stared after him i wonder
what hes afraid of he muttered eyes
narrowing

  us maybe said yamagata stran-
gers coming into a pathologically xeno-
phobic culture-hmmra he stopped
i just had an idea think these people
know basic

  i doubt it said falkenhorst
why

  hall-yamagata turned to dave-
nant an odd look on his face-you have
your general unit handy he was
speaking the new semantically rigorous
language now want to check the wir-
ing in this room 

  magnetic tracing of circuits revealed
what he had suspected-microphones
recorders behind the plastic facing of the
walls

  lyells mouth drew tight thats a
violation of-

  different mores chief falken-
horsts gibe held a note of strain

  we can make an official complaint
suggested yuan

  set up a resonator and burn the damn
things out cried davenant or keep
a magnetic field to wipe the tapes at
least

  hell grunted kruse leave em
alone but give em something really in-
teresting to record

  no-no lyell shook his head
none of that not yet not till we know
more of the situation im afraid weve
already given away much we can ill af-
ford but ill have to think about it
meanwhile keen to english for ordinary
purposes switch to basic when neces-
sary but watch your tongues every
minute

  davenant looked around the room
he had known the inanimate savagery of
planets but this was the first time he
had ever encountered hostilitv from men
the walls seemed to move together and
close in on him

    anymede spun twice around
jupiter a period of slightly more than
two weeks while lyells men were only
starting their task learning the bare ele-
ments of jovian society most of their
work was with the angels studying maps
and references in the library conferring
and asking questions but they could
hardly help acquiring unofficial informa-
tion

  garson who seemed to have taken a
fancy to davenant conducted him
through the city the factories and
maintenance centers were fairly standard
for a colony though archaic in design
and using an undue amount of human
labor that was performed by sergeants
under angel supervisors watching a
long assembly line of gray-clad un-
speaking men davenant felt a coldness
in his stomach he had never seen hu-
man beings so used

  why havent you installed robot ma-
chinery he asked this could all be
fully automatic

  garson shrugged large investment
o material an labor in robots he said
 cheaper easier t use men trained from
birth

  so the commoners were part of the
machinery they didnt count for more
than the lathes and furnaces they
manned davenant had that fact driven
home to him when he walked through
the human robots part of town-end-
less monotonous cells almost devoid of
individuality no privacy anywhere al-
ways the conditioning by broadcast ser-
mons and minute regulations of con-
duct the faces which looked at him
meeklv were masks  humanness had been
rubbed out

  not many women were in sight and
those he saw were muffled in shapeless
gray gowns and veils they had their
own assignments in such lighter work as
food-making and product inspection
and they were breeders garson justi-
fied their status with biblical quotations

  there was little family life children
the snows of ganymede	

were taken young to the creches for con-
ditioning on the basis of psych tests
some were picked for angel and some for
cine to be raised in those services and
never told who their parents were

  the angels were the priesthood and
spent their lives under a monastic rule
which made the abbey seem mild-
though they were not celibate they
were also the intellectual and artistic
class the engineers poets scientists phi-
losophers of sorts they compiled the
data davenant was now studying and
served as administrative advisors

  in spite of the humility which was
drilled into them they seemed more hu-
man more individual than any other
class on ganymede fat jolly wilkins
shy dreamy bliss keen intense jackson
small sardonic hobart earnest tongue-
tied garson-davenant could get along
with them

  as a group the angels were a power
in the community and had had their
clashes with the cincs the cincs who
were the rulers had the upper hand for
cincs of first and second grade were ex
officio archangels

  but sometimes the corps resisted them
successfully garson told with relish the
story of a few years ago when cinc-
had tried to seize property owned by the
angels they had refused to obey him
and had held out until a junta of his own
subordinates had replaced him with a
more reasonable man

  davenant met the chief cine when the
engineers were invited to the cine area
halleck conducted them together with a
troop of hounds

  lyell tried to draw halleck out a lit-
tle i take it these guards of yours are
for show

  no halleck looked surprised
protection

  from whom the sergeants
haw the sergeants know their
place i hope a few publicly owned
hounds can keep them in order but y
see every cine above novice grade is
entitled to his own corps o guards as
many as he can support

  i dont quite understand lyell said

smoothly if the commoners arent
dangerous why should a cine need a
personal army

  the other cincs o course clipped
halleck god gives victory to the
righteous but we men cant know who
that is manyre called but fewre chos-
en so all got to have their chance
lyell did not press the matter but he
traded a glance with falkenhorst

cinc territory was a change from the
poverty elsewhere in x the floors
were carpeted the walls and ceilings col-
orful with murals the individual apart-
ments spacious and luxuriously fur-
nished davenant got the impression that
each housed its own harem several oth-
er officers passed by exchanging salutes
with halleck and there was a flicker of
hatred in their eyes none had jess than
two bodyguards in tow and each car-
ried a side-arm

  a massive steel door was protected by
machine-guns behind armor plating
halleck strode up to meet die tall hound
who stood in front of the barricade
god with us

  service to the lord 

  i bring cinc-ls guests heres my
pass

  the hound studied it carefully yes
mercy tf youll leave yr men an yr
pistol here-

  halleck smiled scarcasticallv and sub-
mitted davenant did not like the swift
competent hands which passed over him
in search of weapons but his resentment
faded when he was let through the door
the reception hall was a blaze of color
and crude magnificence

  a servant lxwed low female young
and comely she was not dressed in any
long drab gown quite the opposite
kruse opened his mouth in an admiring
grin but snapped it shut as he remem-
bered where he was

  ill announce you mercy the girl
said service to the lord

  cinc- weller was short and rather
stout but the eyes in his broad red face
were restless and cold he greeted the
engineers with an anibigous salute and
waved them to chairs davenant was un-


startling stories

easily aware of the motionless guards
standing against the wall

  i trust yr accommodations re good
weller said anything y need

  not just yet mercy answered ly-
ell before long well be making our
initial surveys and will want workers
and equipment but that can doubtless
be arranged through the angel corps
course course weller accepted a
drink from a well-trained servant if
yall do need somethin please ask fr it
well mercy-lyell rubbed his

more already now the question is can
your particular culture stand the intro-
duction of so much new technology 

  wellers face darkened for an in-
stant davcnant thought he was going to
order his men to shoot the engineers
down

  he returned to a hard surface calm and
replied judicially i dont see why not
spose y mean assembly-line workers an
their like whatll happen to em if their
jobs re automatized thats really not
your business we can build such ma-

 poul andersons future history

back in the early s robert a heinlein let it le known that he was
writing stories according to a consistent future history all his work
fitted into a pattern of history as it might happen and an outline of that
history was published so that readers could see the stories in perspective

  poul anderson who wrote the lead novel in this issue also uses such a
history and were happy to publish part of it here

  anderson emphasizes two points about the history a this is only a
bare outline of a much more complex tiling b the dates given are not
to be taken too seriously for that would take the scheme out of the range
of science-fiction prediction and into the realm of fantasy and prophecy
which is not one i care to inhabit

  he hasnt tried to make all his stories conform to the scheme and has
no wish to do so but on the opposite page youll find the first  years of
andersons history which closes with the action in the snotvs of ganymede
other btories already written but which cannot be shown on the abbrevi-
ated chart are the troublemakers  gypsy  star ship 
the star ways  entity  and symmetry -the editor

chin-there is one thing we lack and
that is information

  oh cant the angels give y all the
facts

  about physical data yes said lyell
but we need a more detailed social an-
alysis than anything thats been given
us an important factor in deciding how
much can be done here is the capability of
the people themselves for instance it
will be necessary to construct a great
deal of automatic machinery frankly
mercy im disappointed that there isnt

chines put em at your disposal what
we do with em afterward concerns us
alone

  perhaps said lyell though con-
sider mercy human assembly lines
simply cannot produce what will be need-
ed at the rate it will be needed so there
will at the very least be an interim where
your sergeants have no place to work-
except out in the field with us and there
they will frankly be of little use unless
you recondition and educate them at
present i have the impression that most

	startling stories

of them dont have the effective intelli-
gence to use complcx machines after
a pause he added maliciously of
course angels and cincs could be as-
signed to our crews but that would also
disrupt your social structure

  hm-yes-problem there admitted
weller grudgingly it calls fr study
im sure a solution can be found
another question drawled yama-
gata is callisto inhabited or is it not
why no said halleck when wel-
ler failed to reply what made you
think it was we havent expanded that
much yet

  there were references in books and
conversation implying a small colony
there said yamagata but nobody i
asked would give me a straight answer

weller spoke almost genially as if
glad to leave an awkward subject
oh i see small group o settlers there
from earth some twenty-five years ago
came out t escape troubles durin the
humanist affair they couldnt make a
go of it alone so they came here and
joined with us all but forgotten now
he thinks fast on his feet observed
davenant but he wouldnt be the chief
in this nest of devils unless he did

  if i may say so mercy put in
lyell your culture is an odd blend of
the communal and the highly individ-
ualistic sergeants are trained to abso-
lute obedience but most of your new
works are carried out by individual cincs
who patronize some gifted angel or some
new construction project or the like
davenant nodded to himself he had
noticed as much and decided the motiva-
tion was a compounded desire for power
and prestige

  lyell went on so far that system
has worked well enough because al-
most everything you could name had
to be done anvway-mines started out-
lying settlements founded machinery
built but it wilj take the coordinated
effort of all your people to transform
these moons do you think the members
of the cine class can be trusted to work
cooperatively

  ill see they do weller forced a

laugh y go a long way to criticize us
only as far as i must mercy its
not my business to judge the way you
have chosen to order your affairs to date
but insofar as that affects my job i have
a duty to make suggestions

  we dont have t employ the order
weller said coldly we can do the job
ourselves y know

  as you wish mercy

  lyell was poker-faced but it was clear
enough that he had the whip hand the
jovians were not capable of the enter-
prise they lagked the special skills and
resources it called and as long as they
were locked underground dependent on
a complex of machines and chemicals for
the most elementary necessities of life
they could never amount to anything in
solar trade or politics

  the conversation at supper turned to
the inner planets davenant noticed that
weller never lost a chance to needle hal-
leck-small personal remarks and sights
which brought the cinc-s rage close to
boiling over it was not a comfortable
party

  back in their own suite the engineers
dropepd into basic for the benefit of the
recorders

  i cant say im overly fond of our
hosts declared yuan mechanized
common people fear and hate and ambi-
tion the prime motives of the rulers i
wonder if we ought to do their job for
them

  you know our rule about local poli-
tics said lyell

  seems you were doing your share of
politicking tonight chief yamagata
said slyly

  ive the authority to make sugges-
tions answered lyell if they go un-
heded i can give a negative report which
will make the abbey drop the job but
thats all

  theres something inhuman about
the setup declared kruse people
arent robots the sergeant class simply
cant be treated that way indefinitely
thevll either mutiny or degenerate to
uselessness

  i think- falkenhorst hesitated
the snows of ganymede	

yes youre right torvald but there
must be some safety valve some outlet
for them id like to know what it is

  that was discovered two earth days
later davenant was going through some
maps in the library checking resources
of fissionables with garsons help when
the angel yawned and stretched and
said

  mights well quit now holy time
cornin up an therell be no work fr
forty-eight hours

  a special service do you mean
asked davenant feeling the vague dis-
comfort which mention of religious in-
timacies always gave him

  yes feast o the three prophets
we have holy times once in a while sev-
rl times an earth year garson hesi-
tated why dont y come hall you
look like y could use some fun

jtvavenant thought some people
have their own ideas of fun
thought davenant but the prospect had
a certain morbid interest doubtless it
would be boring as a drill-mech nev-
erthless-

  wouldnt people mind he asked
im not a member of your church after
all

  oh no trouble stan back to the
rear at first later on y can join in all
y want garson smiled shyly we
might even convert you

  well-all right davenant noted
the time and place and went off to his
supper

  the others of his band refused some-
what profanely to come near the serv-
ice they preferred kruses idea of
wiping the recorders with a magnetic
field and locking themselves in with
some bottles

  lyell approved if you want to go
hall its not a bad notion the more
we can learn about these people the bet-
ter

  davenant changed to a clean dress
uniform and went down a series of
ramps and corridors as he neared the
great assembly room the press around
him grew thick-commoners streaming

in from all parts of the city men and
women and children mingled together
they were silent but there was a curious
eagerness on their faces

  the hall was a gigantic natural cavern
which had been enlarged until it could
accommodate the entire population of x
it was painted and tapestried into an
explosion of color huge streaks and jags
of green purple gold blood-red swirl-
ing on the walls there were no benches
so everyone stood but the floor was soft-
ly textured

  at the farther end rising out of semi-
darkness was a sort of stage with an al-
tar all the angels in x seemed gathered
there rank on rank of them like robed
statues the only cine in sight was
weller who sat on the stage between his
guards

  davenant found a place against a wall
the gray-clad sergeants who crowded
around hardly seemed to notice the
stranger their eyes were fixed with a
curious greed on the stage and they
breathed heavily music was coming
from somewhere archaic syncopated
stuff which caught at the pulse with a
primitive force davenant wondered at
the feeling of lightness and elation that
seemed to be rising within him

  o brethren- it was all the an-
gels a huge male chorus ringing like dis-
tant thunder between the ends of the
cave praise ye the lord in whom all
are one thank vc the lord for the gift
of life and for his manifold mercies

  effective thought davenant i won-
der why ive heard better in luna city
but as the chorus rose and swelled he
felt an odd lump in his throat the man
beside him was weeping

  organ tones pealed like the voice of
heaven

  the sermon began from the lips of an
elderly angel who only yesterday had
been discussing gas-diffusion processes
with davenant it started quietly
enough solemn as the music with the
angel reciting the virtues of humility
and hard work davenant found it rath-
er reasonable

  then the tempo picked up


startling stories

  an yet whore we mis-rable wal-
lowers in sin that we should walk this
world we whore slothful an greedy
an lustful we whos so blackened that
only the blood o the lamb can ever wash
us clean   say t y all the devil is wait-
in  on the black planet which is called
hell he waits fr us hes ready t lick
us down his hot gullet down into the lake
of eternal fire-you an you an you
few are they wholl find mercy in the
sight o the lord an great is the wailin
in hell-

  people stamped their feet giant
dwarf multiple-armed tentacle-armed
the pure-human majority they jerked
and moaned and swayed with the
rhythm of the words music rose around
them a sinister harrying of notes gone
wild and the angel roared abomination
down on them

 amen amen the lord have mercy
on me a sinner

  davenants knees felt weak his heart
thick in his breast he was doomed and
done for outcast alone every shame of
his life was rising to mock him and he
gasped with the pain of it everyone
was groveling on the floor now creeping
toward the altar wailing their miserable
little sins to the world and he he he
alone was damned

  hallelujah

it took a minute before davenant
realized that the shout had been his
own

  that brought him up short a word
screamed in his brain and he doubled up
against the wall and grabbed for its sup-
port supersonics

  or subsonics he wasnt sure he
couldnt remember in the confusion that
bawled around him but he knew that
inaudible sound waves in the right fre-
qencies do strange things to the human
nervous system the take-off of a rocket
gives a man a moment of irrational dread
there are combinations of wave lengths
which stimulate the thalamus exalt the
emotional response while suppressing
the action of the critical reasoning fore-
brain

  it had been a standard part of psycho-
therapy for a long time it was being
used here on a giant scale

  knowing it was a help davenant
fought back toward sanity he felt his
heart pulsing with the words that rolled
around him he was frightened and joy-
ous and enraged all at once but it could
be controlled he licked his lips and won-
dered how long he would have to hold
out

  praise ye therefore the lord for his
mercy endureth give thanks and re-
joice that he made ye

  hang on boy hang on stay where
you are

  in the seething of the mob it hardly
seemed incongruous that the angels
should suddenly be tossing out plastibot-
tles one landed beside davenant he
picked it up unscrewed the cap and
tasted as the others were doing it
burned in his throat a hundred and
fifty proof at least

  the music rose with a triumphant
surge and thunder he saw the nearest
man turn grunting and snatch in a curi-
ously blind way at a woman she strug-
gled for a moment as if against some
dying fragment of convention then fell
into his arms he fumbled at the sleazy
material of her dress lifting it as he
forced her toward the floor

  so thats their safety valve

  a hand plucked at his it felt hot and
wet with excitement turning he saw
another woman pulling at him dis-
ordered hair streamed past a face which
glistened with sweat and contorted with
laughter

  cmon honey she said les go

  he shivered and stiffened himself
no-no thanks he mumbled

  arms were around his neck even in
low-gravity her weight was dragging
him down yre a new un she said
cmon have some fun its awright

  she felt soft and hot against him
helplessly he stared down the open neck
of her dress her lips sought his greed-
ilv it was like an explosion inside him
he sank to his knees and she laughed
and pushed her body against his
the snows of ganymede	

  wildly he wanted to accept nobody
would know and - and - glancing
around he saw that the floor was littered
with couples and that the younger an-
gels were leaping off the stage to join
the party there was a tightness in his
throat and a hammering in his temples
hed been a long time without a woman

 no

  he pulled himself free shuddering
damn it im an engineer he- gasped
more to himself than to her

  whas the matter she demanded
insistently

  he thrust her away no he said
harshly go find someone else-

  ugliness crossed her face y cant
huh 

  he wanted to show her otherwise but
only shook his head angrily she laughed
unpleasantly and moved off it took him
a full minute to recover his wits

  davenant looked up at the stage then
weller was rising to go either he had
superhuman self-control or more likely
there was a heterodyning vibrator
mounted near his seat custom had ap-
parently required his presence but-

  suddenly  he fell

 his guards swarmed around him
peering into the shadows davenant
saw half a dozen men under one of the
high columns they were dressed as
commoners but stood aloof he pushed
closer recklessly and saw halleck
among them

a machine-gun chattered from the
wings other hounds came into
view methodically mowing down wel-
lers guards they were in the majority
they operated with smooth coordination
and the whole right was over inside a
minute the survivors withdrew bear-
ing their wounded

  halleck and his followers turned qui-
etly and left the hall davenant made out
the faces of at least two cincs he had
met so several of them must have got
together on this a group conspiracy
would be the onlv way probably to get
past wellers defenses now the junta
would install a new cinc- and-

  few if any of the brawling crowd had
noticed what went on they were too
busy with their own affairs

  davenant felt oddly light-headed it
must be the aftermath of the sonics the
only sensible thing to do was beat it back
to the engineers he had no business
mixing into this bloody mess which was
jovian politics but his own impetus car-
ried him along his will gone

  two men on the stage were looking
down at the bodies which littered it one
wore cine uniform one was an angel
both were high-ranking to judge by
their insignia

  davenant got down on all fours and
crawled toward the stage the pairs and
groups wallowing about him were cover
of a sort if he was noticed at all in the
dim light he might be taken for a com-
monor or he might get a bullet in his
skull

  near the stage he lay prone and called
on his mental training he had a degree
of conscious control over the involuntary
functions he could drop the sensory bar-
riers and heighten perceptions as some
hysterics do without volition just
enough to hear what was being said-

  in basic

  the shock of that turned his muscles
rigid for a moment there was dark-
ness before his eyes it faded and he
heard the angel speaking

  so far so good but will halleck be
more manageable

  ive been his mentor since he was a
child answered the cine conscious-
ly of course he distrusts me as much
as does anyone else but tve made it
plain that tm not after the highest rank
so he will listen to me at least and i
know what buttons to push

  well have to proceed cautiously a
whole culture cant be rushed into any-
thing new with a note of grim hu-
mor the angel added we ought to
know that by now

  of course of course but were do-
ing all right weve come a long way
since callisto pass the word around-
conference at  tomorrow arrange
it as an ostensible discussion of policy
	startling stories

with regard to these engineers which
it will be in a way though we want only
our people in on it

  all right ill send you an official
memorandum lets go

  they walked off the stage it was a
long time before davenant gathered him-
self together enough to leave

  when he entered his quarters kruse
looked up with a rather bleared expres-
sion iwhats the matter hall seen
a ghost

  davenant drew a shaky breath yes
in a way

  lyell stood up what do you
mean

  i mean- davenant looked at the
floor then up again to meet their eyes
with a certain desperation i mean ive
found out who really runs ganymede
oh the service you went to you
mean the angels are more powerful than
they act

  davenant shook his head cincs and
angels are played off-manipulated
its the psychotechs from earth

vi

htstfs nemsis ate so the
old greeks summed up the rise and doom
and fall of men it is a formula which
has gone through all history

  much partisan nonsense has been writ-
ten about the psychotechnic institute it
was neither the only savior of a reeling
civilization nor the tyrant which
strangled mans right to be an individual
it was a band of men and women who
for generations strove toward a high
ideal wrought mightily and at the last-
as might have been foreseen-encoun-
tered problems they could not solve
somewhat as the medieval church nur-
tured western civilization the institute
was a kind of placenta for technic so-
ciety in both cases an outgrown matrix
was becoming constrictive and hacl to be
broken and in both cases the act of
breaking threw men back temporarily to
disorganization and unreason

the tragic flaw in the character of in-

stitute personnel was only that they were
human

  scientific method was first successful-
ly applied to social processes in the nine-
teenth century when statistics were used
to accumulate and winnow data the
basic-theoretical approach was developed
in the twentieth century along several
lines of attack-games theory communi-
cations theory general semantics the
principle of last effort generalized epis-
temology

  the original psychotechnic institute
eventually absorbed all similar groups
devoting itself to study it came up with
some fundamental equations describing
human relations the approach was that
of field dynamics it discoveries about
the psychomatics of the individual were
of even greater ultimate importance but
centuries would pass before those bore
full fruit

  what counted around  was a pre-
cise formulation of certain basic laws
governing the action of groups no one
pretended that the science was perfect it
had to admit large probable errors but
it was immediately usable and the world
of  badly needed a guide

  governments had long been relying on
experts it was only natural for them
to continue doing so as time went on
the institute came to train nearly all the
psychotechnicians to inculcate them with
its own ideals and to keep in contact
with them after they had gone into ac-
tive service

  political debate was conditioned by
their reports the tendency was for
them to become administrators the in-
stiutes leaders foresaw the growth of
their own power but they did not
snatch after it it came to them of its
own accord because only they could for-
mulate policies for a world still wounded
and feverish policies which had a reas-
onable hope of success

  and so step by step came the eco-
nomic recovery and improvement of all
earth the strengthening of world gov-
ernment the slow withering of national-
ism  education which for the first time
in centuries really fitted the needs of the
the snows of ganymede	

individual and of his society the gradual
decline of population on an overcrowded
planet the effective conservation of nat-
ural resources  raitonal economics  sane
penology generally available psychiatric
care critical thinking

  it was not easy there were setbacks
interminable debates deadly undercover
struggles-but the foundation was being
laid

  the reasons for the final breakdown of
this progress were complex but three
main threads may be traced first there
was a deep cultural resistance in a ma-
jority of earths population as asia
became more and more the economic
center of the world this unwillingness
gained power

  the road was after all long and hard
and it involved the scrapping of tradi-
tions which had existed since prehuman
times in many ways it went against
animal instinct and peoples without the
technological bias of the west were in-
clined to draw the line somewhere and
stick by it

  second the bulk of humanity simply
was not fitted to absorb the new attitudes
cold rationality and a high degree of self-
abnegation do not come naturally to nine-
ty-nine per cent of the race individual
psychology suggested ways to get around
this but there was no way to recondition
a billion and a half human creatures en
mass

  third there was mass unemployment
on a scale never seen before as compu-
ters automatons and semi-volitional ma-
chines replaced men on one continent aft-
er another not only the unskilled la-
borer but his highly trained brother and
the routine intellectual-clerk recorder
librarian local administrator laboratory
assistant the expert some thousands of
professions-was no longer needed

  the process took a long time to near
completion and there were many at-
tempts to alleviate its effects but nothing
not even the great emigration to mars
and venus was enough at the nadir of
the situation only some twenty-five per
cent of the adult population of earth was
even partially employed

of course no one starved a citi-
izens allowance was enough to
assure living quite comfortably hut the
genius class which could still work and
get extra money for it was hated and
envied yet the geniuses had to be paid
or not enough of them would have ac-
cepted the positions which still had to be
filled by humans

  it is not good for a society when most
of its citizens have no vested interest in
its smooth operation the atmosphere
of restlessness and despair tainted even
the leaders

  out of all this rose humanism which
amounted to a desire to restore a stream-
lined version of entirely imaginary good
old days the institute was shocked by
the rapidity with which the movement
grew it was made the more dangerous
by the general availability of superdie-
lectrics accumulators of fantastic capa-
city which could be charged from almost
anything cheap simple energy sources
for vehicles and weapons

  the balance of military power was
shifting away from central government
and toward the small fanatic group it
was no longer possible to enforce order

  the institute had had its own secret
machinations before this there was for
instance the inoculation of a precalcu-
lated percentage of the cost-free synthetic
food supplements with chemical contra-
ceptive followed by specious public ex-
planations of the falling birth rate
there was the quiet subversion of the
most -inflexible archaist organizations
there was much more which had been
deemed necessary but could not go
through the process of democratic agree-
ment

  the new situation was ugly anti-ro-
bot riots the lynching of technies and
scientists the election of intellectually
corrupt representatives - lunacy was
building up as rapidly and unnecessarily
as-to quote a classic example-it did
in the old united states between world
wars ii and iii

  the earth sections of the union gov-
ernment were calling less and less on
trained men going back more and more


startling stories

to rule of thumb something had to be
done

  and the field equations did not in-
dicate a solution

  there is no reason to detail the in-
creasingly frantic efforts of the institutes
leaders to stop the avalanche some of
their methods were actually unlawful
and when this was exposed the results
were evil the naval mutiny the human-
ist revolution and seizure of power the
withdrawal of earth from the solar un-
ion-these are matters of record

  the humanists soon found out
though that they could not repeal his-
tory could not abolish the technology on
which men were now dependent mars
and venus backed the counter-revolu-
tion the shaky regents were over-
thrown and the new government re-
joined the union-but the seeds of inter-
planetary rivalry and distrust had been
sown

  tame psychotechnians could not be
dispensed with but their powers were
rigidily limited the generations to come
would be turbulent one might call them
the adolescence of technic civilization
-an age of trial and error for such men
of good will as groped toward a new and
better basis for living an age of con-
flict and greed for the short-sighted ma-
jority but an age with a peculiar hectic
brilliance of its own

  analogies to post-reformation europe
are tempting but should not be drawn
too closely

  what is of interest now is that at the
time of the revolution some of the insti-
tute chiefs and their followers decamped
to save their own lives they had man-
aged to seize an ecological-iinit space-
ship-it was the old starshine in orbit
around earth after completing the third
expedition to neptune-and had taken
it into outer space

  no one knew why they did not go to
mars or venus as many of their col-
leagues did nor was it known what had
become of them

  mankind in general had too much else
to think about to worry over a few hun-
dred refugees

vii

  mi olitics lyell said when
davenant told him what he had discov-
ered we stay out of this

  even if theres a-danger asked
yuan if the psychotechs get this sys-
tem organized just the way they want
it could well become a menace to the
status quo

  as a scientist of sorts you ought to
be pretty sympathetic to the psycho-
techs reorted lyel

  maybe maybe we need their skills
could be earths made her biggest mis-
take to date in booting them out on
the other hand-i dont know yuan
frowned unhappily

  i think i follow you said yaniaga-
ta groups organizations tend to lose
sight of their original purposes dont
they the means to an end become an
end in themselves look oh say at the
christian church it started with a no-
ble ideal maybe the noblest man has ever
seen a universal brotherhood of love
after a few centuries it was burning peo-
ple alive for disputing its authority
that took longer than you think
said lyell but i wont quibble it
may well be that psychotech people have
become embittered and fanatical their
connivance at political murder today
suggests it nevertheless we dont let
on that we have any inkling theyre here
we proceed as usual report the facts se-
cretly to the abbey and let the coordi-
nator and council decide what to do if
the engineers dont stay out of affairs
such as this theyll end up as exactly the
same kind of power-grabbing intriguing
bunch of crooks our job is to keep the
scientific spirit alive to reform planets
not people

  of course said falkenhorst the
abbey will want more facts than just the
bare statement that-

  yes yes keep your eyes open but
dont go playing spy you havent the
training or aptitude and the cincs are
experts

  so are the psychotects observed
the snows of ganymede	

kruse you realize lhat everything
weve said in basic fondly imagining no
one understood it is known to them

  uh-huh from now on we keep the
wiper going permanently in here let
them wonder why also its about time
we started demonstrating a few things
we can do  

  the announcement that weller was
dead and that halleck was the new
cinc- came toward the end of the holy
time an added twenty-four hours of
circus proclaimed to celebrate the acces-

by the policy makers the jovian rulers
a curiously innocent breed in spite of
their mercilessness could not be expect-
ed to know just how powerful the exec-
utive secretary of a committee was for
instance especially if that man had the
sense to be unobtrusive about it

  this also would explain why garson
had so casually accepted the engineers
feats of instant comprehension and mem-
orization during their studies to him
that was the least part of mental train-
ing

theres more to
it than jiist
clothes stupid i

sion the sergeants took it stolidly
they must be used to such sudden chan-
ges of masters

  davenant continued his fact-finding in
the library since he wanted to see which
of the angels normally there excused
themselves to attend the special confer-
ence it was a shock when garson was
among them that fumbling blushing
stammering nonentity 

  on second thought it fitted the psy-
cotechs werent interested in an outward
show of power they concentrated on
getting into key subordinate positions-
the men who gathered data and wrote re-
ports the men whose advice was valued

  but had he then invited davenant to
the service with the idea of having him
witness the assassination if so why

  while the angel was absent the engi-
neer took the opportunity to look up the
historical files there wasnt much about
the original settlers of callisto they had
merely claimed to be adherents of the
outlawed technic party who had tried to
establish themselves on the satellite and
had failed because there werent enough
skilled spacejacks among them

nphey had joined the ganymedeans
a under an agrement which gave them
all angel status permitted familiar con-
	startling stories

tracts to remain in force and left their
big ship their own personal property
that must have taken shrewd negotia-
tion but of course their leaders had been
experts some had soon been given
cine rank and the younger generation
among them was beig raised in the ortho-
dox jovian manner

  still davenant was pretty sure that
they arranged for their own children to
be pickcd for special training and for
their women to get the more privileged
jobs there was no secret police here
for the society was too rigid to require
one a close-knit brand of conspirators
could maintain itself without much trou-
ble

  now that he knew what to look for
davenant could easily find the signs of
their influence there had been some
radical changes quietly made in the past
twenty-five years the sergeants were
no longer an undifferentiated mass but
had been divided into grades of which
the higher echelons got a respectable
though strictly utilitarian education

  the newer outposts had been organ-
ized under different lines from x and
from each other one was staffed entire-
ly by sergeants who had a regular fam-
ily life another bv experimental mutant
types still another by angels and all un-
der the very eye of the church a diver-
isty of cultures was breeding which must
in time clash with and destroy the
churchs petrified overlordship the ter-
raforming project itself was probably a
psychotech idea

  so far so good davenant had every
sympathy with the notion of undermi-
ning jovian society but he wasnt at
all sure about the ultimate aims of its
new hidden masters

some three earth days later the engi-
neers went out into the field they
didnt bother unloading their ship but
jetted her directly to the camp site a
feat of piloting which must have made
some eyes bulge

  a party of angels and sergeants with
a few cine bosses and their hounds ar-
rived by motor sled to find camp already

being established it was a whirl of
movement and action with a score of
swift sleek robot machines erecting
shelters and workshops guided only by
men at the main control boards

  yre gonna drill here garson asked
timidly

  lyell nodded i think this is a prom-
ising site for one of the h-li burners
well take cores down to a depth of fifty
kilometers and find out for certain

  fifty garson gulped wont a
shaft that deep-yu have to make it
pretty wide too-wont it cave in

  not in this gravty and with this type
of rock said lyell anyway itll only
be wide at the bottom otherwise just
broad enough to lower parts which our
robots can assemble down there itll
take longer to warm the surface with the
fires burned that deep but be far more
economical in the long run also right
now we still have to find out just how
much native heat there is at the satellite
center and how available it is

  a self-operating dozer walked around
a selected area scooping away rubble
with casual giant shrugs a slim steel
skeleton rose above it and davenant and
kruse hooked in the boring rig and a
minimal nuclear engine they could have
done it faster if their jovan subordinates
had been trained for such work

  falkenhorst set up hi furnaces in one
of the workshops and began turning out
synthetic diamonds for drill bits yama-
gatas laboratory worked overtime an-
alyzing the sections brought up yuan
pored over the results and anounced that
a biological approach to the atmosphere
problem was not impossible

  of course we cant mutate from pro-
toplasmic life he said theoretically
we could make animals but theyd have
to have heat-producing cells to keep
from freezing solid and we want unicel-
lular organisms than can multiply like
mad rather than wait till the satellite
is warm enough im going to have the
abbey labs turn out some different
things which can live here as conditions
are getting rid of the poisons and releas-
ing oxygen as natural metabolic func-
the snows of ganymede	

tions liquid ammonia in place of water
for instance

  y mean yall can make life gar-
son sounded shocked and davenant
reflected what a good actor he was the
datum could hardly have been unknown
to him for synthetic virus antedated the
humanist rebellion by more than a cen-
tury and a half

  sure yuan peered at him from a
stack of calculations whole bacteria
were assembled long ago it was just
a matter of reproducing and accelerating
the chain of physicochemical reactions
which led to the first life on earth opa-
rin had sketched that out as far back as
 or so nowadays we can tailor
synthetic bacteria and protozoa to almost
any requirements the uniting factor is
merely the extremes of temperature be-
tween which such complex reactions as
make up life will go on he smiled
nothing more than microscopic organ-
isms have been made yet and i see no
reason why humans should ever be pro-
duced synthetically even if it is possible
nature has a much more intersting way
of achieving that result

  the cine who was with them looked
doubtful it souns blasphemous he
muttered only god-

  oh call it straight organic chemistry
if you want to snapped yuan just
dont bother me now ive got work to
do

  the cine flushed darkly and daven-
ant could almost read his thoughts-you
damn slant-eyed-

  garson stammered a question which
deftly turned the talk into safer chan-
nels

  well have to set up an iron mine
near here declared lyell you under-
stand that our construction is only a por-
table testing rig and that most of the ter-
raforming materials   have to be man-
ufactured on this world according to
your maps theres a deposit not far off
   lets assemble some workers and go
take a look

  the look involved driving shafts kil-
ometers into a mountain blasting was
of little value in the tenuous atmosphere

and davenant used atomic energy to melt
rocks loose after which the diggers lum-
bered monstrously to clear away the rub-
bish

  how dyou control the reaction
inquired garson i never thought any-
bodyd ever make atomic burners that
small

  damping fields said davenant ab-
stractedly anti-radiation fields too
its the same development of wave me-
chanics as has produced the molar poten-
tial barrier and the frictioinless wheel-
drive in principle these gadgets tap
some of the reaction energy to control
the reaction itself through field baffles
lead shielding is obsolete except for spe-
cial ntirposes

  oh garsons eyes rested on da-
venant behind the face-plate his coun-
tenance was a mask so y can damp
shut off a reaction from outside

  of course how else could we burn
say hydrogen and lithium instead of just
blowing them up

  the team went on to another site ly-
ell used the opportunity to go into space
and check with instruments

  a big ship there in a low orbit all
right he said must be the starshine
shes cold as charity too no one
aboard

  emergency exit for our psychotech
friends guessed kruse no point in
leaving her there rather than breaking
her up for scrap unless slies fully
equipped so when they came to cal-
listo they must have had ganymede in
mind all the time

  yamagato nodded these people
never did anything at random when the
debacle came they must have figured
their best chance to get back in the sad-
dle lay through jupiter mars and venus
have too much contact with earth for
them to operate secretly

  but the people who came out here-
began davenant they knew theyd
never live to see their plans mature why
that tremendous sacrifice for a time long
after they were dead

  people are that way said yuan
  what worries me is their ultimate
	startling stories

plans said falkenhorst those here
now must realize that theyve little or
no chance of persuading the inner plan-
ets to reinstate them by using sweet
reasonableness or even some obscure so-
cio-economic manipulation and the in-
stitute did advise war from time to time
as the best solution like when they got
the old un to put down the venusian
nationalists by force i have an uneasy
notion they plan to make jupiter a-
prussian state and then under the guise
of jovian conquest    with modern
weapons it wouldnt be pretty whether
they won or lost

  kruse said they always preached
against war except as a last resort the
venusian campaign was a small affair i
ought to know-my great-great-grand-
father was a un marine who fought
there and settled down afterward

  but attitudes change declared lyell
the psychodynamic techniques are only
methods for attaining given ends they
say nothing about the desirability of any
aim if the institute people have ac-
quired an old-fashioned power hunger
theyll rationalize it to themselves but
theyll be as dangerous as any would-be
conqueror he shrugged out of our
province though

the initial survey took a little over
three months then the expedition
returned to x to make preliminary eval-
uations of data and plan the attack on
callisto terraforming ganymede cer-
tainly looked possible the question still
was whether or not jovian society was
able to avail itself of the possibility the
answer to that involved further sociolog-
ical study

  if the psychotechs think it can be
done im inclined to agree with them
and let it go at that said kruse they
know this moon better than we ever
will

  lyell shook his head in the first
place we have to keep up the pretense
of not realizing the true situation he
replied it could mean trouble if they
found out that we do know in the sec-
ond place the abbey would want an in-

dependent opinion anyway in the third
place how do you know they want the
job done our trying and failing might
he what they really have in mind it
could have a psychological impact a dis-
appointment and bitterness which they
could very well exploit

  davenant felt again a chill of fore-
boding he wasnt fitted for this atmos-
phere of unsureness and hostility and
dark cross-currents a wave of home-
sickness for the clean bare slopes of lu-
na and the comradeship of the abbey
nearly overwhelmed him

  he wondered what the cine spies
thought of their suddenly blanked re-
corders the natural interpretation
would be that the engineers had discov-
ered the hidden instruments and had
simply chosen this means to express in-
dignation but how natural was the
jovian mind

  he returned to the library there was
little he could do at present except soak
up as many facts as possible for the ac-
ademys experts to take from him later
and the long quiet chamber was the
only place in x he really liked

  garson looked up from a projector as
he came in there was no one else
present god with us he said shyly

  davenant nodded and sat down next
to him wrhat are you studying now
he asked

  im sposed to be educating myself in
metallurfric theory so i can work better
with vour team fraid its not my strong
point

  davenant looked at the projector it
had what seemed like an unnecessary
number of controls why those he
asked pointing

  oh thats t save spools one tape
can hold a lot o diffrent texts same as
one phone line can carry a lot of diffrent
messages these buttons are t unscram-
ble select the one i want

  hmmm- davenant hoped his ex-
citement didnt show thats a novel
idea when did it come in

  oh bout fifteen tweny years ago
why

  j-j-i- davenant swore at himself
the snows of ganymede	

and brought his tongue under control i
was just wondering

  but he knew now where the psyco-
techs kept their secret records right
here with all the others safely scrambled
in with a code modulation known only to
the conspirators best place on gany-
mede 

  the angel sighed and looked at him
steadily you know dont you he
murmured-in basic

  know- for an instant davenant
failed to understand what garson meant
then shock held him rigid

  the angel smiled why bother
hall it sticks out ten kilometers ever
since you started blanking those spy ma-
chines and some of your questions the
way you react to key statments almost
the way you walk you know who we
are

  you-i dont get it what do you
mean 

  never mind this isnt a very safe
place to discuss such things just tell the
others what ive said and quote me to
the effect that we dont care it was fore-
seen that a group of alert intelligent out-
siders coming here especially to study
this place would most likely discover our
secret the probable reaction of your or-
der has already been estimated and al-
lowed for i -wanted you to see that re-
ligious ceremony and assassination to
realize more fully what a brutalized cul-
ture this is and how right that it should
be taken over and changed

  the mask was off there was no more
hesitation no more awkwardness in
garson it was a mature and calmly as-
sured man who spoke

  i know weve been party to some
nasty affairs like the last change of dic-
tators well continue in that line for a
while because we must just remember
that our ultimate aim is still what it al-
ways was-to establish sanity so firmly
in all men that that sort of thing will be
forgotten and impossible

  davenant sat unmoving garson re-
turned quietly to his book

  it mieht have been minutes later or
nearly an hour when the tramp of boots
rang in the corridor outside davenant

glanced up from the screen which he had
been mechanically studying and saw the
door fly open a dozen hounds made
their entry long low-gee jumps ranged
them around the wall with guns pointing
inward a black-clad cinc- followed
them

  dont move he said youre ar-
rested

  what davenant leaped erect
three staring muzzles followed him
what in sol-

  hands up snapped the cine con-
spiracy gainst the church s is a killin
matter 

tvavenant sucked in his breath
u and willed steadiness back to his
shaking form his mind leaped with an
unnatural clarity

  you cant arrest me he said im a
planetary engineer our contract with
your government which has the force of
a treaty gives us immunity

  cant i though

  davenant shrugged a tiny germ of
panic crawled deep in his skull but his
voice lifted coldly

  the order protects its own if you
molest me in any fashion theyll hear of
it at once on luna we have our meth-
ods of communication

  sheer bluff but he counted on the sci-
entific illiteracy of the cinc class and the
awe which his teams work in the field
had produced how would you like to
have your brain burned out from space
he went on what defense have you
against robot bombs sent clear from lu-
na if you dont let me go back to my
quarters youll soon find out that the or-
der is not helpless

  for a moment the cinc hesitated
don do it screamed garson theres
women an children here

  that worked the cinc detailed three
hounds to escort davenant back to his
suite

  four of the other engineers were al-
ready there kruse showed up later
arrogantly demanding that the guards
outside the door let him in he had been
set on by three hounds down in the main
power room but he had also been in-


startling stories

volved in clan feuds on venus as a
youngster from his tunic he extracted
guns and passed them around

  what brought it on groaned yuan
whats happened

  ive got a hunch davenant set up
his testing rig and checked the room cir-
suits again yeah hallecks idea ill
bet hes not stupid see this pip
thats a metallic mass in the adjoining
suite which wasnt there before when
we started wiping his tapes he must have
set up an old-fashioned groove-cutting
mechanical recorder hes heard every-
thing

  and we thought we were safe and
didnt bother to speak basic most of the
time mumbled yuan he must be
pretty damn sure of the situation so
now hes setting out to arrest all the
psycotechs on ganymede and us along
with them

  what will happen to us wondered
falkenhorst sweat beaded his face but
the voice held an iron calm will they
dare take action against members of the
order

  probably said lyell in a thin tone
were safer for him dead-we know
too much he may call halls bluff and
execute us officially more likely fake
an accident he scowled what to
do

  kruse shrugged his face was taut
and pale but he spoke with a sharp note
of laughter

  weve got three guns he said
were used to higher gravity than this
we can catch those sons of hounds out-
side by surprise pick up whatever
equipment here you think well need
the only thing for us is to break out of
here

  there was only a moments hesitation
as they weighed the meaning lyell
nodded i hate to do it but    lets
s

  he kruse and yuan the best shots
took the weapons the rest loaded equip-
ment on their backs kruse flattened
himself against the door and opened it
just enough to peer out into the faces of
three hounds

  boo he said

  the nearest guard scowled and
reached for his gun kruse snapped
three shots

  come on he yelled and flung the
door wide

  the engineers burst out into the cor-
ridor stumbling over the bodies dave-
nant stooped to pick up a gan for himself
and heard the whine of a bullet cleaving
the air where he had stood a corps of
hounds was trotting down toward them

  out of here roared lyell

  they backed laying down a curtain
of fire it seemed a miracle that there
were no hits but they were distant mov-
ing targets davenant wasnt afraid now
he hadnt time to be he burst around a
corner almost into the arms of another
jovian guard

his fist leaped of itself the blow
shocked home and he saw the man
lurch back with his face red coldly
davenant kicked him in the belly and
behind the ear as he went down

  run his breath was raw in his throat
as he fled with the others down an end-
less labyrinth always down toward the
garages he didnt see the action behind
him as the three gunners turned to fire
back once falkenhorse staggered
grabbing at a shoulder which was sud-
denly wet davenant threw an arm
around the mans waist and they strug-
gled on together

  now-the garage entrance in the
confusion it was unwatched the engi-
neers went through closing the massive
door and dogging -it behind them a
couple of mechanics ran up to protest
kruse waved his gun

  back or you get it in the guts he
snarled

  there was a long row of sleek small
rockets ready and waiting lyell en-
tered the nearest

  kruse davenant yamagata aft to
the engines he clipped the rest stay
with me be ready to take over piloting
if i dont last

  i hope those mechs stay buffaloed
kruses teeth flashed white weve
used up all our ammunition you know
his big form wriggled into the crowded
the snows of ganymede



engine room

  where the devil will we go to
asked yamagata this boat isnt inter-
planetary

  i dont know the outlaws in the
hills i reckon if we can find them
what counts right now is getting clear
of x

  the auxiliary motors purred turning
the rockets wheels it slipped down the
corridor and up the airlock ramp it was
useful having enemies indoctrinated out
of all initiative no one had thought to
cut off the automatically opening valves

  as the boat emerged into dark bitter-
ness lyell saw space-suited forms
swarming across the ground

  not a chance to get to the light he
said stand by to lift

  the rockets flared tossing the boat
skyward lyell headed north switched
on the autopilot and began scrambling
into one of the space suits the rest did
the same none was a particularly good
fit-a suit should really be individually
built-but they would do

  stars glittered in the forward view-
ports falkenhorst slumped with closed
eyes color drained from his face yuan
studied the radarscope his voice floated
back to the thrumming hotness of the
engine room over the intercom
someone coming after us

  yes i see him now police rocket
and this thing hasnt a gun to its name
lyells voice held a groan

  davenant did not see what happened
he felt the sudden shock and thunder
felt the hull reel around him and drop
like a murdered seraph air whistled
through the hole amidships and the un-
balance gyros howled

  hang on bellowed kruse slapping
down his helmet hang on and pray
they struck with a -sundering crash
which jerked davenants head almost off
his neck darkness whirled before his
eyes

  when he came out of it kruse was
looking emptily through the engine-room
door

  theyre gone he said it killed
them

  slowly davenant crawled from the

ruin the boat had come down in a long
glide smashing itself into a land of bare
mountains and reaching snowfields the
three men forward were dead

  yamagata went out through the hole
torn in the boats waist and looked sky-
ward a distant red flare streaked south

  they arent landing he said be
almost impossible to do in this country
and theyll be needed at home and wont
figure on any survivors lasting long
which we wont kruse answered
dully

  we can try rebellion lifted in
davenant and brought his head erect
well lay these men out as well as we
can and then-

  yes asked kruse what then
we start walking said davenant   

  that was how it had started now
davenant and kruse stepped and glided
two dead men walking across the face of
hell

viii

t

-m he gauges said that about thirty
minutes oxygen remained if it had not
been for yamagata davenant and kruse
would have suffocated already they
could stretch out their lives by sitting
still but there was no point to that

  a ragged edge of hills cut across the
face of jupiter like teeth of blackness
their shadows streamed enormous be-
fore them hard and sharp over the bro-
ken ground outside the shadows there
was a rush of light from the primary
chill amber which sparkled frostil- off
solid ammonia fields and flashed from
the ice glaciers in another sawbacked
range when jupiter was close to full
its radiance was enough for human color
vision though the hues had a dreamlike
distortion

  near the banded giant no stars were
visible they were drowned out when
you looked away you could see them
over the sharply curving horizon they
glittered through the tenuous unbreath-
able air with a cruel wintry brilliance

  even carrying his own weight of suit
oxygen bottles capacitors and other


startling stories

equipment a man was light when gravity
was less than a fifth of earths you
learned walking all over again the first
time you were on a low-gee world-a
long flat glide which ate the kilometers

  you learned to gauge distances when
thin air made an object seem closer than
it was while a near horizon tried to
make it seem farther you learned to
check every joint and valve and connec-
tion on your suit before venturing out
when the least failure could choke you
explode you freeze you solid in minutes

  and you learned to have death for a
companion

  the minds of the two surviving engi-
neers had grown so dim with the steady
slogging that when the gunshot came it
almost killed them davenport saw a
spurt of snow and chipped ice before his
feet and stared at it in a dull kind of
wonder he didnt hear anything except
the whisper of wind past his helmet for
the air was too lean another slug
pocked the low bluff to his right

  down yelled kruse theyre
shooting at us

  he nosedived for the ground and a
bullet whipped past the spot where he
had stood davenant followed a move-
ment of blind instinct ammonia-crvs-
tal snow feathered up to blind his face-
plate he pawed at it while his body tried
to dig itself into rock

  kruce touched helmets with him
radio silence man they may have a
direction finder weve got to speak by
conduction now this way- he led
an awkward belly-crawl toward the near-
est of the little craters which scarred the
valley floor

  davenant shuddered for a moment
he was uncontrollably afraid his muscles
knotted immovably against the expected
leaden blow then the very condition of
hysteria triggered reactions which had
been built into his mind during his long
training suddenly he was without fear
his body keved to a hieh adrenal pitch
his thoughts like cold lightning at night
he slipped after kruse and wallowed
dnwn into the fluffy snow which filled the
crater

  the venusian hunched low snarling

into the empty sky if they pin us here
for another half hour were done he
said

  a black outline showed above a ridge
of ice just for a second before ducking
down again

  cincs asked kruse have they
tracked us down after all 

  davenant considered no if that
were a cinc wed be dead by now hed
have an infra-red scope on his rifle and
even with our heaters tuned down to
where im glad im not a brass monkey
wed show up like a bonfire against this
temperature

  the big man blinked a little surprised
at davenants coolness it would have
surprised davenant too if he had had
time he was fumbling with his pack
getting out the general unit which the
discipline of years had made him carry
from the wreck general units were ex-
pensive and engineers were supposed to
save money for the order whenever it
was humanly possible

  outlaws then said kruse and
how the devil were going to convince
them were friendly

slowly davenants thick-fingered
gloves worked on the unit plugging
in jacks and turning dials it ran off
his own capacitors and took its time
about warming up in the ganymedean
chill

  he answered kruse abstractedly
were not friendly with the outlaw
you know were only trying to estab-
lish contact out of desperation and-
a flicker appeared on the screen here
we go

  a man in the field who might have
to work hundreds of kilometers from
camp couldnt pack twenty different
meters and detectors he needed a single
device rugged and portable which could
be adjusted to perform twenty different
functions

  davenant had simply connected the
thermopile with the galvanometer blin-
kered the lens to provide sharp direc-
tionality and come up with an infra-red
spotter it wouldnt directly show men
crouched behind rock and ice but it
the snows of ganymede	

would show rising currents of air heated
by their suits cautiously he swept it
around the horizon

  two he said after a minute ones
sitting over in back of that ridge the
other circling behind us i think he wants
to get a vantage point from the top of
that bluff and shoot down at us now
any ideas

  mmmm-yeah lets get the cir-
cler his friend wont be able to see what
happens we can get up on the bluff fast
and wait for him

  a fevy minutes later the outlaw-he
could be no other-crept over a final rise
and toward a position where he could
look down into the valley a large form
sprang on him from a crag pinioning
him another leaped at the same time
from the nearly impenetrable shadow of
a cave grabbed the leads from his ca-
pacitors and yanked them out before
he could send a cry for help

  the man struggled wildly it was hard
for kruse to hold him here where weight
counted for so little davenant got out
his pliers and unscrewed the short aerial
of the outlaws helmet radio only then
did he plug the capacitors back into the
suit circuit

  kruses helmet was tight against his
prisoners we dont want to cut off
your juice permanently and freeze you
he said but we might have to unless
you behave yourself    get his gun
hall

  davenant could not hear that but he
had already picked up the weapon to
his surprise he saw that it wasnt a rifle
after all but some kind of bolt-ac-
tion smooth-bore obviously home-made
though it used percussion caps he cov-
ered the outlaw until kruse got some
wire and bound the mans ankles togeth-
er then the venusian took the gun and
stood up

  im going after the other fellow he
said

  isnt that - dangerous objected
davenant

  of course but look at your oxy
gauge we havent got many minutes
left at the rate weve been using the
stuff and ive had stalking experience

back home which i doubt you have see
if you can talk this one over

   the tall figure slipped down the ridge
and was lost to sight

  davenant huddled beside the captive
touching helmets he heard only hoarse
breathing for awhile and looked into a
gaunt hook-nosed face nearly hidden by
long tangled hair and beard the suit
he noticed was an old model and bore
signs of much handmade repair

  the outlaw subsided a little he
could have thrown his arms around
davenant but he could not have held
the engineer for long he sat back with
animal patience to wait for a better
chance

  who are ye  he asked his english
was barbarously accented but clear
enough be ye gardam cincs

  no the cincs were after us we
were looking for an outlaw community
where we can get help were men of
the planetary engineers

  that conveyed nothing to the man but
he nodded erudgingly yere no jovian
i see earth

  only in a way my order exists
apart from any planet we work for all
but the cincs hunted us down anyway
davenant paused decided a half-truth
was his best bet we want revenge on
them perhaps your people can help
mebbe new cine trick it was a
savage growl with a lifetimes bitterness
in the words

  we want to be shown to your vil-
lage let us talk to your chief or who-
ever-

  no die first

tavenant smiled nastily i dont
see any signs of motor transport
he said so you must have walked from
your home you must have at least
enough oxy to get back on if necessary
well take your bottles for ourselves and
follow your trail rut wed rather let you
guide us

  not enough oxy we got caches ye
never find ye die too

  at least said davenant mildly
well die trying he was faintly sur-
prised at his own ruthlessness but the
	startling stories

order came first more persuasively he
went on what harm can it do if you
guide us what could two men do
against a whole village we have news
for your chief which will make him glad
you have nothing to lose

  the outlaw lapsed into a sullen si-
lence

  after awhile kruse came back prod-
ding another man before him

  i sneaked behind and got the drop
on thisn he explained now what
should we do

  davenant examined the weapon taken
from the new captive it was a sort of
spring-steel crossbow shooting metal
quarrels in this gravity and air pres-
sure such a device would have plenty of
range it could easily pierce a suit of
space armor and the man within it the
main drawback would be the low rate of
fire

  his respect for the outlaws went up
another notch

  first he said we lake these boys
spare oxy bottles for ourselves my airs
getting thick then we talk them into
guiding us or if they wont we leave
them here

  it took some persuasion before an
argreement was reached but then the
trek got started once the men tried to
lead them astray but kruse who had
spotted the faint signs of their earlier
passage forced them back onto the true
trail

  it was a long walk and davenant felt
weak with hunger toward its end he
thrust the awareness out of his mind and
whipped his flagging body into new ener-
gy once they stopped at a carefully
disguised cairn and took out some fresh
oxygen containers there must be a lot
of caches spotted throughout this coun-
try

  that would explain how the outlaw
patrols managed to range so far

  davenant wondered with a certain
chill what would happen when they
reached the village he had heard stories
about these barbarians which even al-
lowing for exaggeration by their ene-
mies were not reassuring

ix

ear the north pole of ganymede
the godwin mountains rose steep and
cragged tormented black walls which
shimmered darkly under the radiance of
jupiter a monster system of glaciers
capped them spilling down gashed ra-
vines and across the lower plateaus the
yellow light was cold on their slippery
backs

  kruse davenant and their prisoners
halted between two peaks which thrust
above the ice and covered them with
shadow a slope fell away beneath them
to a narrow craterlike depression and
on it they could see the outlines of hu-
man figures

  lets go muttered kruse

  no one of the captives spoke in
a harsh whisper services goin on
sentries d shoot tis first check later
we gotta wait

  squinting against the chill unreal haze
of jupiter-light davenant saw that the
people below were drawn up in ranks
facing a block of native stone where half
a dozen worshipers were going through
ritual gestures poking his helmet aerial
forward and tuning up his radio he
caught faintly a deep-voiced chant

  god-home god-home hear our askin

see we stand with sacrifice-

  shocked he looked southward and up
to the enormous face of the planet it
was at the full now sprawling tremen-
dously across heaven the red spot like
a single watching eye

  is that your god he breathed

  god is in jupe and jupe is in god
answered the barbarian with a peculiar
note of reverence in his voice

  o	zeus could you know davenant
imagined olympian laughter ringing
hoarsely through the mountains

  they caught a man in the last raid on
y said one ofthe prisoners look

  they could see a man struggling in
the grip of four others a tiny puff of
freezing vapor came from him he went
the snows of ganymede	

limp and was hurled up on the altar
stone davenant retched

tjorcing his mind back toward an
impersonal clarity he wondered about
the development of outlaw culture
how long ago had their revolt and exo-
dus taken place-eight years  that
didnt seem like time enough for this
much degeneration

  but then ganymede wasnt earth
the psycho-social effect of alien condi-
tions had yet to be measured huddling
hiding waging a doomed war for three
or four generations the hillmen would
rapidly have forgotten their intricate
highly specialized civilization the bar-
renness and cold of the landscape would
have entered their souls

  he turned over what little he had
learned about them in x a religious
colony forced to alter its ways of living
and thinking in order to survive forced
yet further by prophet-dictators whose
revelations had involved radical social
change and increased their own power
yes it would be unstable it would have
its old believers

  the introduction of controlled muta-
tion had led to mutiny and civil war the
dissenters had been defeated and fled
into the wilderness there they had hid-
den skulked and raided lonely settle-
ments without books without leisure
they would rapidly have become barbari-
ans the stories about cannibalism and
human sacrifice seemed justified but
davenport tried hard not to think of
them as the monsters they were consid-
ered to be they were human beings
lonely and desperate and driven close to
madness but they had the same potential
as anyone else

  besides he thought it was pretty ob-
vious that the cincs had been pulling
their punches in the war a concerted
effort could have wiped out the hillmen
long ago but an external enemy was too
useful

  seems to be breaking up down
there observed kruse

  they wafted till the scene was desert-
ed then moved cautiously down the slope

and across the open ice one of the out-
laws spoke with a note of glee

  mights well put down yer gun
yere covered now

  sweat trickled along davenants ribs
he tried to look into the farther shad-
ows but they were too dense

  a voice in his earphones said stand
where ye be

  a quarrel chipping the glacier near his
feet added emphasis they halted and
stood waiting their hands aloft

  three men came into view weapons
leveled that ye gil fooledem here
eh good going

  we- davenant licked his lips
they felt sandy we came here on
purpose were not cincs or hounds
were from earth and we want to see
your chief

  there was a skeptical silence one of
the new arrivals picked up the dropped
gun and crossbow and touched the en-
gineer suits

  not cine make he grunted but
theyre clever devils

  all we want-

  i know i know shuddup yell get
yer chance-mebbe

  as davenant walked up the farther
ridge with guns at his back he saw half
a dozen figures appear with-brooms by
space he felt a mental wobbling until
he realized they were carefully smooth-
ing out footprints and all other trace of
the recent crowd around the altar

  there was no path slipping and
stumbling groping through blindness of
shadow and dazzled by jupiters radi-
ance the party made a slow way through
the crags it seemed a long while before
they were halted by other sentries there
was a low-voiced colloquy and then the
two engineers were herded toward a
cave mouth a great gullet of blackness in
an overhanging cliff a machine-gun
nest was due in just beyond

  the passage fell rapidly downward
a reaching gloom where flash beams were
pale fingers and echoes sounded hollowly
even in this ghost of an atmosphere
davenant could make out enough branch
tunnels to wonder how anyone ever
	startling stories

found his way here like all small rap-
idly cooling worlds ganymede was rid-
dled with caves

  after another lengthy and silent walk
they found an airlock door tt seemed to
be from a spaceship there was another
defensive emplacement before it and an-
other discussion with the guards at last
they were sent into the lock chamber
the pump was old and rickety it took a
long time to flush out ganymedes air
and replace it with a thin oxygen-rich
mixture davenports helmet frosted
over and blinded him

  awright through here -stop-take
off yer suit

tvwenant and kruse stripped
down to the form-fitting coverall
which was standard underpadding
kruse was dirty and tired skin drawn
tight across jutting bones a thick stub-
ble of red beard on his jaws

  i suppose i look just as bad thought
davenant

  there were several outlaws about
them gaunt undersized men in worn
coveralls some of them wore ornaments
-hammered copper rings in nose or
ears all carried daggers which seemed
to have been beaten out of native iron
they were more interested in the cap-
tured airsuits than in the prisoners

  how about seeing your chief asked
kruse

  take yer time muttered someone
and spat

  kruse bristled look here he
snapped i told you we were from
earth in fact were planetary engi-
neers you probably dont know what
that means but believe me its impor-
tant we have word for your chief which
hell be glad to hear but if you dont
treat us right the order has means to
make you do it

  that seemed to impress them a little
one of them traced a grimy finger over
the suit apparently impervious to the
chill which was still on its exterior

  not ganny make he said mebbe
they be really from earth he spoke
as a man at home might have spoken of
avalon

  no weapons said one of the two
whom the engineers had taken

  of course not davenant said lofti-
ly i tell you we belong to the order
do you think wre need to lug hand guns
around

  well- a tollman scratched his
tangled whiskers all right come
along

  two others fell in behind with cocked
crossbows the rest trailed after their
eyes lit by a dull curiosity

the caves and tunnels here had been
a little improved save that fluoros were
strung to illuminate them davenant de-
cided that a section of the caverns must
simply have been blocked off with air-
locks installed here and there heated
and ventilated no system of tubes for
that-there must be only a few power
fans mounted near the oxygen renewal
plant the air felt dank and stagnant

  the populated section was a series of
narrow tunnels in which shallow caves
had been chipped or blasted ragged
curtains served for doors when one or
two of these were drawn aside as some-
one came out davenant saw a pathetic
bareness within a few boxes or stones
for furniture the dwarfish near-naked
women and children who swarmed and
chattered around the convoy seemed un-
necessarily dirty behold the noble sav-
age

  cant be more than a few thousand
muttered kruse  is this all the outlaws
there are

  i suppose so answered davenant
i heard in x that there were several
such villages once but that only one was
believed still to survive if the cincs
didnt get them something went wrong
with the air plant or the power or-

  his revulsion was becoming an enor-
mous pity they couldnt even surren-
der these poor starveling troglodytes
x had no use for them except as a unify-
ing ineffectual enemy

  further along they passed a commu-
nal kitchen steam pipes from the nu-
clear plant bad been laid to heat food
which seemed to be mostly synthetics

  the passage debouched on a wide
the snows of ganymede



cavern at whose farther end was a real
door native iron a clumsy idol of black
stone loomed before it and two men
armed with modern rifles-presumably
stolen-lounged nearby on guard there
was a jabbering conference and one of
the sentries ducked inside

  kruse switched to basic to speak to
davenant have you any idea what
were going to tell the grand high pan-
jandrum he asked

  depends on what hes like said
davenant it had better be good
though or well end up in a stewpot
the guardsman reappeared in he
grunted as several pressed behind of-
fering to cover the prisoners he ordered
no just them two

  when the door clashed shut davenant
had to struggle to suppress his astonish-
ment the chief seemed to own a suite
several rooms formed by plastiboard par-
titions there were carpets on the floors
chairs and tables a shelf of books the
man who stood before them was tall for
an outlaw his long gray-shot hair and
beard was neatly combed his coverall
faded but clean three women pre-
sumably wives scuttled out of sight

  there was a silence from earth
asked the outlaw ruler at last

  yes davenant moved forward

  a pistol leaped into the mans hand
easy he warned

  we dont intend violence said
davenant we jumped your scouts be-
cause they attacked us but spared their
lives all were after is a chance to talk
to you

  awright im roberts-john boss o
jupiter city come in an siddown
the chief led the way to a sort of living
room found himself a chair and clapped
his hands ofte of the women brought in
a tray of water and synth-dough

  it was a shaking effort to nibble se-
dately at the food instead of wolfing it
the chief asked the engineers their
names and went on to some shrewd ques-
tions about the inner planets then he
came to the point

  whyre ye here

  there was-trouble with the cincs

said davenant he was faintly surprised
that he should take the lead but kruse
was sitting back and saying nothing eyes
half shut with weariness we have to
get in touch with the abbey-with our
order the engineers so we came look-
ing for your people to help us

  lucky chance for ye said roberts-
john yed never a found the city
thout our men to guide its well hid

davenant drew him out on that
subject he learned that the origi-
nal mutineers had fled in some of the
smaller spaceships after wrecking others
which might have been used for pursuit
the old american had long ago been
broken up to help build x

  now and th mi outlaw outposts
had had to fight th itnums of the lord
-the warrior corps wh h had since been
recruited from exogere-who had come
in ground vehicles but the confusion
left after the mutiny and the hmage
done by it had given time enough to
establish this village and hide it well
the nuclear power plant of the space-
ship in which this colonys founder had
arrived had been moved underground-
compact and shielded as it had been that
had meant a heart-breaking job-to
furnish energy likewise her chemical
air renewer had been removed indeed
most of the vessel had been utilized a
food-synthesis unit had been taken along
as well as other equipment

  ice had been mined some of it elec-
trolyzed for oxygen in general the
builders of jupiter city had repeated the
pattern which had made x although on
a smaller scale and under immensely
greater difficulties raids had later fur-
nished more materials fuel for the atom-
ic engine tools fabrics weapons sup-
plemental food

  this place radiated heat but not
enough to be detectable through the over-
lying rocks and glaciers tt contained
plenty of metal but scattered iron de-
posits confused magnetic locators as for
visible surface traces-ganymede was
large and the godwin country some of
the wildest and most nigged on the satel-
lite
	startling stories

  davenant could fill in a good deal of
history for himself he had read how
the first generation here had been skilled
engineers but because of the shortage
of books the impossibility of proper in-
struction most of their knowledge had
died with them hereditary monarchy
had been inevitable-one family sup-
ported by die rest with leisure to learn
by rote the operation and servicing of
the machinery on which life depended
with an intelligence sharpened enough
to make basic decisions the rest merely
obeyed orders and spent their lives in a
dullness relieved only by work fighting
and the orgies which followed victory

  they had their religion-which had
been corrupted into sheer paganism-
their taboos a few songs and stories
their dimming traditions otherwise
there was nothng

  id like to see your power plant
said davenant that sort of thing was
my special job at home without expert
care it will sooner or later fail a
bribe

  roberts-john seemed to know it was
what dye want of us he demanded
again sposin we greed t help ye
what cd we do

  that said davenant bleakly is
what i am wondering

x

kruse spoke up then and told of
all that had been happening to the sur-
vey party of engineers roberts-jolin
nodded saying little how much of it
he really understood was a question

  davenant felt a stinging in his eyes
lyell falkenhorst yuan yamagata
they had all been so close and dear to
him and now they lay dead in the snow
they sprawled frozen on the face of the
moon their burst eyes gaping sightlessly
at jupiter and the great wheel of stars
their bodies were blocks of ice their
brains held only a hollow and everlasting
darkness farewell my brothers

  davenant shoved such thought away
time later to mourn he was still alive
and he had a mission he had eaten and

drunk in this oddly civilized home of a
barbarian king and now he had to start
planning

  ye can jine with us suggested
roberts-jolin we can always use a
tech mebbe when your friends come
from earth ye can get in touch with
em

  kruse rubbed his chin how about
that hall  i cant say i fancy turning
cave dweller for the next one to five
years but it may be the only way

  davenant shook his head it did not
occur to him that he had taken the lead-
ership but there it was again

  not good enough he said the
cincs may destroy this nest at any time
or they may decide to abandon the terra-
forming idea which presumably origi-
nated with the psychotechs in which
case well never get off this moon its
more than us torvald though god
knows i dont want to play hero the
abbey has to be told how can the ab-
bey plan if it doesnt have the facts

  kruse gave him a sour grin all
right then what do you plan on do-

inr

  lets first take a look at your power
plant here chief roberts suggested
davenant im not sure i like those
occasional flickers in the lighting

  kruse showed a moments surprise
he knew as well as the younger engi-
neer that the cause was nothing worse
than a faulty turbogenerator clamping
expressionlessness onto his face he
nodded and rose

  i think hall may be right he said
noncommittally

  roberts-john looked alarmed and led
the way out and through a descending
series of tunnels davenants general
unit adjusted to geiger registry showed
more radiation than there ought to be
though not enough for real worry faul-
ty shielding

  he traced that quickly some of the
lead blocks in front of the reactor had
slipped perhaps in one of the frequent
moonquakes caused by the tidal pull of
jupiter otherwise the power plant was
in fairly good shape it had been well
the snows of ganymede



constructed and had been tended with
care

  he shook his head dolefully and
glanced at the row of meters remote-
control dials and instruments do you
know what these are for he asked the
outlaw ruler

  some of em when this here needle
gets near th red line t pull out that
there rod an- the chief went on to
reveal a scanty barely adequate empiri-
cal knowledge of maintenance

  i thought so davenant pointed to
a gauge whose indicator was well past
the red it showed merely that the origi-
nal slugs were sufficiently enriched with
new isotopes to be worth removing and
replacing how long has this been that
way

  longs i cn remember ye dont
think-

  i do the hypewangle isnt dreel-
sprailing with the camits lucky for
you that the effect builds up slowly but
i wouldnt give this thing another five
years of life unless somethings done
look davenant tapped a few buttons
emergency manual cutoff needles wob-
bled across the dials and the lights went
out the chief roared and sprang for
him kruse held the frantic man back
until davenant had restored functioning

  dont do that sweat drained from
roberts-johns face and he shook un-
controllably dont do it

  i was only testing the hypostat
davenant said mildly it doesnt fan-
tangle as it should unless you let me
make some badly needed repairs youll
be frozen to death in a few years

  i-i-i- roberts-john gulped
mastering himself he asked with a sav-
age bark how d i know yere not a
cinc sent t wreck th whole town

  ill be here too davenant pointed
out give me a few clays and ill have
this thing purring 

  by the end of that time though hull
davenant was close to being the abso-
lute ruler of jupiter city the man who
straightened out the reactor fixed the
electric generator running off it and can-
nibalized a dozen dead helmet radios to

produce half as many operating ones in-
evitably would be

  roberts-john was too proud to be ob-
sequious but too intelligent to resent a
better man for the job than he was him-
self behind his mane and beard was a
clever queerly altruistic personality
davenant found it rather embarrassing to
turn down his offer of temporary wives
it wasnt morals so much as appearance
and cleanliness kruse was not fastidi-
ous

  the venusian regarded him out of a
grease-smudged face and said in the
basic they used here between themselves
nice going but now what

  now said davenant thoughtfully
wed better find a way to reach the
star shine

  huh

  of course unless you have some
scheme for recapturing the light or
grabbing xs one deep-space cruiser the
only craft in the jovian system capable
of reaching luna the psychotechs
didnt have a chance to escape with
her    how badly wrecked is that
rocket we fled in

  kruse closed his eyes and summoned
up eidetic memory maybe it could be
repaired he said at last i dont think
anything is too badly damaged of
course youre assuming the jovians
havent salvaged it yet    no i see it
now the boat runs off chemical fuel
and isnt designed to get far from the
surface even in perfect shape it couldnt
get up to the starshmes orbit thrusts
too low by a factor of-urn id say be-
tween one and a half and two

davenant slapped the shielding of
the towns reactor this baby
once ran a pretty good-sized spaceship
lots of energy there

  and i can just see our hosts letting
us take it

  not at all i was thinking of a pow-
er-beam

  huh nobodys ever run a rocket
off a povver-beam

  theres always a first time let me
think now    hows this sound  when


startling stories

you get out there with your salvage
party scrap the whole drive system and
replace it with a king-sized tank for wa-
ter a power-beam receiver and an elec-
trical hookup the idea will be to boil
water around superheated coils blow it
out the rear past an ionizing arc and use
a linac system to accelerate the ions still
further essentially a crude version of
the present-day space drive the whole
thing will run off a beam from here
naturally youll have to give the boat a
feed-back signal to keep the beam aimed
right

 that said kruse would make
good continuity for some stereo serial
but you know as well as i do that it calls
not only for construction from the
ground up but for design-and we
havent much more than a slide rule in
this place im not chief scientist young
of the junior intergalactic patrol

 you are an engineer davenant
said quietly

  they got to work

  the job was not quite as fantastic as
it sounded they were aiming only to
get off a small world with negligible air
resistance and not even to leave its
gravity well entirely the principles in-
volved were familiar to both the basic
design standard in such midget craft as
the asteroid scooter

  there was a good deal of machinery
from the outlaws original spaceship
stored away for ultimate use as scrap
the colony had no projects calling for
multi-element vacuum tubes astrogating
robopilots high-voltage arcs or a hun-
dred other parts

  davenants idea was easy to draw up
even to make some elementary calcula-
tions about more than that a planetary
engineer had training for his profession
uch as had never been seen before he
didnt have to stew for weeks before see-
ing the answer to a problem

  his subconscious mind collaborated
all the time

  in about two revolutions of ganymede
the plans were readv and the parts and
tools which would be required were
loaded up

  the main difficulty was testing there
just wouldnt be any way to get all the
bugs out

  whoever piloted that boat would have
to hope it stayed in one piece for the
few hours needed

z ruse took out a gang of men drag-
ging sleds piled high with equip-
ment and supplies davenant stayed be-
hind to supervice the construction of a
power-beamer

  when he told roberts-john what he
wanted the chief exploded

  no he cried with horror

 but-

  no twas bad enough taking so
much of our stuff for fixing that boat

  davenant had had to promise all sorts
of benefits which the order would sup-
ply in exchange but roberts-john still
shook his head

  we cant spare the men neither not
really he said somebodys got to
watch the passes leading here he
tugged at his beard now ye want to
stick up a mast thatll yell to the cincs
where we are uh-uh

  one bony hand fell to the gun at his
waist

  davenant braced himself there was
death here unless he could talk over the
chief  talk the whole outlaw popu-
lation over in fact

  tt would be removed as soon as it
had been used he countered

  spose a cine boat happens over be-
fore huh

  the engineer took a deep breath
hed rather expected this reaction now
it was time to plav his one lonely ace
and play it with a flourish

  youve seen what i can do with what
little you have here he declared slowly
thats a big ship were aiming for
crammed with equipment he was gam-
bling that she had not been gutted but
the notion that the psychotechs had kept
her for emergency use argued that her
holds were still pretty full how would
you like it if we ended the cine menace
we could do it you know

  roberts-john goggled at him tt took
a long time for davenport to put the
the snows of ganymede

 idea across   

   the beaming mast grew swiftly it
 need only be a skeleton of spare girders
 welded together according to plans the
 outlaw mechanics-after all they were
 capable of maintaining something as in-
 tricate as an airsuit-could easily follow
 the casting and controlling units took
 more work davenant almost forgot
 what sleep was like he knew exactly
 how to build a rig sufficient for his pur-
 poses but improvising the different parts
 and assembling them was a nightmarish
 task

 the caverns were in one white flame
 of excitement they had known they
 were doomed these people had known
 their long struggle was hollow the sud-
 den prospect of an end to it made them
 all a little crazy

   davenant dared not tell them what a
 fragile chain their newborn hopes de-
 pended from

   kruse returned in two revolutions
 shes ready as far as i can tell he
 said it was mostly the bows that were
 wrecked-not too much repair to do ac-
 tually rebuilding the motor was the
 tough part think coils made with a
 tolerance of fifty millimeters are going
 to work they tested better than id
 expected but-

   of course ill have to pilot in a
 space-suit we didnt stop to seal the
 cabin and put in air units but if she
 hangs together at all it ought to be pos-
 sible to ride her

   ill pilot said davenant i know
 more about electronic systems than you
 do

   mmmm-youre risking your neck
 on a mighty thin chance toss you for
 it

     they also serve who only stand and
 wait torvald roberts-john is deter-
 mined to keep one of us a hostage it
 wont be pleasant for that one if this
 fails

   kruse grimaced all right youre
 the pilot youre younger anyway faster
 reactions and this boat is going to need
 a lot of human handling to make up for
 its own deficiencies 



xi

is pace was a great frosty darkness
strewn with a million cold suns the
enormous crescent of jupiter blotted the
milky way as if drinking a jtream of
stars the sun was far and small and
heartlessly brilliant

  davenants gauntleted hands were
numb on the controls blastoff had been
automatic no space vessel can be flown
by a merely living creature and arrive
where it wants to go his part had been
only to aim her nose in the precalculated
direction punch the firing button at the
right time and hold it down the proper
number of minutes when the abused
gyros began to hunt he had had to com-
pensate with his free hand on the manual
control wheel that was all but it was
nearly enough to break him

  now the jets were dead and he was
falling upward seeking an invisible ob-
ject whose orbit had been computed
roughly from eidetic memories of incom-
plete observation if the calculations
were too rough he would eventually
spatter himself over the cratered face of
ganymede the rickety craft would not
let him come down alive

   if he got outside the cone which his
power-beam could reach he would be
helpless fie hadnt far to go-less than
a thousand kilometers from the surface
a couple of hours jaunt in an airboat on
earth-but space was cold and quiet and
very large

  he waited he thought of many
things in a dreamlike part of his mind
remote from that which watched the
radarscope he was aware of being
chilled and cramped hungry and thirsty
dull with fatigue and strain hut it all
seemed far away somehow

   there a pip just sticking over the
noise-level it grew as he stared off to
one side he was going to pass it at an
estimated hundred and fifty kilometers
he switched power back on fought the
wohhling gyros as they brough the boats
nose around he had to aim not where
the ship was now but where it was go-
ing to be when he got there his only in-
	startling stories

struments were the radar the clock his
eyes and the mathematics drilled like
reflexes into his brain

  fire

  the ship was visible a tiny splinter
against heaven another computation
hed pass it by some twenty kilometers
going much too fast-vector in this di-
rection-fire and hope his estimate
hadnt become obsolete in the time need-
ed to make it

  fire

  turn eighteen degrees

  fire

  he passed within a kilometer rela-
tive velocity something like fifty kph
no use trying to maneuver this cranky
wreck any closer he ganged speeds and
distances thankful that hed done free-
fall work before unbuckled himself and
stepped to one of the holes which gaped
raggedly in the cabin then he jumped

  he didnt quite make it almost he
spun past in a long orbit which would
have frozen him to death before it
smashed him against the satellite but
he was carrying an extra oxy bottle for
that emergency its jet wasnt much as
a reaction gun but he rode it back to the
starshine thinking hysterically about
witches on broomsticks when his
magnetic boot soles clamped to the great
hull he swayed for a long time in a
faint

  recovering he looked around through
blurred eves ganymedes grim pock-
marked face bulked tremendously over
the edge of the ship seeming to dwarf
even jupiter shuddering he groped
cautiously in search of an entrance

  the airlock cycled for him good
ship he patted the metal with a lunatic
giggle they built those long-range fel-
lows to last they had to with years
spent on some of the outer-planet ex-
peditions

  it was utterly cold and dark inside
he floated through manv levels his flash
beam a wan puddle of radiance in the
smothering black to find the engines
still running still running at minimum
output

  good good he turned them up

and air and light and warmth began
slowly filling the empty hulk when it

was safe to take off his space-suit he
looped himself to the nearest stanchion
and slept the clock around in complete
exhaustion

tvhfn at last he awoke he inspected
 his prize the food synthesizers
were still in working order but needed
recharging with chemicals which were
in the storerooms he didnt bother
contenting himself -with opening some
plastis and gorging

  fighting the sleepiness that followed
he searched for lifeboats yes there
were four sweet little craft though
somewhat obsolete there was a com-
plete laboratory for all phases of planet-
ographic work a machine shop an elec-
tric shop a wealth of spare parts dave-
nant felt like wallowing in that splendor
of tubes wires optically perfect reflec-
tors

  no no down boy youve got
work to do

  first a lifeboat to fetch kruse and
some outlaw assistants it was a temp-
tation to get just the engineer for the
two of them could take this ship home
but roberts-john was no fool hed
hold them to their bargain at gun point
if necessary

 so-

  how did you go about conquering x
with an army which the hounds could
annihilate in half an hour

  it would have to be bluff davenant
decided with the help of the lifeboats
the outlaws could move unsuspected al-
most to the gates of x ready to take
over if its garrison could be made to lay
down their arms to do this he would
have to-yes build a damper-field gen-
erator against it the jovians would
have no defense for they didnt realize
its limitations when the lights went out
and the air began to grow cold and stag-
nant they should be ready to talk busi-
ness

  if they didnt capitulate

  davenant shrugged one worry at a
time please   
the snows of ganymede	

xn

t hey must be mad with fear down
in x davenants thought of diem riot-
ing in the dark was gruesome but he
forced it out of his mind he sat now in
a lifeboat hunched beside the radio
from time to time the autopilot fired
jets to bring the craft back as its orbit
took it out of communication range he
had contacted the jovians and they had
sent for halleck as ordered now came
the tough part

   hello up there whore yall thiss
cinc- whatcha want hallecks
voice was vague and distorted for the
jovians had only their capacitors now
to furnish power but davenant could
hear the rawness of terror in it
whatve y done

   this is the order of planetary engi-
neers said davenant you were
warned not to molest our men and in-
stead you murdered them weve come
to settle that account

  i-i- no s a lie  accident-
shut up one of our spaceships has
a damper field beamed on your city as
long as we keep it going your power
plants wont operate and youll die when
your capacitors give out

  that was not true there was no way
to beam a damper field nor did it have
much range in point of fact kruse and
an outlaw gang had moved a boat with
an improvised field generator nearly to
the walls of x but davenant had ac-
quired a fast education in diplomacy

  thats the least of what we can do
so youd better accept our terms without
arguing

  what y-want

  are any of those psychotechs you
captured alive    good fetch me
angel garson fast

  but-

  for your information angel garson
has just been made the temporary cinc-
of ganymede so treat him with respect
ill talk to him as soon as hes available
jump to it

   davenant couldnt help feeling a little

ridiculous he was being so completely
out of character not that he didnt have
other weapons but he hated the thought

of bombing the city

  another voice reached him

  hall that you up there my god
man-

  howd they treat you

  oh im still alive drugs got my
information out of me they didnt have
to use torture and we were being kept
as labor for a proposed penal colony
but how in all the hells-

riavenant said in basic look
garson im speaking for the engi-
neers now somebody has to dictate
terms to yoit wolves and i guess were
elected do you think that given an
allied military force you could maintain
a fresh government in x for a few
months 

  y-y-yes the angels swift poise
was a measure of the man davenant felt
humbled had no relish for playing con-
queror garson went on knowing
whatll happen if they dont obey your
orders im pretty sure the people will
cooperate i can institute a propaganda
campaign if i like your ideas

  all right heres what i want
davenant forced himself to snap it out
cincs and hounds will be disarmed
but no revenge taken on them unless they
break the new law we cant afford to
make them desperate outlaws will en-
ter x and have police and administrative
powers your psychotechs can advise
them but their chief has the final word
im giving him strict orders to maintain
the status quo till we send a real task
force from luna so none of your tricks
-because all the psychodynamic equa-
tions in the universe wont stop a damper
field or a lithium shell

  as soon as possible an engineer
delegation will get to you and reorganize
on a more permanent basis what i
anticipate is a fairly open society-as
nearly as can be with these poor dis-
torted people-working toward eventual
human normalcy the interim govern-
ment will be a mixed commission of en-


startling stories

gineers and jovians a strict constitu-
tion will be written and the order will
stand guard for a long time to let the new
political habits take root

  meanwhile terraforming will go on
the order to be paid for that as well as
for its administrative services once
youve got a livable world i dont think
this type of occupation statute will be
needed any more but thats quite a ways
in the future

  i know your institute group has its
own plans whether good or bad i cant
say but youre only human and not to
be trusted with absolute power some
day when this system is well built up
you might decide to fight a war of con-
quest with earth and not even the engi-
neers can stand by and do nothing while
that possibility exists

  youll be free to educate and propa-
gandize openly like everyone else but
the commission is going to be alert for
any cabals so dont figure on taking
over from within again that sound
agreeable to you

  i-garson laughed shakily-i
suppose it has to 

  there was some time required to get
things established under the threat of
the damper field the sergeants were
cooperative enough though rather be-
wildered davenant was well aware the
psychotechs knew he was bluffing about
an engineer fleet out in space but since
their own lives would not be safe until
the outlaws had marched in to garrison
x garsons men had no choice but to
work with him after that it would be
too late for cincs and hounds and in-
stitute people alike

  considering what a long score they
had to settle the barbarians were re-
markably well-behaved nevertheless a
few incidents made davenant feel ill
but had he had any alternative

  kruse voiced the real fear when the
two wefe again alone driving the light
back toward luna

  do you think the abbey will agree to
all this he asked weve made an
awful lot of commitments for them

  i dont think they can do anything

but follow out my promises at least in a
general way said davenant its not
only a matter of prestige and the ultimate
safety of all mankind but    how else
are they going to get that terraforming
contract

  and weve plunged the order into
politics to its ears said kruse

  how much choice had we

  damn little i reckon still its in-
teresting to speculate whether well be
flayed alive or merely boiled in oilr

  most likely cashiered said dave-
nant

  he felt heartsick at the thought for
him there was no other life

  his moody eyes searched the infinite
heaven looking for earth

epilogue

tthe coordinator of the order of
planetary engineers was old but the
eyes in his seamed face were still bril-
liant and he spoke with a young mans
resonance as he sat behind the great
desk a window in the tower framed his
white hair with stars

  send him in he ordered

  yes sir

  the guard unarmed but husky went
out to come back with the prisoner a
nod from the chief dismissed him there
was a long silence

  so said the coordinator at last
youve been playing politics have
you

  the prisoner bit his lip you have
my report sir he answered

  and youve presumably had instruc-
tion in the rules

  sir there are historical prece-
dents-

  the council and myself are empow-
ered to draw conclusions from them
said the coordinator frostily not a
wet-eared tech besides all the excuses
in your report have you anything to say
for yourself

  bitterness lashed back sir it was a
matter of saving lives also if i hadnt
done what i did we wouldnt have the
contract now the rules also say some-
the snows of ganymede

thing about men in the field exercising
independent judgment dont they a
job is more than a problem in machinery
and natural resources people are in-
volved too and theyre the only reason
the work is being done at all

  somewhat emotional murmured
the coordinator but not without a cer-
tain spirit he ruffled the papers before
him ive been looking at your psych
record promising you can be trusted
with further education

  sir

  rules are crutches son the co-
ordinator itemed back in his chair go
on sit down i wont bite you not
very hard anyway as i was saying
rules are valuable for people whose
power of really efficient independent
thought is limited to the mechanics of
their profession weve got to have reg-
ulations but they dont cover every
possible case and the man who can break
them when necessary and get his assign-
ment finished because of that violation is
a man we need

  you did a hell of a good job out
there officially now youre going to
be sent in disgrace to venus to do some
low-grade manual labor that sentence
is for three years pretty stiff eh but
actually son youre going to school-a
little school weve got hidden away for
future members of the council

 i-i-

  dont try to talk said the coordina-
tor right now it makes you look too
much like a fish son the present sys-
tem has been in effect for a long time
the founders knew that the order had
to preserve the appearance of staying out
of politics of being above all local quar-
rels if it was to accomplish its mission



they also knew that it would not always
be possible to remain aloof as you just
said jobs also involve people so from
time to time weve stepped in as quietly
and with as great a show of reluctance
as possible the rules keep us from get-
ting too deeply committed to local tem-
porary affairs the rule-breakers keep
us operating

  if your own violation had been
botched you would be on your way to a
labor camp-unless you preferred a dis-
honorable discharge as it is    well
after a decent interval youll be skipper-
ing a crew of your own and later youll
be elected to the council maybe youre
going to end up behind this desk well
see

  he grinned all right consider
yourself properlydressed down and put
on a hangdog look youll be on your
way tonight good luck

  they clasped hands the prisoner
wheeled and stepped smartly to the door
it opened for him and he was gone

  coordinator hall davenant sighed an
old mans envious sigh memory ran
back over a waste of years to a night
when he had walked across the snows of
ganymede it had not even been a
dream then that he would sit behind
this desk but if it had occurred to him he
would hardly have been able to wait

  and now he had it his highest ambi-
tion lay in his hands for him to do with
as he would but men were walking
across the snows of pluto while he sat
here

  some day the solar system wouldnt
be big enough for them

   briefly he looked out to the cold chal-
lenge of the stars then he returned to
his work

kill a bottle

dick francis

only with thine eyes

 by winston marks

take my daily double-two ounces
of sour-mash bourbon-at mikes
bar down on washington because you
meet all types there and i mean all
types

take this george character you
could hardly call him a type because i

doubt youll ever find another like him
i sincerely hope

  he is big and broad and curly-blond
and he walks in heavily on his heels
right away little mike drops his bar
rag and comes up with an autographed
hard-ball bat


only with

  in spite of his mixed clientele mike
maintains order at any cost and i can
see that he is willing to risk wiping a
few autographs off his trophy stick on
this blond boys skull if necessary

  blond boy sits down on a stool just
the same leaving one space between him
and me mike gives the bat a little wig-
gle and says george how are you

  george ignores him swinging his
handsome shaggy head from left to right
looking at the half-dozen shank-of-the-
aftemoon customers including me

  too curious for my own health i in-
quire of mike whats the occasion

  mike studies the big boy another sec-
ond or two and lets the bat droop this
is george the bar-buster he says he
is known as a crusader against drink
and sex and gambling and well you
know things that are fun but especially
drinking

  my question has collected not only an
interesting answer but also the attention
of this george person who is half-turned
and staring down at my untouched nog-
gin of sour-mash i cup my hand around
it protectively since it is my total daily
ration and i am not only a temperate
drinker but also i am most belligerent
about my temperance nor am i about to
hold still for any nasty abuse over it

  i feel fairly secure in my determina-
tion what with mikes ball-bat backing
me up plus the fact that i juggle steel
for a living and those lumps on my
shoulders are not from eating rich food

  so i decide to needle him buy you
a drink pal i say he raises his head
for the first time and glares at me with a
pair of eyes that grind into me like two
jets from a sand-blaster i mean they
are really fanatical they are wide open
with an acre of dead white surrounding
each black iris which is barely rimmed
with blue it is dark in mikes but those
irises are dilated like a hop-heads

  i	get a charge out of reading this pop-
ular psychology stuff it gives me sort of
a morbid appetite for details about what
makes peculiar people tick george is
one peculiar apple and before i think
twice i blurt out what gets into people

thine eyes	

like you mister  why do you think you
got a license to go staring bug-eyed at
decent people having a snort or two

  now mind you when i ask this nosy
question i have not yet tasted my drink
nor during the following recitation do i
so much as glance down at it

  my question hits this george in the
face like something wet and cold he
screws up his forehead for a long min-
ute and when it unravels he has a
thoughtful look slowly he shifts over
to the stool next to me drops his eyes
to my drink and starts talking like he
was reading it all off the surface of my
straight shot

  he says in a low husky voice sure
ill tell you i hate alcohol and i enjoy
hating alcohol like you enjoy drinking
it

  tell me about it i say and he
does

have hated alcohol since commence-
ment day five years ago my mother
is dead drank herself to death but my
dad was there to see me get my ba
degree he was there and he was drunk

  he fell asleep during the program and
when they called my name it woke him
up he got confused and thought he
was attending some sort of alumnus af-
fair he saw me up on the stage and
stood up and shouted good old george
three cheers for my son good old
george

  it got so quiet in the auditorium you
could hear my diploma hit the floor of
the stage when poor old dr mathews
dropped it somebody in the audience
snickered and when dr mathews and i
knocked heads bending over to get it
a few others began laughing

  this gave dad all the encouragement
he needed he yelled when you guys
get through ducking for apples up there
lets get this partv rolling

  give a lot of bored people a good
shocking embarrassment and theyll
usually laugh it off thats what hap-
pened the whole auditorium broke into
hysterics-even the board of regents and
the faculty they could afford to dad
had endowed the school with more than
eu	startling stories

a million dollars during my attendance
there

  this was nothing new or funny to me
it was just the final mortification after
a hundred incidents leading up to this
moment and the memory of dads love
and all the indulgence that seventeen oil
wells could buy for me vanished in this
supreme humiliation

  dad wasnt particularly repentant
when he realized what had happened he
dragged me off to the biggest hotel in
town where he had made arrangements
for a whing-ding part for the whole
graduating class

  it was a fiasco the college officials
and instructors came because they had
to but only one member of my class
showed up that was helen

  i loved her i worshipped and adored
her she was the only reason i had
stayed in college four years there was
only one thing wrong with her she was
weak weak the same way mother and
dad were weak she was weak and for-
giving even to the extent of overlooking
dads outrageous behavior at our grad-
uation exercise

  when she came into the grand ball-
room where dad was holding forth with
the champagne t grabbed her hand and
towed her upstairs to dads suite

  she looked at me up there and said
im ashamed of you

  for running out on the old sot i
said

  hes your father she said he
meant no harm and he thinks the world
of you now lets go down and let him
drink to you

  helen was beautiful and stubborn and
loyal to dad in a way ill never under-
stand i looked at her black hair waving
down over her white graduation dress
covering her shoulders and setting off
her soft little features like an ebony
frame and i almost gave in then the
laughter came back to my ears and i
stood firm

  dad is a drunk i told her flatly
hes rich and generous and the salt of
the earth but hes not only a drunk he
spends a fortune turning other innocent

people into drunks every year i want
nothing more to do with him

  i had my special reasons for not want-
ing helen around dad any more i said
i want this very plain to you if we
are to be married you must realize that
we will not associate with dad in the fu-
ture i have my own income from the
wells mother left me its not like dads
fortune but well get along

  then i got told off

  look buster she said for almost
four years ive waited for you to thaw
out i mustnt smoke i mustnt take a
cocktail we mustnt neck-save that
for later so for four years ive lived
like in a convent and the only fun ive
had was when your dad was around
helen i broke in i love you i
want you to marry me right now to-
day but we must have an understand-
ing

  take your eyes off of me she
shrieked no more of that maybe you
can get your satisfaction out of life by
staring at people and things but its not
enough for me

  then she did something i had strictly
forbidden her to do she threw her arms
around me and pressed her lips to mine
she had been drinking i could smell it
on her breath now

  i peeled her off and when i did she
dropped into a chair and stared at me
that tears it she said ill marry no
stuffed shirt and you can wipe that
horrified look off your face too sure i
had a couple high-balls over at the house
and if you think i could go through life
with a man who-

  she trailed off because i had my eyes
on hers drinking deeply of her loveli-
ness her face became pale and her
body rigid and strained she whispered
stop it i wont allow it again let
me go i tell you

  i wasnt holding her she was perfect-
ly free to move but she didnt t was
oblivious to all but my thirst for her and
i drank my fill while she writhed in the
chair trying to break our visual contact

  when i finished i staggered to a chair
she was exhausted too this was a little
only with thine eyes	

different from the many times before
along with the peace i had a slight feel-
ing of exhilaration

  i said now lets talk sensibly you
know how i feel about liquor if we live
with dad it will always be around us
with people urging us to drink

  she wasnt listening to me she said
george that thing that-that you do
to me with your eyes-its-not right

  you used to like it i reminded her

  it makes-my soul feel naked she
complained and now i dont feel like
i had any drinks at all

  at any other time i would have been
amused this was the same girl who was
daring me to seduce her only minutes
ago i hadnt even touched her yet here
she was accusing me of something or
other

  you hypnotize me into-into feeling
like i want to feel she said then she
cried and whats more you stole my
drinks she got up and slammed out
of the room

  i sighed over her irrational behaviour
for years now i had been protecting her
against her own weaknesses her fond-
ness for alcoholic drinks and especially
her impulsive sexuality and what
thanks did i get a door slammed in
my face

  granted it was harder for her to hold
back her emotions than it was for me
somehow i had been able to sublimate
my terrible desire for her by staring into
her brown eyes and drawing freely on
the love and compassion i found there
it was apparently satisfying to her until
today for she had been my undisputed
property on the campus from the first
date at the freshman ball

  i had no idea how serious my problem
was until i went down to the ball-room
to search for helen she was there all
right off in a corner crying on dads
shoulder while he filled up her cham-
pagne glass with one hand and patted
her on the back with the other

  dad was only  then astall and
strong as i and a hell of a lot better com-
pany for a young girl i guess he had
jokingly threatened to adopt helen if i

failed to marry her but the way he had
his arm around her waist right now was
far from paternal

  i went upstairs and got my bag in an
hour i was on a plane for new york
and the next day i cashed in helens
steamship ticket for bermuda and used
the other one i went on a honeymoon
all by myself

on the ship and at the resort i de-
liberately tried to cut helen out of
my mind by falling in love with a half
dozen different girls all at once there
was plenty of raw material once word
got around about my oil wells but i
couldnt seem to make the grade i have
always abhorred casual intimacies and
these young females proved much too
aggressive in that department i had a
miserable month and when i returned
and checked in at my office the first news
i had confirmed my prediction

  dad had married helen

  there was a message they were
honeymooning on long island sound
and wouldnt i come and visit them

  i failed to notice the old date on the
telegram feeling they were safely out
of the way i flew to the old homestead
out of houston figuring on cleaning out
my personal effects before helen took
over the family home as mistress and
my stepmother

  the big old -room pile of rock
seemed like anything but home as i
pulled up to it in a cab it was dinner-
time and i noticed the lights on in the
dining room from the grin old tom
gave me i thought the servants must be
having a party while my father was
away so i rambled in to give them a
cheap thrill

  i was completely into the room before
 realized that dad was at the head of
the table helen at the foot and a sprin-
kling of important-appearing gentlemen
in shoe-string ties in between it was
too late to back out especially after dad
introduced the strangers as a passel of
southern senators who were helping out
on the tidelands oil bill

  dad welcomed me home as casually as
if i had just been downtown shopping
	startling stories

for a new tie

  helen was lovely extravagantly
dressed and tipsy they had all been
drinking and no one would hear my ex-
cuses having a sharp interest in the
tidelands legislation myself i couldnt
offend the senators i let them put on a
plate for me

  when i refused the wine everyone
kidded me dad said dont urge it on
him he cant handle it when he was
sixteen i let him have a shot of tequila
and we found him in the pantry ten min-
utes later with the upstairs maid

  they all had a great laugh at my ex-
pense even helen tinkled at me the
story of course was a lie in fact and
implication i had not drunk any tequila
and whats more i hadnt touched the
upstairs maid she was the little mexi-
can girl who had taught me about my
eyes and how to-to do whatever it is i
do with them we were caught in the
pantry but i was only looking into her
eyes

  the dinner wore on into a typical fes-
tivity and when i kept my eyes away
from the foot of the table it was easy to
foster the illusion that things were back
as they were in my boyhood before
mothers liver dissolved

  dad was the pink-faced genial host
drawling his inexhaustible series of long-
winded if genuinely funny jokes it be-
came difficult for me to keep from staring
at helen the more she drank the bolder
she became with her eyes each time i
glanced at her her lids would lift wide
as if inviting me to come in

  there was a new look of maturity in
her eyes but the caution that had sprung
to them when i first entered the room
gradually dissolved under the influence
of the cocktails red wine white wine
pink wine and brandy and now her old
affectionate look was warm and open-
so much so that t feared dad would
see it

  he did hut responded differently from
what t had expected he stood up and
herded the senators into the billiard
room ignoring helen and me until he
got to the door then he turned and
said gently i expect you would like to

get acquainted with your new ma see
you later on the terrace behave now
helen took him at his word and
headed for the terrace i seated myself
across from her my back to the sunset
and tried my best not to look her in the
eyes

  she was drunk but she could still talk
plainly she said you hurt your dad
by running out on him like that

  t said it looks like youve pretty
well healed him up

  she crossed her knees and let a few
more curves develop in her posture but
i still wouldnt look her in the face i
knew she was much too decent to put on
such a voluptuous act if she hadnt been
drinking

  you were surprised to hear about-
our marriage

  not at all i told her thats an-
other reason the main reason i wanted
to get you away i knew you were at-
tracted to dad and i knew he loved
you and it was no father-daughter
business either

  she sighed at least you arent ac-
cusing me of marrying him because he
has more money

  that had never crossed my mind
helen had worked her way through col-
lege refusing every cent of help that
both dad and i had tried to force upon
her dishonesty was not one of her
weaknesses

  are you happy now i asked
almost-completely she said at
once i only miss one thing george
and i didnt realize that until you came
in tonight

  i had to look at her now what is
it i asked foolishly

  your eyes she said and she had
me trapped the sunset reflected in her
face and her eyes were like the poets
say two bottomless pools where once
i had tasted and sipped now i fell in
bodilv and wallowed partly out of self-
pity but mostly in sheer sensuality

  the little mexican girl had taught me
the trick but she had been voung helen
was a woman now and her eyes were
moist and warm and demanding and for
the first time i felt the reciprocation of
only with

the licentious liberties i had taken with
her in our college days

  although we were yards apart i con-
sumed her like a flame flashing through
a piece of gauze it was quick and vio-
lent and wicked i knew now what she
had meant in the hotel room

  but suddenly i was filled with a great
stupor my head sank back and i barely
could understand helens husky words
she chuckled it worked again this
is better than benzedrine or black cof-
fee it made no sense to me

thine eyes	

helen but you couldnt expect me to
go off and desert her like you did

  he stood at the foot of the bed some-
what embarrassed yet defiant in a way
i know i could have adopted her he
said but that wouldnt have been very
honest i loved her the way you loved
her and i couldnt stand to see her hurt
like that

  besides he added i guess we were
a little tight at the time

  there it was liquor again probably
the marriage would never have occurred

i scarcely remember being put to
bed in the morning i had a splitting
headache and felt entirely miserable i
suppose it was my conscience plus the
tremendous wear of the emotional expe-
rience

  my remorse was so great that when
dad came in at ten am and put an ice-
pack on my head i almost cried if i
could have found a way to make him
understand i would have confessed
everything to him but it was no use

  he was quite sober and in good spirits
dont act so ashamed son he told me
so you tied one on so i expected you
to i know you still think the world of

if both of them hadnt been drinking
helen and i would have gotten over our
differences and been reunited but now
it was ruined all wrong and i was in
the midst of something i couldnt escape

  thats right in spite of my attack of
conscience my resolve to stay away from
helen was gone this part dad didnt
understand he said i suppose you
just came back for your things

  t looked at him and said not at all
i have no intention of leaving this
home is half mine

  that rocked him a little hell son
this is no business you and-helen-
and i-


startling stories

  dont worry i said i wont touch
her shes yours body and- i couldnt
bring myself to say soul just dont
expect me to call her mother i added
bitterly

  dad stalked out of the room but when
 came down for late breakfast he and
helen were in the best of spirits it was
lunch for them and beside dads plate
was a tumbler half full of bourbon

  we ate on the terrace and the sun
shown down on that whisky making
it gleam at me like a baleful amber eye
it had grown to mean more than a sym-
bol for my embarrassments as i stared
at it the golden glint was the distillation
of pure evil the root of my frustrations
dads emotional unpredictability and
helens-what infidelity 

  the sparkle of the wicked fluid hurt
my eyes and my brain throbbed with
mounting pain as i glared at it then i
became aware of a remarkable thing
the level of the liquor was dropping in
the crystal goblet as i stared my hatred
at the vile stuff it diminished lower and
lower and when dad finally tipped it up
he was surprised to find less than a
spoonful left

  i have given much thought to this
phenomenon the nearest thing to a rea-
sonable explanation i can arrive at is
some form of psycho-kinesis combined
with the destructive power of pure
hatred where the liquor went i dont
know i suppose it evaporated under the
intense power of my loathing

  dad simply muttered under his breath
and reached for the decanter again but
this time he tossed it off before i could
repeat my performance my head buzzed
pleasantly - with my newly discovered
power over my enemy alcohol

  helen it turned out never drank be-
fore evening she was fresh and beauti-
ful in a simple little cotton frock and
it made my heart ache the way she avoid-
ed mv eves she poured mv coffee and
chattered pleasantly but never would
she look above the top button of my shirt

  there were guests again that evening
as there were almost every evening men
guests politicians ranchers and oilmen
and when they went to the billiard room

helen and i went to the terrace again
she had drunk considerably less this
evening keeping her gaze averted all
during the dinner but when we were
across from each other alone she looked
up immediately and it was as if she
slipped into my arms this time we were
less frantic about it and the peculiar
stupor slid into my head gently along
with the ineffable happiness that poured
from helens eyes

  afterwards i made my way to my
room without help and sank into a deep
restful sleep

  and this became our daily routine i
was careful to preserve helens imper-
sonal attitude toward me and avoided be-
ing left alone with her except in the
evening when we went to the open ter-
race together to the servants or an in-
advertent guest our actions were most
circumspect

  each morning i would awaken feeling
poorly but as soon as i dressed and went
down to breakfast i would find one of the
liquor decanters that dad kept all over
the house and assert my power over the
filthy stuff by lowering the level with my
powerful stare and immediately the ex-
ercise of my emotion would pick me up
with a pleasant sense of well-being not
of course that i was denying anyone a
drink of the stuff but i guess the very
destruction of a few ounces of it disposed
of my accumuated hatred

  at times when i annihilated a larger
amount than usual a veritable feeling of
euphoria would overtake me and gradu-
ally i sought this pleasant feeling

  not only did it dispel my morning
affliction but it helped dismiss my feel-
ing of remorse and guilt about helen
it helped me reason this thing out too
after all i was keeping my word to
dad i never touched his wife nor gave
anyone cause for a breath of scandal

life was quite hearable for several
months my houston office took
onlv cursory supervision and my new
york office ran itself oil wells produce
their wealth with monotonous ease once
they are discovered and in operation and
i was in no mood to speculate on new
only with

wells at the present

  then dad had to take a business trip
to the east he took helen along and
they were gone a week i missed her
dreadfully but it was nothing compared
to the frenzy our separation threw her
into dad almost caught on when she
kept wanting to return but she convinced
him it was just an attack of nerves
that first night of our reunion on the
terrace she whispered to me that i must
never let such a separation happen again
her eyes flashed into mine greedily al-
though she had had not a drop to drink

  our communion was brief but of maxi-
mum violence when it was over helen
was white as a ghost so pale it frightened
me i called dad from the billiard room
he picked her up clucking about her
nerves but as he turned she gave me a
little grateful smile

  i too was exhausted-and worried
dad had mentioned a tour of the riviera
in the near future and he had hinted
strongly that i would be expected to
stay behind and keep an eye on things

  a week later when he broached the
subject to helen and me at breakfast i
thought helen would break down she
made one excuse after another delaying
their departure date a whole month fi-
nally dad became suspicious

  on one of the rare nights when there
were no guests he watched helen and
me wander out to the terrace and fol-
lowed after he seated himself on the
wicker seat beside helen and said
well leave for the continent a week
from today

  he watched both of us for our reac-
tion helen didnt disguise hers too well
dad turned to her youre still very
much in love with george arent you
helen had had enough to drink to be
boldly honest she nodded of course
i am but t love you too just as much
as ever

  dad looked at me and he didnt have
to ask me he said thats what i fig-
ured will vou go to europe with me
helen or do you want a divorce

  no no she cried not a divorce
i do love you she clung to his arm
like a little girl and i could find not the

thine eyes	

slightest pang of jealousy in me she
loved dad and i loved dad and he
loved us and we loved each other it was
all so mixed up and yet so simple-if it
werent for the liquor

  dad had been drinking heavily he
blinked at both of us and said then
well sail on the queen elizabeth
thats not the way helen wailed
i dont want to go i hate europe
its the only way dad said stub-
bornly either youre married to me or
youre not well find out

  i could say nothing the following
week was nightmarish but i didnt feel
the full impact of my loss until they were
gone

  that first night alone in the big house
i destroyed the contents of two full de-
canters of brandy but the old feeling of
power and contentment never appeared
in the middle of the night i awoke with
a terrible presentiment

  i got up dressed drove to the airport
and caught the first plane to new york
i missed their sailing by two hours i
tried to hire a helicopter but by the time
i got customs clearance the queen eliza-
beth was beyond range

  briefly i considered taking a trans-
atlantic plane and meeting them in lon-
don but i knew that would be too late
helen was despondent when they left
for the whole of last week dad had kept
us from the terrace a few more days
apart and-

  i read about it in the headlines lost
overboard beautiful young wife of oil
magnate disappears in night plunge

  dwelling on how it must have hap-
pened nearly drove me mad she would
have been drinking loving me and
wanting me and loving dad enogh to
refuse to hurt him by deserting him-
she had decided on the quick solu-
tion-the quick clean cut of suicide in-
stead of the mauling bludgeon of the di-
vorce court the scandal and the lingering
pain it would leave in dads heart

  liquor she would never have done
such a thing sober

  thats when i hit the bars i bought
a hockev-stick in a sporting-goods store
and headed for the nearest bars i


startling stories

worked my way through three of them
before the police caught up to me

  i could afford it and when they
turned me loose i got three more and
three more then they started tossing
me in the jug so i returned to houston
and smashed up what i could lay my
hands on before they jailed me

  sure it was foolish theres always
more liquor to replace what i destroy
and its foolish for me to go on this
way too but at least im staying out
of jail now

which brings this george charac-
ters tale to an end

  i reach for my double shot but the
glass is empty like i said before i
havent touched it i know because it is
my first and only drink of the day and
the first one is never hard to keep track
of-thats whv i never try a second

  then i notice that the other people at
the bar are staring at their empty glasses
too

  mike puts down the bat and gathers
up our glasses as he refills them he
mutters to himself now ive seen
everything and heard everything

  he puts them before us and returns to
stand in front of george who is staring
at his flushed face in the back-bar mirror
mike says i dont know nothing about
psycho-kineeziz and ill admit its as

fair a bar trick as ive seen pulled all
i know is that youve disposed of every
drink on the bar-three highballs two
singles and a double shot of sour-mash
and that comes to  he has the
ball-bat handy again

  we all look at george the whites of
his eyes now look more like skinned red
plums and his head is weaving just a lit-
tle i know what you think he said
lowly you think im crazy dont

vou

  mikes shakes his head nope i
think youve just had too much-to see
-six drinks in ten minutes

  george raises his husky voice you
mean to imply- he roars

  mike grips the hat and moves to the
telephone and begins dialing in little
quick jerks

  wait george says hurriedly
dont call the police they always
throw me in the drunk tank i cant
stand that stop it ill pay here he
tosses a crumpled twenty-dollar bill on
the bar spills off the stool onto unsteady
legs and makes for the door mike yells
at him to pick up his change but george
ignores him

  i watch him lurch out into the dusk
then i look back at my drink t stare at
it hard as i can but nothing happens
i guess i cant bring enough hate to bear
on it

worked on unperturbed his work his

getting ahead there was no doubt of
that his lean body was bent like a
coiled spring over the tape scanner cold
gray eyes taking in the information
feverishly analyzing appraising his
conceptual faculties operating like well-
greased machinery

  jills lips trembled in misery and re-
sentment gus-little gus how could

tered he dropped his little gray kitten

tion whats wrong with the psych

  i lester frowned rubbing his
lip hmm interesting he brightened
well thats all in the past whats for
dinner im faint with hunger

  jill eyed him uncertainly as she
moved into the kitchen anything you
want lester you know our stove cov-
ers the maximum select-list

  of course lester coughed rapidly
well shall we try sirloin steak
medium smothered in onions with
mushroom sauce and white rolls with
hot coffee perhaps ice cream and apple
pie for dessert

  you never seemed to care much
about food jill said thoughtfully
oh

  you always said you hoped eventu-
ally theyd make intravenous intake uni-
versally applicable she studied her
husband intently lester whats
happened 

  nothing nothing at all lester
carelessly took his pipe out and lit it
rapidly somewhat awkwardly bits of
tobacco drifted to the rug he bent
nervously down and tried to pick them
up again please go about your tasks
and dont mind me perhaps i can help
you prepare-that is can i do any-
thing to help

  no jill said i can do it you

go ahead with your work if you want
  work

  your research in toxins

  toxins i lester showed confusion
well for heavens sake toxins devil
take it

  what dear

  i mean i really feel too tired just
now ill work later lester moved
vaguely around the room i think ill
just sit and enjoy being home again
off that awful rexor iv

  was it awful

  horrible a spasm of disgust
crossed lesters face dry and dead
ancient squeezed to a pulp by wind
and sun a dreadful place my dear
im sorry to hear that i always
wanted to visit it

  heaven forbid lester cried feel-
ingly you stay right here my dear
with me the-the two of us his
eyes wandered about the room two
yes terra is a wonderful planet moist
and full of life he beamed happily
just right

t dont understand it jill
     said

  repeat all the things you remember
frank said his robot pencil poised it-
self alertly the changes youve
noticed in him im curious

  why

  no reason go on you say you
sensed it right away that he was dif-
ferent 

  i noticed it at once the expression
on his face not that hard practical
look a sort of mellow look relaxed
tolerant a sort of calmness

  i see frank said what else

  jill peered nervously through the back
door into the house he cant hear us
can he

  no hes inside playing with gus
in the living room theyre venusian
otter-men today your husband built
an otter slide down at his lab i saw
him unwrapping it

  his talk

  his what

  the way he talks his choice of
human is	

words words he never used before
whole new phrases metaphors i
never heard him use a metaphor in all
our five years together he said meta-
phors were inexact misleading and

a

  and what the pencil scratched
busily

  and theyre strange words old
words words you dont hear any
more

  archaic phraseology frank asked
tensely

  yes jill paced back and forth
across th small lawn her hands in the
pockets of her plastic shorts formal
words like something-

  something out of a book
  exactly youve noticed it

  i noticed it franks face was grim
go on

  jill stopped pacing whats on your
mind do you have a theory

  i want to know more facts

  she reflected he plays with gus
he plays and jokes and he-he eats
didnt he eat before

  not like he does now now he loves
food he goes in the kitchen and tries
endless combinations he and the stove
get together and cook up all sorts of
weird things

  i thought hed put on weight

  hes gained ten pounds he eats
smiles and laughs hes constantly
polite jill glanced away coyly hes
even-romantic he always said that
was irrational and hes not interested
in his work his research in toxins
i see frank chewed his lip any-
thing more

  one thing puzzles me very much
ive noticed it again and again
what is it

  he seems to have strange lapses
of-

  a burst of laughter lester herrick
eyes bright with merriment came rush-
ing out of the house little gus close
behind

  we have an announcement les-
ter cried

  an anounzelmen gus echoed

  frank folded his notes up and slid
them into his coat pocket the pencil
hurried after them he got slowly to
his feet what is it

  you make it lester said taking
little gus hand and leading him for-
ward

  gus plump face screwed up in con-
centration im going to come live
with you he stated anxiously he
watched jills expression lester says
i can can i can i aunt jill

  her heart flooded with incredible joy
she glanced from gus to lester do
you-do you really mean it her
voice was almost inaudible

  lester put his arm around her hold-
ing her close to him of course we
mean it he said gently his eyes were
warm and understanding we wouldnt
tease you my dear

  no teasing gus shouted excitedly
no more teasing he and lester and
jill drew close together never again
frank stood a little way off his face
grim jill noticed him and broke away
abruptly what is it she faltered
is anything-

  when youre quite finished frank
said to lester herrick id like you to
come with me

  a chill clutched jills heart what is
it cant i come too

  frank shook his head he moved
toward lester ominously come on
herrick lets go you and i are going
to take a little trip

the three federal clearance agents
took up positions a few feet from
lester herrick vibro-tubes gripped
alertly

  clearance director douglas studied
herrick for a long time youre sure
he said finally

  absolutely frank stated

  when did he get back from rexor
iv

  a week ago

  and the change was noticeable at
once 

  his wife noticed it as soon as she
saw him theres no doubt it occurred
	startling stories

 on rexor frank paused significantly
 and you know what that means

   i know douglas walked slowly
 around the seated man examining him
 from every angle

    lester herrick sat quietly his coat
 neatly folded across his knee he rested
  his hands on his ivory-topped cane his
 face calm and expressionless he wore
 a soft gray suit a subdued necktie
 french cuffs and shiny black shoes he
 said nothing

   their methods are simple and
 exact douglas said  the original
 psychic contents are removed and stored
 -in some sort of suspension the in-
 jection of the substitute contents is
 instantaneous lester herrick was
 probably poking around the rexor city
 ruins ignoring the safety precautions-
 shield or manual screen-and they got
 him

   the seated man stirred id like
 very much to communicate with jill he
 murmured she surely is becoming
 anxious

    frank turned away face choked with
 revulsion god its still pretending

    director douglas restrained himself
 with the greatest effort its certainly
 an amazing thing no physical changes
 you could look at it and never know
 he moved toward the seated man his
 face hard listen to me whatever you
 call yourself can you understand what
 i say

   of course lester herrick an-
 swered

    did you really think youd get away
 with it we caught the others-the
 ones before you all ten of them even
 before they got here douglas grinned
 coldly vibro-rayed them one after
 another

    the color left lester herricks face
  sweat came out on his forehead he
  wiped it away with a silk handkerchief
  from his breast pocket oh  he mur-
  mured

    youre not fooling us all terra is
 alerted for you rexorians im surprised
 you got off rexor at all herrick must
 have been extremely careless we

stopped the others aboard ship fried
them out in deep space

  herrick had a private ship the
seated man murmured he by-passed
the check station going in no record of
his arrival existed he was never
checked

  fry it douglas grated the three
clearance agents lifted their tubes
moving forward

  no frank shook his head we
cant its a had situation

  what do you mean why cant we
we fried the others-

  they were caught in dep space
this is terra terran law not military
law applies frank waved toward the
seated man and its in a human body
it comes under regular civil laws weve
got to prove its not lester ilerrick-
that its a rexorian infiltrater its go-
ing to be tough but it can be done
how 

  his wife herricks wife her testi-
mony jill herrick can assert the dif-
ference between -lester herrick and
this thing she knows-and i think we
can make it stand up in court

                                                

t was late afternoon frank drove
his surface cruiser slowly along
neither he nor jill spoke

  so thats it jill said at last her
face was gray her eyes dry and bright
without emotion i knew it was too
good to be true she tried to smile
it seemed so wonderful

  i know frank said its a terrible
damn thing if only-

  why jill said why did he-did
it do this why did it take lesters
body 

  rexor iv is old dead a dying
planet life is dying out

  i remember now he-it said some-
thing like that something about rexor
that it was glad to get away

  the rexorians are an old race the
few that remain are feeble theyve
been trying to migrate for centuries
but their bodies are too weak some
tried to migrate to venus-and died
instantly they worked out this system
about a century ago

  but it knows so much about us
it speaks our language

  not quite the changes you men-
tioned the odd diction you see the
kexorians have only a vague knowledge
of human beings a sort of ideal ab-
straction taken from terran objects
that have found their way to rexor
books mostly secondary data like
that the rexorian idea of terra is
based on centuries-old terran literature
romantic novels from our past lan-
guage custom manners from old terran
books

  that accounts for the strange archaic
quality to it it had studied terra all
right but in an indirect and misleading
way frank grinned wryly the
rexorians are two hundred years behind
the times-which is a break for us
thats how were able to detect them
is this sort of thing-common does
it happen often it seems unbelievable
jill rubbed her forehead wearily
dreamlike its hard to realize that
its actually happened im just begin-
ning to understand what it means
the galaxy is full of alien life-forms
parasitic and destructive entities terran
ethics dont extend to them we have
to guard constantly against this sort of
thing lester went in unsuspectingly-
and this thing ousted him and took over
his body

   frank glanced at his sister jills face
was expressionless a stern little face
wide-eyed but composed she sat up
straight staring fixedly ahead her small
hands folded quietly in her lap

  we can arrange it so you wont have
to actually appear in court frank went
on you can vid a statement and itll
be presented as evidence im certain
your statement will do it the federal
courts will help us all they can but they
have to have some evidence to go on
jill was silent

  what do you say frank asked
what happens after the court makes
its decision

  then we vibro-ray it destroy the
rexorian mind a terran patrol ship

iy

on rexor iv sends out a party to locate
the-er-original contents

  jill gasped she turned toward her
brother in amazement you mean-
oh yes lester is alive in sus-
pension somewhere on rexor in one
of the old city ruins well have to
force them to give him up they wont
want to but theyll do it theyve done
it before then hell be back with you
safe and sound just like before and
this horrible nightmare youve been
living will be a thing of the past

   i see

  here we are the cruiser pulled to
halt before the imposing federal clear-
ance building frank got quickly out
holding the door for his sister jill
stepped down slowly okay frank
said

  okay

when they entered the building
clearance agents led them through
the check screens down the long corri-
dors jills high heels echoed in the
ominous silence

  quite a place frank observed
  its unfriendly

   consider it a glorified police station
frank halted before them was a
guarded door here we are

  wait jill pulled back her face
twisting in panic i-

  well wait until youre ready
frank signaled to the clearance agents
to leave i understand its a bad
business

  jill stood for a moment her head
down she took a deep breath her
small fists clenched her chin came up
level and steady all right

  you ready

  yes

  frank opened the door here we
are

  director douglas and the three clear-
ance agents turned expectantly as jill
and frank entered good douglas
murmured with relief i was begin-
ning to get worried

the siting man got slowly to his feet
picking up his coat he gripped hl


startling stories

ivory-headed cane tightly his hands
tense he said nothing he watched
silently as the woman entered the room
frank behind her this is mrs her-
rick frank said jill this is clearance
director douglas

  ive heard of you jill said faintly
  then you know our work

  yes i know your work

  this is an unfortunate business its
happened before i dont know what
frank has told you-

  he explained the situation
good douglas was relieved im
glad of that its not easy to explain
you understand then what we want
the previous cases were caught in deep
space we vibro-tubed them and got the
original contents back but this time
we must work through legal channels
douglas picked up a vid-tape recorder
we will need your statement mrs
herrick since no physical change has
occurred well have no direct evidence
to make our case well have only your
testimony of character alteration to
present to the court

  he held the vid-tape recorder out
jill took it slowly

  your statement will undoubtedly be
accepted by the court the court will
give us the release we want and then we
can go ahead if everything goes cor-
rectly we hope to be able to set up
things exactly as they were before

  jill was gazing silently at the man
standing in the corner with his coat and
ivory-headed cane before she said
what do you mean

  before the change

  jill turned toward director douglas
calmly she laid the vid-tape recorder
down on the table what change are
you talking about

  douglas paled he licked his lips all
eyes in the room were on jill the
change in him he pointed at the man

  jill  frank barked whats the
matter with you he came quickly
toward her what the hell are you do-
ing you know damn well what change
we mean

  thats odd jill said thoughtfully

i havent noticed any change

  frank and director douglas looked at
each other i dont get it frank mut-
tered dazed

mrs herrick- douglas began

  jill walked over to the man standing
quietly in the corner can we go now
dear she asked she took his arm
or is there some reason why my hus-
band has to stay here

the man and woman walked silently
along the dark street

 come on jill said lets go
home

  the man glanced at her its a nice
afternoon he said he took a deep
breath filling his lungs spring is com-
ing-i think isnt it

  jill nodded

i wasnt sure its a nice smell
plants and soil and growing things

  yes

are we going to walk is it far

  not too far

  the man gazed at her intently a
serious expression on his face i am
very indebted to you my dear he said

  jill nodded

  i wish to thank you i must admit i
did not expect such a-

  jill turned abruptly what is your
name your real name

  the mans gray eyes flickered he
smiled a little a kind gentle smile im
afraid you would not be able to
pronounce it the sounds cannot be
formed   

  jill was silent as they walked along
deep in thought the city lights were
coming on all around them bright
yellow spots in the gloom what are
you thinking the man asked

  i was thinking perhaps i will still
call you lester jill said if you dont
mind

  i dont mind the man said he put
his arm around her drawing her close
to him he gazed down tenderly as they
walked through the thickening dark-
ness between the yellow candles of light
that marked the way anything you
wish whatever will make you happy

by robert zacks

joes face was bleak as he stared
out the window at the golden sun-
shine spilling off the pastel green streets
outside hed been in ci miserable mood
lately unable to shake it off despite ev-
ery psychological trick he used to get
free of it deep deep inside something
was eating at him he wouldnt face it

  irritably he squirmed he pressed the
wall button and the whole side of the
cottage smoothly slid up folding out of
sight the spring breeze flooded in
mussing his hair and playfully slapping
his face it didnt make him feel any bet-
ter

  from the doorway ann said whats

why read the future - when you dont know your past


	aiaiixlmu siwnim

the matter dear

  joe was startled huh nothing
nothing

  she stood there a placid woman
pleasant but not pretty her robe of
shining green cloth clutched about her
pudgy figure a distressed look was on
her face a touch of fear she came in
and sat down next to joe

  lately youve been unhappy she
said

  i-ah-guess its the job he mut-
tered im always this way before
facing that damn job

  three hours a day ann said quiet-
ly it was a simple reproof a tearing
away of the mask hiding his shrinking
misery

  well he growled i dont know
what it is then

  he didnt look at her he was sud-
denly angry at the vast guilt feelings that
surged in him

  ill fix you a good breakfast she
said hopefully got a new spice from
venus

  not hungry he snarled and stopped
in shame and shock at himself as she
recoiled sorry he mumbled

  for a bad moment they didnt look at
each other then she got up wearily pre-
pared breakfast-ordinary toast eggs
and coffee-just like a hidebound tradi-
tionalist fighting even with his foods to
retain a semblance of the old ways of
thinking

  they ate in silence then ann dressed
she kissed him with a touch of despera-
tion as he left for the automatic factory
where he was a maintenance man who
did nothing but read meters and watch
for lights flashing indicating the needs
for a new part in the vast machine

  joe thought unhappily whats the
matter with me  why am i such a louse
to her these days

  but of course he knew even though
as a mature person hed erected tre-
mendous defenses against letting the in-
fantile thought grow

he might have killed the torment-
ing idea that he was fed up with

her that he deserved something better
than ann somebody prettier more ex-
citing more of a challenge if it werent
that he now had to pass a certain corner
and the tantalizing sign which blazed in
luminous letters to smirking passersby
have your past read

only three credits

  joe stopped and frowned in angry dis-
approval maybe he wasnt a registered
traditionalist but one thing they stood
for with which he agreed-the elimina-
tion of this kind of disgraceful gypsying

  why dont they stop these guys he
muttered wrathfully

  belligerently he stared into the win-
dow an unshaven man in a dirty shirt
squatted on a cushion on the floor his
lips pursed in a soundless whistle as he
cautiously cut his toenails with scissors
a sleazy woman in a multicolored dress
and ancient long earrings lovingly ex-
amined a tarnished golden necklace of
coins

  she looked up caught joes eye
pointed to the sign and beckoned

  furiously joe went inside even though
he knew his friends would look at him
with raised eyebrows if they saw him

  listen he growled why dont you
gypsies take your three hours duty like
the rest of us  you all ought to be locked
up thats what i say

  were hurting nobody said the
man smiling pausing with his toenail
cutting nobody supports us but our-
selves 

  read your past mister asked the
woman mockingly she laughed shrilly
thats what you really came in for isnt
it

  i know my past shouted joe turn-
ing his eyes with a sort of fascinated
dread on the machine set against the wall

  it was a huge crystal ball supported
by a square metal box which contained
he knew complex circuits and equip-
ment that the traditionalists were fight-
ing like mad to have destroyed so far
theyd managed to keep a large number
of the population away by means of in-
tensive propaganda and social organ-
ization
have your past read mister	

  you know your past said the
woman she laughed which one
suddenly joes mouth was dry he
licked his lips

  its a fake he whispered the
whole things a fake

  sure said the man nodding
grinning its a fake but interesting
entertaining want your past read
mister

  joe backed away no he said al-
most whispering

  only three credits wheedled the
woman cringing beggarlike but looking
at him with glittering eyes let me look
into the crystal ball let me read what
might have been if-

  if joe was hypnotized

   if youd taken any other action at any
point in your life if youd moved along
another probability line if instead of
studying one field youd studied another
and so affected your whole existence
if youd killed the man you felt like kill-
ing not done the thing youre sorry you
did loved another woman instead of-
what do i do said joe it came
from his throat like a whisper

  they sat him down he put both
hands on a small metal plate before the
crystal ball and they flicked a lever

  your fingerprints said the man his
eyes bright then they put a metal band
around his head fitted the electrodes
your brain pattern said the man
grinning again we need data

  mumbo jumbo said joe trying to
scoff

  hey did other things to the ma-
chinery then they switched a lever

  look into the crystal ball said the
man as the room grew strangely dark
and the ball began to glow which if
do you select

  suppose said joe in a thick and
trembling voice i hadnt proposed to
ann

  the man and the woman suddenly
laughed wildly joe started to pull the
band off his head to stand up and shout
at them and threaten to have them ar-
rested but he stopped dead because an
image was forming in the crystal ball

    there he was seated in a living room
 his present living room except that the
 curtains were blue instead of chocolate
 brown and opposite him was a woman
 who wasnt ann she was dark instead
 of blonde but aside from that there
 really wasnt much difference because
 the woman was pudgy unhappy and
 patient

 a nd she was looking at him with
 anns unhappy resolution his
 tiny image was ignoring her and he was
 glumly reading a newspaper

   thats what youd be doing right
 this moment on the other probability
 plane said the gypsy man

   b-but she-shes just like-

   the gypsy womans laugh shrilled
 maybe you make them that way she
 cackled

    swiftly she flicked a lever switched
 another turned a dial

   parallels she chanted search the
 parallels let me know mister when you
see your present wife and ill stop the
machine

    in the crystal ball fast five-second im-
 ages came paused disappeared im-
 ages of all the people affected by the
 new if joe screamed as ann appeared

   stop-stop

   his mind reeled it was ann in the
 crystal ball and yet it was not ann she
 was beautiful glowing clad in furs she
 was on a stage before applauding thou-
 sands holding a bouquet of roses smil-
 ing her gratitude waving her thanks
 graciously and beside her was a man
 imposing handsome and laughing the
 man suddenly kissed ann and she clung
 to him happily as the crowd went ab-
 solutely wild

   w-what-who- stammered joe

   i dont know said the gypsy
 shrugging she sure looks better off
 doesnt she too bad if only you
 hadnt proposed to her-

    its a fake screamed joe

 	he tore off the metal band and fled

    when he came home in the early after-
 noon he brought a large bouquet of red
 roses

  ad - man had at last

  	pinned down happiness he no
  longer visualised it symbolically as a
  bluebird that was forever flitting just be-
  yond his reach he visualized it solidly
  as a house and his status in his society
  was commensurate to the number of
  bricks or the number of board feet his
  house contained

     now if a society which reveres beauty
  respects artists and if a society which
   reveres ideas respects philosophers a
  society which reveres buildings cannot
  fail to respect builders add fo this
  propensity the incontrovertible fact that
  real estate values had been on an upward
  spiral for the past two hundred years
  plus the equally incontrovertible fact that
  construction unions had been growing
  progressively stronger for a similar

length of time and you have some con-
ception of the aristocracy which flour-
ished during the latter part of the twen-
ty-second century

-ibid p 

 athy met the thoreau one satur-
day morning in may when she was
picking violets in the woods she picked

the poor girl and the rich mans son faced an age-old

problem  and each with a different idea of happiness

  

	startling stories

violets every spring and sold them in the
village that way she was always able to
buy a new dress for summer and her
pupils never had to be ashamed of her
when they attended her classes in the
ancient twentieth century school

  the thoreau was sitting by a small
stream reading a book he looked up
when she emerged from the underbrush
on the opposite bank good morning
he said

  kathys hair was as dark as april
nights and if you looked close you could
see blue skies deep in her eyes her
mind was prose and poetry she had
inherited her fathers books as well as
his vocation and she had read them
every one

  good morning she replied you
-you frightened me for a minute
im quite harmless the thoreau
said

  kathy was barefoot she waded
through the stream and climbed up on
the grassy bank the thoreaus hair
was quite long she noticed but he was
freshly shaven and he was wearing a
clean white shirt she glanced at the
book he was reading wordsworth
she asked

  he nodded  the wye above tin-
tern 

  i like that one kathy said   
 once again i see these hedge-rows
hardly hedge-rows little lines of sportive
wood run wild- 

   youre a school teacher arent you
are you going by my familiarity with
wordsworth or my rags

  neither your eyes betray you
theres something about them a hope
an aliveness that most peoples eyes
lack 

  thank you kathy said youre
very kind

  not kind honest    why dont
you sit down

   she hesitated a moment then dropped
down beside him on the bank youre
the first thoreau ive seen for a long
while she said

  were a vanishing species waldens
are rare phenomena in the twenty-second

century and besides its so much easier
to conform    my name is paul dar-
row

  im kathy gray

  im glad to know you kathy he
noticed the small bunch of violets in her
hand and he reached over and touched
them i know where theres a whole
clearing full of them he said want
me to show you

   oh yes kathy said she got to her
feet and he stood up beside her a
thought struck her i-i sell them you
know she said does that make a
difference i mean you neednt show
me where they are if it does

is gray eyes touched her thin face
her ragged dress her bare feet
come on ill show you he said ill
help you pick them

  he left the bank of the stream and
entered the forest kathy followed the
aisles between the trees were still damp
with dew and the forest floor was mot-
tled with sunlight the thoreau walked
with long graceful strides the sunlight
dappling his brown hair and his wide
spare shoulders he seemed acquainted
with every tree with every rise and fall
of ground

   the clearing was in a marshy hollow
it was like coming outdoors after a
purple rainfall and seeing the grass glis-
tening with myriad purple drops
why kathy gasped theyre beauti-
ful 

   i come here every day the thoreau
said he knelt down and began to pick
breaking the stems flush with the
ground kathy knelt beside him her
bare knees sinking into the soft wet
earth

  when each of them had picked five
bouquets apiece she stood up

  thats enough she said some-
one else might want to pick some

  no one ever comes here the tho-
reau said rising except me and now
you perhaps youll come again
perhaps kathy said

  his gray eyes met hers and she saw
how deep they were there was a re-
more stately mansions	

assuring quality about them a maturity
that contradicted the youthfulness of his
face there was another quality about
them too a quality that eluded her at
first and then shocked her when she
identified it for what it was-an almost
poignant loneliness

   he pointed across the clearing to the
opposite side of the hollow my cabin
is just over the rise he said would
you like to see it theres a small lake
almost at my front door-i call it wal-
den of course-and i have a collection of
books keats shelley byron-

  no-not today kathy said i
havent time

  all right his expression did not
change but she sensed his disappoint-
ment he handed her the violets he had
picked i hope you have luck selling
them he said buy a white dress
youll look lovely in white

  he could not have helped but guess
it had been so obvious yet somehow
she did not feel in the least embarrassed
she did not even drop her eyes ill
try to get a white one she said   
goodbye

  goodbye kathy

  she ran lightly into the forest she
paused once and looked back he was
still standing in the clearing the sun
misting his hair tinting his face with
quiet gold she waved and he waved
back and then she ran on again her
heart beating in rhythm to the soft
pounding of her feet

che had reached the village and was
 walking up the sunlit street when the
big floater drifted down beside her and
settled to the ground her eyes widened
when she saw the mortarson crest on the
gleaming door then rose unbelievingly
from the minuscule mortar box and tiny
crossed hoes to meet the brown eyes of
the young man behind the controls a
vision of the huge mortarson mansion
usurped her mind and she remembered
all the times she had walked timidly past
the high brick wall slowing her steps
when she came to the gate so that she
might glimpse the lofty brick faqade with

its haughty colonnades but most of all
so that she might glimpse the sacrosanct
mortarsons themselves

  and now for the first time in her life
she was within a few feet of one of them
-the heir apparent himself anthony
mortarson vi there was no mistaking
him she had seen his picture innumer-
able times in the society section of the
constructor and once she had seen a
close-up of him on a televised mortar-
son fox hunt but seeing him in person
was quite a different experience from
seeing either his animate or inanimate
image

  what beautiful violets are you sell-
ing them

  her eyes dropped from his blunt
aristocratic face to his tailored denim
jacket she raised them diffidently to
the golden insigne on his white brick-
layers helmet as though to reassure her-
self of his reality yes-yes sir she
murmured

  id like to buy them there were
crisp green credit notes in his hand 
if you like sir

  how much for all of them
theres no fixed price sir what-
ever you care to give

  he held out three of the notes she
accepted them and gave him the violets
their hands touched briefly and it was
as though the contact had activated a
reciprocal emotional circuit kathy for-
got the suburban street she even forgot
that she was a school teacher and she
was unaware of the curious stares of the
passers by she was cognizant of noth-
ing but the opaque brown eyes of
anthony mortarson vi

  when he spoke his voice was differ-
ent it was deeper now and his words
trembled ever so slightly what do you
do evenings he asked

  sometimes i go walking sir
  where

  usually on the old turnpike west of
town

  will you be walking there tonight
  if you wish sir

  ill look for you    around nine
  yes sir
	startling stories

  the moment ended then the floater
quivered began to rise kathy watched
it ascend into the may sky make a wide
leisurely turn and dart southward to-
ward the mortarson mansion   

  her first reaction was to reject the
incident entirely princes might court
peasant girls in fairy tales but in real
life thev passed disdainfully by them on
white chargers or over them in black
floaters and went calling on princesses
or plumbers daughters then she re-
membered the credit notes in her hand
incredulously she counted them

  there were more than enough for a
new dress and she ran as fast as she
could to the mortarsonville shopping
center and bought the first white one
she saw she could hardly wait till she
got home and tried it on she lived on
the outskirts in a ramshackle five room
bungalow with an anachronistic veran-
dah and a leaky roof wind-washed
maples stood in the cool front yard and
there was an apple orchard in the back

  breathless she stood in her bedroom
and surveyed herself in the cracked mir-
ror the thoreau had said that she
would look lovely in white and he had
been very close to the truth but she
thought of him only fleetingly as she
compared the smooth darkness of her
shoulder-length hair to the dazzling
cascade of the dress instead she thought
of anthony mortarson

ii

k athy walked along the turnpike
slowly watching the violet shadows inch
down from the hills listening to the
drowsy bird calls that sounded from the
forest green fingers of grass reached
up through the cracks and fissures in the
crumbling macadam brushing her bare
feet above her hoary elms and maples
met in rustling consultation

  the turnpike had no function in the
year  it was a remnant of a dif-
ferent era it still wound through hills
and mountains crossed deserts and
struggled through forests it even
touched a town now and then and some-

times even a city but essentially it had
been dead ever since the first mass pro-
duced anti-grav floater had rolled off
the assembly line and risen into the sky

  once kathy knew it had flowed with
flashing vehicles the battered history
books in the ancient school had a great
deal to say concerning the automobile
age it was an age of chrome and
grandeur a fantastic age during which
it was possible to buy houses over peri-
ods of less than fifty years an incredible
age that supported an aristocracy totally
unversed in the building arts an impos-
sible age during which school teaching
was a respected well paying vocation

  sometimes kathy didnt believe the
history books sometimes she would
have the feeling that she was reading lies
at such moments she almost believed
that her vocation was just as non-essen-
tial as everybody said it was that the
visio-audio techniques of trade and
technical institutions really had obviated
any need of books and teachers and that
history literature and the humanities
were detrimental to a progressive tech-
nological culture

  but literature always restored her
faith she didnt call it literature out
loud of course-only to herself aloud
she was always careful to use the same
word though not the same tone of
voice that other people used readin
but underneath it was literature just the
same underneath it was still shake-
speare and milton and swift and dryden
-everything her father had read to her
and everything she herself had read
during the long quiet evenings after his
death   

  night had nearly fallen when the
floater descended its landing lights
caught kathy in their glaring focus and
it drifted down beside her hovering just
above the macadam her heart was
pounding painfully she hadnt really
thought that he would come and now
that he had she didnt know what to say
she stood there taut and frightened
illogically ashamed she wished sud-
denly that she were home safe with her
books but when he opened the door and
more stately mansions



she saw his face handsome and reassur-
ing in the roseate light of the control
panel she slipped into the seat beside
him

  he rose to cruising level immediately
and the earth became a vast dark mass of
hills and valleys inlaid with the jeweled
lights of villages kathy could hear the
rushing sound of the night wind past the
open vents and she could feel its damp
coolness against her cheek in the dis-
tance the city showed an orange fire red-
dening the horizon

  they flew for miles in silence final-
ly whats your name he asked
kathy sir kathy gray

  mines tony i guess you knew
that

  yes sir

  not sir tony 

  yes tony

  he reached forward and depressed
one of the innumerable lighted buttons
on the control panel subtly the cowling
shifted from opacity to transparency the
stars leaped out bright and stabbing
against the deep dark immensity of the
sky

  oh how beautiful kathy gasped
theyre real bright tonight tony
said ever been to a sky-bar

  no

  well stop in one after awhile e
know a nice quiet one nice atmosphere
nice music-

  oh im afraid i couldnt sir
  why not

  i-t have no shoes the night wind
was cold against her hot cheek she
wished desperately that she had not
come

  after a long moment he laughed soft-
ly well what do you know he said
so youre the village schoolmarm

  i-i took it for granted that you
knew i shouldnt have im sorrv sir
my name is still tony

  im sorry tony

  well dont he i didnt reallv want
to stop in a sky-bar anyway its nicer
just flying around

  kathy was silent values whirled be-
wilderingly in her mind up until a mo-

ment ago she had never seriously ques-
tioned her status quo there had been a
serene sense of rightness about carrying
on her fathers work no matter how
hopeless the task seemed at times no
matter what people said behind her back
her house was built of books not bricks
and until now she had always measured
her wealth accordingly

  but now her house was tottering

rphe orange fire of the city had become
a white cold blaze of lights sky-bars
began to appear swimming like gaudy
islands in the night sky skytels were
floating precipices aflame with windows
and sky-signs obscured the stars with
multicolored commercials

  air traffic thickened and tony flew
slower shift change was in progress
and thousands of commuters were hurry-
ing back to their mortgaged brick or
clapboard castles the city blazed bright-
er and brighter its white flames of build-
ings licking the feet of the disdainful
stars when they reached the outskirts
tony put the floater into a wide u-turn
and they started back

   kathv kept glancing over her shoulder
she had never seen the city at night be-
fore and she was fascinated she did not
notice at first that the floater was gain-
ing altitude when she did notice she
located the altimeter on the panel and
followed its quivering indicator with her
eyes    - the
indicator hesitated then steadied at -
 beneath the glowing numerals were
two tiny words leaning forward she
made them out parking level when
she leaned back she felt tonys arm
against her shoulders

  my pretty little schoolmarm he
said

   kathy sat very still her hands clasped
tightly on her lap love-making in her
mind was a jumble of moonlight and
gardens and tennysonian passages and
such a conception necessarily fell far
short of the exigencies of the moment

  whats the matter youre as cold
as mortar
startling stories

 

  am i

  look at me kathy

  diffidently she turned her head his
face was unreal in the starlight it grew
closer blurred suddenly a sense of
wrongness pervaded her and at the last
moment she turned her face away his
lips brushed her cheek

  she sensed his instant anger heard it
in his words dont play games teach-
er i dont like to play games his arm
tightened around her shoulders and he
turned her head forcibly with one wide
calloused hand his face descended
again

  kathy twisted violently his lips
brushed her cheek for the second time
and she heard the hoarse sound of his
breathing she disengaged his arm and
moved as far away from him as she could
on the narrow seat take me home
sir she said 

  just who in hell do you think you
are his voice had tightened and
grown cold

  im kathy gray

  youre kathy gray and do you
know who i am 

  anthony mortarson vi sir

  and you still want me to take you
home 

  yes sir

  he opened his mouth as though to say
something more then he closed it ab-
ruptly he turned toward the control pan-
el and jabbed the acceleration and alti-
tude buttons simultaneously the floater
dropped giddily to cruising level picking
up momentum wind screamed past the
vents and the white blaze of the city
dwindled to red embers on the horizon

  he did not take her home instead he
dropped the floater down to the section
of the old tunfpike where he had picked
her up he opened the door get out
he said flatly t dont know what world
youre living in but go back to it and
stay you dont belong in this one

there are non-conformists in every
community the non-conformists of

mortarsonville lived on the fringes of
the village and managed to subsist on
small farms despite the fact that agricul-
tural corporations made individual farm-
ing precarious that in itself was enough
to set them apart from their fellow men
for mortarsonville like most villages
was a suburb in disguise freed from the
citys skirts by the high speed and ex-
treme maneuverability of the floater and
land in the eyes of the suburbanites was
something pleasant to look at not soil to
be tilled

  farming however was merely a mi-
nor aberration in the behavior pattern of
the non-conformists of mortarsonville

  it was rumored for instance that they
read books of evenings and that one of
them maintained an amateur playhouse
in his barn and it was a known fact that
they did not believe that trade and tech-
nological institutions completely fulfilled
the needs of education it was this final
heresy that led to the ultimate aberration
that officially stamped the lot of them
as outcasts

  they sent their children to school

t athy arose early monday morning
and fied breakfast she wasnt
very hungry and she picked disinterest-
edly at her eggs and bacon she drank
her coffee while she did the dishes then
she packed a small lunch and started out

  it was a fine may morning grass
glistened wilth translucent dew and the
new leaves of elms and maples quivered
ecstatically in the first sweet breath of
the nascent day in the village proper
the roof doors of garages were opening
and commuter-floaters were rising into
the blue sky darting off to keep their
rendezvous with industry behind ste
reotyped facades housewives were set-
tling comfortably down in viewing rooms
to await the first sensual and on geo-
metric lawns and amid disciplined
hedges small children were setting out
in imaginary pursuit of the traditional
enemies of western civilization in-
dians sheepmen and martians

  to reach the school kathy had to pass
more stately mansions



through the shopping center ordinarily
she did not mind but this morning she
was acutely aware of the averted eyes of
the shop keepers of the occasional con-
temptuous glances of the early morning
shoppers and for the first time in her
life she was ashamed of her bare feet

  the constructors trust building
seemed even more austere than it usually
did and she walked past it quickly she
came to the lavish grounds of the local
technological institute and she kept her
eyes down so that she would not see the
shining modern building or the bookless
students strolling along the winding con-
crete walks beneath the unacademic elms
finally she came to the unused side street
and turned down it toward the school

  the school was over two centuries old
but fortunately it had been a well-built
structure the foundation was still solid
and the walls still true most of the win-
dows were shattered of course and the
heating unit had long ago gone awry
but the building was serviceable enough
during the warm months and if you real-
ly wanted to teach you could teach as
well in spring and summer as you could
in winter

  her pupils were awaiting her-all
nine of them they had taken their seats
behind the archaic little desks in the
room she had set aside to conduct her
classes in it was by far the best pre-
served room in the one-story structure
and its southern exposure conveniently
solved the lighting problem two of its
blackboards were in reasonably good
condition and on the mildewed wall
above kathys desk there was a recogniz-
able portrait of charles william eliot

  usually kathy was proud of her pu-
pils she was proud to be their teacher
and proud to receive each week the small
stipend which was all their parents could
afford to give she enjoyed walking into
the classroom each weekday morning and
seeing their scrubbed shining faces and
their bright inquisitive eyes

  but this morning she was not proud
this morning their faces left her indif-
ferent and there was a quality about
the drab room that had been absent be-

fore-a quality that chilled the warmth
that pervaded her when she touched the
old books that canceled out the enthu-
siasm that leaped into her mind when she
opened the first treasured volume

she began the lessons listlessly she
was unprepared when nora the
youngest of her pupils cried  theres a
big floater outside miss gray and a
mans coming up the walk

  kathy managed to retain her outward
composure but it was hardly more than
a flimsy veneer behind which her emo-
tions romped like irrepressible children
she met him just outside the main en-
trance he had his white helmet in his
hands and he kept twisting it around and
around there were scattered specks of
gray mortar clinging to his tailored den-
ims and tiny globules of perspiration
gleamed on his wide forehead good
morning he said

  good morning sir

  i know youre surprised to see me
but ive been thinking about what i said
the other night and-

  you said i didnt belong in this
world kathy interrupted and you
were perfectly right

  no i wasnt i had no-business say-
ing that at all with a shock she saw
that his eyes were contrite that there
were faint shadows beneath them
you belong here as much as i do its
just that you think different    youre
the first schoolteacher i ever knew
thats hardly surprising sir our
social levels arent exactly on the same
plane

  kathy im trying to apologize its
not easy

  oh kathy said i didnt know
i guess i took a lot for granted the
other night too much for granted
none of the other girls i took out acted
like you i mean most of them were so
proud to be with a mortarson they-
he paused his face reddening

  its not that i wasnt proud to be
with you sir its just that-

  its just that youre different thats


startling stories

all  can i see you again 

  kathy was speechless the classical
poets whose love lyrics formed the basis
of her sex knowledge had neglected the
most important aspect of their subject
psychology consequently she was com-
pletely uninformed on the finer points of
the game and failed to realize that in re-
pulsing anthony mortarson and thereby
disfiguring his self-image she had done
the one thing most likely to guarantee
his continued interest in her

  you will let me see you again wont
you kathy 

  why-why i guess so sir she said
finally

  tonight

  if you wish sir but i have to be in
early i have classes tomorrow

  tonight then his face was radiant
ill pick you up at your house no
dont tell me where it is-ill find it all
right he put his helmet on i have
to get back to work now he said
goodbye kathy

  goodbye sir

  she watched till the floater was a bare-
ly discernible speck in the sky then she
returned to the classroom and resumed
the lessons but she read the printed
words like a stranger and the yellowed
pages were dead beneath her fingers

jfune came warm winds flowed
northward and soft rains fell the green
of trees and grass took on a deeper hue
and the night skies exhibited a new
wealth of diamond-bright stars june
and then july cicadas began their aft-
ernoon crescendoes and the evenings
were cloyed with warmth when she
flew with tony in the floater kathy
opened the vents wide and let the cool
upper air wash over her they were fly-
ing together everv night by then start-
ing out with the first star and returning
when sagittarius was showing high in
the south 

  it wasnt until early in august that
she saw the thoreau again

tt was a friday evening and she was
sitting on her veranda steps listening
to the first night sounds and watching
for the first star she was wearing her
white dress

  the thoreau came up the path that
wound among the maples she did not
recognize him for a moment she had
almost forgotten him

  good evening kathy he said

  she remembered him then his young
yet oddly aged face his gray questing
eyes  his tall lean body why   good
evening she said

  i gave up hope youd ever come back
for more violets and then i started
hoping you might come to see my cabin
and my lake he smiled a smile that
wasnt quite sure of itself finally i
stopped hoping altogether and tried to
forget you i couldnt

  but why not kathy glanced over
his head at the special place in the sky
where very shortly the first star would
appear i should think id be easy to
forget 

  he shook his head every time i sit
down to write i see your eyes and after
ive written your eyes away i see your
mouth and then i see your hair and
then your face and finally i see you run-
ning into the woods your arms filled
with the violets we picked 

  but i dont understand kathy said
what are you trying to write

  my own personal walden i sup-
pose

  but why who will read it
probably no one he took a step
forward then hesitated do you mind
if i sit down

  oh im sorry kathy said i
should have asked you

  he dropped down on the veranda
steps at her feet sitting sideways so that
he could look up into her face you do
look lovely in white he said

  thank you

  im going to put you in my book

  confused she dropped her eyes to his
face his gray eyes were guileless i-
im afraid i dont belong in books she
said

  you belong in mine

  i still dont see why youre writing
one

  someone has to write them else
they wont be written i thought youd
understand kathy

  but things are different now no-
body writes books any more

  i write them the thoreau said
books are a part of the past its un-
realistic to try to write them now its
like-why its like someone in the time
of hemingway chiseling out crude sym-
bols on a monolithic tablet we have dif-
ferent mediums of communication now
improved mediums 

  her voice trailed away when she real-
ized that he was staring at her for a
moment she was ashamed of her apos-
tasy and then abruptly she was angry

  yes its true she went on we
do have improved mediums of communi-
cation why should you expect anyone
to read a book when he can acquire a
technical education by practical means
when he can experience a sensual at the
flick of his finger when he can live
through any documentary he chooses
and we also have improved living condi-
tions available to anyone with sufficient
ambition to work for them people like
you and me are contemptuous of houses
not only because we lack the talent to
drive nails or lay bricks but because we
lack the courage to mortgage our lives
to pay those who do have the talent to
perform the task for us and we ration-
alize our incompetence and our coward-
ice by clinging to outmoded values by
reading the works of misfits who couldnt
accept the realities of their civilizations
either by running off into the forest in
imitation of a man who hated progress
who hated houses-

  who loved ideas    whats hap-
pened to you kathv

  nothings happened to me ive just
been thinking for the first time in my

life ive really been thinking

  thinking or rationalizing from the
other side of the fence

  she looked at him startled

  its not a secret he continued ev-
eryone in the village knows that anthony
mortarson is in love with you

  hes not kathy cried

  i think he must be the thoreau
said how could he help but be
youre the first real woman hes ever
known

  youre being cynical

  im being honest-something youre
not being when you say that youve been
thinking for the first time in your life
for the first time in your life youve
stopped thinking youve forced your-
self to accept a perverted system of val-
ues youre fawning at the feet of the
great god tech with all the rest of
them and youre rejecting an eternal
essential truth civilizations are built
of ideas kathy not of bricks or boards
or electrical appliances

  she glanced away from his face un-
able to meet his eyes she looked up at
the sky the first star was just coming
out a timid whisper of light she saw
the descending floater then and she stood
up hurriedly i have to go now she
said

  the thoreau rose beside her youre
a schoolteacher kathy he said softly

  kathy ignored the remark the float-
er had come down in the front yard and
was hovering just above the grass im
sorry to have to run off like this she
said

  ready kathy tony mortarson
called	

  im coming she said she looked
up at the thoreaus face goodbye
she said

  goodbye kathy

  she ran lightly to the floater and
slipped into its reassuring depths just
before they rose into the night she caught
a final glimpse of the thoreau standing
by the steps he stood there quietly his
face a white blur in the intensifying dark-
ness there was a quality of aloneness
more stately mansions	

about him that was almost tangible but
there was another quality that tempered
it a quality of being a part of the night
of belonging to the essence of the earth
to trees and stars and darkness to the
blue sky to the rising sun and the dew
on dawn grass to love and hope and
idealism to a world disdainful of the
transient edifices of man contemptuous
of the brick and mortar frills of civiliza-
tion

i didnt know i had a rival tony
said

  dont be absurd darling that was
just a thoreau

  a thoreau

  you know one of those men who
live in the woods

  kathy i cant understand you as-
sociating with anyone like that

  i-i met him last spring kathy
said i never saw him again till tonight
he stopped by and asked if he might sit
on the steps i-i couldnt very well
say no

  next time youll be able to

  i dont understand

  kathy t want to marry you

   she sat there numbly unable at first
to speak the stars spread out lavishly
above her and the dark earth lay below
there was no sound but the wind sound
and the wild throbbing sound of her
thoughts she found words finally inane
words that stumbled when she spoke
them that had nothing whatever to do
with her heart but-but you cant
she said

  whv cant i

  i-im a schoolteacher did you
forget and youre a mortarson

  he laughed softly i told my father
all about you kathy i even told him
how t feel about vou

  tonv you didnt he must have
been furious

  he was kind of upset but he calmed
down after a bit and finallv i convinced
him that the least he could do was to
meet you so sunday morning im go-
ing to take you over to the house once
he sees you he wont be able to say no

  but tony i cant go to your house

i havent-

  oh yes you have he reached into
the compartment beneath the control
panel and produced a rectangular white
box open it he said i got the
smallest ones i could find

  they were fragile white shells tapered
to exqnisite points and garnished with
blue bows why theyre beautiful
kathy breathed

  try them on

  she slipped her feet into the shoes
diffidently they were soft and cool and
delightful she felt like cinderella she
laughed shyly to herself like cinder-
ella  she was cinderella

  kathy you will marry me wont
you the kings son said

  i-i dont know what to say i need
time to think

  ill give you till sunday will you
tell me then

  yes kathy said ill tell vou

i discussing the values of the
late years oj the twenty-second century
an old quotation comes ironically to
mind it is accredited to an ancient king
alfonso of aragon and constitutes his
conception of the four best things of life
old wood to burn old wine to drink
old friends to converse with old books
to read

-ibid p -

rphe house was an architectural pot-
a pourri originally it had been a sim-
ple four-storv structure but now it was a
complex affair of too manv wings and
ells a plethora of chimneys gave it a
byzantine effect and an imposing loggia
running the entire length of the facade
superimposed an incongruous american
colonial motif lawns and parks encom-
passed it and behind it half a mile dis-
tant was a well-stocked hunting forest

  kathy felt uncomfortable the moment
she stepped from the floater onto the
lawm the colonnades of the loggia rose
awesomely above her white and glaring
	startling stories

in the morning sunlight tony took her
arm and helped her ascend the brick
steps he opened the door for her
dont be afraid he whispered

  the great hall was cool and fore-
boding kathy felt very small almost
she wished that she hadnt come the
living room was at the end of the hall
it was huge and dim the morning sun-
light filtering into it through green-tint-
ed glass-brick windows the walls were
done in ornamental brick and a thick
red rug with a brickwork pattern cov-
ered the floor there was a tremendous
fireplace to the right of the door be
fore it in a voluminous armchair an
old man was sitting piles of books
were scattered all around him

  tony cleared his throat good mor-
ning sir

  the old man turned his head he was
very old kathy saw his first four wives
had given him only daughters and he had
had to take a fifth before obtaining a
fitting heir his face was round and his
features blunt his short arms terminated
in square gnarled hands the hands
were holding a book an old old book
kathy almost gasped when she glimpsed
the title the odyssey

  he looked at kathy this is the
one he asked in a deep dissonant voice

  yes sir tony said kathy this is
my father

  how do you do sir kathy said
shes a pretty one ail right the old
man said he continued to look at her
with small rheumy eyes it was a warm
morning but there was a fire burning in
the hearth it was a smoky fire and gave
forth a peculiar pungent odor

  presently the old man dropped his
eyes to the book in his hands he riffled
the pages absently then deftly he tossed
it into the fire the yellowed pages flut-
tered wildly just before the flames caught
them he procured another book from
the nearest pile when you get to be
my age you need a good fire to keep you
warm he said even in summer
kathy held herself tight her eyes
sought the title of the new book in hor-

rid fascination complete poems mil-
ton yes-yes sir she said

  books are cheaper to burn than wood
these days the old man went on 
picked up two cord in the city yesterday
he threw milton into the fire

  words screamed in kathys mind as
the flames touched them

        

  to hear the lark begin his flight
  and singing startle the dull night
  from his watch-tower in the skies
  till the dappled dawn doth rise-

  well what do you think of her sir
tony said his voice calm and matter-of-
fact as though he were completely un-
aware that the world was breaking up
into little pieces and forming a new as-
teroid belt around the sun isnt she
everything i said she was

  shes kind of quiet the old man
said he picked up another book

  but shes not used to you yet shell
talk after shes been here awhile wont
you kathy

  kathy was staring at the new book
trying to make out its title it was a
thin leather-bound volume the gold let-
tering on its spine nearly obliterated
the poems of oliver wendell holmes
kathy did you hear me

  she turned toward him slowly yes
she said yes i heard you she left
his side and walked over to the chair
where the old man was sitting she took
the book from his hands excuse me
sir she said but before you burn it
theres a passage id like to read to you
she opened the book her eyes
scanned the pages till they came to the
deathless lines her voice was rich and
full and the resonant words filled the
room cheapening the tawdry brickwork
with their quiet dignity

 build thee more stately mansions

o	my soul

as the swift seasons roll

leave thy low-vaulted past

let each new temple nobler than the
last
more stately mansions

shut thee from heaven with a dome
more vast

till thou at length art free
leaving thine outgrown shell by lifes
unresting sea 

  the room had become a tomb and the
old man sat like a cadaver in his chair
surrounded by his cairns of books kathy
laid the thin volume on his lap here
she said you can burn it now  i
dont want to marry your son i could
never live in a house of bricks

  tony stood like a gray guardian at
the door of the tomb kathy paused be-
fore him she looked once more into his
eyes realizing for the first time that
they were empty that there was no sun
in them no sky that there wasnt the
faintest vestige of a dream behind them

  goodbye tony she said

she walked out of the house and into
the sunlight she removed her shoes
and left them at the base of one of the tall
colonnades then she ran across the lawn
her bare feet sinking into the soft cool
grass the guard at the gate looked at
her curiously but he did not stop her and
presently she was in the forest

  it was pleasant among the trees
beeches were colonnades in their own
right tall and blue-gray rising sedately
into the green mist of foliage the sun-
light was a golden treasure scattered pro-
digiously over the forest floor and
patches of blue sky peeped through in-
terstices of leafy branches

  when she came to the little stream
she waded through its limpid coolness
the clearing where the violets had been
still held the memory of a purple rain-
fall and a boy and a girl on their hands



and knees gathering beauty she as-
cended the rise beyond it her heart
pounding statuesque pines towered all
around her and the ground was resilient
with fallen needles when she reached
the summit the first thing she saw
twinkling between the trees was a blue
lake

  she descended the slope slowly the
pines thinned out and green grass began
she saw the cabin on the blue lip of
the lake and the garden just behind it
the thoreau was in the garden hoe-
ing

   when she came to the edge of the gar-
den she paused for a moment she
was afraid then when he looked up
and she saw his face she knew that it
was all right and she ran toward him
lightly seeing the loneliness fade from
his eyes when she came up to him and
feeling the warmth of his smile

a d - the depression
of  coincided with the pub-
lication of walden ii by an obscure
woodland poet while unlike the blue-
bird mans cherished house could not
fly away he discovered that his owner-
ship could and once his ownership was
gone he learned the true worth of his
values he needed new ones to supplant
them and walden ii supplied them

  the back to earth movement began
late in  and the return to literature
and the humanities followed soon after
the bluebird came into its own again
and man discovered once more that the
most delightful aspect of business was its
tendency to appear the moment he
stopped looking for it

can man build a better brain than his own

at a recent party the wife of a
university professor approached
me and asked dr gunther if they
invent mechanical brains nowadays that
can do the most difficult mathematical
operations why dont they invent the
brain of a housemaid that ought to
be much easier

  you are mistaken i said your
husband teaches calculus doesnt he
yes

  you see if we ignore the qualities
your husband has as a father husband
and citizen and concentrate only on his
ability to teach calculus it would be
much easier to imitate his brain than
that of a servant

  you dont mean to say she asked
incredulously that it is simpler to de-
sign a brain that does highly skilled
work than some mechanism that would
clean the house serve at the table and
fetch the children from school you
dont need much intelligence for that

  feeling a little uncomfortable i an-
swered i am sorry but you are wrong
again in cybernetics you must revise

your conventional conceptions as to what
is intelligent from the viewpoint of
the theory of the mechanical brain much
more intelligence is involved in doing
the work of a housemaid than in teach-
ing differential calculus

  i	shall never be invited to a party at
that house again

  this little conversation illustrates the
general misconception of the basic idea
of cybernetics however the intel-
lectual misorientation toward this new
discipline is not confined to the ama-
teurs it is rampant in scientific circles
too although there it assumes more
subtle aspects the present tacit as-
sumption of the scientist and scholar in
the cybernetic field is that the ultimate
aim of the newly-created science is to
design an exact replica of the human
brain-a greatly improved replica to
be sure that does its thinking faster
handles more details and is practically
error-proof never mind the functional
improvements structurally it will be a
faithful imitation of the human brain

  to me this seems a fundamental mis-

third in a series by a noted metaphysician


the soul of a robot	

conception of the general aims of the
theory of cybernetics misorientations
of this kind have frequently occurred in
the history of scientific thought let us
recall the most famous of all

  for centuries natural science was
dominated by the alchemistic aim to
distill the philosophers stone that is
the proto-materia or primordial sub-
stance out of which all things are made
this was clearly a misorientation of legi-
timate scientific intentions

  finally however a reorientation took
place alchemy became chemistry pres-
ent-day cybernetics is in a similar quan-
dary and has not yet found its proper
goal it cannot be the legitimate inten-
tion of the cyberneticist to duplicate the
human brain if not what should his
legitimate aim be

  to find the answer we must look at
the problem in a very unsophisticated
way no longer satisfied with the per-
formance of his brain man sets out to
design an improved replica of it well
once upon a time he was not satisfied
with the means of locomotion which his
legs provided either did he set out
to improve upon the leg mechanism
nothing of the kind they dont make
cars in detroit that have four six eight
or twelve pairs of legs with a mecha-
nism that makes them run faster than
any human or animal legs could ever
do instead man invented a new me-
chanical principle of locomotion the
wheel true when man first became
dissatisfied with his legs he dreamed of
elongating his steps grimms fairy
tale idea has found an extremely modest
realization in stilts but if you want to
go from new york to chicago you wont
use stilts-you prefer to take your auto-
mobile

cybernetics is still in that early
stage where it dreams about bigger
and better legs instead of wheels to
talk without allegory it is a misconcep-
tion to talk about mechanical brains in
terms of the human brain

  contrary to some widely held preju-
dices the human brain can do much

better what it is built for than any
of its mechanical imitations no matter
how much the latter may improve dur-
ing the next centuries yes i know
they do their calculations much faster
than i do but so does the man who
sells me groceries on the other hand

i	have lectured on the mathematical
theory of transfinite sets it would be
unkind to put the grocer to that test i
readily admit if it comes to the adding
up of grocery bills and similar mental
activities you cant beat the mechanical
brains-but they will never write a
hamlet generally speaking their
brain activities will never be of the crea-
tive kind

  however let us be a bit careful about
that generalization it goes without say-
ing that our human concept of human
creativity is limited to the possible
range of human spiritual activity we
do not know anything about the crea-
tive power of angelic or divine intelli-
gences on the other hand we might
say-if my readers will permit the tem-
porary use of theological terms-that
god has delegated a tiny fraction of his
creative powers to us now would it
not be possible for us to say that man
has delegated some of his own creative
powers to the mechanical brain he
has delegated them in order to be used
in a field in which man himself can
never be creative but where would
that be 

  we have pointed out in our preceding
articles that the human mind works on
the basis of a two-valued thought pat-
tern it is aristotelian in its character-
or contra-aristotelian if it lives in a
hypothetical seetee world-and it can
never transgress its two-valued limits
that holds not only for the rational
concepts of the individual intellect but
for all our irritational motives too even
all mysticism is two-valued the very
existential roots of man as manifested
in his sex life are two-valued there
is no third sex

  it seems very strange under the cir-
cumstances that we can calculate the
laws of three-valued logic perhaps it


startling stories

is not so strange after all since we can
only calculate them but can never em-
ploy them as our own brain-functions
however that which we can calculatc
we can build into machines and here
lies the proper destiny of all cybernetic
science not to build a duplicate of the
human mind but a non-aristotelian
brain that works along a three-valued
thought pattern such a design would
be creative in a very new sense of
the word it would possess delegated
creativity in so far as it could produce
thoughts of a three-valued structure of
which man is entirely incapable but
it would have them only by virtue of the
fact that man has built the necessary
laws into the objective mind of the ma-
chine

  the proper aim of cybernetics is not
the mechanical repetition of the sub-
jective personal mind of man or of
the contra-subjective mentality of see-
tee man but the creation of a new
kind of three-valued brain the aim of
cybernetics is the para-human brain i
shall therefore demonstrate how two
basic concepts of aristotelian logic the
negation - and the conjunction and
  would work in the three-valued
brain of a robot

  using the symbols p and q as two re-
lated statements the following is the
table of definition for and  as de-
veloped in the preceding article

    p        p     
true    false 
false   true  
  - p shall be read not p and by pre-
fixing - to p you can as the table shows
alter the value of p from  true to 
false and vice versa and may be de-
fined by the table

    p                    pp 
true    true   true  
true    false  false 
false   true   false 
false   false  false 
  we assume p and q to be two state-
ments  p-the sun shines and q-
the wind blows then the compound
statement the sun shines and the wind
blow is obviously true only if p and q
are true at the same time this is shown
by our table these two tables show
how the negative and the conjunctive
work in the human brain they function
as indicated in the mind of any man
because our brain is two-valued and
follows an aristotelian pattern how-
ever the genuine robot brain shall be
considered to have three values this
makes it obvious that it must have a sec-
ond negational pattern because the ne-
gation - permits us to proceed only
from value  to  and back again but
no further

  from this point on to stick to our
traditional ideas of true and false would
be difficult the reason is this we
are now introducing a third value which
subtly alters the meaning of value

	and  as well what is true for the
human mind is false for the seetee mind
and therefore has the combined charac-
teristic-it is true and false at the same
time it is to clarify this superficial con-
tradiction that the third value must be
introduced the complexity of the fol-
lowing tables it should be noted are
not meant to be grasped by either the
human yours or mine mind or that of
the seetee mind but only by that of the
mechanical brain for which all possibili-
ties become logically operable the me-
chanical brain recognizes neither human
nor seetee values as such it operates
only with posions of values within its
mechanism these positions are   and
 and in order to operate them together
we introduce a second table of negation
for the mechanical brain



 





 from now on we can proceed from
 value  up to value  in fact by com-

bining these tables we can produce any
value constellation that might occur to
the three-valued logic

  in order to find out what and means
for a robot mentality we develop a simi-
lar procedure for the table of conjunc-
tion instead of giving  and q two values
true or false from now on we shall
give them three this results in the fol-
lowing table 

pq
















 





 



 

 





  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  at this point you may ask how the
new three-valued number for p and q
was reached it is really quite simple
look again at the two-valued table for
the human form of conjunction you
will notice at oncc that we arrive at the
proper value-sequence for and in the
human sense of the word if we always
pick the highest number available in
the two independent columns for p and
q in the first line there is only  avail-
able for p as well as for q so we have
to take  but in all of the other three
lines there is always at least one  and
it is chosen according to our rule of
always picking the highest value num-
ber for conjunction now apply the same
value to the truth table for the robot
whenever the columns for p and q show
a  then take it if there is no  try to
get a  and only if neither  nor  is
available place the value  in the col-
umn for p-q as it happens this is the
case in the first line only

let me emphasize this do not try to understand
this tabic any more than you would try to make
sense of the ibm cards random slots or construct
a sonata from the roll of a player piano the table
merely represents a mechanical pattern which the
robot mind requires for its operations of the mean-
ing of and

stories

  thus far we might say that the dif-
ference between the human and the
robot brain-as illustrated by the im-
portant logical term and-seems to be
nothing extraordinary one might be
tempted to say that it is a difference in
degree rather than in kind as we now
have three values with which to calcu-
late it stands to reason that the defini-
tion of and should be a little more elabo-
rate nevertheless this is an erroneous
conclusion there is a difference in kind
the human brain is able to conceive
only one meaning of and we have given
it in our two-valued table in the first of
this series of articles we described the
concept of a seetee mind pointing out the
fact that a contraterrene in telligence
would think with a reversed aristotelian
logic consequently the conjunction and
would have an inverted logical mean-
ing for a brain created out of seetee mat-
ter but as we humans can conceive of
only one our own meaning of and
the alien rationality remains unapproach-
able so far as we are concerned

  on the other hand a three-valued ro-
bot brain is in a more advantageous po-
sition it can conceive of several mean-
ings of and we shall indicate the second
meaning of and by two dots  and
we repeat the preceding table with the
addition of the value column for the
second meaning

p  p-q p-q 
   l     
        
        
        
        
        
        
     -  
        
  now the question is how did we ar-
rive at the new column of values for
p- q again the answer is quite simple
remember we picked the values for p-q
in the order -- remember also that
the seetee mind has the positive  and
the soul of a robot	

the negative  values reversed com-
pared with any other brain therefore
we now reverse the position of the val-
ues  and  in the order according to
which we pick them for and in other
words p-q is defined by the value-order
-- that means the preference posi-
tion of  remains unchallenged but
wherever there is only  and  available
in the columns of p and q we now
choose  instead of  thus we arrive
at a different second meaning for and
this cannot be done in a two-valued
logic if you dont believe me-try it

  the two columns for p-q and p-q
describe the robotic and the seetee
meaning of and and show how both are
reflected in a three-valued mechanical
brain

  we humans do not think in three-
valued logical terms but if we make a
special effort we can conceive objectively
what the robot means when it thinks
three-valued p-q but we cannot con-
ceive of the seetee meaning of and it
plainly contradicts our logic take for
instance the second line of our table
there  has the value of  and q is 
but the value of the compound statement
is also  translated into non-symbolic
language this means if the sun shines
but the wind does not blow the com-
pound statement in seetee language the
sun shines and the wind blows is nev-
ertheless true for us this is manifestly
absurd it illustrates my remark in the
first article the seetee mind that we
humans shall never be able to contact
such an alien mind directly what a con-
traterrene being would think is sheer in-
sanity to us we recognize it as such
but in the case of the seetee aliens we
would not describe their brain function
as thinking

  there is but one way to get in con-
tact with a truly alien mind-with the
help of a robot mediator whose brain
pattern is activated by a three-valued
logic such a pattern has a much wider
scope and can include both of the invert-
ed aristotelian systems in a modified
form nevertheless a robot brain is not
capable of acting as a mediator between

terrene and contraterrene mentality un-
less it possesses a threefold capacity of
conceiving the term and-or any other
term that might be relevant

  so far we have learned the mechanical
brains own conception of and it is ex-
pressed in the value column for p-q and
indicates so to speak the mental person-
ality or soul of the genus robot but
this mechanical brain also knows the
seetee concept of and however that is
not enough in order to play the part of
the mediator between us and the seetee
mind our mechanical brain must also
have a precise conception of the human
idea of and our next problem there-
fore is to translate the aristotelian con-
cept of conjunction into terms of a three-
valued system of thinking this can be
done as follows in order to indicate
the difference between the seetee and
any other mind we reversed the order
of the two value  and  we thus ob-
tained the two preference orders

--

v--

  a further reversal of values will pro-
vide us with the preference order for
the human conception of and the next
logically possible exchange of value po-
sitions will place value  ahead of  we
thus obtain 

--

as the order in which the values are
picked for the human meaning of and

  we can now write down the compre-
hensive table which covers all possihle
meanings of and in a three-valued logic
this is logically cogent in a three-val-
ued logic disjunction can be reached by
negation only if you apply the operators
- and - together

it is impossible to explain within the scope ol
this article why the reversal of  and  is the
next logically possible step serious students of
symbolic logic are referred to my recent publica-
tion die philosophische idee einer nicht-aritotel-
lshen logik printed in the proceedings of the xi
international congress of philosophy brussels 
v-- in this essay the second and third con-
junctions are simply introduced through the appli-
cation of de morgans law we thus obtain

  the expression p defines the human
meaning of and examine the last col-
umn of values you will find that it cor-
responds exactly to the aristotelian
meaning of and we learned from the
two-valued table page  that and al-
ways has the value  whenever there is
a  in the independent columns p and q
only p - q in our three-valued table con-
forms to that rule in other words if we
follow the preference order of --
then the value  has overriding prefer-
ence over the other two values

each of the three conjunctional col-
umns indicates a different mental-
ity the first conjunction represents the
genuine robot mentality in using the con-
cept and the next indicates seetee men-
tality seen through the eyes of a me-
chanical brain and p-q finally provides
us with the meaning of the aristotelian
and-if the same is transposed into the
three-valued system of a robot brain by
the way it is interesting to note that
the robot concept of and agrees more
with the human than with the seetee con-
cept in p-q as well as p -q the com-
pound statement the sun shines and the
wind blows is true only if p and q
ie the single statements are inde-
pendently true at the same time this
however is an illusion if seetee intelli-
gences had designed the mechanical
brain they would say that the robotic
concept of and was similar to the contra-
terrene idea of conjunction p-q and
utterly dissimilar to the terrene idea

  it is not our business however to
describe how this would happen we are
here concerned exclusively with a de-

scription of the situation from the hu-
man viewpoint please take a look at our
three-valued table in all cases where
p and q have only the human values 
and the mechanical brain agrees com-
pletely with us it can not and never
will contradict us in all conjunctional
matters where aristotelian judgments
are involved it disagrees with us only
in cases where a third value is involved
this indicates that if a robot has a soul
it is different from the human

  the human soul or whatever goes
under that word expresses itself in an
intense feeling of personal indivisible
identity all our conscious life is fo-
cused in one point the self the i that
is why we beings of aristotelian or
contra-aristotelian mentality have only
one negation one concept of and of
or of implication of casuality etc a
robot soul however would be or-
ganized differently it would not be based
on identity but on fndentity in other
words it could shift the personal center
of its mental life and reconcile contra-
dictory viewpoints this would make it
the proper mediator between us and the
seetee mind

  we humans are not capable of dealing
with strictly contradictory viewpoints
and situations involving a third value a
jewish friend of mine once told me a
little anecdote which illustrates this

  a rabbi once discussed the prob-
lem of the human soul with three of his
friends the first being a confirmed ag-
nostic proved unequivocally that man
had no soul at all the rabbi said
you are right

  the second of the friends took over
and proved equally convincing that all
rational beings have souls the rabbi
nodded you are right too

  now look here interrupted the
third what sort of nonsense is this
they cannot both be right

  the rabbi sadly assented and you
my friend are right too

  there is in this anecdote an implica-
tion of a possible third value but we
humans do not have it the three-valued
soul is the soul of a robot

by thomas kersh

         fihe was crying and breaking things again a door
         slammed and i heard glass crash in our sleeping quarters

i had stopped trying to understand audrey three weeks ago

            in tact i also stopped talking to her wecouldnt pass the
            time of day without breaking into a fight and if i beat her
            again i might kill her then when the guard ship came to
            relieve us id be courtniartialed and kicked out of the service

           i had to keep my temper under control

           however this wasnt easy-especially every time i touched

she loved him-until she read his mind 


	startling stories

the gap in my front teeth with my tongue
the gum was still sore and the first-aid
kit had no tooth seeds audrey had seen
to that

  when she saw shed knocked out my
two front teeth with the oxygen bottle
she ran straight to the first-aid kit rifled
it and ground the tooth seeds underfoot
i wouldnt be able to grow new teeth un-
til the guard ship came and chewing was
uncomfortable as hell i blacked both her
eyes for that one

   kept hoping she would commit sui-
cide but i knew that if she killed her-
self shed make it look as if id killed
her and i would be punished for her
murder without the pleasure of commit-
ting it sometimes i suspected that she
was even trying to goad me into murder-
ing her just out of spite probably the
only thing that kept her from it was that
she wouldnt be on hand to see me get a
dishonorable discharge

  i didnt see how we could stand three
more months of it before the guard ship
came im a mild tempered guy and i
never had trouble with a space mate until
i was assigned to duty with audrey per-
haps because the others agreed to a sen-
sible sleeping arrangement without ex-
pecting to fall in love

poor little audrey she came into
space service full of poetry with stars
in her eyes and a heart so soft that i
couldnt help pitying her she had
dreams of living glory of the vast and in-
finite beauty of the universe it was al-
most a religion with her and its a won-
der that they didnt catch her tendency at
the service academy still the academy
makes mistakes

  audrey wasnt a bad kid but we
should never have been put together
under a plastic dome on a black rock in
the middle of an ocean as large as earth
fifty light years from the nearest oc-
cupied planet

  samm she was thinking you utter
bum

  i started to block my mind to keep
her thoughts out but i had to reply first
i shot back an image of myself holding

her upside down by the ankles and hang-
ing her lovely blond head on the floor
she started a telepathic shriek but i
blanked it out and enjoyed the silence

  i glanced at the universal time clock
in the center of the dome hanging just
underneath our small artificial sun it
was time to check the psi-scopes that
guarded the station out to a depth of one
light year i had to trace the circuits
mentally and make sure that everything
was in working order

  the worst thing of all was not au-
dreys disillusionment but the fact that
we were both telepaths thats where
the service really slipped up however
the disillusionment was real audrey
hadnt seen a single star or a square inch
of deep space since she got here but she
might have survived her disappointment
shed be serving at better stations in her
future tours of duty stations where the
isolation was not so complete

  here the planet was blanketed with a
layer of clouds  miles thick un-
breathable chlorine clouds at that

  it wasnt actually a planet but a moon
known officially as k--- the
largest satellite of the fourth planet of
a sun listed as k- it was medium-
sized red sun and i had seen it only
once-on the guard ship when we ap-
proached the system the planet was the
real reason we were there and it made
the red sun look dull by comparison

  it glowed in the sky like a huge ball
of pure phosphorescense which it prac-
tically was pitchblende planet they
called it in the service and it was one
of the most valuable prizes in the galaxy
a survey team spotted it over a century
ago and the academy engineers still
hadnt figured a way of mining it on an
economical basis

  tt was like having a closet full of
money that you couldnt reach because
the doorknob was too hot to touch no-
bodv had ever been within  miles
of the surface and the spy rockets that
were sent down hadnt shown too much
before the radiation knocked out their
electronics and drove them haywire
consequently no one yet knew exactly
audreys moon	

why the whole planet didnt go up in
smoke instead of merely glowing a pale
luminescent green

  this was our baby our job the first
month audrey and i slept together we
called the planet her moon we couldnt
see it of course but we knew it was
there filling a quarter of the sky above
our station on the planets main satellite
we didnt want to kill each other then
but that was over three years ago she
was so young and so full of happiness
that her dreams made me forget myself
and i was making love to her like a
mad poet promising to bring her the
biggest moon in the universe to strew
her path with stars to travel to the end
of time for her and to do other things
which would have astonished the high
command in the service come to think
of it she seemed to like it no matter
how ridiculous it sounded anyhow
that was when we re-named pitchblende
planet audreys moon

  but theres a limit to such flights of
imagination and nothing could hide the
fact-finally-that we were stuck to-
gether on a drab little station for four
years

tvhen the service was founded and
 crews had to spend long periods
alone in space one of the first rules was
that crew members should be man and
wife it seemed the only practical answer
to the problem of isolation for years at
a stretch living at close quarters and
never seeing anyone else

  it seemed th logical answer but it
didnt work man-wife teams had little
more luck than all-male or all-female
space crews the final solution was to
use a man and woman together but to
forbid marriage between them

  the way it w orked in the guard sec-
tion-which audrey and i and 
others belonged to-was a four-year tour
of duty starting at the age of fifteen
with a member of the opposite sex this
was followed by a years leave and an-
other four-year tour of duty with another
space mate since you were reasonably
sure youd never see each other after

your four years together it wasnt hard
to make allowances and live together in
peace usually it was a pleasant rela-
tionship and when a man retired at the
age of thirty-five after four tours hed
have some fine memories

  in spite of audreys emotional child-
ishness which i shared for a while we
might have had a smooth four years
if we werent telepaths the services
strictest rule aside from the ban on mar-
riage was that telepaths couldnt serve
together the danger of course is that
two telepaths will not be able to stand the
intimacy that their ability forces on them

  you can shield your mind at any time
but its an effort a strain its like hold-
ing your arms over your head all day
long a person just cant take it

  i just cant take it samm you bum
audreys thought probed through to me
it was getting harder to keep her out

  samm she had opened the door
behind me i pushed three buttons on
the psi-scope panel to keep it automatic
then turned around to face her

  the two black eyes i had given her
were no longer puffy hut the discolora-
tion was satisfying to see

  what cant you take honey  i said
sending a couple of obscene images

  audrey turned pale and a sick look
came over her face i was almost sorry
for her but i raised a blank in my mind
to keep her from knowing

  she covered her face with her hands
and her shoulders shivered as if she had
a chill the thin fabric of her blouse
shimmered in the domes light and her
arms were tan i could see where the
tan was fading under her blouse now
that we werent taking all-over sunbaths
any more

  im sorry i thought to her i might
as well try to make it easier and she
seemed defenseless its not our fault
that were telepaths

  tears ran between her fingers but she
suddenly drew her hands away from her
face and glared at me its your fault
you wont marry me she cried

  who wants to marry i said or
have a baby i like the service i want
	startling stories

to stay in it anyhow why marry
you hate me already what would it be
like after a few more years i was using
telepathy because i wanted to edge back
into her mind and find out what was
really going on

  i could never probe to the bottom jf
her motives but i caught glimpses of a
secret pleasure at the thought of breaking
the service regulations marriage with
a baby wasnt an end in itself for audrey
but a means of defeating the system
around us she wanted to tell the service
to go jump off the edge of the galaxy

   i caught only little pieces of this feel-
ing and im not sure she recognized it
herself but audrey was a rebel who
wanted her own little civilization she
even wanted to make everybody tele-
pathic id rather jump into a pit full
of monsters than live among telepaths
can you imagine knowing everybodys
innermost secrets  or even worse hear-
ing the million drab everyday thoughts
that occupy most minds most of the time
it would be like having to listen to a
mediocre radio program twentv-four
hours a day

  non-telepaths are convenient theyre
like radios with the power shut off and
its almost impossible to get into their
thoughts thats why its always safe to
have a telepath and a non-telepath as
spacemates they can have a normal
relationship without the friction that
arises when two people are thrust too
close together the telepath can take
care of the psi-scope and the other part-
ner can look after the remaining duties
of the dome theres always enough to
do to keep a healthy-minded couple from
each others throats

  i could never forget my first tour of
duty with evie i was fifteen and she
was twenty-five and i learned every-
thing she had to teach me-which was
a lot so gentle so understanding that
she was practically a psychoanalyst

  evie you want to marry her the
thought was so strong inside my head
that i jumped audrey had overheard
me again t shielded my mind at once

  now she was angrv the tears were

gone as well as her appearance of help-
lessness so thats why you wont
marry me she picked up the first-aid
kit which happened to be on the wall
near her hand and started advancing
toward me i edged back

  she raised her arm to throw and as i
tried to dodge i stumbled on the one-
step dais below the psi-scope the
metal-cased kit sailed over my head and
crashed into the glass screen of the psi-
scope it punched a ragged hole in the
screen and i ducked to avoid the flying
shards falling heavilv on the dais

  oh no audrey thought looking past
my shoulder then after a moment
well im glad you did now well be
apart

  what did she mean 

  i started to brush off the pieces of
glass and get up when t suddenly real-
ized that my shoulder was pressing
against the warning release under the
psi-scope i eased away with a feeling of
horror the warning would bring a
guard cruiser to the station within twen-
ty-four hours and if we didnt have a
good reason for the warning wed be
courtmartialed

  economy was a deadly serious matter
to the service it worked on a strict
budget and a cruiser call might cost as
much as  credits cruisers
couldnt come running any time a person
on one of the  guard stations
happened to be lonely the cost of the
service was so huge already that trans-
portation was kept to a minimum one
call every four years was all a station
could expect

  the service couldnt justify itself by
pointing to a clear and present danger
and therefore had trouble every time its
budget came up for passage in the fed-
eral assembly there were occasional
rumors about an alien civilization in an-
other reeion of the galaxy but so far no-
body had ever seen an alien above the
pollywog level there were also stories
about whole guard stations vanishing
but i took these tales with a grain of
salt

  one thing i knew for sure the
audreys moon	

smashed psi-scope and the warning but-
ton meant the end of the line in the serv-
ice halfway to my retirement-no over
halfway-and she had to try bouncing
a first-aid kit off my bead with a single
motion i rose and lunged for her aud-
rey audrey i went after her with
both hands visualizing death tortures
i opened my mind to let her see the mur-
der in it

  she whimpered and ran for the sleep-
ing quarters and locked the door

a udrey didnt come out again until
the ship arrived the cruiser
couldnt land but a two-man launch
came down through the chlorinated mist
i had given up trying to think of a good
reason for the warning and was resigned
to being merely dignified in defeat

  i was surprised by the quick arrival
of the ship which took only twelve hours
instead of twenty-four to answer our
call when i heard the domes pressure
lock click into operation x let audrey
know

  you might as well come out now
theyre here straighten the sleeping
quarters and try to look human for a
change

  the guards came in their space suits
still wet from the automatic spray that
washed off the chlorine i helped them
take off their helmets the older man
heavy set and bristle-headed introduced
himself

  im captain jayten he motioned
to his companion lieutenant gor-
man both had a friendly impartial
look and i took a deep breath

  whats the trouble jayten asked

  i told it to him straight including the
fact that audrey and i were both tele-
paths stationed together by mistake be-
cause some idiot in assignments had
dropped a digit as i talked jaytens
slab jaws tightened and his eyes grew
cold and distant the smile on his face
was unpleasant to see when i was
through he had only a few words to say
he didnt mention courtmartial but it
was written all over his face he or-
dered gorman to take charge of the

dome until replacements were sent and
i broke out the space suits audrey and i
would have to wear while walking from
the dome to the launch

  i tried to get into jaytens mind but
could catch no more than the usual glim-
merings of thought that escape from the
consciousness of a non-telepath

  audrey still hadnt appeared audrey
i thought dont- bother powdering your
nose lets go gel courlmartialed

  its not my nose she said its my
eyes the ones you gave me

  she did a remarkable job on them all
right at a distance her skin was fair
and undiscolored and she smiled shyly
at the craggy captain jayten for some
reason it made me want to slug her
again and restore my original handi-
work

the launch took less than half an
hour to bring us up to the cruisers
orbit the moons surface underneath us
was a roiling blue-green mass like a
vast puffy cushion the planet much
larger glowed above us like a pale sun
and at first i didnt see the cruiser be-
cause of the bright light behind it

  it swung in an orbit a thousand miles
above the satellite and when we got
nearer i could make out its number n-
it was an old-model six-man ship but in
perfect condition space ships always
looked bright and new if they never came
into contact with a planets atmosphere

  audrey sat on my lap in the two-man
launch the seat strap around us both
when the acceleration pressed her
against me it was like meeting her all
over again i had forgotten how warm
and soft she could be and i remembered
the first days when we were together

  the captains unfriendliness made me
feel a little closer to audrey and we
opened our minds to each other more
than we had for six weeks the captain
said nothing more than was necessary to
make contact with the gruiser and his
silence worried audrey as much as any-
thing she seemed more troubled by tbe
situation than id thought she would be
but it was hard for me to pin her down
her telepathic powers are different from
and better than mine

  i could never get into her mind when
she was asleep for instance but she
could head my dreams any time thats
how our biggest fight started she caught
me in the middle of fine dream about
evie and promptly tried to stuff an oxy-
gen bottle down my throat

  what do you suppose theyll do to us
she asked as we came on board the
cruiser and saw the other four guards
looking as grim as robots with run-
down batteries

  they wont do anything i said as they
showed us to a room the size of a coffin
except take us back to headquarters
there well be disciplined kicked out of
the service probably maybe we can get
into communications we zvont starve
but we wont skim the cream

   is that all she said

  the door had shut behind us and we
were alone the room was six by three
by six barely big enough for a double
bunk with food and relief tubes we
wouldnt need to undress

  no thats not all i said theyll
suspend marriage and procreation priv-
ileges for five or ten years not that
im in a hurry to marry anybody butit
might make a difference to you

  it did she went pale and i thought
she was going to cry

  but they cant she whispered her
eyes filling up with tears i didnt think
theyd do that

  in the academy she probably memor-
ized poetry when she should have been
reading the articles of war sometimes
i think she passed her exams by clair-
voyance

  samm she said ive got to do some-
thing i cant go back we didnt call
the cruiser on purpose

   it might be better if we had i said

  she closed her eyes and her face
turned uo as if she were trying to hear
something a light year away what-i
started to say

  she waved her hand and said shhh
im trying to get the electronic system
 i went into her mind and tried to fol-

low her but it was too complex she was
trying the other crew members digging
below the conscious level which was
practically silent to the mass of informa-
tional data underneath she didnt get
much but it was enough

    she came to life and opened her eyes
  yanked a hairpin out of her hair and slid
  back the door into the narrow corridor

    get a pair of space suits she said
  and disappeared what was she doing
  i followed to see

    the corridor was too narrow for run-
 ning but i sidled after her as fast as i
 could i saw her squeeze around a cor-
 ner that i estimated was in the middle of
 the ship and when i got to the corner i
 saw her reaching for the ceiling she had
 jabbed the hairpin in a crack and was
 pounding it with the heel of her slipper

    i grabbed her collar and jerked her
 back just as a muffled poof came
 from the ceiling a three-inch circle of
 metal melted away and a dazzling blue-
 white ball of flame swelled out of the
 ceiling panel

    by this time the n- was gaining ac-
 celeration for the dimensional jump that
 would last almost a whole day and bring
 us out near the service headquarters
 planet a sudden surge brought audrey
 down upon me and we both tumbled in
 the corridor i got my feet under me and
 scrambled away from the slowly swelling
 fire

    the ships on fire she thought hap-
 pily now we wont have to go back

    i pulled her along the corridor to our
  quarters where could i give the alarm 
  i didnt want to be roasted in space and
  i gave her a couple of images of what it
  would be like to fry and freeze at the
  same time

    dont ivorry she said the fire set off
  the alarm too they know about it
  theyll have to stop then we can take
  over

    take over what i said a cruiser
 blazing like a sky rocket

 but she was right acceleration sud-
denly stopped and we were coast-
ing in free fall someone clattered down

 the cdrridor and jayten appeared in the
 doorway his hair burned off and his
 eyebrows singed

    lie was wearing a space suit with the
 helmet back and dragging two other
 suits

   here he said put these on and
 follow me were going outside

     started to slug him and run for the
 two-man launch but his free hand was
 too close to his gun we had to play
 along for a while perhaps if we helped
 -and if they never found that audrey
 started the fire-the courtmartial would
 give us an easier time of it

   i followed him pushing the suits
 ahead of me in the corridor just by the
 escape hatch we had enough room to put
 them on and audrey and i struggled
 into the suits while jayten went outside
 another crew member was breaking out
 fire extinguishers and he strapped one
 on each of us

    is the fire outside i yelled

    started inside he said under one
 of the vanes but it caught the emer-
 gency fuel line and burned out through
 the hull he gave the strap on my ex-
 tinguisher another jerk and said weve
 stopped it in the fuel lines but one corner
 of the uranium pile is exposed

   the extinguisher on my back would
 spray a metal skin over the hull and the
 uranium pile so that they could patch up
 the ship and get their power plant
 shielded again

    t went first out of the escape hatch i
 jumped off into the blackness of space
 but misjudged the push i needed and
 spun away from the ship for a mo-
 ment i lost my bearings the radiant
 planet was directly ahead of me and i
 twisted back toward the n- which
 hung motionless against the stars fire
 had broken through the hull at the base
 of a vane and a large section of the metal
 skin was red two figures in space suits
 were already spraying the fire

    i could see the satellite much further
 below now and its misty softness had
 changed in the distance to a blue opaque
 shell the two space-suited figures were
 being driven back from the fire by the
 extinguishers reaction and they had to
 keep jockeying into position again

   i grabbed the oxygen nozzle and

pointed it behind me one squirt was
enough to send me scooting back toward
the n- three others were tumbling out
of the hatch and i knew audrey was one
of them i heard her voice in my head

  save some of the metal in your ex-
tinguisher she said i have a plan

  fine i didnt so i could tag along-
and stop her before she did something
drastic

  i maneuvered into place beside the
others fighting the fire and it didnt take
long to skin over the hull and get the
power pile under wraps again i didnt
empty my extinguisher and audrey
didnt explain

  but when we were through audrey
drifted to my side she raised the nozzle
of her extinguisher and pointed it tow-ard
the four men in space suits now examin-
ing the repaired hull

  spray them she said

  i pointed my extinguisher and let
them have it they were standing in a
group and one of them started to turn
in surprise but he never had a chance
we froze them in place like metal sta-
tues the liquid metal solidified the
joints in their suits and welded them to
the cruisers hull

  now what i said to audrey

  theres one more she said inside

  we started for the hatch and i wished
i had a gun the extinguisher felt use-
less now as i grabbed the edge of the
hatch the voice came

  not inside i stopped because the
voice didnt come from audrey behind
you

  i turned and saw the fifth man point-
ing a gun at us it was javten and id
lost track of him he could slice us in
two with a single shot

  that was a neat trick he said but
dont make me kill you i couldnt get
over the fact that he was a telepath but
i was thinking more about the fact that
the courtmartial would throw the book
at us now a mutiny charge perhaps
maybe i could put tayten out of action
long enough for audrey to get away   

  its time we told them another voice
said and i knew it must be one of the

other crewmen another telepath i
didnt have time to think because t was
already diving at jay ten he leveled the
gun at me and a white-hot wave washed
over my brain  heard a gabble of tele-
pathic voices and then blacked out drop-
ping slowly down into a deep wrell of un-
consciousness

soft hands were stroking my hair
and my head was pressed against
something warm and soft audreys
voice came in

  youre awake i tried to move but
my arms and legs were heavy and full of
sleep and my head swam dizzily

  where are we  my voice was rusty
and i had to clear my throat from the
artificial gravity i could tell the ship was
in motion again i opened my eyes to
the narrow cabin

  for answer audrey touched a but-
ton on the wall and a viewscreen at the
foot of the lnmk lit up it showed the
vast radiant surface of the planet and
we were plunging downward pitch-
blende planet-audreys moon-where
the radiation stopped all the scout rock-
ets that were ever sent down

  its simple audrey said they
explained it to me while you were
asleep

  while i was asleep that reminded
me why didnt i die i said

  jayten didnt shoot you theyre all
telepaths and they can hook up in a cir-
cuit to paralvze anybody they like

  that figured but why couldnt we
tell thev were telepaths before we
couldnt get more than a whisper from
them

  audrey patted me on the cheek like
she owned me and said theyve got
something we couldve used automatic
mind shields you dont have to be on
guard all the time she held up a
small plastic obiect the size of a bean
just slip it in your ear

  this i would have paid a years salary
for when we were fighting and getting
on each others nerves but i still didnt
understand why we were heading for
audreys moon why- i started to
say when jayten appeared in the door-
way

   because were not service guards he
said you might call us a new civilisa-
tion he looked friendlier now and the
harshness had gone away from his face
he sat down on the edge of the bunk
there are fifty thousand of us he said

tte explained that a group of
telepaths mostly persons tired of
the restrictions and discipline of the
service had been building up for the last
hundred years

   they lived on pitchblende planet
which glowed as if it were dangerously
radioactive but this was only an atmos-
pheric effect other telepaths in the
service had been careful to doctor the

nobody discovered there wasnt an ounce
of pitchblende per square mile

  they took care of all scout rockets
themselves

  audrey broke in they were watch-
ing us for years they heard everything
we said or thought

  i sat bolt upright in the bunk and
bumped my head sharply

  you mean to say they heard me
every time i    she blushed and i
looked toward jayten he was trying
not to grin

  he nodded and said right not me
of course because i dont go in for that
kind of thing mostly it was the women
they even started calling the planet
audreys moon

  darling they thought you were won-
derful audrey said you zvere pretty
good at first you know

  jayten stopped trying not to grin and
i felt myself getting hot in the face
matter of fact jayten said all the
women were in love with you the men
didnt like it and almost voted to keep
you off the planet

  this would bear looking into i de-
cided i faced jayten again but why
didnt you come out in the open before 
why the service guard act

  youd never have left the service
tf you werent in trouble jayten said
most people are like that we wanted
you to feel completely alienated to the
service and then we would have res-
cred you pulled you out of a jam any-
 dys glad to escape a courtmartial sen-
tence

  i nodded and he went on to explain
that the station hack on the satellite
would be destroyed and submerged as if
an oceannuake had broken up the basalt
island the warning hadnt gone through
to the service and it would be several
months before the regular guard ship
came to relieve us it all added up and
when jayten left us alone audreys face
was serene and smiling i even under-
stood now whv the cruiser arrived
twelve hours early and why there had
been rumors about aliens but i was

puzzled still about how things stood be-
tween me and audrey no more
fights i said looking up at her face
she smiled and kissed me

  no were getting married

  i kept my mind a careful blank and
took the bean-like thought shield from
her hand and put it in my ear now i
was safe why are we getting mar-
ried i asked

  for the same reason i couldnt go
back to be courtmartialed she laughed
for the same reason i started the fire
for the same reason i got angry when
you dreamed about evie ive got a se-
cret

  she glowed at me happily and picked
the shield out of my left ear listen
she said and pulled mv head against her
abdomen two months already

   at first i could hear nothing but then
i caught the faint sounds of an unborn
mind drifting lazily in a kind of sleepy
warmth

  i	dont remember what i said but it
was something like darling-why-didnt-
you-tell-me-this-before 

  audrey wept happily and said she had
tried but i was such a beast i agreed
and we hugged each other

  then i happened to glance at my
watch and saw it was bedtime audrey
had a faraway look in her eyes and said
we wont land on the planet for an-
other hour 

  the bunk was narrow but we didnt
even know the difference

weve been here four months now
and its not bad at all with the
mind shields we can have privacy when-
ever we need it and when we want to
be together as intimately as possible we
take off the shields and enjov ourselves

  were very happy that were going to
have a bov how do i know its a boy
ive talked to him of course he doesnt
have a good vocabulary yet but hes
learning in fact only last night i argued
with him for an hour to convince him
that its not so bad in the outside world
and that he ought to be born hes as
stubborn as his mother

a search for the reasons why things arc the
way they arc is not entirely true only in
part true it was a search for the reasons
why things are the way they are however
in the ancient religion the sun-god re a deity
was conferred upon the sun and was worshiped
as a god they used different rites and differ-
ent methods of worship but it was wor-
ship an adoring of a god

  even the modern religions ill even include
the bible are a search for the reasons why
things are the way they are perhaps i should
modify my including the bible actually it
isnt a search because right off the bat it gives
an explanation for the reason why things are
the way they are it explains not searches
but one could refer to it as science with re-
serve of course because it does explain why
and that the harmful human instinct involved
in religion is laziness is not true rather i
have found it to be the opposite evil or satan
has only to exist to put over its influence
where one says there is no god so i can
do a i please thats an easy way out but
for good or god to have any influence on
ones life there must and has to be an action
an active struggle going on in the person in-
volved

  religion does give a firm base for power in-
dividual or group power this power has been
misused and the misuse of it has been justi-
fied many times especially in the middle ages
in the r c church and the puritans and to
a certain extent at the present time but is
that the fault of religion itself no its the
fault of men -who use that power to feather
their own nest atomic power has done a lot
of harm since it has been invented but atomic
power itself is not harmful or to blame but
the corrupt minds of men who have used it
has made it that way it can be used to benefit
mankind in the same way religion is not
harmful but beneficial but men can make it
harmful

more on gunther

by richard h stott

  dear editor attention dr gunther and
your attackers your all lunkheads first dr
gunther wrote an articlc on ct beings but
really messed it up metaphysician haters blew
his argument to bits but they too missed the
meat of the subject

  i believe that i have the answer to this
whole stupid mess simple reversal of charges
in sub-atomic particlcs is as has been proved
not enough to reverse the subjects viewpoint
on the universe dr gunther you dont want
positrons and anti-protons they have been
discovered mr susan you want something
which is anti-matter if one thinks a hit he
will come to the conclusion that the only thing
anti-matter in the entire universe is space
even space has some of the properties of mat-
ter eg has boundaries can be bended and
so forth but it is the best our science can
provide

  so dr gunther the true ct matter would
have its electrons and nuclei consisting of abso-
lutely nothing sitting in an electrically charged
space as to the psychology of ct creatures
someone else may figure that out hope this
puts an end to this silly business which has
been going on for about three months too long
at this writing

  if this letter should see print theres a
phrase  just cant understand    how can

not servile

by edward c seibel

  dear editor i notice on your front cover
for this month fall that your advertising
department will go to any lengths to put your
magazine in the public eye if you will cast
your gaze into the lower left-hand corner you
will see imprinted on the rock on the moon a
thrilling public a tio n now
thats what i call a get-up-and-go advertising
department to advertise on the moon any
minute now those spacemen will come across
this sign and like all humans being suscep-
tible to the written word they will rush down
to the corner rock and buy a copy of ss

  lets be careful in our use of the word serv-
ile or words almost servile in connection
with my name webster defines servile as
slavish    fawning and nothing sounds
less like myself as you well know it was
merely a friendly gesture to put you in a
mood to read my story when i send it i had
given you more credit for intelligence per-
haps you were trying a bit of aggravation to
make me angry itll never work-you cant
anger me im always two thoughts ahead of
you

  i did read a story this time in your maga-
zine since i had some time to waste and didnt
know what else to do at the moment now
youll derive some benefit from my comments
about the story that i read i will say one

read all of tiie big



in science fiction



thrilling wonder stories
startling stories
and

fantastic story magazine

no
 thing it isnt at least one of those with me-
 dieval monsters in it where flomus flies into
 the sun on a fire-horse to capture glyddis if
 i want to read that sort of stuff id go to
 bulfinchs mythology which i assure you has
 a full program of such stuff only i never
 finished the book-it wasnt interesting it
 was just that some one swiped it though that
 i never finished it-p  box  olive-
 hurst calif

  youre right about the rock it was a
 good publicity idea but the toughest thing
 was to bring it here from the moon for
 schomburg to copy and then to get it back
 again the next day before anybody noticed
 it was missing gotta keep those moon
 readers happy

the editor speaks

 by peter j vorzimer

   dear editor that nice blue cover like the
 ribbon im using stood out brilliantly on the
 stf shelf today if it werent for that i
 wouldnt have seen ss sitting there as i
 stooped to pick up the latest mad comic
 however  found it-and found my name in
 it i paused for a minute and thought about
 it  my name in a copy of startling stories
    what an honor too bad it couldnt have
 been under a story

   you neglected to answer what i thought was
 an important question that i asked in my last
 letter i had asked you whether or not you an-
 swer personally all the letters that come in
 that you dont print i suppose your not an-
 swering that question rather answered it rath-
 er than neglected to answer it are you
 still with me

   those emsh and finlay illos tempt me if
 i ever stop being the fake-fan that i am and
 get down to reading that crud called science-
 fiction ill promise ill dig up my old sss
 and read those first its just me i cant help
 it but i just naturally turn to tev and start
 reading one of these days    who knows

   best letter by far this ish is by jim har-
 mon give that boy a medal im ordering my
 copy now

   by the bye if mckinney can plug her zine
 why cant i please can i sam pullllease

 i pub a zine called abstract its dittoed with
 offset covers and runs anywhere from  pages
 up to -and only lotf we both edit stf
 mags now sam and im tired of paying if
 i feven though it definitely is reasonable enuf 

 for ss-so why dont we trade
aha now there is ar idea think of all the
luscious fanzines youll get-like abstract
man im surprised somebody didnt think of
this before somebody did

   none of the articles i love thi time boy
 how on earth your editorial offices are on
 earth arent thev or is that n y address
 just a clever front do you expect me to
 keep buying ss if they dont run those

whos this again

by wm deeck

  dear editor youve done it again you
must have gotten thousands of letters from in-
telligent fans begging you to make me return
did you print one no the three people
who are my disciples and eulogists just had
their names mentioned followed by something
that you must have thought up yourself lies
vilifications and character assassination

  although i dont keep carbon copies of the
letters i write to you i did notice a slight dis-
crepancy  for instance you left out the part
about    no-id better not repeat the mis-
take

  thom perry could not have compared me
with fearless fosdick ff is too stupid the
person he was referring to was that cute
lovable little creature from okefenokee
swamp thoms typing must not have been
legible

  many many laughs this issue snarly is
back and hes being very coy hes going to
lead you on until your thimble of joy me
overflows then hes going to let you have
it-right in your posterior for that magnan-
imous deed all shall be forgiven-even his
stupidity

  has carol mckinney swayed you by her
proposal of marriage you gonna let her get
by saying those hideous things about me 
euthanasia is too good for her girls are
boy-crazy miss mrs mckinney theyre
taught just that as soon as they are bom they
learn their lesson well too

  brown go right ahead and say what-
ever youre thinking i am always glad to have
a chance to tell someone what i consider they
should know  for example i am now telling
vou that youre stupid join in on the fun a
great time is had by all-specially the referee
yon editor who pits one idiot against the
other hoping that the worst man woman
andor argument will win

  i shall write an article one day on how to
break into the letter columns of the sf maga-
zines there are so many ways you can say
you love the magazine and its editor and pos-
sibly with some editors you can say just the
onoosite also you can start an argument
with someone who said something particularly
stupid naturally the editor being too lazy or
not too bright he will print the letter so that
he wont have to argue i wm pronounced
wim darn rood namel deeck am a com-
bination of all thats why youre not going

to print this letter

  so rather than waste my time writing a
letter no one hut you will read  quit-
potomac avenue college park md

  so deeck has finally told us what he is
a combination of any other combinations
occur to anybody

send him some xeno

by victor paananen

  the schomburg cover was good-but of
course not as good as the classic on the april
ish

  i liked that kulik poem about the possibility
of neutrons electrons etc being little inhabi-
ted worlds the frightening thought of
course is that our own universe might be just
a mess of trons in a bigger world or uni-
verse now if that bigger world starts test-
ing a-bombs and our trons are in uranium   
oh im too young to die

  regarding the editorial i have just read
that conveyor belt sidewalks a la asimov and
heinlein are going to be installed between
railway depots in joisey and are a possibility
between times square and grand central in
n y c more extrapolation coming true

  now to review the least important part of
ss the stories

  the marriage manual why must mar-
garet st clair write so well i always have
maintained that women cant write good stuff
-so along comes m stc

  got my first fanzine-of which i under-
stood nothing at all a bunch of characters
and i mean characters-they even out-
deeck deeck argue about th th th fan-
dom-you mean these s-fers come in various
sizes

  ive never read a cap future story i guess
im just a poor unfortunate wholl go thru
life never understanding whats so funny
when somebody cracks about jugs of xeno-
 west th st ashtabula ohio

  what this man needs is not to read a
cap future story but to drink a jug of
xeno then he could reach the th th
and th fandom where the real folks live
but keep the stuff away from the man who
says he   

didnt see magazines

by johnny cardona

  dear editor i shall begin by explaining
my original purpose in writing this letter
first off i have been reading sf for the past
 yrs i am  but i never knew about
magazine form sf till last fall scuse me
while i kick myself again i had been read-
ing just hard cover sf books from libraries
primarily so i thought you might insert a
few lines in your next issue to let the read-
ers know that t would really appreciate any
back issues of any sf they would send me

i would be deeply grateful and the condition
of said books mean nothing horrible mutila-
tion of tlil- books would not lessen my pleas-
ure from them i love sf

  the preceding was my only purpose for

writing until but wait right

here let me tell you that this is the first letter
i have ever written to an editor probably
the only one

  thats the way my letter would have ended
had i not picked up my copy of ss today 
havent read any of the stories yet just the
letters in tev man that did it im dis-
gusted beyond explanation why because
im fed up with reading letters such as this
story is lousy that author is slipping etc
etc i dont consider it being a real sf fan
condemning a story because it isnt an acad-
emy award winner so to speak lets lace it
they cant all be gems story after story is-
sue after issue did irving rerlin or george
gershwin have a smash hit every time they
composed a tune after all theres work and
thought behind all sf stories and i find
them all enjoyable even if they arent the
greatest as for jack vauces story i cer-
tainly wasnt disappointed with it nor any
of the others right now my apologies if
anyone is fuming at me i really do enjoy
the letters in spite of my opinion

  and finally i would like to tell you that i
enjoy your comments as much as the letters
keep up the good work sure wish ss was
monthly tho- amelia ave scranton
 pa

  ps i would really welcome correspondence
with any sfer who cares to write

  no you definitely dont need any xeno
however i hope you get the magazines
most of the science fiction youll find in
hard cover books appeared in magazines
anyhow as for letters vve try to let people
have their say although we have to edit
and select carefully because weve got to
get in a good cargo of stories
