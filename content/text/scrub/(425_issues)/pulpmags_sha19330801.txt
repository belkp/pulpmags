chapter i

  cardona goes on duty

   the spacious lobby of the olympia
hotel presented an interesting study to
the man who viewed it from a corner
chair no longer a pretentious estab-
lishment the old hotel at least gained its
share of patronage nearly ail of the

chairs and lounge seats were filled and
many persons were strolling back and
forth near the desk

  the man who was watching from the
corner had chosen a spot which was
quite inconspicuous furthermore he
had successfully rendered himself un-
noticeable the collar of his dark-gray
coat obscured his square-set chin the


the shadow magazine

spread pages of an opened newspaper
aided in the concealment of his swarthy
countenance

  nevertheless the man was constantly
observant as he peered from under the
derby that crowned his forehead his
dark-brown eyes kept up an intermittent
vigil that allowed very little to escape
them

  hunched in the chair watching from
a gloomy spot wearing a type of hat
that he seldom utilized detective joe
cardona was effectively avoiding recog-
nition and at the same time taking good
measures to spot any one whose features
he might know the ace of new york
sleuths was living up to his reputation

  cardonas watchful eyes picked out a
small group of men who entered
through a revolving door the detec-
tives quick glance settled upon one in-
dividual-a heavy-built man of more
than average height whose chief item of
attire was an expensive astrakhan coat
as this arrival strode across the lobby
he half turned his head in cardonas
direction grinning at a companions
remark the man displayed a glimmer
of goldin his thick-lipped mouth

  cardona needed no further sign of
recognition this glitter from a full
heavy face was the identifying mark of
goldy tancred this was the man
whose coming the detective had awaited

  as goldv and his friends crossed the
lobby and entered an elevator cardona
remained more watchful than before
his eyes swept every portion of the
lobby they continually reverted to the
door through which goldy had entered

   at length satisfied by his inspection
cardona arose and strolled toward the
revolving door he turned as he neared
it tracing his steps so that only his back
could be seen from outside

   shifting the position of his derby the
detective slowly changed his course so
that it neared the row of elevators

  waiting for a car cardona spotted

the outer door from the corners of h
eyes he saw another man enter an
go to the seat which was now vacant 
the edge of the lobby just the trace c
a satisfied smile flickered on cardona
lips this arrival was another detectiv
who had come in response to cardona
signal at the revolving door

  ballroom floor announced carden
as the elevator ascended which wa
to the mohawk meeting

  over to the right sir responds
the operator the meeting is in th
blue room

  the blue room quizzed cardonz
i was told that the crowd met in th
red room

  they used to explained the op
erator as he brought the car to a stop
but they changed it for this meeting
go down to the right turn at the en
of the corridor youll see the door

  cardona followed directions the cor
ridor ran directly in front of the larg
ballroom which was not being used thi
evening at the end cardona immedi
ately discovered the door of the blut
room-an opening concealed by a blut
screen he could hear the chatter am
guffaw of loud voices beyond the bar-
rier

  passing the screen the detectiv
looked in through the door at an angle
he spied a waiter and beckoned to the
man he drew the attendant out be-
yond the screen

  i want to speak to mr tancred
explained cardona he just came in
a few minutes ago wearing a fuzzy
coat tell him a friends out here to see
him

  the waiter nodded he went into the
blue room

  two minutes passed then a head was
thrust from the doorway cardona
recognized the face it was that of
bowser riggins a man who had come
in with goldy tancred

  huh greeted bowser its you
eh o k
the shadow magazine



  he turned and waved to some one in
the room a moment later goldy tan-
cred appeared in person to display his
shining molars when he saw the detec-
tive

  wait inside for me bowser or-
dered tancred

  dressed in tuxedo the gold-toothed
man made an imposing appearance de-
spite the hardness of his heavy face he
joined cardona outside the screen and
walked a few paces along the side
passage then with a quizzical frown
he turned to the detective

  whatre you doing here joe he
growled no raid coming off is
there these fellows always have

things fixed-

  im not working on booze squads
returned cardona in a low steady tone
you know that goldy im here on
account of you-and if you dont know
it you ought to know it

  news to me joe

  yeah you were always supposed
to be a good listener goldy its funny
you havent heard whats being said
goldys puzzled look turned to one
of enlightenment the big fellow
chuckled and slapped the detective on
the shoulder

  listen joe he said becoming seri-
ous thats all hooey-that talk about
them being out to get me im not in
any racket never carried a gat in my
life take a look now do you think
id be a sap if i was in danger

  he spread the sides of his tuxedo
jacket offering the detective an oppor-
tunity to frisk him for a weapon

  cardona did not accept the invitation
instead he made another comment
youve got bowser riggins along
with you remarked the sleuth he
sticks pretty clr-e most of the time
doesnt he

  sure he does admitted goldy but
he doesnt pack a rod either ill bring
him out look him over hes a pal
joe not a bodyguard maybe he does

a strong-arm job for me once in a while
-but it never amounts to much

  cardona pondered there was both
truth and reason in what goldy tan-
cred had to say nevertheless the de-
tective could not forget the causes that
had prompted him to undertake this
mission

  goldy with a slow smile suddenly
seemed to divine the detectives
thoughts

  listen joe he said quietly i
know whats got into your head youve
been listening to some stool-pigeon
chatter thats it huh

  maybe replied the detective in a
noncommittal growl

  ill tell you what ails those guys
laughed goldy its the way you
handle them if theyve got nothing to
say you figure theyre laying down on
the job so theyre wise enough to slip
you phony dope that they know cant
be checked

  its happened before joe they
figure that just because i know how to
make tinhorn racketeers eat dirt that
some day a yellow dog is going-to try
to bump me so all they have to do to
earn their bird seed is come slinking in-
and say that theyve got wind of som
guy-they dont know who-thats out
to take a shot at goldy tancred

  thats straight enough agreed car-
dona calmly i know how you stand
goldy but sometimes when talk gets
going around a bit i get a hunch ive
got one now

  keep it joe smiled goldy maybe
its due funnier things than that have
happened but im giving you some-
thing else thats straight i cant think
of any crawler who would have nerve
enough to take a whack at me par-
ticularly up here joe this is a po-
litical outfit this mohawk bunch no-
bodys going to disturb them

  have it your own way goldy re-
marked cardona with a shrug of his


the shadow magazine

shoulders just the same im staying
around a while

  come on inside then suggested
goldy stroll in any time you want
sit down and join the feed i dont
think youll know many of the crowd

but youre welcome just the same-

  thanks goldy smiled cardona
ill probably be there later

  the detective strolled along the cor-
ridor after goldy tancred had gone
back into the blue room he walked
toward the elevators and stared suspi-
ciously into the vacant blackness of the
ballroom

  cardona noticed that men in tuxedos
were coming from an elevator and head-
ing toward the red room at the other
end of the corridor he caught a few
snatches of conversation and gained the
knowledge that a dinner was being held
there by a society of-electrical engineers

  moving back toward the blue room
cardona began to wonder whether or
not he had made a mistake in coming to
the olympia hotel

  goldy tancred had hit the nail
squarely when he had suggested that
cardona must have been listening to the
chatter of stool pigeons persistent ru-
mors from the underworld had it that
goldy tancred was going on the spot

  there was reason in such rumors
goldy tancred was a big shot de luxe
informants kept him posted regarding
the doings of racketeers he found
ways to make it difficult for those whose
activities bordered on crime

  to be successful a racketeer found it
wise to keep in the good graces of goldy
tancred time and again soft grafts
had been smashed because the perpetra-
tors had ignored the big shot hence
there were many who might like to see
goldy tancred out of the way

  goidy was too wise to be at odds with
the police he could not be branded as
a racketeer for there was no proof that
he engineered schemes of his own he

merely sat back and watched others
work here to-night he was mingling
with a group of quasi-politicians who
called themselves the mohawks that
was part of goldys game he dealt in
protection giving it or refusing it as
best suited his purposes

  had some one crossed goldy ytan-
cred were important figures of the
underworld anxious to launch a new
scheme of crime free from his clever
tribute-taking surveillance if such
were the case there was reason why
goldys life might now be threatened

  joe cardona gave this case grim con-
sideration as he turned back toward the
blue room the detective was not here
to protect goldy tancred he was here
to thwart crime that might b in the
making

  with a shrug of his shoulders car-
dona entered the blue room he
found a chair at a corner table along
with a group of lesser politicians these
men enjoying their first evening with
the mohawks were quiet in demeanor
they accepted the detective as another
of their ilk and made no effort to open
conversation

  thus joe cardona watched his
steady vigilant gaze never once lost
sight of goldy tancred and his com-
panion bowser riggins the detective
was ready for trouble when it should
break and as the minutes drifted by
joe cardona became more and more
convinced that his hunch was correct

  the detective sensed that violent
death would be attempted within the
walls of the olympia hotel on this very
night he waited patiently while the
mohawks chattered and burst forth in
boisterous song

  at last restless and uneasy cardona
pushed his chair from the table he
sidled along the edge of the room and
paused as he neared the door some-
thing told him that danger might lie
without he felt that the crucial mo-
ment was close at hand
the shadow magazine



  then while the merrymaking was
rising to a new height the unexpected
happened one instant joe cardona
was watching goldy tancred and bow-
ser riggins as the pair were laughing
at the capers of a stout bald-headed
politician the next moment the entire
scene was gone

  without a warning the room was
plunged in darkness every light not
only in the blue room but throughout
the entire hotel was blotted into black-
ness with that unfathomable gloom
shouts and laughter seemed to die away
a black hush lay over all

chapter ii

murder strikes

  while the mohawks had been en-
joying themselves so loudly in the blue
room a quiet dinner was in progress
at the other side of the olympia hotel
within the red room some thirty men
were listening to a presiding officer at
the head table

  this gentleman was richard reardon
a prominent member of the association
of electrical engineers the organiza-
tion which was assembled here to-night
heavy of build a trifle over average
height reardon was a man of im-
pressive appearance

  on this occasion he was introducing
a young man who sat beside him in
quiet convincing terms reardon was
telling the assemblage that in roland
furness the association possessed a
member whose ability would soon be
widely recognized

  while roland furness red-faced and
uncomfortable because of reardons
praise was glancing toward the table-
cloth the darkness came to the red
room as promptly as if some one
had pulled a hidden switch blackness re-
placed light the change caught rich-
ard reardon in the middle of a sen-
tence

after a momentary pause the presi-

dent resumed his discourse in a voice
that sounded strangely modulated in the
midst of that impenetrable darkness

  we shall wait he announced un-
til the light is restored then we shall
be ready to hear from our associate ro-
land furness

  a sharp exclamation came from the
man beside the president roland fur-
ness had risen to his feet in the dark-
ness something in the hushing power
of the new atmosphere had evidently
alarmed him

  he spoke excitedly-almost gasping
-amid the thickened gloom as he turned
in the direction where richard reardon
had been sitting

  something is wrong he said in a
low muffled tone something that i
never believed could happen-something
that may mean serious danger-

  only reardon caught the worried
words the president groped blindly
and found his companions arm he
could feel furness trembling reardon
too rose to his feet then as he heard
furness gasp again the president
stepped backward from the table

  a sudden gleam of light was sweeping
through the room the brilliant rays of
a powerful lantern were focused upon
the men at the head table the diners
could see reardon and furness both
raising their arms in surprise as they
were caught within the circle of that ter-
rific glare

  the light was coming from the door
of the room held by an unseen person
it was a veritable spotlight that had
picked out the two principal men of this
assemblage furness open-mouthed
was partly in front of reardons form

  the bark of a revolver sounded from
the darkness although its flash ap-
peared behind the light the shot had a
sound that was almost muffled the
firing was repeated-again-again-
again

  roland furness staggered he col-


the shadow magazine

lapsed upon the table his falling form
dearly revealed in the circle of illumina-
tion

  a second later richard reardon
dropped two men living but a few
moments ago were sprawled lifeless be-
fore the horrified witnesses

  the powerful glare went out stygian
darkness was all that remained

  not a man in the room possessed the
immediate resourcefulness to cope with
this unexpected situation tragedy had
happened before their startled eyes
tragedy that was hidden by an amazing
black-out

  appalling gloom the same black
hush lay within the blue room at the
other side of the hotel there joe car-
dona grim amid the darkness still stood
beside the door expecting to hear the
sound of shots before him

  but the man who expected did not
hear those muffled reports from the
other side of the hotel had not reached
his ears

  joe cardona waited a click sounded
from his left hand he had drawn his
flashlight and had pressed the button
the instrument however did not work

  cardona growled he could not un-
derstand this he jockeyed grimly with
the button while his right hand clutched
a revolver seconds were ticking into
minutes still the torch was useless the
detective cursed his negligence he hoped
only that he could fight without the aid
of light

  then came unexpected relief the
blue room was suddenly flooded with
brilliance the lights had come on
for a moment the detective saw a sea
of whitened faces then a buzz started
as the mohawks resumed their inter-
rupted noise-making

  cardona saw goldy tancred the
man was serious and worried in ex-
pression then slowly he showed his
teeth in a sickly but glittering grin
bowser riggins gaining courage from
his chief smiled feebly

  a false alarm

  that was cardonas momentary
thought then seeing that all was well
here the detective swung from the door
and entered the corridor there as in
the blue room light had been restored
no person was lurking in the corridor
but cardonas ears caught the sound of
wild terrified shouts

  responding the detective dashed
along the corridor to the other side f
the hotel he arrived at the open door
of the red room he dropped his
flashlight into his coat pocket and dis-
played his badge as he encountered a
group of frightened struggling men
who were pushing toward the corridor

  the sight of badge and revolver
stayed the near stampede men dropped
into their chairs they looked at car-
dona for help pointing fingers and ex-
cited words directed the sleuths atten-
tion to the sight that had caused this
commotion

  slumped across the head table were
the bodies of richard reardon and ro-
land furness cardona needed no testi-
mony to tell him what had happened
his practiced eye knew that the middle-
aged association president and the young
electrical engineer had been slain in cold
blood

  cardona calmly closed the door of
the room and locked it he ordered one
man to telephone for assistance he mo-
tioned all who were standing to chairs
grim-faced he took command then
after studying the persons present he
walked up beside the bodies

   it was not long before police arrived
cardona unlocked he door to admit the
officers

   the detective had done the best thing
possible under the circumstances com-
ing through the corridor he had seen no
one who might have figured in this dou-
ble murder he felt sure that the killer
had probably escaped nevertheless it
had been essential to hold all who were
the shadow magazine



present cardona had done this effec-
tively

  with policemen to do his bidding
cardona began a quiz

  he learned immediately that the shots
had been fired from the door that the
victims had been spotted by a powerful
light no one present-and most were
close friends of reardon and furness-
could suggest a motive for the killings

  important details in the handling of
this case required time inspector tim-
othy klein arrived more men came on
the job at last with testimony taken
and witness examined joe cardona
found himself alone in an emptied room
he went out into the corridor and
walked slowly to the other side of the
hotel he looked into the blue room

  the mohawk meeting was still on
politicians highly convivial were still
at their merrymaking they had not
heard the news of murder cardona
saw goldy tancred and bowser rig-
gins enjoying themselves at the head
yle

  the detective went back toward the
red room he met inspector klein
his superior noted the serious ex-
pression upon cardonas face

  what is it joe inquired klein

  theres a meeting in the blue
room responded the detective slowly
thats on the other side of the hotel
the mohawk club

  what about it

  it used to be held in the red room

  you think that has something to do
with this-

  cardona nodded

  yes he said thoughtfully it prob-
ably has a lot to do with it a gang
killing inspector--one that didnt click

  the pair started toward the lower
lobby cardona paused a moment at the
head of the stairs he wanted to see if
there was any trace of a man who had
come in this direction

  he drew his flashlight from his

pocket remembered suddenly that it was
out of order then stopped and uttered a
puzzled exclamation

  the flashlight was turned on it had
been gleaming in cardonas pocket the
switch was just as it had been pressed
the instrument that had failed to func-
tion in a time of need was now casting
rays of useless illumination

  puzzled the detective turned the
flashlight off and on he repeated the
operation several times the torch
worked perfectly

  with a grunt cardona extinguished
the flashlight and thrust it back into his
pocket even though it appeared to be
in perfect order he would get a new
one no use to rely upon a flashlight
that had failed once at a crucial mo-
ment

  there was important work to do
now cardona wanted to find out who
had entered the red room and left-
probably scurrying down the stairs and
out to the street amid the darkness he
wanted to learn what had caused the
lights of the hotel to-fail

  these proved insurmountable ques-
tions when cardonas investigation
was finished he had gained nothing he
thought he knew the motive he under-
stood the style of killing those were
important matters but the clew that
he wanted-the cause of the extin-
guished lights-was something that he
did not manage to gain

  cardona when he reached headquar-
ters was still disturbed because he had
not obtained a shred of evidence that
involved the mysterious darkness he
sat at his desk and scratched his chin
he felt something in his pocket thump
against the arm of his chair

  angrily cardona pulled out the
faulty flashlight and tossed it into a
wastebasket he got up from his chair
and sauntered out to report to inspector
klein he did not realize the im-
portance of the action which he had just
performed


the shadow magazine

  unwittingly detective joe cardona
had thrown away the only clew that he
possessed that discarded flashlight
was the one link that might have led
him to the solution of the black hush
that had fallen over the olympia hotel
to-night

chapter iii

the shadow begins

  headlines told of the double killing
at the olympia hotel new yorkers
read of ganglands outrage mingled
with bacon and eggs came the cry of
murder as breakfasters perused their
newspapers

  such events had occurred before the
slaughter of innocent victims was no
novel feature in the ceaseless surge of
underworld warfare playing children
massacred by machine-gun bullets had
raised a storm of public rage which had
finally died slain members of an en-
gineering association were another story
one that would be forgotten more
quickly

  richard reardon and roland fur-
ness were unfortunate victims every
one granted that fact and agreed that
the perpetrators of the outrage should
be brought to justice but in back of
all the disapproval was the established
idea that the men had died through a
mistake

  detective joe cardona had expressed
that belief and it had been accepted
every journal in manhattan was in ac-
cord the case was too obvious for
doubt even the man who had been
missed was known

  unknown mobsmen out to get goldy
tancred had made a blunder some-
how they had extinguished the lights
in the olympia hotel under cover of
darkness they had entered the red
room where they had believed the meet-
ing of the mohawks was being held

  richard reardon heavy and con-
spicuous had been mistaken for goldy

tancred well-directed bullets had
marked reardons aim roland fur-
ness also in the danger zone had been
put on the spot as well it was possible
that he had been taken for bowser rig-
gins

  newspaper columns were filled with
hectic details which included garbled
statements of the witnesses members
of the association of electrical en-
gineers when interviewed had given
varied stories such statements re-
ceived no more than passing mention

  one man said that the shots had pre-
ceded the light another told the oppo-
site one declared that he had seen the
light move away another that it had
been extinguished before it moved one
more declared that the killer had used
an acetylene lantern instead of an elec-
tric flashlight

  but the sum and substance of all the
reports was that goldy tancred had
been slated for the spot a big shot
liked by politicians but unpopular
among certain gang leaders had escaped
the doom that was intended for him

  goldy himself knew nothing he
was staying close to his palatial apart-
ment high up in the hotel marathon
his famous astrakhan coat no longer
would be seen at brindles restaurant
goldy tancred-so reporters affirmed-
would prefer to send out for sandwiches
in the future

  close-mouthed except for his smile
goldy had told reporters and police that
he knew of no one who was out to get
him in fact the big-timer was in-
sisting that the death bullets had not
been intended for him at all news
writers however knew better than that
and they passed their inside knowledge
along to the public

  detective joe cardona read the
morning newspapers with a real relish
his presence at the olympia hotel was
universally commended he had used
good sense in watching goldy tancred
the shadow magazine



it was not his fault that the killers had
blundered

  commissioner ralph weston over-
lord of new york police had voiced his
approval of cardonas tactics he sup-
ported the detectives findings and he
had promptly deputed cardona to handle
the case

  among the newspaper men who were
active on the story
was clyde burke a
reporter for the new
york classic a vet-
eran news gatherer

clyde believed that
cardona was right

secretly however he
wondered what the
outcome of this af-
fair might be for
clyde knew from
experience that
there was some one
who could deal with
ganglands slayers
even when the most
ardent police meas-
ures failed

  clyde burke was
thinking of the
shadow like other
newspapermen f a -
miliar with the tur-
moil of the under-
world clyde had
heard the strange
reports of a mysteri-
ous being who had
long fought crime
upon an equal basis

a master of the
night - a strange
weird personage whose eyes saw every-
where and whose unseen hand struck
from the dark-the shadow had be-
come recognized as the hidden threat
who carried doom into the strongholds
of evil

  clyde burke however knew from ex-
perience what others had gleaned from

rumor he like others had heard it
said that the shadow employed opera-
tives who aided him in his warfare
against master minds of crime well
did clyde burke know the truth of this
supposition for clyde burke himself
was a secret agent of the shadow

  in a room at the metrolite hotel an-
other young man was pondering upon
the same matters
that concerned clyde
burke a resident
guest of the hotel
harry vincent was
scanning the days
headlines like clyde
burke harry be-
lieved that joe car-
dona had the correct
information never-
theless harry was
wondering what
would follow he
too was an agent of
the shadow

  in an office of the
huge badger build-
ing a chubby-faced
man also studied the
morning newspapers
with careful shears
he clipped the col-
umns that carried
the story of the dou-
ble slaying at the
olympia hotel by
profession this plac-
id individual was an
investment broker
his name was rut-
ledge mann and his
many acquaintances
knew him merely as a specialist on
financial advice

  but mann who held no opinion re-
garding cardonas theory was also won-
dering about the future like clyde
burke and harry vincent rutledge
mann served the shadow where the
others were active and frequently in

  here is goldy tancred big-
time gambler and racketeer whose
racket is the rackets clear of
the police because he keeps his
own hands out of scandal he is in
fact the biggest crook of them all
and one whom all other crooks
envy

  was the sinister menace of the
black hush intended for him


the shadow magazine

the field mann acted as a contact agent
he supplied information and data that
might be required these clippings that
he was gathering to-day were being pre-
pared for delivery to the shadow

  his compilation completed rutledge
mann put all his clippings in an en-
velope he left his office took a taxi to
twenty-third street and entered a
dingy building on an upstairs floor
he stopped at the door of a deserted of-
fice which bore the name jonas on its
cobwebbed pane he dropped the en-
velope in the mail slit

  manns work was done until later or-
ders might be received

  the mail slit was the delivery box
that enabled mann to reach the
shadow complete reports on the
olympia outrage were now posted to
the master mind whatever the sequel
might be rutledge mann would be
ready to obey instructions

  clyde burkes reportorial work-
harry vincents perusal of the news-
papers-rutledge manns clipping
service-all these were productive of an
important aftermath a strange un-
seen event occurred somewhere in new
york-and its beginning was a click
that sounded in a secret room

  intense blackness was suddenly
ended by a bluish light that appeared
in the comer -of a black-walled apart-
ment an uncanny glow was focused
upon the polished surface of a table
directly beneath the shaded circle of a
blue-bulbed light

  in only one place could this phenom-
enon occur that spot was the shad-
ows sanctum away from all the
world the very location of his secret
room unknown the shadow master of
darkness planned his warfare against
the hosts of evil

  two hands appeared beneath the
bluish glow they were long hands
with tapering fingers that combined
smoothness with strength there was

no mistaking the hands of the shadow
for upon a finger of the left hand rested
the identifying token of the master

  this was a gleaming gem that shone
math a changing hue that symbolized
mystery the shadows girasol-a fire
opal unmatched in all the world-glist-
ened like a sparkling eye in ever-chang-
ing hues

  from azure the girasol took on the
shades of a rich purple its glowing
depths became a brilliant crimson only
to change to a deep maroon that gave
the stone an appearance of unlimited
depths all the while the illusion of
sparks persisted flashes of flame
seemed to leap upward toward the light

  the white hands produced an en-
velope and removed its contents rut-
ledge manns clippings lay in view the
right hand brought forward a pen and
a sheet of blank paper while hidden
eyes studied the reports the hand be-
gan to write

  brief pointed facts appeared like
thoughts as the hand rested eyes
from the dark visualized those state-
ments bluish ink dried then disap-
peared the memory of the vanished
words remained locked in the brain

  could joe cardona have seen those
inscriptions he would have been amazed
for the shadow step by step was shat-
tering the detectives theory he was
tracing a very definite connection be-
tween the big shot and the murders in
the red room

  where cardona had pictured goldy
as a man who had escaped a menace
the shadow saw the big shot as one
who had known a designed murder
goldy tancred-threatened-was the
last person whom the police could sus-
pect of complicity but the shadow
deducted otherwise

  the change of the mohawks meeting
from red room to blue room-the
holding of the affair on the same night
as the meeting of the electrical en-
gineers-these had been accepted as
the shadow magazine



mere coincidence to the shadow
however such an obvious conclusion
was not to be accepted

  cold-blooded mobsmen who attacked
beneath a barrage of blackness were not
the ones to make so clumsy an error
the shadow versed in knowledge of
underworld tactics was quick to reject
cardonas theory

  richard reardon and roland fur-
ness  one-perhaps both-had been
marked for death

 why

  they were not men of crime yet the
explanation must exist from a study
of the past and an observation of the
future the reason could be discovered

  crime was impending-crime that
bore the mark of genius the secret of
mighty schemes was unrevealed yet
there were ways to reach it where the
police were content to look for un-
known murderers the shadow in-
tended to follow other courses

  the shadow wrote

goldy tancred

  a soft laugh came through the gloom
of the room its whispered tones awoke
pulsating echoes the hand inscribed
terse comments beneath the name that
it had written goldy tancred must be
watched there was a way to do it
the shadow was making his plans

  two other names appeared upon the
paper side by side the shadow con-
sidered them

richard reardon-roland furness

  again the hand began its comments
the careers of these men must be
traced somewhere in the events of
their lives might lie an item of evidence

  ear phones slid across the table as
the hands reached beyond to obtain
them the shadow spoke into a mouth-
piece his low tones were passing over
a private wire to a listener as secretive
as himself

  burbank speaking

  the quiet voice over the wire was that
of the shadows hidden contact man
always ready for the shadows bid-
ding burbank dwelt in obscurity and
kept up a telephonic communication with
the shadows agents words that came
to burbank were relayed back and forth
between the shadow and his men

  clyde burke on duty responded
the shadow in an even monotone-
commence observation on the activ-
ities of goldy tancred-

  the voice continued burbank lis-
tened while the shadow spoke his
hand was writing every word that he
gave to burbank was inscribed in blue
upon a blank sheet of paper the state-
ments however were in code

  the shadow concluded his orders
as he told burbank to stand by he
folded the paper before the writing had
reached the vanishing stage and placed
it in an envelope this was to go to
rutledge mann the writing would not
disappear until after the investment
broker had learned its import 
harry vincent on duty the
shadow went on to cooperate with
rutledge mann in uncovering facts re-
garding richard reardon and roland

furness-

  the voice continued the hand wrote
and closed its message the ear phones
slid across the table instructions to
burbank were ended the orders to
rutledge mann sealed in separate en-
velopes were carried away by the
shadows hands

  the light clicked out invisible
within the walls of his windowless
sanctum the shadow laughed again
weird echoes of a mocking cry rever-
berated from the hollow spaces the
shadows work had begun

  during the future his eyes would
watch the activities of goldy tancred
the man who had escaped meanwhile
delving into the past his investigating
forces would discover facts regarding


the shadow magazine

richard reardon and roland furness
the men who had encountered death

  somewhere between the affairs of
the big shot and the dead engineers lay
crime of an insidious nature goldy
tancred feigning a connection with
small-fry politicians was seeking to
cover up the game

   clearly the shadow saw that goldys
pretensions were a bluif that he was
using the unsuspecting mohawks as an
alibi just as plainly the shadow knew
that there had been a definite purpose
in the killings of reardon and furness

  the echoes of the shadows laugh
persisted at last like dying whispers
from invisible ghosts they faded into
nothingness only impenetrable dark-
ness remained within the sanctum

  strange darkness like a shroud it
had veiled the presence of the master
mind from that darkness the shadow
had gone into light he would find
darkness again-for the shadow struck
best from stygian gloom

   this time however a curious analogy
remained out of darkness had the
shadow gone into darkness he must
come to deal with the hidden foe for
the shadow now was dealing with
strange fighters who also had used
blackness to mask their crimes

  it was darkness that the shadow
sought it was darkness that he would
find that strange black hush that had
fallen over the olympia hotel would
spread its blanketing depths again

   its sinister folds would envelop the
shadow along with fiends of crime the
shadow had begun his campaign against
the menace of the black hush

chapter iv

from the tower

   in contrast to the impenetrable gloom
that always pervaded the shadows
sanctum the light of day still shone
above the island of manhattan it was
waning afternoon and the city streets

were darkening but the sun gave spar-
kling brilliance to the offices of great
skyscrapers

  glinting rays of light were reflected
by the polished walls of futuristic build-
ings most conspicuous of these was
the new judruth tower which lifted its
jutting shaft ninety-five stories toward
the sky a pinnacle that formed a
tribute to modern engineering this
structure added a new spectacle to man-
hattans sky line
the highest office floor was the
ninety-third there in a private office
a bespectacled stout man was studying
the afternoon edition of a new york
daily behind his flat-topped mahogany
desk he was reading rewritten accounts
of the tragedy at the olympia hotel

  a knock at the door the stout man
laid the paper aside ordered the per-
son to come in a stenographer entered
the man at the desk peered toward her
through his gold-rimmed glasses

  it is after five oclock mr fawcett
said the girl the office force has left
i am going now unless you have some
additional letters that must be mailed
quite all right to leave responded
fawcett i intend to wait for hobbs
he couldnt get back to town in time
for the sales conference this noon
the stenographer nodded and left
the stout man resumed his reading for
a short while then dropped the paper
and arose from the desk he strolled to
the window and looked down toward the
streets of the city that were spread out
below him

  then with a smile upon his lips faw-
cett went from his corner office he
entered another room and closed the
door behind him the glass panel of his
private office bore the name

hector fawcett
president

  continuing fawcett reached another
door and stepped through it to an ante-
room where a row of elevator doors
the shadow magazine



 greeted his eye the door behind him
 -bore another legend

climax corporation
electro-therapeutical
equipment

   the elevator doors were heavy-metal
 barriers that completely closed this ante-
 room from the outside world hector
 fawcett smiled in satisfaction his eye
 ran along the doors all but one were
 stopping points at the ninety-third floor
 the sole exception was a special shaft
 which ran exclusively to the observa-
 tion floors above

   sure that no one was loitering in the
 anteroom fawcett returned to his of-
 fices leaving the door unlocked behind
 him this would be an invitation to the
 expected visitor in the meantime the
 president of the climax corporation be-
 gan a short tour through his suite of
 offices

   the entire space of the ninety-third
 floor was occupied by the one enterprise 
 fawcett strolled from office to office
 each corner of the floor had a private
 office like the one which the president
 occupied but with the exception of
 fawcetts own room these were devoid
 of desks and chairs instead they
 served as display rooms for electro-
 therapeutical equipment and many
 kindred devices

   sun-ray machines health devices
 other items designed for treatment of
 illness-these made up a galaxy of shin-
 ing apparatus hector fawcetts busi-
 ness was in keeping with the times peo-
 ple were ready to purchase mechanical
 inventions of this type the business
 was one that afforded tremendous
 profit

   to-day fawcett had been in confer-
 ence with his sales force standing in
 one of the display rooms he recalled the
 pep talk that he had given them the
 climax corporation could fill orders as
 fast as they came in it was up to

the salesmen to produce electro-
therapy was on the rise

  the proof fawcett himself had
given up another profitable business to
develop this one with faith in the fu-
ture he had leased this entire floor of
the new judruth tower the rental
like the altitude was high fawcett
wanted results and he intended to get
them

  the president recalled that he had
cited the case of hobbs the other
salemen had never seen this member of
the force the reason hobbs was al-
ways on the go in and out of new
york-everywhere-the man was a live
wire

  some day fawcett had promised
hobbs would tell the other salesmen
how he managed to produce but for
the present hobbs was too busy taking
orders from eager customers to make
a sales talk

  still smiling in recollection hector
fawcett approached an inner office this
loom its door locked served as a storage
place for new items of equipment faw-
cett himself had the only key he
opened the door turned on the light
and looked over the assemblage of elec-
tricaj apparatus

  most of the machines were duplicates
of items on display in the corner offices
there was one noteworthy exception
this was an oddly shaped device
mounted on rubber wheels it consisted
of a cylindrical box with a curved door
in the front above it mounted on a
thick post was a burnished projector
that resembled a searchlight

  there was a control switch at the
side there were also focusing levers
and pivoting arrangements these
were oddly designed but they were not
the chief item of peculiarity that lay
in the glazed front of the searchlight
itself

  the face of the projector was solid
black

  an amazing paradox-a device that


the shadow magazine

seemed designed for the issuance of
light--yet it was coated with a surface
which light could not penetrate

  hector fawcetts smile became a
laugh the corporation president turned
on his heel and left the storeroom he
closed and locked the door behind him
he went back into his own office and
picked up the telephone from the desk
in a methodical voice he gave a number
he recognized the tone that responded

  hello greeted fawcett yes
   waiting now    yes
ive been reading the newspapers right
here    exactly as we expected
   no reason for delay now

  fawcett was moving toward the win-
dow of the office standing there he still
talked in the telephone while he stared
outward and downward

  yes he continued ive made the
observations its up to hobbs now
 no  no  a
test is unnecessary    just the
sighting at the correct hour   
ill call you later

  hector fawcett hung up the re-
ceiver he stood by the window and
studied the vista of the city below aft-
ernoon was waning even at this height
where the final rays of the setting sun
lingered

  pygmy automobiles were passing
along the ribbonlike streets in the
chasms between the buildings of man-
hattan tiny lights were twinkling from
myriad windows

  hector fawcett chuckled

  this altitude gave the bespectacled
man a sense of vast superiority the
feeling would have been justified from
even a commercial standpoint the
thought of salesmen who had issued
forth from here to find limitless sources
of revenue among the thousands of po-
tential customers in those buildings

  but fawcetts ideas were of a vaster
scheme commercial enterprise meant
nothing to this watcher to him those

buildings were masses of ore among
which were veins of profitable material

  within a huge radius from the jud-
ruth tower that source of wealth was
workable from this office-from the
other corner rooms-hector fawcett
could point his finger at the spots he
wanted then when the proper time ar-
rived he could arrange the action that
would bring prompt results

  a promoter of experience hector
fawcett was now in back of a scheme
that could mean millions completed
plans were ready the first test had
been made and with it the way had
been paved toward success

  crime what of it

  murder it had proven necessary

  such considerations did not restrain
this man his longing for gain sur-
passed all else behind an exterior that
denoted a business man of integrity the
real hector fawcett was an individual
without conscience

  there was reason for his smile in
all his former schemes of promotion
fawcett had carefully masked all un-
scrupulous activities he knew how to
obtain the prestige that went with suc-
cessful business president of the cli-
max corporation his affairs would pass
the closest scrutiny

  like goldy tancred hector fawcett
was a man who had avoided crime but
fawcett had not even allowed himself
to deal with shady enterprises like
goldy fawcett had watched his actions
purely because he knew the risk in-
volved

  there were easier ways to make
money but when crime could be perpe-
trated with the dangers minimized that
altered the aspect it wras the attain-
ment of such a condition that had turned
hector fawcett to his present schemes

  high above the world safe from ob-
servation he felt positive that his ac-
tions were also free from possible detec-
tion sleuths could do their utmost
they would never reach this stronghold
the shadow magazine



  many opportunities had come to hec-
tor fawcett this was the time that
he had engaged in the promotion of a
new and alluring enterprise-that of
crime here was crime that would be
fool-proof crime that had stood the
test crime that would increase in power
with each succeeding effort

  the sky was darkening now in the
gloom of his office hector fawcett
turned away from the window where
manhattan lay helpless before his eyes

  he had heard the sound of an open-
ing door his visitor had arrived turn-
ing on the light fawcett took his seat
behind the desk just as another man
entered the room

  hector fawcett smiled in greeting
this was the person he had expected
known to the office as hobbs accepted
by others as a traveling salesman who
spent most of the time on the road this
visitor was actually hector fawcetts
associate in stupendous crime

chapter v

burke reports

  goldy tancred was seated in the
living room of his luxurious suite at the
hotel marathon bowser riggins the
man whom he called a pal and others
termed his bodyguard was lolling in a
corner by the window

  attired in a dressing gown of gor-
geous colors goldy tancred appeared
quite unconcerned in these surroundings
he did not have the look of a hunted
man nevertheless there was signifi-
cance in the fact that he was not abroad
to-night normally this big shot did
not have the stay-at-home habit

  a heavily built man entered the room
and turned a sour motionless face in
goldys direction although dressed in
a business suit this fellow had the man-
ner of a servant who had come to make
an announcement

  what is it curry questioned
goldy

 shad-a

  reporter outside to see you an-
swered curry guy named burke
comes from the classic wants an in-
terview

  bowser riggins offered an objection
before the big shot could make reply

  say-the bodyguards expression
was a growl-aint there no end to
those guys theres been half a dozen

up to see you goldy-

  the big shot waved his hand for si-
lence

  show him in curry he ordered
ill talk to him i knew burke

  tiie big shot held out his hand when
clyde burke entered although he
made no effort to rise goldys clasp was
cordial as he received the reporters
handshake burke took a chair that
goldy pointed out to him and drew the
seat alongside that of goldys

  listen goldy burke was serious
as he took up the conversation you
know what im after a story the 
boys are all wise whats the use of
kidding them

 wise to what queried goldy
suavely

  wise that somebodys out to get
you returned clyde why dont you
give us something to work on if you
know whos on your trail it wont hurt
to spill the news

  no goldys question came with
a smile that showed his shining dental
equipment say burke youre no nit-
wit like most of these news hounds
you dont think im a squawker do
you if i was-goldy indulged in a
contemptuous leer-id have been
pushing up posies long ago squawkers
dont go thats all

  murder has been committed said
the reporter gravely if you have any
way of rectifying it-of bringing justice
against the killers-you should take the
opportunity

  goldy tancred leaned back in his
chair and loosed a long horselaugh he


the shadow magazine

looked toward bowser riggins then
pointed at clyde bitrke

  listen to that bowser chuckled
the big shot this column-filler talks
like joe cardona remember the line
he passed out when he dropped in here
this morning

  bowser grinned and nodded

  say-goldy was speaking to burke
now-if i couldnt tell cardona any-
thing you dont think id have any dope
for you do you 

  no admitted burke but when

cardona talked to you-

  i told him the truth interposed
goldy i told him that i didnt know
of any rat that had nerve enough to try
to get me i admitted there were a lot
of boobs who might have it in for me
because i had queered their cheap rack-
ets for them but i didnt need to name
them

  why not

  because cardona already had the
list what do you think he pays a lot
of stool pigeons for-just to hear them
tell funny stories listen news hound
if any guy was after me last night
cardona has just as good a chance of
guessing who he was as i have

  theres the whole lay its easier
for cardona to locate the bird he wants
im not worried im not going around
to look for trouble its a police job
let him do it its his business

  goldy smiled more pleasantly when he
saw clyde burke nod in agreement to
his statement

  murder said the big shot becom-
ing somewhat serious thats what is
was burke-cold murder cardona is
a smart detective as a matter of fact
hes beginning to convince me that they
were really after me-but at the same
time im not sure enough to say so

  now suppose that a pot shot had
been taken at me suppose that bowser
here had taken a dose of lead trying
to protect me from some sap who had
more bullets than brains well it would

be different then burke id be forced
to admitthat they were on my trail

  but as it is ive got no proof if
i come out and try to place the marker
on some bozo ive got to make every
one that i think is sore at me what
would that mean ill tell you-it
would give me a dozen enemies-maybe
two dozen

  instead of a flock of rats id have
a troop of foxes on my list you know
how those small-fry mobsters work
they hide out and run away until they
think theyre in for something then
they get nasty so im just sitting back
and saying nothing thats all no
names not one

  well volunteered burke if car-
dona is satisfied-

  satisfied came goldys interrupt-
ing quiz say boy he saw the light
mighty quick you want to know why
ill tell you-provided that you dont
use it in your paper

  go ahead said burke

  cardona explained goldy figures
that the birds who bumped these elec-
trical engineers wont be satisfied until
they take another crack at me he
believes me when i tell him i dont
know who the killers are

  so hes laying quiet like i am why
should he stir up a lot of other rats-
or force me to do it theres a bunch
might take the trouble to come after
me if they got worried then cardona
would be stuck he wants the guys who
killed the engineers to show themselves
again

  ill tell you what ive done for car-
dona im laying low playing possum
acting almost like im scared thats a
good come-on isnt it of course im
playing safe even though this talk of
danger may be hokum but if these
tough bimboes want to waltz into trou-
ble of their own making ill be satisfied
so will cardona

  goldy tancred grinned and clasped
one hand with the other to demonstrate
the shadow magazine



an illustrative shake it was an effort
to explain the entente cordiale that ex-
isted between goldy and joe cardona

  clyde burke smiled

  thanks goldy he said youve
explained what was puzzling me
theres no story in it-but it may mean
that something will break a lot quicker

  despite his expression of new un-
derstanding clyde burke had actually
learned nothing which he did not know
before this unofficial arrangement be-
tween cardona and goldy tancred was
a logical procedure in fact it was
possible that the detective and the
smooth racketeer handler might have
checked up the names of certain gang-
sters

  clydes conversation had been in-
tended as a stall he wanted to stay
in goldys suite as long as possible that
was not part of his work for the classic
it was a duty that had been ordered by
the shadow

  while clyde was thinking of some
way to prolong the visit the telephone
rang on a table at goldy tancreds side
the big shot lifted the receiver clyde
caught a gleam of the gold teeth as
goldy talked across the wire

  hello    yes    goldy
seemed intensely interested yeah
 all right thats settled then
   hobbs will he there good
   good  

  intense interest had entered goldys
eyes now upon sudden thought the
big shot had apparently remembered that
a visitor was listening to his talk per-
haps it was the fact that he had men-
tioned the name of hobbs whatever
the cause of goldys change might have
been the result was immediate

  thats all right continued goldy
in a noncommittal tone glad you
called sorry i cant be at the party
   no im feeling pretty good
but im sticking around the apartment
for the time being    sure-ill

tell him when i see him    yeah
ill call you some day soon  

  goldy looked toward bowser riggins
as he lowered the receiver

  just been finding out im nothing but
a big playboy he remarked thats
about the tenth guy that has called me
up to go on a night-club party bunch
of chorus girls and other molls they
can leave me out of the night life for a
while

  the pretense was well done but
clyde burke sensed that goldy tancred
had sought to cover up a message of
real importance the reporter remem-
bered that name that goldy had men-
tioned-hobbs

  rising from his chair clyde burke
cast a glance about the room he noted
the elegant furnishings and his eye fell
upon a corner by the window a book-
case set at right angles to the win-
dow jutted out until it reached a hang-
ing curtain that draped to the window
ledge beyond the window clyde espied
the brass railing of a balcony

  so long goldy said the reporter
maybe ill drop in again

  wait a moment suggested the big
shot bowser will ride down with
you burke hes going out

  the bodyguard joined the reporter
they descended to the hotel lobby and
left by the same door there their
paths separated

  ordinarily clyde burke would have
gone directly to a telephone to communi-
cate with burbank the proximity of
bowser riggins restrained him on this
occasion

  clyde covered several blocks before
he dropped into a drug store and entered
a phone booth he obtained his number
quickly and talked with burbank in
short low sentences clyde stated that
goldy tancred had received a suspicious
call which involved the name of hobbs
he added the fact that he had noted con-
cerning the proximity of a bookcase to a
balconied window


the shadow magazine

  when clyde burke left the store he
called a taxi and directed the driver to
take him to the classic office the re-
porters only regret was that he had lost
fifteen minutes between the time of his
departure from goldys apartment and
his arrival at the telephone booth on
the contrary he felt sure that he had
escaped all observation

  in that thought the reporter was
wrong from the time that he had left
the hotel marathon a skulking figure
had followed him along the opposite side
of the street that same follower had
waited outside the drug store and had
heard clyde order the taxi man to take
him to the classic

  now a fox-faced dark-sweatered
gangster came into view and scurried
away along a side street the appear-
ance of bowser riggins with clyde
burke at the door of the hotel had been
this skulkers tip to take up the trail

  such was goldy tancreds game se-
cretly the overlord of racketeers was
in league with forces of the underworld
he had forces at his disposal but he
kept them hidden

  a big shot de luxe goldy tancred
like hector fawcett was a power in the
menace that was now impending the
black hush that had preceded murder
at the olympia hotel had been no mys-
tery to goldy tancred

  clyde burke agent of the shadow
had gained a partial inkling of that fact
soon the shadow himself would visit
the abode of goldy tancred

chapter vi

in goldys apartment

  hardly had clyde burke left goldy
tancreds apartment before curry en-
tered to speak to his master the
servants expression was quiet his tone
was confidential he was announcing
another visitor

  the man behind the guns-ping slat-
terly ping is goldy tancreds right-hand
man his active power while goldy
keeps hands off ping steps in and does
the dirty work thus maintaining the
power of his lord

  a short squat hard-faced man was
ushered into the room with the frame
of an orang-utan a visage like a
chunk of hewn rock and hands that
looked like mallets ping slatterly
looked like what he was-the toughest
gang leader in the underworld

  ping slatterlys huge chest swelled
the evil-faced gang leader leered he
sauntered toward the door with goldy
tancred following and turned to deliver
his parting expression of assurance

eye the rest is easy each guy has his
place teamwork fast pick-up and

  soft nothin to it wait and see

  curry appeared at goldy tancreds
call the servant went with ping slat-
terly down a flight of stairs he was
taking the gang leader to a service ele-
vator on a lower floor a dumb op-
erator an exit at the rear of the hotel
-that was the course which ping slat-
terly took when he visited the big shot

  back in his living room goldy tan-
cred strolled about smoking a cigarette
his teeth gleamed in occasional smiles
at last with a bored expression the big
shot sauntered from the room

  minutes drifted by not a sound
came to this apartment high up above
the street then so slowly that its mo-
tion was almost unnoticeable a window

sash began to rise through the open-
ing came a long black silhouette that
projected itself across the floor

  something blotted out the reflecting
surface of the raised windowpane the
sash moved downward the silhouette
advanced across the floor seemingly
from outer darkness a tall figure
materialized it developed into the
shape of a being clad entirely in black

  with cape reaching from his shoul-
ders with hands incased in thin black
gloves his features obscured by the
turned-down brim of a slouch hat the
shadow stood within the confines of
goldy tancreds living room

  a soft whispered laugh came from
invisible lips the black-hatted head
tilted upward a pair of burning eyes
studied the scene those glowing op-
tics turned in the direction of the book-
case close beside the window

  the position of the heavy article of
furniture answered clyde burkes de-
scription to burbank the shadow
stooped a small object showed in his
hands

  with calm precision the strange vis-
itant moved the bookcase slightly away
from the wall and attached a small in-
strument the bookcase moved back
the shadows hands urged a thin wire
in behind the curtain they continued
to draw the connection toward the win-
dow

  suddenly the worker stopped step-
ping half behind the curtain he became
entirely motionless not even the slight-
est rustling of the hanging betrayed his
presence the long silhouette still
stretched its black shape across the floor
but it did not waver

  curry had entered the room the
servant was closing the place for the
night he walked directly to the win-
dow passed within inches of the shad-
ows hidden form and tried the sash to
find it locked wheeling curry went
back toward the outer door and extin-
guished the light


the shadow magazine

  departing footsteps faded through the
hallway beyond the room the shad-
ows laugh came in a sinister whisper
by absolute stillness this weird in-
vestigator had completely avoided dis-
covery that was the shadows pur-
pose on this night

  the window sash moved upward the
shadow reached the balcony invisible
he lowered the sash so subtly that it
seemed to creep downward of its own
accord inch by inch a steel instrument
entered between the sections of the sash
an unseen hand relocked the window
from the outside so perfectly that no
trace of the deed remained

  the free end of the wire dropped from
the balcony and hung down the dark-
ened wall of the hotel the shadows
phantom figure moved to the end rail
then stretched itself upward and out-
ward long strong fingers caught the
projecting cornice of a window above
climbing like a human fly the shadow
reached his goal and entered an apart-
ment

  this place was occupied but no one
was awake the shadows cloak
swished slightly as its wearer made his
way to an outer door silence lingered
after the shadow had departed

  ten minutes afterward a window
opened in an apartment a few floors be-
low goldy tancreds domicile an in-
visible hand stretched out into the night
and caught the end of the slender hang-
ing wire a tiny flashlight threw a
dollar-sized disk of light upon the wall
of the apartment where the shadow
now was a gloved hand drew the end
of the wire to the bell box of a tele-
phone that was set against the wall

  there the shadow attacked another
mechanism the operation here re-
quired a multitude of details when it
was completed the shadow stepped
back and viewed the completed job with
the light of his tiny torch

  this was a private telephone and the

owner of the apartment was away up-
stairs in goldy tancreds living room
the shadow had attacked one end of a
dictograph connection here he had
hooked the line with the telephone

  through a perfected mechanism of
his own invention the shadow now had
the communication that he desired it
merely remained for burbank to call up
this apartment the ringing of the bell
would do the rest the call would ap-
parently be completed actually a con-
nection would be formed with the dicto-
graph line this meant that burbank
could listen in at will to whatever was
said in goldy tancreds place

  by hanging up his own receiver bur-
bank would complete the supposed call
thus the shadows hidden agent could
follow everything at a distance when-
ever the occasion might require there
would be some long calls over this wire
during the next few days

  the flashlight went out the shadow
swished through darkness the closed
apartment was once more empty the
shadows work was done

  impending crime could the shadow
learn its secret would his efforts
frustrate the schemes of evildoers 

  to-night clyde burke had gained an
inkling the shadow although too late
to witness ping slatterlys visit had ac-
complished something that would re-
veal to him all telephone calls and con-
versations in which goldy tancred
might be concerned

  well had the shadow planned his
eyes had seen now his ears would hear
important contact formed the shadow
held a great advantage

  only one factor served to spoil the
shadows measures to-night goldy
tancred had completed plans so effec-
tively that the big shot had decided to
abandon all communication for the
present

  unwittingly goldy had acted with
great wisdom the black hush was due
to fall again-in a place other than the
the shadow magazine



olympia hotel where it came crime
would follow until then goldy was
preserving silence

  the ingenuity of the shadow had al-
ready been counteracted by the man who
did not even suspect its presence

chapter vii

the shadow moves

  burbank speaking

  this was the statement that came
over the wire the reply made from
a telephone booth was uttered in the
quiet voice of the shadow

  report

  nothing

  there was a tinge of helpless regret
in burbanks final word the shadows
hidden agent usually unemotional in his
conversation had realized his present
inability to help

  the receiver clattered in the telephone
booth where the shadow stood si-
lence followed while the shadow
planned

  two days had passed since the shad-
ows visit to goldy tancreds apart-
ment in that space of time not one
report of consequence had come from
burbank night had come once more
and with it a new threat of unknown
action by dangerous men of crime

  the door of the phone booth swung
open it was not however a tall black
figure that emerged instead the hud-
dled form of a shifty cap-and-sweat-
ered gangster made its appearance

  the shadow master of disguise was
garbed as a ruffian of the underworld
while burbank waited hopeful for
news to-night the shadow himself
had penetrated into gangdoms terrain

  this was the second successive night
upon which the shadow had visited the
underworld denizens of the badlands
unaware that their common foe was
among them had accepted the disguised
visitant merely as an unrecognized
gangster

  a hardened mobsman in walk ap-
pearance and demeanor the shadow
shuffled away from the little store where
he had made the telephone call his
dragging footsteps-a strange contrast
to the quick glide of a phantom figure
in black-were turning toward one of
the most notorious dives in the bad-
lands

  thoroughly familiar with every
feature of the underworld the shadow
was undertaking a swift and methodical
process of elimination his analysis of
approaching crime had connected goldy
tancred with the activities of some gang
leader one by one the shadow had
visited the hang-outs where representa-
tives of different mobs were wont to ap-
pear

  his keen eyes obscured by the visor
of a wrinkled cap had studied the
bloated faces of a score of sordid mobs-
men his sharp ears had listened for
snatches of conversation yet the
cause had been fruitless the shadow
had learned many facts but none of
them gave evidence of a connection with
the case that now needed his attention

   in the middle of a darkened alley the
shuffling figure paused and turned to
descend a flight of broken stone steps
his hand pushed open a rickety door
with hunched shoulders the visitor en-
tered an underground den where some
two dozen mobsmen were assembled be-
neath the glare of two large incan-
descents

  toughened gunmen turned toward
the doorway as the newcomer appeared
they saw a grimy square-jawed visage
beneath the cap visor somewhat suspi-
ciously they accepted this stranger as
one of their own ilk not one man
present suspected that he was viewing
the shadow

  no mobsman could truthfully boast
that he had ever seen the face of the
shadow there was a few who claimed
that they had seen his mysterious shape


the shadow magazine

and all descriptions agreed that the
shadow was a tall being habitually
garbed in black had this stoop-shoul-
dered gangster announced his true
identity no one in this dive would have
believed his -words

  this was one underworld hang-out
that had no exact title once it had been
called gorkys joint in honor of its pro-
prietor rut gorkys period of owner-
ship had terminated amid a barrage of
gun play that had counted him a victim
since then three proprietors had taken
charge in turn

  nevertheless the place had become
an indiscriminate meeting spot for lesser
gangsters who patronized it as a speak-
easy a melting pot where rival gang-
sters seemed to forget their feuds the
dive had assumed the distinction of a
neutral territory

  the unknown gangster drifted over
to a table at the side of the room he
flung a crumpled dollar bill in front of
him and a grimy-faced waiter brought
in a bottle and a glass the unknown
poured out a long drink but let the glass
stand idle while he stared glumly toward
the barren wall

  drifters of the underworld were here
to-night but among them were a few
who looked like regular mobsmen the
shadow in choosing his table had
picked a spot close by a promising pair
now apparently indifferent to what
was going on about him he was listen-
ing to the conversation of these gun-
men

  its nearly ten oclock came a
growl

  yeah was the reply waitll i
have another drink ill be goin with
you

  youd better be ping aint the guy
thatll stajnd for hokum its a long
jump from here up to the old windsor
theater an weve got to do a sneak
into the back alley when we finally get
there-

  the conversation broke as the gang-

sters prepared to leave the shadow
however had learned all that he needed
to know the objective of the gangsters
could not be the windsor theater it-
self for the old closed playhouse of-
fered no attraction to men of crime
but the mention of the alley alongside
was a give-away a fashionable apart-
ment house was located next door to
the theater and it could well be a lure
to smart crooks

  thaddeus harmon lived in that
building new yorkers had heard
much of him during the past few weeks
a millionaire whose name was fre-
quently in the news thaddeus harmon
had expresed his approval of valuable
gems as an investment

  he had spoken of important pur-
chases which he had made through dia-
mond merchants and it was a known
fact that he had invited wealthy friends
to see the collection of resplendent gems
that he brought back and forth from
storage vault to apartment

  until now the shadow had been un-
able to lay his finger upon the exact type
of crime which might be impending
murder-cold and exacting-had been
the toll at the olympia hotel more
murder-racketeering- blackmail -- all
these had been possibilities

  but the connection of two sullen-
faced gangsters with a rendezvous in a
deserted alley between the windsor
theater and the next-door apartment
was a definite clew that pointed to un-
usual crime

  the men had spoken of one whom
they called ping the shadow knew of
ping slatterly-a gang leader who had
recently dropped out of sight the fact
that these rowdies were connected with
so formidable an evildoer was im-
portant whether or not ping slatterly
was goldy tancreds unidentified asso-
ciate it was in keeping with the shad-
ows policy to impede the progress of
impending crime
the shadow magazine



  such opportunity was here the
shadow had gained a definite mission
with other possibilities exhausted the
investigation had tapered down to a
point where almost any definite warning
of crime could be regarded as a clew
to goldy tancreds enterprise

  as the two mobsmen concluded their
conversation and prepared to leave the
sordid den the shadow shifted away
from the table where he was seated
still playing the part of a wandering
gangster he was about to take up the
trail of these lesser crooks

  the shadow knew their destination
he had knowledge of their possible goal
nevertheless he could accomplish most
by following them often in the past
the shadow had thwarted the schemes
of malefactors by suddenly appearing in
the midst of their trusted cohorts

  once these men were clear of this
speakeasy the shadow could trail them
with ease his slow-motion action at
the table was calculated to give them a
short head start

  the pair had left through the door
by the time the shadow was standing
on the floor with the leisurely shamble
of a purposeless mobster the shadow
moved slowly toward the exit

  his perfect disguise now served him
well many eyes were upon him but
none suspected him to be other than an
unimportant toady of some lesser mob

  there were two stone steps up to the
door on one side was the wall on
the other an iron rail the shadow
reached this point with bowed head
and sullen lips he grasped the rail

  his departure was timed to perfec-
tion but for the intervention of
chance he would have been outside of
the dive within the next few seconds

  an unexpected occurrence stopped
the shadows plan as his forward
foot reached the first of the stone steps
the door of the speakeasy was flung
open a huge broad-shouldered

beefy-faced man stood glowering into
the underground dive his bulky form
blocked the shadows path

  a buzz swept through the room the
newcomer was known to the assembled
crowd he was a hard-boiled gangster
who went under the name of smash
harlow directly behind him was the
stocky figure of his pal bozo guckert

  glancing downward smash harlow
saw the disguised figure of the shadow
he observed a face that was tough and
grimy

  in bullying fashion smash expressed
an immediate dislike toward the person
who blocked his path

  out of the way dopey he growled
whatcha trying to do-hog the whole
doorway 

  guffaws came from mobsters within
the dive

  poke him one smash came an
urging cry he doesnt belong in this
joint anyway

  smash continued to glower when
he aw that the figure before him did
not move away the bullying mobster
did more than try a punch with a
quick jerk he pulled a large revolver
from his pocket and thrust the muzzle
directly toward the hawklike nose that
was before him

  finger on the trigger smash was
ready to shoot down this small-fry
mobster who had no friends

  then came swift action the stoop-
shouldered figure seemed to lengthen
the shadows long left arm shot di-
rectly upward and caught smash har-
lows wrist as the beefy man fired
the bullet took an upward course and
crashed against the stone ceiling

  smash harlow had no opportunity
for another voluntary action the
shadows right arm had caught him
now raised by the crouching form that
wore the sweater smash was lifted clear
from the steps

  with a terrific upward snap his as-
sailant threw him headlong the big


the shadow magazine

mans body whirled as it swept over the
cap which the shadow wore smash
harlows revolver sailed from his grasp
and clattered against the wall a mo-
ment later his bulky form landed prone
upon the floor

  bozo guckert was drawing his re-
volver he never had a chance to use
it straightening forward with in-
credible swiftness the shadow made
a sideswipe with his left fist the blow
knocked the revolver from bozos hand
then with a continued motion the
shadows right arm swung

   a fist like a trip hammer caught bozo
guckert on the chin the powerful
punch lifted the mobster clear over the
rail beside the steps bozo guckert
landed back downward upon a table
where two gangsters were sitting the
flimsy piece of furniture crashed be-
neath his weight

  in the midst of the confusion the
unknown gangster who had so ably de-
fended himself made a swift departure
guns flashed into view shots were fired
at the spot where the shadow had been
the bullets of the excited mobsmen
found no target other than the closing
door

  nevertheless the chase was on
smash harlow and bozo guckert were
popular in this dive half a dozen
gangsters leaped to their feet ready to
avenge the downfall of their friends
the snarling mobsters swarmed to the
exit they reached the alley and fired
pot shots in the dark as they spread out
in different directions

   they could not find their man some-
how-somewhere-he had slipped from
view

  while the mobsmen were hustling
-along the alley the stoop-shouldered
figure which the shadow had chosen
as his disguise appeared from between
two buildings on another street

   swift stealthy and spectacular the
shadow would readily have met his pur-

suers in hand-to-hand combat but on
this occasion he could not afford the
time the encounter with smash har-
low and bozo guckert had consumed
valuable minutes the two gunmen
whom the shadow was following had
gained too great a headway there was
only one course now to make for the
destination which they had named

  this offered obstacles the shadow
still using the pose of a shambling gang-
ster was forced to choose a circuitous
course in order to avoid the mobsmen
who were prowling in search of him
he could not afford to waste precious
moments in purposeless combat

  at last his scurrying figure appeared
upon a street which bore the appearance
of a respectacle neighborhood away
from the borders of the underworld
the shadow was free to make all speed
stooped and hurrying he approached a
powerful coupe that was parked beside
the curb

  it was then that new eyes saw the
huddled figure a challenge came from
across the street as a policeman hurried
up to find out what this sweatered in-
dividual was doing beside the expensive
automobile

	quickly the shadow slipped within
the car his cap dropped to the floor
beside him the sweater seemed to peel
itself from his body it fell also and
from the back of the seat came a
crushed opera hat which popped open
and reached the shadows head just as
the officer arrived

  white hands came up and pressed
against the grimy visage they seemed
to be wiping away the traces of dirt and
with it they were forming a molding
process the action continued as the
officer circled the coupe just as the
policeman thrust a flashlight into the
open window the white hands dropped
to the steering wheel of the car

  hey you came the policemans
growl what are you doing in this
the shadow magazine



    the officers challenge ended with a
 surprised man attired in full-dress

	clothes and wearing an opera hat ques-
 tioning eyes were staring at the open-
 mouthed policeman

   what is it officer came a calm
 voice

   guess i made a mistake sir re-
 turned the policeman thought i saw
 a tough-looking rowdy fooling around
 this car there wasnt anybody trying
 to get in was there

   i saw no one responded the gen-
 tleman at the wheel perhaps if you
 look around a bit you might find the
 man you observed

   the policeman stepped to the side-
 walk and looked in both directions
 grumbling foolishly he came back to
 the coupe the calm-faced man held
 out a license card the officer noted that
 it bore the name lamont cranston

 behind the man who is behind ping
siatterly is another man-hector faw-
cett-a man who under the guise of re-
spectable business furnishes the means
for the nefarious work in this story

  thats not necessary vouchsafed
the policeman sorry to have bothered
you

  i was just about to pull out re-
marked lamont cranston replacing the
card in his pocket i had only been
in the car a minute or two if a man
had been lurking near i should cer-
tainly have seen him

  its all right returned the police-
man go ahead sir ill look around
some more just a suspicious charac-
ter that was all

  lamont cranstons lips wore a
smile as his hands turned the wheel and
the car pulled away the shadow had
worn a double disguise to-night be-
neath his sweater and baggy trousers
was a closely tailored full-dress suit
he was kicking  off the trousers now
the officer had not seen them in the
dark

  the bloated gangster face had
changed to a dignified countenance as if
by magic the difference had lain
partly in expression partly in grimy
make-up which had been quickly wiped
away with skillful motions

  the shadow was now playing the part
of lamont cranston millionaire club-
man well-known in manhattan it was
one of his most effective guises whirl-
ing up fifth avenue the shadow was
bound for the apartment house which
adjoined the old windsor theater

  now however the shadows smile
was grim two delays one at the
dive the other with the officer-these
had obstructed his plan of action there
was no chance to overtake the mobsters
who had gone on duty

  only one possible course could be
taken as lamont cranston the
shadow would appear at thaddeus har-
mons apartment playing the part of an
unexpected guest

  that was the shadows move it was
the method that he must now employ to
cope with crime

chapter viii

in the penthouse

  thaddeus harmon was entertaining
in his penthouse atop the roof of the
apartment house which adjoined the old
windsor theater the apartment
house like many of manhattans huge
residential structures had no name it
was designated merely by its street num-
ber

   the building was only a short distance
west of fifth avenue going along a
cross street from fifth to sixth one
passed the entrance to the apartment
house before reaching the old windsor
theater

  perched upon a building of some
twenty stories in height thaddeus har-
mons penthouse formed an isolated
spot the millionaire had chosen it for
that very reason here to-night he
could entertain wealthy guests in abso-
lute seclusion in fact harmon was
commenting upon that very fact

  standing in the middle of a sumptu-
ous living room with a long thin cigar
clipped between his fingers the million-
aire was addressing a dozen guests who
were seated about the room while he
talked harmon waved his cigar toward
an oddly shaped cabinet that stood
against the wall strong and bulky this
article of furniture had a heavy broad-
hinged top

- there you are remarked the mil-
lionaire nearly half a million dol-
lars worth of gems underneath that lid
the cabinet is unlocked all i have to
do is raise the lid and the jewels will
be accessible to any one who wants
them

  the millionaire paused to smile while
he drew a few long puffs upon his pana-
tella

  i am mentioning a few facts he
continued because certain of my guests
have expressed apprehension regarding
the safety of my valuables they have
wondered why i run what they consider

to be a risk-bringing these jewels up
here and leaving them apparently un-
guarded

  let me inform you that this pent-
house is impregnable were it situated
upon the top of the rock of gibraltar
it could be no safer than it is at the
present moment

  whenever i bring my valuables here
for display i have detectives stationed
in this penthouse and also on the
ground floor of the apartment building
they are private men all capable and
ready for emergency

  there are two ways to reach this
penthouse by elevator the way which
all of you came and through the fire
tower both routes terminate on the
ground floor in this room i have a
special alarm it is operated on a sys-
tem of its own with it i can immedi-
ately notify the men downstairs there
is also the telephone but it is not neces-
sary to rely upon it

  should any dangerous persons en-
ter here-and entrance would not be
difficult-they would find it quite a task
to capture the jewels with my men on
guard should they succeed they
would find escape the great problem
the sounding of the alarm would enable
the men below to trap them

  no matter what might occur my
men below will remain at their stations
in the lobby until they hear the special
alarm which cannot fail to work or re-
ceive a direct telephone call from this
penthouse so be at ease every one
my possessions are quite secure

  the guests seemed pleased at thad-
deus harmons assurance they had
all learned that detectives were present
it was easy to pick out the quartet of
sleuths who were stationed in the room
the additional precautions however
came as an interesting revelation

  when the rest of my guests arrive
declared harmon i shall show the
gems to the entire company there are
the shadow magazine



only two or three who are not yet here
i expect them shortly

  a few seconds after the millionaire
concluded the telephone rang thad-
deus harmon answered it himself he
repeated names of persons who were
announced from the lobby then a
pleased expression came upon his face

  ah he exclaimed you say that
mr lamont cranston is calling yes
indeed tell him to come up with the
others

  hanging up the receiver harmon an-
nounced that the final guests were now
on their wray to the elevator he added
that another visitor was coming up with
them

  you will enjoy meeting lamont
cranston he stated the man is a con-
noisseur where valuable gems are con-
cerned he has a remarkable collection
of his own and every jewel is unique
a great traveler cranston i did not
know that he had arrived back in town

  his presence will be most welcome
as i have acquired two diamonds which
he may be able to identify wonderful
legends attach themselves to certain
gems to me such stories when veri-
fied are quite as valuable as the stones
themselves

  thaddeus harmon motioned to two
of the detectives the men strolled
across the living room and stationed
themselves beside the cabinet which con-
tained the collection of jewels the
other pair of sleuths took positions near
the outer door

  this was evidently the final precau-
tion as soon as the late guests had
been welcomed the curiosity of the vis-
itors would be satisfied with the jew-
els under competent guard the collec-
tion would be viewed in safety

  thaddeus harmon turned toward the
door of his living room and glanced
out into an anteroom which served also
as an elevator corridor he could just
see the bulky door of the fire tower
past the row of elevators

  the millionaires gaze turned toward
the elevator shafts his manner seemed
expectant in fact harmon was as
anxious to reveal his gems as his guests
were to see them

  soon one of those heavy elevator
doors would open to admit the final
members of the privileged group whom
thaddeus harmon had invited here to-
night

  a vertical row of tiny incandescents
was set beside each elevator harmon
noticed the lowest light of one row the
bulb flickered the one above it lighted
the indicators changed in slow suc-
cession this elevator was coming up
it was bringing the final visitors-with
them lamont cranston

  puffing his panatella thaddeus har-
mon serenely watched the indicated
progress a quiet gray-haired gentle-
man the millionaire had a habit of for-
getting all about him while he watched
something that consumed his interest
he was entirely oblivious to the con-
versation of his guests as he counted
the floors that the elevator was passing

  sixteen--seventeen-harmons lips
were silently forming the numbers-
eighteen-

  the count ended without an in-
stants warning the penthouse was
blanketed in complete darkness even
the lights of the elevator indicator went
out as the pall of gloom fell

  with all the thickness of a cloudy
blackened night a fearsome darkness
seemed to tell of impending disaster
even the windows of the apartment
were blotted out completely

  impenetrable gloom had taken full
command the entire building was
wrapped in a shroud that prevented the
entrance of even a distant glare

  yet the completeness of that dark
was not fully comprehended by those
who were within it other phenomena
had occurred as well with that stroke
of blackness not only the electric lights


the shadow magazine

but every other current-controlled de-
vice within the entire building had
failed

  the rising elevator was stalled mid-
way between the eighteenth and the
nineteenth floors telephone service was
automatically ended the special alarm
between the penthouse and the ground
floor was rendered worthless

  gasps of surprise and fright seemed
muffled as they came from the lips of
thaddeus harmons guests the sen-
sation of a choking suffocating power
gripped every one the darkness had
the reality of a solid substance it
menaced it throttled it brought a fear
of blindness

  those within the pall scarcely dared
to move hands clawed feebly at chair
arms persons arose to grope their way
to a less dreadful spot then dropped
back to their seats awed by the terrible
sensation

  caught by hideous alarm thaddeus
harmon spent every ounce of effort as
he managed to move slowly back into the
living room this weird darkness
savored of the unknown its terror
caused the millionaire to tremble

  it was the strangeness of the thick
gloom that produced this effect actu-
ally those within it were free agents
yet the unbelievable condition of ab-
solute dark could not be combated by
these persons who were experiencing
it for the first time

  a menace shrouded the atmosphere
of the penthouse the black hush had
come and in its wake crime was due
to follow 

chapter ix

the robbery

  invisible men were moving through
thick darkness while silence still per-
sisted in thaddeus harmons living
room the invasion of crime was on its
way issuing from the door of the fire
tower ping slatterly and his group of

henchmen were coming through the
gloom

  the sound of the advance had not
reached the group in the penthouse liv-
ing room there thaddeus harmon
was groping his way to the alarm
switch

  detectives were trying to get results
with their flashlights-all in vain even
these appliances had succumbed to the
strange force of the black hush

  a match flickered  its illumination did
not carry far even the face of the
guest who had ignited it was not dis-
tinguishable it needed greater light
than that to pierce this thick haze of
blackness

  the light came from the doorway
the glare of a bulls-eye lantern flashed
suddenly into view supplied by acesjfr
lene this instrument of illumination
brought a strange brilliance throughout
the living room guests and detectives
were staring at the bright spot through
a murky atmosphere

  a voice spoke from behind the lan-
tern its tones were uttegl in a harsh
growl that was plainly atble despite
the muffling effect that pervaded the
air

  weve got ou covered-ping slat-
terly was talking-and the first one
that moves gets bumped do you savvy
that stick up your mitts 

  thaddeus harmon yanked the alarm
just as slattery spoke then the mil-
lionaire backed against the wall with
arms upraised his action was followed
promptly by his guests the detectives
in turn sullenly obeyed pings com-
mand the suddenness of the attack
had caught them completely unprepared

  were not worryin about that
alarm informed ping in his harsh
voice yank it again if you want
try the telephone too it wont do
you no good

  his words were followed by an order
to his henchmen two roughly garbed
invaders stepped into the glare of the
the shadow magazine



acetylene light between them they
were carrying a double-handled bag
these men were masked it was impos-
sible to identify them as they moved
straight toward the cabinet against the
wall

  while the detectives remained help-
less under the threat of unseen guns one
of the mobsters opened the top of the
cabinet grimy hands dipped into the
large jewel chest out came sparkling
gems which were dropped into the bag
in glittering array

  thaddeus harmon forgot caution
the sight of his valuable collection of
precious stones taken openly before his
eyes was too much for the maddened
millionaire he made no attempt to at-
tack the robbers but he did follow the
advice which ping stfatterly had sug-
gested

  seizing the telephone harmon raised
the instrument from its hook and tried
to establish a connection the experi-
ment convinced him that the leader of
the invaders had spoken the truth the
telephone was dead

  ping slatterly laughed his workers
were completing their job in rapid time
the top of the cabinet descended with a
thump that sounded muffled in the
gloom the gang leader saw a detective
shift uneasily he growled an order

  a revolver spoke through the dark-
ness its suppressed roar was a warn-
ing a bullet flattened itself against
the wall above the detectives head the
threat was sufficient

  remember-slatterlys tone fol-
lowed the abbreviated echoes of the re-
volver shot-the first guy that moves
gets drilled were leavin you-but
well be back quick enough if anybody
tries to make trouble it wont be safe
to try anythin until the lights come on
again forget these sparklers if you
know whats good for you savvy

  the men were backing away from the
cabinet one was lugging the bag the

other had a revolver in his hand and
was turning it menacingly in all direc-
tions

  thaddeus harmon groaned at the
thought of his plight

  this unexplainable situation was one
for which he had not provided fully
did he realize the helplessness of the
present conditions the elimination of
light throughout the apartment house
would mean nothing to the men sta-
tioned on the ground floor there was
no reason for them to suspect trouble
in the penthouse unless they received
a summons by telephone or heard the
specially wired alarm

  the invaders had come from the fire
tower they would depart by the same
route in this amazing blackness which
only the acetylene torch seemed capable
of penetrating they could make a swift
escape already they had captured the
jewels half a million dollars was slip-
ping away unhindered

  pursuit 

  harmon realized that it would be im-
possible until after the crooks had made
good their escape they could easily
barricade the door of the fire tower be-
hind them a hurried flight down the
stairway of the tower-that would con-
clude the raid

  the millionaire knew that the elevator
service like lights telephone and alarm
had been interrupted harmon and his
detectives were trapped here in the pent-
house until the black hush ended
they could not move

  ping slatterly still out of sight
behind the glare of the acetylene light
was emitting a gloating chuckle he
knew that his warning would be heeded
no one would dare move until com-
plete illumination returned it would
be suicidal even after the acetylene lamp
had been extinguished pings threat
of lurkers in the dark was too potent to
forget

  events had passed swiftly since the


the shadow magazine

one was lugging
the bag the other
had a revolver in
his hand   

invaders had arrived the purloining
of the gems had been a rapid action
less than four minutes had elapsed
since the black hush had fallen up to
the time of the warning shot that had
ended all thoughts of resistance or at-
tempted recovery of the stolen wealth

pijjg slatterly had estimated that the
descent through the fire tower would re-

quire no more than four additional min-
utes this allowed for a complete
escape before any one outside of the
penthouse could possibly know that
trouble had occurred here

until the black hush was lifted these
people would be helpless knowledge
of that fact was the only reason why
ping had desisted from murder this
shad-a
the shadow magazine



fiendish gang leader would gladly have
massacred the helpless detectives but he
was under orders to concentrate upon
the removal of the gems

  all that he wanted was a good ex-
cuse to shoot some helpless victims
the warning shot had shown the ten-
dency of ping slatterlys evil brain to-
ward killing

  giving the command to retire ping
began to back away from the door of the
penthouse living room with his men
crouching backward with him the male-
factor engineered a steady retreat until
he was standing close beside the door
of the fire tower

  a growl from a henchman told ping
that the barrier was open the way was
ready for the swift escape ping slat-
terly paused he rasped an order for
the others to stand by

  the glare from the acetylene search-
light still illuminated the entire living
room through a peculiar dusky haze
faces were visible in strained white-
ness frightened guests-sullen detec-
tives-ping viewed them with disdain

  the gang leaders gaze turned toward
thaddeus harmon the millionaire
alone uncowed wore a look of defiance
his expression aroused ping slatterlys
complete antagonism the gang leader
snarled in the gloom

  instructions flashed through pings
hostile mind he had been told to get
the jewels to make an effective get-
away  and to stay his gun until its use
proved necessary murder was ping
slatterlys forte he saw good occasion
for it now

  only one man among the helpless peo-
ple in the room seemed capable of plan-
ning action against the crooks that
one was thaddeus harmon why not
eliminate him

  in moments of quick thought ping
saw the advantage to harmon the
jewels were of prime importance to the
others the welfare of the millionaire
was the chief consideration

 shad-a

  if thaddeus hafmon fell riddled by
bullets a second before the acetylene
light made its exit the only thoughts of
the remaining people would be the fear
of death that terror would persist
and when the penthouse lights returned
confusion would occur at the sight of
thaddeus harmons slain body

  with cool deliberation the evil gang
leader raised his revolver ready to
loose unexpected death he held the bril-
liant lantern steadily in his left hand
taking aim with the weapon in his right
hold it growled ping to his
clustered companions wait until i
cut loose with this smoke wagon then
well scram

  with final deliberation ping slat-
terly belittled the consequences he
could explain matters to his associates
murder did not matter so long as the
robbery had been completed success
would stifle criticism

  thaddeus harmons life was hanging
in the balance the crime of death was
to follow lawless entry and theft ping
slatterly gloated as he prepared to slay
the helpless millionaire one minute
more then the enveloping shroud of
the black hush would close upon a scene
of murder

chapter x

shots from the shaft

  ping slatterlys powerful light had
carved a beam through the blackness
that pervaded the penthouse the awe-
some pall of the black hush had not
however been dispelled elsewhere
within the elevator that was bringing
guests upward a solid block of im-
penetrable gloom had struck with amaz-
ing power

  the car had come to a stop midway
between two floors the startled gasps
of the passengers had died upon fright-
ened lips after the first seconds of
astonishment a muffled terror had
gripped quivering hearts


the shadow magazine

  among those passengers so suddenly
invisible to each other was one to whom
the coming of blackness had brought no
awe this person was the unexpected
guest whom thaddeus harmon had
been so eager to welcome namely la-
mont cranston

  within the darkness of the elevator
cranstons first action wras to press his
hands against the interior wall of the
car probing fingers found a crevice
they wedged a metal implement into it

  a hushed click in the gloom was un-
noticed by the terrified passengers who
were mumbling incoherent comments to
each other the side of the car when
it came slowly inward disturbed no
one

  the shadow working in the dark-
ness had opened the emergency door in
the side of the car this barrier was
designed for the removal of passengers
from one elevator to another at pres-
ent it was useless for this purpose
there had been no opportunity to bring
a second car up alongside the stalled
lift

  the shadow however used the open-
ing for another purpose his invisible
form slid through the unlocked side of
the car the door closed and clicked
behind him as he clung to the outside of
the elevator then with calm precision
he clutched the front wall of the shaft
and raised his long body upward

  while ping slatterly and his men
were effecting the robbery in the pent-
house the shadow silent and un-
known was ascending the interior of the
elevator shaft fighting his way upward
through the deep gloom of the all-per-
vading hush of blackness

  strangely the progress of this invisi-
ble being was timed with ping slatter-
lys actions at the very moment when
the gang leader paused with his men at
the open door of the fire tower the hand
of the shadow clutched the door of
the elevator shaft on the penthouse
level i

  while ping was giving his final or-
ders the shadows hands were work-
ing with the barrier the heavy door
moved slowly open the gleam of the
acetylene light greeted the shadows
eyes

  the door of the shaft was outside the
range of slatterlys special searchlight
the thick gloom of the black hush cov-
ered all of the shadows actions ping
slatterly could not see the phantom
form emerging through the door of the
shaft nor could the shadow observe
pings outline behind the glare of the
acetylene lantern

  nevertheless the shadows actions
were identical with those of the gang
leader while ping slatterly was draw-
ing and leveling his revolver the hand
of the shadow was bringing forth an
automatic to handle it with deadly aim

  each had a different target ping
slatterlys objective was thaddeus
harmon the shadows was the gleam-
ing lantern that hung from ping slat-
terlys left fist

  trigger fingers poised unknown to
each other a mans life was mo-
mentarily at stake in that tense mo-
ment of decision the chances seemed
equal that ping or the shadow would
fire first

  one element of mental reaction alone
decided the result ping slatterly con-
fident and firm in the belief that thad-
deus harmon was a helpless victim let
his finger linger the shadow know-
ing that the cowed group in the living
room were at the mercy of lawless in-
vaders did not pause

  a shot rang out in the darkness the
powerful roar of an automatic forced
its mighty sound through the repressing
gloom with that shot came a metallic
crash as the shadows bullet shattered
the lantern in ping slatterlys hand

  the lantern was extinguished down
came the pall of the black hush like a
dropping cloud of ghostly darkness a
the shadow magazine



second shot broke the tension the
shadow delivered a pot shot in the di-
rection of his first this time he had
no target but his aim was limited to
the small area by the fire-tower door

  instinctively the people in the living
room scrambled for safety they had
lost their awe of the black hush in face
of the gun-fire menace ping slatterly
and his gangsters began a frenzied at-
tack with their revolvers as they clu-
tered toward the exit

  some were shooting wildly toward the
living room these shots were futile
for the range was wide and the people
there had dropped to shelter others
aimed toward the elevators these also
fired vainly the shadow had dropped
back through the barrier only his steady
hand projecting with its weapon and
his keen eyes darting into the gloom

  smudgy flashes of flame from gang-
ster revolvers gave the shadow the
targets that he needed each spurt
from the fire-tower door gave the
shadow a new opportunity with each
burst of his automatic he dropped back
into the shaft only to emerge for a new
response

  shots came from the living room
the detectives were crawling forward
to action the shadow was forced to
stay his fire

  the elevator door closed shut bul-
lets battered against it the sleuths
not knowing from whence aid had
come were firing toward the elevators as
well as the fire tower

  had the detectives not intervened
the shadow by his skillful tactics
might well have stayed the flight of the
gangsters the new turn of events
however compelled him to withhold his
fire with no new shots coming from
the elevators the detectives directed all
their efforts toward the corner exit

  coming through the darkness firing
as they advanced they stumbled over
prostrate forms then the heavy door

pressed shut the sleuths beat vainly
at the barricade the gangsters had
fled leaving some of their companions
on the floor

  a revolver spurted from a wounded
gangsters fist it brought a frenzied
response from the detectives guns
fearing stabbing bullets from the floor
the sleuths emptied their revolvers

  who had escaped who remained
where were the jewels these were
questions that the gloom withheld
then one prowling detective made an
accidental discovery as he stumbled over
an object on the floor

  the jewel bag

  the sleuths blurting cry came to his
comrades ears they gathered round
about him clutching at the bag to make
sure it had been recovered

  flashlights were still useless matches
glimmered feebly and cast an insuffi-
cient glare in the confusion the ele-
vator door was forgotten no one could
hear its muffled opening obscured in
the total darkness the shadow arose
from the floor and closed the door be-
hind him

  his form moved silently into the liv-
ing room there when the lights came
on he would be among the guests

  let the detectives blunder on there
was no need to aid them now some of
the mobsters had escaped but the
shadow knew that their purpose had
been thwarted

  soon the black hush would lift then
amid restored light the result of the
shadows might would be revealed

chapter xi

the hush lifts

  one minute longer

  the voice of hector fawcett was
speaking in the corner office of the suite
in the judruth tower ninety-three
stories above the street the president of
the climax corporation was staring
from the opened window


the shadow magazine

  the room was dark save for the
slight glimmer of a chromium-plated
apparatus  close beside him the
strange machine from the storeroom
was in use a breathing sound denoted
the presence of another man at the con-
trol switch

  the lamplike portion of the odd
mechanism was turned at a downward
angle from it extended a conical
widening beam like the ray of a power-
ful searchlight but this shaft was dif-
ferent from any projected illumination

  instead of light the machine was fo-
cusing blackness downward toward the
city through the dim glow that showed
from the lights of manhattan a shaft
of complete darkness was spreading its
mysterious ray

  just as the glare of a searchlight
might carve through the night and
spread a circle of bright illumination
upon its objective so did this amazing
beam do its work in direct opposition
the lights of buildings were glimmer-
ing below but the spot where the black
ray ended was totally dark

  picked from among neighboring
structures the entire surface of the
apartment house beside the old windsor
theater was blotted out from view

  focused darkness-a beam of night
-black light this was the power that
was in operation to-night it was the
force that had iain the strange lull of
the black hush throughout thaddeus
harmons penthouse

 good work-hobbs-

  hector fawcett chuckled as he
paused upon the name by which he had
addressed his companion there was
significance in fawcetts tone it indi-
cated understanding

  only these two men were witnessing
the distant effect of the strange demon-
stration of new science from their
towering vantage point they were cre-
ating a mysterious result

  one edifice in manhattan was black-
ened  not only was it in total darkness

but the tremendous force this gloom-
projecting beam had also wreaked tem-
porary havoc with all electrical equip-
ment in its path

  hector fawcett consulted the lu-
minous dial of his wrist watch time
was up the man lingered however
to enjoy a few more seconds of this
sight which intrigued him fawcetts
eye followed the spreading wedge of
darkness it dwelt approvingly on the
splotch of blackness that indicated the
position of the hushed apartment house
then in a regretful tone the corpora-
tion president gave the final order to
the man at the controls

  time up

  the man by the machine pressed a
lever

  the effect was magical the black
beam disappeared where complete
obliteration had marked the presence of
a building a host of twinkling lights
sprang into being

  below the indirect glow of the great
city the outline of thaddeus harmons
penthouse showed atop the apartment
building windows shone indicating
the position of the living room hector
fawcett chuckled

  he had seen this phenomenon before
with his same companion the man
whom he addressed as hobbs he had
observed the effect of the black beam
upon the olympia hotel once again
a barrage of darkness had been lain and
lifted so that a time space for swift and
effective crime might be created

  there was confidence in hector faw-
cetts chuckle it was answered by a
pleased mumble from hobbs both men
knew the all-pervading force of the
power that they had loosed projected
on a perfectly arranged schedule the
black hush had given full opportunity
to men of crime

  gleeful thoughts were humming
through hector fawcetts cunning brain
he was inspired by the surety of evil

the lamplike portion of the odd mechanism was turned at a downward
angle from it extended    a shaft of complete darkness

now accomplished he was considering
the confusion that must surely reign in
the place from which gems valued at
half a million had been stolen

  the scene in the penthouse was how-
ever quite different from the mental
picture which hector fawcett bad cre-
ated the restoration of the lights


the shadow magazine

came with amazing suddenness black-
ness  then dazzling illumination

  blinking wondering eyes of fright-
ened guests were staring at the strange
results which had occurred in thaddeus
harmons penthouse

  people were spread all about in cor-
ners behind chairs in other spots of
safety but the guests paid no atten-
tion to each other the place of interest
was the corridor outside the living room
there lay the results of thwarted crime

  the bodies of two gunmen were hud-
dled upon the floor both men were
dead the shadows bullets had brought
them down amid the darkness the
detectives fearing that the men were
still in ambush had riddled them with
shots

  two sleuths were still pounding at
the closed door of the fire tower the
other two were crouched upon the floor
grasping the bag which had fallen from
the hand of the robber who had held it

  thaddeus harmon sprang forward
with a cry of delight he knew that
his precious jewels had been saved
the other guests relieved in turn were
crowding close behind him

  the telephone began to ring the
pulled alarm switch was functioning
now tiny lights flickered by the ele-
vator shaft the stalled car had re-
sumed its progress the metal door
opened and the delayed guests surged
forth pleased at their release from
bondage

  amid the chaos a tall dignified gen-
tleman stepped calmly across the corri-
dor and joined the cluster of people who
had come from the elevator thaddeus
harmon guiding the detectives back
into the living room jostled against his
new group of guests turning he spied
lamont cranston for it was he who
had just joined the others from the ele-
vator

  singling cranston as the most im-
portant of the newcomers harmon ex-
tended a hand in greeting and began a

series of explanations cranston and
the others who had been in the elevator
listened with intense interest

  burglars exclaimed harmon
they must have done something to the
electrical equipment they threw out
everything-lights telephone alarm

  they were getting away with my
collection of gems fortunately i had
detectives on hand my men were afraid
to fire for fear of bringing a reprisal
but when the burglars started to shoot
of their own accord our detectives en-
tered into it

  we landed two of the crooks the
rest managed to escape it was won-
derful work wonderful the crim-
inals were forced to drop the bag in
which they had the jewels the ones
that eluded us fled down the fire tower

  congratulations mr harmon re-
marked lamont cranston in a quiet
tone your detectives are to be com-
mended we were unfortunately un-
able to assist we were stranded in the
elevator a few floors below-

  it is as well that you were not here
observed harmon seriously the situ-
ation was very dangerous you were
fortunate not to be present mr cran-
ston

  the faint trace of a smile appeared
upon lamont cranstons thin lips as
thaddeus harmon moved away little
did harmon realize that he had been
talking to the one person whose timely
stroke had saved a fortune

  well had the shadow concealed his
hand to-night as for the detectives
their presence was a matter of regret
without their interference the shadow
might have gained a complete triumph
over ping slatterly and his mobsmen

  the shadow master of darkness had
used the black hush to his own ad-
vantage it had been the covering
shroud from which he had brought
down two desperate crooks-one of
them the jewel carrier now as la-
the shadow magazine



mont cranston the shadow strolled to
the spot where the bodies lay

  he studied the faces of the dead
gangsters he recognized immediately
that neither was ping slatterly the
leader was among those who had
escaped

  the menace of new crime still loomed
in full intensity for ping slatterly was
unquestionably the only one of to-
nights invaders who could be regarded
as a cogwheel in the schemes of those
who controlled the weird black hush

  lamont cranston joined the peo-
ple in the living room the jewels were
back in their cabinet guests still quiv-
ering from excitement were gradually
regaining their composure lamont
cranston idled while the confusion died
away

  time drifted by at last the door of
an elevator opened and a stocky
swarthy-faced man stepped forth one
of the private detectives noticed him
and went to greet him he brought the
arrival to thaddeus harmon

  detective cardona from headquar-
ters was the announcement

  thaddeus harmon shook hands with
the star sleuth cardona began a ques-
tioning he turned to men who were
with him and sent them to investigate
the fire tower he called downstairs
and ordered the manager of the apart-
ment up to the penthouse

  only a few guests still remained when
cardona had completed his investiga-
tion the star detective about to leave
paused to speak with thaddeus har-
mon

  this shows you how crooks work
vouchsafed cardona a couple of
nights ago some gangsters tried to put
goldy tancred on the spot they man-
aged to get at the main switch in the
olympia hotel then they bungled by
killing the wrong men

  now here comes another gang thats
out for burglary they heard about the

stunt at the olympia they knew we
hadnt spotted anybody monkeying with
the switch so they tried the same gag
when they came after your jewels
but the telephone-the alarm-
harmons reply was insistent they
managed to eliminate those also--
they were just more thorough thats
all interposed cardona weve gone
over the whole works were going to
make another electrical inspection well

find out-

  a puzzled frown appeared upon the
detectives brow to cardonas ears
had come a strange mysterious sound
-a whispered echo from the past the
sibilant note of a faint laugh-a mirth-
ful tone that the detective recognized
the laugh of the shadow

  what did it mean cardona knew
that laugh he had heard it under
strange circumstances he knew that it
meant doom to crooks that it had in-
tervened more than once in his own be-
half whence had the laugh come

  cardona turned quickly he half
expected to see the sinister shape of a
tall black-garbed being he stared at
the walls-at the floor-almost believing
that the shadow would materialize
from nowhere

  but the only person whom cardona
noted was a dignified man who was
standing a few paces away cardona
glanced at this persons face the de-
tective had never seen the visage of the
shadow but he did know the power of
the shadows eyes

 no this man could not be the
shadow cranstons gaze was mild de-
spite its steadiness cardona shrugged
his shoulders as he turned away and
headed toward the elevator the detec-
tive tried to convince himself that he
had imagined those faint echoes of a
laugh

  the effort was difficult for as car-
dona strode along he fancied that hid-
den eyes were watching him the de-
tective did not turn instead he tried


the shadow magazine

to forget this new effect that was dis-
turbing him

  had cardona turned had he again
studied lamont cranstons face then
would he have known that fact not
fancy was at work an amazing change
had come into lamont cranstons eyes
those mild orbs were burning with a
weird uncanny light

  the elevator door clanged behind joe
cardona lamont cranston stood alone
by the door of thaddeus harmons liv-
ing room a soft laugh came from
thin unmoving lips its whispered
echoes were an eerie aftermath to that
stifling hush which had so recently per-
vaded this penthouse

  there was knowledge in the shad-
ows laugh the strange mockery that
had derided cardonas decision was
something that spoke of higher deduc-
tion by hand the shadow had
thwarted crime by brain he was seek-
ing an explanation of the protection
which had so effectively aided the bur-
glars up to the time of his arrival

  where cardona had overlooked many
minor facts the shadow in the guise
of lamont cranston had studied clews
he had heard one of the private detec-
tives commenting upon the fact that his
flashlight had failed to function in the
darkness

  the sleuth however had forgotten
the matter as promptly as cardona had
disregarded the inefficiency of his own
flashlight on the night at the olympia
hotel

  to the shadow this was an im-
portant clew it brought him the knowl-
edge that he needed the finger of
the shadow was on the throbbing pulse
of mystery inspections of the elec-
trical equipment in the apartment build-
ing would be useless

  the shadow knew that some blanket-
ing force had counteracted all electric
devices during the invasion of crime
he had felt the lull of the black hush

he had detected in it a strange signifi-
cance of the unknown

  to find the mysterious scientific
power that had produced the unaccount-
able phenomenon was the mission that
lay ahead the shadow knew that the
source of crime must lie in the secret
of the black hush

  that weird force had lifted but it
was due to fall again not here where
crime had failed but at a new spot
where its menacing power would cover
the perpetration of another lawless out-
rage

  wherever the black hush might strike
next there must the shadow be to
meet it

  the shadow knew

thats all it wasnt my fault goldy
it was too tough a job

  maybe you werent tough enough to
spring it rasped goldy did you try
to figure it out from that angle

  it was all in the bag goldy pro-
tested ping all in the bag-

  but you left the bag there eh in-
terposed the big shot with a sarcastic
leer

  i didnt leave it declared ping
somebody winged goofy zelleno he
had the bag in his mitt i thought he
had scrammed some dick plugged the
light then we had to dive out in the
dark

  so thats that commented goldy
well im giving you a break ping
the shadow magazine



youve got the mob all set-so you
can do a new job to-morrow night
sure thing

  goldy tancred produced a sheet of
paper from the jacket of his showy
dressing gown he unfolded the paper
and handed it to ping slatterly

  read it over ordered the big shot
that gives you the whole layout of the
new job

  ping slatterly studied the document
a slow grin appeared upon his ugly lins
he finished his perusal and gave the
paper back to its owner

  say goldy he exclaimed thats

a real lay the new city bank--

  pings voice stopped as the gang
leader caught a scowl on goldy tan-
creds face the big shot sneered con-
temptuously bewildered ping looked
for an explanation of the action

  smart arent you quizzed goldy
why do you think i gave you this
written layout ill tell you why-be-
cause i didnt want you to open your
mouth about it the first thing that
you do is begin to talk

  i didnt get the idea responded
ping in a sullen tone you always
used to talk about what you wanted
done

  not any more ping

  wearing a cryptic grin goldy tan-
cred struck a match and ignited the pa-
per which bore the plans for the next
crime he let the sheet burn nearly to
his finger tips then blew out the flame
and let the ashes drop with the charred
remainder into a metal wastebasket

  theres been some double-crossing
around here remarked goldy i dont
know whos responsible for it but i can
show you the result come here

  he led this visitor to the corner by
the window the bookcase had been
drawn a few feet away from the end
wall goldy pointed to the half of a
rubber ball which was adhering to the
wall like a suction cap

  what is it  questioned ping slat-
terly

  goldy tancred held his finger to his
lips ping nodded that he understood
the command for silence goldy pulled
the rubber hemisphere from the wall
and revealed the microphone attachment
he covered the apparatus with the im-
provised mufher and pressed the half
ball so it stayed in place again

  a dictograph declared goldy its
been here a couple of days at least
thats why im playing mum just to
get the habit they cant hear anything
over the line since i covered it up with
the silencer i invented

  a good stunt commended ping
but say goldy-who put that thing in
here-and where does it go

  thats the trouble said the big shot
its got me guessing ping i figured
maybe it was some gag cardona worked
up-just to see if he could find out who
was after me but-when i traced the
line what do you think i found
somebody at the other end

  no snarled goldy if there had
been it would have been too bad for the
guy its smarter than that ping this
thing is hooked up to a telephone in an
empty apartment i cant trace it from
there on

  why didnt you rip it out  queried

ping

  and let the guy know im wise
scoffed goldy no sir i keep it cov-
ered up except when i talk with curry
once in a while then i take the lid
off if anybody is listening they dont
hear anything important curry was
the one who found the thing

  how 

  happened to be shifting the book-
case spotted the hook-up new
listen ping youve got your orders
you remember what i showed you on
that paper be ready thats all lay
low until the right time ive got the
rest fixed

  ping nodded


the shadow magazine

  whats more added the big shot t
dont want you to take any chances com-
ing in here cardona is still squawk-
ing that there must be somebody trying
to get me-and he thinks its the same
bozo who bumped off those two elec-
trical engineers at the olympia

  it wouldnt be funny would it if
he spotted you around here he might
think you were the bird he wanted-
and in a way hed be right you never
were after me but that wouldnt mat-
ter if cardona suspected you of that
double killing-

  say-pings interruption came as
a protest-whats the use of goin back
to that goldy  i thought you said that
we were goin to keep mum around
here

  the dictograph is covered smiled
goldy nevertheless youre right
about it ping im glad i worried you
some-it wont do you any harm thats
all you know the lay do your fade-
out

  ping slatterly laughed and strode to-
ward the door curry met him there
and went along with him to the usual
route on the floor below

  goldy tancred picked out a com-
fortable chair and sat down to light a
cigarette while puffing away he
looked up to see bowser riggins at the
door

  the bodyguard nudged his thumb to-
ward the bookcase goldy laughed and
nodded

  got it muffled he said pull off
the cap bowser then well talk a
lot of foolishness and let them listen in
to nothing

  the bodyguard went to the corner
and removed the rubber hemisphere
he started chatting with goldy and the
big shot responded none of their talk
had any bearing upon current crime
goldy seemed to enjoy the farce of pro-
viding a distant listener with useless in-
formation

  curry appeared at the door he made
a gesture that indicated a new visitor
goldy raised his eyebrows as though
questioning curry about the importance
of the person outside

  its the reporter explained the
servant you know the one i mean-
this fellow burke from the classic 
show him in ordered goldy no
-just a minute curry

  while the servant paused goldy
signaled to bowser to again cover the
apparatus on the wall the big shot
had decided that some turn of the re-
porters conversation might prove trou-
blesome goldy never placed too much
confidence in any newspaperman

  curry waited until bowser had capped
the hidden microphone then he went
to usher in clyde burke goldy tan-
cred settled back in his chair while
bowser riggins sauntered to his usual
post beside the window ledge

  lounging comfortably goldy in-
dulged in one of his most flashy smiles
a greeting for the new visitor it was
the big shots most effective mask
affable friendly and quietly at ease
goldy tancred did not look the part
of a man who had plotted crime

  yet not more than a dozen minutes
prior to clyde burkes new visit ping
slatterly had gone forth from this
apartment bearing orders that would
bring another stroke of hidden crime

chapter xiii

the shadow speaks

  hello burke greeted goldy tan-
cred when the reporter appeared why
the visit  anything new 

  nothing new returned the reporter
thats why im here

  yeah laughed goldy well
youve come to the wrong place i told
you all i knew the other night

  listen goldy--clyde spoke in a
confidential tone as he drew up a chair
-ive been talking to cardona-
the shadow magazine



sounding him out a bit-on the subject
of that list you said he had

  well

  cardona is too close mouthed he
wouldnt give me any kind of a lead so

i just figured that perhaps you-

  that id tell you what you wanted
to know 

  yes

  goldy tancred laughed uproariously
bowser riggins grinned in appreciation
of his chiefs merriment clyde burke
remained serene

  thats a hot idea burke remarked
goldy after he had recovered from his
laughter cardona wont tell you what
he thinks so you come around to me
youre working in circles trying to
pump me all over again trying to make
a lot of trouble

  not at all returned the reporter
who served as the shadows agent
figure it this way goldy i get
around places and i hear a lot of
things that cardona doesnt -all right
if somebody is trying to put you on the
spot it wont hurt for me to find it
out will it

  i get the idea said goldy as his
smile became unpleasant you want
me to take you on as a stool pigeon
is that it  fine work for a newspaper
reporter

  put it that way if you want re-
turned burke just the same its only
part of my job look here goldy if i
can spot the fellow who killed reardon
and furness it will be a scoop for the
classic it wont do you any harm-
maybe it will do you some good
nothing doing growled goldy
im out of it-see thats all ive got
to say

  the finality of the big shots tone in-
dicated that the interview was ended
clyde burke smiled and shrugged his
shoulders he arose and turned toward
the door

  so long said goldy resuming his
affable tone that means you too

bowser scram ive seen enough of
you to-night

  the bodyguard joined clyde burke
but as he strolled to the door bowser
caught a glimpse of goldy tancreds
right hand the big shot was holding
his first two fingers crossed

  bowser knew the meaning of the sig-
nal he was to repeat it at the door
of the hotel lobby seen by a lurker
across the street it was a sign that
burke should be followed until further
orders

  something in the reporters manner
had excited goldys suspicion perhaps
it was the fact that burke while con-
versing had stared directly across the
room toward the bookcase at any rate
goldy was inclined to consider burke
as a menace the big shot picked up
a telephone called a number and con-
ducted a short conversation with a party
at the other end

  there was reason for the big shots
suspicion clyde burke had overplayed
his part to-night he had come here
with a purpose other than his interview
as an agent of the shadow he had
been sent to study goldy tancreds liv-
ing room

  it was clyde burke who had informed
the shadow of the convenient bookcase
by the window wall the shadow in
turn had installed the dictograph bur-
bank however had reported poor re-
sults

  the hidden listener had noted inter-
ruption in various conversations this
had been due to goldys system of cap-
ping the microphone and uncovering it
at intervals even to-night bowser
riggins had not covered the mechanism
until after clyde burke had arrived
therefore the voice of the reporter had
not passed over the wire despite the
fact that he had been definitely ad-
mitted to goldys living room

such incidents during the past day
had led burbank to believe that the ap-


the shadow magazine

paratus had been discovered the hid-
den contact man had forwarded that in-
formation to the shadow in return
he had been instructed to send burke to
investigate

  thus approximately twenty-four
hours after the affray in thaddeus
harmons penthouse clyde burke had
made a discovery it was burke who
had first noticed the position of the
bookcase in goldy tancreds suite with
this second visit the reporter had de-
tected the change in position

  had goldy tancred known that clyde
burke was an agent of the shadow he
would have taken prompt action to elim-
inate the inquisitive reporter the big
shbt however had taken a different ave-
nue of thought burkes mention of
cardona had led goldy to believe that
the reporter might be working with the
star detective cardona wise and
taciturn was the type of sleuth who
would employ a dictograph in his de-
tecting work

  thus goldy was having burke trailed
to see if the reporter had a connection
with police headquarters at any mo-
ment the big shot could give the word
to dispose of the troublesome news
gatherer but goldy was biding his time
that was his way-a complete mask-
ing of all connection with the under-
world ping slatterly was not the only
gang leader whom the gold-toothed
schemer had at his disposal

  the telephone bell rang after burkes
departure goldy tancred picked up
the receiver and heard the voice of hec-
tor fawcett with the dictograph cov-
ered goldy was free to speak but he
was sparing and cautious in his remarks
he passed off last nights failure as he
stressed the importance of to-morrows
action

  hobbs is ready he will be here

  those were the final words that goldy
tancred heard the big shot hung up
the receiver strolled about and finally
departed from the living room

  it was not long before a creeping
splotch of blackness appeared upon the
floor beside the window once again
the shadow was paying a secret visit to
goldy tancreds abode the black-
ness stretched and wavered above it
materializing beside the curtain ap-
peared the tall phantom form in black

  silently the shadow moved toward
the wall beside the bookcase his sharp
eyes spied the improvised rubber cap
his hidden lips emitted a sibilant whis-
pered laugh

  turning the shadow noted a radi-
ator on the opposite side of the window
ledge going to that spot the shadow
stooped and attached another micro-
phone he ran a thin invisible wire
along the base of the wall then up be-
hind the draped curtain near the book-
case

  wedging the original wire into a
crack beside the window ledge the
shadow connected the new one guiding
his operation by occasional flashes of his
tiny light when he had finished he
stepped back toward the radiator and
spoke in a low hushed voice

  connection completed announced
the shadows monotone burke off duty
until recalled

  those words went to burbank they
were followed by the shadows laugh

  the shadow had come here a second
time to cunningly counteract goldy
tancreds accidental discovery of the
original microphqpe the first connec-
tion was ended goldy confident with
his capping device wutd never suspect
the new installation

  but the shadow by a simple re-
arrangement of the circuit had planted a
new listening apparatus goldy when
he talked would be heard even if the
big shot again went over the line dear
to the apartment below he would not
discover that neat connecting wire that
came in at the crack beside the window
ledge

  nevertheless desired contact had
the shadow magazine



been lost temporarily what had hap-
pened during the interim did any evi-
dence exist that would aid the shadow
in his quest

  the tall figure glided across the room
searching eyes missed no spot that
might furnish a clew the shadows
gaze rested upon the wastebasket the
charred remainders of goldy tancreds
written instructions showed within the
metal container

  a black-gloved hand dipped into the
wastebasket it brought out a tiny frag-
ment of scorched paper the eyes
spotted a portion of a written word the
same hand carefully gathered ashes
while the other hand produced a sheet
of paper

  working upon a convenient table
the shadow laid out these remainders
of goldy tancreds message the ashes
rested upon the shadows sheet the
tiny flashlight clicked a spotted glare
showed traces of writing in the ashes

  the inspection went on amid com-
plete silence at last the hand of the
shadow raised the sheet of paper and
let the fragments of goldys instructions
drift back into the wastebasket the
tall figure swung toward the window
the blank paper that had served as a
background slipped out of sight beneath
the cloak

  a sibilant whispered laugh-scarcely
audible yet it brought eerie- echoes
that was the token of the shadows
departure the phantppi shape merged
with the darkness of the window

  several minutt ter ward curry en-
tered the room the servant noted the
wastebasket and took it out for empty-
ing

  little did curry suppose that a silent
visitor had been in the room to-night
the servant did not realize that his de-
layed action of a simple duty-the
emptying of the wastebasket-had en-
abled a powerful foe of crime to gain
an inkling of goldy tancreds scheme

  for among the ashes in the waste-

basket the shadow had learned broken
facts concerning the next crime on the
schedule there he had read the words
new city-the name of the bank
which ping slatterly was to attack when
the black hush fell again

  amid the next pall of blanketing
darkness the hand of the shadow
would be present how did the master
intend to meet the sinister menace

  only the shadow knew

chapter xiv

at headquarters

  the next night found detective joe
cardona seated at his desk in head-
quarters the star sleuth was going
over a stack of papers which referred
to the interrupted raid on thaddeus
harmons apartment

  reports were barren nothing had
been learned concerning the electrical
equipment of the apartment building

  cardona looked up from his desk as
a man entered he nodded as he caught
sight of detective sergeant markham
the aid who had been working on this
case with him markham took a chair
cardona swung to face him

  any new clews joe questioned
markham

  not a thing responded cardona
gruffly  nothing but a hunch-he
paused to smile-and this hunch is
based upon what happened up at har-
mons

  what is it

  that the same crooks who did those
killings at the olympia were the ones
who raided harmons

  i thought you figured differently
joe you said first that it looked like
one crowd had picked up the idea from
another

  thats what i told the reporters
grinned cardona and i gave them the
idea i had at the time now ive picked
a different slant i havent told any
ne about it yet


the shadow magazine

i youve found something then
no ive found nothing thats
why i have the hunch look at this
markham if one crowd hit the light-
ing system at the olympia to get a
shot at goldy tancred its logical
enough that another would try the same
stunt at harmons thats the first
thought isnt it

  yes

  but the chances are that each outfit
would do the job in its own way thats
true isnt it

  yes

  well argued cardona sagely its
a good bet that wed have got some-
thing on one mob-even if we couldnt
find a clew on the other as it is weve

got nothing therefore-

  i get you interrupted markham
two perfect jobs mean the same
method-and that connects the first with
the second

  right asserted cardona

   it sounds reasonable to me joe de-
clared markham but why havent
they gone after goldy again  that was
their first objective

  ill tell you why said cardona
wagging his forefinger they know
that goldy is smooth theyre afraid
he will get wise to them and demand a
cut to keep mum thats goldys racket
so they went after him first but theyre
afraid to chance it again because hes
laying low

   they figure too that goldy is afraid
of them maybe he is so theyre go-
ing right ahead with a regular schedule
of crime this mess up at harmons
was just the first job on their list
theres others coming

  thats bad joe

  sure its bad thats why im keep-
ing tabs on goldy they may take an-
other shot at him if they do well find
out who they are at the same time
markham im letting the newspapers
hold the old idea it may help fool
these smart crooks

  listen joe said markham sud-
denly youve given me a thought there
i was over by goldys apartment house
last night i saw a reporter coming out
of the place maybe-

  who was he questioned cardona
sharply

  burke the fellow on the classic
returned markham

  clyde burke eh cardonas tone
was analytical say markham hes
been on both of these cases maybe hes
been trying to get goldy tancred to
talk

  not much chance said the detective
sergeant you quizzed goldy he
claimed he told you all he knew-which
wasnt much

  yeah but burke may have some-
thing

  with his final statement cardona
reached for the telephone he called
the classic office he was connected
with clyde burke the detective re-
quested the reporter to come to head-
quarters

  while waiting for burkes arrival
cardona conferred with markham the
detective had another idea and it gained
his aids approval

  im not going to talk too much to
burke explained cardona perhaps
hes looking around for something im
going to let you tail him just to find
out

  clyde burice arrived in cardonas
office with the air of a mcm who ex-
pected information he expressed sur-
prise when the detective began to ques-
tion him

  sure i was up to see goldy as-
serted clyde i thought the same as
you joe maybe goldy would know
who was trying to get him and would
spill it but he was like a clam

  all right burke returned the de-
tective if you run into anything let
me know it would help out a lot if i
could find out who was after goldy
the shadow magazine



  clyde burke departed detective
sergeant markham followed a minute
later when the reporter reached the
street the sleuth was on his trail

  off duty with nothing more im-
portant than a quiet evening at the
classic office clyde burke strolled
along the street totally unconscious of
the fact that he was being tailed by the
detective

  there was also another incident that
clyde failed to notice a prowling fig-
ure was moving up the street ahead
of him he had been followed from
the classic office to headquarters now
the lurker who had trailed him was pre-
ceding him

  detective sergeant markham keep-
ing well in back of the reporter had
no suspicion that a creature of the un-
derworld was moving ahead of the re-
porter yet this odd condition of af-
fairs was due to bring unexpected con-
sequences

  the prowler neared a corner there
he stopped to greet a man who was idly
waiting quick words passed between
the two then as clyde burke ap-
proached the pair began a quick con-
versation the reporter did not hear it
until he had passed he hesitated as
he caught the louder words

  hes going to get goldy eh 

  yeah-im meeting him down at
jerrys-

  a buzz then as clyde paused to
light a cigarette he heard the men-
tion of a street address in a disreputable
neighborhood as he flicked the match
away clyde turned slightly and saw the
backs of the men as they moved along
the street

  clyde burkes decision was a prompt
one like all of the shadows agents
the reporter was expected to use his
own wits in a time of opportunity he
thought no more of the two men he
simply decided to head for the spot that
they had mentioned and see what was
happening there

  as clyde quickened his pace toward
a subway entrance markham also in-
creased speed the detective sergeant
was some distance behind the reporter
he had not observed that clyde had
overheard the conversation between two
chance idlers

  markham simply decided that burke
must have an important destination
tailing a newspaper reporter was a new
experience for the sleuth but under the
present circumstances markham felt
that the trail might lead somewhere

  that had been joe cardonas idea
and the ace detective still held to it
back at his desk in headquarters car-
dona was smoking a cigar while he con-
tinued to pore over the accumulated
data in hope of a new hunch

  at times cardona wondered how
markham might be making out then
his study of the papers before him
occupied his complete attention a half
hour slipped by while the detective
worked the telephone bell rang upon
the desk

  methodically cardona placed papers
aside and picked up the receiver after
the bell had rung thrice he growled
a hello into the mouthpiece a quiet
voice replied cardona listened

  that voice brought back recollections
cardona was sure that he had heard it
before it was not the voice of the
shadow-a strange sinister tone that
cardona had sometimes heard-but the
calmness of this voice brought up
strange connections that concerned the
master of the night

  there was a reason for cardonas im-
pression the ace detective was listen-
ing to the voice of burbank the shad-
ows hidden agent in accordance with
special instructions burbank was tele-
phoning detective headquarters at an
exact time appointed by the shadow

  burbanks voice continued cardo-
nas face turned grim a click came
from the other end of the line cardona
was holding a dead receiver this was


the shadow magazine

not for long the detective slammed
the receiver on the hook and leaped to
his feet he bellowed to men who were
in another office they responded to his
summons

  everybody on this job exclaimed
cardona in a quick but steady voice
were making up a raiding squad we
start inside of five minutes were go-
ing to stop a robbery at the new city
bank

chapter xv

on the elevated

  clyde burke stopped in front of a
dilapidated building he glanced at his
watch illuminating the dial with a
lighted match it was not quite half an
hour since he had left cardonas office

  this was the destination which he
had heard the men give on the street
corner nevertheless clyde was not
sure that he had heard aright when he
had listened to the naming of the loca-
tion he had expected jerrys to be
some meeting spot of the underworld
instead he was viewing the end house
of a quiet row-a structure which was
bounded on one side by an alleyway

  the house looked deserted if it was
it must be the wrong place clyde
looked about then decided that he would
be conspicuous standing here he edged
against the front of the building and
remained near the wall

  as he glanced across the street clyde
thought that he saw another man on the
opposite side of the thoroughfare

  his eyes were right they had
glimpsed the form of detective sergeant
markham but like all quick glances
this one faded under direct surveillance
as clyde watched closely he could see
no further trace of any one

  clyde moved toward the entrance of
the alleyway it was darker there he
decided less chance of being seen when
the men who had talked kept their ren-
dezvous

  it never occurred to the reporter that
he had been lured to this spot that
goldy tancred had given instructions
for henchmen to seize him should he
pay a visit to detective headquarters

  joe cardonas telephone call had actu-
ally been an unwitting death warrant for
clyde burke the reporter in turn
had made two serious blunders the
first had been his folly in believing that
two gangsters would talk over plans so
close to detective headquarters the
second had been his failure to call bur-
bank

  had clyde been on duty for the
shadow he would have communicated
with the contact man but since he was
a free agent for the night clyde had
gone out on his own iti so doing he
had deliberately placed himself beyond
the sphere of the shadows protection
-a mistake which no agent of the
shadow should have committed

  despite his ommissions however the
reporter did manage to gain a slight
inkling of danger as he neared the en-
trance of the alleyway clyde was
unarmed to-night and he tightened his
fists as he gained the instinctive thought
of some trouble in this abandoned neigh-
borhood

  thus clyde was not totally unpre-
pared when danger did strike more-
over those who carried the threat be-
trayed themselves an instant too soon
just as clyde moved slowly into the
darkness at the side of the building he
caught a sound just ahead of him he
stepped back as he raised his hands

  a man sprang forward from the
darkness a swift arm came down-
ward as it swung a blackjack clyde
did not see the blow but he anticipated
it swinging his own arm upward the
reporter deflected the stroke the mans
form fell upon him and clyde shot out
to the sidewalk as he locked in a quick
struggle

  this was just the beginning three
                    shad-a
the shadow magazine



a man sprang forward  
arm swung a blackjack

a swift

men more scrambled from the darkness
and leaped forward to the fray fully
engaged with his one antagonist clyde
burke would have fared ill but for the
presence of detective sergeant mark-
ham across the street

  the sound of the attack the sight of
dim forms hurtling to the sidewallc-
these told markham that burke had met
with unexpected foemen the sleuth
pulled his revolver and fired at the
front of the building above the heads


the shadow magazine

of the men who had emerged from the
alleyway

  the effect was instantaneous fig-
ures scattered the man who was fight-
ing clyde burke wriggled free and
dived for the shelter of the alleyway

  markham fired again dodging the
gangsters drew their own revolvers and
returned the shots

  clyde burke prone upon the side-
walk rolled toward the house and
crouched in the shelter of some stone
steps the move was just in time
gangster bullets spattered at the spot
where the reporter had been the mob-
sters were making a last effort to riddle
their quarry whom they had been or-
dered to kill

  had markham weakened in his sur-
prise attack the gunmen would have
put up a resistance the detective ser-
geant however was a cool hand in the
midst of battle he held an advantage
in that he could see all of his foemen
except the blackjack artist who had scur-
ried for the alleyway

  markhams shots zipped dangerously
close to the scattered attackers one
bullet winged a gangsters shoulder and
the wounded mans cry brought con-
sternation to the rest these rats were
merely paid assassins not gorillas of a
doughty caliber

  as the wounded man fled clutching
his shoulder the others followed suit
markham sent two shots down the alley-
way as a parting thrust to the man
who had disappeared in that direction
then coming from his position of
vantage the detective sergeant hurried
across the street and reached the place
where clyde burke was huddled

  all right burke growled mark-
ham

  clyde recognized the voice and re-
sponded as he arose from beside the
steps

  that you markham he asked
say-i didnt know you were tailing
me thanks old fellow

  lucky i did tail you said mark-
ham gruffly as he began to reload his re-
volver got yourself into a pickle
didnt you what was the idea
listened in on what some gang boys
had to say replied clyde calmly
heard them talking about a get-
together in this neighborhood thought
id find out what it was about

  fine idea snorted markham
well you nearly found out too much
come along the guns loaded up again
im going to call joe cardona burke
maybe hell want to talk to you after
this

  suits me responded clyde in an
indifferent tone i was just after a
story-thats all

  they reached a small store a block
away from the spot of the short fray
markham entered a telephone booth
burke watched the detective sergeant
phoning he saw an excited look ap-
pear upon markhams countenance

  hanging up the receiver markham
plunged from the booth and gripped
clyde burkes arm without a word
he led the reporter hastily along the
street they came to an elevated sta-
tion and the detective sergeant hurriedly
ascended the steps with clyde still in
tow

  the pair entered a train the car
was almost empty markham thrust
clyde in a corner seat and gave a low
grim laugh

  whats up panted clyde still
winded from the mad rush where
are you dragging me markham
plenty is up retorted the detective
sergeant in a confidential whisper im
taking you where you want to go-to a
place where youll get a good story

  the accent on the word good
caught clydes ear he looked at mark-
ham for further information the de-
tective sergeant gave it with a grin

  started to tell cardona i had you
with me he remarked before i
the shadow magazine



could tell him what had happened he
gave me new instructions he was just
leaving with a raiding squad were
going to join them-at least i am you
can hang back and watch

  where questioned clyde eagerly

  straight up sixth avenue returned
markham its the new city bank
burke somebodys going to try to
crack it to-night

  whew exclaimed clyde

  the ejaculation masked the sudden
thought that had occurred to the re-
porter was the hand of the shadow
connected with this tip-off the mys-
terious master of the night had warned
cardona of other contemplated crimes
in the past

  only one station more the train
was rumbling rapidly along the ele-
vated platform clyde could see that
markham was eager to join with the
raiders even though the man was main-
taining a calm expression

  then came blackness

  without warning every light in the
elevated train was extinguished the
cars slid to a grinding stop halted
midway between stations they rested
amid a strange silence that fell from
nowhere

  neither clyde burke nor detective
sergeant markham understood the sig-
nificance of that sudden appalling
gloom they did not realize that the
mysterious power of the black hush had
once again been projected upon a desig-
nated spot in the midst of teeming man-
hattan 

  that was a fact that only the shadow
knew

chapter xvi

out of the vault

  the same pall that had stopped the
train on the sixth avenue elevated had
accomplished another purpose it had
cast its strange blackness upon the pol-
ished face of the low-storied new city
bank

  as completely as if an invisible hand
had stretched forth to wipe it away the
white marble front of the strong-walled
edifice had been blanked into oblivion
by a powerful ray of superdarkness

  joe cardona and his raiding squad
had not arrived in this locality while
they were still hurrying to the spot the
first stroke had come amid a bar-
rage of total gloom men of crime were
advancing to attack the vault of the
blotted bank

  a tremendous hush lay over this one
low building it formed perfect cov-
erage for the unseen men who were
moving up to the side of the new city
bank

  the attack had been well planned
without a single ray of light to aid
them the invaders stopped at a side door
of the building quick hands went to
work while ping slatterly gave muf-
fled commands

  zoom

  an explosion made the side of the
bank building tremble but even that
blast which blew the door clear of its
fastenings was no more than a low
rumble tbe blanketing effect of the
hush seemed to stifle all sounds within
its enveloping folds

  mobsmen pressed forward they
were entering a building equipped with
all the most modern of alarm devices
but to-night they did not fear these
mechanical sentinels every electrical
apparatus in the entire bank had gone
out of order when the black hush had
struck

  watchmen 

  they were powerless too telephonic
communication was ended flashlights
and powerful electric lanterns would not
avail ping slatterly thought of that
fact with relish as he ignited the strong
acetylene torch which was to play so im-
portant a part in this raid

  immune from interference the strong
gleam lighted up the interior of the
bank a watchman scurried away as


the shadow magazine

gangster shots were directed toward
him with his men forming a pro-
tecting cordon to meet stray shots from
the darkness ping slatterly headed for
the vault which he had come to crack

 this stroke of crime had been
planned long before the first test of the
black hush slattcrlys men obeying or-
ders were at all strategic spots let the
watchmen move around helpless if
they tried to make trouble that would
be their end they could not leave the
building for gangsters were picking
their way to the various doors all
means of communication from within
the bank were ended

  the acetylene light shone upon the
vault ping lowered the gleam so that
his safe-blowers could prepare this
would be a job as quick as the one at
the outside door

  the gang leader gave a muffled laugh
the outside explosion could not have
been heard very far away due to the
sound-stilling gloom this blast would
not be heard at all it required a larger
charge but the walls of the bank would
aid the black hush in its silencing
power

  ready

  pings voice had a hushed sound in
the midst of that strange scene where
even the downward-turned gleam of the
lantern was forced to penetrate a murky
haze

  growls of assent were the reply to
pings question the men moved for-
ward ping slatterly turned his lan-
tern up to the big door of the vault
an audible gasp escaped the mob lead-
ers thick lips

  impelled by a power from within the
door of the vault was swinging open
as it moved wide from the interior
came a glare as forceful as the one
from the lantern which ping slatterly
carried

  some being from within the vault
was meeting the rays of the acetylene

lantern with another illuminating device
of the same type

  ping slatterly could not see the per-
son behind that light but the other could
see him for the light within the vault
was focused with even greater power

  moreover the strange unexpected
intruder was able to observe pings gang
of followers in the misty illumination
every one of the invaders was in plain
view

  the light was astonishing in itself
blinding it came as a terrific counter-
agent to ping slatterlys first weapon of
attack but another token of a formida-
ble presence within the vault brought
dread consternation to the gang leader
and all his band of ruffians

  from the hollow interior of the vault
came a sound that no man of the un-
derworld could fail to recognize it
was a laugh that broke with rising
echoes-a sinister burst of derisive
mirth that seemed to shatter the spell of
the black hush

  the laugh of the shadow

  cognizant of the plans to raid the
new city bank knowing the hour for
which the attack had been arranged the
shadow had entered this building long
before-while the bank had still been
open

  keeping in seclusion he had man-
aged to elude discovery by the watch-
men familiar with every ingenious
contrivance of vault protection the
shadow had worked upon that massive
door and had opened it without detec-
tion he had chosen it as the vital
spot from which he could strike against
the crooks when they appeared

  the shadows method had proven its
worth he was here to meet the enemy
he had caught ping slatterly and his
gangsters flat-footed

  the opening of the door the appear-
ance of the powerful light the mighty
laugh of the shadow-these acts of
gangdoms greatest enemy had been
timed to exactitude -
the shadow magazine



  meanwhile unknown to ping slat-
terly and his henchmen forces of the
law were coming to this beleaguered
spot the shadows purpose was to
meet the crooks with a surprise attack
and drive them in flight into the toils of
joe cardona

  an amazing scene-this meeting be-
tween the shadow and the hosts of
crime while that ringing laugh hurtled
from the vault the gang leader and his
men stood like petrified figures-unmov-
ing characters in a sordid tableau

  so had the shadow planned now
he acted with full precision a shot
burst from the vault like the first
stroke which the shadow had deliv-
ered at thaddeus harmons penthouse
this one was again directed at the acety-
lene lantern in ping slatterlys hand

  the bullet reached its gleaming tar-
get pings lantern was shattered the
gang leader dropped back unwounded
by the deflected bullet

  revolver in hand he cried to his men
to reply in kind the shadows lantern
made a shining bulls-eye behind it
was the shadow himself

  so ping slatterly had reasoned the
gang leader however had not reck-
oned with the wisdom of the shadow

  that lantern was not in the shad-
ows hand it was propped upon a
stack of boxes in the vault below it
prone upon the floor lay the shadow
his form was protected by a raised
ledge of steel that ran along the bottom
of the vault at the very front

  as ping slatterly pressed finger to re-
volver trigger the shadows automatic
roared loosing his powerful s the
shadow directed one squarely toward
ping slatterly while the other began a
sweeping motion about the semicircle
of mobsmen

  ping slatterly fell an oath upon his
lips the sight of their leader drop-
ping the spatter of bullets aimed in
their direction-these were tokens that
threw the mobsmen into confusion one

gangster paused to fire at the lantern
in the vault his shot went wide he
never dispatched another like ping
slatterly he crumpled as an automatic
roared

  the other mobsmen were scrambling
to shelter they dashed for the protec-
tion of marble walls seeking to avoid
the glare that outlined them the shad-
ows shots quick as a warning were
intermittent as the gunmen fled

  the shadow knew where they would
go-out through the broken door-into
the forces of the law that awaited them
there his task was to deal first with
those who attempted resistance to his
might

  ping slatterly-a second mobster-
these had fallen a third turning to
crouch on the verge of the area of light
fell wounded as a bullet from an auto-
matic shattered his revolver arm the
man screamed as he dived after his
companions his hoarse cry was
strangely suppressed by the blanketing
hush

  again came the laugh of the
shadow this master fighter who
struck from darkness had beaten back
the invaders by his irresistible might
not one shot had reached that glowing
lantern which gave the shadow his
advantage over his enemies he had
beaten a dozen and more men of crime
to the first shots

  as the last of the defeated invaders
fled from the room where ping slat-
terly lay before the opened vault the
shadow arose from his place of protec-
tion the light moved forward as he
gripped it the door of the vault swung
shut

  the shadows ambush had succeeded
now with one automatic in his hidden
right hand-a fresh weapon which had
come from beneath his cloak-the
shadow moved forward in steady pur-
suit of the fleeing mobsmen

  the glaring acetylene headlight cut a


the shadow magazine

misty swath through the smudgy
gloom its penetrating rays reaching
every cranny were seen by the last of
the fleeing mobsmen now well ahead in
the darkness

  the moving threat impelled every de-
parting rat to scurry to the only exit
that seemed to offer safety-that opened
door which ping slatterly had so boldly
blasted from its mighty hinges

  watchmen saved from destruction
still cowered in spots of safety they
did not know what had happened they
like the fleeing mobsmen also avoided
the acetylene glare then with the same
suddenness with which it had appeared
the shadows light went out

  a triumphant laugh stirred up feeble
echoes amid the awesome atmosphere
of the black hush the final whispers
died away the shadow lurking in the
gloom was planning his secret de-
parture timing it with the confusion
which was due to break outside of the
bank when the mobsters met the police

  single-handed the shadow had
brought disaster to these fiends of crime
amid the pall which they had sought
once again the perpetrators of the
black hush had been foiled

chapter xvii

the power of the ray

  from the window high in the judruth
tower hector fawcett was again view-
ing the awesome ray that symbolized the
hidden power of the black hush

  bathed in darkness the front of the
new city bank was a blank space
among a mass of looming buildings it
was toward that single spot that hector
fawcett was looking in his intentness
the bespectacled man did not notice that
the elevated trains were stopped above
sixth avenue

  times nearly up informed faw-
cett

good came the voice of hobbs

  why questioned fawcett

  because of the elevated was the
reply the trains are stopped it
couldnt be helped

  hector fawcett laughed he was sure
that this phenomenon would add nothing
to police investigations he was think-
ing only of what was going on within
the bank

  from the tower nothing could be
seen nor heard the explosions and the
glare of acetylene lights were completely
obscured by the long shaft of blackness
that extended down to walls of the new
city bank

  the roar of the city was audible but
every sound that reached the heights of
the ninety-third floor came from some
spot outside the black-rayed area the
scientific shroud was all-suppressing in
its power

  one spot other than the bank build-
ing had attracted fawcetts attention
during this period of sustained black-
ness in back of the bank and to one
side the stout man could see an empty
lot-one of those few portions of man-
hattan that was temporarily free from
occupation or building operation

  fawcett had watched this area because
its edge marked the limit of the black
ray in fact the outer arc of the arti-
ficial darkness lay like a peculiar shadow
from the bank building as a contrast
the light of an electric sign cast a vivid
glow upon the rest of the vacant spot
it was a strange phenomenon of dark-
ness versus strong illumination

  even from the towering height faw-
cett could distinguish objects in that
space he suddenly noticed an automo-
bile moving from the darkness into the
light that was surprising until the
rear of the car appeared then fawcett
saw the pygmy forms of half a dozen
men scrambling into the car

  evidently the black ray had stalled the
automobile fawcett chuckled these
chaps would not know the difference
the car was starting now but as it
jostled along an alleyway and headed
the shadow magazine



down a side street fawcett was sur-
prised at the reckless speed with which it
headed for an avenue

  then he caught a flash of a car swing-
ing in from another direction he re-
alized that a pursuit was on he was
just about to mention the fact when
hobbs spoke

  how about the time

  its up exclaimed fawcett glanc-
ing at his watch turn off the ray
hobbs responded his hand pressed
the switch released from black bond-
age the front of the new city bank
gleamed anew tiny trains began to
move along the sixth avenue elevated

  in the dwarfed cross section of man-
hattan which was suddenly restored to
light hector fawcett beheld odd signs
of activity he caught glimpses of tiny
figures beside the bank building he saw
automobiles spurt forward a sud-
den connection came to his mind

  the police are there  he exclaimed
to hobbs those men who fled were
our workers up the avenue-beyond

the bank building-

  the man at the black-ray machine
made no comment clicks indicated
work that he was doing the dark-
faced projector was turning its front
surface was undergoing adjustment
there they are v cried fawcett

  in the gloom of the room the bespec-
tacled man tried to point out a car that
was speeding along the avenue he saw
it at one cross street immediately in
back of it were pursuing vehicles that
flashed into view fawcett thought that
he could glimpse tiny figures about to
wage battle

  the car turned it took a side street
and suddenly swung into an avenue that
led almost beneath the judruth tower

  the situation was plain now the flee-
ing car was closely followed fawcett
could see men on the running boards of
police cars firing as they chased

   click i

  the black ray was on again now its
beam was slender tapering out to a
comparatively small circle focused al-
most directly downward hobbs threw
the shaft directly into the avenue behind
the carload of escaping gangsters

  the pursuers shot into the gloom
their cars did not reappear hobbs
wavered the circle slowly forward tak-
ing account of the momentum which the
cars had acquired hector fawcett
laughed

  the new maneuver had paralyzed the
pursuing police their cars were
blotted out by darkness motors stalled
lights gone the chase could not be con-
tinued 

  the fleeing gangsters were gaining
blocks but a new menace to their flight
had now appeared they were coming
to an important crossing swinging in
behind from side streets were new pur-
suers and from both directions on the
wide cross street other cars were con-
verging 

  it was too late now fawcett ut-
tered an oath-for he fancied that more
than men was in those cars he did
not know that the fleeing gangsters had
failed to make their haul from the
coffers of the new city bank

  the mobsters would be captured
surely fawcett thought for cars were
closing in ahead and from the rear he
expected hobbs to widen the ray to
blanket the entire area with blackness
that the fleeing men might leave the car
and run

  fawcett added a groan to his oath as
he saw that the clear avenue traffic was
about to be interrupted by the crosstown
flow total darkness would be the only
resort now

  hobbs did the unexpected the circle
of his ray swpt forward with amazing
speed a veritable lever wielded from a
distance of a thousand feet it freed the
stranded police cars that were now far
behind it stopped suddenly upon the


the shadow magazine

important intersection toward which the
gangster car was fleeing

   spreading the ray caught the cross
traffic just as it was starting no block-
ing car could reach the intersection

   it was a perfect maneuver but faw-
cett feared that it was futile the po-
lice were stopped on the cross street
but the fleeing car was heading directly
into the black circle with a trio of pur-
suers gaining on it less than a half a
block behind these new chasers had
come in from side streets

   click

   just as the gangster car reached the
edge of the black circle the huge spot
disappeared traveling at a mile-a-min-
ute clip the fleeing automobile shot
across the cleared intersection

   click

   hobbs resumed the ray clear of the
further arc the escaping car kept oji-
but the intersection was again bathed in
blackness which enveloped the police
cars as they came into the iange

   great work great work cried
fawcett keep them there they
cant follow now

   not too long decided hobbs

  the gangsters had gained half a
dozen blocks both watchers saw the
car swerve into a side street

   hobbs pressed the switch the black
hush was ended at the intersection it
had been a matter of broken minutes
the police chase had begun anew but
now the law would have to guess which
direction the escaped gangsters had dis-
appeared

   the shadow had won his fight to-
night he had driven back a horde of
criminals he had defeated the scheme
of cunning brains a handful of the
thwarted raiders had escaped but that
fact marked an empty attainment for
those who wielded the strange black ray

   it was the belief that fing slatterly
was fleeing with a mass of stolen wealth
that had caused hector fawcetts anxi-
ety to aid the speeding gangsters had

fawcett known that those in flight were
traveling empty-handed without the
leader he would have ordered hobbs to
let them fall into the hands of the po-
lice

   ping slatterly was the only one who
counted he alone had controlled his
henchmen none of the underlings
possessed an inkling regarding the
source of the black hush pings con-
tact with goldy tancred had been
guarded even from his own men

  thus the shadow by his strategy
had not only thwarted the power of the
black hush he had also caused the
hidden malefactors-fawcett and
hobbs-to take drastic action which had
not been contemplated

   with their moving barrage of black-
ness the men in the judruth tower had
revealed new clews which would serve
the shadow well in his unceasing ef-
forts to learn the source of the weird
black hush

  the power of the ray had been
demonstrated in a new way but it had
gained nothing for the men behind it

chapter xviii

  facts for the shadow

   at noon the following day a young
man appeared in the outer office of rut-
ledge manns suite the stenographer
recognized the visitor she entered the
inner office and announced that mr
vincent was calling

   mann ordered the girl to tell vincent
to enter

  seated by manns desk the door of
the office closed harry vincent quietly
waited for the investment broker to
finish operations with a stack of clip-
pings that lay upon the desk

   there was a marked contrast between
these two men who served as agents to
the shadow

  harry vincent active agent was a
virile active young man whose face
showed keen determination cool in
the shadow magazine



the face of danger persistent in any
task set for him harry had proven his
ability as a dependable roving operative

  rutledge mann passive agent was a
roly-poly sort of chap who preferred the
comfort of his office his ability lay in
his attention to detail methodical and
exact mann was well equipped to per-
form the work required of him

   this had not been the first conference
between the two while the shadow
had been battling against the crooks who
worked with the black hush rutledge
mann and harry vincent had been co-
operating in an effort to gain informa-
tion that concerned richard reardon
and roland furness the electrical en-
gineeers slain at the olympia hotel

  to date they had made progress
rutledge mann by methodical research
had learned a pointed fact concerning
the past of roland furness in his
senior year at college furness had been
expelled with his roommate don chal-
vers the young men had completed
their education at another institution

  the cause of the expulsion mann had
discovered was due to repeated experi-
ments in which the roommates had in-
dulged on several occasions they had
thrown the electrical equipment of the
dormitories into disrepair this had
led the college authorities to request
them to continue their studies at an-
other institution

  roland furness was dead he had
met his end amid a strange blackness
which was significant for it linked his
demise with his expulsion from college

  rutledge mann had forwarded these
facts to the shadow he had been
ordered to locate don chalvers

  this had proven difficult mann had
learned that chalvers owned a small
isolated estate in the foothills of the
catskill mountains independent be-
cause of a legacy the young engineer
preferred travel to seclusion in his home
among the wooded hills

  aided by harry vincents efforts

mann had traced chalvers to new york
city the whereabouts of don chal-
vers had been left for harry to learn
it was concerning this matter that harry
had come to manns office to-day the
investment broker was sure that the
active agent had gained new informa-
tion this proved to be the case

  ive located him announced harry
when mann had put his clippings aside

  you mean chalvers returned
mann voicing his words as an agree-
ment

  yes asserted harry he has an
apartment on fifty-fourth street hes
there occasionally and i caught up with
him at a broadway night club-harry
smiled-at two oclock this morning

  what then 

  i introduced myself made friends
pretended to have met him before
helped him get home to his apartment
im due to drop in there this evening

  good approved mann youll be
at the metrolite

  harry vincent nodded the refer-
ence was to his hotel it meant that
rutledge mann intended to forward this
new information to the shadow then
to await exact orders regarding harrys
appointment

  methodical rutledge mann required
precise descriptive data pertaining to
don chalvers gazing thoughtfully at
harry vincent the investment broker
put forward careful questions

  what reaction did chalvers show
when you introduced yourself asked
mann

  he seemed a bit surprised de-
clared harry then he became very
friendly

  did he take your word for it that
you were an old acquaintance

  yes after a short befuddlement
he felt sure that he remembered me
he remarked that he had been many
places and had met many people he
said that he could remember faces but
not names


the shadow magazine

  where did you say that you had met
him 

  in bermuda our data showed that
he had made several trips there

  your visit to-night observed mann
thoughtfully do you think that it will
bring up any complications

  not a chance laughed harry it
will be a get-acquainted affair my only
hope is that chalvers will mention fur-
ness they were roommates at college
and close friends after that

  all right decided mann ill call
you later at the metrolite

  when harry vincent had left rut-
ledge mann made inked notations and
sealed them in an envelope he turned
to his clippings and began a final ar-
rangement

  to-days news stories told of the po-
lice rescue at the new city bank led
by the intrepid joe cardona a squad of
policemen and detectives had arrived in
time to prevent the cracking of the
vault

  they had driven back several of the
mobsters who were confused amid the
darkness the restoration of light had
caught these lawless men just within
the side door of the bank cardona
leading the advance had opened fire

  by force of superior numbers the
officers had quickly won the engage-
ment among dead and wounded mob-
sters who had staggered in all directions
the police had discovered one slain man
whom they were sure had headed the
expedition

  this was ping slatterly

  the fact that the electrical equipment
of the new city bank had been put out
of order was an important item in the
story the newspapers also stressed the
fact that some marauders had man-
aged to extinguish the street lights at an
important intersection thus enabling the
mobsters to escape

  in the rapidity of events at that point
the drivers of pursuing cars had scarcely

realized the import of the other un-
usual phenomena which had occurred
they spoke of stalled cars of extin-
guished headlights of blanketing gloom
but there was much that they made no
effort to explain

  it was known now however that
some peculiar form of electrical dis-
turbing power had been utilized but the
newspapers ringing with the reports of
how the major criminals had been
caught gave little attention to the details
of the unsuccessful pursuit

  joe cardona was the hero inasmuch
as he had been at the bank itself the
ace detective was naturally concerned
with the success of the police raid he
stated emphatically that the death of
ping slatterly must mark the end of
these odd crimes which had involved the
extinguishing of lights in buildings

  another item went into manns en-
velope this pertained to a tie-up on
the sixth avenue elevated which had
occurred on the preceding evening
newspapers had not connected this with
the foiled bank robbery but along
with his clippings mann inclosed a
statement from clyde burke

  the quick-witted reporter had gained
a theory which he had not mentioned at
the classic office traveling with de-
tective sergeant markham almost at the
spot where the bank had been attacked
clyde was sure that the ended service on
the elevated line possessed a definite sig-
nificance

  rutledge mann sealed the envelope
and left his office he told the stenog-
rapher that he would return after lunch
on the street the investment broker
took a taxicab to twenty-third street

  entering the old dilapidated building
mann ascended to the blind office which
bore the name of the mythical jonas
he returned to the street and continued
on to his club for luncheon

  it was later in the afternoon when
rutledge mann back in his office re-
ceived a letter which had been thrust
the shadow magazine



through the mail chute he opened the
missive after the stenographer had
brought it to him inked coded words
disappeared following the insurance
brokers perusal

  rutledge mann smiled wanly as he
picked up the telephone and called the
metrolite hotel

  instructions had arrived from the
shadow harry vincent was to visit
don chajvers to-night

chapter xix

goldy employs strategy

  call for you burke

  clyde burke arose from his type-
writer in the classic office at the tele-
phone he recognized the steady voice of
detective joe cardona

teen minutes

  no cardonas voice came over the
wire in terse monosyllables he sent
for us

  leaving the classic office burke
stopped at a telephone booth on the
ground floor he called burbank to
inform him of this new development
he arranged to call again as soon as he
had learned why goldy tancred had
summoned joe cardona

  in the lobby of the marathon clyde
found cardona and markham waiting
for him the trio took the elevator

  curry received them at the door of
goldy tancreds apartment seeing
clyde burke the servant hesitated

  its all right announced cardona
gruffly this fellow is with me come
along men

ignoring currys indecision the de-

tective pressed forward followed by his
companiens the three found goldy
tancred garbed in dressing gowsi pac-
ing the floor of his living room goldy
was quizzical when he saw clyde burke

  i want to talk to you cardona
he began what ive got to say is pri-
vate i dont want it to leak out too
soon

  burkes al right growled the de-
tective hes not reporting to-night

  goldy tancred hesitated then he
shrugged his shoulders he smiled
weakly as he pointed to chairs then
with teeth still gleaming he dropped into
his own lounging seat

  joe announced the big shot im
worried youve put me in a real mess
its up to you to give me a chance to
get out of it

  hows that questioned cardona

  cardona was astounded for a mo-
ment  then he began to nod busy with
details after last nights episode the ace
detective had forgotten all about goldy
tancred now he saw the obvious con-
nection

  he bumped those engineers as-
serted goldy in a confident tone he

i wanted to talk with you how did
you get wise in time to spoil pings
game who gave you the tip-off
thats my business declared car-
dona

  thats just it responded goldy
thats just why theres trouble for me
theres plenty of tough bimboes won-
dering where that tip-off came from
theres plenty who figure that ping
slatterly was after me putting two
and two together theyll think that i
was the guy who told you to watch ping
slatterly

  cardona was silent he saw the logic
of goldys statement if ping slat-
terly was not the only powerful gang
leader concerned in the attack upon the
new city bank his companions would
certainly be out to avenge his death
cardona began a new chain of conjec-
ture

  youve given me something to think
about said the detective after long
consideration ill tell you why i
brought burke up here goldy last
night he ran into a couple of thugs who
would have got him if markham hadnt
been there burke had been up to see
you hadnt he 

  sure retorted goldy he was
here twice

  well resumed cardona i didnt
like the looks of it i brought him here
so we could hear what you have to say
about it

  about him coming up to see me
no about this attempt to gang
him

  you want to hear what i have to
say cried goldy ive said it al-
ready-if you could only see the facts
like i see them

  look here cardona ping slatterly
was pulling a job last night he didnt
want me to know about it chances are

hes had guys watching this place like a
hawk

  burke here-goldy pointed to the
reporter-came in to see me outside
of bowser riggins hes the only visitor
ive had cant you see it now joe
those bimboes ganged burke because
they thought he was working for me
they were some of ping slatterlys mob
thats easy to see

  cardona speculated once again the
detective found himself agreeing with
goldy tancreds statement he nodded
automatically and spoke a slow ques-
tion

  what do you want me to do about
it goldy asked cardona how can
i help you out of the jam got any sug-
gestions

  goldys fancy molars glimmered the
big shot studied the detective with an
expression that was almost one of deri-
sion cardona wondered what the cause
might be

  you want to help me sneered
goldy then why have you double-
crossed me joe why did you plant a
mike here in this room

  i planted nothing retorted cardona
hotly

  no goldy strode across the room
as he spoke he beckoned to the others
as he thrust back the bookcase look
at this didnt you put it here

  cardona viewed the microphone after
goldy removed the rubber cap the de-
tective shook his head

  i dont know a thing about it
goldy he asserted in a frank tone
positively i dont

  the big shot grunted he yanked the
microphone from the wall and began to
tear away the wire it broke in his
hand as he came to the spot where the
slender line reached the window ledge
reaching beyond the broken point
goldy gave another yank

  it produced unexpected results out
came the wiring from below the window
the shadow magazine



ledge pulling away in sudden con-
sternation goldy followed the opposite
direction and the microphone behind
the radiator snapped suddenly into view

  two of them exclaimed the big
shot say-what is this dont you
know anything about it joe

  not a thing insisted cardona

maybe when we trace the line-

  nothing doing interposed goldy
it runs to a telephone in an empty
apartment below no way of tracing it
after that

  in sudden rage goldy seized both
microphones and dashed the instru-
ments against the wall he began to
tremble his smile became a pitiful ex-
pression clasping his temples with
his hands goldy tancred stalked to his
chair and slumped into the cushions

  theyre after me joe he gasped
theyre after me i figured you rigged
up the dictograph layout but if you
didnt-say-theyve been right here-
right where they could get me i ive
got to get out of this joe

  goldy tancreds surprising collapse
impressed joe cardona the detective
pondered

  by now he was convinced that ping
slatterly and others-probably rack-
eteers whom goldy had bearded in the
past-had plotted well to put the gold-
toothed big shot on the spot

  the death of ping slatterly the
crime which had been attempted in
strange darkness the ganging of clyde
burke the discovery of the dictograph
connection-all these were proofs that
goldy tancred was in great danger

  cardona had little sympathy for this
high-stepping racketeer at the same
time the detective saw goldy tancred
as nothing more than a prospective vic-
tim of the underworlds wrath it was
cardonas business to prevent murder
he could not ignore goldys plea

  you want police protection de-
manded the detective

  goldy shook his bowed head

  what then  questioned cardona
let me get out of this requested
goldy stick with me joe i want
a chance to scram i can go where they
wont ever find me

  joe cardona pondered he still felt
that so far as crime was concerned ping
slatterlys death marked the end of the
recent series of outrages goldy tan-
cred was of no value as a witness

  there were good reasons also why
cardona would like to see goldy tan-
cred out of new york the man had
unquestionably worked for political con-
nections he was a conniver who could
cause great trouble in manhattan

  all right goldy mused cardona
ill let you beat it if youll let me

make sure youve gone-

  let you make sure exclaimed
goldy say-joe-i want you to
cover me

  how

  ill duck out of here up to the
pennsylvania station-to-night train
for florida if i get on that without
anybody knowing it ill be safe send
a man along-ill pay the round-trip
expenses

  but i want you to cover me from
here to the station follow my cab
see me buy my ticket send me off
thats all i ask joe im licked i
want to get away

  cardona smiled disdainfully the big
shot was proving yellow the myth that
goldy tancred was a power no longer
existed the bubble had burst

  all right agreed the detective
well cover you markham and i will
travel along behind you buy two tick-
ets and ill have a man waiting at the
gate to join you

  thanks joe gasped goldy in
blurted appreciation youre a real
scout im trusting you joe-you too
burke dont let this out until im
away please

  ill hold it agreed clyde


the shadow magazine

  wait down in the lobby suggested
goldy make sure that nobodys lay-
ing for me there ill get dressed-i
wont even take a bag with me theres
a train that i can make just an hour
from now when i come down fol-
low me 

  all right agreed cardona

  the detective turned and motioned
to markham and burke the three
walked out of the living room where
curry met them and showed them to the
elevator

  the last glance that clyde burke had
through the closing door was a picture
of goldy tancred nervously clasping
his hands as he sat worried in his big
chair the reporter smiled as he heard
cardona laugh

  a big yellow bum was the detec-
tives sarcastic comment goldy tan-
cred-yellow as they make them

  the ace detective would have changed
his opinion could he have seen through
the closed door of the apartment back
in his living room goldy tancred was
no longer a figure of dejection

  a cunning flashy smile had replaced
the pitiful expression on the big shots
lips standing in the center of his liv-
ing room goldy tancred was enjoying
a laugh of silent derision

  his servant entered goldys laugh
changed to a low command which
brought a knowing smile from curry

  all right curry instructed goldy
rig up that funny mug of yours slide
into the outfit and be quick about it

  curry went to a table in the corner
he opened a drawer and brought out
several tiny glimmering objects he
slipped them into his mouth adjusted
them and turned to smile at his chief

  his teeth capped with gold shells
curry had gained a grin that was an ex-
act replica of goldy tancreds favorite
expression even without make-up the
servant bore a startling resemblance to
his master

  thats great goldy tancred
nodded keep going curry hope
you enjoy the climate in florida

chapter xx

the departure

  down in the lobby of the hotel
marathon clyde burke remarked to
joe cardona that he would have to put
in a call to the classic office

  dont say anything about this
warned the detective ive promised
goldy-

  not a word about it returned
clyde

  in a telephone booth the reporter
called burbank as the shadows agent
he gave a terse account of the happen-
ings in goldy tancreds apartment

  burbank had already heard the con-
versation up to goldys plea for aid in
his flight then the dictograph connec-
tion had been broken when goldy had
torn the microphones from the wall

  report received was burbanks
comment

  that meant that word would be given
to the shadow clyde burke left the
booth and returned to find cardona and
markham in a low-voiced discussion

  goldy has probably ditched bowser
riggins cardona was saying maybe
that bird has flown south already its
easier to scram one at a time than two
together

  maybe bowser is still sticking
around objected markham letting
himself be watched until goldys in the
clear

  the sleuths dropped the discussion as
being of no consequence it developed
that cardona had also made a call while
clyde burke was phoning an unim-
portant man from headquarters had
been designated to meet goldy at the
station gate and accompany him aboard
the train

  markham was watching the elevator
steadily after a quarter hour of wait-

v
the shadow magazine



ing the detective sergeant spoke to his
companions

  here comes goldy now

  a stocky form was emerging from the
elevator the man was wearing a heavy
overcoat the collar was raised about
his chin a gray hat pressed down upon
the mans forehead

  as the man walked through the lobby
his gleaming grin showed between the
peaks of the overcoat collar the watch-
ing men caught that characteristic ex-
pression that so plainly denoted goldy
tancred

  the man went out through the lobby
door the detectives and the reporter
follawed they saw the supposed goldy
enter a taxicab and drive away car-
dona hailed another vehicle and the trio
followed

  it was a slow ride to the pennsyl-
vania station there was ample time
however for goldy tancred to make
his train cardona markham and
burke continued behind the man who
was seeking flight

  they saw him stop at the informa-
tion booth then at a ticket window and
finally head for the train gates mov-
ing rapidly ahead cardona approached
the gate and signaled to a man who was
standing there as goldy tancreds
double arrived the man joined him

  this was cardonas subordinate-a
young detective who had never seen
goldy tancred but who could be easily
trusted to keep tabs upon the man who
was pointed out to him

  cardona caught goldy tancreds
familiar grin as the supposed big shot
thrust a ticket into the hand of the
waiting sleuth the pair walked down
the steps together cardona turned to
rejoin his companions

  thats that laughed cardona the
big shot is small fry now goldy tan-
cred has scrammed for the everglades
itll take more than his gold teeth to
laugh off that one

  the detective pronounced this state-
ment with the positive assurance that
he had seen goldy tancred take the
limited for florida with his own man
on the same train cardona had no
doubt regarding the completion of the
trip markham and clyde burke alike
shared the detectives opinion

  cardonas firm belief was a far cry
from the truth while the detective
still stood near the train gate goldy
tancred in the flesh was riding up
fifth avenue in a taxicab with bowser
riggins beside him

  it worked great bowser goldy
was saying i pulled the stall about
some tough guys being after me car-
dona fell for it so did that news
hound burke

  you ought to knock off that bimbo
asserted bowser

  burke doesnt mean anything now
returned goldy let him ride say
bowser when curry was all rigged up
and showed his grin he was a dead
ringer for me heres another laugh
cardona has put a dumb dick on currys
train-to make sure that i get to flo-
rida

  thats good laughed bowser
meanwhile you ducked out through
the service elevator but say-what
was the good of having cardona send
the dick along

  ill tell you growled goldy there
was a second dictograph hook-up in my
living room-under the radiator its
lucky i didnt make any phone calls
lately im going to make one right
now though

  theres a big job right ahead and
ill be in on this one bowser youll be
with me im not taking any chances
i was glad to pay that boneheads ex-
penses for a soft trip down to florida
along with curry

  that dick will be an alibi bowser
whatever happens i wont be known
in it those dictographs have got me
worried were up against some foxy


the shadow magazine

game so im playing it safe and if
mr cardona is in back of some smart
plan to trap me he wont get anywhere
he thinks im yellow bowser let
him think it-let him have me trailed to
florida

  glistening gold teeth reflected the
glare of a traffic light the cab stopped
goldy and bowser alighted and went
into a dingy hotel not far from the cor-
ner where their trip had ended

  im going to make some phone calls
remarked goldy stick here bowser
im taking a room upstairs hang
around the lobby until i join you again

  goldy tancred was gloating over his
own cleverness just as joe cardona
hachaughed at what he thought was the
big shots departure so did goldy
chuckle over the sleuths mistake no
one goldy thought could possibly have
suspected currys make-up

  in this surmise goldy tancred was
wrong joe cardona had been bluffed
so had markham clyde burke had
been fooled as well moving away from
the train gate these watchers were sure
that they had seen the big shot leave for
florida

  but there was another observer at
that spot a man whose presence none
of the three had noticed a tall person-
age whose keen eyes gleamed from
either side of a hawklike nose had wit-
nessed the entire scene

  merely one of various persons clus-
tered by the gate this shrewd spectator
had gained a close look at the face
which joe cardona and the others had
mistaken for goldy tancreds the tall
personages observant eyes had spotted
a strained expression in the flashing
smile that had come from the peaks of
the overcoat collar

 this observer was the shadow
guised as a chance visitor to the rail-
road terminal he had followed up the
report relayed to him by burbank he
like the trio headed by cardona had

come to witness goldy tancreds de-
parture

  the shadow knew what the others
did not know an impostor had left in
the big shots stead the disguise of
the masquerading curry had deceived
other eyes but not those of the
shadow

  goldy tancred was still in new york
the big shot had gone into cover with
ping slatterly no longer alive to per-
form desired missions goldy was taking
up the work himself new crime was
impending and with it the insidious
menace of the black hush

  a soft weird whisper came from the
lips of that observer who now stood
alone by the deserted train gate the
laugh of the shadow it betokened grim
warfare against the tncnace that still ex-
isted

  the shadow had one mission now
that was to meet the minds of crime
with a method that they did not expect
to locate the source of the black hush

  the shadow knew

the man who feared

  harry vincent was standing beside
the living-room window of a com-
fortable apartment before him
stretched awkwardly in an easy-chair
was the man whom he had come to see
-don chalvers

  it had not taken harry long to work
up an acquaintance with his host last
night chalvers had been somewhat in-
ebriated when harry had spoken to him
at the night club this evening how-
ever chalvers was quite sober and in
an affable mood

  nevertheless harry from the mo-
ment of his arrival had noticed a tense
nervousness in the mans demeanor
tall ungainly but light in weight chal-
vers made an eccentric appearance and
this impression was increased by an oc-
casional face-twitching

  quiet and reassuring in manner
harry had found little difficulty in talk-
ing with his new acquaintance don
chalvers had apparently accepted him
on his word there was no question
brought up regarding the previous meet-
ing which harry had claimed as an ex-
perience in the past

  it was nearing midnight harry vin-
cent deciding that it would be unwise to
sound out chalvers on this first visit
resolved to forgo a discussion that
might lead to some word regarding ro-
land furness chalvers seemed too
restless perhaps it was because of his
carousing on the preceding night
harry noted that the man was weary

   think ill be leaving you remarked
harry as he stepped away from the
window when can we get together
again to-morrow night

  busy to-morrow night responded
chalvers but dont go yet vincent
dont go

   there was a pleading note in the final
tone harry could not withhold a
sharp look toward his companion he
noticed that chalvers was pale

   that was not particularly significant
for harrys impression at the first meet-
ing had been one of a pasty-hued
pudgy countenance but as chalvers
spoke this time harry could not help
but imagine that the pallor had in-
creased

  whats the matter questioned
harry you dont look well chal-
vrs

  i dont ffflfcwell the man com-
plained i haven t been feeling well
wait if youre leaving ill go down-
stairs with you and do a turn around
the block

  harry agreed

  the pair left the apartment and
descended by the automatic elevator
six stories to the street as they
strolled along together chalvers gripped
harrys arm in the darkness

 shad- a

  vincent he said suddenly come
back up to the apartment will you i
want to talk to you i have to talk to
you im worried-terribly worried-
and i must talk to some one

  harry glanced at his watch they
were standing by the light of a drug
store after short consideration harry
expressed willingness to return to the
apartment

  ill have to make a telephone call
he remarked there may be a message
for me at the hotel ill go right here
in the drug store

  call from the apartment-

  chalvers made the statement too late
harry had already reached the door
chalvers followed him and watched him
enter a booth while the engineer was
buying some cigarettes harry made
a quick call to burbank

  vincent reporting he announced
chalvers may be going to talk im
going back to his apartment were in
the drug store now

  all well queried burbank
absolutely returned harry no
possible chance of danger ill report
through mann to-morrow morning un-
less i learn something of great conse-
quence

  with this statement harry con-
cluded his call and joined chalvers by
the door of the drug store together
they strolled back and ascended in the
elevator

  chalvers was taciturn now harry
however knew that the man was hold-
ing his conversation until they reached
the living room

  back in the apartment chalvers flung
his hat upon a table restlessly he
drew harry to a chair and began to ex-
press his troubles in a breathless voice
all the pent-up worry of the man
seemed to break loose at once in a flood
of emotion

  vincent confided chalvers im
terribly afraid dont ask me whom i
fear its what i fear that counts im


the shadow magazine

afraid for my life maybe you can
help me

  tell me the trouble

  it all goes back to when i was in
college-chalvers was speaking less
hastily while harry listened without be-
traying undue interest-and it involves
a friend of mine my best friend he
was but hes dead now poor ro-
land 

  roland

  yes roland furness do you re-
member vincent that two men were
murdered not long ago at the olympia
hotel two electrical engineers-the
newspapers were filled with accounts of
the crime

  i think i did read something of the
sort

  don chalvers rubbed his hands in
worried -fashion he stared toward
harry and his face displayed an ex-
pression that betokened a nervous
hunted man harry vincent remained
serene he was sure that he was about
to gain clews that would be of value to
the shadow

  when i was in college confided
chalvers roland furness was my
roommate he and i used to indulge in
unusual experiments we made a dis-
covery vincent-a wonderful discov-
ery i-i dont need to go into the de-
tails now but it was more than a dis-
covery it was an invention also it

was a ray-

  chalvers paused and looked about
him as though the very mention of the
fact might cause him trouble he licked
his lips nervously then resumed his
discourse

  a ray he explained that cast
blackness it played the hob with elec-
trical equipment when we tried it out
we kept on though and we got the
bounce from college we never gave
the details-simply took the expulsion
and said nothing

  furness didnt do much experiment-
ing after that he was too busy getting

his degree at the new college where we
graduated but i kept on fooling with
the idea had a model at my home up
in the catskills its still there but-

  chalvers paused and clawed at the
arm of his chair he looked toward the
door then leaped from his seat and
went over to turn the knob and peer
out into the hall satisfied he rejoined
harry

  somebody has learned the secret
he whispered some one has per-
fected an apparatus like ours whoever
has it is using- it for crime when fur-
ness was killed the olympia hotel was
plunged into darkness furness was
killed because he knew about the ray-
because he might have told

  i am the only other one who knows
they havent found me yet vincent
im practically in hiding- here im afraid
to tell the police i dont want it to be
known that im in new york

  look vincent-chalvers pointed
to the window-and see those twin-
kling lights the ray could put them
out it could enter here and grip you
and me it throws a hush too vincent
-a black hush-

  as chalvers pronounced the words
every light in the room went out still
staring toward the window harry vin-
cent found his vision completely blotted
the twinkling flashes of the city were
gone a blanketing blindness had ar-
rived with it a stifling pall that made
the shadows agent utter an inartic-
ulate gasp

  the suddenness of the happening
seemed to paralyze harry vincent he
was fixed in his chair unable to under-
stand this terrible stroke of darkness
weird silence hung like a shroud the
black hush had fallen

  grimly harry regained his nerve
he started to rise from his chair but
before he reached his feet hands
clutched at his arms the surge of a
powerful body hurled him back the
chair overturned and harry sprawled
the shadow magazine



upon the floor something struck him
underneath the chin

  blackness surged through harry vin-
cents brain as he succumbed to the at-
tack delivered by men from the dark

chapter xxii

plans of crime

  harry vincent opened his eyes he
was no longer in the room where that
strange blackness had fallen instead
he was lying in the corner of a stone-
walled chamber bound hand and foot

  two men were standing close by one
of them looked toward the corner as lie
heard harry stir the shadows agent
caught the gleam of gold teeth that
flashed in the rays of the single light
which hung from the ceiling

  come to have you the man ques-
tioned with a laugh well its lucky
you didnt wake up on the way here
saved yourself another wallop

  despite a dull ache in the back of his
head harry vincent sensed who his
principal captor was he had heard of
goldy tancred king among racketeers
and that gleaming face displayed the
mans chief mark of identity

  still groggy eh jeered goldy
well go to sleep again dont worry
about your friend were taking care
of him thats right-goldy laughed
as harrys eyes closed-take my ad-
vice youre going to be here a long
while it wont do you any good to
stay awake

  to all appearance harry vincent had
drifted back to a state of semiconscious-
ness this however was a pretense
harry wanted to learn all that he could
and he knew that his captors might
speak more freely if they thought that
he was in no condition to listen

  you saw how it worked hardigan
spoke goldy tancred to his companion
well thats the way it will work to-
morrow night plunk-all black-and
it stays that way

  harry vincent heard the name that
goldy tancred pronounced it told
him the other mans identity clipper
hardigan dock racketeer was an ex-
gang leader who had developed a power-
ful influence which the police had been
unable to counteract

   despite the efforts of union leaders
clipper had managed to control certain
groups of workers along the water
fronts of manhattan his strength had
passed its zenith nevertheless through
the aid of mobsters who intimidated
honest men clipper still retained power

  yeah growled clipper hardigan
it works all right but how long can
you keep it going

  we only needed three minutes to-
night returned goldy in fact we
didnt need it at all but i wanted you
to be in on a test did you notice the
way it quieted everything thats why
weve called it the black hush keep
it going just as long as you need it

   i figure about fifteen minutes is what
well need calculated clipper but i
cant be sure thats the trouble goldy
suppose we get caught right in the
middle of the job

  not a chance returned goldy
not to-morrow night well hold it
for the fifteen minutes then well lift
it it will be a cinch for us to see if
youre clear if you arent well put
on the gloom again-in less than ten
seconds

  sounds mighty good said clipper
hardigan in a meditative growl only
one thing goldy ping slatterly was
working with you wasnt he well-

ping got his-

  this is different insisted goldy
ping was busting into a bank he
and his crowd made too much noise
but you and your gang have everything
the way you want it come on clip-
per-you agreed to it before youre
not going to let this chance go by are
you 

   i dont like to


the shadow magazine

  right you dont that racket of
yours is going haywire it will be
ended before you know it this is
something real-and sure-

  clipper hardigan was nodding
goldy tancred clutched him by the
arm

  were all set clipper he asserted
listen now ill go over every step
of-

  sh-h clipper warned him that
bimbo there in the corner-

  let him listen scoffed goldy hes
still wondering what happened to chal-
vers hell find out soon enough were
going to keep him a while for good luck
well give him an earful to think about
if hes still awake-which i doubt

  the big shot cast a contemptuous
look toward harry vincent the young
man was lying limp in the corner

  goldy laughed he meant what he
had said let the prisoner listen it
would do him no good

  turning back to clipper hardigan
croldy tancred began anew step by
step he outlined the plan which he had
arranged

  with smooth convincing tones he
won every point in furthering this new
alliance clippers head was nodding
his lips were grinning as he approved
the final arrangements

  a pair of fiendish plotters goldy
tancred suave and scheming clipper
hardigan an iron-jawed ruffian with a
weather-beaten face that increased in
ugliness with every sentence his com-
panion uttered

  its good clippers statement ex-
pressed his final agreement well be
there-ready for the black-out im
counting on you though goldy

  ill be at the other end assured the
big shot

  a knock at the door followed goldys
words the big shot growled the
door opened and bowser riggins en-
tered

  got the car ready in the garage the
bodyguard said to his chief all ready

to go along

  right said goldy come on clip-
per

  the big shot extinguished the light
harry vincent heard the door shut a
key turned in the lock the trio had de-
parted the shadows agent was alone
a helpless prisoner

  he knew that his room was under-
ground he sensed that shouts would
be of no avail otherwise he would have
been gagged as well as bound vainly
harry struggled with the cords that
held him the effort was of no avail
to him

  through harry vincents aching head
thrummed a series of troubling thoughts

  his report to burbank it had been
unwise to tell the contact man that
danger could not possibly exist

  don chalvers the young engineers
broken revelations had come just before
the attack harry was sure that the
hunted man had encountered doom

  but uppermost in harry vincents
thoughts came the conversation that
had passed between goldy tancred and
his ally clipper hardigan in that dis-
cussion harry had learned the enemys
plans he knew the details of the
crime which was due to strike to-moi-
row night

  robbery-murder-those were the
contemplated acts which were to accom-
pany a gigantic scheme which only the
black hush could render possible the
outlandish plan was one that police
could never suspect

  even the shadow if he were alert
and ready would look for criminal activ-
ities in a thousand places before he
would pick the one where crime was
due

  harry vincent groaned he was in
the hands of superfiends his captors
were men whose greed for lawless gain
surpassed all other motives to-morrow
night their stroke would fall after

that they would attend to harry vin-
cent

  the shadows agent knew that he
could expect no mercy from goldy tan-
cred he knew that the big shot was
holding him merely to question him
later then kill him if he did not speak
yet harry was not annoyed upon that
score

  he felt sure that he would be safe un-
til after to-morrow night then with
a new crime to work upon the shadow
might fmd clews that would lead to his
captured agent harry had confidence
in the shadows power to rescue him
from desperate situations he had never
known the shadow to fail

  harrys thoughts did not dwell upon
his own plight however the throbs
that passed through his frenzied brain
repeated the knowledge that he now
possessed-the details of the contem-
plated crime which goldy tancred had
so openly disclosed

  if the shadow only knew but the
shadow could not learn harry vin-
cent the one man who could tell the
shadow all was buried in a stone-walled
prison

the shadow laughs

  white hands beneath a bluish light
a gleaming gem that flashed amazing
sparks from its color-changing depths-
the shadow was in his sanctum upon
his table lay clippings and other sheets
of paper beneath them was a map of
manhattan that overspread the entire
surface of the table top

  this windowless room knew neither
night nor day amid blackness that
was broken only by the blue light in the
corner the shadow worked in perfect
seclusion his sanctum was a spot
which no one other than he had ever
visited

  night had passed outside the sanc-
tum the light of a new day had ar-

rived but the shadow made no ac-
counting for the passage of time he
was engaged in a tremendous task
three times heinous crime had fol-
lowed in the wake of black hush after
the first occurrence the shadow had
been able to beat back the crooks who
had advanced

  but now the shadow was seeking
greater results indifferent to what plans
the enemy might hold the master of
darkness was striving to reach the
source itself well did the shadow
know that ping slatterly had been no
more than a tool in the hands of mas-
ter schemers

  the shadow had been piecing im-
portant facts before him lay the as-
sembled reports that told things which
detective joe cardona had failed to
even suspect

  the secret of the black hush

  the shadow was upon its trail

  a hand moved across the desk it
swept the clippings aside brilliant eyes
from the dark were focused upon the
huge map of manhattan deft fingers
produced white-headed pins one by
one the shadow placed these markers
on important spots

  first a pin touched the location of
the olympia hotel the second pin
marked the apartment building which
was topped by thaddeus harmons
penthouse the third pin rested upon
the exact position of the new city
bank the fourth entered the street in-
tersection where traffic had been halted
to allow the escape of fleeing crim-
inals

  after a pause the fingers put another
pin upon a line that indicated the sixth
avenue elevated the keen eyes of the
shadow surveyed the studded surface of
the map

  those pins indicated an important
fact they showed that the strange
blackness of the hush could easily have
been projected from a single point

  significantly the forefinger of the


the shadow magazine

shadows right hand moved from one
pin to another the markers thus
touched were the ones which showed
the elevated and the street intersection

  these were the two places that gave
the important clew at the hotel the
apartment the bank-all three meant
nothing more than the manipulation of
electrical equipment within the build-
ings themselves

  but the elevated line and street in-
tersection these spots where black-
ness had fallen were sure indications
of a pall that had descended from the
night itself

  with a pencil the hand of the
shadow traced dotted lines on the face
of the map from the olympia hotel
alone the indicating line might have
gone in any direction with the pent-
house as a starting point there were
logical places where its line and the line
from the hotel should cross

  the line from the new city bank
produced a further limitation the line
from the street intersection meant an-
other narrowing of the search yet the
shadows problem of survey work had
not yet been completed

  one more pin might have solved the
calculation the shadows finger lin-
gered upon the sixth avenue pin that
one was useless identified with the new
city bank it gave no additional aid to
him

  the shadow waited his keen brain
had been wresting with this problem for
hours the light snapped off within
a darkness as total as that of the black
hush the shadow dwelt in solemn
thought a hand moved forward in the
blackness it found a set of ear phones
a tiny light glimmered on the wall be-
yond the table

  burbank speaking came a voice
over the line

  report on vincent were the
shadows quiet words

  no further report burbank replied

  check through mann ordered the
shadow

  the light went out when it re-
turned burbank opened the conversa-
tion 

  no report received by mann

  silence then came the whispered
voice of the shadow it came as a sud-
den thought of inspiration

  call burke ordered the shadow
tell him to call the apartment house
where chalvers lives call from the
classic office requesting information on
lighting serviceinterrupted there last
night

  the tiny bulb went out on came the
blue light above the shadows table

  there in total darkness the shadow
had gained a new connection there
was no report from harry vincent the
agent might have met with unexpected
enemies if so the meeting had pos-
sibly occurred in the apartment of don
chalvers

  the enemies whom the shadow now
combated were men who acted under
cover of the black hush perhaps that
strange phenomenon had occurred last
night at the place where harry vincent
had been stationed

  anticipating this chance the shadow
placed a pin upon the location of the
apartment where chalvers lived he
began a new tracing of dotted lines

  this was the one he needed it indi-
cated a central point in manhattan
where all the lines showed perfect con-
vergence

  the little bulb was gleaming the
hand of the shadow lifted the ear
phdnes from the table burbank was
ready with a prompt report

  call from burke came burbanks
quiet tones report from the apart-
ment house lighting service was in-
terrupted there for a few minutes last
night regarded as dynamo failure

  the bulb went out the ear phones
moved across the table the hand of the
shadow produced a black-headed pin
the shadow magazine



carefully the fingers placed it at the
focal point of the dotted lines

  that pin with its jet-black top
marked the location which the shadow
had been seeking it showed the spot
in manhattan from which the black ray
had been projected

  it was resting exactly upon the build-
ing site occupied by the new judruth
tower

  a full minute passed while the eyes
of the shadow gazed upon the map
the blue light cast its eerie flicker the
girasol upon the shadows finger
seemed to flash triumphant sparks from
its glimmering depths

  blackness followed as the hand of
the shadow extinguished the light a
long reechoing burst of hollow laughter
pealed through the confines of the sanc-
tum quivering reverberations sent their
persistent shudders through the spaces
of that black-walled room when those
sinister echoes had ended the sanctum
was empty

  it was later afternoon in manhattan
a tall figure striding along a side street
paused to gaze up toward the sky keen
eyes perceived the jutting finger of the
judruth tower gleaming in the sun

  the observer laughed as he stood
alone his soft mirth sounded as an
echo carried with him from the depths
of the black-walled sanctum

  the shadow was viewing the tall
spire which harbored the secret of the
black hush there lay the source of
crime

  the shadow knew

upon the tower

  night was falling upon manhattan
the outlines of buildings were still visi-
ble twinkling lights in windows ap-
peared like sparkling jewels in futur-
istic settings from the windy open ob-
servation circle atop the judruth tower

a few late visitors were viewing the
splendid vista that lay below

  among them was a silent watcher
whose keen eyes were moving from spot
to spot in the scene that stretched be-
neath the shadow in the guise of a
curious visitor to the observation post
was viewing each place where the black
hush of crime had fallen

  the olympia hotel was plain with its
glimmering windows thaddeus har-
mons penthouse was a conspicuous
structure upon its apartment roof the
white face of the new city bank looked
like a tiny slab beyond the blackened
structure of the sixth avenue elevated

  the intersection of avenue and cross
street was close to the base of the build-
ing the observant visitor noted that
point then turned and located the apart-
ment house wherein harry vincent had
visited don chalvers

  from this pinnacle the shadow had
corroborated a belief that he had ac-
cepted while on his way to the judruth
tower namely that the force of the
black hush must have been projected
from one of the higher stories of this
edifice only from great height could
the results have been accomplished

  leaning over the rail the shadow
viewed the bulk beneath a straight
shaft traveling downward into dizzy
depths a mammoth creation of steel and
stone that defied the force of the whis-
tling wind-such was the judruth
tower

  somewhere among the windows that
were visible lay the source of the black
hush peering along the blackening sur-
face of the building this silent observer
waited for the opportunity that was
soon to come

  all off the tower came a cry from
an opened doorway last elevator go-
ing down

  the tall figure lowered itself within
the confines of the railed platform
black cloth swished when the figure
rose again it blended with the dusk that


the shadow magazine

now surrounded the pinnacle the last
visitor had become a phantom shape
garbed in black cloak and black slouch
hat

  a watchman swinging a lantern be-
gan a circuit of the platform he did
not see the gliding shape that preceded
him when he had completed his round
he was positive that every visitor had
passed within a metal door clanged
the last elevator started on its down-
ward trip the tower had closed for the
night

  but there was -one who still remained
the shadow master of darkness was
aione on the observation platform of the
judruth tower with the whole spar-
kling array of glittering manhattan far
below him like the brain of a mam-
moth being he could visualize all that
passed beneath

  while the increasing wind swirled
in powerful gusts this strange phantom
began its solitary round of the platform
sharp eyes gazed out over manhattan
then peered down the walls of the build-
ing the shadow was studying the city
as well as the edifice upon which he
stood

  the shape came to a halt a weird
laugh was caught by the increasing
wind in his circuit the shadow had
completed important observations yet
he waited sensing that time might bring
the vital moment at which to begin a
strange and hazardous course

  up here the shadow was the master
above the source of the black hush he
could bide his time

  gazing westward the eyes of the
shadow saw the strip that denoted the
north river the lights of many craft
were glimmering above the darkened
waters gigantic liners looked like toys

  one vessel-lilliputian from this ob-
servation tower-showed as an outline
that sparkled with many lights as tiny
tugboats barely discernible drew it out
into the mighty stream

  the keen eyes of the shadow rested
upon that ship a laugh escaped the
shadows lips the vessel was the gar-
ronic the latest and most modernized of
all liners that plied between new york
and europe

  the huge ship was driven by electric
motors once in the center of the river
it would loose itself from the tugs that
were backing it into the stream from
there on it would proceed under its own
power to the lower harbor

  why did the shadow watch that
single boat

  there was an answer moving back-
ward from the pier the ship made a
conspicuous sight of all objects visible
from this tower it was the most plain

  the passenger list of the garrnic
had made it famous for this coming
trip among those aboard was the
noted siamese prince whose visit to the
united states had brought blazing head-
lines with him this celebrity was car-
rying gems of fabulous value-prized
stones that were guarded by his trusted
retinue

  the shadow was dwelling upon that
fact from here the garronic had the
semblance of a tiny toy which a mam-
moth hand could pluck from the river
and shake of its contents such a hand
did not exist but here not many feet
below lay a power as mighty as that of
a gargantuan fist

  if ever the black hush could prove
of use to crime now was the oppor-
tunity it was the obviousness of that
fact-so plain from this tower-that
caused the shadow to watch the back-
ward motion of the garronic

  close to mid-river the great boat was
still under the control of thetugs they
were swinging its stern upstream the
prow was heading toward the bay

  the laugh of the shadow rose above
the wind its uncanny mockery was a
challenge to foreboding crime weird
and mirthless the laugh broke into a
wavering sinister tone with that
the shadow magazine



strange token of the shadows mysteri-
ous presence came the stroke that the
master mind had expected

  in one quick instant the entire hull
of the garronic disappeared from view
with it went every light the tiny tug-
boats and their signals were blotted out
from view between the great ship and
the pier lay a stretch of complete
gloom

  the black hush had fallen under its
spell lay the huge ship vanished while
the shadow watched wealth beyond
price was at the mercy of the men who
were waiting the blotch that was to
serve them

chapter xxv

out of the ray

  swiftly the shadow acted here
from the observation platform of the
judnith tower he held a new and amaz-
ing vantage point the black ray lay
below him its conical projection
formed a tapering tube of darkness that
no eye could penetrate

  from below that darkness could not
be observed against the sky but the
shadow saw it as a swath of black that
obscured the lights of the city beneath
its path more than that he could de-
tect the starting point-a corner room
two floors below

  within the circle of the observation
platform was the lounge room and the
information desk the door was close
behind the shadows form turning
the rays of a flashlight guiding his
movement the shadow reached the
telephone that connected the tower with
the main floor of the building an op-
erators voice responded

  police headquarters ordered the
shadow

  the operator hundreds of feet below
responded with trancelike precision a
call from the tower at this hour a
voice that sounded like the knell of
doom i

  the shadows call was answered in
cold steady tones the man from above
passed the startling word that brought
news of unknown crime

  motor ship garronic came the
shadows voice attacked by gang-
sters in the harbor criminals aiding
from post on ninety-third floor of jud-
ruth tower

  that was all the receiver was on
the hook sweeping swiftly through the
gloom the shadow reached the ob-
servation platform with the abandon
of a man seeking suicide he vaulted
over the rail poising his long form
above the man-made chasm below

  the shadows swing came to an
abrupt stop as his body slid down the
wall of the building his hands using the
cornice below the rail as a new gripping
point a mighty gust of wind swept the
building but its ferocious blast did not
detach the clinging shape in black

  the decorated surfaces below the ob-
servation platform were the shadows
stepping-stones poised on the brink of
oblivion undeterred by the gale that
sought to break his unerring clutch the
black-clad master of the night began his
death-defying descent

  a thousand feet of nothingness yet
the shadow was as calm as if he had
been less than a yard above the ground
there were projections that he could
grasp and he found them in the dark-
ness blotched against the surface of
the uppermost heights which the jud-
ruth tower could boast the shadow
was crawling like a beetle toward his
goal-the ray of blackness that lay two
floors below

  the shadow had conquered smoother
surfaces than this but to-night he
fought with terrible hazards speed
was essential and he acquired it de-
spite the menace of the terrific wind
that whirled the folds of his cloak

  then as the shadow poised above
the window from which the blackened
ray extended he performed a weird


the shadow magazine

maneuver that brought his body side-
wise on a level with that open spot

  death yawned below enemies lay
within the shadow paused was he
planning to return to the only spot that
afforded the slightest vestige of safety
-the observation platform above only
the shadow knew but others were
soon to learn

  there were four men within the se-
cret projection room to-night hector
fawcett was staring from the window
yet he could see but little for the black
ray swept close against the side with
fawcett was the big shot goldy tan-
cred behind them stood bowser rig-
gins goldys bodyguard

  in keeping with his promise goldy
tancred was supervising this end of the
crime while clipper hardigan did the
work below but the fourth member of
the group was as important as any one
present in the darkness behind the
glittering machine stood hobbs the op-
erator

  silently this controller of the black
ray awaited the orders that were to
come his hand was ready to lift the
pall of the black hush at the end of the
appointed time ready also to restore it
should hector fawcett or goldy tan-
cred give the word

  deeming themselves safe from all at-
tack these fiends were gloating over
crime which they were sure could never
fail the mighty ray of darkness that
hurled forth the black hush had stilled
all action aboard the garronic

  we cant be stopped to-night hec-
tor fawcett made the comment this
is the job that can never fail

  be ready though advised goldy
tancred watch for the tugboats
when we lift it if theyre still close
give them more of the black

  bowser riggins chuckled as usual
he reflected the opinion of his chief and
goldy tancred had spoken in a tone of
surety hobbs said nothing stolidly

this man who controlled the ray was per-
forming his duty with the same perfec-
tion that he had employed before

  ten minutes announced hector
fawcett thats half the time they
want theyre getting what theyre
after

  its a cinch commented goldy
say-look at that black-the way it
stretches out-

  hector fawcett laughed he knew
that goldy tancred was realizing the
power of this ray blackness cutting
within blackness it made a weird and
unbelievable spectacle

  i never saw anything like it added
goldy say-if anything ever came
out of that black you couldnt see it un-
til-

  the big shots sentence ended a
gasp came from his startled lips

  the cry caused hector fawcett to fol-
low the direction of goldys gaze bow-
ser riggins followed suit the three
men of crime staggered backward in the
face of a phenomenon more amazing
than the shaft of gloom which they were
viewing

  out of the blackness came a living
form as if a portion of the black hush
had detached itself from the steady un-
erring ray a creature of another world
had materialized itself from that pro-
jected gloom

  like a spirit of darkness a tall form
swung over the window ledge and
landed in huddled shape directly in
front of the men who watched then
instead of a dwindled form the sinister
object stretched upward until it became
the semblance of a tall living being

  with a mighty spring this weird
monster leaped forward with out-
stretched arms toward the three men

  instinctively the watchers broke for
the sides of the room their cries caused
hobbs to see the object which had
brought them ghastly fear grimly the
man at the black-ray machine faced this
menace that had sprung from nowhere
the shadow magazine



  through an opened window nearly
a thousand feet above the ground from
a formidable blackness that obliterated
all objects in its path had come the su-
perman who had never yet failed in his
combats with fiends of crime

  out of the black ray-the shadow

  his precipitous descent from the ob-
servation tower completed the master
of darkness had used the black shaft
to his own advantage it had furnished
him the obscurity which he required to
complete this weird attack

  the shadow had arrived to take his
foemen unaware his objective was the
glittering machine that evil brains had
turned to the service of crime

  the hand of the shadow was stretch-
ing forth to end the blackness that was
now the aid of an attacking band he
was here-to fight the black hush at its
very source

  out of the ray-the shadow

chapter xxvi

below and above

  one light glowed aboard the motor
ship garronic that illumination came
from a powerful acetylene lantern in
the firm fist of clipper hardigan with
water-front mobsters at his heels this
gang leader was advancing to an assured
objective

  playing the parts of passengers
aboard the vessel clipper and his hench-
men had ignored the cry of all ashore
they had clustered close to the rear of
the ship all on the same deck ready to
head for the objective when the order
came

  when the liner had been backed to
mid-stream the black hush fell a few
seconds later clipper hardigans lan-
tern broke the gloom

  aboard a helpless ship on which
every means of illumination and power
had been eliminated clipper urged his
men toward the stairway that pointed di-
rectly toward the siamese princes suite

  the tugboats they were manned
by clippers henchmen like the motor
ship the smaller boats were wiped out
of sight

  the stroke of the ray had been re-
served for the moment when the tugs
were ready to cast off yet they re-
mained  for they were to serve clip-
per and his henchmen in their flight

  the tugboats had no lights now but
their primitive steam engines were not
handicapped by the impelling force of
the black hush with his acetylene light
clipper was out to gain the treasure of
the siamese prince then to blaze a trail
along a lower deck that would lead his
crowd to the waiting tugs

  that was why clipper wanted the
black hush to stay plowing out from
its depths the tugs could steam away
to safety they would be clear while
confusion still reigned aboard the gar-
ronic

  a perfect game-one which the
shadow was striving to defeat at the
one spot where success might properly
be gained that room in the corner of
the ninety-third floor in the judruth
tower

  clipper hardigan and his mob
reached their objective most of the
passengers were on the decks the way
was clear below clipper moved with
the steady precision of soldiers ad-
vancing behind a timed barrage

  stealthily the black hush aiding in
their creeping silence the mobsters
neared the door of the princes suite
here the glare of the light revealed an
opening

  startled members of the siamese
retinue had thought the light was
friendly they learned their mistake
as one of clippers mob fired an open-
ing shot that implanted itself in the
doorway

  the door swung shut but mobsters
hurtled forward and thrust it open
then came resistance

  the prince was not in his cabin but


the shadow magazine

he had others there besides the siamese
servants detectives and ships officers
who had been deputed to guard the jew-
els temporarily opened an unexpected
fire

  they clipped the first gangsters who
had rushed in front of the light mob-
ster shots responded from outside the
door a detective staggered  one of the
siamese servants fell clipper and his
mob pressed onward as the defenders
scattered before the overwhelming fire

  this suite possessed an inner room
-almost a strong-room goldy tan-
cred had gained full knowledge of the
arrangement acting in accordance
clipper ordered his men forward the
brief battle had caused a delay there
was no time for waiting

  the gangsters swept into the main
room of the suite with one accord
the defenders had dived for the shelter
of other rooms while his men cov-
ered the barriers behind which detec-
tives and officers had gone clipper used
the acetylene lantern to bathe the entire
scene with light

  trusted lieutenants made for the
strong-room they smashed at the
door bursting it from its hinges the
defenders knew that their cause was

the hand of the shadow was stretching forth to end the blackness
              to fight the black hush at its very source
the shadow magazine



hopeless they hung to their places of
safety awaiting the return of the ships
lights-the only aid which could equal-
ize the struggle

  the door ahead was open clipper
could see his men knocking it aside as
he looked through the murky haze that
his light was penetrating success was
here the surety that goldy tancred had
promised but as clippers lips emitted
a gloating cry the one thing that he
had feared occurred

  the ships lights came on

  clippers men hesitated then at the
end of long tense seconds the lights
went out again clipper laughed amid
the muffling hush this was as planned
the short spell of light had been ended
when watchers had seen that the job was
not complete

  before clippers men could continue
however the lights appeared again
once more off then on off on-at the
end of the quick succession the lights
remained

 consternation seized the mobsters
doors opened in the suite and the de-
fenders fired from ambush retreating
gunmen dropped as clipper hardigan
ordered them to withdraw new ene-
mies were at the head of the stairs a
real battle had begun

  the explanation for the sudden turn
lay in what was happening in the cor-
ner office near the top of the judruth
tower the shadow leaping to the
black-ray machine had placed his hand
upon the switch but as his gloved fist
clutched it hobbs with a sudden swing
threw himself upon the black-clad in-
vader

  the shadow held no weapon he had
expected to find his enemies without
their guns handy had fawcett goldy
or bowser made effort to draw a re-
volver the shadow would have re-
sorted to an automatic

 the men had cowered from the
shadows wrath the way lay open to

hobbs least formidable of all it was
he however who put up the resistance
his hand still gripped the shadows
fist as the ray clicked back and forth
a black arm swung from the darkness
hobbs collapsed as the shadows free
fist landed on his chin

  that brought the rush with one ac-
cord the three who had backed away
now flung themselves upon the
shadow with a wild cry goldy tan-
cred was crying his recognition of this
enemy whom all wrongdoers had
sought to eliminate

  the shadows form seemed to col-
lapse before the onrush goldy and
bowser drew revolvers as they fell upon
the huddling shape they sprawled
upon the floor as the shadow swung
clear hector fawcett staggering
against the machine drew a revolver in
his turn

  shots rang out from goldy and bow-
ser they went wide for the shadow
was making an elusive shift the roar
of an automatic responded bowser
riggins in front of goldys body took
the bullet

  hector -fawcett grabbing with his
left hand for the control lever aimed ii
revolver at the shadow the be-
spectacled crime plotter had a wonder-
ful advantage but his attempted double
action proved his undoing

  missing the switch with one hand he
fired wildly with the other then he
caught the switch and tried to shoot
again the shadows fire felled him

  hobbs was on his feet once again
the operator of the ray performed the
unexpected hurling himself against
the heavy machine he rolled it forward
the shadow was crouching directly in
its path

  the big device thrust him back to-
ward the window he fired twice the
bullets ricocheted from the side of the
machine hobbs instinctively shifted
his position the shadow stopped the
progress of the rolling ray machine


the shadow magazine

  goldy tancred scurried through the
door with hobbs close behind him the
shadow too late to stop them with his
shots laughed in the gloom beside the
window these men could not escape
him he had another task more pressing

  swinging into the room the shadow
stooped and thrust his shoulder under-
neath the machine that no longer func-
tioned with a powerful upward heave
of almost superhuman strength he lev-
ered the big device endwise through the
window it glittered there almost on
a balance a final thrust-the heavy in-
strument of crime plunged forth on a
thousand-foot fall to a deserted area-
way behind the mammoth building

  before the crash ascended from the
depths below the shadow had passed
the door of this corner room he had
hurled the ray machine to its destruc-
tion  now he was on the trail of the
fiends who had tried to flee

  goldy tancred king-pin of the plot-
ters  hobbs the man behind the ma-
chine itself-these were the two with
whom the shadow presently would
cope the door to the anteroom was
closed to block the shadows path it
was locked from the other side

  carefully a black-gloved hand in-
troduced a small pick into the keyhole
the lock clicked the hand gripped the
knob the door swung open as the
shadow slid backward into darkness
his automatic coming up in readiness

  across the anteroom an elevator door
was sliding shut the criminals had
gained a lucky outlet a foolish un-
suspecting operator had answered their
frenzied summons the shadow had
sent a warning below yet this blunder
had been perpetrated

  the shadow laughed mirthlessly no
elevator could be summoned now for
the men of crime had probably revealed
themselves by threatening the operator
with their revolvers yet the shadow
had not failed

  there was a reason why he had
wanted these men to live he knew
that harry vincent lay in their power
they alone could show the trail to
wherever the shadows agent might
be imprisoned

  if the police had arrived the fleeing
men would be captured but the
shadow did not count upon the law for
aid he himself would take up the
chase

  his tall form swung back into the
corner room it moved out through the
window with cloak close about him
to avoid the whirling power of the ris-
ing gale the shadow began the perilous
ascent back to the observation tower

  terrible space lay below the
shadow ignored it he paid no atten-
tion to the myriad lights of manhattan
nor even to the distant scene in the river
beyond where the motor ship garronic
lay in mid-stream with lights ablaze

  a mad fight was ending aboard that
vessel clipper hardigan and a hand-
ful of unwounded mobsters were clam-
bering over the rail of a lower deck
springing to the safety of a tugboat
that lay below

  their goal gained the mob leader
shook his fist at the men who crowded
the edge of the upper deck on the gar-
renic the tug was steaming away be-
yond the range of pot shots clipper
hardigan and his last few henchmen
were heading for the safety of the
shore

  the gang leader cursed as he heard
shrill whistles and saw the lights of
small swift boats approaching the tug
this was the finish the police boats
had arrived the tug could not escape
them now

  jamming cartridges in his emptied
revolver clipper hardigan prepared to
fight he stared futiiely toward the
spire of the judruth tower silhouetted
against the manhattan sky line

  no aid could come from there clip-
the shadow magazine



per hardigan did not know why he
could not see the tiny figure of the
shadow black in the night as it reached
the rail of the observation platform

  there were men upon that circle
they had come up to investigate the
mysterious call from this spot they
had found no one

  while they flashed their lights the
shadows tall form swung across the
rail it passed between the searchers
and entered the room within the circle

  when the investigators arrived there
a minute later they were surprised to
see a closed door where they had left
an open elevator stupidly they re-
alized that the man for whom they had
been looking had chosen that effective
means of escape

  the elevator stopped at the ground
floor the door opened slowly peo-
ple who had entered the lobby of the
judruth tower had rushed back to the
door to observe the results of confusion
in the street

  the stealthy form of the shadow
glided across the space it moved
through the outer door and merged with
darkness at the side of the building un-
seen by the group that was looking to-
ward the street where two policemen
were aiding a wounded comrade

  a whispered laugh sounded eerily in
the darkness the shadow was gone
he had ended the menace of the black
hush in manhattan

  one more mission lay ahead the
trail that goldy tancred and hobbs had
taken must be followed the shadow
was ready for that task

chapter xxvii

pursuit is ended

  a swift touring car shot out of a
manhattan garage not far from the
judruth tower the automobile con-
tained three men goldy tancred was
at the wheel hobbs was beside him
harry vincent bound and helpless was

in the back seat he had been dragged
through darkness by these captors and
hurled bodily into the car

  the vehicles top was down mounted
upon the back of the front seat was a
post upon it what appeared to be a
large searchlight

  the moment that the car appeared
shouts told of its arrival a policeman
at the side of the garage fired wildly
and missed his target

  goldy and hobbs had made a mad
escape by commandeering a taxi and
threatening the driver goldy had
wounded a policeman an advance mem-
ber of a raiding squad approaching the
judruth tower that had marked the
beginning ot the chase the pair of vil-
lains had left the cab and hurried into
the garage where they had picked up
harry vincent and thrust him into their
own car

  a siren sounded as a police car shot
up the street in pursuit of the fleeing
touring car goldy tancred clung grimly
to the wheel hobbs calm in the dark-
ness clicked a switch on the peculiar
searchlight

  a flood of blackness swept behind the
touring car it filled the street and
buried the police car in its strange dark-
ness the power of the black hush put
the pursuers ignition out of commis-
sion goldy hobbs turned a corner and
swung along an avenue

  another police car was bearing down
shots burst from it hobbs responded
with the ray the new pursuer was
crippled the touring car kept on its
mad course

  then came a procession of strange
events hobbs pivoted the black-faced
searchlight so its darkened rays pointed
ahead throwing a pall that began some
fifty feet in front of the touring cars
headlights

  traffic was clear along the avenue
following a swath of darkness the
speedy touring car continued its mad
pace with nothing ahead to intercept it


the shadow magazine

cars were stalled by the powerful
gloom goldy tancred picked his way
by the short space of light which the
front lamps furnished

  the black ray became intermittent as
hobbs clicked the switch off and on
this system was effective it showed
the avenue ahead at the same time it
brought back the darkness that cleared
all that lay in the path

  picking a new course goldy found
another avenue and again headed north-
ward as the touring car bowled along
toward the harlem river a siren call
resounded a police car was cutting in
behind word of the fleeing men had
been telephoned from headquarters

  hobbs swung the grange searchlight
on its movable pivot a sweep of blacky
ness caught the police car in its glocflfit
once more a chaser had been thwarted
the touring car shot over a bridge

  a clear path it seemed open now
but as the fleeing automobile whirled
along the lighted boulevard a new pur-
suer threatened from above came the
thrum of a powerful motor a police
airplane had taken up the chase

  muttered oaths came from goldy
tancred he threw a hopeless side-
long glance toward the man beside him
this meant disaster the followers
from the air could keep pace with the
traveling automole they could swoop
down and riddle this car with machine-
gun bullets

  it was hobbs who counteracted the
emergency he the operator knew the
full power of the black ray the black-
faced searchlight pointed upward its
projected darkness suddenly blotted out
the lights of the biplane that was swoop-
ing from above

  the touring car was traveling at a
clip faster than sixty miles an hour
gauging this speed hobbs coolly
wielded the ray at a somewhat faster
pace  the police plane was enveloped
in a wide range of blackness

  its motor stopped the pursuing ship
was helpless close to the ground it
banked as its pilot tried to avoid a crash
completely obscured by darkness with
ignition out of commission the situa-
tion reached a critical point

  the touring car whirled onward
hobbs lost the focus lights glimmered
above as the biplane was freed from the
power of the black hush good for-
tune however came too late the pur-
suing pilot managed to pick a vacant
space but his plane crashed in the sud-
den landing

  harry vincent staring upward saw
the lights of the biplane whirl in the
final spin the shadows agent closed
his eyes on through the chilly night-
he did not know where he was being
carried he realized only that the last
attempt to halt this fleeing touring car
had failed cold almost to a stupor
harry forgot the passage of time

  when the prisoner opened his eyes
he found that the car had stopped in
front of an old house they were in
an isolated spot harrys captors
dragged him from the automobile they
carried him around the house to a low
flat building beyond

  through a door then harry found
himself flat upon his back in what
seemed to be a stone-floored room a
light came on harry stared at the
gloating face of goldy tancred there
was no mistaking the big shot the flash-
ing mouth betokened his identity

  who was the other  harry had heard
goldy call his companion by the name of
hobbs the second man was turning
to his amazement harry saw the pale
face of don chalvers

  like goldy chalvers was grinning
harry vincent realized that the young
engineers nervousness had been an af-
fectation

  well did harry understand the rea-
son for the murder of roland furness
don chalvers possessor of the black

shad-a
fhe shadow magazine



ray had found it essential to eliminate
the one man who might have betrayed
the secret

  im bringing in the projector chal-
vers informed goldy setting it up
on this flat roof if any one heads this
way it may prove useful

  not much chance responded goldy
we shook them right im not worry-
ing

  nevertheless chalvers went about
his duty goldy tancred remained
glowering at harry vincent at last
while his companion was still absent
goldy addressed harry with a hostile
growl

  youre working for the shadow
eh

  harry did not respond to the big
shots quiz

  trying to keep mum goldys
question was sneering well well find
out how to make you talk maybe you
think weve been licked to-night not
us we lost a good guy-they got
clipper hardigan sure enough but
the brains are still here chalvers
fooled you eh framed you up in his
apartment well hes smart-and so
am i

  harry still preserved silence min-
utes passed don chalvers returned
he and goldy tancred held a confer-
ence the big shot swung toward
harry vincent

  look here he said were giving
you a break were going to scram
see out of the country ill tell you
where-to london were going to
crack the bank of england when we
get this ray of ours in operation

  you think im kidding you not a
bit of it theres only one person who
might put a crimp in our game thats
the shadow-the one youre working
for so heres our offer spill what
you know stick with us and bluff
the shadow into thinking that well kill
you if he moves

  hell stay out of the game if it

 shad-a

looks best well give you a chance to
send him phony information take him
off the trail youll get your cut out
of the swag

  harry vincent remained obdurate
goldy tancred watched the captives
face during long minutes at last the
big shot turned to don chalvers

  he wont squawk announced
goldy tancred he still thinks the
shadow can pull him out of this pickle
theres only one thing to do give this
heel the works--

  goldy tancred stopped suddenly his
gold teeth shone as he scowled he
grasped don chalvers by the arm and
the pair assumed a listening attitude

  the reason for the interruption came
suddenly to harry vincents ears

  from somewhere in the distance the
thrum of a motor was announcing the
approach of what could be only a ship
of the air that sound brought joy to
harry vincent it might mean that
the shadow was coming to this spot

  but as harry thought he could not
repress a groan don chalvers had
made preparation for such an attack
the shadow was coming into the power
of the black ray

chapter xxviii

the final stroke

  upon a flat roof beneath which
harry vincent still remained a prisoner
goldy tancred and don chalvers were
standing in a hazy gloom it was still
dark here close to the ground but the
sky above was tinged with early dawn

  beside the two men stood the pivoted
projector that could cast its dread black
ray goldy tancred growling was
staring toward the sky while don chal-
vers-again playing the part of hobbs
-was ready with the machine

  there he comes snarled goldy
pointing high above the horizon be
ready when he gets closer you can
spot him


the shadow magazine

  an oddly shaped plane was visible in
the pale hues of dawn hovering as it
approached the ship revealed spinning
blades that-whirled like a windmill

  that craft told well who piloted it
the shadow was arriving in his auto-
gyro

  good snorted goldy that ship
of his cant move as fast as the biplane
you knocked off give him the ray
when he gets closer its the shadow
-if we get him-

  the big shot did not conclude the
statement he was watching the prog-
ress of the ship and he left his com-
panion to understand that the end of
the shadow would mean the finish of
all possible attack or pursuit

  the autogyro came on don chal-
vers was waiting he could see that the
pilot was picking out the spot that he
wanted

  the shadow had found the connec-
tion between chalvers and the ray he
knew that the flight which had baffled
the police must have ended here

  thus the criminal engineer bided his
time the black-faced searchlight piv-
oted upward still chalvers waited
until the moment when the autogyro
would be in perfect range the ship
seemed to pause in air-not quite di-
rectly above the spot where the two
villains were waiting

  give it to him snarled goldy

  the autogyro was descending as the
big shot gave the order less than a
thousand feet above the shadow had
picked out the whiteness of the fiat-
topped building in back of the old house
which belonged to don chalvers

  click

  the black ray cut a widening swath
up toward the dawning sky just ds a
searchlight cleaves the night so did this
stream of darkness carve through light
the autogyro was blocked out by the
great circle of blackness the thrum
of the motor ceased

  that ends the shadow announced

goldy tancred watch him come
plopping out of there-the same way
the biplane crashed his motors gone

  the two men waited as their eyes
looked upward they could see no re-
sult the autogyro was lost in the path
of blackness it was vanished as com-
pletely as if it had disintegrated within
the folds of the black hush

  seconds went by goldy emitted a
puzzled growl as he turned to chalvers
in the dimness beside the black ray
goldy saw a sudden expression of un-
derstanding appear upon his compan-
ions face

  hes coming downward in the ray
cried the engineer hes guiding him-
self inside the blackness that auto-
gyro needs no power-the blades above
it resist the air

  hes heading-here  gasped goldy
you mean-you mean hes dropping
straight toward us

  yes screamed chalvers we
cant stop him now hell land-right

here-

  as the engineer broke away from the
side of the black-ray machine a shape
bulged out of the darkness wings and
wheels smashed downward toward the
roof the body of the autogyro landed
forcibly upon the black-faced projector

  the machine crackled beneath the
impact the black ray ended don
chalvers too late in his leap for safety
was smashed beneath the right wheel
of the gyro as it jounced away from the
apparatus which it had shattered

  goldy tancred saw his companion
fall with an ugly snarl he whipped
out his revolver he saw a form in
black bounce from the right of the
thudding autogyro goldy fired know-
ing that he faced the shadow

  the big shot missed the swaying body
as it slouched back into the cockpit of
the autogyro then as the wheels jog-
gled the ship back and forth goldy
raised his gun to shoot again
the shadow magazine



  an automatic spoke before the big
shot pressed the trigger the shadow
recovering from the bumpy landing had
fired in reply to meet the menace of
goldy tancred with a snarling groan
goldy staggered backward and sprawled
upon the flat roof

  the shadow tall and sinister
alighted fram the autogyro he bent
above the bodies of the men who had
sought to resist him goldy tancred
had a bullet through his heart don
chalvers crushed by the impact of both
wheel and jouncing body was coughing
out his last breath

  through the last gloom of early night
a clinging darkness that held to the
ground despite the approach of dawn
the shadow descended through an
opening in the roof in the room be-
low he found the bound form of harry
vincent quickly he released his agent
and drew harry up the stairs toward the
roof

  slumped in the cockpit of the auto-
gyro harry vincent could scarcely be-

the

 iieve that the rescue had been so sud-
 denly effected he heard the motor
 hum with spinning fan now motorized
 the autogyro rolled across the roof and
 took off into the lightening sky

   high above it seemed to hover be-
 neath lay the whiteness of the roof now
 visible in the growing light of day
 upon it were two blackened sprawled-
 out shapes that lay beside the glistening
 shattered bulk of a broken-up ap-
 paratus

   the ray of darkness would never
again be projected by the fiends who
lay beside their shattered machine the
power of the black hush had been
ended

   with the final stroke the shadow
 had brought doom to the last of those
 who had plotted amazing crime don
 chalvers the creator and goldy tan-
 cred the instigator were dead

   the secret of the black hush had
 been solved and its weird force had
 been ended through the mighty strength
 of the shadow

phatically his two chins waggled not
the shadow magazine

taker there n everything you know

  mccord shook his head he lighted a
cigarette and glanced at his watch
cranstons stories were apt to take time

  but cranstons twinkling agatelike
eyes were looking past him

  its over on lonesome cove the
house is he rumbled reminiscently
its a honey of a place big rambling

  house miles o sea on one side miles
o dunes on the other used to stay

past ten now and im getting up early
to-morrow going to try and track
down this dope tale along the shore the
other side of weston so long
good luck to you

  left alone cranston yawned till the
hinges of his jaw creaked he lighted
his pipe and picked up the paper the
wind was blowing inshore whistling as
it rushed past the scattered village ex-
cept for the wind everything was still
cranston began to feel drowsy

  he got up slowly intending to make
himself a cup of coffee on the gas
burner the coffee never was made

  the telephone shrilled cranston
waddled rapidly across the office and
picked up the receiver

  well he asked

  an agitated feminine voice chattered
at him

  this is susan hunter chief cran-
ston    whats that as the chief
swore under his breath oh i thought
you spoke well listen i can see the
doring place from my attic window i
just happened to go up there to-night
to get an extra blanket and theres lights
all around the doring house

   theres a caretaker there explained
cranston curtly

  but miss hunter wouldnt be soothed
no caretaker dances with lights on the
dunes she insisted

  dances say miss hunter sure


the shadow magazine

  you aint been dreamin cranstons
temper was growing short

  no i havent been dreaming
snapped the lady i said dances and i
meant dances theres things going on
over there and im going down to see
whats what you can refuse to do
your duty and sit tight if youve a mind
to

  the receiver went down with an
irritated jerk and the chief wasted sixty
seconds telling the empty air a few of
the profane things he thought about
women then still grumbling and mut-
tering he heaved his great bulk into a
thick mackinaw jammed a cap on his
head and stuck an extra gun in his
pocket

  he left a note for burrows the cop
on night duty asking him to take care
of the office for an hour or so when he
came in off the beat he didnt tell him
it was susan hunter who had called
him out because he knew what a laugh
it would give the younger man to think
of the chief gallivanting again in search
of some of miss hunters famous imag-
inary sights and sounds

  when he started out of the court-
house which housed both his office and
the jail cranston was mad enough to
bite somebody

  the doring place was particularly in-
accessible it lay half a mile up the
state road from town and then almost
a quarter of a mile in from the road
across the sand dunes old man doring
had never built a drive in for fearof
being bothered with visitors and motor
tourists and tom doring hadnt seen
fit  to change matters since hed in-
herited the place probably because he
almost never came home

  the idea of the long walk in the
wind and dark on what cranston was
certain was a wild-goose chase was
enough to make any man ugly but he
wasnt going to have wasp-tongued
susan hunter saying all over town

  that the chief had refused to come out
when he was called for

  as he tramped along the road the
wind bit like a knife and he had to use
his flash constantly to keep from stum-
bling over loose stones in the pitch
darkness the cold penetrated even the
thick wool of his mackinaw and his
teeth were chattering before hed gone
half the way

  it wasnt a cheerful walk either the
dull boom of the breakers on long
shore could be heard in the infrequent
lulls of the winds howling the few
houses along the way were dark and
not a wayfarer appeared on the road

  by the time cranston got to the turn-
ing where the trail led to the doring
place he was breathing hard and his
feet and hands were numb with cold
he was too disgusted even to curse but
cut across the dunes doggedly head
bent against the raw blast it was
heavy going in the sand still damp from
a rain that day and more than once
cranston stopped to rest

  he strained his eyes to peer into the
darkness ahead but saw nothing stir-
ring there wasnt a sign of a light
dancing or otherwise for a second or
two he had half a mind to go back as
quickly as possible to the warmth and
comfort of his office but he gave up
that idea almost as soon as it was
formulated no use coming this far
and then turning back

  and then too all of a sudden it
seemed to him that he did see a faint
flash showing in the gloom at about
where the house would be 

  cranstons big round face took on
a more rugged look as his lips com-
pressed and his jaw set he doused the
flashlight and went on with a swiftness
of which he didnt seem capable his
feet made no noise on the sand and the
gorse bayberry and stunted conifers
with which the dunes were mainly cov-
ered were sparse here so that there was
no rustle of undergrowth
the shadow magazine



  this was a good thing because lone-
some cove in which the house was set
was sheltered by trees from the sweep
of the dunes and from the open ocean
by a small bay and high sand cliffs so
the noise of the wind penetrated little
to its natural lastness

  all at once cranston stopped short
he whistled under his breath there
were lights dimly visible in the fine sea
mist cranston could see all about him
and the lights were dancing like will-o-
the-wisps across the peat bogs of ire-
land 

  all cranstons anger and reluctance
disappeared something was decidedly
wrong it was up to him to find out
what it was the heavy layers of flesh
which cloaked his massive frame cov-
ered layers of muscles which were
equally heavy these tightened and
hardened now he gripped his gun
a look of grim purpose appeared on his
face he hadnt forgotten how to go
into action

  as he moved silently toward the
lights they moved up and down seem-
ing to advance and retreat then sud-
denly they vanished and the blackness
was once more without relief

  cranston felt the sweat standing out
clammily on his forehead there was
something uncanny about those jigging
disembodied lights he dared not show
his flash but he could see the doring
house a mass just a little blacker than
the surrounding dark

  cranston went up to it and around
to where he knew the front to be he
felt for the porch rail and found it
and with his foot discovered the two
low steps which led up to the veranda
here cranston stopped and listened
there was complete silence nothing
stirred

  he mounted the steps and they
creaked ominously under his weight
he stopped again still nothing hap-
pened

  he crossed the porch and tapped at
the front door he knew the care-
taker pat mulvaney slightly but some-
how he knew that pat wouldnt answer
his knock he was right no one came
to the door and there was no sound in-
side the house

  cranston tried the door and it opened
cautiously he went inside and stood
still listening his gun was ready he
began to move toward the inner room
as he slid his big feet ahead of him one
after the other feeling the way he
jumped suddenly and his stomach
turned over with a sickening wrench
he had kicked something soft and
yielding

  he bent down and felt for the object
then he pulled out his flashlight the
time for caution was past his hand
had come into contact with a human
face he lighted the light and stifled
an exclamation of horror

  there crumpled at his feet in an un-
natural position her head bloodstained
and crushed lay miss susan hunter
who had bravely come over to see what
was what she was quite dead her
skull had been battered in with some
heavy weight

  cranston was white with anger
susan hunter had been a nuisance but
she was a harmless old woman and he
wll going to get the rat whod slugged
her he bent over her again running
his flash slowly up and down her limp
body her right hand was closed around
something and as the fingers had re-
laxed in death the glittering object was
partially exposed cranston slid it out
from under without disturbing the dead
womans hand

  it was a brass button torn off a coat
as susan hunter had fallen cranston
recognized is as one of a set which be-
longed to a blue jacket pat mulvaney
habitually wore

  so the caretaker was a killer why
what could an old woman discover
about him that would make him mur-


the shadow magazine

der her  cranston ran his light
around the walls everything was un-
disturbed  susan hunter had evi-
dently knocked at the door and insisted
on an explanation of the strange lights
mulvaney had let her in killed her and
gotten out

  cranston knew there was no tele-
phone in the old house so he couldnt
call the weston homicide squad any-
way he thought it was better to hang
around a while if there was something
in or around the house which was im-
portant enough to kill for chances were
there was somebody left to guard it

  cranston went through the back
premises he walked cautiously hold-
ing his gun level in the kitchen he
used his flash again and quickly doused
it it had shown him the head and
shoulders of a man outlined for a sec-
ond against the dark window the chief
held his breath if this light had been
seen hed probably be stopping a bullet
in the next few minutes

  but all was quiet again and he re-
carefully he tiptoed to the win-
dow

  outside the lights were dancing again
but this time it was easier to see what
the mists and dark had distorted and
altered before

  the lights were iantems carried by
men over the even surface of the dunes
and near by in the dim circle of light
they provided cranston saw that each
lantern showed the way for two men
who carried some kind of big bundle
between them these bundles they
were bringing alternately up from the
shore and apparently from under the
ground at a short distance from the
house

  for a moment cranston stared in be-
wilderment then he realized what it
was all about dope of course being
brought up from the shore and from a
cache to load in the trucks the cache
probably filled with the fruits of previ-

ous landings was the old root cellar
once used to store winter fruits and
vegetables

  lonesome cove was the best spot on
the coast for such traffic

  mulvaney was undoubtedly in the pay
of the ring and he had things all his
own way since tom doring was so sel-
dom at home susan hunter was prob-
ably the first person who had ever sus-
pected the place and she wouldnt be
telling what shed seen

  what was the best thing to do now
there was no sense wasting time search-
ing the house the big game was
obviously outside yet if cranston
showed himself now it was six or eight
against one at least and while they
were scattered one or two could easily
rub him out while the others took it on
the lam if now he could get them all
in one spot something might be done

  he decided to try waiting a while to
watch developments if he went back
to town or to the coast-guard station
their trucks might come and they pull
out with the evidence while he was gone
if he stayed they might get together
after the unloading was done and he
would have a fighting chance to make
a pinch at least he could probably get
near enough to hear their plans

  he went to the front door the back
was too risky it might creak or one
of the lanterns might come a little too
near then the game would be up

  cranston knew these men would top
at nothing to make their get-away the
dope racket carried heavy penalties a
load such as these men were carrying
meant a good many grand invested to
say nothing of the murder rap waiting
for mulvaney three good reasons for
making quick work with a watcher

  once outside the front door and
safely across the veranda cranston
moved quickly in the shadow of the
house he flattened himself as much
as he could and waited

  soon some of the men started bade
the shadow magazine



for the beach and the remainder disap-
peared into the cellar

  cranston strode across the interven-
ing strip of ground to where he knew
the slanting wooden door lay half-hid-
den in the sand

  there he got down on his hands and
knees and crawled laboriously into the
sand and coarse beach grass at one side
of the door then he raised his head
to reconnoiter

  there was a sudden brief flash of
light in his eyes and something whirred
through the air

  cranston ducked but he was a sec-
ond too late something crashed down
on his head colored lights flickered
dizzily before his eyes and there was
a minor explosion in his brain then
he slumped forward

  cranston came to with a pain in his
head that made him gag the hard sur-
face he was lying on didnt help him
either and the fact that his hands and
feet were tightly bound made him curse
himself viciously for a double-dyed
idiot naturally theyd have a scout
outside while they were moving the
stuff and hed been mug enough to go
out and practically beg the punk to lay
him out

  he opened his eyes painfully and
squinted as the light stabbed his head
with pain he was lying on the dirt
floor of the root cellar a lantern on
the floor near his head was throwing its
yellow rays into his aching eyes all
around him were piled boxes which he
guessed contained dope they were
marked pilsener type beer-- bot-
tles in black letters on the side

  mulvaney stood near the door of the
fair-sized underground room a busi-
nesslike automatic in one hand six
other men were standing in a huddle
near the steps

  on the steps going above ground
cranston could see the legs of another
man he had all the crooks together as

hed wanted and a lot of good it was
going to do him

  he wondered if burrows would have
wit enough to do anything about it if he
didnt get back probably he wouldnt
even worry

  after he came off the night beat bur-
rows generally went home to bed cran-
ston then slept on the couch in the office
within earshot of the telephone till it
was time for grimes the other cop to
come on duty alternate weeks they
reversed the process this casual po-
licing had been enough for duneton up
to now

  most likely to-night burrows had
bedded down on cranstons cot and was
sleeping the sleep of the just trusting
hed hear the phone if crime should
suddenly break out in the village

  in the meantime the floor wasnt get-
ting any softer cranston stirred

 one of the men turned hey
boss he snapped fat heres cornin
out of it

  he had the ferret face and shifting
eyes of a city rat as he spoke he
raised his foot and kicked the police
chief sharply in his well-padded ribs

  cranston grunted and his little eyes
reddened

  brave guy aint you he jeered
when you got a real man hog tied

  the crook raised his foot again with
a snarl but the man he called boss
turned on him his visored cap was
pulled low over his eyes and a thick
growth of beard and turned-up coat
collar disguised the lower part of his
face

  lay off him a he growled
weve got no time to fool around now
wonder how the hell he got here

  the other men turned to look they
were of different sizes and coloring but
all had rotten cruel faces and all car-
ried guns leveled for action

  mulvaney looked more brutal than
the rest but uglier and less cunning
looking at him cranston wondered


the shadow magazine

how he had up to now missed the evil
expression in his squinting eyes and the
bestial look about his coarse mouth of
the man

  their eyes met and mulvaney laughed
coarsely

  darned if it isnt cranston the po-
lice chief he sneered the first time
he ever got wise to anything ill bet
it was an accident if you got him
boss you got em all theres only
one of em goes on duty at once in
this burg and all three of ems asleep
all the time

  cranston eh the boss stared
police chief you say well i guess
the townll have to do without one for a
while

  want me to bump him off boss
one of the torpedoes offered helpfully
but he was silenced by the leaders
snarl

  no you big mug weve got to get
this stuff unloaded and piled ready for
the trucks-and do it quick were in
a spot i tell you why the hell else do
you suppose i came down here myself
some of the hicks around here have
spotted our boats theyre putting out
patrols so far the trucks are clear
but we cant use this place again for
a storehouse for a long time well take
this hunk of beef on the truck with the
broad mulvaney bumped he may
know something well squeeze him
and then drop him in a pond with the
stiff

  step on it now itll take us half
an hour to finish unloading and weve
got to make sure the sands packed hard
enough for the trucks to get in without
miring if it isnt rustle some planks
they cant wait for light this time

  cranston felt more cheerful they
werent croaking him right away and
he had half an hour it seemed to him
as if he ought to manage some kind of
an out in that time

  some of the men went out the oth-

ers piled boxes together and swung
them clear of the ground

  take em out half way to the main
road the boss ordered them then
the trucks wont have to come all the
way in tell the boys to help you as
soon as they get the last load off the
boat show a little action there

  as the man left the cellar cranston
held his breath if they left the lan-
tern on the floor and if the guard stayed
outside the cellar he had a dogs chance
of doing something about things

   the last pair left and the lantern still
glowed by cranstons shoulder but the
big hood who acted as scout sat down
on the steps cranstons heart sank
then rose as the boss rapped

  you gus get outside and keep a
lookout in case this bird has any one
tipped off to come after him theres
no time to make him talk now and
tell the boys thats taking stuff to the
road to go help the guys on the boats
then they can all turn down here itll
save time

  o k grumbled gus but i
could be givin the fat guy the woiks
while the rest was loadin

  yeah and have him yell the place
down listen you be content to be
a good cannon dont try to think get
out there and get out quick

  there was a crack to that last order
that made the big gorilla move and
move fast he went up the steps and
sat down one big foot dangling within
range of cranstons vision

  the boss went past him with a last
snarl of warning

  now was cranstons chancy

  painfully he started to hitch him-
self up past the lantern the scouring
of the rough floor against his bound
hands was agony his great weight
pressed the cords into his fleshy wrists
and he felt a searing raw bite as he
dragged himself along his breath
came in gasps of pain sweat poured
the shadow magazine



from his big body and into his eyes
each second seemed an age

  every time gus stirred he lay flat his
heart pounding but still he inched his
way upward till the lantern was on a
level with his elbows another few
minutes and it would be at his wrists

  he felt the warm blood trickling
down his hands each time he moved
the earth dragged across raw flesh
every strained muscle ached like a bad
tooth cranston bit his lips and made
his breathing shallow so that wheezing
shouldnt escape him another inch and
another-each one might have been a
mile but he made it at last the lan-
tern was flush with his fettered hands

  with a final effort he rolled his
straining sweating body over and
shoved his wrists against the red-hot
glass then the real torture started
the heat next his torn and bleeding
flesh was almost intolerable cranston
clamped his teeth against the groans
which rose in his throat his stomach
heaved with nausea

  but there was a smoldering of cord
and flesh an acrid smell from both
cranston wrenched his head back to
look at gus the gorilla had gone
probably to give the new orders to the
other hoods he wouldnt worry about
the trussed prisoner

  cranston knew fresh hope but he
had to hurry at any moment now one
of the working parties would be back
for more cases he set his jaw and
held his wrists as closely as he dared
to the lantern without risk of over-
turning it

  another few seconds of almost in-
tolerable torment and he felt the strands
give another short sharp crescendo
of pain and they snapped apart his
hands were fre

  at first they were helpless but
cranston worked and chafed them till
he could move them swiftly he got
out his jackknife which the crooks had
either overlooked when they frisked him

or hadnt thought important and cut
the bonds about his ankles these he
rubbed smartly and winced as the blood
came flowing back into them

  just as he staggered upright he heard
guss feet on the stairs

  he staggered over to the steps and
waited when guss knees were visible
cranston lunged forward and tackled
the gorilla

  the crook crashed down face to the
floor-the breath was out of his body
his gun flew across the floor

  cranston made a leap for it he
raised it just as gus stirred and brought
it down neatly behind his ear the
hood went limp and cranston dragged
him across to the corner where he had
-lain so recently

  then he turned there was the roar
of a gun and a bullet parted cranstons
hair

  the first of the working parties had
returned the stairway was too nar-
row for them to stand abreast but over
each others shoulders cranston could
see the blue of their automatics

  he raised guss gun it roared once
and the first of the rats on the steps fell
forward with a hole through the left
side of his chest

  the other three started down their
guns barking viciously

   cranston felt a sting in his shoulder
he stepped back his automatic spoke
again-then once more and the second
crook fell at the same time cranston
swung a huge foot backward and
crashed the lantern out

  the two hoods swore their guns
vomitted a stream of fire toward where
cranston had been

  but he was crawling along the floor
he found one of the dead gorillas and
took his gun then he fired from the
floor a muffled howl told him he had
got home somewhere outside he could
hear the pad of running feet in the
sand the others were coming

  he got up and pumped a steady


the shadow magazine

stream of bullets in the direction from
which the shots were coming he
moved constantly suddenly he ran
into the great frame of one of the men
who also had been trying to keep out
of range cranston clenched a fist like
a hammer and brought it up to the
crooks jaw with two hundred and fifty
pounds of hard flesh behind it

  the hood dropped at the thud the
other one fired

  cranston felt a thump and a tearing
pain in his arm

  then a light showed the boss was
coming down the stairs with his two
remaining cannons after him one was
mulvaney a lantern swung from his
hand

  cranston wheeled the last man in
the gang hed just been fighting was
swaying on his feet cranston planted
a bullet between his eyes then he
lunged toward the boss

  the boss side-stepped and the two
other hoods came on down into the cel-
lar their guns leveled

  but with the quickness of desperation
cranston jerked the boss out from
against the wall and got behind him
he could have finished him off then
but he wanted him alive

  the two gorillas held their fire for
fear of getting the boss

  the boss stepped out of the way and
cranstons gun cracked twice

  both men dropped one was dead
mulvaneys gun arm hung helpless and
bleeding

 the boss whirled and cranston
grabbed his right arm and twisted
exerting terrific pressure

  there was a roar from the corner
cranston had forgotten gus the punk
had regained consciousness and was
using one of the dead hoods guns

  cranston had a sensation of shock
and felt his knees sagging his eyes
went dim with all his remaining
strength he hung onto the arm he was
twisting then he heard shouts the

tramp of feet some one grabbed him
and he was out

  cranston opened his eyes

  hey there he heard see what
you caught cranston

  the chief looked around he was on
the porch of the old house half a
dozen lanterns and flashlights showed
him burrows standing beside him
where he was propped against the rail
there was a group of coast guards and
two feds behind him and over in a
corner sandy mccord was standing
with a bunch of the weston force

  wheres the army and navy cran-
ston asked feebly

  burrows laughed youre a hero
chief id drunk too much coffee to
sleep to-night so when you didnt get
back i began to get steamed up i
found out from the night operator
about miss hunters call ill never call
that girl down for listening in again

  i called the long shore station and
they said theyd send a boat to watch
the cove they came over saw the
lights and called weston and the feds
patrol boat then we all got into the
cove and heard the shots this guy
you draped on when we got heres a
big shot hes big tim downey
bring him over here boys sos the chief
can have a look

  one of the federal men dragged the 
boss over by his cuffs

  we got the trucks too he ex-
plained they were regular brewery
trucks the drivers were in the pay
of the brewery and running dope on
the side weve had to be careful
about holding up trucks thereve been
so many howls about delayed deliveries
that headquarters warned us to go slow
unless we were pretty certain well
heres your prize

  he turned his flash on the bosss
face his cap was off his coat collar
down and his eyes were glowing mur-
derously
the shadow magazine



  cranston looked at him in the full
light and gasped

  why thats tom doring whose dad
owned this place he cried didnt
you know me tom

  sure i knew you doring rasped
but not well enough i thought you
were soft and i thought you were
dumb

  so thats tom doring mccord
strolled over the boy that made
good eh well hes sure going to get
a lot of free board

  cranstons round face was bewildered
we used to play together he mut-
tered as they took the crook away

  the next evening mccord dropped
into cranstons office

  cranston was reading the newspaper
accounts of the capture of big tim
downey and of pat mulvaney dow-
neys right-hand man the police
chiefs head shoulder and left arm were

bandaged but he was drinking coffee
with relish

  you ought-to be in bed mccord
told him sharply

  cranston shook his head im as
well off here he grumbled nothing
ever happens to tire a cop in this place
mccord grinned well if last night
wasnt exciting enough for you you
ought to be able to get to new york
on the strength of this little stunt of
yours im going on the story ive writ-
ten about it

  good for you congratulated cran-
ston but me-he frowned-i guess
ill stay here seein tom doring in
cuffs last night gave me quite a jolt
he was a good guy when i knew him
guess some of us hicks cant stand the
city anyways i know where i am
here and id a heap rather be a small-
time cop than a big-time crook believe
me

prisons on a paying basis

        recently a state in the western part of the united states has
    adopted a novel means of combating the deficit in its prison funds
    and hopes to put the penal system on a paying basis heretofore
    the state has put all her prisoners to work on state-owned farms
    but as the work only lasted for a few months out of the year due
    to the inclemency of the weather the farms soon were mired in
    debt the keep of the convicts cost more than could be worked
    out of the farm

        under the new plan the labor of the convicts will be farmed
    out to any reliable person-the state to receive not less than 
    a day for the services of each prisoner and to insure decent treat-
    ment on the part of the convict the state will have complete control
    over him at all times

       the state must house and feed him must guard him from any
   cruelties on the part of his employer and must set the rules as to
   the length of time he works and under what conditions

        not only does the state hope to get the penal system out of
    debt under this plan but it will raise the morale of the convict
    making him think of himself not so much a prisoner but a worker

calling south bay harbor patrol
stand by stand by

  the machinelike drone of the short-
wave police radio shelved against the
aft bulkhead of the police launch tiny
wheelhouse hummed suspense above the
steady rain patter topside

  sammy crammer of the morning
tribune till that moment slumped in a
dejected huddle upon the narrow wheel-
house bench hit the deck with both feet
his eyes brightened he glanced at the
bulkhead clock two hours until mid-
night and the dead line maybe after all
something was going to break

  sammys anxiety was genuine this
was no chance assignment he was cover-
ing for the first time to-night some
distant water front reporter had turned

out a book that with apologetic truth-
fulness exposed for once the unevent-
ful monotony of that beat from a news-
papermans point of view however
from a reading publics point the
apologetic endeavor had worked in re-
verse the public had suddenly become
water front conscious that accounted
for sammys shift from the fifth pre-
cinct police beat

  until further notice the water front
was sammys with more than a mere
hint from the city desk that plenty of
splash and human-interest stuff was ex-
pected

  the radio speaker had again taken up
its warning hum south bay harbor
patrol droned the repeat go at once
to lower bay anchorage harbor mas-
ter reports vessel lying off main chan-
the shadow magazine



nel with no riding lights aboard in-
vestigate and report

   the radio sputtered to its stand-by
 pur at the police-launch wheel pilot
 patrolman gus swanson reached down
 to lay a ready hand upon the engine-
 room telegraph beside him sergeant
  ryan skipper of the three-man crew
 aboard bent forward to peer through
 the rain-splashed windows for assurance
 of his position

   the sergeant straightened with a
 grunt o k gus he called still
 staring ahead swing er into the main
 channel full speed ahead

   jingle of the engine-room telegraph
 and aft the throb of the motors mounted
 in respond

   sammy watched the sergeant begin
 buckling the snaps of his stained white
 slicker he moved in close

   something hot sarg he attempted
 officiously look like something
 nah the sergeants answer was
 a disgusted drawl everybody aboard
 just drunk suppose nobody sober
 nuff to put out ridin lights that har-
 bor master layoutd drive you screwy
 nothin but rowboats ever use that
 lower main channel anyway

   the flash of hope within sammy died
 as quickly as it had flared he should
 have known as much with mere mention
 of lower bay anchorage nothing down
 there but fishing smacks gravel barges
 and tramp schooners lower bay of-
 fered free anchorage in the past few
 years it had grown to be a graveyard of
 rotting hulls and unchartered sailing
 vessels riding out the shipping slump
 with only owners or hired watchmen
 aboard or salvage protection nothing
 much could happen down there

   for ten minutes only the pound of
 the motors and hiss of the bow wash
 marred the wheelhouse silence ser-
 geant ryan manned the searchlight con-
 trol pilot patrolman swanson held
 her nose into the silvery painted beam

suddenly the sergeant bent forward to
shield his eyes with cupped hands at
either temple

  there she is gus his drawl
echoed back from against the wheel-
house glass just to port the channel
buo not a light on er bring er
longside

  the sergeant lifted a megaphone
from its bench stow he jerked the
catch-strap of the starboard window
dropped it open the police launch was
just rounding the square-cut stern of a
high-riding vessel the sergeant leaned
out to catch the white-lettered name
painted across its stern

   its that limey square rigger cleared
in from singapore three days ago the
sergeant called over his shoulder
scrape her side that looks like a
ladder hangin over the side midship
there

  swanson had already signaled his en-
gines silent the launch drifted under
her own momentum close in against
the gray-planked hull they scraped at
the wheelhouse window the sergeant
pointed his megaphone up toward the
deck above

  ahoy on board there he bellowed
into the blackness show a light
there was no answer from above
the police launch drifted along the hull
side in silence suddenly swanson
abandoned his post at the wheel and
rushing through the wheelhouse door
grabbed a long pike pole on deck to
hook them fast alongside a dangling
jacobs ladder breasted them swan-
sons free hand grabbed it for a moor-
ing

  ahoy on deck there the sergeants
heavy voice boomed out again any-
body aboard

  only the patter of the rain on the
wheelhouse seek answered the sergeants
hail the sergeant pawed with one
hand beneath his slicker a flashlight
beam shot out from his grip to focus
upon the ships rail above it swept aft


the shadow magazine

to the poop only lashed rigging and
rusted turnbuckles loomed in the beam

  mac the sergeant pointed his
megaphone aft as he shouted stand
by to hold er alongside gus and ill
go aboard looks like the tubs been
abandoned all right gus up with
yuh

  sammy now stood in the wheelhouse
door mac the engineman had ap-
peared as from nowhere to releave gus
at the pike-pole mooring hand over
hand gus was swinging up the dangling
jacobs ladder

the sergeant poked sammy from be-
hind up if youre goin he grunted

  sammy grasped at the hint of privi-
lege he reached for the swinging lad-
der

  awkwardly sammy pulled himself
over the vessels rail

  gus a flashlight in his hand stood
close by playing the lights beam about
the gear-strewed deck now it focused
upon a gray bulkhead midship the
dull sheen of a closed port caught and
reflected its beam an instant it showed
clear

  then into its frame popped a mask of
contorted terror two fear-glossed eyes
blinked against the brightness-blinked
then jerked back into the blackness to
signal a wailing cry of panicky horror
the night caught and muffled its echo
in the drolling whine of the wind
through the rigging high above the deck
of the ship

  somebody alive aboard here any-
way sergeant ryans drawling growl
came from sammys elbow must be
the galley there the sergeant continued
as he moved forward cmon gus
lets have a look

  together they rounded the bulkhead
corner to face a closed two-section
door the sergeant attempted to push
it open it held swinging his light
beam to the latch the sergeant delivered
a savage kick

  come out of there his voice bel-
lowed open up this is the police
dead silence echoed in the wake of
the kick thud then suddenly the shuf-
fle of scraping feet sounded upon
smooth planks the sergeant took a
quick step back

  a bolt inside the door clicked slowly
the upper section swung an inch back
a yellow slant-eyed face still con-
torted with suspicion peered through
the narrow opening it was the pinched
face of a chinese wrinkled and fur-
rowed with age the slitlike eyes
blinked against the flashlight beam as
they stared

  open up there the sergeant bawled
loudly what the hells goin on
aboard here wherere your ridin
lights wheres your skipper
behind the doors partly open sec-
tion the chinese suddenly caught a
glimpse of the police shield upon the
sergeants slicker the door opened
full

  missee pleecemen missee pleece-
men the thin twisted lips began whin-
ing yoo go capin cabin quickee
debil him kom catchee missee capiff
catchee missee joe killee eberbody

killee wong wong no-

  the sergeant had turned his light full
upon the chinese he did not need
sight of the pot rack at the mans back
to identify the space behind the open
door the stench of stale grease in-
creased as the galley door opened wider
suddenly the sergeant caught a glimpse
of the heavy cleaver the chinese held
gripped in his one hand without a
word the sergeant moved closer

  who killed who the sergeants
voice boomed as he advanced wliat-
cha talkin about you kill somebody
wong no killee wong no killee
came the quick excited jabber debil
killee yoo go capin cabin yoo see
debil killee missee capin alia samee
killee missee joe

  the sergeant was to the galley coam-

shad-a
the shadow magazine



ing somebody bumped off the cap-
tain in his cabin eh he grunted
o k cmon show us where
no no came the screamed pro-
test wong no go maybe debil he
catchee wong yoo pleeceman debil

   the jabber of the aged chinese raised
to a shriek as the sergeant made to
reach past the galley door still jab-
bering he backed away the cleaver
in his one hand lifted threateningly

  the sergeant still advanced sud-
denly his one hand shot out it gripped
the chineses wrist a twist and the
cleaver clattcred to the galley coam-
ing to bounce across deck a few inches
from sammys feet

  mechanically sammy stooped to
pick the weapon up

  the chinese had jerked himself free
to whirl and dash to the far end of the
galley

  the sergeant did not follow jerking
his head in a signal to gus he swung
his flashlight beam on past the bulkhead
aft watch that screwy chinaman
while i take a look aft he snapped im-
patiently i dont get this devil busi-
ness but theres something doin in the
captains cabin that must be aft here

   swinging his light in a point far aft
the sergeant started down the deck an
instant sammy stood undecided gus
had snapped his light off and now stood
giantlike in the galley opening the
swing of the sergeants light sent a
scatter of grotesque shadows scamper-
ing about the skeleton rigging sammy
felt a sudden tingle of uneasiness the
sergeants lighted path beckoned the
retrieved cleaver still in his hand
sammy hurried aft the sergeant
barely aware sammy trailed him moved
on

 aft to the main deck break and they
mounted the ladder to the poop at the
ladder head the sergeant paused to
sweep his light about in a quick inspec-

 shad-a

tion all seemed shipshape and regular
the stern chocks creaked lonesomely in
acknowledgment to the heavy mooring
hawser running over the side the
helm was lashed fast with a line about
a supporting stanchion before it
loomed the rounded top of a hatch lead-
ing below

  the sergeant crossed the deck
sammy followed a step behind reach-
ing the hatch the sergeant bent forward
to focus his light down it a startled
grunt pushed past his lips

  below huddled in a shapeless heap at
the foot of the companionway ladder
lay the body of a man

  the sergeant moved across the hatch
coaming that chinaman sure wasnt
talkin through his hat he muttered
more than spoke gathering his slicker
closer about him that birds deader
than a hunk of tripe

  holding his light ahead of him the
sergeant descended sammy watching
from the hatchway above a damp
mustiness reeked up from below the
sergeant had reached the lower deck a
moment he stared at the still body
then reaching down he carefully rolled
it over

  a ghastly leering face turned up a
face stained in death to a repulsive pur-
ple

  sammy felt a chill travel up his spine

  the chest of the dead man was
knotted into a deformed mass the
throat held an awkward bend the fea-
tures were contorted mouth agape with
blood dripping from a soaked mop of
beard eyes wide and bulging as if
forced from their sockets

  the sergeant still held his grip to the
dead mans shoulders now he shook
them suspiciously the body seemed
boneless above sammy caught the
sergeants puzzled grunt every bone
of the dead mans upper body seemed
crushed

  the sergeant turned to swing his light
up the narrow companionway below


the shadow magazine

  sammy moved over the coaming in-
side the hatch murder is it sarg
he called half anxiously think the
chinaman did it sammy was de-
scending the ladder as he spoke

  the sergeant had picked up a sea-
mans cap from the deck the gold-
braided title captain loomed over
its peak the sergeants light swung
back to the dead man his lips pursed
in a puzzled pose

  that chinaman couldnt have done
it came the uneasy growl look at
the size of that bird take the devil
himself to twist him up in that awful
shape

  sammy had reached the ladder foot
to now stand directly over the body
the sergeants light played carefully
across it

  the dead mans chest had been
crushed fiat then the body pulled about
to give it its gruesome aspect on the
head was not a mark save the track of
blood still dribbling from the lips that
and the wide protruding eyes

  the sergeant turned his light down
outlining the narrow companionway
three doors outlined themselves in the
partitioning bulkhead two on opposite
sides of the companion one partly open
at the companion end

   the sergeant held his light on the one
nearest moving forward he turned
its knob and pushed it partly open an
empty black silence dissolved in the light
beam

  sammy peered past the sergeants
shoulders two vacant bunks with a
bare cabin was his reward

  the sergeant drew back to close the
door and step across to the cabin oppo-
site it revealed the same though with-
out the air of empty vacantness evi-
dently this was the captains cabin
larger and furnished with a tinge of sea-
man homeliness the sergeant drew
back to move down the companionway
toward the open door at the end

   the first gleam of the light past the
bulkhead at the passageway end iden-
tified the rooms purpose the ser-
geant pushed the door wide a long
high table stretched across the cabin
center maps and charts were stacked
neatly atop navigating instruments
lay piled on a low shelf against the bulk-
head a heavy brass oil lamp swung
over the table center the chart room
-its seagoing atmosphere reflected in
the stow of each article about

  for a minute the sergeant played his
light about satisfied he moved across
the coaming to focus his light upon the
chart tables stack of charts and maps

  sammy followed a step behind to the
chart table sought the side opposite the
sergeant a step and he stopped short

  a round pit of blackness yawned up
at him from the deck alongside it lay
a heavy steel disk an open manhole
and cover of size barely enough to
admit a man

  sammy stepped close to peer down
an oily stench of bilge water greeted
him sammy identified the opening it
led to the bilge below a long lance-
like sounding rod stood propped against
the bulkhead alongside some one had
evidently been sounding the bilges below
and had been interrupted in the middle
of their task

  sammy moved the water-tight man-
hole cover with his foot it scraped
noisily across the deck

   the sergeant stretched himself to peer
over the chart table close that damn
hole came his impatient growl with
sight of the open hole it stinks bad
enough in here shove that plate in
place

  sammy reached out and laying the
cleaver he still carried upon the chart
table edge straddled the manhole to
bend forward and grip its cover an
instant he stared down into the inky pit
of blackness below-stared to suddenly
jerk erect a startled cry left his lips
his eyes popped widel
the shadow magazine



  below in that pit of blackness two
flame-lighted balls of fire seemed to rise
toward him rise pause then with a
swaying dance dissolve themselves into
the darkness two ghastly eyes that
never blinked in their ghostlike glare
sammy leaped back

  the sergeant was already around the
chart table what is it he shouted
whatd you see

  a puzzled grin twisted sammys lips
down there he managed to say in-
side the hole something-something

with eyes like-like-

  the sergeant took a quick step for-
ward his arm extended to focus his
flashlight beam down below the black
emptiness of the bilge wells loomed
back the sergeant cursed

  what the hells the matter with
you  his censorious growl stung
you tight or somepin theres noth-
in down there you must be-

  sammy only stared back his features
white and drawn now suddenly his
hand lifted in a signal of silence a
frown gathered across the sergeants
forehead

  listen sammy pleaded below
there hear it 

  the sergeant cocked his head to one
side dead silence then from below
a dull steady scrape echoed up through
the manholes hollowness a soft scrape
as of canvas being drawn across rough
timbers a slapping splash of water
swallowed the sound

  the sergeant straightened in disgust
say he snorted did you ever hear
of ships havin rats aboard suppose
this tub wouldnt be like that snap out
of it youre worsen that chinaman
suppose youll be seein a devil next
still mumbling the sergeant turned
again to the chart table he opened a
heavy book he had picked up at the mo-
ment of sammys interruption a min-
ute he read

  broddersons the skippers name
the sergeant finally offered absently

he must be the dead guy aft there
the chinaman was soundin off about
somebody named joe no joe in the
log unless-

  the sergeant stopped short from
forward came the sudden muffled re-
port of a pistol shot another fol-
lowed the sergeant whirled a leap
and he was across the chart-room coam-
ing

  thats gus he shouted as he
rushed down the companionway come
on somethings happened on deck

  sammy did not need the urge a
pace behind he trailed the sergeant past
the body at the companionway foot and
up the ladder to the deck topside

  to the poop rail and the sergeant
swept his light forward a darting fig-
ure caught for an instant in its beam
only to dodge clear amid the scatter of
deck gear the sergeant leaped down
the poop ladder to race forward
sammy still followed close

  to the galley and the sergeant swung
his light in the galley loomed black
and vacant gus gus the sergeant
bellowed pushing in where ya at
gus

  hollow silence dampened the shout
then faint and distant came a muffled
voice from some place below deck

  down here sarg driftedthe an-
swering hail below here be care-
ful-somebody down here

  the sergeant moved deeper withm the
galley at the far bulkhead an open
scuttle led below its cover was
thrown back a pit of darkness loomed
beneath the sergeant threw the beam
of his light down

  a crouched figure poised at the lad-
der foot it straightened as the ser-
geants light flooded the compartment
below

  hold that light sarg the straight-
ening figure of gus at the ladder foot
lifted to shout i dropped mine com-
ing down theres somebody down


the shadow magazine

here all right just knocked me off my
pins

  a minute and guss flat-nosed face
was bathed in that light at the scuttle
opening that chink saw sumpin
move down here and bolted for it gus
shouted up in explanation whoever
it was took a pass at me when i dropped
my light hes still down here i took
a couple of shots at the ladder there so
he wouldnt make a break that way
the sergeant was already descend-
ing spotted the chinaman on deck
the sergeant grunted in reply streak-
in it ford you sure you got em cor-
nered down here

   couldntve got out without stoppin
some lead guss voice trailed suspi-
ciously low that vent in the back
there is the only other opening too

small for a man mustve-

  from the scuttle top above sammy
watched the sweep of the flashlight
beams below

  below the two officers combed the
compartment in through stacked rows
of stores they searched a minute
passed suddenly the boom of the ser-
geants disgusted voice sounded up from
below

  say what the hells the matter
aboard here it bawled you goin
nuts too this place is emptys your
head

  by gosh there was sumpin down
there knocked me over gus was mum-
bling as up the scuttle ladder he trailed
the sergeant into the galley i dropped
my light just when i hit bottom there
and sumpin dived between my legs like

a greased hog i-

  nuts the sergeant barked you
tripped over your damn big feet say
you seein devils too get ford there
before i wrap sumpin around that

man and bring him aft on to the poop
theres a dead guy back there all right
skipper of the tub looks like well find
out from the chinaman for sure then

you and mac slide into headquarters and
get the coroner get goin

  mumbling to himself gus started
forward

  the sergeant paused outside the gal-
ley a moment to sweep his light about
then again started aft sammy at his
side

  the whole lot of youre goin
screwy the sergeant scolded as they
climbed to the poop the chinaman
you and now gus if- i didnt know
that swede id say he was half scared

  still grumbling the sergeant crossed
the poop and descended through the
hatch to the companion way below
sammy followed

  the heaped body still lay at the lad-
der foot it reeked a ghastly forebod-
ing to the grim shadowed passageway
sammy stepped across it to reach the
sergeants side

  the sergeant stood in a bent pose
staring down sammy followed the
sweep of his light beam along the com-
panionway deck again he felt a queer
uneasiness grip him

  there upon the gray-white deck a
trail of black wetness followed the
coaming line forward as if some one
had dragged a wet mop along the deck
baseboard forward it ran-forward
toward the open chart-room door at the
companionway end

  the sergeants light swung to follow
the black watery trail his jaws set

  that track wasnt there a few min-
utes ago he mumbled more to himself
than to sammy now what the-

  the sergeant moved forward step
by step he followed the wet trail for-
ward along the deck it ran to lift itself
and cross the chart-room coaming the
sergeant touched his fingers to the coam-
ing brass plate it was wet beyond
the trail again showed plain across
the chart room it streaked beneath the
chart table

  the sergeant bent to peer beneath the
the shadow magazine



table a low grunt of surprise escaped
his lips the watery trail crossed be-
neath the chart table to abruptly dis-
appear over the edge of the still-open
manhole leading to the bilge wells be-
low

  moving to the manhole edge the
sergeant turned his light down the
musty tang of bilge stench lifted to
greet him a dead quiet echoed from
below the sergeant bent lower ex-
tending his arm down through the man-
hole he played his light about

  suddenly he dropped to his hands and
knees his head and shoulders cut the
reflected light from below as he pushed
them through the manhole opening a
minute-and with lift of his body erect
a queer puzzled blankness masked his
features mouth agape he stared up at
sammy

  by gosh you was right kid he
whizzed in an awed gasp there was
sumpin below there looks like an-
other stiff take a look its wedged
over there against the transom beams
you can see his head and hands

  the sergeant handed sammy his
light

  sammy dropped flat and lowering his
head and shoulders through the man-
hole swept the light about the flesh
along his back tingled below the light
rays caught and reflected upon the
scummy slick of bilge water

   there a few feet back from the tran-
som beams the half-submerged body of
a man lay wedged againt the bilge
stringers a distorted body with head
and shoulders above the glistening scum

  sammy pulled himself erect the
lift of the light in his hand reflected
the sounding rod and line propped
against the bulkhead

  the sight of the rods stout line
caused the sergeant to step quickly for-
ward here he snapped at sammy
picking up rod and line ill go below
and make the line fast well hoist him

up the poor devil may have just got
it down there that couldve been his
track leading up the companionway

that or-

   the sergeant silenced his own words as
grunting laboriously he lowered himself
feet first through the manhole down
he sank-down until his feet evidently
securing a footing on the stringers be-
low he carefully drew his head and
shoulders below the deck level

   all right lad came the muffled in-
structions from below steady that
line out

  obediently sammy knelt alongside
the manhole and allowed the sounding-
rod line to run through his fingers

  below the sergeant crawled cau-
tiously across the stringer braces his
light playing upon the gruesome object
ahead

  in the chart room only the dull re-
flected glow from below dimmed the
surrounding blackness an intense si-
lence from above blended with the puff-
ing pants of the sergeant below

  dead as a mackerel came the ser-
geants hollow shout as he reached the
wedged body must be the guy joe
the chinaman was talkin bout waitll
i make this line fast then tug im your
way

  sammy bent lower to watch the ser-
geant work the body seemed as bone-
less as the one lying at the companion-
way end making the line fast was no
easy task the sergeant puffed and
tugged the body seemed caught se-
cure in the stringer bracing sammy
shuttered involuntarily as the water-
soaked clothing gave and allowed the
dead mans head to drop back

   the ghastly contorted features of the
man showed plain in the flashlight beam
purple-stained features-stained with
the congestion of strangulation eyes
popped in a ghoul-like death staxe

  sammy made to ease his position at
the manhole his upward shifted
glance caught the grotesque shadow of


the shadow magazine

his own crouched form upon the bulk-
head the wrapped darkness seemed to
press about him a morbid sense of
danger gripped him it seemed poised
in the blackness about

  sammy stiffened himself with a flare
of disgust stiffened then tensed alert
his ear had caught a familiar sound
a warning sound a soft steady
scrape a scrape such as he had heard
once before there above that manhole
a scrape as of canvas being dragged
across rough timbers dragged but this
time not below him the sound came
from the darkness at his back

  sammy quickly whirled whirled and
choked at the muffled cry of terror that
sputtered in his throat terror that
froze him still then jerked him erect in
a frantic leap backward

  his one hand clutched at the chart-
room table cold steel steadied his trem-
bling finger tips recognization to the
touch flashed the galley cleaver he
had left there on his first trip below
sammy groped for the weapons handle
he gripped it secure-gripped it and
backed further toward the bulkhead

  the glowing disk of light reflected
up through the deck manhole barely
tinted the blackness about the shad-
ows crowded now phantom and ghost-
like in the weaving gloom the chart-
room door was slowly swinging back
a frame of ebony outlined in its widen-
ing wake black ebony vacant save for
two swaying disks of flame that caught
the yellow reflected glow from below
deck and amplified it into the glare of
two blazing balls of agate

  higher they raised forward they
weaved eyes piercing ghoul-like eyes
swaying and swinging swinging in
the instant to lunge forward like a
charging demon out of hell charging
and hissing a sputtering hiss that
stifled the scream in sammys throat

 sammy made to leap aside the
chart table trapped him he dropped to

a crouch the lunging monster raised
to his crouched level sammys one arm
raised in an instinctive shield of de-
fense the hand gripping the cleaver
poised back a warning shrieked with-
in him the heavy cleaver slashed
down slashed to bury deep in squirm-
ing flesh that yielded gripped then
twisted with the strength of a phantom
giant so that the weapon was released

  an unseen arm lashed about his
chest sammy felt himself bowled back-
ward to land upon a second cushioning
arm that caught his tumbling body and
jerked it forward he felt himself
lifted lifted and pulled down as the
wrapping folds about him began to
tighten tighten as into the shaft of
light reflected up from the deck man-
hole a great square head shook itself in
the light stream to spray the yellowness
with a shower of blood

  blood that spurted from a gapping
split in the head center a split between
two angry eyes that glared pain mad-
dened in fury of the wound his slash-
ing cleaver had opened a wound deep
and wide deep in the skull of a
monstrous snake a great king python
with body round as a cargo boom head
big as a cat block

  side to side in its poise above sammy
the great head swayed the monster
seemed blinded by the blood from its
own wound crazed with its pain pain
that lashed anew as tugging his one
arm free sammy again slashed down
with his cleaver the pythons great
tail lashed destruction about the chart
room wildly sammy chopped to
sever the creeping coil ever sliding
higher about his body he fought to
regain his feet a second sliding wrap
of surging flesh was creeping about him
the weight held him down the coils
were tightening-constricting

  sammy slashed the cleaver blade past
his very throat a rip of flesh seemed
to give sammys fingers clawed for
grip
the shadow magazine



  the swaying head above him arched
back arched-lunged-then twisted
wildly in a plunge across the deck

  sammys shoulders hit the bulkhead
the blow dazed him he relaxed his
grip on the cleaver feebly he clawed
to retrieve it but the weapon slid from
his finger tips the wrapped coils about
him tightened to roll him deeper into a
third wrapping fold

  the roar of slipping consciousness
pounded through sammys brain a
sting of numbness tingled through his
body to his finger ends-to the surging
pulse of his juglar creeping numbness
that slipped him beneath a phantom veil
a veil of crushing destruction-scream-
ing voices-flashing glares-ghoul-like
visions

  a screaming form seemed to vault
from the very deck and like some wild
savage decked in a glistening shield of
white lunge forward with poised
spear gleaming its lance-point threat

  then out of the blackness a second
savagelike form burst as from nowhere
swinging a barbaric battle-ax above his
head-screaming as it lashed down

  visions all broken and distorted in
the screams and chaos about screams
that snapped sammy back to conscious-
ness at the very moment his benumbed
brain crooned death as a release to the
horror of it all

  dimly sammy heard voices low in
the sudden calm he felt the shock of
cold water to his face he opened his
eyes a white-coated form was bend-
ing over him a second grotesque form
stood alongside dimly sammy fum-
bled to recognize them the sergeant
and gus both were standing over him

  the sergeant lifted him gently
sammy swayed as he found his feet
his breath was jerky

  you hurt lad anything smashed
the sergeants voice held a soothing
note

  sammy shook his head guess-

guess not he managed to say where

-where is-

  sammys eyes caught a heaped mass
of yellow coils blood-spattered and
spotted against the bulkhead its
great head hung pinned fast with the
lancelike sounding rod the fire ax in
guss hand explained the rest the
veiled visions of a moment before
dawned clear the sergeant and gus
had arrived just in time

  still swaying sammy shook off the
sergeants supporting arm whered
the devil come from he managed to
speak i-i didnt see him until he
came through the door

  we followed that water track the
wrong way lad the sergeant offered
hes what gus bumped into ford at
the galley the thing mustve crawled
through the vent while gus was huntin
for his light and then come up through
the manhole there to hide out in one of
those cabins we left open aft gus
saw the thing in the companionway when
he went to bring the chinaman down
he run for an ax to tackle it with but
between times it damn near got you
yeah yeah sammy risked
weakly that chink was right about
his devil what-wheres he

  cuffed to the wheel topside gus
broke in with his mumble the
heathen sap if hed told us when we
come aboard wed knowd what to look
for this tub just come in from sin-
gapore with a zoo load of them foreign
animals and snakes this baby mustve
got loose and they figured he went over

the side i never seen-

  sammy had suddenly straightened
his eyes caught a new glow he
glanced at his wrist watch the hand
reached out to grab the sergeant

  hey sarg sammy rattled off
breathlessly it isnt eleven yet i got
time to beat the dead line send gus
in so i can grab a phone and get this
to the boss in time for the first-star
edition its the hottest yarn since-


the shadow magazine

  twenty minutes later sammy had
the city desk got a hot one boss he
babbled over the dock telephone lower
bay anchorage its a snake yarn

the barkentine-

  sammys voice went quiet twice he
made to speak but each time some com-
manding word at the wires opposite end
seemed to silence him each time
sammys face went a trifle redder
when finally he spoke his tone was meek
and submissive

  yes sir yes sir his voice carried
from the dock booth the black cat
club ill get right up there sir yes
sir im on my way

  sammy replaced the receiver upon its
hook he turned to meet the inquiring
stare of gus

  too late gus mumbled sympa-
thetically

  too late hell sammy exploded
did you hear what he told me told
me i was seeing snakes to-to

say wheres the black cat club 
they just raided it and the boss wants
names and numbers be a good scout
gus get the central operator on the
phone and locate it for me while i page
a taxi this may be a hot yarn after
all those society punks always make
good copy hurry it will you gus
solemnly gus turned to the telephone
as sammy went racing up the dock ap-
proach once his head shook gravely
from side to side as he did so his eye
caught that of macs the engineman
making toward him

  screwy gus mumbled jerking
a thumb toward the disappearing
sammy beefin all night bout sump-

in to write about and now-

  mac had passed without seeming to
even hear gus shook his head sol-
emnly again screwy he spoke aloud
then as the receiver at his ear clicked
he hastened to apologize the central
operator seemed to understand

mounties and motors

        civilization seems to be encroaching on one of the last out-
    posts of police frontier-the canadian northwest where the
    mountie holds sway over thousands of miles of wild unsettled
    country the mountie is slowly but surely relinquishing his
    famous horse and taking to modern inventions-the automobile
    and the airplane

        in days past when the northwest had but few settlers in its
    vast expanse the mounties could cover their beats with horses
    but to-day with so many gold camps being opened and many
    people settling on the frontier as a permanent home site the
    mountie has need for quicker means to make his rounds and as
    more and more roads are being built he turns from his horse to the
    automobile to cover some of the barren land of the far north
    he resorts to the air-covering in a few hours with a plane that
    which would have taken him months with a horse or dog team

        however in some parts of the northwest it is not feasible to
    use either planes or automobiles then the mountie turns to his
    old stand-bys-the canoe or boat in summer and the dog team in
    winter

by harly james

  detective dan connolly idly drew
figures on a scratch pad as the police
commissioner was talking not bad
figures either for dan had a natural
flair for drawing in fact had his
family been possessed of sufficient
funds danny would have been sent to
art school in his earlier years instead
economic necessity had sent him to the
police force where in the short space
of five years dan had become one of
the most valued members of the detec-
tive force

  this case isnt going to be made
public for some time said commis-
sioner grayson it would give the
museum authorities a black eye more
or less to have it known that two of

their most valuable paintings had been
stolen less than a year after the museum
was built and opened another reason

is that it would-

  attract the attention of a lot of rich
men who have wanted those paintings
for themselves and who wouldnt hesi-
tate to put their money to work and
try to get them back-for their own
private collections interrupted dan
yeah i know that gag its been done
several times in the past

  old silas bronson as a final gesture
of distaste for his few remaining rela-
tives had willed his rather substantial
fortune to a board of trustees with in-
structions that an art museum bearing
his name was to be erected it was to

i


the shadow magazine

house his own private collections of
paintings antique jewelry and other
valuable works of art

  other items of art were to be pur-
chased from time to time by the
trustees and to show his further dis-
trust of all mankind old bronson di-
rected that the trustees were to serve
without pay their reward would be in
the credit that would come from ac-
cumulating an outstanding collection of
art warks the actual handling of the
money was to be done by a firm of pub-
lic accountants no firm was to act in
such capacity for more than one year
and all of the accounts were to be re-
viewed by the orphans court

  old bronson seemed to love his
neighbors a whole lot less than he loved
himself was dans caustic comment
when that information had been outlined
to him

  the only thing he loved replied
grayson was art and hed turn over
in his grave if he knew that two of his
prize possessions had disappeared from
his collection

  the two pictures one a famous tin-
toretto and the other an equally fa-
mous murillo had been cut from their
frames and removed from the bronson
museum

  the imposing building which housed
the valuable pieces had been erected a
little over a year before it was the last
word in the modern style of architec-
ture two and a half stories in height
with perfectly smooth walls of concrete
blocks hand plastered and every angle
worked to a smooth roundness that was
a delight to an artisans eye all win-
dows facing the outer world were barred
with artistic but practical grilling set in
the masonry the removal of the
grilles was impossible short of blast-
ing

  the building was in the form of a
quadrangle and possessed an inner
court laid out in a miniature imitation
of the palace at versailles france en-

trance to the court was had by doors in
the inner walls of the building

  there were fewer windows cut into
this inside wall thus allowing wall
space for the hanging of the larger
paintings none of these windows were
barred thus giving a means of removing
at least somt of the art treasures in case
of fire

  the robbery had been reported that
morning by the curator of the museum
and commissioner grayson had in-
stantly recognized the fact that here was
a delicate case-one which would re-
quire his most skilled men to solve

   picture thieves were a clever lot the
stealing and disposal of old masters was
not a thing to be handled by amateur
brains for the simple reason that the
ownership of all the known works of
the worlds great artists was a matter of
common knowledge any attempt to
sell a stolen old master would result in
instant arrest for the would-be seller

  but grayson also knew that there
were many rich men who from one mo-
tive or another desired certain paint-
ings true such paintings if unlaw-
fully acquired could never be shown to
any one they must always remain hid-
den away with only their new possessor
to view them

  vanity was usually the prime motive
in such transactions jealousy too was
a motive as was also the idea of having
gotten ahead of some possible com-
petitor for the possession of certain
paintings

  dan connolly was also aware of these
facts but just now his job was to look
over the layout in an effort to discover
how the robbery had been effected why
it had been committed would come later

   the recovery of the paintings and the
arrest of the thief were more important
at this stage of the game than were the
reasons for the robbery a strict ad-
herence to this principle had been re-
sponsible for dans rapid rise on the
the shadow magazine



force get the crook-then get the rea-
sons for his crime

  arriving at the bronson museum
dan was shown at once into the office of
murchison the curator

  murchison was a short slender man
immaculate in dress nervous of manner
and at the moment apparently in a
state verging on mental collapse he
seemed quite worried

  he answered dans questions at such
length and with so much immaterial in-
formation that dan was almost at a loss
to separate the wheat from the chaff
hed have to do his own investigating
anyway so he decided to let murchison
get it off his chest and then start anew
on his own hook

  and now said dan eager to get
away and begin his investigation i
dont suppose youve any objections to
my roaming about a bit alone i
mean 

  why no replied murchison cer-
tainly not of course there are the
watchmen you know they dont know
you or your object and they might-

  ill take care of them all right said
dan rising and walking toward the
door then he stepped into the corri-
dor closing the office door behind him

  whew he said to himself id
hate to give that bird the third degree
hed have the police talking to them-
selves in less than no time

  he proceeded to the stairway leading
to the second floor of the museum
which had been the scene of the crime
a few moments later he was before the
spot where the stolen paintings had been
hanging the empty frames stared down
at him from their places on the wall
which was well out of reach of any hu-
man without the aid of a chair or a
ladder

  one of the museum watchmen was on
duty there now that the pictures have
been stolen was dans half-humorous
thought

  dan connolly established his identity

with the watchman whose name was
berger

  well mused dan nobody could
have reached those pictures without the
aid of a chair or a ladder could they

  no sir replied berger they
could not thats a fact

  and since they had to have a chair
or a ladder there wouldnt be much
chance of doing the job during the reg-
ular visiting hours would there
asked dan

  not a chance replied berger swell-
ing with importance at being consulted
by a detective especially as theres a
watchman goes through every corridor
once every ten minutes

  ten minutes dan smiled grimly to
himself granting that a crook would
be free from interruption there was no
reason in the world why such a job
could not be executed in three minutes

  all the thief needed was some sort of
platform a sharp knife then a few
quick accurate slashes with a knife and
the pictureswere his but the matter of
a clean get-away was something else
there was no possible guarantee of not
being interrupted during the visiting
hours

  and that decided dan is a sure
sign that it was an after-hours job no
picture thief is going to take a chance
he doesnt have to take this was a
night job sure as shooting

  before entering the museum dan
connolly had done a bit of scouting out-
side but beyond the self-evident fact
that the museum had been placed within
an inclosure of stately lombardy pop-
lar trees and was further protected
from marauders by a high iron fence of
forbidding appearance set about a dozen
feet distant from the building he had
discovered nothing

  dan sat down on one of the uphol-
stered and massive benches which were
placed at regular intervals for the com-
fort of visitors


the shadow magazine

  now mused dan if some hefty
guy should happen to lug one of these
benches over to the wall he could easily
reach those frames

  he arose and attempted to move the
bench he discovered that he might as
well try to move the rock of gibraltar
the bench was bolted fast and could
not be moved

  all these benches bolted down he
asked of berger

  yes indeed if they werent peo-
ple would be dragging them all over
youve no idea some of the fool things
people do in art museums replied
berger

  no i guess not said dan then
he lapsed once more into thought

  it was impossible for any one to
force an entrance at any of the win-
dows the main entrance murchison
had told him was guarded day and
night by watchmen who had been re-
cruited from a bonding company no
question as to their integrity

  nope reflected dan not much
use investigating them except just in
the line of duty this is beginning to
look like an inside job though at that
if thats the case the chances are that
those paintings are still in the building
waiting for the crook to come back and
pick them up after hes got everything
planned to get them out

  this idea struck dan with such force
that he once more went to murchisons
office where a light of hope sprang in
the curators eyes when dan put the
idea to him

  well be closing in a little while
said murchison well search every
inch of the place

  dan mentally calculated the size of
the place to make a real search would
require quite a force if they hoped to
finish before darkness came on just
the same it might lead to something so
dan sat back and waited for the closing
hour

  he was surprised at the turnout of

museum employees who assembled be-
fore him when the main entrance had
been closed upon the last departing vis-
itors

  the latter had submitted in fairly
good humor to a perfunctory frisking
when the situation had been explained
to them

  dan issued his instructions tersely to
the employees who numbered almost
fifty in all they were to work in pairs
and they were to take one floor one cor-
ridor one room at a time

  if any employee was in on the job
this was an effective method of pre-
venting the carrying away of the paint-
ings-if they were found in the build-
ing

  never had any place experienced such
a thorough searching as the bronson
museum two hours after the inspec-
tion had been started there was not a
square inch of the building which had
not been investigated even the coal
pile in the basement had been moved
and sifted the paintings were not in
the building

  murchison was more disconsolate
than ever

  it is terrible he wailed my repu-
tation will be ruirfed ill be the laugh-
ingstock of the art world and what
is worse ill never be able to get an-
other position until the paintings have
been recovered

  well if its any consolation to you
said dan you can think over the fact
that they havent gone far they
havent had time ill be seeing you
to-morrow maybe well have some-
thing to work on by that time

  i hope so said murchison fer-
vently

  dan returned to headquarters and
spent several hours in idly running over
the police-card index of picture thieves
then he turned his attention to the gal-
lery photographs of these personages
and studied them carefully hed re-
the shadow magazine



member these fellows if he ever saw any
of them

  but spring was in the air and dan
could not concentrate on the dry-as-dust
cards in front of him listening to
murchisons near-wailing had not
done anything better than weary him

  a movie or something is what i
need said dan to himself then a
good nights sleep and maybe i can get
somewhere on this case-providing i
can keep murchisons tongue from wag-
ging too much that fellow ought to
be a radio announcer or something

  the detective opened a newspaper
and searched the amusement ads

  now there said dan no movies
for me to-night not when theres a cir-
cus in town it wont hurt anybody to
turn into a kid again for a night

  so the greatest show on earth was
enriched by the price of dans ad-
mission he entered whole-heartedly
into the circus spirit and enjoyed him-
self as much as any youngster who was
there

  and now ladeez an gentlemen
came the stentorian tones of the master
of ceremonies i take pleasure in intro-
ducin to you the great lassiter the
worlds foremost fiyin trapeze artist
in his death-defyin routine ladeez
and gentlemen the great lassiter will
show you things that will open your
eyes youll watch him in fear and
trembling but the great lassiter
wont be trembling he doesnt know
the meaning of fear ladeez and gen-
tlemen the great lassiter

  with a grandiloquent bow and a ma-
jestic sweep of his arm and amidst the
crescendo blare of the brass band the
master of ceremonies indicated a per-
former who was now entering the ring
from the dressing tent

  tall lithe dark-haired thin of face
the great lassiter strode to the center
of the ring bowing to the salvo of ap-
plause which greeted him

  an instant later the great lassiter

was ascending a rope ladder which hung
from a trapeze close to the roof of the
main tent while the audience watched
with bated breath to most of them
even this much was a daring undertak-
ing what with the rope ladder swaying
under the weight and motion of his
body

  then the rope ladder came hurtling to
the tanbark

  the great lassiter was perched on
his trapeze facing another trapeze lo-
cated some forty feet distant then the
acrobat uncoiled a rope perhaps fifteen
feet in length from the bar of the
trapeze he fastened one end of the
rope to the crossbar held on to the
other end-and jumped a second later
he was dangling high above the heads
of the audience he began gathering
momentum back and forth then-

 there were shrieks from women
spectators shouts and groans from ex-
citable men and youngsters  the great
lassiter was sailing through the air
headed for the distant trapeze thun-
derous applause greeted him as he
grasped the crossbar and pulled himself
up erect

  and believe me said dan to him-
self thats some stunt and so it
was

  many performers worked the same
trick from trapeze to trapeze-but not
from the end of a rope that was las-
siters own trick no others cared to
attempt it

  the guys got nerve said dan
and he got another thrill as the great
lassiter repeated the trick back to the
first trapeze the trapeze was lowered
toward the tanbark amid tumultuous
applause

  the great lassiter smiled and bowed
his thanks and turned toward the dress-
ing tent and in that instant dan con-
nolly thought he was dreaming

  ive seen that guy before muttered
dan but where  id know that face
-but where have i seen it


the shadow magazine

  he lost interest in the performance
something was tugging at the back of
his mind-something that demanded ex-
planation but none came dan con-
nolly went home and spent a night filled
with dreams of flying ropes and trapeze
artists

  in the morning dan went to head-
quarters once more again he took out
the card index and photographs he had
consulted the day before suddenly an
exclamation was torn from his lips

  thats it he said aloud thats
it in his hand he held the photograph
of a dark-haired thin-faced man bear-
ing the caption edward lassen age
 held for complicity in theft of
valuable paintings from norriton mu-
seum  convicted and served one year

  quickly dan connolly dug up the
card index on lassen who was none
other than the great lassiter he had
seen the night before the details on
the card were illuminating

  lassen had been a ranch hand years
before was an expert with the lasso
and had acquired somewhat of a repu-
tation as an acrobat and trick horse
rider

  his record was blank for several
years after leaving the ranch then he
had turned up in bad company in chi-
cago had left town and joined a cir-
cus then came his arrest and convic-
tion in the norriton museum case

  then came another blank to be fol-
lowed by the information that lassen
was again arrested in connection with a
theft of old masters but this time
escaped conviction then he had joined
the greatest show on earth here the
record ended

  but maybe mused dan therell
be more to add to that

  he made known his suspicions to
commissioner grayson but that per-
sonage advised him not to jump at con-
clusions-the great lassiter might not
be the man wanted

  maybe he isnt  agreed dan but
the fact that the robbery was pulled off
during circus week plus the fact that a
known picture thief is with the circus
makes a pretty good circumstantial
case

  yes it does admitted grayson
but we cant have any slip-up weve
got to have real evidence-and weve
got to get the pictures back

  im going out now to get the evi-
dence said dan about the pictures
im not so sure

  well good luck to you was gray-
sons remark as dan left the commis-
sioners office

  connolly proceeded to the bronson
museum this time he did not enter
the building but spent his time walking
about the plot on which it was located
taking in all the details and endeavoring
to create a picture in his mind as to how
the museum could have been entered by
the thief

  dans eyes mildly inspected the row
of lombardy poplars they were in-
terspersed here and there with enor-
mous sturdy oaks which had been per-
mitted to remain as a mark of respect to
natures great handicraft

  dan noted that practically all of the
trees were higher than the museum
building itself then one o the thick
far-reaching branches of an oak tree at-
tracted his attention

  the oak tree disappeared from his
vision replaced by a vision of a trapeze
high in the tent of the circus a dangling
rope and a swaying man-the swaying
man flying through space to another
distant trapeze

  if lassiter pulled the trick theres
the answer said dan enthusiastically
he used the oak tree for a trapeze
and a pretty long rope sos he wouldnt
have too dangerous a landing to make
on the roof then he must have
crawled over to one of the windows
opening on the court that must be it
the shadow magazine



  he hurried inside the building and
up to the second floor berger the
watchman was again on duty there

  good morning sir said berger
on the trail

  i think so replied dan know
anything about those windows he
pointed to a window on each side of the
space where the paintings had hung
were they locked the night before the
robbery 

  positively replied berger theres
a little gadget on each window that
throws on a red light in the office when
the lock is closed thats checked up by
mr murchison and none of the em-
ployees can leave if any of the windows
dont show a red light when every-
thing is o k they throw off the
switch until next day

  fine said dan and how about
the next morning

  i discovered the robbery sir and
rushed right down to mr murchison
he came up with some of his assistants
and everybody was running around like
wild

  did any of them open the window 
mr murchison did replied berger
then suddenly say-thats funny i
was right beside him when he opened it
--and he didnt unsnap the catch when
he pushed it up

  just what i thought barked dan
he went swiftly to the window indi-
cated by berger threw it up and an in-
stant later was perched outside on the
rather deep recess he instantly per-
ceived that the window had been jim-
mied

  he came inside once more but said
nothing to berger of his discovery

  stupid fools he thought-himself in-
cluded why hadnt some one thought
of the inside windows yesterday he
must be getting old to slip up on a
thing like that

  well there was nothing more to be
done here so dan made his way to the
circus grounds once more

  it was several hours before the
matinee performance was due to take
place and dan walked unhindered about
the lot he stopped one of the roust-
abouts and asked the location of las-
siters dressing tent

  outside the entrance to lassiters tent
dan found a sporty-looking individual
lounging idly smoking a long black
cigar

  im looking for the great lassiter
said dan is this his tent

  yeah replied the sporty-looking
individual im lookin for him my-
self anything i can do for you
just want a little dope about him
replied dan i anta give him a little
write-up

  oh newspaper guy said the other
thats o k youve hit the right fel-
low im potter publicity agent for
the show cmon in

  they went inside the tent and sat
down on a couple of wooden folding
chairs and before dan could ask any
questions the publicity agent was mak-
ing his spiel

  the usual routine stuff dan noted
as he made meaningless marks on the
back of an envelope so as to keep up
with the newspaperman idea which pot-
ter had hung on him

  the detectives keen eyes made a co-
vert but searching scrutiny of the tent
interior there was but a single place
where any pictures might be hidden
and that was in the performers trunk
the lid of which was raised and the
contents strewn helter-skelter about the
sawdust floor the trunk dan saw
was absolutely empty

  potter noted the detectives glance at
the strewn garments

  just like that guy said the publicity
man rising and beginning to throw the
articles back into the trunk sloppiest
dresser on the lot

  dan realized that nothing was hid-
den in the performers costumes which
consisted of tights thin silk trunks and


the shadow magazine

blouses and other articles which could
not possibly conceal the missing pic-
tures

  what im after said dan is some-
thing unusual has he any hobbies any
superstitions or anything like that

  well replied potter slowly yes
he has

  he went to the drawer of a rickety
dressing table and pulled out a shallow
drawer dan watching intently all the
time

   potter lifted several sheets of artists
board from the drawer on them the
great lassiter had made several very
creditable copies of old masters in char-
coal

  hes doing this kind of stuff all the
time said potter these two he must
have made last night after the show
he held up two sheets of board

  dan gasped they were charcoal
sketches of the missing tintoretto and
murillo he had been shown photo-
graphs of the masterpieces and recog-
nized them instantly so he was on the
right track

  but about superstitions went on
potter i guess he aint got any hes
got nerves of steel except maybe one
thing-he dont trust anybody to put
up and take down his trapeze always
does that himself says if anything
happens itll be his own fault now
that i think of it he raised hell last
night after the show when one of the
clearers began to let down one of the
darned things

  swell said dan certain now that
he had located the man he wanted got
to be going now ill stop back after
the show this afternoon id like to
talk to him personally

  o k with me said potter i
gotta be goin myself now little work
in the next town we hit

  dan was glad for this break he didnt
want any one to tell lassiter that a vis-
itor had called-or that the visitor would
return

  together the detective and the pub-
licity man left the circus grounds

  dan connolly was right on deck
after the matinee performance in fact
he was waiting for the great lassiter
when the latter entered the dressing
tent from the ring

  whats the idea asked lassiter as
he spotted dan

  just a little confab replied dan
i was here this morning with potter-
a little publicity stuff you know

  oh lassiter looked his visitor
over carefully just a minute i got
to inspect my trapeze he turned and
left the tent

  dan followed him into the big top he
thought it rather suspicious that the man
should speak a few words and then
make an excuse to leave the dressing
tent maybe it was a get-away that
would never do

  the greater lassiter walked quickly
to the rope ladder and began to ascend
dan watched him as he climbed the
dizzy heights

  well thats something i wouldnt
do unless i had to said dan to an at-
tendant who was standing near by

  oh its not so bad after you get used
to it said the attendant lassiter
dont give a hoot about anything like
that hes more apt to throw a fit if a
speck of grease or something gets on
those sacred trapeze of his

  dont want anybody to touch em
eh asked dan

  wont let em replied the attend-
ant not if he sees em first hell
raise hell when he gets up there and
finds they were switched on him before
the show

  how was that asked the detec-
tive

  oh the canvas men had to make
some repairs up there before the
matinee and the trapeze had to be low-
ered before they could do it lassiter
didnt notice the switch on account of

shad- a
the shadow magazine



the natural excitement during a show
but he will in a minute

  how can he tell theyre exactly
alike arent they asked dan

  yeah-all but the crossbars ones
solid and the other bars hollow that
trapeze hes climbin to now has the
solid crossbar it oughta be the hollow
one there im beatin it before he gets
an idea i made the swntch the at-
tendant left the ring in haste

  dan looked after the man specula-
tively huh this lassiter must be a
tough egg when he gets going he re-
flected then suddenly great guns
maybe-

  the detective broke off his sentence
in a moment he was headed for the
other trapeze then he was slowly
ascending the rope ladder which hung
by it

  the great lassiter was evidently in a
towering rage he had discovered the
switching of the trapeze and now was
apparently addressing the wide world
about it but his back was toward dan

  as dan reached the little wooden plat-
form which afforded a resting place for
a trapeze performer the great lassiter
turned and dan gazing across the in-
tervening space could see the acrobats
face go pale

  lassiter motioned frantically for the
detective to descend but dan paid no
attention the detective was not used
to such heights and scant support and
he was plenty dizzy not to say squeam-
ish around the stomach every move-
ment was dangerous for him the slight-
est misstep meant that he would be
dashed to the ring below a drop of at
least seventy-five feet

  carefully dan eased himself down so
that he was in position to examine the
crossbar with his penknife he struck
a sharp blow on the bar it gave forth
a dull clank

  get the hell away from that trapeze
get down  came the command of las-
siter shrieking from the other trapeze
shad-a

  then before dan was fully aware of
what was happening lassiter had fast-
ened his length of rope to the crossbar
taken hold of the end and dropped
dangled for a moment and then began
to gather momentum he was going to
do his act before an audience of one

  apparently lassiter cared nothing
that dan might be an enemy and swing
the trapeze out of his reach as he let
go of the rope and flew through space

  but dan could not do that if las-
siter were killed dan would be re-
sponsible

  there was a jarring and swaying of
the trapeze stand the great lassiter
had made his landing and drawn himself
up

  dan drew himself erect on the little
platform and took a firm grip one
brawny arm around a wooden post the
other ready for any emergency that
might arise

  get down out of there hissed las-
siter

  sure agreed dan id like to-
but i aint going until i get whats in-
side that crossbar

  theres nothing in it barked las-
siter

  youre a liar calmly stated dan
it dont ring clear im thinking
theres a couple of paintings in there

  youre crazy said the circus per-
former what would paintings be do-
ing in there

  i dont know replied dan they
shouldnt be there thats true and if
they are im takin them away with me
and you too im detective connolly
from headquarters

  youre a fool yelled lassiter

  shut up this is no place for an
argument an-

  suddenly twisting one arm around
one of the suspension ropes lassiter
lashed out with other at dan con-
nolly

  dan ducking away nearly lost his
footing and his heart came thumping


the shajqw magazine

up into his throat the breath seemed
to leave his body but he had no time
for thought for lassiter struck out
again

  dan leaned forward as far as he
could and with his free arm took a shot
at the desperate man the blow struck
lightly on lassiters arm

  for a minute the two men battled
their one-handed fight high above the
tanbark where an instants loss of their
grip or footing meant hurtling to cer-
tain death below

  then dan managed to put in a crack
to the jaw which staggered lassiter

  the circus performer loosed his hold
on the suspension rope and moved to
the far end of the crossbar out of frans
reach there he glared madly at the
detective his breath coming in short
quick gasps that fairly hissed to dan
the glittering eyes of lassiter and his
hissing breath seemed like a den of
venomous snakes then lassiters head
began to sway slightly

  just like a snake getting ready to
strike thought dan and im think-
ing-

  but dan never finished that thought

  through the slight space that sep-
arated them the body of lassiter came
hurtling in one swift leap arms out-
stretched to envelop dan it was the
desperation of madness itself

  but it failed of its purpose for even
while lassiter was leaping through
space dans free arm cocked itself
muscles flexed then it flashed out
straight to the jaw of the desperate man

  as lassiters outflung arms draped
themselves over dans shoulders his
body went limp

  the free arm of dan connelly must
have been expecting that for it made a
frantic grab and encircled lassiter
about the waist as mingled shouts of
surprise and horror floated up from be-
low

  looking down dan saw a number of

circus employees craning their necks
shouting and gesticulating one of
them began to climb the rope ladder

  get back shouted dan get
ready to lower the trapeze

  the detective carefully braced him-
self with his awkward burden stuck out
one leg and snared one of the suspen-
sion ropes he managed to get this
twisted around his ankle as he had seen
aerial performers do and then heaved a
sigh of relief

  he knew that even if he made a mis-
play with his hands that the rope would
hold him tightly and that the more
weight he carried the tighter the hold
would be on that leg

  just the same he worked carefully
with his free arm and finally managed
to swing himself and his burden on the
crossbar

  lower away he shouted to those
below

  the trapeze began to descend slowly
to the ground

  a couple of minutes later dan con-
nolly was standing in the tanbark ring
looking up toward the top of the ridge-
poles carefully he wiped beads of
perspiration from his face

  phew he exclaimed and again
phew then he saw a police officer
whom some one had summoned

  officer said dan take that-in-
dicating the inert lassiter-to head-
quarters to the commissioners office
then opening his pocketknife he began
cutting the ropes of the trapeze

  since i went to ail that trouble to get
this i might as well take it along with
me he picked up the crossbar and
left the tent

  commissioner grayson listened qui-
etly as dan connolly made his report

  like i thought chief this lassiter
used the branches of an oak tree just
like he did his act in the circus he
got a good swinging start and the
let go landing on the roof
the shadow magazine



  suppose he had missed  asked
grayson

  just too bad then replied dan
but that guys got nerve and he
didnt miss he crawled over the roof
eased himself down to the window re-
cess jimmied the window and in about
three minutes was making his way back
over the roof again with the stolen
paintings

  grayson interrupted but how did
he get off the roof thats a puzzler
no it aint really stated dan
when he made the first jump to the
roof of the museum he had another
rope wrapped areund him

  yes but what could he do with it
if he slid down to the ground the
chances were hed be seen

	sure he knew that but remember
this guy used to work on a cew ranch
he can chuck a lasso pretty swell an
thats what he did he corralled a
branch with the rope an when he was
sure it was tight he does another swing-
in act then he took both ropes away
with him simple then he went to
the circus tent and hid the paintings

  but where are they you said you
could produce them said grayson

  dan handed over the trapeze crossbar
poke a ruler in there he said care-
ful now-as the commissioner began
ramming a desk ruler through the hol-
low bar

  in a moment something protruded
from the opposite end of the bar gray-
son carefully drew it out the missing
tintoretto and murillo paintings stared
at him

  clever work dan complimented
grayson clever work who put this
lassiter on this job some rich man

  thats the funny part of it replied
dan i dont think anybody is in on
it lassiters a nut on art work s funny
how some peoples minds run im sure
he wanted them himself i wouldnt
give a dollar a piece for em myself

  grayson smiled

  well here he said keep the
crossbar for a souvenir or give it back
to the great lassiter

  he wont need it replied dan
hell have plenty of em for the next
few years

the death trap

 by robert n reeves

  detective sergeant john thorn-
ton drove the motor boat for several
miles along the bay shore where clumps
of stunted twisted trees grew distorted
into fantastic shapes under the moon-
light farther up the shore he saw a
tree larger than the rest gaunt and
dead that leaned out at an angle over
the water

  at the sight of it red lacey seated
in the bow became silent and alert

  slow her down he commanded

  detective thornton brought the boat
almost to a stop

  now nose her in there quick
ordered lacey

 thornton swerved the boat and
headed straight for the shore

  lacey his beaked nose thin lips and
inflexible jaw showing beneath his
slouch hat sat for several minutes in
the boat after the shore was reached
he looked up and down the beach and
inland toward the tall dark fringe of
redwoods several times he glanced at
his watch finally he picked up a
shovel and suitcase from the bottom of
the boat and leaped ashore in a hurried
manner

  you stay here till i get back he
gruffly commanded

  thornton his broad shoulders
hunched over his muscular hands grip-
ping the gunwales of the boat followed
with keen eyes the tall figure of his
man to hell with staying in the boal
the shadow magazine



hed jump out throw off his mask of
stupidity and go after lacey with a
gun if he made for the redwoods that
loomed in the distance

  not far from the shore behind some
naked brush lacey started to dig

  in the moonlight thornton could see
him plainly the detective settled back
against the stern of the boat there
was a broad smile on his face the
thought of having lacey digging there
amused him the fact that lacey was
hard-boiled and would not later submit
to arrest without a battle did not worry
thornton

  he had been in some hard battles with
desperate characters in his time most
of them were now behind steel bars
the smile of amusement lingered on
thorntons lips and this was the reason
of it

  some months before puddy madi-
gan and pal had held up a train on the
outskirts of san francisco and had
robbed the express messenger of fifty
thousand dollars in gold coin madigan
had been captured and sent to san
quentin prison for a ten-year stretch
not a coin of the stolen gold had been
recovered and the tight-lipped madigan
had refused to divulge the name of his
pal or tell what had become of the gold

  thornton assigned to the case had
learned that red lacey was the pal of
madigan on the night of the robbery
and that he had been the real instigator
of the crime

  unaware that he was suspected
lacey had hung around san francisco
seemingly supplied with ample funds
though making no great display of his
wealth

  in an obscure rooming house where
lacey lived thornton had rented a
room in the guise of a mechanic out
of a job he had managed to scrape a
nodding acquaintance with lacey but
that was all the wary lacey had
shown no inclination to be friendly until
that very morning

  he had come to thorntons room and
asked him what he knew about running
a motor boat when thornton told him
that he knew all about it a squint of
humor had come into laceys hard gray
eyes

  dont ask me who i am or what im
after he said i might be a lucky
miner from nevada or i might be a
sea captain that knows a bit of cali-
fornia history whats to the point is
that ive heard youre lookin for a job
and i want to give you one to help you
out

  together they had gone down to the
water front where lacey had advanced
the necessary money for thornton to
hire a speedy motor boat in the night
they had come across the bay to the
weird spot where thornton now sat in
the boat to search for treasure that
lacey claimed was buried there

  suddenly the smile faded from
thorntons lips he leaned far over in
the boat and watched lacey like a hawk
lacey had stopped digging and had
thrown aside his shovel

  thornton saw him light a cigarette
puff at it a moment then throw it side
only to light another one and repeat
the operation he glanced often to-
ward the redwoods as he paced back
and forth like a sentry walking a post

  from out of the redwoods a soft
whistle reached thorntons ears it
was answered by a similar one from
lacey

  then from the cover of the trees the
dark form of a man appeared he sped
across the level space that lay between
the redwoods and the spot where lacey
had been digging as he reached
laceys side he tore the clothes from his
back they were quickly replaced by
other clothes which lacey handed him
from the suitcase

  in a flash thornton realized what had
happened several miles up the coast
he remembered stretched a wilderness


the shadow magazine

of dune lands beyond which lay san
quentin prison

  puddy madigan had escaped lacey
had lied about the buried treasure
without knowing it he had used a de-
tective to aid in the escape of a con-
vict  the thought struck thornton like
a thunderbolt

  instead of one desperate man to deal
with he now had two and that was
not all suppose the prison guards or a
harbor police boat picked him up along
with lacey and madigan what a scan-
dal it would create the newspapers
the public even his fellow officers would
suspicion that he had been lured by
stolen gold to aid in the escape of a
convict and if he could not explain
matters convincingly to his chief he
would probably be subjected to criminal
prosecution

  for an instant thornton was on the
point of drawing his gun from his hol-
ster strapped up under his left armpit
but it was too late now besides the
words of his chief rang in his ears
find the gold then arrest lacey and
he had not yet found the gold

  madigan clothed in a dark suit and
carrying the shovel was coming toward
the boat lacey at his elbow was
carrying the suitcase each held a gun
in his free hand

  a good friend of mine volunteered
lacey as madigan stepped into the mo-
tor boat

  the lips of the convict twitched and
he grunted a surly greeting as he
glanced at thorntons overalls and at
his cap with its greasy visor

  get the boat out of here in a hurry
lacey commanded thornton huskily
hit straight for frisco and remem-
ber-no light and no siren

  thornton knew that wherever bound
it was going to be a hazardous trip for
him fraught with impending disaster
to his life and reputation but he was
ready to take a chance

  heeding laceys command he headed

the boat straight for san francisco
whose lights glimmered in the distance

  out in the middle of the bay lacey
tossed the shovel overboard then he
picked up the suitcase and it followed
the shovel sinking with the speed of a
plummet he glanced at thornton as
it disappeared but the detective seemed
intent only on the lights ahead of him
the act of lacey apparently concerned
him not in the loast though he knew
that within that suitcase weighed with
stones was the prison garb of madigan

  three years of service  a harbor
police boat during his early years with
the department had made thornton an
expert in navigating the bay across
the intervening water ferryboats were
plying shooting past these keeping
clear of other craft he kept the boat
pointed straight ahead toward the steep
hills beyond where lights sparkled from
the house windows high on the hills

  soon he passed the long piers of the
san francisco water front that thrust
themselves out into the bay in such close
proximity that they looked like the
teeth of some gigantic comb lime
barks lumber schooners merchantmen
and ominous-looking battleships an-
chored in the harbor showed up mistily
and soon were left behind

  now swing to the south com-
manded lacey

  thornton swung the boat and with
the propeller eating white water it beat
down the south arm of the bay

  at midnight they ran into a little
cove beside a dilapidated abandoned
warehouse

  the boat was beached in the sucking
ooze of the shore line and thornton
found himself on a dark and lonely
spot with two as dangerous criminals
as had ever crossed his path

  off in the distance he could see a
string of lights that marked a road
leading from the city a pistol shot or a
dozen of them would be lost across that
the shadow magazine



barren stretch of land that lay between
the tumble-down warehouse and that
string of lights

  several times in coming across the
bay he had caught the wicked eyes of
madigan gazing at him suspiciously
suppose the two men took it into their
heads to search him suppose they
found the gun on him a blackjack and
a pair of handcuffs it would mean the
fight of his life to keep from laying out
there on that desolate spot-a corpse
when morning came

  lacey when he had hired him had
told him he would pay him well for the
nights work yes pay him with a bul-
let was the way thornton figured it
he became cool more vigilant-his ear
caught every wid his eye every move-
ment of the two men

  you wanted me to get you here in
a hurry and youre here he remarked
to lacey as he wiped his hands on his
jacket close to where his gun reposed
his hand was ready to seize it at the
slightest show of the two men putting
away their guns which they now carried
in their hands

  you didnt lie to me none when you
said you knew where to get a speedy
motor boat and how to run it replied
lacey come inside and have a drink
and somethin to eat he glanced sig-
nificantly toward madigan

  they climbed up the soggy embank-
ment to the gloomy-looking warehouse
with its hint of tragedy lacey un-
locked the door inside he struck a
match and lighted the lamp standing
upon a small improvised table

  thornton realized that he was walk-
ing into the jaws of death yet it was
with seeming indifference that he fol-
lowed lacey and madigan his eyes
roved around the place they had a
sleepy look but under the lowered lids
the glance they gave was none the less
penetrating and retentive

  he could see that the old wooden
structure had been falling to decay for

years the rafters were covered with
cobwebs the floor and walls thick with
dust near the door was a pile of dry
tule grass and over in a corner lay a
mattress with a few blankets upon it
on the floor near the mattress was a tin
box lacey opened the box and brought
out a bottle of whisky some rye bread
and a can of corned beef

  thornton surmised that lacey had
prepared the place as a hide-out for
madigan until they could safely reach
the railroad to the south and make their
escape to some other part of the world
there was no hiding place that he could
see for the stolen gold unless it was
in or under the mattress he was cu-
rious to examine the particular spot
where the mattress lay

  im as hungry as a wolf after that
drive across the bay lacey remarked
he opened the can of beef cut it and
the bread with his long-bladed knife
and spread the food out upon a news-
paper which he had placed on the dirty
floor

  the three men squatted dowij around
the newspaper and proceeded to devour
their midnight meal

  lacey however ate leisurely despite
his claim of wolflike hunger his eyes
flitted from the face of thornton to
that of madigan if thornton did not
mistake his man lacey had marked him
for death and was now debating with
himself as the best means of accomplish-
ing his purpose

  thorntons brain worked fast to de-
vise some means of getting out of the
trap and he was alert for any signal
that might pass between lacey and
madigan and that might spell death to
himself

  lacey and madigan took frequent
pulls at the bottle but thornton drank
sparingly and always with his eyes
upon the faces of the two men

  now and then the lean prison-white
face of madigan with its cruel mouth
and sinister eyes would look up at


the shadow magazine

thornton but he said nothing finally
his snakelike eyes lifted under the line
of black brows that met above his nose
the whisky was beginning to take effect
and the evil in him was beginning to as-
sert itself

  well how long are we goin to stick
around with this punk he growled to
lacey with a nod of his head toward
thornton

  lacey took another drink from the
bottle but did not reply he slid back-
ward until his back rested against the
wall then he lit a cigarette and his
eyes twitched as he gazed first at thorn-
ton and then at madgian his hard-
lined face was set in thought as though
pondering over something that was very
difficult

  thornton was not slow in figuring out
what was troubling lacey he wanted
to get rid of him and seal his lips for-
ever as to the manner of madigans es-
cape but he did not want to have a
hand himself in the killing of a good-
natured and somewhat stupid mechanic
who had brought him safely across the
bay

  dont you think i had better look
the boat over and get it in good shape
it wasnt hitting just right as we made
the last few miles of the run suggested
thornton his face as blank as a china-
mans

  lacey gave him a slow appraising
look there was a vacant almost stupid
expression upon the detectives face that
disarmed any suspicion that lacey might
have entertained at thorntons offer
he glanced knowingly at madigan and
the latter seemed to understand the sig-
nificance of that glance lacey smiled
grimly

  that aint a bad idea he drawled
after a pause but youd better take
my pardner along in case you need
help

  lacey got up and opened the door
madigan stepped out into the night fol-
lowed by thornton

  lacey closed the door and went back
into the warehouse to tune his ears for
the shot that would tell him tliat his
mechanic had gone to where his lips
would never reveal the manner of madi-
gans escape from san quentin prison

  outside thornton kept several feet
behind the convict as they went toward
the boat some two hundred yards away

  surly and silent madigan slouched
ahead he had his thumbs hooked in
his coat pocket where a bulge told
thornton a gun lay ready to spit its
message of death

  the detective knew that he must act
quickly unseen his hand stole under
his jacket and he drew out something
dark slipping it over the wrist of his
right hand

  they had almost reached the boat
madigans hand was fumbling at his
coat pocket thorntons eyes were fixed
like a hawk upon that hand the butt
end of a gun in madigans hand slid
slowly out of his pocket and he whirled
around quickly

  an oath burst from madigans lips
now you-

  quick as a flash thornton swung the
blackjack at the same instant he threw
an arm over madigans head covering
his mouth to smother any groan the
gun dropped from the hand of the con-
vict he fell limp into the arms of
thornton who quickly dragged him to
a spot where a lone tree stood with a
trunk not over four inches m diameter
he stretched the unconscious form upon
the ground with head touching the tree
then he drew madigans arms above
his head and backward until they en-
circled the tree from somewhere under
his greasy mechanics uniform thorn-
ton brought out a pair of handcuffs
snapped them on his prisoners wrists
and left him there fastened as securely
as ever he had been fastened to the bars
of a solitary in san quentin the
job was done quickly and quietly
the shadow magazine



  gun in hand he now stealthily ap-
proached the warehouse he found the
door closed he lifted the latch softly
and pressed his hand against the door
and peered through the narrow open-
ing

  hat off lacey was standing in the
comer where the mattress had been he
was gazing down into a yawning hole in
the floor its trapdoor thrown back
against the wall

  thornton stepped inside and leveled
his gun at him

  up with em he commanded

  lacey wheeled with the speed of
lightning he had his gun out

  up with em he mocked

  they both fired at the same instant
a bullet grazed laceys head just as
another bullet from laceys gun tore
the end of a finger off of thorntons
gun hand sending the gun spinning to
the floor

  up went thorntons hands

  but they did not go up in the way
that lacey had expected as his hands
shot upward thornton leaped forward
and caught laceys gun arm the gun
exploded in the air sending a bullet
through the ceiling

  with a quick twist of laceys wrist
thornton wrested the gun from his
grasp before he could get a firm hold
of it lacey had knocked it clattering
to the floor

  lacey tore himself out of thorntons
strong arms and backed away slowly
guardedly toward the yawning hole in
the floor

  thornton determined that his man
should not escape by that means leaped
forward he shot out a powerful
right it was dodged by the alert lacey
and they clinched again

  a kick in the shins sent lacey to his
knees but he was up again apparently
invincible to the pain he must have felt
he came at thornton with a wild rush
cursing clawing and groping for his
eyes

  thornton despite the wounded finger
landed a blow that split laceys lips
another swift blow thornton figured
would prove a knock-out

  lacey glared at the determined face
of thornton with its square firm jaw
his eyes were glittering with malignant
fury his mop of red hair seemed to
lift aggressively and his nose seemed
more like an eagles beak than ever it
was a furious devilish face that thorn-
ton now confronted

  lacey maneuvered around until the
table was between them suddenly he
sprang forward and grasped the burn-
ing lamp hurling it straight at thorn-
tons head

  with the speed of a panther thornton
dodged the lamp it struck the wall
broke above the dry tule grass and
instantly that part of the warehouse be-
came a mass of flames

  with an oath lacey leaped toward
the hole in the floor plunged into it
and raised his hand to close the trap-
door

  another second and thornton was
upon him he wrenched the hand of
lacey from the edge of the door and
plunged into the hole after him with
an ominous flump the door dropped
down above their heads leaving them
to continue their combat in the darkness
of their subterranean battleground

  thornton could hear the crackling of
the flames above them as they rolled
about in the dark fighting furiously
both were soon choking from the smoke
that seeped through from the floor
above

  thornton regretted that he had tossed
aside his blackjack when he had knocked
out madigan he could use it now to
good advantage but the sinewy
strength of lacey was beginning to be
sapped by the fury of the fight finally
a well-directed blow on the jaw silenced
his cursing and snarling and he lay
still


the shadow magazine

  thornton could hear the falling of
burning- timbers as they hit the floor
above him it would be only a matter
of a little time when the floor would
give way and the tunnel would be filled
with flames and debris he coughed
violently from the smoke that filled his
lungs he knew that it would be death
to attempt to escape from the place by
means of the trapdoor through which he
had plunged

  he had not the slightest idea as to
how he was to get out he tried to
light several matches but found that
they had gotten wet during the drive
across the bay all that he knew was
that the tunnel was pitch dark damp
filled with smoke and soggy under
foot

  he crept through the darkness not
knowing what instant he might plunge
through some opening into the bay as
he pressed forward the height of the
tunnel decreased and he was obliged to
assume a stooping position finally his
foot struck what seemed to be a step
that led nowhere

  he guessed the reason for its being
there ran his hand along the tunnels
roof and it came in contact with another
trapdoor he tried to shove it open
but it was immovable evidently it was
locked

  then he ran his fingers along the edge
of it until they came to a bolt he drew
the bolt back placed a shoulder against
the door and heaved upward it
opened a quantity of earth and small
stones falling inside from the outside
that had concealed the exit he took a
deep breath of the fresh air that struck
his face

  then he returned to where lacey lay
and dragged his limp body through the
tunnel and left it face upward under
the open trapdoor where there was no
likelihood of his being smothered to
death now that he had conquered his
man he wanted the satisfaction of taking
him alive to headquarters

  for an instant the flare of light from
the burning building blinded thorn-
tons eyes as he crawled out of the dark
tunnel but the air though hot felt
good to his cheeks and his choking
lungs he staggered over to a log and
sat down

  huge tongues of flames were now
bursting from all parts of the ware-
house casting a lurid light over the
ground sparks showered down upon
him from somewhere in the distance
there came the sound of a fire gong and
the roar of fire engines

  glancing off toward the long line of
road lights thornton saw the head-
lights of a fire engine rushing along the
road it turned into a narrow lane
that led to the warehouse it soon came
clanging up to where he sat followed
by other fire apparatus and a police car

  it was a bloody-faced and clay-be-
smeared man that greeted the firemen
and the police thornton quickly
identified himself and while the fire-
men were tossing water on the burning
building he and one of the policemen
descended into the tunnel with a lan-
tern borrowed from a fireman

  they dragged lacey out and placed
him flat on the ground he was still
unconscious but soon came groaning
to life

  thornton signaled to one of the po-
licemen to follow him together they
went to where madigan was handcuffed
to the tree half dragging half carry-
ing their prisoner they got him to the
police car and shoved him in

 then into the tunnel thornton
plunged again-this time alone with
the aid of a lantern he searched the
place when he came out he carried a
large leather bag he stooped down
ran his hands through laceys pockets
looking for a key finding it he opened
the bag and glanced at its contents
there was gold in it-gold coin in
canvas bags and loose

  he told the policemen to put lacey
the shadow magazine



in the car thornton climbed in be-
hind them carrying the bag

  where to asked the driver

  to the hall of justice answered
thornton i want to plant these two
fellows in the central lockup where the
chief can look em over in the morn-
ing

  must be tough eggs remarked a
policeman

  they are replied thornton as
hard-boiled as they make em now let
me have your first-aid kit and ill
bandage my hand one of em nicked
off part of a finger with his gun and
im beginning to notice it

air police

        as an addition to their present police departments many of
    the larger cities bordering on water have added air patrols to the
    force this is necessitated by the extent of crime along the water
    fronts as the territory covered by the water front in most cases
    is large this means of policing has been quite successful the
    entire water front can be covered in a much shorter time than it can
    be patrolled by a policeman on foot

        although in the majority of cases the efforts of the air police
    are limited to the locating of thieves escaping in boats some un-
    usual cases have turned up in the course of duty

        recently the yacht of a wealthy manufacturer was stolen from
    its dock along the atlantic ocean the yacht had just been
    stocked for a lengthy cruise and tjie owner knew that if the boat
    was not quickly recovered it would soon be out of sight of land
    but fortunately a fog settled down soon after the yacht was
    stolen although this prevented the owner from immediately
    searching for his stolen boat he was sure that the fog would also
    handicap the escaping yacht

        the fog lasted for three days but as soon as it lifted enough
    to assure good visibility the owner of the stolen boat hired an air-
    plane to assist him in the search after cruising for some hours
    the yacht was discovered a short distance out from shore the
    owner after swooping low and identifying his boat by the color
    of the paint turned about and headed for the nearest airport where
    he could ask the aid of the police air patrol

        in a short time the police plane had overtaken the yacht and
    landed in front of it the men who had stolen the boat launched
    a small boat and tried to escape in it the police plane taxied
    after the boat and the men could do nothing but surrender

the third degree

a department in which our readers face a test
of brains skill and common sense

 the apartment murder

    on the door of the old brick building was the high-sounding name of royal
apartments actually however it was nothing but a rooming house long and
narrow with doors set at regular intervals along the straight hallway housing men
and women of little less than average means

   and there was a murder there--a murder that detective thomas was sent
to solve

   the killing was in a room in the front of the building there were no
witnesses no evidence to point to any particular person as the guilty one not
until the rest of the roomers on that floor were questioned

    one of them mr marvin living near the front of the building said he saw
something that might explain the case early that morning-about the time the
murder was judged to have taken place-he heard a door open out of curiosity
he got up from his chair-he was reading unable to sleep--and looked out his
door he saw another roomer hennefin going down the hallway to his room at
the end of the building hennefin was near his door and marvin could get only
a brief look before stepping back into his own room to avoid detection but in that
one glance he saw blood on the front of hennefins shirt-blood which must have
come from the murdered man

    no other resident could give any information whatever about the case the
murdered mans relations with the other roomers were negligible no one seemed
to know much about him

    so detective thomas went to work to learn all he could about the victim and
the suspect what he learned and how he solved the case you will see in the
next issue	

the answer to this will appear in the next number oi
the shadow magazine


the third degree solution

which is most likely

the answer to the problem given in the previous issue of
the shadow magazine

    the case of the missing bonds which faced detective man son was not so
hopeless as might at first seem it was not a matter of your guess is as good as
mine but a matter of judging the possible character of each individual in the case

    eliminating the members of the small bond house the detective reasoned as
follows

    the stenographer who was not even in the building at the time the bonds
were lost was automatically out of it of course it was possible that the time
of the loss was wrong-but again the house was so small that this was most
unlikely every one in the place knew where everything was and the slightest
error would be easily and promptly detected

    the office boy presented a good possibility but thorough reasoning would
relieve him of responsibility though the lad might well realize the worth of the
bonds and the fact that they were readily negotiable he would have a harder time
disposing of them than any one else unless he had a confederate or some one who
had forced him to the job outside crooks however find a small bond house
meager pickings so the chances here were slight

    of the four men probably the one least in danger was the teller who had
charge of the bonds he could easily have taken them-but he probably did not
because he was fully responsible for them and their loss if unrecovered would
reflect upon him if he intended to steal he would probably arrange things so
that the loss would come at a time or apparently at a time when he was not
responsible for their safe-keeping

    last of the four-the head of the house he was stealing from himself if
he did it but even so he would profit by it and he would be the one to profit most
without risking too much

    although the firm would lose by the theft since the bonds were only partly
covered by insurance he would still have the entire worth of the bonds since they
were readily negotiable of all the suspects he had best means for turning the
bonds even though they would be listed as stolen into cash he would collect the
insurance the firm would lose the difference between the face value and the
insurance-but the head of the firm would still have the negotiable value of the
bonds which would give him a neat profit over the loss

the detective did some strict logical reasoning in the case-and he was right
the head of the house was not as clever as he thought mmself for the law got him

there will be another problem to test your wits in the next issue of
the shadow magazine

canine police

no one will ever forget the famous bloodhound scene from the stage
presentation of uncle toms cabin that play produced practically
every place where drama is presented has done more than anything else
to point out the use of dogs as an aid to the enforcement of law stories of the
perseverance of the bloodhound trail of their infallibility and of their uncanny
ability to pick out the guilty person have become legion

    and yet while people have marveled at the bloodhound they have missed the
animal that is a real help to the police it is not the bloodhound that proves the
best aid to cops to-day-it is the police dog

    more and more the extent of the police dogs use in modem police work has
been increasing his efficiency has been tested in a number of different ways and
it always proves to be better than was expected the dog lives up to his title of
police every time he has the opportunity

the breed

    this branch of police work is still very much in its infancy there are only
a few police departments which have the dogs to serve any but an ornamental
purpose therefore there remains some controversy as to the requirements pur-
poses and results of this phase of police work only in a few things are most
police officers who are acquainted with this work in agreement

    one of these points is that a pure breed is not essential instead of going
after the purest of police dogs the officers seek out any police dog that seems to
appeal to the sense of the trainer if they come up to all the other qualifications
the breed becomes a matter of no importance

    the essential requirements are sound health and a strong body police dogs
are put under some mighty severe strains and only those in the best of physical
condition can be used this naturally excludes those of too large or too small
size if that size serves as an impediment

    as far as intelligence goes-most dogs if properly trained can do their work
to satisfaction the smart dog is merely one which has in some way or other
received more training tta dogs selected for police work therefore owe all of
their knowledge and ability to their careful training

rookie dogs	

    there are rookie dogs just as there are rookie cops and the work of
both of them is about equal the cop just on the job gets all the routine work-
so does the dog unfortunately no matter how muah training the dog may have
he must always continue in routine woric
the shadow magazine

    the dogs are taken when they are very young puppies put in the trainrlo
kennels and put through their paces in the course of their training they ar
put into positions which may arise in their later work hundreds of times and
although the situation may not be exactly the same the response of the dog must
be dependable to answer an alarm one time and fail to heed it another make
a dog entirely useless for police work such an animal would have its master
continually answering to false cries and probably fail to alarm when the need
was greatest

    in the etonentary training the dog is taught to recognize signs of danger
or conditions which are unusual a house full of people going about their usual
tasks will not excite his suspicions but a vacant house with one lone prowler will
excite his sense of danger

     likewise the casual stroller goes by unharmed whereas the furtive passer-by
gets more than a casual glance

    especially important is the training of these dogs in response to some out-
standing cues a shot sign of danger to all officers upholding the law is the most
important cue a shot makes the good police dog the most alert thing on earth
brings his entire sense of hearing to focus upon the one point of the shot im-
mediate investigation or immediate report to the dogs officer is the response

     equally important is the dogs response to a police whistle this is not only
for the purpose of keeping the dog at all times within control but also for the
sake of unusual contingency there are times when an officer gets into a situation
in which he needs immediate help if the dog which is on duty in his territory can
be called by the typical police summons he may avoid serious consequences

     another picturesque as well as important bit of training is the dogs response
to the time-honored method of police summons from one member qf the force
to the other-the pounding of a-nightstick upon the sidewalk the police dog will
sense the call for help even before the officer with the most sensitive feet can feel
the vibrations caused by his fellow officers nightstick on the concrete

teamed up

    the police dogs are always teamed up or paired off with officers covering
their territory every day the dogs are sent out from their kennels and deposited
with their accompanying officer at their place of duty the dogs are always
muzzled for they take their work seriously and the offender would not fare so
well if the dogs powerful muscles were left unleashed and a prisoner brought
into headquarters in sections would not be so appealing

     on their beat the dogs take to their work with as much proficiency as their
two-legged masters where the officer patrols only the main portions of his beat
the dog is taught to go through all the nooks and crannies of the streets covering
the ground with a speed not possible to the cop the barking of the dog is
sufficient to attract attention when something is wrong if that does not work
the dog either takes a hand in the attack himself or scurries away in search of the
officer

    there are stories to back up these statements one dog spotting a broken
cellar window in a vacant house went in finding a burglar in the basement the
dog cornered the burglar and barked and barked and barked at first he made
no move to attack the burglar being content with the noise he was making as a
means of attracting the officer

    when the burglar attempted to draw a gun the animal jumped upon the

detective work 

      not only in such forceful manner but also in mofe subtle ways do these dogs
 earn their names and their reputation they- are veritable bloodhounds too in
 more than oneecase leading a police offfcer to a discarded weapqn or some stray
 bits pievidence which their sensitive noses search out as evidence while others
 ffrlook the article the importance of a bit of real evidence ean never be over-

 	estimated in tough police cases

      though there is a limit to the capabilities of these dogs there is also a special- 
 need for them and there is work for which they are admirably suited in the-
 residential districts they have proven their mettle as sound patrolmen and wher-
 ever they are in use they have the hearty support of officers and residents alike

      perhaps their scope can be extended with further training if so it will be
 a boon to police work in the meantime those who work faithfully and con-
 sistently in the training of these animals deserve no less credit
