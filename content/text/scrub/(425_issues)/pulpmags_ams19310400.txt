 always outside of things
 -thats where i was just
 twelve short months ago
 i just didnt have the
 cash that was all no
 theatres no parties no
 good restaurants no real
 enjoyment of life i was
 just getting by just ex-
 isting what a difference
 today  drive my own
 car have a good bank
 account enjoy all the
 amusements i please

i couldnt get the good things of life

        then i quit my job and found myself

how does a man go about making
more money if i asked myself
that question once i asked it a hun-
dred times

  i know the answer now-you bet i
know the way good money is made and
im making it gone forever are the days
of cheap shoes cheap clothes walking
home to save carfare pinching pennies to
make my salary last from one pay-day to
the next one i own one of the finest
radio stores you ever saw and i get al-
most all the radio service and repair work
in town the other radio dealers send
their hard jobs to me so you can see how
i stand in my line

  but-its just a year ago that i was a
poorly paid clerk i was struggling along
on a starvation salary until by accident my
eyes were opened and i saw just what was
the matter with me heres the story of
just how it happened

  one of the big moments of my life had
come i had just popped the fatal ques-
tion and louise said yes 

  louise wanted to go in and tell her
father about it right away so we did he
sort of grunted when we told him the
news and asked louise to leave us alone
and my heart began to sink as i looked
at his face

  so you and louise have decided to get
married he said to me when we were
alone well bill just listen to me ive
watched you often here at the house with
louise and i think you are a pretty good
upstanding young fellow i knew your
father and mother and youve always had
a good reputation here too but let me
ask you just one question-how much
do you make

  twenty-eight a week i told him

  he didnt say a word-just wrote it
down on a piece of paper

  have you any prospects of a better job
or a good raise some time soon he aslced

  no sir i cant honestly say that i
have i admitted im looking for some-
thing better all the time though

  looking eh how do you go about
it

  well that question stopped-me

  how did i i was willing to take a
better job if i saw the chance all right but
i certainly had laid no plans to make
such a job for myself wjhen he saw my
confusion he grunted i thought so he
said then he held up some figures hed
been scribbling at

   ive just been figuring out your fam-
 ily budget bill for a salary of twenty-
 eight a week ive figured it several ways
 so you can take your pick of the one you
 like best heres budget no  i figure
 you can afford a very small unfurnished
 apartment make your payments on enough
 plain inexpensive furniture to fix such an
 apartment up pay your electricity gas and
 water bills buy just about one modest out-
 fit of clothes for both of you once each
 year and save three dollars a week for
 sickness insurance and emergencies but
 you cant eat and youll have to go with-
 out amusements until you can get a good
 substantial raise in salary

    i began to turn red as fire

    that budget isnt so good after all he
 said glancing at me maybe budget no

  will sound better-

   thats enough mr sullivan i said
 have a heart i can see things pretty
 clearly now things i was kidding myself
 about before let me go home and think
 this over and home i went my mind
 in a whirl

measly little clerical job and devoted my
full time to my radio business

since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other line of
radio besides building my own retail busi-
ness such as broadcasting manufacturing
experimenting sea operating or any one of
the score of lines they prepare you for and
to think that until that day i sent for their
eye-opening book id been wailing i never
had a chance

now im making real money louise and
i have been married six months and there
wasnt any kidding about budgets by mr
sullivan when we stepped off either ill
bet that today i make more money than the
old boy himself

heres a real tip you may not be as bad
off as i was but think it over-are you
satisfied  are you making enough money
at work that you like  would you sign a
contract to stay where you are now for the
next ten years making the same money if
not youd better be doing something about
it instead of drifting

this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of the
at home i turned the problem over and  different lines of radio is fascinating ab-
over in my mind id popped the question sorbing well paid the national radio in-

piece of fiction in which our well-known writer in-

errors in science

                      by t oconor sloane phd

ears ago it was the writer of these lines produced
a book which dealt with the subject of physics
there is one doctrine in the science which under
ordinary conditions such as we live under holds
sway it is the law of the conservation of energy

if you lift a weight to the height of a foot and
release it so that it can fall back to its original plane it will
exert the same amount of energy in its descent as you exerted
in lifting it your action created no energy it may be put
in the sense that you converted vital energy into potential
energy if it was a pound weight the energy involved was a
foot-pound you can neither create nor annihilate energy

  force is far different there is no conservation about it it
exists as long as it is exercised and then goes out of existence
when the exercising of it ceases

  the text of the book in question went on to say that there
is no such thing of doctrine as that of the conservation of force
this is absolutely true but one of the reviewers of the book
asserted that the author of the same said that there was no law
or doctrine of the conservation of energy apparently this
reviewer did not grasp the simple fact that force is one thing and
energy another

  this failure of comprehension of an essential difference led to
the publication of a curious little book about the middle of the
last century it was on the subject of the conservation of force
there was something seductive about the error the book was
made up of quotations of celebrated authorities on the subject
which for some time evidently had excited much discussion the
opinions of the various authorities were decidedly of the hazy
order faraday was one of those cited the problem had been
submitted to him and it was interesting to see how he could not
reconcile it in his mind yet was not willing to assign it to its
true position as a falsity pure and simple

  this error in classical physics as the science is now sometimes
picturesquely termed is comparable to one of the older ones
for centuries it had been held that a heavy body would fall
faster than a light one it was gallileo in pisa who disproved
it by dropping objects of different weights from the leaning
tower but why had it never occurred to anyone before to try
the simple experiment

  another curious error was immortalized by otto van guericke



with his famous hemispheres he shows them in his book
between two teams of horses one team pulling against the other
in tug-of-war fashion it is quite impressive but the pull to
separate them would have been the same with a single team of
horses if one of the hemispheres had been fastened to a post
and if the two teams had pulled against the post he would have
had double the pull on his hemispheres but this fact seems to
have been beyond his conception

  recently in one of the editorials in this magazine the curious
phlogiston doctrine held for many years as one of the funda-
mental laws of chemistry was alluded to it kept science in
abeyance and prevented its theory being formulated until
lavoisier and priestly proved that a pound added to a pound
gave two pounds just as truly in chemistry as in anything else

  it is pretty certain that no one now accepts the epicurian
chaos minute particles of matter going about through space
and eventually joining and thus starting the work of creating
all that we know of matter solid liquid and gaseous this
idea antedates chemistry for two thousand years ago wood was
wood in the belief of all and not the compound of carbon
hydrogen oxygen and some other elements as we now consider
it to be this lack of knowledge applied to all compound
substances

  edgar a poe says that if we knew everything and had nothing
to find out and discover if there was nothing left for us to exer-
cise our intellects upon we would be very unhappy but in spite
of what jeans millikan eddington and einstein are doing we
are not in any danger of the unhappiness announced by poe

  changing of theories abandonment of long accepted views are
not to be treated as mere errors we do not know today how
near the truth some of our theories are the old-time system
of scientific obstinacy characteristic of victorian science has
pretty well disappeared and the best men are open to modification
of their scientific beliefs a good instance of this was the sudden
acceptance of the einstein theories it is they that are at the
root of a sort of division of science especially physical and
cosmical to the old working basis is assigned the title of
classic physics in all this connection it is interesting to see how
a sort of flexibility appears in enunciation of theories by the
greatest of scientists and how willing they are to let others be-
lieve different from themsleves it was far different in old times

                  a sequel to out of the void

           by leslie f stone

 rphe old-time evolutionists claimed that through sheer influence of surround-
 j- ings and conditions of existence man has evolved to what he is what might
 have happened under absolutely different atmospheric influences remains to us
 eminently problematical-particularly conditions that might be prevalent out-
 side our own galaxy in worlds of which even our most powerful telescopes fail
 to give us an inkling but it seems increasingly absurd to hold to the opinion
 that there can be no intelligent life except on the earth leslie f stone has finally
 answered the insistent call for a sequel to out of the void with this new serial
 which incidentally is complete in itself in our opinion across the void eas-
 ily surpasses the original

chapter i

an old friend

hen janson ushered the three visitors
into his study walter kington looked
up in peevish anger drat the man
would the fellow never learn that he
was not to bring callers when his
master was ensconced behind the desk in the room that
bespoke private  he must assuredly be sent on his
way yet kington was not going to discharge janson
from his service for at the sight of the tall well-pro-
portioned bronze-haired man who had entered the room
kington forgot the present to recall the past the past
in which richard dorr had figured so largely

  thirty years ago wally kington he was wally
then had averred he would always know dick dorr
anywhere anytime no matter how the years might
change them both today was proof of his given word
for immediately he had recognized his one-time chum
in the browned lined face before him

  it had not been wallys fault that his sister terry

had played rather loosely with his handsome chum that
because of the incident dorr had left england for an
african gold mine but wally had never forgiven him-
self for having allowed dorr to meet terry-terry
who liked men only to demonstrate her own power over
them to toss them aside with that cold inhuman laugh
of hers after they had given her their love wally did
know that it had been terrys greatest mistake when she
laughed at dorr for thereafter she had never been the
same had never so much as looked at another man and
four years later had gotten herself killed in an idiotic
dash for america by airplane

  as a flood this all came back to kington as for the
first time in thirty years he looked into dorrs familiar
face then he was on his feet pumping the others hand
gad dick its good to see you old man he was cry-
ing when did you arrive in london and why the
devil havent you let me hear from you all these years
its twenty-six years since i received your last letter
why man alive you knock me off my feet and youve
not changed much either look at me    not much of
the wally of old days eh

  dorr was smiling warmly down upon the little man
from his own six foot height but his demonstration was


almost sadly we watched the meeting of the two-the
handsome silver man of abrui and the monster of
venus they came to a halt    but to my wonder
nothing happened

amazing stories

less enthusiastic than the others the years had not
aged him greatly though they had put a feathery tracing
of gray at his temples and impressed lines on his face
that only added to its power leaving him this serious
eyed man kington could remember that dorr had al-
ways been a serious fellow-too serious else the terry
affair would never have sent him off to africa to forget
his hurt he was a reticent chap too never effusive
wally on the other hand had always been the jolly-
well-met fellow open with his likes and dislikes and
only because he had become the personage that he was
eminent scientist and all that    had he perforce been
made to shut up like a clam to the goggling world yet
to his friends he was still the wally of old bubbling
with good fellowship and friendliness but the years
had sat on him more heavily made his short body
round and his head bald well everyone wasnt lucky
enough to keep both their figure and hair as dick dorr
had

  dorr was answering kingtons questions slowly al-
most wearily i havent been in london wally in all
these years because  have been farther away than you
would dare believe and as for my letting you or any-
one know-well that was just about an impossibility
but wait let me present my companions

  during the few moments consumed by the greeting
kington had failed to note the two who had followed
dorr into his chamber but now for the first time his
eyes sought out the woman and the youth framed in the
doorway he saw a slender woman gray-haired and
with the ravages of the years on her sweet calm face
that could never have been very beautiful but whole-
some and gentle-eyed it still was her eyes however
were strangely arresting not because of the life in them
but because of the faded look of a light that had died
within them she was clothed in what appeared to be a
home-made dress and hat and even the eminent recluse
that he was kington was quick to note that her gar-
ments were antiquated by at least two decades despite
the fact that they seemed newly made later he was to
see that both dorr and the youth were dressed in much
the same old-fashioned way-in ill-fitting poorly
tailored clothing now he was trying to learn what was
so strange about the young fellow who stood a little to
the left and behind the woman

  in the first place he was overtall-surely all of six
feet six inches or more-with a large powerful body that
still had something of the immaturity of youth in it
then he was wearing large ungainly spectacles that
hid his eyes and on his head was an enveloping cap
that covered hair and forehead and which he had not
removed on entering the house yet there was enough
of his face showing to tell that it was a handsome one
with regular features almost unearthly in contour deli-
cate and esthetically at variance with the power of his
big adolescent body and even in the lamp light that
lighted the windowless room kington noticed a strange
quality of his complexion a queer silvery tint that
seemed to underlie the skin but that shone forth as
color shines under the weave of an irridescent length
of cloth the scientist thought he had never seen an
odder looking young man

  this is elsie rollins-weiti and her son ezra-weit
said dorr by way of introduction that did little to ex-
plain the ill-assorted pair in whom a slight family re-
semblance might be seen on second glance but dorr
evidently wishing to lose little time in either introduc-

tions or explanations gathered his one-time friends
attention to himself for the second time

startling news

f  vhe tale i have to relate you wally is a strange
i one he began but after you hear our needs
a you will not be surprised that ive come to you
first aside from our relations of the past we need
someone whose word carries weight on this globe and
i know you will do all that you can to help us when i
show you what benefits the earth is to derive from the
connection i have to offer her

  kington did not answer immediately the odd speech
affected him strangely in the first place he had not
yet gotten over the surprise of seeing dorr again then
there were these strangers dicks queer attitude and
appearance and now his queerer talk

  why dick he said i dont know what you are
driving at why man    you speak as though you were
from another world    as if  

  right i am from another world wally    that is
what i wish to tell you about interrupted dick

  had kingtons colleagues seen the man at that in-
stant they would have been astounded kington the
unapproachable the unemotional the staid sauve scien-
tist who dominated all gatherings the man who never
showed surprise at the latest scientific developments the
man who could ruffle an einstein kington stood there
looking like a school lad who had just heard for the
first time that the world was round and he was ac-
tually stammering

  my god    dick    w-what are you-telling
m-me you-you are-but of course you are sane
youve changed-youve-why  

  of course i am sane-and i am telling you the
truth come-come wally brace up my statements
shouldnt shock you in this day and age why ive
learned that you now travel this globe of ours at the
rate of  kilometres per hour isnt the next step
for you to take into space

  kington had to swallow something before he found
his voice you mean that youve crossed space
yes and if we can arrive at terms with the earth you
will be crossing it yourself shot the other

  kingtons eyes stared from his head you mean it
dick he took his handkerchief from his pocket to
mop his brow youve struck me all in a heap dick-
its-well-its a shock you know

  dorr smiled sorry old chap that i startled you
but you see ive lived with the thought for the past
twenty-five years now and i cant realize that others
still cant grasp it easily

  well come sit down-all of you-and tell me about
it i guess theres a long story

  the three arranged themselves to their hosts liking
then janson was asked to bring brandy for the men and
wine for the woman ezra-weit accepted his glass and
sniffed of it before he drank it down then there was
such a coughing and sputtering as never had been heard
before over a glass of brandy janson had water for
the youth who took it gratefully he had to remove his
dark glasses that had become misted and an exclamation
of shocked surprise escaped kington when he saw what
the spectacles had hidden ezra-weit had lavender eyes
across the void



dorr had been chuckling over the scene its ezras
first try at hard liquor we should have warned him
tell him to take his cap off whispered kington

sotto voce

  dorr looked up in surprise then he grinned and said
something to the youth in a strange tongue the boy
complied and exposed a head covered with a thick mop
of hair that was as silvery as the small vase standing on
kingtons broad desk at a glance it could be seen that
the hair had never had other pigmentation that it was
silver as kingtons scrap of hair was black and dorrs
reddish bronze

  he comes of this planet youre speaking of queried
kington his eyes on the strange features mars
not mars but abrui as it is called by its inhabitants
a planet which has its orbit outside of neptune

  kington started at that and scanned dorrs face
closely gad that hardly sounds credible dick but
what a find why that is enough to make your name
resound to the heavens themselves yet let me think
-ah yes there have been astronomers who believed in
the fact that there are trans-neptunian planets wasnt
it forbes of edinburgh back in about  who in-
ferred from the study of the orbits of comets whose
aphelia are beyond neptune that there are two remote
members of the solar system revolving at the distances
of  and  astronomical units in periods of  to
 years 

  sorry observed dorr i am no astronomer but the
fact remains that abrui lies just about  astronomical
units from the sun with a period of  years or
 miles from sol or again if you like better
a little over  kilometres   the last was
said with a laugh at the new system of french measures
that were in use since dorrs time

miles will do remarked kington drily three
billion and a halfseem too much as it is but do you
mean you have actually traveled that distance dick
twice was the answer there and back of
course

good lord and here i was tinkering with mere
theories but come you must tell me how you happened
to go there in the first place and what there is to be
known about this abrui of yours    rum name that
abrui means home in the abruian tongue

  nice sentiment but whats it all about said
kington

chapter iii
some past history

in the next half hour dorr told something of what
had passed in the last quarter of a century of
professor ezra rollins experiments to send a
rocket containing a man to the planet mars and of
the subsequent taking off of the rocket with dana glea-
son and richard dorr the passing of mars and of the
landing upon the more distant world of abrui

  kington recalled the name of professor rollins who
had held an astronomical chair in one of the american
universities in  or thereabouts but who had been
laughed out of the country because of his belief that
he could do the impossible rollins it had been said
had disappeared into africa followed by a band of men
whose names bore long strings of college degree initials
and who believed implicitly in their leaders views and
were with him during the building of the machine rol-

lins had straightway been forgotten by the world but
what a sensation it would create when it was learned that
the professor had really succeeded in building his rocket
and launched it with two persons into the void

  that the rocket had not landed upon mars was not
surprising but it did sound like a fabrication to learn
that instead it had dropped upon another world a ninth
and undiscovered planet in the solar system which in-
stead of depending upon distant sol for light and en-
ergy had a satellite sun of its own to provide those life-
giving necessities it didnt seem possible that such a
planet could have escaped detection but then neptune
itself had not been discovered until  and astrono-
mers were not yet ready to agree positively that noth-
ing lay beyond that distant globe

  the reason for its not having been found in the last
fifty years explained dorr is believed by abruian
astronomers to be due to the fact that during that time
the planet is in the lag of neptune in its shadow and
is only now dropping behind for although neptunes
year is shorter than abrui it is a larger planet and has
taken that many years to pass by even now were the
astronomers to search for abrui it would be a diffi-
cult search for its influence is so small in proportion to
that of neptune as to be negligible and tradr abruis
sun does not throw out rays as does sol and would
appear no more than a pin-point of light too small in
fact to be detected against the myriad stars in its back-
ground

  of tradr abruian scientists have many opinions
the one theory generally accepted is that once the
satellite was a cold moon circling their planet but
it caught fire from the great deposits of radium which
are ever burning and now gives to the planet its light
and its heat this theory is suggested to them by the
fact that abrui itself is rich in this element and is to
them what fire is to earth thence there is eldimun
an ore which is not found on earth but which is ignited
in instantaneous combustion in the presence of radium
burning with a pinkish glow this as far as the abru-
ians have been able to learn burns infinitely tradr
glows pinkishly and it is supposed without a doubt
therefore that the satellite has also great deposits of
eldimun which upon catching fire will burn far into
the ages it is hoped so by the abruians

  now let me get this right said kington after dorr
had finished his long tale in  professor rollins
sent dana gleason whom he had chosen for a passenger
for his rocket because of that persons capabilities not
knowing that in truth she was a woman masquerading
all her life as a man because of her dead fathers dis-
like for the female sex you dick inadvertently dis-
covered her sex and at the last minute decided to ac-
company her rather than let the truth break the heart
of the old scientist who had become your friend there
in africa and thus prevent realization of the mans
life ambitions also because you believed that you and
she could work together in his behalf

  wait a minute wally you put too much stress upon
my altruistic motives i went especially because of the
woman i had discovered i loved her

  kington waved the aside away it matters not what
construction you wish to put on it    you might have
halted the whole thing if you had confessed the truth
to rollins and spent your life with her on good old
earth  

  more likely i would have lost her altogether you


amazing stories

mean wally if i had had the temerity to have exposed
her 

  oh well whatever the intents or purposes were they
count for nothing now it was the action well to
continue    your rocket passed mars and then you
two thought you were headed out into space when you
passed beyond neptune instead you struck abrui

  now it happened that miss gleason was picked up
by one moura-weit who was scouting about the planet
when your shell exploded he searched the ruins for
the complexion and coloring of a gor one of the bar-
barians who roved the land into which your rocket had
fallen so he carried miss gleason off to his civilized
country while you in turn fell into the hands of the
barbarians themselves and each of you thought the
other had died in the ruins of your vehicles each tak-
ing up life anew as you found it to the barbarians you
came in the light of a saviour fitting an old prophecy of
theirs that expressed a hope for one to lead them back
to the lands of which their enemy the tabora or silver
men of abrui had despoiled them knowing you as i
do a man who can not listen to the plea of the under-
fellow without going to his aid you took it upon your-
self to bring these poor down-trodden bronze men back
to their birthright unaware that the woman you loved
now lived among the gors oppressors

  that you managed to overthrow the tabora with
your crude cannon and home-made gunpowder and res-
cued dana gleason from a marriage of convenience with
this overbearing moura-weit who saw in her the means
to his own ends stacks of penny-novels but it always
was your lot dick to do the right thing and king-
ton smiled as he recalled other times when dorr had
done the right thing

  laugh wrinkles showed around dorrs brown eyes
and together the two laughed over old times it was
then that ezra-weit broke into a flood of words that
were wholly unintelligible to the scientist and smiling
elsie rollins-weiti interpreted them

  my son said she understands english only he is
backward in speaking it-but he wishes me to tell you
that dorr is too self-effacing that before dealing with
him you should know that without him abrui could
never know such peace as exists on that world at the
present time when richard overthrew the tabora
he forced the conquering gora to accept his terms
namely not to send the silver men back to the waste-
lands from which they had come in the past conquering
both gora and moata golden men but that the three
races of abrui the golden men who had been taboras
slaves the silver men and the bronze men should live
at peace with each other on the shores of the single ocean
sehti seeing the justice in his demands the three na-
tions in turn forced dick to become their ur-kirada
over-king so that he would be at their helm and teach
them how to live in accord so at the present time
richard dorr formerly of earth is no less than the
first citizen of his adopted world

during the time she spoke a rare blush of red over-
spread the ur-kiradas face but he joined in the
laugh that came at his expense

  the woman continued to speak in a voice that was as
beautiful and as colorful as her face was lacking in those
attributes and whats more mr kington dick taught
the abruians the art of being kindly not only to nations
but to individuals also with the downfall of the

taboran state moura-weit who had had himself created
urtor or over-prince of tabora with an eye to an ur-
kiradaship became an outcast because he had failed tq
save them from the ignominy of defeat and was looked
upon as a traitor and a price was put on his head his
people had been awakened to the fact that this ambitious
man sought power to meet his own selfish ends without
thought for the people themselves and now they were
demanding his death and his dishonor with the aid of
ubca-tor his one loyal henchman a prince of the realm
dick arranged for moura-weits escape from the planet
in an interplanetary machine which was then but begun
and which was finished in secret and so allowed the man
to flee the ire of his fellow-men then dick told the
people of what he had done begged them to pardon
moura-weit so that when he should return home he
should be accepted as their friend instead of as their
enemy

  kington was thoughtful after that but soon he spoke
again and what of this fellow what happened to
him  is he safe at home in abrui now raising a thriv-
ing brood of abruians he asked and did not see the
spasm of pain that crossed elsie rollins-weitis gentle
face

  that again said dorr is another story and al-
though abrui hasforgiven the man his duplicity and
honor him for his great work and discoveries made in
their behalf he never returned to abrui there were
only his wife and his son to return to his homeland when
he met an honorable death on kal the planet he dis-
covered in the star-system of alpha centauri which as
you know lies the closest of all the stars to our own
solar universe this wally is moura-weits wife he
placed a hand over elsies hand which was lying in her
lap and the boy is mouras son

chapter iv

concerning abrui

it was kingtons turn to feel embarrassment but he
felt that it was because of dorrs own negligence
in not making a more fitting introduction that he
had made the faux pax now dorr realizing his own
omissions went on to add elsie is the niece of pro-
fessor ezra rollins the man who invented the rocket
that sent dana and me to abrui she was an orphan at
the time when the professor left for africa and he
took her with him then a child of ten i believe my
mine as you know was but a few miles from the plan-
tation rollins purchased and we became good friends

  elsie was about fifteen when the rocket made its de-
parture and for the next five years she continued to
live with her uncle who had become a broken man when
he realized what he had done in sending us two off into
space possibly signing our death-warrant had he
known at the time that dana was a woman he might
have lost his mind entirely as it was the five years
were spent by him in praying each night for a message
from us he had the duplicate of the radio set we carried
in the rocket which was destroyed when our shell ex-
ploded in gora and he hoped against hope to hear the
welcome signal dana had promised to use in announcing
our arrival on mars	

  and although dana with a corps of engineers built
one set after another and strove to send sound across
space she never did succeed instead when moura-weit
across the void



and his ally ubca-tor departed in their space-flyer from
abrui dana commissioned them to deliver a document
in which she had described the world we had discovered
she also presented moura with her own diary for proof
that truly he came from her so moura-weit came to
earth with his message to the old scientist who in turn
demanded that he be carried with his niece into space
so that he might see the wonders of the universe at first
hand before he died

  gad exclaimed kington and you-mrs weiti
you have been in the void-you traveled to alpha cen-
tauri you say did the professor go with you to that
distant world of kal

  sadly elsie shook her head no he lived only a
few months and in that time we were still in the con-
fines of the solar-system in fact he never reached
mars

  and you had the courage to go across space

  she nodded i would have followed moura to the
ends of the cosmos

  what a man he must have been despite what youve
told me of his short-comings

  moura-weit she exclaimed left abrui with the
hope of atoning for his sins in turn to reap from the
universe knowledge that would improve the lot of his
world and through his efforts place its civilization on the
pinnacle but in the meantime he sought solace in the im-
mensity of the void he saw himself apart now from
the ambitious man he had been and he had learned from
richard dorr the mistake of putting ones self above
his fellow men the remainder of his life therefore
was spent in expiating his past sin all he did hence-
forth was in behalf of mankind he went to the distant
planet kal only for the honor it would bring to his own
people and to save another from making the same mis-
takes as he himself had made can you wonder that i
was glad to follow such a man

  a silence fell on the gathering after that eulogy but
again kingtons inquiring mind brought them back to the
present

  i wonder he asked if it would be asking too much
-for you to tell me something of that tremendous jour-
ney and what you discovered at its end 

  the woman smiled a far-away smile and some of
the wonders she had seen were mirrored in her gray
eyes then she shuddered as she recalled some of those
terrific experiences that had deprived her of her love
no one she said has ever heard the entire story of
what actually took place but i feel that it should be told
perhaps sometime when i can compose my
thoughts   

  kington recognized the uselessness of further urging
for he was never one to thrust demands upon those who
did not wish to comply for the second time he fell to
studying ezra-weit he could not get accustomed to the
boys strange coloring dorr again took up the conver-
sation for as he had already said he had come to earth
with a definite purpose and he wished to lose no time
in getting down to business he spoke now at length
about his adopted world explaining many of its features
to his one-time chum

  it has taken us almost twenty years to erase preju-
dice of race from abrui wally but at last the three
races golden silver and bronze men dwell in harmony
side by side and we hope in time with the blending of
the three to develop true brotherhood of spirit now
they have sent me as emissary back to my own world

in hope that fellowship may be established between our
two great worlds much has abrui to offer earth in
the way of barter just as earth can give fair exchange
to abrui

what fields you open up dick its-why-its
almost beyond human conception lamely ob-
served the renowned scientist tell me something of
abruis needs you say that she has untold deposits
of radium our own progress in various lines of en-
deavor suffer because we have so little in what state
is it found-in uranium or some of the compounds

  it is in a raw state and much of its sources are un-
tapped  to the abruian it is what fire is to us now
what abrui needs most is iron and nickel which are
sadly lacking strange to say although there is plenty
of lead which is of course both the parent and the off-
spring of radium and although the abruians are most
able in making use of that soft heavy metal alloyed with
other metals they need iron for steel and lighter ma-
terials aluminum is unknown

  however abrui is far more interested right now to
learn of your newest developments in the field of radio
transmission radio is a very new science on the planet
introduced as it was by dana when she sought to send
out messages to the professor she failed to reach him
but the abruians seized upon the invention for although
they are as far developed in most of the sciences as earth
more so in some wire and wireless transmitting was un-
known to them communication between nations and
cities was carried on entirely by letter and messenger
although they have developed a science that the people
of earth have as yet entirely overlooked that is the
science of mental telepathy so efficient are the abruians
that a mans mind is wholly open to his fellow-beings un-
less he wills it differently also it is possible for them
to project their thoughts in picture form upon screens
for all to see sometimes even to the next city much in
the same way as you are projecting by television today

  moura-weit was perhaps the greatest exponent of
this art and that is what added so greatly to his power
over his people he was able to detect the thoughts
of a man in the next room or house and he could alone
throw his thoughts forth for all to see whereas it is
difficult as a rule for two or three men with their com-
bined efforts to do this thing ezra-weit is fast learn-
ing to do likewise

  kingtons eyes again went to the strange youth but
as dorr continued speaking his attention reverted to
the speaker

  so you see when dana gave them the rudiments of
radio the abruians were wild with enthusiasm they
have made great strides with it but still they lack some
of its essentials mainly because of their lack of the
proper metals to bring about the proper changes nor
have they television since that was not invented when
we left earth twenty-five years ago and it is to earth
that they look for furtherance of their own develop-
ments in this great field i am certain that our fellow
men would be delighted to have an enlarged market for
their wares while they could in turn find use for many
of the abruian commodities in the world markets

  the abruians therefore would like to propose a
commercial interchange they will build a fleet of
space-flyers modeled after moura-weits ship the
yodverl the plans of which he gave freely to his world

   meaning ship of the void


amazing stories

who knows but that in a few years we will have a pas-
senger-line established whereby tourists from each of
the worlds can visit the other planet does that not
pique your imagination wally and dorr was grinning
broadly at the expression on the others face

  man alive the scientist exclaimed you are look-
ing upon the first passenger of the new service or per-
haps ill go as supercargo or even stowaway if neces-
sary 

  they all laughed together over the mans enthusiasm
it was hard to picture this rotund little man as a stow-
away

  come said he we must announce this great news
to the world but wait-it is late-far past the lunch-
eon hour i fear how inconsiderate ive been in keep-
ing you talking while you must be starving now now-
not another word until weve eaten as he spoke he
rang a bell and janson appeared for orders including
strict attention to the fact that no one not even the
king of england was to be admitted to the house for
the remainder of the day janson proved his worthiness
in that moment by announcing that he had had the chef
keep a luncheon ready to serve for the last hour and a
half and he led the visitors to rooms above where
they might prepare themselves for the mid-day meal

chapter v
the girl-element is injected

true to his word kington would not allow a
single word spoken of the future until the meal
was eaten but he in turn spent that time in enter-
taining his guests with a panorama of the worlds history
of the preceding twenty-five years much of which was
digested with wonder and astonishment by the two self-
exiled earthlings ezra listened avidly to the talk more
interested it appeared in things of earth than he had
been in those of his own familiar world however he
was never too interested in what was said to forget his
attentions to his mother whom he seemed to observe so
that her every wish was fulfilled without the need of a
word too he often asked a question in halting care-
fully enunciated words when something was not quite
clear to him janson struck by the youths queer ap-
pearance hovered around him as much as his duties of
serving would allow

  with the meal ended kington ushered his guests into
a drawing room a large chamber excellently furnished
in the newest prevailing fashion which considered bodily
comfort first there were many deep overstaffed
chairs well upholstered with tables set conveniently at
hand large windows admitted the afternoon sun and
gave the room a warm feeling the host saw to it that
his guests were comfortable before he himself took a
chair ezra found the cigarettes of his host to his liking
and dorr puffed on a havana cigar with enjoyment

  we have cigarettes on abrui now made from a leaf
that was found to be almost a counterpart of the to-
bacco leaf except that it makes a poor grade of cigar
the man said by way of apology for the attention he
was giving his smoke

  you must have found it very difficult at times to ad-
just yourself to the new world observed kington

  dorr nodded and his eyes took a dreamy look as he
recalled some of those adjustments he had been called
upon to make

  i have been wondering why you have neglected to
bring your wife back with you dick  or does she pre-
fer the new world 

  a sigh escaped the man she does prefer the new
world wally but she did want to come to earth how-
ever our people were adverse to both of us coming this
time perhaps they feared we should not wish to re-
turn to abrui so they trumped up a story that they
needed one of us while the other was gone you see
dana has done more than i have done for the planet
it has her heart and she loves it more than she ever
loved earth she had you know a strange life here
being raised as a boy all her life by a father who hated
all womankind so that when he died in the world war
she really had nothing to hold her to earth abrui truly
means home to her

  hence when we decided that one of us were to come
to earth dana insisted that i go since she believed i
could do more than she could here and i left her home
with our two children i wanted to bring the boy duris
but dana would not allow it he must wait instead
until dana can come with mural too and with an
air of enough of that dorr plunged into business

  now tell me wally have i come to the right per-
son when i called upon you to help us our ship lies
not more than sixty miles from here in a wild part of
the country where i trust it will escape detection until
the proper time aboard are twenty abruian men and
women whom i thought it best to bring along-for
proof-if there are none to believe our spoken word
and i place ourselves and them in your hands

  you may feel certain dick that this duty you have
placed on my shoulders is indeed a trust i shall do all
i can even though it seems almost too great for me the
program however lies with you in twenty-four hours
i can have some of the greatest of the worlds scientists
at your feet and another twenty-four hours will bring
the ruling heads of every nation to the call when the
truth is out what do you suggest shall we call only
a chosen few before the news is given to the public

  the next hour was spent in discussing plans elsie
rollins-weiti sat quietly by listening to what was said
now and then giving a good suggestion ezra however
paid them little heed boyishly his eyes had flown
around the room at the unfamiliar looking furnishings
ornaments and fittings and when he thought the others
too engrossed to notice him he got up from his chair
and wandered about inspecting various articles at close
hand so he had found the magnificent radio-set in the
far corner of the room that formed a small alcove

   seeing that the adults paid him no attention he sat on
a small chair and studied the formidable array of dials
and the neat little television screen set in its center to
one side was another smaller screen with two small dials
beneath it with an individual amplifier but he was diffi-
dent in inquiring of his host what that was for after
a few tries on the main dials of the instrument he
learned the combination and with its volume tuned low
so as not to disturb the others he twirled the dials to
find what was on the air one by one he found the
various broadcasting stations of the world and listened
to each program news reports music lectures orations
and drama and in fact the whole gamut of the broad-
casting world what interested him the most was the
television screen and as he watched the dancing the
posturing the moving figures of people an exclamation
of wonder escaped him now and then
across the void



an hour and a half passed in this fashion when
kington came to interrupt him the conference
of the three had broken up and it was time to get to
business excusing himself for interfering with the
boy kington turned the dials below the smaller machine
that had intrigued ezra-weit there was a moments
pause thence a silvery bell sounded and a light flashed
on the screen into which swam a face it was the face
of a venerable old man who smiled a greeting to the
scientist facing him unobtrusively ezra moved away
from the machine to allow the two to speak without his
interference joining his mother and richard dorr on the
other side of the room

   when the conversation was done dorr strolled over
 to his friend at the machine i take it he said that
 this is your new type of telephone eh they predicted
 it in my day rather clever i should judge

   yes was the rejoinder weve done away entirely
 with the old style telephone and use the wireless or
 radio type instead every set is provided with its own
 particular wave-length and by dialing the wave-length
 number of those we wish to speak with the central
 switchboard acts upon it as it did in the old days of
 course if the line is busy a buzz indicates it we
 call the machine the tele-vis-vox

   wonderful but tell me how can you keep another
 from listening in or do you sacrifice your privacy

   there is what is called the jumbled sound control
 and once the two parties are connected it is impossible
 for another to listen in as he will hear only distorted
 sounds of course for greater secrecy code is some-
 times used however as once the wires were controlled
 by licenced companies the air is now controlled by the
 various governments with an international governor
 presiding over all and only registered stations are given
 right of ways a special bureau is maintained to keep
 the air free of listeners in or amateur broadcasters
 so at no time are we bothered with illicit traffic of the
 air

   kington had other parties to call up and dorr
 stayed at his side as he addressed them when they
 were finished at the tele-vis-vox kington called for
 janson to whom he had orders to give mrs weiti
 was to be shown to a guest chamber where she might
 rest and there was to be a dinner at eight oclock for
 seven persons and on the pain of death no one was to
 be admitted to the house until the master had returned

   ezra-weit was asked if he should like to accompany
 kington and dorr upon the round of business that they
 had to attend but the youth shook his head he pre-
 ferred to stay in the house or to be more exact at
 the radio

   it was several hours before the two returned and
 with them were three strange men and a woman they
 were not strange to ezra however for they had been his
 companions on the journey from abrui each of the
 three men were representative of the three different
 races of their planet the golden silver and bronze pig-
 mented races of abrui they were by name respec-
 tively ulja-tai ubca-tor and kalu-tor the woman
 who was tabora or silver-hued was called alba-tais
 the suffix to the name indicated that the first was a
 crown-prince in direct line of the kiradaship or king-
 ship of his race the other two were princes of royal
 blood but with no connection to the throne the woman
 was a crown-princess but as women never succeeded to
 the throne on their world her name merely denoted that

she was the first-born daughter of the taboran kirada

  ulja-tai was a moatan or golden man hair and
skin and even the lips were golden-hued with only the
vermilion red of his eyes and the black pupils to relieve
that monotony of color he stood about six foot three
inches and was very slender of body broad shouldered
and narrow-hipped his features were fine and deli-
cately drawn forming a severe thoughtful face with
strong lines of repression around the golden lips such
a face one would expect to find in a man of a race that
had been held in slavedom for thousands of generations
and who now finds himself raised to a responsible posi-
tion during their centuries of thralldom the moata
had rigidly perserved their castes so that when freedom
came in the shape of richard dorr each man of them
had slipped easily into his rightful place without con-
fusion

  ulja-tai was clothed in true abruian style with tight-
fitting trousers that seemed molded to his limbs a loose
blouse that was sleeveless and square-cut at the neck
and hung half-way down the thigh trousers and smock 
were of a silkish cloth in vermilion that exactly matched
the shade of their wearers eyes a leather girdle gold-
colored and encrusted with many precious glistening
stones encircled the waist the leather sandals were of
a suede as soft as does skin and were laced half way
up the calf of the leg to the shoulders of the blouse
was attached a long cape that fell into deep folds to
within an inch of the heel and was full enough to allow
of its being drawn entirely about the body the cape
was lined with the skin of some strange animal that
was yellow with vermilion stripes

  ubca-tor the silver man was somewhat taller than
ulja-tai standing easily six-feet six inches like ezra-
weit he had the silver hair and skin of his race and the
lavender eyes but whereas ezras skin had more the ap-
pearance of his earthly forebears with only the sug-
gestion of a silvery tint underlying the surface ubca-
tor was all silver like a polished silver statue his
features were also regular and in his eyes there seemed
a sorrow lurking as if perhaps he were regretting the
future he was in fact the companion who had gone
with moura-weit in his exile and shared in all his ad-
ventures to the time of the others death and still he
sorrowed for his dead leader even as elsie rollins-weiti
suffered he was dressed as the golden man only his
costume was of a blue that blended well with his laven-
der eyes

  the third abruian kalu-tor of gora the bronze man
was by far the tallest of the three standing a good five
inches above ubca-tors head but the fact that he was
so heavily muscled made him appear squat beside his slen-
derer companions to kington he looked more natural
as a man since his bronze skin gave him the appearance
of the american indian to a certain extent except that
his long silky hair matched his complexion and his eyes
were practically hazel nor were his features as deli-
cately drawn as those of the golden and silver men but
there was wisdom in his face and a kindly look in his
eyes

  all three abruians were clean-shaven and all wore
their hair square cut at the chin with bangs on the fore-
head a close examination showed that they were
wholly beardless nor was there any sign of old age
among them no sagging muscles or graying hair to give
the impression of the years only the deep cut lines about
the mouth and the eyes themselves told that these were


amazing

stories

not young men the eyes expressing the story of the
years spent in gathering knowledge understanding and
sagacity

  the woman alba-tais resembled the men in that last-
named feature wisdom lay deeply in her eyes that
were more orchid than lavender but her body
showed nothing of age she was as straight and upright
as any immature girl although alba-tais could have told
you that she was the mother of several children she
was dressed identically like the men except that the
colors of her suit varied her blouse was of deep rose
and her trousers a rich old ivory and the jewels in her
girche were all black but glowing with the fire of the
diamond

  elsie rollins-weiti came down the stairs at the mo-
ment of the entrance of the party and greeted her fel-
low travelers warmly in their own tongue ezra had al-
ready drawn ubca-tor aside to show him the wonderful
radio set that kington owned then janson appeared
to announce dinner although for several moments he
was held speechless with surprise at the appearance of
his masters guests and for all that the servants were
fascinated by the strangers the dinner passed off fairly
well

  after they had repaired to the drawing room for
coffee and cigars several more guests were admitted to
the house these were four of kingtons confreres and
moran the prime minister of england the talk of
course resolved around abrui and the benefits to be
derived from earth by commerce with that distant
world it was late when the five made their departure
and kingtons guestswere taken to their rooms it was
a question as to where they could put the great bronze
man to bed for although the others could manage to
make themselves fit in the accommodations at hand
there was no bed to fit the gor he fixed it himself by
electing to lie on the floor and with a mattress and
pillows he was made comfortable at last

chapter vi
the mental powers of the abruians

what occurred during the following weeks is
the common knowledge of the school children
and there is little need of giving for each days
performances more than a cursory glance at what took
place in the city of london when the extraordinary
news of the arrival of the space-voyagers was given to
the public the first day was spent in acquainting the
scientists of the world with the news and of presenting
them with the proofs namely the abruians in evidence
and explaining to them what the abruians had to offer
to earth

  the second day brought together some of the greatest
heads of the earths many nations and then it was that
ezra-weit in company with several of his fellow-men
gave mental demonstrations of these we will speak
more fully for never before had the people of the world
seen such a phenomenon

  in the great hall where the meeting was being held a
large specially constructed screen was set upon the
platform it was opaque and it had been demonstrated
for the benefit of any doubting thomas that the screen
had no accompanying mechanisms thereupon the hall
was darkened and taking their places before the screen
ezra and ubca-tor sought to prove their mental powers

  at first it was difficult to distinguish the shape that
was taking form upon the screen it seemed dimmed and
distorted but slowly it cleared the screen itself grew
brighter as the youth and the older man gained mastery
over it and on it there was what appeared to be a round
terrestrial globe it had a small satellite moon hanging
not far above it while another more distant and smaller
moon shone as if from across a wide space those in
the auditorium realized it was not earth and dorr who
had taken his place on the platform explained in one
word abrui

  it could be noticed that the world was different from
earth in relief they saw its mountains plains and the
single ocean almost circular in shape with rough ir-
regular shorelines and a large island continent in its
center while far inland from the ocean a hundred and
fifty miles or so were ranges of rough mountains almost
encircling the whole ocean the low hanging globe that
had at first been taken for a moon was now glowing
with a warm rosy glow of its own giving its light to the
planet while the second moon so far and distant proved
to be old familiar sol shining as a moon on this distant
world less than a quarter the size it appeared from
earth

  that picture blurred now and another formed itself
until the audience was gazing down upon a landscape
a small portion of the world along an ocean shore the
country was comparatively flat except for a few sand-
dunes beside the water but several miles inland hills
began and the country presented a pretty rolling aspect
with the majesty of purplish mountains far in the back-
ground

  again the scene shifted and it showed a country under
cultivation large farmlands small park-like forests and
large pasturages lay below some sort of cattle were
grazing and the shapes of men working with machines
in the field were projected for all to see another change
and a city sprawled across the screen it was a unique
city built on the slope of a hill one side of which was a
sheer bluff with a drop of more than a thousand feet
to the serene river that came meandering through the
countryside atop the hill on what appeared to be its
crown a mile in circumference were erected a half a
dozen or so fine buildings of white stone which were
no more than one story in height but architecturally
presented beautiful graceful lines the buildings were
grouped so as to form three sides of a square and
around the buildings were spread beautiful gardens
the open side of the buildings faced the hills slope and
from them a broad flight of steps dropped down the
hill to the very foot

  dorr did not speak this time but somehow all those
in the auditorium realized the fact that they were gazing
down upon tunka the capital of the taboran nation
and that upon the hill-top dwelt the ruler and his family
and that here was also housed the parliamentary build-
ing and the quarters of the royal guard

  next they were looking down from the corona to the
city that swept terrace after terrace down the hill to the
plain below ten wide terraces were to be counted on
which were set lovely white houses with their gardens
and parks each terrace being divided from the one be-
low by a low wall covered with vines and greenery be-
low the last terrace was a high wall and on from it the
houses smaller less beautiful were set closer with
smaller gardens and smaller parks while only wide
avenues intercepted them these houses spread all
across the void



around the foot ot the hill until they met the shore of
the river on either side of the promontory and on either
side of the bluff two bridges causeway-like but with
draw-bridges set in their center spanned the river to
meet on the opposite side the wide undulating flats upon
which were dozens of long low buildings each a thous-
and feet by two thousand feet one story in height sym-
metrically placed with wide avenues to separate them
at the river were docks and large vessels resembling
the whaleback grain and ore- boats of the g rejit lakes
of the united states stood in the water

again those seeing this scene for the first time
understood as readily as though dorr had ex-
plained the meaning of all this they grasped the fact
that only the members of the nobility were permitted to
dwell in the fine homes on the terraces the commoners
in the city below that the terraces themselves were di-
vided as to rank the tors or princes occupied the ter-
races just below the hills corona the weits or baronets
perforce staying to the lowest terrace while again the
commoners also lived according to their castes separated
by the avenues only

  the fact that on abrui money was unknown came to
the spectators in the assembly even as the scenes had
presented themselves they understood that on abrui
a man was born to his rank as he was born to his
worldly possessions that were allotted him under govern-
mental supervision according to his caste the com-
moners provided the skilled and unskilled labor the no-
bility the leaders and supervisors yet with it all caste
was not so iron-clad that a laborer might not through
his efforts lift himself upward among the leaders and
onto the terrace only he did not lift his family with
him unless his peers made special dispensation for them

  once more the scene was changed and the large island
within the single sea of abrui swam into view this
was ora the seat of learning of the planet which being
neutral politically could not be prevailed upon by any
of the powers to work in their behalf singly here a
fugitive outcast or exile from one of the lands could
find sanctuary and he could not be extradited against his
will moura-weit had come here in his time and his
trouble and richard dorr and dana gleason of earth
administered to their adopted world from their seat on
this island and here came men and women from all
the planet to study and devote themselves to science
abruis greatest works were performed on ora ora
which knew neither caste nor class and where each was
permitted to follow what line of endeavor he chose for
himself as long as it was for the good of humanity the
simple lines of the hundreds of buildings that covered
the island attested to the fact that here was simplicity
of understanding carried to the nth degree

  there were even more scenic views of the planet
there were more cities like the first seashore and moun-
tain resorts universities mills factories mines and the
great plantations that lay on the other side of the moun-
tain ranges there was old goraland of wastelands
arid deserts swamps and jungles wherein dorr had
found the bronze men subsisting miserably before he
forced the tabora to give up a portion of their own
fertile well-watered lands to the gors who once civil-

  moura-weit had made himself ur-tor overprince once and had his
people thought he had gained that high position fairly his son would have
been born a tor instead of a weit on the retuvn of mounts wife and
son the taboranas had wished to dub them with princely rank but this
elsie rollins-weiti refused preferring to call herself weiti lady instead
as her husband had called himself weit after his exile

ized had become semi-barbarous under the conditions
which were forced upon them

  there were more scenes but now with each succeed-
ing view the screen was less clear sometimes it blurred
and grew indistinct then the screen became dark and
the lights of the hall were switched on again the show
was over ezra-weit and ubca-tor had taxed their
powers and could project no more people rose in their
seats and the acclaim was terrific the names of the
two were called loudly but they having slipped behind
the stage refused to appear

  richard dorr took the platform to explain that the
wonderful demonstration they had just been shown was
the product of the minds of the two who had given
it to them and although the performance might seem
miraculous to them it was a daily occurrence upon
abrui

chapter vii

the yodverl

the following day moura-weits mighty ship of
the void the yodverl was brought out of hiding
and was docked upon the great airport atop the
world air lines building first a small party of scien-
tists were taken aboard then officials from over the
world and at last the general public was permitted en-
trance but that soon became impossible hundreds of
hundreds and thousands of thousands had come flocking
to london to view the ship at first hand and to allow
them all to visit it personally would have necessitated
the ships lying in dock for months to come thereupon
all the world had to be satisfied with viewing it through
the television

  pictures are preserved for us today and there are the
accounts to be found in history books but for fear that
some detail has been forgotten we shall outline its
features here one thousand feet in length the yodverl
was cigar shaped and snowy white constructed of forty
layers of that serviceable abruian glass the shell was
stronger and more rigid than the diamond it had that
unique quality whereby those outside could not see
within but those in the ship at various vantage points
could see outside as clearly as through ordinary plate-
glass

  at each of the conical ends of the cigar were set the
great disks of the meteorite deflectors machines that
meant so much to the safety of the ship in space under
the port at the stern of the ship was set its airlock by
which voyagers could leave the flyer without affecting
the atmosphere within the ship when on an alien un-
tried planet but the main entrance lay in one side of
the machine about fifty feet from the yodverls nose
this doorway was circular and fitted so carefully as
to not be seen from the outside when closed but opened
upon invisible and intricate hinges revealing a cor-
ridor twenty-feet long into which the door itself fitted
perfectly when not in use the anteroom that this door
revealed was also the study and library of the flyer con-
taining thousands of abruian and earthly books for the
traveler as well as the ships log three doorways
opened from this chamber the first leading into the pilot
room that took up the entire forepart of the ship being
set directly in its nose here were the controls that di-
rected the flyer through space although the motors
were located far aft and here one had a clear un-


amazing stories

obstructed view of the heavens above and out in space
on either side and below

  on the floor forward or rather in the curvature
caused by the nose of the ship was set a great stellar
map that was highly interesting to the astronomer show-
ing the solar system in miniature and a small area of
the universe round about in proper proportion as to
size and distance to one side of the controls was an
odd arrangement of small round globes set in a circular
tank filled with a heavy liquid again these represented
the solar system sol and the system of the ten planets
known to abrui with their satellites and a number of
the largest asteroids intricate machineries controlled
the movements of the globes which showed at all times
the exact position of each planet in its relation to their
star even to the slightest deviation caused by the action
of each planet upon another this mechanism was in-
valuable to the interplanetary pilot as were dozens of
other instruments in the room that would have been
interesting only to the astronomer chronometers that
told solar and sidereal time on various worlds instru-
ments that felt out the dangers of space instruments of
all sorts and descriptions without which space-naviga-
tion would have been virtually impossible practically
all the instruments to be seen were the inventions of
moura-weit who had willed to his people all his effects
and on studying his achievements one has to concede
that he was possibly one of the greatest men of all
times

  the second door of the ante-room opened into the
laboratory where one was to find more intricate and
delicate instruments for various uses here was the
venerian telescope whose complicated lenses made it
available for use within the twenty foot deep shell of
the yodvcrl and there were more intricate and delicate
instruments for various uses here the scientist had
developed most of his works his gravity nullifier his
meteorite repeller the ships own gravitational field
here he had accomplished the last steps of developing
solids from the ether stream and here were to be found
three uncompleted machines that the inventor had not
finished at the time of his death one of these appeared
to be a super-radio set but was in truth the beginnings
of the machine that is so useful to us of today the solid-
transformer that sends solids from one locality to an-
other by translating them into their atomic vibrations
and reassembling them again into their specific forms
at their destination luckily moura-weit had left his
notes so that his son ezra could succeed in completing
it for the use of the two worlds of abrui and earth

the third door leading from the anteroom opened
to the living quarters of the ship in fitting out his
vessel moura-weit had copied the appointments of his
own home as exactly as he could so on entering one
found himself immediately within the confines of a typical
abruian home the first chamber the atol was identi-
cal with the living room of the earth home for here the
family gathered when the days work and fun was over
but the abruian atol serves more purposes than the
drawing room of our homes it was also the recreation
room as well as the dining room resembling the ancient
roman atrium in some respects the room was thirty
feet wide and forty long and in its center was a small
swimming pool in the middle of which a tiny fountain
played potted flowers of abrui grew around its edge
and on the mosaic tile floor were arranged wide comfort-

able couches and a number of abruian metal three-
legged chairs far more comfortable than our own the
walls of the room were ten feet in height and were
also tiled depicting a typical abruian landscape scene
with a city on one hillandthe two suns sol and tradr
and the satellite in the midday sky

  the ceiling of the chamber was the clear white glass
of abrui the inner skin of the ships shell and here we
come across the strangest features of all of abrui fire
to them is of little use because of their great deposits of
radium and radium also supplants electricity radium
alone spells power upon abrui thus by treating the glass
roofs of their homes with a radium solution the abru-
ians force their suijto do double duty for them the
radioactive quality of radium is such that during the day
the sunlight is absorbed by it and at night becoming
flourescent it gives off the light thus received when the
sun sets just as phosphorus gives off light when dark-
ness sets in  by imbedding tiny invisible wires through
the glass it is possible to switch off this light when re-
quired by arresting the action of the radium particles
so in the case of the yodverl its entire one thousand
foot length with it twenty-foot shell was in truth a
great storage battery absorbing heat and light when in
the suns glare dispensing it with the coming of dark-
ness

  the second room beyond the atol was called the dof
and was the inner private room of the family the dof
like the atol had tiled walls picturing a more intimate
scene in a garden with the life-like figures of men
women and children in their leisure moments flowers
grew about the walls so that they appeared to blend into
the picture itself or rather it made the observer feel
as though the painted figures would soon turn to speak
to him

 beside the two entrance doors at either end of the
chamber one from the anteroom the other opening to a
long corridor beyond there were also six doorways on
either side of the room three on either side these
gave access to the sleeping chambers four of these
rooms were of small size plainly though neatly fur-
nished with a wide sleeping couch a chair a chest of
drawers and a full length mirror the walls were of
creamy tile but it was the fifth room that proved most
interesting here two of the smaller rooms had been
sacrificed to the larger one which was furnished in a
wonderful fashion as though for a queen one who
knew the story of the two lovers understood im-
mediately that moura-weit with loving hands had fash-
ioned that room for his wife elsie rollins when she
followed him into the void

  from the dof a wide corridor ran for fifteen feet
or so with doors lining the walls the first two doors
one on either side of the hall proved to be bath-rooms
with everything installed for the comfort of the traveler
but the remainder of the doors were the entrances to
large storerooms a small placard on each door naming
the articles contained therein in abruian writing at
the end of the corridor a doorway opened into the ships
galley and kitchen here again had been a surprise for
the first earthlings who saw it for in truth the kitchen
was a revelation had the abruians nothing more to
offer than their unique cooking and refrigerating units
they would have found a ready market on earth as in-
deed they did no longer need the housewife of our
planet cry out against the drudgery of the kitchen as of
yore she need only to drop the food in the neat radium-
across the void



treated glass dish and minutes thereafter see each in-
dividual portion cooked to a turn

  yet one can imagine the wonder of the first to enter
here to see the unkitchenlike appearance of the ships
galley with nothing more than the plain clean walls of a
room no more than eight feet square in view but which
the twist of a little switch on one wall revealed in all
its mechanical wonder its walls disappeared as if by
magic with row after row of shelves appearing instead
on which were arranged dishes of all shapes and de-
signs all of glass all snowy white to one side stood
the refrigerator enclosed entirely in glass holding
fruits and vegetables that had made the trip from abrui
as fresh as the day they had been picked and yet with-
out revealing any machinery nothing to keep the viands
in their excellent state of preservation again it was the
radium that gave a cold-control as well as the heating
devices frozen drinks ice-cream all could be produced
as easily as the cookery was performed only the in-
sides of the dishes were so treated as we know so that
one could hold within the hand the dish as it cooked a
toothsome dinner

  beyond the kitchen of the yodverl lay the small stable
in which were housed the small herd of muti abruian
cows resembling somewhat our deer that were always
carried by the space-travelers to provide them with
fresh milk since no amount of refrigeration will keep
the liquid fresh and its vitamines intact to the abru-
ian milk is as necessary to his diet as bread is to the
earthman at the present time the yodverl was carry-
ing eleven of the pretty deer-like creatures the bull
of this particular herd was the descendent of the first
mitu to have been born on moura-weits first journey to
earth twenty years before

  mitu have never grown familiar to earth since we
have sufficient bovines of our own breeding to meet our
demands and besides the earthmen have never felt the
need of having to introduce the talking beasts of abrui
to our world as one knows the abruians had long
since discovered the language of their domesticated cow
as they have of most their beasts and therefore are able
to converse with them to a small extent however as
the mentality of the beasts is of a low degree the
language is very simple and very little informative

  beyond the stable which was kept as neatly as the
rest of the ship another corridor continued on through
more storerooms to the air-lock and into the motor-room
where the small radium motors were locked away

chapter viii
the results of the great conference

after the preliminaries with the introduction of
the abruians and their ship were gone through

-	the greatest conference the earth had ever known
was held and before the week was up arrangements for
a commercial line to ply between earth and abrui had
been completed once the earth people had recovered
from their excitement and wonder the business went
swiftly what held up the signing of the articles for the
new commission was the refusal at first of the abruians
to agree to sell to earth a single one of their interplane-
tary machines however it was dorr who brought
peace to the conference by signing a treaty that was
agreeable to both parties

  it was agreed therefore that a committee made up

of both earthling and abruian ambassadors were to
have complete control over the building of the machines
allowing but a limited number of the flyers to be built
at any time and thus make it certain that neither world
could commandeer a single machine for its own pur-
pose to the world court of earth the plans and blue-
prints of the machines were to be submitted to be kept
under lock and key so that if ever the abruians were to
break their contract the people of earth would have
the means of protecting their own planet men of both
worlds were to share in building the machines and as
improvements were incorporated in the ships themselves
these changes were to be recorded on the blue-prints held
by earth furthermore five ambassadors from earth
were to take up residence with their families on abrui
while the same numbers of abruians were to do like-
wise on earth thereby knitting the two worlds more
closely together

  in later years when bitter arbitration was to arise
between the two planets over their trade monopolies the
wisdom of dorrs treaty was to prove itself but that of
course does not concern the present history we do
realize the benefits of this inter-exchange between the
two worlds today and we ought to be thankful to the
far-sighted vision of that great statesman who made it all
possible with affairs as they are with the slow as-
similaton of the various races of both earth and abrui
we can see the day when the two great worlds will be
true brothers under the skin ezra-weit son of the
abruian moura-weit and of the woman of earth elsie
rollins is a fair example of what the two great races
of each world have to offer it may take many hun-
dreds even thousands of years but in the meantime we
see the increasing flow of tourists from both worlds the
migrations and emigrations from one planet to the other
the firm establishments of earthmen on abrui and
abruians on earth

  there are no people more affable and deserving of
friendship than the abruians no people more kindly
and more courageous or inventive looking about us
and seeing all the improvements in our own everyday
life brought to us from abrui we can only be thankful
to the greatest scientist of all professor ezra rollins
who made this possible when he dispatched dana glea-
son and richard dorr out into the void

  but to return to the day we all recall twenty years
before this the advent of the graf zeppelin piloted by
doctor hugo eckner had created a furor throughout the
world but it could not compare in any way to the ex-
citement when the yodverl left the world air lines
port to return homeward with the good news of the
affiliation between earth and that distant world abrui

  it was a bright summers day when the great ship rose
into the blue sky with the ohs and ahs of the multi-
tudes below accompanying it its great length seeming
to fill the heavens as it reflected the bright glare of the
sun on the upturned faces there were to be greater
ships in the service between the planets many times
larger than the yodverl which was to be their model in
fact the first ships of the fleet two thousand feet in
length are now dwarfed by the gigantic leviathans that
cross the void weekly but to those watching the yod-
verl rising into the skies it was thought great enough

  never before had there been such a celebration as
that the yodverl was carrying a number of the latest
in radio instruments and for seven hours after leaving
the earths atmospheric blanket the abruians were


amazing stories

enabled to listen to the program broadcast in its honor
today when radio transmission is carried across the in-
tervening  miles of space the seven-hour
program appears to us a poor feat but to the earth

people it was then a fine tribute to their science and
taught that sound could travel through space despite all
correctly worked-out theories to the contrary and so lead
to the ultimate success in that field

part ii

the love of moura-weit

chapter i

it was some weeks later on the island of ora on
the planet abrui that there was a gathering of
familiar faces there was dana gleason and rich-
ard dorr formerly of earth but now heart and soul of
abrui elsie rollins-weiti also of earth and her son
ezra-weit and there was walter kington late of
earth that planets first ambassador to abrui ubca-tor
was there also but he kept himself far back in the deep-
ening shadows

  they were all seated in the lovely gardens of dana
gleason and richard dorrs home on the island con-
tinent

  tradr the satellite sun had just then sunk below
the horizon in a burst of glory but old sol gave a
silvery radiance to the scene neither mercury venus
nor earth could be picked out of the firmament because
of their proximity to the sun they were rarely ever seen
from abrui and then only pin points of light here
the planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune were
more in prominence great jupiter glowed like a tiny
half-moon in the distance saturn with his rings was
brighter but of them all the great green planet of
neptune lay like a monster sickle but a degree away
from sol

  there was a discussion in the garden in which dana
gleason a handsome matron with but a faint show of
gray in her black hair was apparently the leading factor
yes elsie she was saying i quite agree with mr
kington dick and ezra that it is only right that you
repeat the tale of your adventures with your revered
husband moura it really belongs to the history of
earth and abrui for never has there been a greater
figure than moura-weit in all time and he belongs to us
almost as much as to you we certainly ought to know
more about him

  here under these familiar stars of his he would be
glad to have you repeat the past only tell us and i
myself will write it down later so that all of our worlds
can know their benefactor better

  a slow gentle smile wreathed the lips of the woman
of the void as the abruians were wont to call moura-
weits widow slowly she glanced about the circle at
its various members her eyes lingered longest on the
face of her son then crept beyond the group to where
ubca-tor moura-weits closest friend sat on a bench de-
tached from the others it was to his nod that she re-
sponded before she began to speak she was silent a
moment and seemed to collect her thoughts

  all right dana if you put it that way it is only right
that i do what you wish only remember that at best
i am a poor hand at story-telling i wish i had the
power to present the tale to you mentally but that is
beyond me

  you need not apologize to us elsie we know the
telling will be hard for you

the story

almost all of you began elsie were at one time
acquainted with moura-weit you knew him

-	as a man who was set apart from other men be-
cause he was made of other things than men are made
of a man whose brain had delved into every science
and who took from the minds of his fellowmen all that
he required for himself once when he was young
he had made the mistake of being too ambitious and
in his ambition was prepared to break any man or
woman who stood in his way but he had learned in a
hard school where he had erred and the remainder of
his life was spent in considering others instead of him-
self everything he did henceforth was done for the
good of humanity expiation for his early sins and he
died because he sought to save another from making
the same hideous mistakes he himself had made he
crossed the outer void to accomplish that deed

  when moura came to the little bungalow on the
african veldt where uncle ezra and i had continued
to live quietly since that memorial night when dana and
dick had departed ostensibly for mars the wounds in
his heart had not yet been healed moura was just learn-
ing the truth about himself and was hurt by what he had
discovered in turn i hated him thoroughly when he
told us the part he had played in the lives of our friends
his villainous attitude toward them but i pitied him too
for in his eyes was all the suffering he had been through
in bringing to the professor word from dana and dick
word that they were safe and happy at last he had
forged the first links in the chain that bound him to his
new self

  moura had not wished to tell us his name after re-
lating the story of the adventures of the two earthlings
on abrui in which he had figured so strongly as villain
that he had all but ruined their chances for happiness
and all but ruined a world but he was too much a man
to lie when uncle ezra asked his name so he had given
us the truth again he had no desire to carry us with
him into space he wished for no other companionship
as yet but that of his one true friend the golden man
who preferred exile with him to freedom with his people
on abrui yet he conceded to the old scientists wishes
because he was able to appreciate what it meant for the
old professor to have the chance to see at first hand the
universe he had known only through the telescope

  there were five of us in the yodverl when it headed
away from earth ubca-tor moura-weit urto uncle
ezra and myself the ship as you know is readily
piloted by a single man for once out of the confines of
a world the controls are locked the pilot only being
necessary when the ship was passing through dangerous

  on abrui is the legend that moura-weit was not born of flesh but
was the offspring of a group of scientists who believed the foundation of
life is thought and through their combined efforts had brought forth a
child without the aid of flesh endowing him with the power of their own
brains and because of his extraordinary powers the abruians liked to
think that moura-weit was that child because of his seeming supernatural
power of invention and perception in speaking here his wife may have
intended to convey such a thought  but it is more likely that she was
referring merely to the fact he was in truth a superman
across the void



areas filled with meteorites or aerolites at these times
all three of the abruians took their spells urto could
manage the ship as well as moura or ubca

  when richard dorr freed the golden men of moata
from their slavery to the tabora urto might have gone
free too being a prince in his own name but like ubca
he had preferred exile with moura both of them would
have laid their lives down for him if the need was ever
to arise urto did try to save moura when he fell on
the planet kal but though he died he was unable to
save his master

  as for myself i could not help but admire the man
moura even though i detested him for what he had al-
most done to my friends on abrui he was a handsome
man judging from both earth and abrui standards with
an arresting personality that forced one to like him re-
gardless of what he had done or failed to do here
dana gleason nodded affirmatively later i was to
know what it meant to love him far more intensely than
i hated him but that did not come immediately

  i had not wanted to go on this trip from earth i
dreaded it fearful of what could happen out there in
space but uncle ezra would have it no other way he
had told me i was free to stay home but of course i
would not allow him to go without me he had been
mother and father to me the only person who belonged
to me in fact he was an old man already when he had
sent the rocket to mars and the years during which he
awaited the message from dana had aged him more than
the years should have done now i had the feeling
that he was not to return to earth alive

chapter ii
sunward

you all know as much about the mechanics of the
yodverl as the interplanetary commission are
willing for you to know as much as i do in fact
for i am not a scientist enough to understand it all fully
we do know that after years of study moura had dis-
covered that each planet each sun tosses off vibratory
impulses into space vibrations that moura carefully has
plotted for us and which the simple radium motors of
the yodverl are attuned to as a magnet is attuned to its
lodestone and attracted to it as uerringly as the arrow
goes to the bulls eye magnetic streams we call them

  uncle ezra had asked that first we visit sol as close
as it was humanly possible to go and moura had set his
intricate dials allying his ship to the vibratory impulses
of the sun as yet there were no gravity nullifiers on
the yodvcrlr so the ship had to depend wholly upon the
suns attraction to draw us from earths bosom which
as moura explained to us was not entirely dependable
as long as we were within earths blanket which tended
to shut away much of the impulses consequently our
trip through the earths blanket was not overly pleas-
ant for we went in jerks and starts that threw us from
our balance as earth intervened continually seeking
to hold us to her once it seemed as if earth should
surely regain us as we went into a fall of several thou-
sand feet but moura at the dials quickly switched them
from the sun to the moon gleaming there in the night
sky the change steadied us and the meters told us
we were rising properly

  moura suggested now that both uncle and i retire to
couches in the atol so that we should not suffer too in-
tensely from space-sickness that would be brought upon

us by the change from earths gravitational pull to a
weightless condition the abruians were accustomed to
these changes but we would feel its full force uncle
ezra did not wish to leave the pilot room but i went
docilely enough and i was glad to hide my face in the
cushions in the attempt to forget what was happening

  i must have fallen asleep for a while for when i be-
came aware of my surroundings i felt horribly sick so
sick that i wanted to die then and there i could not
open my eyes for the room would spin around and
around then i had the sensation as though i had been
strapped down with heavy bonds and could not move a
muscle this sensation persisted for a number of min-
utes became certain reality so again i essayed to open
my eyes to peer about the room was steadier this time
and sure enough i saw i was bound down to the couch
with heavy straps one across my chest the other across
the thighs what could it mean frantically looking
about i saw on the couch near at hand that uncle ezra
had been dealt with in the same manner

  thoroughly frightened i sought the answer had we
been made prisoners in our sleep but why were we
not prisoners enough on this space-ship quaking with
fear i did not know what i awaited my vigil was not
for long urto appeared in the doorway he carried
a tray on which he was holding two long rubber blad-
ders and he was smiling

  in astonishment i watched him approach for never
had i seen a man walk as he walked strange slow
slithering walk in which he did not raise his feet from
the floor he came in this fashion to the side of my
couch and i shrank away from him as far as my straps
would allow now certain that he must be drunk or out
of his head for he had taken one of his rubber bladders
from his tray which he had set down on the floor care-
fully then held it toward my face i started to struggle
while he was saying something in a soothing voice
he spoke but a few words in english and those were
unintelligible to me-until later when i had learned to
understand him better now the situation was made
more horrible for i thought i was in the hands of a
madman while he sought to fasten the bladder over
my mouth and nose i strove to evade it by turning from
side to side

  all the while he was seeking to soothe away my fears
to coerce me into submitting to his ministrations i
might have screamed but so intent was my struggle i
never thought to use my voice and at last he succeeded
in accomplishing what he wished when the open mouth
of the bladder was over my mouth and nose there was
nothing for me to do but to try to breathe and in breath-
ing i was doing what he wanted me to do i was taking
into my lungs the contents of the bladder it was a
sweetish clean odor that came to me then the bladder
was empty and i was choking for air quickly urto re-
moved it from my face and then busied himself in re-
moving the straps that held me down immediately i
was surprised at the feeling of well-being that filled me
all sickness was gone and i felt as free and light as
thistle-down sitting up suddenly i was shocked to find
myself shooting from the couch straight into the center
of the room and up until my head met the ceiling

urto seemed to have expected just such a move-
ment on my part and i felt him grasp one of my
feet as he pulled me down to the floor again standing
shakily on my feet i understood it all and began to laugh


amazing stories

-to laugh until the tears came urto laughed in com-
radely fashion with me first he had strapped me down
to the couch so i would not go floating off from it
in my present weightless condition then he had only
sought to settle my stomach with the inhalation of the
mixed gases in his rubber bag and i silly fool had
misunderstood it all

   at that moment ubca-tor appeared in the doorway
 and came with a dragging walk towards us to inquire
 solicitously as to my condition i told him how great
 i felt and as urto turned to minister to uncle ezra
 who had just opened his eyes we watched the opera-
 tion the old professor showed no surprise at what was
 done to him and then he was on his feet exclaiming at
 what a wondrous sensation it was to be without weight
 between the two of them ubca and urto taught us
 the first rudiments of space-walking we were very
 awkward at first and more often than not had to reach
 for a support left alone we might easily lose our
 equilibrium and go floating off to the ceiling then to
 settle in the center of the chamber between floor and
 ceiling with nothing near to cling to for the first few
 days the two of us kept the abruians busy rescuing us
 we had instead to learn to control our every move-
 ment to walk slowly and not to make a too sharp turn
 or gesture later we accomplished the feat of air-
 swimmingso thatwith flaying arms and legs we could push
 ourselves through the weightless air to some destination

   presently by taking our arms ubca and urto led us
 to the pilot room where moura awaited us looking
 through the clear glass of the pilot room i was non-
 plussed by what i saw no one can picture that awful
 wonder of space and when i saw earth dwindled in
 size so that i could no longer make out the shape of its
 continents i cried out in pain there was the moon in
 quadrant slowly moving on its way beside earth grow-
 ing smaller and smaller as we drew away later as
 the distance grew greater earth commenced to become
 slightly luminous and the wonder and beauty of the
 aurora with its glorious streams more than several
 thousand feet in height was an inspiring sight

   and now the sun was shining full upon us so brightly
 it hurt the eyes to look at the great globe later a
 black curtain had to be drawn around the walls of the
 pilot room else the light and heat there would have be-
 come intolerable in the living quarters it was better
 since the light shone through the walls above obliquely
 and we received only the afterglow of course only the
 forepart of the ship was receiving the full blast of the
 sun and the radium treated shell was gathering the
 energy to store away for further use or to redistribute
 so as to keep the ship at an even temperature through-
 out

   as you are aware the energy from the sun does not

 	actually come to us as heat the waves merely carry
 the energy which becomesheat only when it acts on or
 against a substance that is capable of translating it as such
 a black rough surface does not reflect the heat and the
 waves will pass through a transparent object without
 warming or lighting it and but for the fact that there
 were solids in our ship we would have received neither
 heat nor light as it was the rear of the ship had none
 of this but felt the bitter cold and darkness of space so
 it required an intricate system of heating and refrigera-
 tion to keep the ship comfortable throughout its length
 at all times however as we drew nearer and nearer sol

 less heat was needed and more frigeration was used in-
 stead else we could not have stood the close approach to
 the sun

  day after day slipped by as we neared sol and we
were all filled with wonder at the great yellow body
here was no atmosphere to refract the rays and it was
possible to study the great sunspots by the hour and to
chart their courses for this was a year of many magnetic
storms on the star above and all around us were the
distant stars of the galaxy the milky way the won-
drous sash girdling the whole cosmos the more bril-
liant stars sirius capella vega canopus alpha cen-
tauri betelgeuse and others sparkled and shone like
jewels unblinkingly brilliant and glowing in all their
natural colors of red yellow green violet orange steel-
blue and blue-white each constellation showed in all its
perfect beauty and we could see clearly the component
parts of a number of the doube stars or binaries the
clouds of the milky way were glorious formations mak-
ing bright the otherwise black night making us feel just
how small we of the almost insignificant planet earth
and of abrui were here were the five of us daring
the infinite sheltered by walls of glass small atoms
in the worlds of immensity

  venus lay far to the right of us and we were barely
able to make out mercury against the splendor of the
suns corona but soon venus was passed by and gradu-
ally the diminutive mercury detached himself from the
limb of sol to allow us to see him more clearly and to
think what life would be on that hot-cold little world

  on leaving earth we were traveling at the leisurely
rate of one hundred and fifty miles per second moura
feared to travel any faster than that in approaching the
sun for of course sols power is tremendous and once
we were in his grip it was a question as to whether
or not we could have pulled out as it was we never
fully headed toward him and upon coming within about
twenty million miles or so of him we veered away and
then commenced the journey around his great bulk using
his emanations now as a brake against him the jour-
ney around the star was short and throughout the trip
the ship rocked as if in a heavy gale the sight that
met our eyes when we dared to look for a short space of
time was a terrible one after one or two glances
through the mirror moura had rigged up in the pilot
room it would have been impossible to look directly
at the sun and keep our eyes intact i gleaned most of
my knowledge of that sight from the copious notes
uncle ezra afterwards wrote he had brought a num-
ber of note books as well as several astronomical in-
struments with him with which he had busied himself
during the entire trip and for hours thereafter he did
nothing but write upon his new discoveries of the sun-
spots mighty prominences chromosphere reversing
layer and photosphere

  as far as we knew we were the first living beings to
have ever approached so close to sol perhaps others
from mars or some of the moons of jupiter or saturn
had come before us but here there were no monuments
to mans achievements and none to answer our ques-
tions had we not donned dark insulated clothing as
well as the dark glasses we could not have come through
with a whole skin for now the glare was coming through
the ceiling of the living quarters and the heat was at
broiling point when we withdrew from the suns di-
rect rays we found our skins badly burned with all
that and for two days we were partially blinded but
across the void



it was worth the experience to see the delight in the
pale eyes of the old scientist

chapter iii

swinging away from the sun now at a tangent
we headed for mercury which lay on an angle
from us at about thirty million miles uncle was
anxious to explore there and we all felt a need of a rest
upon terra firma no matter how uninviting it might be
so far i have failed to mention some of the dangers we
had to pass through in approaching sol dangers that
would no longer be present but that was before moura
had invented the meteorite deflector in passing into
the area surrounding sol we found on the entire trip
there and outward to mercury that every minute we
were in danger of being struck by the space stones free
agents torn from stars or surging through space by
themselves and caught in the grip of sol they came
plunging toward him at terrific speeds to fall like peb-
bles into the burning heart of the great star

  a lookout had had to watch continually so we could
dodge these stones two of which had been the size of
small moons but on turning in the direction of mercury
we ran into a swarm luckily there were no large ones
in the mass none measuring more than six feet or so
in diameter with most of them from a few inches across
to about one or two feet ubca who was at the controls
dodged the larger fragments and we could hear the
smaller ones ofttimes impinging against the yodverls
sides but we did not worry about them for they could
do no damage to our glass shell however we were
glad when we passed the swarm

  i have already spoken slightly of the experience of a
weightless condition and its inconvenience in moving
about the ship but that was really the least of our
troubles once we had learned to adapt ourselves to the
change we had our humorous moments too and i
had to laugh every time i attempted to sit in a chair for
it actually took physical force to draw oneself down to
the seats level and hold oneself there

  all furniture was fastened to its place on the floor and
thence straps were added so that once seated one could
stay put for unless this precaution were taken after
a moment or so the seatee might find himself floating
away to the center of the room there to retain the same
position of sitting with the difference of not having
the support of the chair in sleeping the same thing
was applicable one had to be strapped to the couch or
else awake to find the couch several feet below if he
had happened to move in his sleep i do not think
that anyone not even moura ubca or urto can ever
become entirely accustomed to the vagaries of living
in the completeness of a weightless condition i cant

  in the matter of controlling liquids more difficulties
arose liquids as you know take the form of a sphere
when weightless and are subject to their own forces of
cohesion and surface tension and only striking a wetted 
surface will follow that and spread over it for ex-
ample our weightless water in a partly filled bottle will
not occupy the bottom but will leave the center empty
as the liquid flows around the sides of the vessel the
most difficult thing consequently is to empty the bottle
once it is filled and naturally it is impossible to leave
water in an open vessel for as more surface becomes
wetted the water will spread out of its container ad-
hering to every new surface it encounters

  for this reason the water from the pool in the atol
had been drawn off on leaving earths gravity and the
floor and walls had been thoroughly dried it was
urtos business to look after this matter as well as to
prepare our meals and in this he was unucually in-
genious for instance by using mechanical force he
was able to direct the water from the vats into rubber
bladders that he kept for that purpose then he would
placc the bladders in the refrigerator until the water was
solid so that it was possible to chip off the amount he
needed remelting it in smaller wide-necked rubber tubes
or bottles in cooking he perforce used covered dishes
entirely

  we on the other hand had to drink the water from
these same rubber bottles by putting the mouth to our
mouths and by pushing or squeezing its end force the
liquid into our throats if perchance the water escaped
from the bottle it would assume its spherical shape and
to capture it again we had only to place a dish against
it and allow it to spread over the dish as else we could
walk up to it grasp it with our lips and suck it into
our mouths once it was in the mouth we had to use
the tongue to force it into the throat and there the me-
chanical action of the muscles of the throat esophagus
and stomach would do the rest

  in bathing ourselves we had only to liberate a small
sphere from one of the rubber bottles dip our face and
hands into it then soap could be lathered on more
water added to rinse it and then all could be wiped away
with a towel the same was true in bathing the body
although we had to be careful to keep it from spreading
to all parts of the room for this we used a rubber bag
that was fastened both to the floor and ceiling and into
which we enclosed both ourselves and the water only
we had to be careful that the head did not become en-
tirely submerged else we would have drowned then
and there

  so you can see that with all these difficulties we were
gladdened over the prospect of descending upon the
planet mercury unenticing as it was

mercury turns its axis once in each of its years
and therefore presents one side to the sun at all
times as it makes its single rotation about that star a
rotation of eighty-eight days the surface facing the
sun thereby attains a terrific degree of heat while its
dark face equals the cold of eternal night since its at-
mospheric blanket is too slight to carry any of the heat
received on one side to the other and in that portion
of the globe where the light and dark meet is the one
place where man can hope to put foot and survive here
ubca directed the ship

  uncle ezra was of the opinion he might find life
here and he wanted to make his everlasting observations
ubca discovered below us a fairly level piece of ground
to which we made our way never have i seen a more
gloomy weird and gruesome landscape the ground
itself was lividly white in the glare of our lights and
here and there appeared small purplish growths of some
sort in that uncle was right he found life on
mercury but only that simple specimen that was organic
but hardly lifelike

  as we had drawn near we could feel the pull of
mercurys gravity slight though it was compared to that
of earth its mass was but  against the  of earth
while its surface gravity was  instead of  thus
a body belonging to earth loses over two-thirds of its


amazing stories

weight upon landing on the smaller planet but that slight
gravitational power was enough to hold water down to
its level and we were to have the pleasure of seeing the
pool fill up again the water had more buoyancy as
ive may term it than on earth a drop flung into the
air went higher and did not fall so rapidly

  as soon as the yodverl was safely landed we all
donned bathing suits and headed for the pool the
abruians are great swimmers spending much of their
time in their pools as you know and it was a great in-
convenience to moura ubca and urto to be deprived
of their swims while in space uncle ezra was for go-
ing outdoors immediately but moura forbade that he
recommended that for the next twelve hours at least
we all take a complete rest and since our eyes and
bodies were sore from the treatment we had had from
old sol mouras suggestion was properly given even
uncle ezra saw the wisdom of this and submitted grace-
fully though all the while he was aching to be out ex-
ploring the gloomy terrain beyond the ship

  urto had retired directly to his kitchen and shortly
thereafter came forth bearing a tray of food grinning
broadly because at last things placed down stayed down
so after our plunge we ate our first mercurian meal
able to drink water propeily and not have to hold the
food on our plates with the cutlery a little later we
all retired for the most refreshing and wholesome sleep
we had had in a week at mouras suggestion i rubbed
myself down with his healing salve so that when i
awoke all the soreness of the sunburn was gone

  on awakening we went for another swim this time
i went into the kitchen to help urto in the days past
i had learned all of his culinary art and taught him some
earthly tricks of cookery and thereafter i shared a
great deal of the work of keeping the ship in order for
i could not sit quietly with hands folded neither moura
nor ubca were averse to giving urto aid in his tasks
as he sometimes shared the piloting of the ship with
them and he was a handy man in mouras laboratory
in fact except that he waited on us there was never
anything to show that he was the servant the only way
in which he actually differed from the others was that
he knew scarcely a word of english so it was difficult
for me to converse with him but as i had already taken
up the study of abruian for the want of something
better to do we were soon to overcome that handicap
all three abruians were glad to teach me the words of
their language

  at last much to the relief of uncle ezra moura was
ready to go with him to investigate the planet i had
no desire to go out into the desolate world nor had ubca
the inclination but urto elected to accompany the others
from the pilot room ubca and i watched their progress
through the twilight where only their torch lights illu-
minated the way the sun appeared as a great orange
ball on the horizon never seeming to change its position
at all

  going out to the airlock the three had donned the
hermetically sealed suits that were used for outside wear
and made them look all the world like deep sea divers
after dressing the air was pumped from the lock and
a sample of mercurys atmosphere taken it was found
too poor for human consumption containing a very
small percent of oxygen mercurys thin atmosphere
is due to the fact that the little planets surface gravity
is insufficient to retain a viery extensive envelope uncle

  ezra was aware of this truth since he knew the albedo
  of mercury to be but  but he had wished to prove
  this for himself

    with this test completed the outer door of the lock
  was opened and the three stepped upon the bleak world
  we saw them go stumbling over the rough uneven
  ground now and then stooping to study something on
  the ground a stumble usually sent them flying several
  feet through the air before they landed ludicrously on
  some part of the anatomy not intended for such usage
  but since their decreased weight sat so lightly upon
  them they did not suffer a great deal from these falls
  moura and urto were careful that the professor did not
  stumble overmuch and when he did they managed to
  keep him on his feet

  they were gone more than two hours disappearing
  almost completely into the darkness when they
  returned they were laden down with specimens they
  had collected samples of rock and ores that proved rich
  in minerals in the small area of no more than two
  miles circumference they had found iron copper tin
  aluminum platinum uranium not to mention commoner
  minerals such as those of sodium calcium magnesium
  and others the next day they went farther and came
  back to report that mercury was in truth a world rich in
  metal a metallic world to be more exact moura pre-
  dicted that in the future men would come to mercury
  for the sole purpose of gathering its wealth

    what proved the most interesting to the expedition
  however were the living speciments they had found
  i have mentioned that on landing we had noted clumps
  of what seemed to be living matter uncle ezra had
  examined this formation and in mouras laboratory a
  more extensive investigation was made the thing looked
  like a mushroom at first with a purple head with soft
  frilled edges that withered at the touch the oddest
  part of it was the underbody which appeared to be a
  root but was instead more like a snake or rather a worm
  and even now after it had been uprooted it wiggled
  slowly and tried to move out of the reach of prying
  fingers i had cried out in horror when i saw that hap-
  pen what is it i asked

    uncle ezra chuckled i am not enough of a natural-
  ist to say for sure elsie but i know i can make a
  guess i think this thing is a zoophyte or in other words
  a plant-animal a compound creature you have read
  darwins voyage of the beagle and you may recall
  his mention of compound animals corrallines creatures
  with worm-like bodies and plant-like heads able to
  move about and produce eggs see here you can make
  out the deposits of eggs under these frills of the head
  and if you look closely you will see some of the eggs
  that have developed into individual polyps still adhering
  to the parent they will do so until full grown its
  a far cry from the argentine swamp to mercurian desert
  and what is most strange about the organism is that it

	lives in a bed of metal ore in which there is neither food
  nor water

    moura bent closer to examine the weird thing that
  wiggled again at his touch poor thing be observed
  how tenaciously it has clung to its little bit of life
  this is possibly all thats left of this dead world but
  now we shall give it a name for so valiantly surviving

      the albedo of a body is the ratio of light which it reflects to that which
   it receives the amount reflected depending to a considerable extent upon
   whether or not the body is surrounded with a cloud-filled atmosphere a
   surface having little or no atmosphere consequently has a low albedo
across the void



the ages allow me to present the rollinsphyte the
last was said in a jocose strain but i saw uncle ezra
enjoyed the thought that he was the discoverer of a life
that was to bear his name

  we left him studying his find and wrent for a swim
we stayed on mercury a week before he could be pre-
vailed upon to leave and all the while his mind was upon
his rollinsphyte i cant figure out he had said how
it subsists on such a meagre fare nor what the poor
thing does at such periods when the sun shines on this
portion of the globe such heat must surely kill it or
if it manages to survive how does it live when the out-
side cold comes in

  why uncle i exclaimed i thought mercury does
not make but a single revolution during the year
of course

  then how-what do you meant

  my child began the professor in that slow drawl-
ing way he had of explaining his science to me surely
you are aware that whatever mercurys period
of rotation is its rate of rotation must es-
sentially be uniform and since it moves in
its orbit so as to fulfill the laws of areas its motion of
revolution is sometimes faster and sometimes slower
than average the result is that the same side is not
always exactly facing the sun thus sometimes it is
 degrees ahead of its mean position in its orbit and
sometimes that much behind so that at such times the
sun shines  degrees beyond where it ordinarily
should shine that is how it happens that in these two
portions of the planet wherein twilight usually lies the
sun actually does shine during the libration period once
yearly therefore this part of the globe receives direct
sunlight just as once again the dark and cold of space
come through

  how then does this little creature survive those two
intense periods see it is withering here in the light
of the room

  i shook my head but ubca-who had become an inter-
ested spectator spoke up perhaps sir that is the
reason for the worm-like appendage which allows the
fellow to migrate each season and so stay within the con-
fines of the twilight

  uncle ezra clapped his hands together in delight
of course how stupid of me not to consider just such
a possibility and now if you will be so good as to
help me we shall see by what process it absorbs its
unusual fare here is a specimen i took from  

  at that juncture i left them not anxious to watch
the ugly little zoophyte any longer

  i was glad when we left mercury behind and headed
for the lovely blue-white world of venus it lay but
 miles away and traveling now at the rate
of five hundred miles per second it took us a little more
than seventeen hours to reach there on the way we
again encountered a shower of meteorites and although
they could do little damage moura at the controls
steered out of their way though occasionally we heard
the impact as the smaller ones struck our sides in fact
as we moved onward our vision almost became obstructed
by the smaller particles that adhered to the ship

  moura explained to me that in moving through space
we created a small attraction for any matter smaller
than ourselves much the same way as the planets at-
tracted us to them and in this case farther away from
the sun they clustered about us since our attraction was
more immediate than was that of sol however as

soon as we came into physical contact with venus she in
turn attracted them from us the missiles dropping upon
her own broad bosom freeing us from the discomfiture
they gave us then we sighted a small crack in the
outer glass on our port side but so sturdy is the glass
of abrui that little damage was done and the small
crack need not be mended until we landed moura be-
lieved the crack due to a flaw in the glass itself but he
was not worried since the crack could go no deeper
than the six inches of its layer and there were thirty-
nine more layers below it even were one layer of
glass peeled away it would make no difference to the
yodverl

power of the mind

now we were slipping into the mists of venus
those grey-white clouds that hide the face of the
world from the peeping toms of the universe
for what seemed hours we slid on a thirty-degree angle
toward the planet moving no faster than two hundred
miles an hour and we all but plunged into the green
tumbling waters of the great ocean of venus over which
the cloud banks swirled before we realized its being
ubca had taken the controls and only his quick action
saved us from a bath in the sea then he brought the
ship to a stationary position no more than fifty feet
above the water and stare as we did our eyes could not
pierce the mist to tell what lay beyond they rose from
the water in long feathery tentacles and made the scene
one of an eery ghostlike beauty above us we could
see the gleam of the sun among the clouds painting them
in a variety of wild colors the clouds acting as a multi-
tude of prisms and diffraction elements on the sunlight
broke it up into the seven hues of our sunsets not thirty
yards away the sun had found a rift through which it
shone down upon the water turning it into a sheet of
gold

   it was here for the first time that i learned something
 of the full power of the abruian mind staring about
 us into that partly illuminated world i grew impatient
 to see land or at least something more tangible than
 clouds sun and water and i wondered at the sudden
 lethargy that had come over the three men in the pilot
 room

   ubca had brought the ship to a standstill and now
 sat quietly in one of the metal chairs half reclining with-
 out saying a word his eyes fastened upon the single beam
 of sunlight as if he had not a care in the world uncle
  ezra paid no heed to anyone his eyes darting here and
 there making his endless observations soon he would
 have something to tell us about the phenomenon of the
 ever present clouds of venus never on the whole
 trip had he questioned anything he saw or had he grown
 impatient when time grew heavy he was a child with
 mouth agape waiting for each new wonder to present
 itself for him to put down in his notebooks him i
 could look to for explanations of natural phenomenon
 but he would never have bothered to inquire into the
 vagaries of the human mind but it was moura-weits
 attitude that struck me as being the strangest of all

   one would have thought this a time for action but
 instead he was standing in the forepart of the room
 hands dropped listlessly at his side eyes turned toward
 the water without seeing it he might have been con-

 sidering everything but the matter at hand yet for
 all his passiveness and that of ubcas too i felt a
 tension in the air i wanted to laugh to scream to wring
 my hands but for what what was the matter with
 both of them was this the way venus treated men
 enfolding them in a state of suspended animation sap-
 ping them of all desire for movement why then
 was i not affected so i even looked about fearfully
 afraid that some ghouls might be approaching to take
 control of the ship then after what had seemed hours
 moura-weit spoke

  land lies to the northward tor and they are
friendly were his queer words ubca looked up from
his staring not at all surprised at the message im-
mediately he was upon his feet working at the levers
and twisting the dials in navigating through a planets
gravitational control the motors repelled the magnetic
vibratory impulses instead of attracting them study-
ing the compass he found it already responded to
venus magnetic poles moura turned and left the pilot
room pausing a moment to say to uncle ezra come
professor i have something of interest to show you

  left alone with ubca i hesitated before speaking
and i had to force my voice from my throat tell me
-what does this mean tor how can he know where
land lies only this morning you said youd never
been to venus before

  ubca looking up from his instruments gave me a
searching look with his lavender eyes then he grinned
broadly you appear to forget miss rollins the
power that lies in the mind of sa dak perhaps you
have forgotten or else never realized that the abruian
mind is all-powerful that the brains of all men are
open to it and sa dak has one of the most powerful
minds ever known on abrui nothing seems beyond
the power of that tremendous brain

  why then with such a mind should we be surprised
that he is able to seek out the minds of those dwelling on
this world learn what there is to know of them con-
verse with them through the medium of the brain i
have seen it happen before-on one of the saturnian
moons only those people were unfriendly and we
did not descend there for we wished no trouble no
doubt sa dak has already advised these buians or
venetians as you would call them that we are coming
and they look for our arrival else if they are not
too civilized they will believe one of their number has
had a vision and think we are god-things

  slowly i nodded my head to what ubca-tor had told
me unable to voice an opinion it was all too hard for
me to believe to understand true i had forgotten
that moura had told us of the mental telepathic powers
of his race but that somehow had left no impression
upon me now timidly i asked is-is my brain open
to mouras mind-and yours too

  ubca nodded all of abrui have that faculty even
the gors but sa dak goes beyond that-he knows
more than you could realize what you will do under
certain circumstances before you yourself are aware
of the trend of your thoughts since his mind moves so
much more quickly than yours-or mine it as though
he had a finger on the pulse

you can imagine my reaction to that discovery i
had now to realize that my brain had been as an
open book to these strange men no privacy of mind

   a dak master in abruian ubca-tor always referred to moura so

whatsoever blushing under ubcas smiling eyes i
excused myself to run in retreat to the little cell-like
room that was my own chamber there to sit thinking of
what i had learned i felt both anger and fright and
wanted never to see any more of the taborans no
woman can be happy in the thought that a man knows
what passes through her mind the very idea of such
a thing tortured me embarrassed me i believed i
could never face any of them again yet strangely
enough i did not resent ubca-tor half so badly as i did
moura-weit

  ubca i had found was a gentle person and although
it appeared to me that he held himself somewhat aloof
from uncle and myself i had recognized the fact that
he was of a self-effacing nature so it was upon his
leader that i vented my spleen considering him at fault
for not reminding me that my every thought was read-
able to him for him to smile at perhaps

  heretofore i had felt that i disliked moura merely
for the man he had been during the two weeks on the
yodverl it is true i found no occasion in which to ex-
ercise my dislike and in that time i had actually for-
gotten the thought that i had disliked him instead
i had been learning to admire him to appreciate his
kindly attitude to us his consideration and his attentive-
ness for first of all moura was a gentleman i had
never before known a man of such force or greatness
of mind and i knew him for a genius he seemed to
me able to conquer anything i remembered now that
during those long hours aboard the spaceflyer i had
even indulged myself in girlish dreams wondering if
it were possible for me insipid person that i was to
inspire admiration in such a man as moura-weit one
can not dwell in close quarters with one they think they
hate and resist such thoughts especially when that one
is a handsome virile man capable of bringing such
thoughts to a woman and what a ninny he must have
found me to be allowing me to live in my fools para-
dise while i was unaware that he knew everyone of my
worthless thoughts how that galled me

  he had been kindly enough through the long days
playing the perfect host looking out for my comforts
explaining this and that but beyond it all there were
no other contacts between us perhaps i had resented
that more than anything else and now i could only
think of the counts i had against him his villaincy to-
ward dana and dick and his world his carrying uncle
ezra off from earth bringing that delicate soul closer
to his death by the strain and excitement this trip was
exercising on him and here he had been making a
fool of me allowing me to believe my intimate thoughts
safely locked in my own bosom

  for the next two hours i kept to my room not ven-
turing forth for fear of meeting the creature of my
hate wondering at the same time if the walls kept my
thoughts safe and knowing they did not but then i
grew sensible and realized that he could have no interest
in me as i dared suppose that a plain colorless female
like myself had little place in his own thoughts and
yet how miserable such a thought made me too can
anyone explain the intricacies of a womans mind i
am certain that not even moura could do that

  imagine then my wonder and chagrin when a knock
came at my door and there stood moura we are com-
ing into the sight of land miss rollins he said kindly
wont you join us 

  i could not answer but walked past him and into the
across the void	

                                                                              

pilot room and he did not speak again but i knew he
had known my thoughts that he had been interested in
what passed through my mind and his coming at that
moment was his way of retribution for the terror he had
caused me he could have dispatched either ubca-tor or
urto instead

chapter v
venus

from the pilot room i saw that a green world lay
below a broad savannah in which a river wended
its way behind was the ocean we had just crossed
moura took control of the ship and as though recog-
nizing a landmark veered the ship so that we followed the
rivers course as it meandered through the lowlands on
either side the grass stretched as far as the eye could see
and i was surprised to notice that the clouds had lifted
and were no closer to the ground than about three thou-
sand feet or so we were flying half way between the
ground and that ceiling

  it was not long however before we caught sight of
a city far ahead lying in a bowl of low hills and moura
left the river that made a wide circle through the
meadows and he headed directly for the city itself
it was a thing of beauty with tall fairy-like spires rising
high into the greyish clouded sky every color of the
rainbow and more but the pastel shades instead of the
clear-cut hues of the spectrum as we drew closer we
could see that wide avenues and squares were set in be-
tween the tremendous buildings and were filled with a
mass of beings but from the height at which we flew
we could not as yet make out their forms clearly

  now we hovered over the tallest building which was
an azure blue tall and slender with the delicate spires
like arms reaching outward arms that seemed a gesture
of a people who were still seeking the truths seeking to
encompass the heavens yet as we drew nearer i saw
that for all its etherealness the building was substantial
and even ponderous expressing great power-a power
that was beautiful because of its strength below were
faces upturned to us and slowly majestically moura
brought his ship about and gently we began to drop
venusward on an even keel

  as we dropped toward the great square before the
azure building it miraculously cleared itself of its
people but i had to wonder at moura in so trustfully
placing his ship and ourselves at their mercy how
completely he must have understood the race in that
silent communion of his he did not hesitate a moment
during the descent even though we were all struck by
the viciousness of the creatures below as we dropped to
their level and what creatures they were

  twenty feet tall they stood with great ungainly bodies
-night-marish manifestations so in variance with the
beauty of their thoughts and their city first our
ship came to the level of their faces we had to call
those hideous livid white expanses with the long ele-
phantine noses and square staring lidless eyes a face
but never had earthly eyes seen such monsters the
eyes set in the faces four feet long and three across
were as large as saucers and each nose almost a yard
and a half in length had what appeared to be a row
of small fingers at the tip there was no visible mouth
and the ears were enormous things of flapping flesh
then came the neck two feet in length flexible and

boneless upholding the broad long head and ending in
shoulders but three feet wide the rest of the body was
pear shaped a bulbous thing of gray-green flesh from
the inedquate shoulders dangled two small weak arms
flexible like the trunk and having a row of small deli-
cate tapering fingers at their ends the body was up-
right until it reached the hips where the pearshape
doubled its girth and there were two pair of heavy round
legs the forelegs several feet longer than the hind ones
the latter being so bent at the knees it made one wonder
how they walked the feet themselves were circular
pads that hit the ground with a resounding smack

  i think that even moura with all his composure was
shocked by the sight of these horrors but he showed no
outward sign as he brought his ship to the ground still
his eyes did glitter strangely and his lips were drawn
tightly around his teeeth of us all i think uncle ezra
was the calmest in these beasts he merely saw a new
type of biological expression and all the while he kept
exclaiming at the awfulness of them trying to class
them to earthly standards nothing could be too strange
for him anymore ubca-tor was downright frightened
and i felt a kinship to him for it only moura and
urto were able to hide most of their emotions

ubca was the first to speak but his words were un-
intelligible to me for he spoke in abruian remem-
bering only his mother tongue in his fear moura al-
ways thoughtful answered him in english so i could
understand

  there is nothing to fear tor he told ubca true
they are atrocities in our eyes but in communicating
with them i met a great mind that readily comprehended
what we were and why we were here and he knew
immediately how to adjust his mind so that we could
communicate he was of a benign personality and i
could find nothing of violence or treachery in his make-
up he told me he was expressing the attitude of his
whole race when he invited us to visit this city and
guided us the whole way you must not judge these
creatures by their outward aspect nature does not con-
sider appearance when she creates    see    they
are clearing the way for the entrance of a personage
come-we must go to meet-our friend

  at mouras words we looked out into the square and
saw that the multitude of legs which were alone in
our direct line of vision were moving aside and clearing
a broad path down which another of their kind was
approaching he was perhaps more gigantic more
hideous than his fellows we followed moura into the
anteroom of our ship and he went over to touch the
lever that would open the heavy door when ubca laid
a hand on his arm

  you have not yet tested the air sa dak how know
you that it is livable

  never impatient moura smiled broadly i know
already what the atmospheres constituents are tor our
friend out there informed me hours ago

  ubca shrugged his shoulders sadly as if he believed
moura had surely lost his mind but when we felt the
rush of warm fresh vapor-filled air that came with the
opening of the doorway we knew that our friend had
not erred and how good the sweet air laden with
moisture was to us there was perhaps in a slight de-
gree more oxygen in the venerian atmosphere but not
enough to distress us instead it gave an added feeling
of well-being to our bodies


amazing stories

  moura stood hesitating a moment in the doorway be-
 fore going to meet the monstrosity that had now come
to a halt fifty feet from the yodverl turning to us
moura suggested that after all we remain on the ship
while he went alone gladly i acquiesced for i had no
wish for closer proximity to those creatures yet i
could not help but fear for moura ubca had expected
to accompany him but so accustomed was he to taking
the others orders that without question he stayed be-
hind he surprised me by flinging me a look that i did
not define immediately but from then on we were joined
in a fellowship

  we had a common fear between us for our leader

  later as new events shaped themselves that brother-
hood of ours became a strong bond

  almost sadly we watched the meeting of the two-the
handsome silver man of abrui and the monster of
venus they came to a halt about ten feet apart and
to my wonder nothing happened but after they had
stood in that manner for fifteen minutes or so i realized
they were conversing through the medium of the brain
then came a movement from the beast as he lifted his
long nose or trunk and emitted a wholly unhuman shriek
which continued a minute or so rising and falling in
volume so that we were led to believe it was a form
of speech when the cry ended the creature with moura
at his heels turned and headed for the azure building on
the right side of the square

  the two disappeared into the building while we feared
and wondered

  thereupon the great square was slowly deserted by
the venerians and soon not a single living soul could
be seen about we could only continue to stare at the
place wherein moura had disappeared ubca called my
attention to the sky above and we were treated to a
scene so beautifully weird that there was pain in it the
sun was dropping low beyond the cloud bands and
obliquely its rays fell upon the masses of vapor throw-
ing one color after another in awful affray before us
flashing back and forth through the moving mists until
our minds were stunned by the vivid changes then
slowly it all faded and the night fell and utter blackness
engulfed us

  now the light of the yodverls glass walls fell upon
us dispensing the store of the suns energy that had been
gathered during the period we had stayed out in space
and shone on us gently without the glare that an in-
candescent light gives forth urto came to tell us that
we had time for a dip in the pool before our evening
meal was ready upset because moura had left him be-
hind ubca appeared distracted but force of habit made
him get into his swimming togs and join me in the pool
while uncle ezra preferred to linger in the open to stare
at the darkness round about

  we swam in the water without spirit ubca was fear-
ful for his beloved friend i was fearful of what might
happen if the venerians should in turn become hostile
yet i too felt a strange loss that was occasioned by
mouras absence it was as if his departure had taken
the color out of our beings and we waited only for
his return to regain the vitality his going had drained
from us i did not realize then how strongly his per-
sonality had already reacted upon me how miserable
i was to become when he was not about even for a short
space of time

  but i must go on with my story

chapter vi
a lesson in mind telepathy

after eating our supper uncle ezra again left
ubca and me to ourselves all this time i had

-	been trying to recall all i had learned of the
abruians and now timidly i put my question to ubca-
tor what is this power of your people that they read
the mind so easily tor

  ubca answered gravely enough as though he did not
know already what lay behind my question it is a
difficult thing to explain miss rollins but first must you
comprehend that everything be it chemical mineral
organic or inorganic is built up basically from vibration
everything is a matter of vibration without it we
could not have the atom the molecule or the star the
smallest bit of matter or the largest all pulse with this
being and if it was not for this natural phenomenon
we could not ourselves live our sensations are a matter
of vibration we see hear and we feel-all because of
this

  a good example of it is given by your machines that
broadcast sound through space the sound is distribu-
ted upon wave lengths of different frequencies so that
you might hear them yet though the waves are there
ordinarily your ears can not hear them can not pick
them up for you without the medium of a certain me-
chanical receiver the same is true of television it is
the same thing you can not see the objects broadcast
unless the machine to gather them and translate them for
you is there

  now we might say that the brain resembles radio
transcription to some degree first the vibratory im-
pulses must be broadcast from some central station be-
fore your receiver can pick them up and in the same
way the objects around you must broadcast themselves
in the varying degrees of wave-lengths before you can
either see hear feel or smell their odors your brain is
therefore likened to your radio receiver but for you to
catch the impressions made on the brain of another is as
impossible as for you to try to listen to radio without
a machine

  you of earth know that the various members of
the body broadcast their wants and hurts to the brain
even now our scientists of abrui seek to discover the
wave-length used by these organs when that is dis-
covered medical science will take a great stride forward
we do know however that as with all animate or in-
animate articles the brain is one for first the brain is
composed of chemicals the same chemicals that compose
the divers solids around about us the difference
however lies in the fact that the brain is a more highly
sensitized plate we might compare it to the difference
between a molecule of water and the great ball of a
star the water contains only three parts of two dif-
ferent elements a star contains all the elements nature
has devised-hundreds and thousands of different com-
binations to be had held together in that one great mass
and so it is with the brain it is composed of many
thousands of cells each cell apart from the other doing
its individual work but on the whole contributing its
powers to the common center

  and the main duty of your brain is to translate to
your consciousness the needs of the entire body just
as your radio instrument translates to you the waves
across the void



that come from out of the ether you believe that you
pick up your brain impulses the moment they are
formed by that wonderful mechanism of your body
that you receive them as quickly as they are made but
this is not true let us suppose that you are fdled with
an emotion it sweeps through the body it causes the
heart to contract the blood rushes to the head the hands
grow cold they perspire can you translate this emo-
tion immediately can you place it understand it no
first you must consider it you must ask your brain what
it means then the brain tells you  it is love it is hate
it is fear this then is one of the first functions of
the brain-to translate into words for you the impres-
sions received whether it is hunger thirst weariness
disgust or sorrow the very beauty of your emotions
the color of your hates the longing of your desires are
all unintelligible incomprehensible to you until the brain
gathers these impressions mixes them for you and trans-
lates them just as your ratlio set gathers mixes and
translates sounds for you you understand me

   i nodded i think so

  good and now perhaps you can understand just
what the abruian mind does for it also is a receiver to
gather from your brain your impressions and just as
you yourself translate these things for yourself so does
the abruian accept the abstract and translate it for him-
self this is telepathy it is evident to us that our re-
mote ancestors learned this method of communicating
with each other before they had speech and their de-
scendants are born with the faculty of gathering each
others brain impulses

   it does not matter to me what language you speak
for on receiving your thoughts i receive them in the ab-
stract and my own brain unconsciously does the work
of translating them into understandable words for me
however in the matter of grasping these brain impulses
of yours my brain has first to be attuned to the same
wave-length that yours makes use of each brain uses
a different wave-length varying as much as the finger
prints of the race vary and only for one aware of this
science it takes but a moments hesitation to feel out
and adjust his brain to anothers once the frequency
on which a particular brain broadcasts is known the
other can hear what passes through that brain

   for several moments i sat in thought before speaking
it sounds highly technical but still i do not grasp how
you are able to hear as you say what passes through
my mind especially since the impulses are of so low a
frequency

   that is a matter i hardly try to understand myself
although i employ it all the time moura-weit could tell
you better than i but as i have said it is a science in-
herited by us from our thousands of generations and is
in a sense as familiar to us as our other five senses

   i see-but i wonder if it were possible for one not
born of your planet to learn the system

  perhaps sa dak could teach you miss rollins i
am not a very capable teacher the construction of
your brain differs from ours and though i can gather
your thoughts i do not know that i could teach you to
read mine

  do you think him incapable of nothing whatsoever
ubca-tor i demanded

  the tor grinned affably when i find something he
can not accomplish i will say yes but until then   

i concede moura-weit master of everything he does

end of

i had no answer for that and since i did not wish
to dwell upon moura-weits powers i brought the
conversation back to what was uppermost in my mind
isnt it possible for one to keep another from reading
his thoughts

  oh yes he said that is as everyday a thing as
reading the others mind for it would be insufferable to
have your mind always open to others yet again sa
dak is the one man against whom it is difficult to close
the brain i no longer attempt it and my mind is al-
ways accessible to him

  but could you not teach me how to do it

  i can try to help you if you wish it

  do so right away i cried

  he shook his head it can not be learned in an hour
or a day miss rollins but perhaps if you train yourself
constantly in time you may learn the secret

  that was discouraging but with youths intrepidity i
thought i might accomplish the trick in short order and
i needed it right away what must i do  i asked

  first you must learn the power of utter concentra-
tion you must make your mind so pliant and flexible
that you may carry a thought with you hour after hour
day after day so that no matter what else occupies your
mind you can not lose it i understand that few earth-
lings know what true concentration means

  how is it done

  well let us take-this flower and ubca stooped
and plucked a delicate bloom that was growing in the
pots around the pool you will note the shape of the
flower the shape of its white heart its violet-black
petals you see the veins in the petals the contour of
its sheaf the size and design of each individual part
you breathe in its perfume you know its odor but can
you carry the thought of it around with you throughout
your day will its color tint the rest of our thoughts
will its delicate perfume stay with you abovethe odor
of all other things your sense encounters can you
carry the thought of it in your dreams and recall it
vividly even weeks later after this blossom is dead and
gone can you remember its every detail so accurately
that you can draw it upon paper months later and not
miss a slightest vein if you can do that miss rollins
then you can make your brain pliant and flexible enough
so that you are prepared for the next lesson to come
taking the little flower from his fingers i looked at it
twirled it about and stared at it in wonder seeing the
difficulty of the task i said nothing more about it but
when i again had leisure i commenced to learn this new
science yet it took many months and many flowers to
accomplish that first step

  now as i sat considering all this an interruption
came in the form of urto who rushed into the room in
a stateof fright tee poofossee he was crying tee
proofossee

  we were both on our feet immediately i ran from
the room without stopping to learn the trouble but
ubca-tor was wise enough to question the golden man as
to what was wrong i had run directly to the laboratory
but not finding him there was on my way to the pilot
room when ubca caught up with me your uncle has
gone outside and urto can not find him in the darkness
come we had better search urto will wait here if he
returns and give us a signal he stopped in the ante-
room to pick up a torchlight and then we ran out into
the night calling uncles name

          by john c dare

      telow the surface of this short story lies a good lesson more
      l-j than ever now in these days of financial depression and trusts
      and monopolies we are likely to lend a very willing ear to authori-
      ties in the various fields of science unfortunately to make as sweep-
      ing an improvement as is made in cosmic power  the scientist must
      be imbued with an almost unnaturally strong incentive and our
      hero is and perhaps some enterprising young person with thus far
      unexplored inventive potentialities will derive some beneficial ideas
      from this tale it is not impossible

                    illustrated by morey

entlemen we are sunk-scuttled-on
the rocks read that

  the above concise and very slangy state-
ment was made in a bitter tone as john
cherron finished reading the message he
had just received and passed it to the man on his right

  the four men present formed the board of directors
of the international food products inc

  high in the tower on the roof of the food products
building the directors sat smoking gloomily as the
message passed from hand to hand each face grew more
gloomy still

  the year was two thousand to get the situation well
in mind it is necessary to explain the advancement made
in electrical developments gasoline-driven cars and
planes were practically obsolete here and there an
occasional one might be found driven by gas since the
perfection of wireless transmission of electrical energy
most of them had gone to the scrap heap

  all food was made synthetically planes and giant air
liners were electrically driven factories and all forms
of ground transportation-in fact everything necessary
to human existence-had come to depend on electricity
to such an extent that the huge sign on top of the
power trust building had begun to assume a sinister
significance

  the sign read power is life

  the sinister meaning of the sign had just been called
to the attention of the members of the food board

     the message read in effect

    we have been empowered by the international
  power commission to raise all power rates twenty-
  five per cent you are hereby notified that on and
  after the thirty-first instant the new power
  schedule will be in effect

p g wilson pres

               per c e canto sec power trust
as far back as the year nineteen hundred the public
had from time to time received warning against what
at the time had been termed giant power even then
this forerunner of the power trust had been quietly
gaining control of the sources of electrical energy all
the water power sites in the western part of the united
states were rumored to be under their control even at
that early date as new sources of energy were dis-
covered they were acquired sometimes by purchase
sometimes by means that were questionable their
slogan had been results and results they had accumu-
lated until now at the end of the twentieth century
they not only controlled all sources of electrical energy
but through that power controlled almost everything
else they dictated the policies of the different govern-
ments told the preachers what to preach the schools
what to teach to such a degree that the civilized world
was fast becoming a subsidiary of power and power
meant p g wilson

because of the prevalence of carbon monoxide gas
poisoning gasoline-driven vehicles had been banned from

if sail

the streets of all cities in the early part of nineteen
forty-five for the next twenty years all urban
traffic had been taken care of by the old-fashioned
electric cars many of the cities which had abolished
them during the heyday of the gasoline-driven
cars were forced to reinstall the electric cars

  in the year nineteen hundred and sixty-five a
man by the name of cardin discovered a way of
transmitting electrical energy without the aid of
wires

  the power trust quickly acquired the patents
and improved the method to such an extent that in a
very short time all wire transmission had been done
away with the energy was transmitted on five
bands as they were called corresponding to five dif-
ferent voltages all power used was to be paid for
in advance at a fixed rate the fifth band furnished
power to all large motors factories street rail-
ways drainage systems all took their power from
the fifth band all air traffic used the fourth the
phone and television system used the third

vented a system of transmitting energy or selective

waves in the different bands and a controlling system
whereby each particular motor used its own selected ray
the amount used could be metered and the power turned
off if not paid for in the case of planes and motor cars
each vehicle could be kept track of at all times by an
indicator in the selective control room the indicator
was in the form of a tiny red dot moving over the face
of a small map the indicator was automatic when
the vehicle started the dot traced its course on the map

  gentlemen cherron repeated that finishes us
doing business as we are on a bare ten per cent margin
an increase of twenty-five per cent in power rates-well
it doesnt take an expert to figure that out

  lets take the matter up with the commission said
strom one of the board members we can show a bare
ten per cent profit well take it up to the supreme
tribunal if necessary

  cherron laughed bitterly

  leaning forward he said impressively strom dont
act like a child wheres your brain man what hap-
pened to turbo motors inc and steel products ltd
my god can you men see it that devil wilson
owns the courts owns the commission and means to
own the whole damned earth

  its all clear at last he continued ever since his
ancestor gained control of giant power the wilson
family have been working toward that end

  cherron was on his feet now pacing back and forth
the tides have been harnessed all coal and oil de-
posits every single source of power is owned or con-
trolled by wilson and to what end i tell you gentle-
men there can be but one object-and that is the dic-
tatorship of the planet

bu-r-r-r-r

answer the phone please strom said cherron
someone wants to talk to you jack said strom
who is it asked cherron oh tell him we are in
conference and cant be bothered he added

  strom snapped on the television and motioned for
jack to look

  ever see him before he whispered

  the television showed a rather shabbily dressed old
gentleman with long grey whiskers and a diffident
manner short stocky and broad-shouldered he waited
patiently for cherron to answer the phone as he slowly
puffed a cigar the old gentleman suddenly turned on
his own television he saw cherron and spoke before
jack could dodge out of view

  mr cherron he said in a deep voice i have some-
thing very important to discuss with you and the food
co board if you can spare me a few moments i think
i can interest you enough so youll hear me out you
gentlemen are no doubt discussing the raise in power
rates as everyone else is doing oh yes at jacks in-
quiring look the raise hit everyone and the city is
humming like a bee-hive

  shall we let him come up cherron asked the other
three he wants to talk to the board he added

  might as well spoke up one of the members silent
until now adding bitterly there wont be any board
after the first of the month

  the old gentleman presented himself at the door in
a few moments following cherrons invitation he
waved aside the invitation to be seated and said smiling
if i cant interest you in three minutes ill bid you
good day so there is no use in my sitting down

  he took a few thoughtful puffs at his cigar as if in
doubt how to begin he seemed to come to a decision
took the cigar from his mouth and with twinkling eyes
said how would you gentlemen like to be the means of
knocking the power trust higher than a cocked hat
the four men leaned forward simultaneously waving
him to a chair

  professor vondig as he introduced himself laughed
softly as he accepted the chair remarking i thought
that would get you

  the board members had been interested for a mo-
ment but as the impossibility of the thing seemed to
strike them they again assumed their gloomy mien

  professor cherron addressed him do you realize
what an utterly impossible thing you suggest we
promised to hear you out so go ahead if there is the
slightest merit in your scheme we are with you heart
and soul and to the limit of our collective purse right
boys the other three nodded agreement

before going further professor vondig addressed
them what is the source of the power trusts invinci-
bility  is it not the fact that they control all the sources
of power as their big sign says-power is life
the four nodded agreement

then he continued if some source of power were
discovered with millions of volts and an amperage al-
most beyond calculation something that could not be
controlled by the trust what would you gentlemen say 
as one man they chorused power trust-finish
exactly said the professor adding calmly as he
emitted a huge puff i have discovered that power
im not a fanatic he continued his eyes twinkling
at their intent looks if you gentlemen will accompany
me on a little trip i can demonstrate the truth of my
statement incredible as it may seem it will take about
six hours by my plane to get to our destination mine
is not as speedy a plane as some of the newer ones but
it will be safe

  why not take mine  cherron asked it is big and
speedy

  electric asked the professor

  cherron admitted that it was

  it wont do then the professor announced you
get your power from the power company they know
just where you are at all times and i cant take the
chance of being traced

  your name sounds familiar professor said cher-
ron as the five men made their way to the field where
the professor kept his plane wasnt it a professor
vondig who invented the present system of selective
power broadcasting 

  my father answered the professor with a grim
look perhaps you can better understand my animus
against the trust now he died a pauper they stole
his invention and beat him in every court in the land

  you may be wondering why i selected you four men
out of all the millions on the earth to assist me in smash-
ing the power trust i have looked up the records of
the food company mr cherron i learned that you
boys have been giving away almost as much food as you
have been selling that is very poor business mr
cherron he chided then in a different tone but darn
good humanity a better recommendation than that
no one could ask for you fellows have been feeding
a lot of people who were pauperized by power thats
one reason that wilson is after your scalps
cosmic power



  here is my plane announced the professor as they
arrived at the field

  she is just an old-time turbo gas motor but still
good for three hundred miles an hour my place is on
the peninsula in lower california i had to get out
of the traffic lanes and use this old type plane to avoid
publicity

it was difficult to make ones voice heard above the
noise of the humming propellers the public air-
port where the professor had parked his plane was a
very busy place at this time of day it was four oclock
quitting time for many of the busy millions who were
hurrying to get home very few people lived in the city
nowadays planes rose from the field by the thousand
straight up they rose to the two-thousand foot level
required by law for local traffic at that level hung
a huge platform-the traffic police station as the
planes reached that level they stopped hanging sus-
pended on their gyroprops until they got the signal
from the traffic station then darted away toward their
destination on the platform were a dozen speedy little
one-man fliers propellers turning over lazily in each
cockpit a speed officer sat at the controls ready to take
the air occasionally one of the small planes would
leave the platform and like a darting dragon-fly over-
take some traffic violator to whom he would hand a
ticket or whom he would proceed to ball out in the
fashion approved by his kind the world over

  from the roofs of the city arose another swarm of
planes to hang stationary a moment then shoot away on
the various levels according to the directions of the busy
sky police

  high above on the five-thousand foot level coursed
huge liners and long distance planes while still higher
at ten thousand could be seen a lone trans-pacific
freighter as it hung poised a moment before starting
on its long journey to china and japan

  all paying tribute to wilson said the professor
with a comprehensive sweep of his arm toward the
swarming planes as they climbed into his flier

  the professor displayed his long distance signal and
they swiftly rose to the level of the platform where
they paused a moment presently a grinning police-
man who had recognized the professor motioned them
to go on up to the level called for by the signal on the
plane and in a few minutes they were eating up the
miles southward

  six hours later they descended by the light of the
moon up on a shelving beach on the gulf of california

  there is my home and shop announced the pro-
fessor indicating a large concrete building looming in
the moonlight further back from the beach

  the building appeared to be about a hundred feet
square single story and as they approached it a slender
flagpole could be dimly seen emerging from the roof and
disappearing in the hazy moonlight skyward

  the four visitors looked around with lively interest
as professor vondig ushered them inside and turned on
the lights

  an enormous insulated cable entered through the
center of the roof curving over to the largest switch

  gyroprops was the name given to the helicopters one embedded in each
upper wing surface their relative speed was controlled by a gyroscope in
such a way that a sudden gust of wind would not tip the plane over when
it was hanging stationary supported by the gyroprops any variation
from the level was automatically compensated for by the rise in speed of
the helicopter on the lower wing

board any of them had ever seen in the center of the
board was a massive knife-blade switch with copper
blades ten feet long and four inches thick it appeared
to be the master switch as coils of wire ran from it to
smaller switches although the smallest ones were giants
compared to any the visitors had seen before in the
center of the room was a large drum like the ones used
in laying trans-oceanic cables a gear and pinion was
mounted on one end of the drum further out on the
pinion shaft appeared a pulley from which a belt ran
to a gas engine secured to the floor with heavy bolts
everything about the place was made on a vast scale
as cherron stated it looked like a giants playhouse

  the northeast corner of the building for twenty
feet both ways from the walls was taken up with another
machine built -on the same gigantic lines into which coil-
ing wires entered from the switch board the professor
explained that it was a new type of power broadcasting
machine of his own design

  the east wall was literally covered with rheostats
voltmeters ammeters and safety catches

  a small room had been built on the southeast corner
of the plant into which the professor led the way
saying these are my living quarters gentlemen be
seated while i explain to you the source of my power

  this laying a piece of rock on the center of the
table around which they were seated is a piece of
quartz which has very peculiar qualities when sub-
jected to an electric current this rock becomes what we
call gravitation-negative that is it loses its attraction
for the earth and tries to fly out into space

  noticing the doubtful glances between the four guests
he connected two wires which he evidently had ready
for that purpose-one to each end of the stone he
then turned a switch nothing happened calmly
puffing on his cigar he next began regulating a small
rheostat as the current increased the stone began
to quiver and presently to their amazement rose from
the table and floated free only held down by the trailing
wires

  with a little smile of triumph professor vondig
turned off the current as the stone thumped back on
the table he seated himself and continued his explana-
tion

  on this rock hinges my whole discovery for years
we scientists have conjectured that all space outside our
atmosphere envelope is a seething pool of electric
energy electrons are thrown off from the sun in
enormous quantities they can penetrate our atmos-
phere only for a short distance however i figured
that if a conducter could be carried out into space and
held there then this infinite pool of energy could be
diverted to our uses i tried carrying a wire upward
by means of a balloon with indifferent results the
balloon would not go high enough while looking over
some old books in the public library i came across an
account of experiments carried out by a man whose
name is now forgotten he succeeded in producing
negative gravitation in a piece of quartz by means of an
electric current the kind of quartz was not mentioned
on the book but it gave me the idea for four years
i hunted quartz and experimented at last i found it
gentlemen by grinding this rock and mixing certain
chemicals with it i can by applying the proper voltage
gave it a lifting power of one ton think of it a piece
of quartz eight by ten inches lifting a ton


amazing stories

  that discovery alone is worth untold wealth with a
properly constructed car and this lifting power inter-
stellar space could be navigated if i should make this
discovery public however it would go the road of
fathers invention wilson would get it

  the only way out for all of us is to break wilson
and by the living god gentlemen that is what i am
going to do

 for an instant there was a trace of excitement in the
professors voice then his eyes twinkled again as he
lit another cigar and continued

  what you no doubt mistook for a flag-pole is a
copper cable carried out into space and held there
by a ten foot cube of this quartz the current coming
in over it is terrific-way beyond measuring with any
instrument that i have been able to construct all the
power from the power trusts thousands of plants cant
equal the output of this one cable gentlemen i have
tapped the reservoirs of space no machine designed
by man has ever been able to approximate the voltage
in a lightning flash this power of mine is the power
of all the lightning so much power that i dare not at-
tempt to use more than a small fraction of the potential
output

  with that broadcasting machine in the corner of the
plant and this power at my disposal i can burn out any
generator of the power trust within thirty seconds it
is my intention however to install two more cables and
enough broadcasting machines to take care of he load
as i destroy the plants and that is why i need financial
assistance

  how long is that cable professor asked cherron
and what keeps it from breaking of its own weight

  the cable is nearly five hundred miles long an-
swered the professor replying to your other ques-
tion the first cable i tried to erect did break i over-
came that difficulty in this way the quartz compound
can be melted by intense heat it was necessary to erect
a large vat at the factory where the cable was manufac-
tured the vat was filled with the melted quartz then
the cable was passed through it as the cable emerged
from the vat a thin coating of the compound clung to
it and cooling formed a layer of quartz on the outside
of the cable the compound is even a better conductor
than the copper any current passing through the cable
also flows through the coating of quartz in that way
the cable is self-sustaining in fact it couldnt fall even
though the cube of quartz were to be broken loose by a
meteorite

  the cable consists of a copper core six inches in
diameter then the layer of quartz outside that comes
a four-inch layer of insulation the cable is reinforced
on the outside by layers of steel wire there is a small
wire imbedded in the insulation i had to have a return
circuit to activate the quartz after the first hundred
miles had been paid out the current from space started
to flow and the small wire wasnt needed any longer

  now gentlemen i promise you a demonstration
at eleven oclock tonight i plan to destroy that wave
motor just north of golden gate that is the generators
in the plant it is ten minutes to eleven now

  there wont be much to see said the professor
at least not on this end the other end at that station is
where the fireworks will be that plant is automatic
and there shouldnt be anyone around there to get in-
jured that is why i settled on it to demonstrate with

  it lacks ten minutes yet he continued it will

take a few minutes to warm up the transformers and i
have to plot the direction so if you care to accompany
me he said rising you are welcome to do so

  the four men followed him into the plant

the professor went to the huge switchboard and
closed one of the switches at which the trans-
formers started humming with a deep musical note he
next went to a desk and after figuring for a minute
with dividers and slide rule took his station by the in-
strument board on the eastern wall watch in hand
grim of face slowly puffing on the ever present cigar
he stood like a figure of fate one hand on the control
lever of a rheostat

  the four men stood by the broadcasting machine
silent their eyes on the professors hand resting on
the rheostat

  could it possibly be true their thoughts ran was
the world at last to be freed from the menace of the
power trust could he by a flick of the wrist destroy
that plant so many miles away

  now broke in the professors deep voice as he
pulled the lever down for an instant the humming of
the transformers increased to a high shrill note then
died away to the low steady hum again

  the professor turned to them his face exultant
gentlemen he said if my calculations are not wrong
the golden gate plant is now a wreck

  i have a receiving set here turned in on the world
news he said as he led the way back to his quarters
we should be hearing of it in a few moments

  rioting reported in several eastern cities came the
broadcasters voice as the professor turned on the radio
thought to be the result of property-on the voice
droned-stock reports-stolen planes etc

  then excitedly-golden gate power plant blown up
thought to be caused by short circuit plant utterly de-
stroyed shock felt all over city-click

  the professor shut off the radio turned to the four
men and asked satisfied gentlemen

  the four food company men men accustomed to re-
press their feelings were now as excited as schoolboys
with almost the same movement they drew their check
books and asked how much do you need professor
vondig

  oh man chortled wall the most taciturn mem-
ber to think of making that fat wilson dance to his
own music its worth a million to me he hastily
scribbled a check and tossed it to the professor saying
when thats gone theres plenty more

  -professor vondig waved their checks away with a
contented little laugh and said i dont want your checks
men here is my plan one of you go to dick smith
of copper ltd and order the cable he has the speci-
fications he helped me financially on the first one the
poor devil is almost gone to the wall now or i would
not have to come to you for assistance just another
victim of power dick is

  why dick is a friend of mine cherron stated is
he in on this

  heart and soul answered the professor he has
been from the beginning

  keep things quiet order the cable and go back
to your business ill need several thousand dollars to
put up another building and install some more ma-
chinery if you gentlemen can arrange it so i can have
the cash it will be better then there will be a crew of
cosmic power



men to pay you fellows arrange that with dick we
dont want any checks passed wilson controls the
banks and he might connect us with his plant disaster

one month later p g wilson sat in his palatial
office fifty feet underground in the basement of
the power building no towers for that gentleman
towers were too easily bombed his father had gone
to his reward in that manner in the tower of this same
building ten years ago

  the system of offices covered two acres all under-
ground corridors patroled by armed guards and all
visitors had to submit to search before they were
allowed to enter mr wilsons august presence

  mr wilsons fat repulsive face was very thoughtful
this morning he had just received the financial state-
ment of the money expended for repairs on the golden
gate plant the amount was staggering

  a new radio turned very low was announcing the
current events at his elbow but mr wilson was not
paying much attention to it

  presently he made up his mind he pressed a button
and the head clerks voice answered jones ordered
wilson prepare a letter to the international power
commission request an additional raise of two per cent
in power rates to cover our loss in thegoldengateplant
mr wilson a guard interrupted theres a boy
here with a personal message for you shall i admit
him

  always admit personal messengers dake wilson
snapped i have to tell you that every day

  yes mr wilson

  here he is sir the guard said as he returned
leading a ragged boy by the arm

  whered you get this wilson snarled at the boy
as he read the letter the boy handed him

  a man give it to me an give me a dollar said the
boy beginning to cry at wilsons glaring look

  what did he look like wilson shot at him

  he-he had a crutch an one eye wuz-

  one eye was what

  it had black cloth on it an clothes all ragged the
boy finally stammered

  let him go dake said wilson to the guard who-
ever gave him this was disguised too late to catch him
now

  wilson turned to the phone and after a short wait
said hello war office listen i just received this
note given by a party unknown to a street urchin to
deliver

    piggy wilson

    you have forty-eight hours in which to lower the
  power rates fifty per cent within one week from
  date you will turn over all power holdings to the
  various governments in whose territory they are
  located at a just valuation

    the golden gate plant was destroyed by us if
  within forty-eight hours your decision is not broad-
  cast by world news we act 

  piggy in an inquiring tone from the phone
yes wilson answered thats what the boys used
to call me at school

  fits like a glove murmured the secretary to him-
self

  whats that wilson snapped

  yes mr wilson well look into the matter at once
ill turn it over to the secret service

  youll do nothing of the kind growled wilson
i want a five plane patrol and a cordon of infantry
for each of my plants

  but mr wilson that is beyond my-

  never mind all that get busy or therell be a new
secretary before night said wilson as he broke the
connection

  no chance of tracing that note mused wilson
written with a pencil no finger marks on it someone
having a joke at my expense ill make em think its a
joke if i locate them

  then turning his thoughts to more pleasant things
lets see checking on his fingers today we take
over food products inc copper ltd united clothing

- running out of fingers he seized a pencil and

began to check on a pad stopping occasionally to rub
his hands unctuously-a trick descended from some
ancient forebear

  presently he ceased figuring and with a pleased smile
said aloud another month and those that want to
work will work for me or starve

  six hours before the forty-eight hour ultimatum to
wilson was to expire a plane landed on the beach in
front of professor vondigs plant on the gulf of lower
california five men got out and made their way to-
ward the plant four of them were former members
of the food company board members no longer wil-
son had taken the company over for a fraction of its
value the fifth man was dick smith of the defunct
copper ltd

  i see the professor has his other cables up re-
marked cherron as they approached the plant three
rigid cables now disappeared stretching upward from
the roof

  i hope wilson thinks were only bluffing and doesnt
give in said smith we should smash him anyway
he continued look at all the misery he has caused
im in favor of no mercy contributed strull that
fat monstrosity has never shown any to anyone

  the professor thought it politic to give him a chance
to be decent said cherron that way well have the
government on our side we wont be blamed for the
casualties that may occur the professor knows the
wilson family too well to issue that ultimatum if he
thought there was any chance of wilsons compliance
with our demands whats worrying him is the pos-
sible loss of life although god knows most of the poor
devils that work for wilson would be better off dead
we pushed the food plant to the utmost this past
month we have food enough stored to last the nations
for a month in a pinch i gave a quiet tip to the
managers of other essential products plants most of
them have been turned over to wilson now he held
mortgages on all of us through his banks however
last months output has been stored at strategic points
with an eye to relieving the situation as much as pos-
sible

  the five had now entered the plant and were met by
the professor with a hearty hand-clasp and a puff of
cigar smoke the professors best friend told dick
smith that the professor always went to bed with a
cigar in his mouth at least no one had ever seen him
without one in the daytime

  all set gentlemen he greeted them ive in-
stalled a news broadcasting set at twelve today when
the ultimatum expires well cut in on the world news
and broadcast a warning


amazing stories

  the announcer for the world news was preparing
to broadcast an additional two per cent raise in power
rates when his words were drowned by a deep powerful
voice

  citizens of the world at exactly one oclock
pacific standard time every power plant generating
on the fifth band will be destroyed everyone is warned
to keep away from all designated plants

  the deep voice ceased and the dumfounded announcer
took up his interrupted duties

  mr wilson waiting in his luxurious office to hear
his power raise announced bit his cigar in two what
the hell this joke has gone too far he grated and
seizing his phone called the war office

  did you hear that  he yelled when he got his con-
nection this thing has got to stop did you put
on those guards

  he was assured that all precautions had been taken
and sank back in his chair with a relieved sigh never-
theless he kept one eye on the clock

  closer and closer crept the hand-five minutes to one-
three minutes would the damn thing ever reach
twelve-one minute-slowly the seconds dragged-
one oclock bo-o-om a deep reverberating roar that
shook the city to its foundations

  br-r-r-r-r

m wilson now a quivering mass of fat an-
swered the phone a servile voice with an un-
dertone of exultation in it said head clerk speaking
sir

  well what is it

  mr wilson theyve done it the reports are coming
in fast every plant on the five band is a wreck some
of the buildings are not damaged much but every gen-
erator is a smoking mass of fused metal worse than

that at the golden gate and- the voice rattled on

but mr wilson didnt hear it

  he was holding his head in his hands and groaning
millions-billions

  the deep voice that had announced the catastrophe
just over suddenly spoke in wilsons ear

  citizens of the world the power trust has felt
our might sufficient power will be furnished to users
on the five band on condition that not one penny shall
be paid to the power company anyone violating this
rule will be cut off this is only the beginning you
will be warned as the destruction continues if anyone
was injured in the plants today we are sincerely sorry
the current furnished is free the destruction will con-
tinue until the power trust is crushed

  wilson recovered slowly from the stunned silence in
which he had listened to the voice on the radio

  billions of dollars in damage all my five band
plants destroyed

  he listened apathetically to the reports coming in and
gazed half-seeingly at the television as scene after
scene flashed by each verbal report being accompanied
by its attendant view of destruction

  what had happened to his dream of power

  for years every device of the gigantic organization
had been working to the one end of world dictatorship
for the wilson family

  what was this new power  all the collective wattage
of his thousands of power plants could not equal the
tremendous energy displayed in this wholesale destruc-
tion and his enemies were furnishing free power

  ha some new source of energy that costs nothing to
operate

  suddenly he seized the phone the light of battle on his

face

  war department he asked when he got his con-
nection

  wilson speaking did you get a direction on that
broadcast 

  yes mr wilson came the voice of the secretary in
sugary tones but the secretarys face had an altogether
different expression

  the power wave that wrecked your plants and the
voice on the radio came from a point just fifty miles
north of the extreme tip of the peninsula of lower
california on the gulf side

  carney said wilson calling the secretary by name
you will immediately mobilize a fleet of planes and
proceed to capture that plant

  mr piggy wilson came the reply the voice sugary
no longer with the compliments of the president and
myself you and the power company can go straight to
hell

  w-whats that stammered wilson

  you are through-finished said carney distinctly
and my advice to you is to go to your nearest plant and
use yourself to short circuit one of your own generators
now thank god we can feel like men again he added
as he broke off

it was hard to realize four days ago practically the
supreme dictator of the planet today told to go
to hell by the man who would then have licked his boots

  he wasnt beaten yet there was one bunch of men
he could depend on five hundred fliers fighters to
the last ditch they would have to fight wilsons
men his wolves criminals all who would have paid
the supreme penalty long ago if he had not protected
them his interests were their interests if he went
under they would receive short shrift from the public

  wilson gave orders by phone to have the planes and
fliers ready and half an hour later arrived at the air-
port himself

  it was an imposing array that spread before him as
he spiraled down in his little flier five hundred planes
gyroprops turning lazily ready to take the air and sow
destruction on the instigators of his own misfortunes
giant bombers were there one bomb from one of them
on the plant of his unknown enemy and it would be the
finish he would try strategy first he must know
the secret of their power if possible if not well his
plants could be rebuilt and things would go on as before
only he thought grimly there would be some new
government officers hed show them how to be insolent
to the wilson

  wilson landed and took his place in a giant bomber
in the center of the formation whatever his faults
he was no coward and he meant to be there at the finish
if he had stayed in his office another ten minutes he
would have heard a very interesting announcement

  at his signal the low drone of the whirling props rose
to an angry crescendo and the huge mass of planes rose
as one perhaps twenty feet they rose when every
gyroprop went dead as a sullen boom echoed over the
city and they crashed back to earth lucky they were
no higher there were enough explosives in those
planes to wreck the entire city the excited pilots
climbed out of their cockpits asking each other what
cosmic

power



was the matter the trouble was not hard to locate
all wilsons fourth band generators had been destroyed

  the pilots of great air liners streaking their way over
land and seea all the multitudinous fliers had felt that
sickening drop as the power failed only for an instant
however then the unknown power took up the load and
the many planes went on their way

  all but wilsons his selective rays were cut off his
planes dead his punitive expedition a failure

  six men grimly watched the television screen as the
five hundred armed planes crashed back to earth halted
in their intended flight watched the crew disembark
saw wilson go with drooping head as he passed out of
range of the television screen grouped in the annex
whidh the professor had had erected during the past
month they stood tensely before the screen that covered
one entire wall here all the passing events could be
kept track of and wilsons activities closely watched

  the annex was crowded with queer machinery the
other three walls were covered with switches coils and
gleaming dials a dozen men were scattered about the
room expert electricians testing regulating and chang-
ing adjustments as the plant took over the enormous
load formerly carried by wilsons wrecked power
plants

  one of the men who watched the television spoke

  do you think that wilson will quit now professor
he asked

  rather difficult to say replied the professor ac-
cording to world news all his men have deserted him
except the five hundred fliers rioting has broken out
among the deserters and all the police reserves are out
trying to protect the power companys property

  i dont want to destroy the other three bands if it
can be avoided the extra cables will take care of the
load but there are bound to be a lot of casualties on
those bands as all the power plants are in thickly popu-
lated districts

  wilsons last resort will be gasoline-driven planes
he is not the type of man you would call a quitter but
i dont know where he could pick up five hundred gaso-
line planes on short notice

  there are a thousand of them stored in those old
turbo motors plants said dick smith wilson
smashed turbo for bucking him and took over the
whole works on a mortgage there are bombers scouts
and observation two-seaters in the bunch turbo was
filling a government contract when he went broke

  in that case we can look for trouble just as soon as
they can transfer the weapons said the professor
theres no television transmitting apparatus at that
old abandoned plant so well have to mount guard and
watch for them well im ready for them he added

  just what are our defenses professor asked cher-
ron theyll have machine guns demolition bombs
heat rays and some of those bombers can mount one
pounders

  i saw you looking at that network that covers the
outside of the buildings cherron that is the only de-
fense well need i think in case it fails i have another
that wont fail the explanation of it all is rather tech-
nical so we wont go into that now im rather busy at
present the professor added as he went over to the
switchboard to instruct one of the men

  here they come came the cry from the watcher on
the roof at daybreak the following morning it was
a magnificent sight five hundred planes in the form

of a giant wedge sweeping down on them a great
bomber was at the apex of the wedge with a white flag
on its left wing

  humming like a swarm of mammoth bees they swept
forward and encircled the plant at an altitude of three
thousand feet they formed a great circle a half mile in
diameter where they hung stationary on their gyroprops
the plant below them in the center of the circle

the plane bearing the white flag dropped swiftly
toward the beach and landed gently a short distance
from the door of the plant as the bomber landed p g
wilson stepped out and came quickly toward the build-
ing with his face set and grim professor vondig met
him at the door

  are you the man responsible for these outrages
snarled wilson as the twomen met

  professor vondig bowed and in his deep voice re-
plied 

  i have that honor mr wilson vondig is the name
you no doubt remember my father whom you robbed
of his patents

  i remember him rasped wilson ill give you
and your friends ten minutes to surrender this plant
or- waving his hand upward-ill turn my wolves
loose and you will go to join him turn over your dis-
coveries as compensation for damages done to my
property and you and your friends may go free ha
cherron and the food board catching sight of the men
who were grouped in the doorway and dick smith too
so you down-and-outers are in on this  wilson laughed
nastily professor vondig bowing sarcastically to
the professor you have surely picked a bunch of lame
ducks to assist you and since i see who your associates
are i withdraw my offer to arbitrate as soon as i
reach my men you may consider hostilities open and ill
have the extreme pleasure of blowing the whole bunch
of you to hell

  gentlemen with a nasty smile i bid you good day
and--good-bye wilson clenched his hands and with-
out another word returned to his plane and joined the
cordon of planes over the plant

  professor vondig entered the plant went to the
switch board and closed the circuit to the netting sur-
rounding the building then climbed the stairs to a
tower on the roof he declined the assistance of his
five friends saying it wont be necessary boys i can
handle them alone

  by the lord harry cherron ejaculated he never
missed a puff on that cigar the professor must be-
lieve in his defenses he continued but i dont know
with their heat rays and tons of bombs    well were
in for it so lets shake boys and hope for the best

  the five men solemnly shook hands and waited with
tense faces for the battle to start

  they hadnt long to wait suddenly a heat ray from
one of the planes struck the beach slowly it crept to-
ward the plant the sand in its path exploding with a
hissing noise now another ray joined the first then
another and another no answer came from the plant

  those devils in the cockpits above seemed to enjoy
prolonging the end like a cat playing with a mouse

the hissing of the heat rays now merged in a loud
roar the planes above had divided forces one hun-
dred of them now clustered directly over the plant
around the cables while the other four hundred had
continued on page 
the next day the american rolled into the steel
cylinder where the temperature was always under
fifty degrees below zero

charles reade a famous english
novelist advocated strongly the teach-
ing of ambidexterity to all many tools
can be used equally well by either hand
some can write as well with the left hand
as with the right some can write better
with the left hand think what an ad-
vantage a surgeon for instance would
possess if he could use either hand equally
well and suppose also if by some freak
of operative skill the brain could be made
to act differently on each of the two
hands dr keller is very strictly within
his own field here and he has given us a
bit of scientific fiction of unusual interest
the

ambidexter

            by david h keller md

author of the revolt of the pedestrians stenographers hands etc

                       illustrated by morey

the greatest surgeon in america looked
at the greatest surgeon in asia the
oriental in return looked at the white man
with genuine admiration

from my student days i have held the
greatest reverence for you dr hopkins reverence for
you has been a part of my daily life also envy for
your skill and despair of ever reaching the heights of
perfection you have attained

  that was nicely said wing loo replied the man
from chicago but after all there is only one thing
and that an accident which prevents you from being my
equal or superior at the operating table and that is that
you work with one hand while i am ambidextrous

  i have heard of that you were born that way
and when your most wise parents discovered it they
were wise enough to let you cultivate the use of both
hands thus in operating where there is but little
room it is as though two surgeons were operating but
there is only one body

  just my good fortune admitted the american
but what do you think of the future of surgery  does
it not appear to you that our specialty lags behind the
other sciences in every other field the greatest ad-
vances are being made but in our field all we have done
is to obtain a slightly greater technical skill

  i have done a few things whispered the yellow
man almost as though he were making the modest state-
ment to himself

  rumors of those things have crossed the ocean
but only rumors no one knows what i have in
mind i have talked to no one published nothing
but you did not kill your successes i saw the bridge
builder the chief of the trans-pacific steel company
no he did not betray any secrets but i saw that arm
he had a dislocation of the elbow and that was the way
i saw it

  wing loo smiled the inscrutable mysterious smile
of the orient

  and when i saw that arm hopkins continued i
knew that you had done something that would revolu-
tionize surgery

  it was nothing sighed the chinaman the man
had his arm torn so badly that amputation was neces-
sary i simply transplanted the arm of a cooley

i know that much there was a difference in the
colors of the two arms

 of course i took all precautions the man who
 furnished that arm was in perfect health

 naturally you would not want your patient to be-
 come diseased through his new arm i know your pride
 well enough to realize that you would not overlook the
 slightest factor in an operation like that i must admit
 that i do not know how you do it-but the fact that you
 do it is what brought me to china

 you honor me said the oriental

 not at all your work honors you more than any
 individual could but my visit is almost a selfish one
 briefly speaking i want you to operate on me

 now indeed you are honoring me you mean that
 you pass by bloodgard of new york smathers of lon-
 don verdin of paris and the great experimenter largo
 of rome and come to me for an operation

 that is what i did but i did not pass them by i
 saw them all on my way east and they all said the same
 thing

 and that was

 wing loo of canton is the only man who has even
 thought of performing that kind of an operation

 in spite of his imperturbability the yellow hand
 handling the ivory cigarette holder trembled

 and so i came to ask of you a favor

 yes

 i want you to operate on my brain

 on your brain

 absolutely the best neurologists in america have
 diagnosed a brain tumor on the right frontal lobe there
 is evidence to show that it is slowly growing un-
 checked it will some day destroy my mentality even now
 the public knowledge that such a tumor existed in my
 brain would absolutely check my surgical career no
 one would want me to operate on him he would be
 afraid

 what do you want me to do

 remove that portion of my brain replace it with
 a similar portion of brain from a normal person and
 send me back to america for twenty more years of use-
 fulness to my nation

 how do you know that i can do all this

 i do not know i can only hope


amazing stories

  but the brain is different from the arm decay is
rapid the slightest injury leads to almost instant de-
generation of the cells you know that this fact is the
reason back of our lack of progress in neurology

  i realize all that at the same time i believe that
you can do it

  i can do it the oriental admitted i can do it in
fact i have done it in my home i have a little toy
dog a pekingese it is running around in the best of
health and spirits but controlling the body there is
the brain of another dog but with a human being it
may be different

  it might be different admitted dr hopkins if
i asked you to transplant the entire brain or even one
half of it but all i want is to have the frontal lobe
on one side replaced men have lived without the
frontal lobe and have done some work but not surgery
i talked with some men in vienna and they still feel
that the use of this part of the brain is unknown some-
thing only to be guessed at but perhaps in some way
connected with memory at least there is no motor
function

  this lobe has to be removed from my brain or
the tumor will kill me if the frontal lobe on the right
side is removed it will have to be replaced with some-
thing or pressure changes will cause deterioration of the
previously healthy brain why not replace the diseased
lobe with a healthy one said dr hopkins

  you think it will have no effect on your surgery

  i am confident of it

  and for twenty years you will be still considered the
worlds greatest operator

  the second greatest doctor after you i come
i will do as you request the asiatic at last said it
will take time i must make careful preparations take
accurate measurements it will not be easy to find a
man with the same cranial contours-who is willing to
take part in such an operation

  of course i will pay him well

  if i find the man he will be glad to do it-without
pay there was a slight smile on the yellow face as
wing loo said this in the meantime i want you
to become my guest my humble home will be honored
by your worthy presence in a month perhaps in less
time all will be ready before the operation i will
explain my technique

three weeks passed during those three weeks
dr hopkins was indeed an honored guest in the
palace of the greatest surgeon of the east

  then he was called to the surgeons office

  you have been at leisure dr hopkins purred the
chinaman

  very much so

  you have thought of other things besides surgery
  i am afraid so

  but after play comes work we must begin here
is what i do i take your entire body and rapidly freeze
it while it is frozen i operate then i thaw the
body and inject adrenalin into the heart active life is
renewed in the years to come freezing will replace
chloroform and ether as a general anaesthetic for all
operations

  it cannot be done dr wing loo declared hop-
kins shaking his head emphatically take a piece of
meat and freeze it at once there is a destruction of
cells the water in the meat turns to crystal ice and

in expanding destroys the cell wall place the meat in
a warm room and at once decay putrefaction sets in
am i right or wrong

  both if the process of freezing is slow gradual
you are right but i do not use that method i take
the person to be operated on and place him in a steel
cylinder where the temperature is fifty degrees below
zero the freezing takes place so rapidly that there is
no time for the water to form crystals the entire body
simply becomes a piece of frozen suspended animation
i can then raise the temperature to ten degrees below
zero and keep the animal in that state for days

  let me show you i open this box here are two
eels both frozen by my method with a forceps i pick
one up and throw it on the floor it shatters to bits as
though it were made of glass i place the other in this
vase of hot water see it will soon come to life and
move already it begins to quiver and that eel has
been frozen for over d year

  all this is new to me admitted hopkins but you
have to be near the body to operate how can you re-
tain any delicacy of touch at ten degrees below zero 
the person i operate on answered the chinese
surgeon is in a glass case above the site of operation
my instruments are suspended i sit at a table by the
cylinder the field of operation is made visible to me by
a series of mirrors i press little buttons and the in-
struments above the patient do my bidding the opera-
tion is always perfect because it is entirely mechanical
there is no chance for the slip of a nervous hand
but how about your arteries  i can understand that
there is no bleeding while the operation is going on
but afterwards 

  i have a special method of approximating the ends
of nerves and arteries replied the oriental smiling
this is my own discovery and you must pardon me if
i keep it to myself at least for a few years but rest
assured that there isno bleeding and that the operative
wound heals rapidly

  i can only say that i am astonished admitted dr
hopkins

  if you were an oriental doctor you would be as-
tonished at nothing that happens

  perhaps you are right

  and now that you have my idea my method of oper-
ating do you still want to take the risk

  i think soi the headaches are growing worse
some days i am not sure of my own personality i
think that i have done things-in china-that i would
not have done under ordinary circumstances

  so many people act that way in china even when
they are well however human conduct is a very
singular thing i will operate tomorrow

  you have the other man selected

  indeed yes

  and he is willing

  so far he has not questioned the desirability of the
procedure

  will you let me pay him 

  no indeed this entire operation is a present from
a beginner in surgery to the worlds greatest operator
the only ambidextrous surgeon on this earth

  i shall be glad to get it over with sighed hopkins
the way i have been feeling the peculiar ideas i have
had lately the way i have been acting-anything even
death will be a change for the better

  death is a great adventure dr hopkins
the ambidexter



  i agree with you dr wing loo

  the next day the american was rolled into the steel
cylinder where the temperature was always under fifty
degrees below zero all struggling was prevented by a
light preliminary nitrous oxide anaesthesia in a short
time life was suspended all animation at an end later
on the body lay on the operating table the battery of
glistening instruments was suspended above it and all
enclosed in a glass case on one side sat the surgeon
and in front of him was a table of push buttons every
consecutive step of the operation had been arranged for
the necessary instrument for each detail was in place
and the mechanism necessary to enable that instrument
to make the proper movements was in perfect order as
dr wing loo sat there looking at his invention he
could not help smiling in a pleased way

  it is perfect he admitted to himself it is so
mechanically perfect that i could make a robot to sit here
and press the buttons that will come in time and
now for the operation my mirrors are working per-
fectly i will soon be able to see if the diagnosis of
tumor of the right frontal lobe is correct he pressed
a button

  a small circular saw descended on the forehead of
the american and started to cut its way through the
frozen flesh and frontal bone

a month later the two surgeons again sat in dr
wing loos office

  i am feeling fine said dr hopkins i have spent
a part of each day with my right hand in my pocket and
my left hand performing imaginary operations with my
nail file and manicure scissors as instruments and as
far as i can judge that hand has lost none of its dex-
terity by having a part of its controlling cerebrum re-
placed if you have some simple operation to do i
should like to operate before i leave china and in that
operation use first one hand and then the other it will
be interesting for you to watch me and make notes so
your case history will be complete

  i think that can be arranged for dr hopkins but
it will be years before your case history will be com-
plete

  no doubt but you never told me about the tumor
was it harmless or a glioma and how is the poor
fellow doing who contributed his brain to my welfare
oh the tumor was a harmless variety though it
was causing pressure symptoms as far as the man was
concerned i beg of you do not worry about him i am
sure that he feels honored to think that a piece of his
insignificant brain is reposing in the cranial cavity of
the greatest surgepn in the world

  i wish you would stop saying that doctor i am
sure that if the world ever knew what you were doing
in the way of experimental surgery they would worship
at your shrine

  the time has not come for that someday perhaps-
after you have died of old age if i am then alive but
now i do not want to take your honor from you and
you look so much younger since the operation
hopkins looked at himself in the long mirror on one
side of the room he smiled as he pushed the hair
away from his forehead

  it was a clever piece of surgery doctor the scar is
hardly perceptible and when the hair grows longer no
one will know i have been operated on i really did not
want it known so few people have confidence in a man

who has had brain surgery we had a general with a
brain tumor and i know the man was capable but the
war department thought they could not trust his judg-
ment of course you will keep this operation a pro-
fessional secret

  certainly dr hopkins

  the two men looked at each other it was as though
two fencers had paused for a moment to decide on the
next attack

  but you will know and i will know doctor the
asiatic said finally that there was an operation

  i will never forget that

  no you will never forget that

  a week later dr hopkins performed a very delicate
operation first he used the right hand and then he
used the left wing loo watched him and at the end
complimented him highly

  your left hand was mechanically perfect doctor
i felt so of course i will continue to plan my
operations with the left side of my brain that is where
the speech centers are you know the orders will be
conveyed to the right brain and through those centers re-
layed to the muscles of the arm the neurology of the
central nervous system is all very interesting doctor
it certainly is agreed the oriental

  the following month dr hopkins reeturned to
chicago on the long ocean voyage he had an unusual
opportunity to think his final conclusions were that
he was gloriously alive very fortunate and extremely
capable of years of more work he also felt that in some
ways he had been a trifle foolish in china and that some
of the statements made by wing loo had been a little
childish

  the average oriental is a queer mixture of savant
and youth he said to hiniself at the same time he
was very kind to me and when i arrive at chicago i
must send him a worth-while present perhaps a com-
plete set of my writings bound in half morocco would
be appropriate

  he had been away from his office for months and he
found a lot of work accumulated there was a number
of wealthy individuals who needed operations but who
wanted to wait till the great master could give them
individual care as usual he selected his cases giving
individual preference only to those who could give him
either the greatest financial reward or the largest modi-
cum of glory when not operating he lectured to his
classes or read scientific papers before medical societies

  immediately on arriving in chicago he had turned
all the resources of his surgical laboratory towards the
duplication of the surgical innovations that he had seen
used in china some of his technicians laughed at him
while others long haired and wild-eyed enthused over
being allowed to participate in such revolutionizing
studies the greatest secrecy was preserved when the
time came for an announcement to the world dr hop-
kins wanted all the glory

another month passed and then a year and then
two years the great chicago surgeon was asked
to operate on the daughter of the richest man in amer-
ica it was not a difficult operation simply the removal
of a harmless tumor from the girls neck hopkins de-
cided to do it in his private operating room alone under
local anaesthesia hours later the door of the operating
room was forced open and the poor girl found dead
on the operating table the head completely severed


amazing stories

from the body dr emanuel hopkins had disappeared
prolonged and persistent search failed to obtain the
slightest clue

  his friends remembering the brain tumor placed the
kindest construction on it and told the world that he had
gone suddenly insane and in this condition had com-
mitted murder and suicide a week later the murder
was forgotten in the interest aroused by the gangster
murder of twelve bootleggers from detroit

  it was spring time in china dr wing loo sat in
deep meditation as he slowly scratched the head of his
favorite pekingese the dog he had operated on years
before

  some day he will come back he said to himself
my tong brother in chicago writes of a strange
murder and an equally peculiar disappearance some-
day he will come back to me my beautiful experiment
my occidental brother my dear damned fool

  as though an unseen hand were pulling the wire to
make the human puppets dance the thing that the china-
man felt sure was going to happen took place that very
day dr hopkins came to the office and asked for an
interview only the card handed in by the servant told
that the man was the one-time great american surgeon
the writer who walked into the office was haggard and
bent and there was a look of furtive fear on his face

  so you have come back my dear doctor whispered
the oriental

  i have come back answered the man from chicago
across the continent and the pacific i have come back

to you i have come back-

  you have said that three times interrupted the
chinaman once would have been once too many i
can see that you have come back to me without being
told so often the voice was sharp and cut like a knife
but the american looked at him and repeated the objec-
tionable phrase

  i say that i have come back to you what did you
do to me and why did you do it

  you mean the operation

  certainly

  why i did just what you asked me to do

  no doubt but there was something that you hid
from me there was something you did to me that i
was not prepared for

  the chinaman shook his head and rejoined

  you have to tell me more about it i certainly have
not the least idea of what you are talking about i
thought that when you left china you were more than
pleased with the results of my surgery you told me
that you had remained perfectly ambidextrous that your
left hand was as good as the right you operated for
me and showed me your cleverness i thought you ap-
proved of my work as i remember you sent nie a
present a set of your medical writings bound in half
morocco and now you seem to find fault what hap-
pened 

  have you any whiskey

  very good liquor of all kinds

  get me some my nerves are at the breaking point
-ah that has a kick to it-liquid fire in that de-
canter

  that is very old peach brandy years ago it was
made for my honorable grand-father

  lucky for me he did not drink it all now for the
story explain it if you can i left you in perfect health
and returned to chicago i at once started to operate

and i was more clever than ever before it seemed that
the rest and the operation did me a world of good my
reputation became greater than ever my clinics were
filled by students from all parts of the world there
were even some chinamen there

  i sent them there-to observe you

  spy on me was that it perhaps they told you of
my ability but there was one thing they did not tell
you because they did not know about it after a while
i noticed a difference in my thinking-while i was oper-
ating i would keep on planning and arranging for the
next step my mind as usual a few minutes or seconds
ahead of the knife that part of me was working per-
fectly but whenever i used my left hand there seemed
to be a desire to operate poorly i did not understand it
at first but finally i realized that it was not a desire to
do poor work but an obsession to mutilate destroy
tear and cut and ravish as soon as i realized it i be-
came frightened in my abdominal work i forced my-
self to use only the right hand but now and then i
would forget and the left hand would take the knife and
slash-and then there would be busy silent moments and
rapid work with the haemostats

  can you understand what i am saying do you
see what i mean the right hand operating perfectly
for the cure of suffering humanity and the left hand
waiting silently for a chance to kill

  but you told me that both hands were under the
control of the left brain that it was there you did all
the programme work and that the right brain simply
carried the messages the orders from the other side
said the chinese surgeon

  i know that i told you that and my left brain is still
in control at least i think so but in chicago the
struggle continued-and at last i knew that it was a
struggle between the two sides of the brain-not the
two hands or arms but between the two frontal lobes
and only one of them was mine the other you placed
within my skull they fought for the mastery but i
won at least for a long time i won i claimed a neu-
ritis of my left arm and for months operated with it
in a sling and then my chance came to win the battle
i have told you all this because i want you to under-
stand do you

  i am sure i do

  i was asked to perform a simple operation on the
daughter of the richest man in my country i had my
left arm tied to my side with ropes and then i went
into my private operating room with the girl and shut
the door i used local anaesthesia i was going to
prove to myself that my left brain was the dominant one
and then the temptation came i started to operate and
all the time the left hand and arm were straining to be
free and more and more i wanted it to be free so at
last i took a knife and cut the ropes that held it fast-
and that hand of mine-that left hand almost jumped
forward and took a knife and decapitated that poor
child and my body my right hand couldnt do any-
thing to stop it that is what happened of course i
fled from the country no jury in america would be-
lieve my story think of the papers the headlines
peculiar defence offered noted surgeon claims this to
be a left handed murder states that the rest of his
body was not in sympathy with the hand that used the
knife so i made my getaway and i came to see you
because i am sure you know what is the matter with me
do you
the ambidexter



  i think so

  then tell me before i go insane

  it is very simple you  came to my house as my
guest i was very kind to you but during the weeks
before the operation you played a-round my house
there was a little chinese girl-

  only a servant-and only as a joke

  she was my daughter what was i to do you
were my guest and i had promised to operate on you
but i had to have a healthy frontal lobe to replace your
diseased one a criminal was to be decapitated at that
time i obtained his head and his right frontal lobe is
now in your skull

  a criminal 

  yes he was a really bad man he was not con-
tent with just killing he wanted to mutilate destroy
terrify by the appearance of his victims so ong tong
came to a bad end after killing many many people but
a part of his brain now is your property and evidently
it remembered the conduct of its past owner and the
frontal lobe of a degenerate chinaman-need i say
more

  the american looked at the chinaman the oriental
continued to scratch the head of the pekingese dog on
his lap

  and you did all this on purpose 

  certainly you will admit that i had to do some-
thing-to save my face

the

  i suppose so now let me tell you something my
life is ruined i cannot open my skull and take out that
yellow brain on my right side but i can keep this poor
left arm from doing any more ruin it has committed
murder once but that is no reason why it should do it
again i am not going to kill you i ought to but in
a way you are right i suppose i was a cur but i
didnt know it was your daughter honest i didnt
wing loo so this is my final gesture

   he took a long knife an amputating knife from his
pocket and with the skill of a master he cut off his left
hand and placed it on the table between them then he
fainted

   the oriental rang a gong his private secretary an-
swered

   our friend has taken the honorable way of escape
dr wing loo announced take him from here and
let his blood flow as he desired but place him at once
in the cold chamber the left side of his brain is in per-
fect condition and so are his right arm and hand it
may be that when old age changes and withers my brain
i shall want to use his brain for a little while-just for
a little while

  the room cleaned the body removed wing loo sat
day-dreaming in his chair he picked up the little dog
and playfully bit his ears

  and now he said to the dog i can honestly say
that i am the greatest surgeon in the world

cosmic power

  by john c dare

continued from page 

drawn the circle smaller and each plane played a heat
ray on the sand surrounding the plant

  the heat inside the building was now becoming al-
most unbearable sweat pouring from them in streams
the men began tearing off their clothes

  why doesnt the professor do something gasped
smith is he going to allow us to be cooked alive

  the plane bearing the white flag wilsons plane had
joined the cluster of planes over the plant and the
cluster rose a thousand feet higher than the circle below
suddenly wilson gave a signal every heat ray con-
verged simultaneously on the plant

  wilson licked his fat lips in anticipation expecting to
see the plant go to pieces in a mass of exploding con-
crete

  as the four hundred heat rays converged on the net-
ting four hundred jagged streaks of lightning simul-
taneously sprang from the point of contact following
up the beams of ionized air which formed a perfect
conductor they licked hungrily at the planes enveloped
them sprang eagerly from plane to plane for an in-
stant there was a gigantic wheel of living pulsing light
where the planes had been an earth-shaking detonation
followed planes pilots guns and bombs exploded
under the lash of that titanic force the taut cables
thrumbed like a giant tuning fork as the remains of the
armada rained down in a welter of falling debris

  the thing had happened in a tenth of a second just
a flash a detonation and four-fifths of the enemy blasted
into eternity

  the planes above the plant thrown upward by the
blast from below lost four planes in the ensuing con-

the

fusion two collided and fluttered slantingly down out
of control to fall half a mile away bombs exploding as
they struck two others struck the power cables and
fell into the water

  cherron white and shaking from the concussion
climbed to the tower on the roof where he found the
professor jaws clamped on a cigar humped over a long
tubular apparatus it looked like a six-inch field piece
with leads of wire entering the breech he was watch-
ing the planes above

  three planes left the cluster as they watched and
dived toward the plant

   swiftly three scintillating balls of fire left the tube
over which the professor crouched swift as light
they sped and with uncanny accuracy each landed fair
on the fusilage of a separate plane

  the planes vanished three balls of purple smoke
drifted lazily away on the breeze

  suddenly the professor seemed to make up his mind
there was no use waiting or trying to show mercy
those devils above would fight to the last with them
it was either win all or lose all

   from plane to plane he turned the deadly tube like
water from a hose poured the livid stream of fire

   two minutes of that lethal fire play and a solitary
plane with a fluttering white pennant sped away north-
ward toward safety

  professor vondig hesitated a moment then humped
closer over the tube his jaws clamped tighter a single
scintillating ball shot from the tube and five miles away

         among other meritorious uses that might be found for atomic-driven ma-
      ja chinery would be excavators-that is after we had learned to use and con-
      trol the energy supposedly hidden in the atom that suggests a new thought if
      all atoms are possessed of this boundless energy then every grain of sand could be
      put to beneficial labor what about the danger involved in tampering with atomic
      forces jvell there is tremendous danger in tampering with electricity just
      imagine the help a bag of sand for instance would provide in the work of
      digging and excavating work but many things might happen-as witness the
      story our new author has woven around this theory

         its a corking good story-and different

  one of our children has just left us-forever she
fell over the edge of the precipice on race street into
a hell thousands of miles deep even that doesnt
seem real

  i threw myself flat on the brink of that appalling drop
heedless of the hot scorching sun on my back shad-
ing my eyes i peered over the babys crumpled body
lay faintly outlined in a patch of starlight

  yes i may be mad but it is night on that precipice
night though the sun beats down on my neck bear
with me a little longer hilda my first wife came to
me even when a bristling snarling creature of that hell
below took our child away in its slavering jaws

  brace up bob she said we cant go on like
that

  events tread upon one anothers heels in our lives
sorrow joy labor mingle indiscriminately hilda led
me back to the great benjamin franklin memorial in
which my family huddle like frightened sheep the
evening meal is being prepared the odor of the stew
floats from the wide portals as i recline on the steps
and rest my head against one of the columns hilda
is speaking to me as the rest of the family gather in
sympathy

  marys nineteen now bob she is saying she
comes of a hardy family  

  i want to rebel at the fate that left me the only man
but i cannot rebel for these women see the human race
imperilled ah if only i had not joined in those fiend-
ish experiments six years ago

  mary will be my seventh wife

duty

in  i was single and restless free to roam
to work or to play i craved change above every-
thing else if a new experience was offered by
a change i made the change and thus it was
when joel murch came to me

  the time is now  six years two months and three
days later as nearly as i can figure it i have a family
now its members fret and scold and sigh for the past
to hold their minds and thoughts to a steady course
i point out the familiar objects still recognizable the
ruins of temple university on the roof of which some
south american condors are nesting the leaning tower
of the old city hall the skeleton remains of wana-
makers the tumbled walls of a once popular motion
picture palace and so on my words have a negative
result im a poor hand at disguising my own longings
when tormented too much i rise up and say think
of me and smile six years ago i was a bachelor shun-
ning all women and today- but words fail me i
never finish

  my whole life seems in the nature of a dream from
which ill wake up in some future generation among my
friends once more and the old sights and sounds death
lurks everywhere monstrous beasts move about blind-
ly and sluggishly feeling as strange here as we do the
streets are covered with refuse they teem with strange
life while overhead sea-fowl blacken the skies

  my burdens are bearing me down reason totters
at times perhaps im already cracked

amazing stories

the second earth

the ben franklin memorial is our citadel for in it
we find safety and also copies of mans machines
and devices with which to remake our lives the
metal worm only is missing and i curse the memory
of it we have a radio that receives its power from
one of these worms still operating after the recent
catastrophe this worm will generate energy for cen-
turies perhaps forever daily hilda sends out into the
thinning atmosphere a message of our location but with-
out success no one comes no one answers we are
alone

  hilda wants to gather together what is left of the
race she is feverish about it and afraid she wants
children scores of them if we dont multiply well
drift back to savage indolence well care for nothing
but the easing of natural wants the warped and
wounded earth will go to its doom without a human
being to ride it there

  if your friend dr murch could be found that
is her hope he knew so much about our machine age
he could teach the children-

  i shake my head patiently but well not find joel
i interrupt if he is alive he is out there on the
second earth he is battling to live as we are i
told you that before

  we sit and talk our eyes seeking the second earth
swinging lopsidedly across the arc of the heavens
weve been doing that every day with a faint prayer
that our vigil might be rewarded by a signal or sign
the second earth is a pale orange today soon she
and the moon will ride rivals full and bright surely
the second earth must be well lit with her two moons
of which our planet is one now

  mary touches me gently on the arm

  ill never forget that day she says

  you were a child then

  yes and my impressions are muddled answers
mary even to a child it was terrible mother was
dragging me by the hand there was smoke and fire
and steam airplanes like bees swarming the ground
shaking buildings falling and streets caving in my
eyes burned from the smoke people were dying all
about me and laughing and laughing while they died
others laughed with them how i cried i hid be-
hind a broken-down wall with my eyes closed and my
ears stopped up with my fingers people couldnt stop
others pushed them on from the rear over the raw
bridges and the seething fires at last i was left alone
and i went away from there back to where everything
seemed still and safe

  and that mary adds hilda saved you for our
little world

  the smell of the stew assails my nostrils my family
see my questing glance

  dinners far off yet one of them offers and at a
hint from another i am reminded of a task id promised
to do but which i hadnt started yet alice brings
me paper mary brings me a pen fortunately though
were castaways on a deserted world were not without
supplies

  i count noses my brood is complete and peace seems
to be upon us for the time being the story has to be
told-somehow others would come after us and theyd
want to know and so with a slab of indiana lime-
stone for a desk i begin my tale

i go with joel

joel and i were boyhood friends he devoted his
life to labor-saving devices for mankind and was
happy in doing so but i was bored because the
position i held then was a routine one and tiresome
he came to me one day with no hint of what was in
his mind

  same thing day after day eh he asked

 yes why

  do you like it couldnt a college graduate do
that work

of course but i need the money more than he

  and you have various degrees and other append-
ages 

say joel and i bridled up you neednt rub it in

  im not he returned im merely plotting your
future 

my pen is resting i do not feel impelled to tell
the story im thinking of the baby in the maw
of the precipice a dirty form lumbers by slowly
bobbing up and down how forlorn a hippopotamus
can be i am cheered its waddling toward the
schuylkill looking for water and will find a mud flat
instead for the river is drying out rapidly

  my pen scratches away again

we didnt know where we were heading when we
started if i had known id have made away
with him and myself on the spot rather than do what
we did

  however we werent to know the power of divina-
tion wasnt ours we went blindly about wrecking the
earth the end-we saw it too soon all the natural
laws which had governed this planet for countless
geologic ages went by the board we went about this
blithely happily what a fool i was i did it with
a sense of high accomplishment it was something suit-
ing my learning and inclinations i thought

  joels inventions were not many but they were out-
standing he was always trying out new ideas costing
huge sums sometimes with no returns that didnt
matter the golden stream poured in without pause
when he offered me five times my salary i knew he
could afford it when he added a new experimental
laboratory which i was to design i accepted and very
quickly

  and bob joel finished softly nothing to do for
all this but to play around in the lab try out theories
and hob-nob with me as two chums and bachelors
should no taskmaster no routine your hours free
as the circumambient air what do you say 

  what could i say three days later surveyors
marked off a plot of ground on joels country estate
near willow grove busy weeks followed cost he
told me to forget it to wish was to realize hed
have put in a -inch telescope if id thought wed
need it the laboratory went up fast no mushroom
ever grew faster   

my pen idles again i pause to remember and to
look for my tobacco alice and sid promptly
supply the needed articles the childrens shining faces
are on me with rare filial devotion and respect as i
look into that small sea of faces i feel more unreal
than ever i feel like a patriarch or a sachem with all
the laughing death



the wisdom of the ages behind me for the sake of
the children i must go on i take a long pull at my
pipe and push my pen along

  

  when the laboratory was ready to be equipped loaded
vans arrived with thousands of books hand-picked
books joel wanted researches along certain lines he
didnt say so but the text of the books pointed the way
i didnt suspect then and when i did i was already deep
in the studies joel had set out for me the stage was
too invitingly set i fell naturally into a heaven a
scientists heaven

  it was the same with the equipment i ordered gen-
erously too much so i was lavish a veto wouldnt
have surprised me there were barrels packing boxes
and bundles everywhere some opened some untouched
there was glass underfoot joel came in glanced
around and then whacked me on the back until the
empty spaces shook with his laughter after a few
words he wandered off wading through excelsior with a
pad and pencil the results of his visit soon became
apparent draymen unloaded new shipments none that
i remembered ordering there was one article in
particular

  a furnace i exclaimed i touched the tempera-
ture and pressure gauges for making artificial dia-
monds if that heat gauge is to be used to its highest
reading well have the hottest inferno ever made by
man

  i hope so was joels answer i built it myself
and tested it out last week in the old lab thought
wed find it useful here

  the next day he moved in with his personal equip-
ment  and when the last workman had left we plunged
into an orgy of haphazard research if we happened to
discuss some idea as we sat smoking our pipes late at
night very likely id produce the reaction the following
morning or even drag joel with me through the long
entry that connected our quarters with the laobratory
proper and late though the hour might be go about
proving the points of my contention with test tube and
bunsen burner

  several months passed and i noticed that our nightly
discussions in which we took so much delight most of
the time oblivious to the flight of the hours had drifted
into the field of physics and it struck me as odd that
joel whether victorious or not in these tilts invariably
withdraw for such little sleep as he seemed to fequire
with a secret sense of glee i saw this in the merest
smile that lingered about his lips

  one warm evening seized by a common impulse we
walked many miles with arms swinging freely except
when we wished to lend emphasis to some argument
our stroll brought us into the center of the city we
approached this very building in which we live now
as if drawn to it by the spirit that abode within its
walls

  how different the scene here was then to the east
in front of where i write this was a rising sky line one
building mounting higher than the other boulevards
ran in all directions there were lights a second broad-
way traffic life gayety i shudder to think what has
taken the place of all this there is no horizon before
me the sky bends down and disappears in that bottom-
less abyss

joel led me to a seat here in logan square where we

could watch the ceaseless stream of cars circling about
us

disturbing thoughts

tob i love this business of transportation joel
spoke the means man uses for getting him-
-- self about are ever changing we couldnt
have advanced far without this development

  for a while we were silent watching the traffic
when primitive man he continued first cut out
round slices from a tree-trunk and used these for wheels
to replace his drags he took his initial step toward free-
dom from physical toil then it was that civilization
was born

  what about the discovery of fire i asked

  to tell the truth bob he conceded i dont know
which came first it doesnt matter though because
 still think the same today the united states with
fifteen times more automobiles and ten times more ships
in the air than the rest of the world put together is the
strongest power on earth no one disputes that ef-
fective means of getting about spell good times and
national prestige to keep uncle sam at the head of
the parade bob we have to keep improving and speed-
ing up transportation

  can we i asked the average speed is already
 miles per hour

  that will be like standing still soon but speed isnt
the only question involved

  what else can it be perhaps you mean space
traveling out there among the planets

  there is certainly room for development there
he replied however that line of progress is likely

to be blocked for many generations unless- and his

voice died out in inward reflection he was looking
at the glowing neon lights everywhere the people the
moving splashes of color that made up city night life
without seeing anything

  what do you mean joel i saw sadness in his
face

  war bob war he answered every generation
has had its own conflict even now we expect it
soon the witches caldron will boil over and hell will be
loosed again

  i couldnt agree with him

  suppose there is a war i said its not all loss
in the civil war the iron clad was created the fore-
runner of todays steel vessels in the same war count
zeppelin while serving here conceived his dirigible
in the world war the airplane received its greatest
impetus and there too medicine and plastic surgery
made great strides

  all true bob all true of past wars but the next
will be different

  you mean i said slowly new weapons will be
used poison gases disease germs injurious insects
wholesale slaughter in a split second with new rays and
the inhabitants of the earth finally driven underground
for safety

  thats it bob thats it and think of this when
the whole world begins to burrow madly into the ground
to live and build cities there how much time will be
devoted to the navigation of interplanetary space
none man will have enough other troubles in his new
abode underground

it seems hopeless i murmured by an unlucky


amazing stories

chance taken unaware the whole earth could be wiped
clean of the human race

  and its likely to happen too unless-

  you said that before joel i remarked unless
what

  his answer seemed irrelevant at first

  last night he said i paid the final bills on the
new laboratory and its equipment and he mentioned
the total cost

  i was startled dumfounded

  thats nothing bob the profits on my subway dig-
ger during the year took care of that and theres the
point bob my digger in this war i speak of faster
means of digging-in will be needed time is short too
bob he lowered his voice for a stranger occupied
the other end of our bench war he said deliber-
ately will be on us at any time

  war i retorted too loudly perhaps preposter-
ous tariffs and dry laws dont make wars

  his remark troubled me i looked more closely to see
if he showed any signs of illness

  he laughed shortly you think im mad or joking
i dont blame you bob i wanted to fly down to the
secretary of war several times since i discovered what
i know but the fear of being discredited stayed the
impulse

  you must be wrong joel i said id have de-
tected the signs i keep abreast of the times

  joel answered me tonelessly i heard some queer
picking sounds on my radio one night it was a code
unknown to me and it came in very faintly during
the war as you know my chief duty was to decode the
enemys messages when the code came through at
the same hour every night i got busy and took the
message down on my teletypewriter out of mere
curiosity i applied myself to the unraveling of the mes-
sages any secret writing can be solved in time you
know but this one had me nearly baffled it was the
work of a genius when i had it solved at last my
fears knew no bounds it was then that i wanted to
rush down to washington

  fortunate you didnt i answered it isnt pleas-
ant to be laughed at by a nation

  im afraid youre right he agreed with a sudden
change of voice

  its probably a prank of some college boys playing
with a laboratory set i hastened to offer its col-
legiate to learn esperanto write in code believe in
schopenhauer and his ilk just as it was thought clever
ten years ago to wear a coonskin and carry something
liquid on the hip

  now isnt that so bob funny i never thought
of that before its a great relief to realize that all my
fears have been in vain    its getting late and
im tired after the walk lets catch the air bus

  twenty minutes later we alighted at the laboratory
in willow grove we lingered near the entry leading
to our workship as if we both had something still on
our minds and the next thing we knew we were again
seated in the lab den smoking

        getting ready

id you notice i was saying how popular sub-
waysare 

  yes joel was quite willing to talk on
this theme theyre going in for underground con-

courses too wide streets with store fronts doing busi-
ness under the surface people find these cool in the
summer and warm in winter and never subject to the
vagaries of the weather as above

  philadelphias taking bids for a tube i said from
camden to upper darby under both rivers

  id like to get that bid

 why

  it would give us a chance to experiment

  youre still thinking of war i concluded and re-
gretted having started the subject

  yes he admitted

  in that case i said we can build that tube to
chester too and after that why not the tunnel under
the english channel

i was joking of course but he took me seriously
we conferred through the night let him dig the
subway i thought he couldnt lose while at the same
time this foolish idea of war might be mislaid in the
shuffle of events

  it didnt matter if i did lose bob he argued its
a price id be willing to pay

  well why not bid on the job any way and work
on the improvement of your digger in the meantime
good idea he said forcefully cheered by my
words and though it was four in the morning he
reached for a telephone and aroused the head of a firm
of estimators his instructions were brief after he had
explained the purpose of his call

  get the lowest cost figures rex he said and
enter murch  co as bidders on the job for one-half
of the cost figures yes one-half dont pad the
figures either

  there was an excited burst of talk from the other
end of the line but joel hung up with a laugh

  he thinks im crazy thinks my philanthropy is
pointless wasted council is a bunch of crooks and so
on pearls before swine murch  co will get that
contract as sure as fate there will be a protest of
course but ill file a heavy bond in the morning

  you do things in a grand way i said by the
way am i member of this new firm

  you are

  in that case i said in a matter of fact voice i
move that we come to order and proceed with business
hear hear joels humor was now fully restored
since the senior member of the firm has written a
huge loss on the companys books the junior member
proposesto list his personal assets at once to help meet
said losses

  the move is not well taken interrupted joel the
junior member is-oh the devil with a change of
voice were wasting time bob i stand to lose mil-
lions if i depend on my digger in its present form
improve your digger then

  i designed it bob i know its limits

  in other words i guessed we come to the idea
of an entirely new excavator and a new kind of power 
yes and he told me the problems the new digger
would have to meet the ideal digger he concluded
would be the one that could complete the tunnel ready
for equipment in one operation just as a modern print-
ing press turns out a newspaper or the tailoring machine
turns out finished mens suits pressed and ready to
wear

  that would - require tremendous power and cheap
power too i remarked
the laughing death



  we began to talk of the sources of energy and the
composition of matter and as dawn peeked in through
the windows and we were sipping some coffee joel had
brewed in a little closet on the side we were fully
launched on atoms and how they could be torn apart

  listen joel i said standing up and walking the
length of the room in my eagerness were entering on
a field of thought shrouded in the deepest fog when
we speak of atoms and clutch after the power that is
contained within them we are tampering with forces

so immense so-

  joel was eagerness itself wheres your evidence
for this bob

  all around us i replied its been there for
countless ages astronomers have measured this re-
lease of energy among the stars often our universe
has wandered through the unmapped voids since the
beginning of time its billions of stars have been send-
ing out heat and energy during that period our own
planet has never been without the light and heat of
the sun for  years this throw-off of energy
has never been stopped common sense would tell us
these uncounted stars couldnt go on burning forever
without being renewed

  but asked joel couldnt these celestial furnaces
be kept up by the cosmic dust falling all the time and
the meteors and comets that go shooting through space 
i took another cup of coffee to ward off drowsiness
no i answered though they do contribute a little
take the sun for instance the temperature on its
surface is about  deg c while in the center it is
from  to  degrees you can see that
the renewal from the outside sources would affect only
the surface conditions and those very slightly no
joel the answer lies in the atom

  if thats the case said joel why didnt this break-
ing up of the atom long ago destroy the planets and
stars 

  thats actually going on i replied but its such
a long process that to set a date even in millions of years
would be short of the truth

  it doesnt seem plausible bob

  it is when you know the power in an atom a
grain of sand holds within its atoms a force capable of
destroying a large section of countryside think what
that means an atoms so small its invisible under the
microscope and yet in that tiny bulk is the power to
move a mountain

  well how are you to get this power out

  there are two theories only one is worth con-
sidering and thats the theory of annihilation we have
to break up the atom and release the electric charges
an atom under a super-microscope would be interesting
tc see it would show as a universe of tiny planets rush-
ing about each with its own path one might even
see a glow of electricity a sort of sun you know for
the atom world

  bob joel broke in springing up lets turn in
theres a firm in rochester making a new microscope
and im going up there to examine it and with an
abrupt good night he was gone

signs of trouble

in my own room again i pulled the shades down
against the early sun and slept when i awoke
later joel was already gone but he had left a
brief note on the breakfast table

    double check me he had written was that
stranger on our bench last night dr serge grubsnig
i was startled enough to spill my coffee dr grubs-
nig vaguely my mind had been grappling with the
strangers identity that explained why joel had so
suddenly dropped his talk of war and hastened our de-
parture from logan square dr grubsnig was the
leader of a secret organization of doubtful reputation
he had not only served a term in prison but had nar-
rowly escaped detention in an insane asylum his
presence in the city set me to thinking perhaps joels
suspicions were not ungrounded with the name of
this learned fanatic drawn into the plot one might ex-
pect any unpleasantness including even war of a kind

  my fears were soon forgotten in the absence of
joel i was besieged by newspaper reporters they
were all agog about joels bid the papers carried big
headliners they were astonished at the lowness of
the bid but not one authority doubted his ability to
build the subway though the political machine seeing
the loss of a plum to an outsider did raise a brief com-
motion to discredit him needless to say joel was
awarded the contract

  still there was no word from joel having re-
ceived no instructions to meet this situation i did the
only thing a man could do under the circumstances
when questioned by the reporters i explained joels
absence carefully and told them that i was not in a
position to say either this or that of course this made
it mysterious pictures of joel together with his life
story appeared in all the papers

  when joel finally did materialize i was greeted with
a friendly clap on the back that shook me to the roots
of my teeth

  great old man great he exclaimed as a pub-
licity man you have no peer

  rats i returned i didnt do anything just kept
my mouth shut looked serious and remained out of
reach as much as possible

  its an art bob its an art

  then you want this publicity

  it wont hurt but well discuss that later these
men cant wait long

  four men burdened with a bulky case had been wait-
ing quietly under joels instructions they placed what
i soon perceived was a microscope on the laboratory
table as he told me later joel had secured the use
of the instrument for a short time from the rochester
firm buying it was out of question it had been built
expressly for the designer if this device were free to
be used by the rest of the world it would extend im-
measurably the scope of all microscopic study

  for one week joel and i hovered about the new
instrument its magnifying powers amazed us a
drop of water became a storm-swept ocean filled with
densely teeming life a grain of sand was a whole moun-
tain range glittering with diamond-like brilliance

  there came a time when we frankly pursued the
elusive atom and those primitive charges of electricity
that were to be diverted to mans use such preliminary
details as cropped up in connection with the subway
job he relegated to my judgment he failed time after
time in trying to divide the atom mechanically some
other method seemed more likely to promise success

  one day several incidents impinged upon the quiet
of the laboratory i had dropped a tiny set-screw and
while kneeling on the floor under the microscope to re-


amazing stories

cover it i glanced upward a startled exclamation
drew joel down to me we traced the stamped letters
on the metal with our fingers to make sure

  dr grubsnigs i said meaningly

   hat carried us back to our talk in logan square and
to the stranger on our bench seemingly absorbed in the
passers-by this time i aired no ridicule at joels
prophecies although i still couldnt agree my mind
simply wouldnt consider war it was however a
coincidence that the microscope should be grubsnigs

  we had hashed over the entire evenings events when
i thought to ask a question have you listened in
on your radio lately joel i asked

  his face clouded over he pushed a buzzer for his
butler

  john he asked did you tune in every night as i
suggested 

  yes dr murch

  did the code come in as usual

  why no sir that first night a signal in code was
repeated every ten minutes for an hour as if the opera-
tor were trying to attract someones attention after
that the radio was silent thinking maybe that the
time had been changed i tuned in several times every
night but with no result

  did you translate the message

  im not a good hand at that sort of thing even with
your key dr murch the man answered but i do
think it was about the code being known and that it
wouldnt be used any more

  thank you john leave the message on my desk
that is all

  when the man was gone a deep silence fell upon us
another coincidence i said finally that the sig-
nals should stop on the night of our chat in logan
square it appears now like the workings of some
greater minds than those of mere college boys per-
haps this idea of war-

  i didnt finish the butler appeared again quietly
with a telegram

  something had happened the borrowed instrument
had to be returned by friday morning at the latest

  well thats the end of that he said regretfully
this man grubsnig suspects something    were
just learning the fine points of this marvel we have
some photographic records and thats all only four
days left its hopeless what can we do in that
time

  he leaned against the laboratory table wrearily i
was about to speak when joel gave vent to a cry of pain
and sprang away from the table he had touched a live
wire left lying on the table when i had stopped to pick
up the set screw

  its nothing he said just startled me he
hesitated stared at the wire and gave a shout look
out bob he warned jubilantly im about to trans-
cend myself get the camera study the motions of
your atom world quick well make use of their
gyrations yet wait and see that wire gave me an
idea

blundering success

four days with this incomparable microscope
all thought of a scientists proposed war on the
world faded before that fact the time seemed
too short joels joyous mutterings to himself went un-

noticed while he struggled with strange electrical ap-
paratus and to me a meaningless confusion of wires
i stared through the triple lenses until my eye muscles
ached i made many motion picture records of my
observations but so far as progress was concerned i
saw none all that night we labored neglecting subway
details and surveyors reports the laboratory perco-
lator did double duty when the first gray wisps of
dawn tinged the eastern sky i tumbled full length on
one of the couches in the corner with a wavering im-
pression of joel moving an improvised switch board
with a tangle of wires nearer to the microscope i fell
asleep with the drumming note in my mind three
days three days

  hours later the aroma of coffee and of frying bacon
in the butlets skillful hands and the bright sun across
my couch brought me back to life again joel had
cleared a section of the laboratory table and spreading
filter paper for a table cloth was setting up breakfast
we ate perched on high stools our legs twined about
the rungs

  im turning in he said wearily theres an atom
one atom of sand on the slide of the microscope which i
want you to examine its hooked up with the high
power cable i worked out the arrangement while you
slept experiment with it and jot down the results

  he wiped his lips with a piece of gauze and sought
obkvion in sleep

  several hours later i was prancing about the micros-
cope legs and arms my whole anatomy in motion all
except my eye which remained glued to the eye-piece
joel told me afterward that he had emerged from his
death-like slumbers and watched me for a long time in
amusement inarticulate sounds issued from my lips
pagan prayers to the various gods mingled with the
nameless words joel assured me my impatience when
evoked by some cause invisible to him was most enter-
taining throwing aside his langour at last he came to
my side and scrutinized the switch board and its spag-
hetti mass of wires

  those wires are not in their proper places he ob-
served in surprise his face wore a perturbed frown
theyre all mixed

  certainly i returned who cares your hook-
up didnt function it merely disturbed our work
then some of the wires fell from their sockets and
not knowing your scheme i did the best i could in
fact i grinned this strand from here to here point-
ing was not actually on your panel it was a stray
wire on the table and thinking it had dropped with the
others i found means to attach it in place but as
i remarked before who cares look

  i stepped aside shaking his head in obvious disgust
at my mishandling he placed his eye in position mean-
while above the hiss and the chatter of the current i
listened impatiently to the astronomers clock ticking
off the half seconds i tried to curb my irritation to give
joel a full undisturbed opportunity for observation

  fifteen twenty minutes dragged by then he called
for measuring instruments the butler appeared with
our lunch an hour later what little joel partook of it
i fed to him a bite at a time while he continued with-
out a word peering at the atom paper and pencil
were requisitioned upon which figures rained in pro-
fusion at last he either tired or finished with a
sigh he tore himself away from the lure of our atom
world
the laughing death



  well i asked simply

  a foozlers luck a blundering success he returned
frankly between your methods and mine there may
be an abysmal gulf but the two combined will yet bring
us out of the night why man alive  he almost stut-
tered waxing excited weve practically already done
the deed lets sit down somewhere and review the
miracle

  i felt a trifle chagrined look here joel i ob-
jected the gulf between our methods isnt so very
great a live wire burning your hand gave you the
idea-

  true true he admitted i take it all back

  in an alcove lit by soothing green lights we went
carefully over the history of what wed done we
checked off each step figured values needlessly to eight
decimal places and made sketches and diagrams sev-
eral times we made sundry tests of our sanity we
feared too that we couldnt long refrain from our
impetuous desire to shout the news from the house tops
to write of it to the learned societies to send transcripts
of it to the scientific journals nothing could have been
so disastrous to the safety of the world

  lets see joel was saying for the second time you
reported failure of my arrangement then you deliber-
ately mixed wires-or it amounts to the same thing-
selected them probably by closing your eyes and reciting
ecnic mcenie and so on you threw in an extra one
just because it happened to be lying under your hands
and lo and behold the tricks done or nearly so
youve sent a tremor through our atom world the
atom was on the verge of being wrecked as it is
youve probably started its transmutation into some
other element ye gods man weve got it weve
got it

  he threw his papers toward the ceiling and stood
blandly smiling under the white shower

  no he said at my startled backward step i havent
gone insane-yet its just celebration im just be-
ing exultant gay and so on when young dry old
fogies like ourselves do break out we do it with a
vengeance why bob weve opened up the atom
sliced it wide open you were right its a little uni-
verse with a central sun planets stars asteroids all
even nebulae did you notice that pink haze on the
outer fringes how it swirled and changed color

  i reached out and seized him by the arm

  put your brakes on a minute joel i beseeched
its exciting i know and fascinating a strange lure
seems to hold one to the eye-piece a sort of psychic
gravitational force i seemed to be drawn irresistibly
downward as if from a great height toward that atomic
sun but joel lets be calm theres no use acting
prematurely like a pair of crazy loons we nearly sent
these primitive forces off on a tangent but not quite
we have to remember that

  bob he replied gathering up his papers i feel
confident of the solution we cant expect to duplicate
the conditions in the sun but by the use of the furnace
with which you thought i planned to make diamonds
we can-well well see

  by the end of the evening meal he had produced a
definite outline of activity a heavy heat-resisting
metal cylinder was encased in a larger container of very
thick steel into this joel introduced a number of atoms
to be fed into the chamber proper by means of a spring
and valve of minute design once a drop of perspira-

  tion from my forehead drowned out two hours work

  there were moments before sunrise when i showed
myself to be completely out of my mind i recall mov-
ing all our equipment to the great furnace and of cutting
atoms but all else is hazy joel was a sweating ogre
to my weary eyes the astronomers clock sounded like
an infernal anvil as it measured time monotonously
my reeling mind had found a new refrain two
days two days

  when i awoke joel i found to my surprise had
chartered a plane and gone away with the microscope
to the factory as it developed later a note contained
brief instructions for me i was to turn on the current
for some minutes turn it off and observe the results

  i asked myself several questions as i moved the
switches wrould one atom set off another as a string
charged with gunpowder will burn rapidly from end
to end and what about the energy generated i
sprang across the room and out into the entry station-
ing myself behind the heavy oaken door and keeping it
open just enough to see into the laboratory

  what would the the outcome i waited excited
of course but with no special fear minutes passed
the pressure in the furnace mounted higher the hiss
and chatter of the current became faintly audible there
was a muffled roar a tremor ran through the building
the noise continued to swell in volume while the tem-
perature in the whole laboratory mounted rapidly
then i remembered joels last instruction i was nearly
half a minute late i raced into the room and threw
the main switch but the uproar didnt stop i noticed
now that the dying atoms were generating electric cur-
rent and that there was already enough to supply light
for the entire building

  the report which i composed for joel was brief
there wasnt much to write i spent a long time after-
ward lingering and listening but even a miracle will
pall in time and since the set did not need my attention

i	turned to other duties among which was the making
of arrangements for the ceremony to mark the breaking
of ground for the subway

  saturday afternoon joel returned with much clatter
and noise the success of the atomic machine did not
surprise him he listened to my report and agreed with
the entire program i had detailed a gang of workmen
with several of his old type diggers to start the excava-
tion after the ceremony

the metal worms

ta hats right bob he approved well have to

  x use them to sink a shaft to the floor level of the
subway before we can put our new outfit to work he
enjoyed my surprise then walked to the nearest window
what do you think of the new equipment

  there were six cumbersome looking affairs on wide
caterpillar treads adorning our driveway

  they scarcely suggest diggers i replied

  no he answered because theyre really not dig-
gers

he led me out to the lawn for a closer inspection

  these were pushed through the factory rather hur-
riedly he said but then atomic machines will never
be complicated or hard to construct about three weeks
from now if you like you may arrange for a party of
reporters to ride with you on the first passenger coach
to go through the completed tube


amazing stories

  my eyebrows went up and i said something in slang
ten miles of subway in twenty days i added
really thats too much to swallow

  wait and see he retorted smiling they weigh
eighteen tons each he came back to the atomic dig-
gers and they have just a few moving parts one of
these filled with ten buckets of sand our new fuel
would dig a tube three times around the earth i dont
intend to build any more of these the plans are
already burnt too dangerous bob

  i agreed but the machines will be copied un-
less-

  impossible tampering with them will destroy
them as i said these are really not diggers the
earth will be pushed back by the pressure of the ex-
ploding atoms and burned and fused by the terrific heat
the tube will be lined with a shimmering smooth rock-
like fusion of great thickness and strength waterproof
too no brick tile or concrete lining to pay for
what a pipe dream joel i said but my heart
pounded with anticipation

  one atom continued joel unmoved will break
up the next and so on by tapping the surplus power
i confine this spreading destruction within the desired
space each machine will trail a heavy cable and the
extra power produced will be sold until we can use it
ourselves if the cable were to break the free escape
of power would grow and like dynamite would go on
forever finally imperilling the entire planet

  thats not for publication of course

  no but tell the papers the subway will be a half
circle in shape  feet in diameter and the floor 
feet below the street level only one metal worm
the new name for my digger will be used in digging
this tube

  what about the other five

  joel gripped my arm suddenly

  war he whispered its coming bob the
tube were building will hold over two million people
ill dig more tubes the network will make a com-
plete city underground

the underground city

he led me about the lawn i was astonished to
see men stationed on guard in hidden places
i was the object of a machine gun attack
yesterday he said quietly i had a threatening letter
from grubsnig too he knows weve had his micro-
scope in our possession

  did you notify the police

  yes but what can they do

  on monday ground was broken for the subway
when the ceremony was concluded our men swarmed
over the scene the old diggers scooped up the earth
and work was under way

  wednesday morning saw the lowering of the first
atomic machine into the shaft it was started on its
long task how long a task none knew just then we
were hoisted out of the shaft the entrance was covered
except for a small opening through which ran the cable
to carry off the surplus power this cable was to be
unreeled from a giant spool as the metal worm ad-
vanced a group of special police were stationed to
watch the spot though this seemed needless there was
nothing in sight to attract the curious

  despite this trouble did come attacks were made

on the tube the laboring bodies protested the under-
taking of this huge public work without human help
when informed that later thousands of men would be
required the disturbance quieted down no harm was
done but the guards were increased

  the metal worm did well its rumble like that of
an earthquake could be heard faintly above the traffic
its progress was rapid continuous running finished
a mile of subway in the first twenty-four hours and we
were satisfied we werent going to lose on the contract
after all

  meanwhile shafts were sunk on five widely separated
spots one metal worm was placed in each pointed
toward logan square here fueled and started joel
showed me a map of the entire program like spokes
of a gigantic wheel the red lines radiated from the
square to hog island airport chester media via paoli
norristown and langhorne in pennsylvania and to other
towns in new jersey

  this network added joel will drain the most
populous centers around philadelphia

  when the first mile of the main tube had cooled its
equipment was rushed along newspaper scribes from
all over the world were there to write about the wonder
new composition rubber rails for the monorail passenger
coaches girders of rustless steel great slabs of rubber
for paving purposes-for joel was bent on eliminating
all needless noises-and other material was dumped on
the scene as if by magic men worked like sweating
gnomes in the cyclopean cavern under the city streets

  joel and his engineers had decided upon a great deal
in secret our plans are so apart so removed from
present day practices he said that the public must
learn only gradually what we are doing otherwise we
shall be dubbed insane or as visionaries

  his shop sketch showed a real city underground
freight and passenger lines warehouses stores fac-
tories and sewers were confined to the basement floor
three story homes and apartments schools churches
libraries gardens and playgrounds for young and old
were concentrated in the floor above and on the topmost
floor parks open spaces and a clear cold stream for
aquatic sports were to be found all lit by diffused arti-
ficial sunlight making plants grow just as green as on
the surface above

  everything was to be most modern fireproof noise-
less and ideal private vehicles were banned to save
space and maintain the pureness of the air moving
about of people parcels and freight was all to be done by
electric trains conveyors pneumatic tubes moving side-
walks and swift elevators everything was to be elec-
tric in time of war parks and open spaces were to
become intensively cultivated farms

hostile moves

i was lying in bed one morning luxuriously twid-
dling my thumbs in time to the radio setting-up
exercises when my door burst open under the vio-
lent impact of joels body

  its started bob he cried shaking with excite-
ment

  i sat up whats started

  war bob war

i jumped out of bed and reached for my clothes

  the associated press has just sent me a message

over my private wire he said it states  acres
the laughing death



of wheat in the dakotas are being ravaged by hordes
of new insects that fell during the night

  i became calmer

  but-but wheres the war

  oh get that atrophied mind of yours working its
the first move remember those radio messages de-
struction of the world wheat crop then the corn crop
was to be the first threat to civilization

  but joel these insects may be japanese beetles or
something of the sort a perfectly natural occurrence
recorded by history many times before of course i
admit its a coincidence and i went on dressing more
slowly

  let me finish joel tried to hold himself in the
report states further that the farmers found a shower
of cards had fallen with the insects neat cards with
an engraved message on each

  well i asked what was the message

  joel read it off

warning

a new allegiance

world citizenship

call our sons home from
military service

                            serge grubsnig

  the papers were full of it that day because the event
offered new material for the nonsense columns the
afternoon editions however brought out the announce-
ment of a similar event in the far russian wheat lands
public comment assumed a more serious vein obvi-
ously the soviet union was not back of these outrages

  joel and i were rather busy these days what with
checking the metal worms making contracts for sup-
plies rushing hither and yon receiving reporters and
construction engineers and taking care of the other tasks
that come to those at the head of such a project as ours
i was waiting for the philadelphia-new york plane to
empty itself when joel himself climbed out of it nodded
in passing as i climbed in and handed me a slip of paper
keep it he said see me tonight

  the note read 

      my dear dr murch

           you are too late with your atom
           and your subway

                         serge grubsnig

  i saw joel transferring to a washington plane evi-
dently bound south to interview the federal authorities
at the next airport trenton i boarded a return plane
with my plans changed a talk with the police-head fol-
lowed prompt cooperation was given the police short-
wave radio set in motion the machinery of the nations
police forces pictures of the mad scientist were trans-
mitted by telegraph but it soon became evident that
not a single trace of their party whose haunts had
never been well known could be found

  its all in vain joel mourned that evening were
too late hell elude capture he has prepared against
that possibility i was in washington today the
secretary of war was courteous but didnt consider the
matter drastic enough then this press dispatch came in
and now hes worried too

  somewhere out on the grassy planes of brazil thous-
ands of beef cattle were being lost by a malignant dis-
ease that first sent the peaceful steers into mad fits
then dropped them lifeless in their tracks later news

dispatches indicated that cattle were going berserk
elsewhere over the face of the globe wherever beef was
grown on a large scale including our own western
ranches in all of these instances engraved cards were
again found containing the message now familiar to
every one

  its not our burden joel said weve warned the
police its up to them our work lies elsewhere im
changing by plans tonight bob have to the people
must get used to underground life as soon as possible
the tube from media is finished a thousand men are
going below to lay the tracks the main subway from
camden to logan square has its trains and crew ready
well start service tomorrow at a very low fare the
houses and apartments are going up fast a score or
more are already furnished well offer these for lease
for one half surface rents

  he consulted a little pocket notebook

  the atomic machine in the main tube he said will
reach its western terminal point in about an hour the
fuel in the supply chamber was carefully calculated
the machine will stop automatically times precious
we ought to refuel the machine come lets go

at the main shaft

oels tireless vigor carried him on in this fashion
i could but follow

  what about the heat i asked we cant go
in there whileits running

  im going in alone he answered and ive pro-
vided for a way to shield myself from the heat

  at the mouth of the main shaft here in logan square
the special officer in charge was agreeably surprised to
see dr murch

  back so soon sir

  what do you mean so soon i havent been here
since yesterday

  the officer smiled it was a new pleasantry of the
great mans or perhaps it was absent-mindedness or
just a test to try him out he continued to smile in a
reserved way

  i tell you captain gardiner this is my first appear-
ance here today

  but sir you were here just ten minutes ago
ive been away to the capitol retorted joel short-
ly he disliked nit-wits returned a short time ago
flew straight through to pitcairn field at horsham
without stopping off here and there is the windmill
plane in city hall plaza still from which i just
alighted

  this is embarrassing sir the officer replied i
dont know what to say sir

  have you been drinking joel stormed

  no sir the officer was palpibly frightened he
pointed with a shaking finger yu posed right at
that spot in your new heat-proof suit at the request of
the newspaper reporters sir

  theres something wrong here cried joel

  yes sir i think so sir replied the officer then
he spied someone in the passing theatre throngs just
a minute sir and he was off dodging nimbly through
the heavy traffic stream he was back almost at once
with a newspaper man carrying the large characteristic
box camera

   	a form of almost insanity attributed to old time scandinavian warriors

when they fought recklessly for a while and later relapsed into weariness


amazing stories

  i presume joel barked that youre the one for
whom i posed a quarter of an hour ago  yes  well
i didnt get whatever plates you exposed developed
and hustle them promptly to the chief of police ill
meet you there dont linger on the way better still
take the plates right over and have the police develop
them and now captain gardiner turning to the un-
fortunate officer who was he

  sir i do not know the captain stood straight
and stiff as if awaiting a death sentence

  well tell me about him did he look like me
what did he want what did he do dont stand
there wasting my time

  i had never seen joel so angry before overwork
tended to make his temper brittle who knows too
that he didnt suspect the terrible thing that had hap-
pened i think he had caught a flashing glimpse into
the future to which even then i was blind i dont
know he never told me and i never asked

  the officer spoke timidly at first as he went on
however his voice became firmer still i was troubled
by a lost hopeless look in his eyes

  there isnt much to tell sir he said you con-
fided to me yesterday that a heat-proof suit your
engineers were devising was finished and that it had
tested successfully you intimated sir that sometime
this evening the suit would be brought down by some
of your men i was to have it in readiness in the un-
finished passenger station here under our feet you
planned to come here late tonight you said for a trip
to the western end of the tube

  i think joel interrupted we were standing by
that pole where the bus is stopping now

  yes sir the answer was a toneless one

  and there was no one near us

  no one sir-oh yes there was he remembered
it was a newsboy

  joe nodded i wanted to be sure he said a
hunchback rather old for a newsboy sallow face ugly
yes sir

  go on with your story

  i remained on duty this afternoon to receive you
myself the sergeant and i ate supper here together
we were just finishing when an officer in a uniform
similar to that of your personal guards alighted from
the local autogyro plane from willow grove and ac-
costed me with credentials and instructions in your
handwriting

  where are they

  here sir producing them

  joel studied the papers finally he passed hetn to
me

  good forgeries he said go on

  the instructions advised me that you were due for
your intended trip underground at any moment that
you were coming in a private plane and bringing the
suit with you i had the casing over the shaft removed
the elevator brought to the surface and so on a group
of men stood below to render you any help that you
might need i had hardly finished when the one who
resembled you appeared the heat suit concealed him
almost entirely what i did see of his face sir seemed
like yours his aid was carrying a heavy bag of sand
both nodded and the aid said something about your
having decided to refuel and carry on that sounded
natural i went with them in the work-car the leader
couldnt speak on account of the heat suit and the aid

on account of a headpiece and which i presumed he
meant for use in keeping in touch with his superior
they departed promptly by an autogyro plane which had
waited for them on the parkway lawn before the
cathedral  no sir sorry i didnt notice the license
number on the plane

  joel grunted

  is that all sir asked the officer

  yes

  the officer turned smartly with a click of his heels

  sergeant hottinger his voice rang clear take
command and with that he stepped into the work
elevator with not a look behind him

  joel i spoke in a low tone captain gardiners a
clean cut man his profession is his life to him and
he has failed he is hurt his prides down you
know how it is it wasnt his fault anyone might
have been deceived in like manner and you were un-
relenting couldnt we go back-

  joels calmer nature came to the top we both made
for the work elevator ill put him in charge of the
entire job cried joel and then im so very tired
bob

  when we reached the head of the shaft a great
clamor echoed up to us from the black hole captain
gardiner was not in view and the elevator was still in
place

  we found wed been a little late they brought the
officerss body up and we stood with the crowd that
had gathered his profession had indeed been his life
to him without the one the other was worthless

  bob said joel im going home if youre able
find out what it all means and he mingled with the
moving throng and was gone

the unleashed terror

i called sergeant hottinger there are ques-
tions id like to ask i said did those two men
refuel the worm

  they came out without the bag of sand sir he re-
plied its after midnight the worm should have
been done a half hour ago ill call he stepped into
the field office and called the western end of the tube
then beckoned to me and held the earpiece for me i
could hear the muffled roar of operations still going on
the sounds seemed louder than usual they are
the guard agreed the chap at the other end is wor-
ried

  well i said cheerfully dr murch planned to ex-
tend the tube anyway weve been relieved of a hot
task

  but sir may i remind you that the heat suit is gone

  thats so

  well take the wearer into custody sir if he shows
up

  correct by the way do you know what this sur-
plus power cable is for i asked touching it with
my foot

  it draws off the extra power sir if it didnt do
that the worm would sort of run wild set fire to the
ground sir

  any harm in that

  yes sir in time it would spread and destroy every-
thing like dynamite

  whats the speed of the cable

  five feet a minute sir
the laughing death



  i didnt wish to startle him too much captain gar-
diners case was still painfully fresh in my memory

  but i said quietly the cable isnt moving i
laid a restraining hand on his shoulder take things
coolly i advised if the cable is broken it can easily
be mended

  not so easily sir if the break is near the worm
we havent the heat suit sir

  again he called the western end of the tube when
he returned his face was pale

  sergeant harr reports sir he said that the cable
has been disconnected from the digger

  how did he find that out

  flood lights from the top of the shaft sir the
couplings are lying right at the east side of the shaft
sir that would make it just about the time those two
went down sir

  my worst fears were realized the metal worm had
been unleashed i repeated my misgivings to the police
head but such matters were beyond him the report-
ers pictures had revealed nothing of value fliers were
sent out for the hunchback of whom joel had given such
an apt description eventually the hunchback was
dragged into one of the local police stations but before
any facts could be extracted from him he had passed
out from a self-administered dose of poison

  with joel unwell and secluded in his quarters the
storm of detail again centered about me for hours
i sat beside the telephone police on their beat called
me frequently complaints were coming in that sleep
was impossible in west philadelphia windows rattled
in their frames lights flickered the very house founda-
tions trembled the collapse of a row of old houses
added to the din what was about to happen

  toward dawn i found an engraved card on my desk
how it got there i dont know i must have dozed
it was from the mad scientist and at the bottom an
extra line had been scrawled in a heavy hand its
message was short

    apologies for letting your machine run wild
  but i did not know how to destroy it

  what an ironic sense of humor i thought and
sent the card to police headquarters the handwriting
might help

new evils

in the morning such tubes as were ready were
opened for service by noon i was convinced a
half million people would patronize our lines that
day i rode in the first coach to seventy-fifth street
where the last mile of rails were actually just being set
beyond was the extension of the tube which the run-
away worm was digging the tube was being gradu-
ally enlarged the floor was dropping down the side
walls were receding and the arched ceiling was rising
higher where would this end

  the new underground ways were immensely popu-
lar especially with shoppers a spell of hot humid
weather was driving many more under in the very
first hour after the opening one of the houses had been
leased to a writer desiring quiet by the end of the
day fifteen had been hired all under the delaware
river people were taken with the novelty of it

  meeting the chief housing engineer at the paoli divi-
sion i was informed that the schedule had jumped to
 completed houses per day i ordered the hiring

 of more men i wasnt satisfied the rail manager
 announced that the pennsylvania was building shuttle
lines to connect with our tubes

   well i quite astonished him whats the matter
 with the reading  go after it too

   the opening of a subway was no longer an event
 as fast as mileage was laid it was thrown open to
 service money poured in surface traction companies
 started litigation but our legal staff interposed obstacles
 and delays the state governor helped in this matters
 shaped up well i finished my tour and flew back to
 police headquarters for the latest news

   i found the devastation of the wheat lands was
 spreading cattle were still being decimated and food
 prices were soaring a new threat had appeared sud-
 denly the farmers greatest enemy broke all bounds
 here there everywhere a strange shaggy weed grew
 like wildfire choking out all useful vegetation and
 wherever this seemed to have had its start the usual
 cards were found no one could suggest a means to
 combat this latest invasion

   this war of yours the police chief remarked is
 a devilish queer kind of war when will the people be
 attacked directly

    as if in answer the police clerk came in with a cable
 fronlondon the news had been repressed for some
 time but finally it had leaked out the english parlia-
 ment had been in the midst of a night session voting
 on the appropriation of thirty million pounds for the
 construction of a new naval program the vote was
 never completed there wasnt a soul who could after-
 ward render a coherent account of the incident an
 invisible pall had settled over the houses of parliament
 over the grounds nearby and over the thames lords
 commoners boatmen vagrants guards had succumbed

    the victims of this silent attack came to life again
 but england was confronted with the strangest problem
 in the history of any nation it was suddenly bereft
 of its law-making bodies it was without its legislative
 head the speakers of the two houses awoke and stared
 vacantly at the engraved cards that had come mysteri-
 ously into their hands the private asylums of the
 country were quickly requisitioned to receive the af-
 flicted from street sweeper to lord memory had de-
 serted them the past with its burdens and its prob-
 lems was forever the past for them they were as
 children in mens bodies

   the political malcontents surged into london and
 seized control chaos reigned the british army and
 navy were slashed in half enlistments stopped

    some thousands of miles away the united states cav-
 alry had been trekking painfully in a practice march
 across the deserts north of the rio grande and making as
 good time as could be expected in the deep and yielding
 sand when a like fate overtook them an air squadron
 sent out to pick up the men wandering about dazedly
 over the sandy wastes was itself brought down by the
 same evil vapor

   a mexican revolution was nipped in the bud in the
 same manner then london received a second visita-
 tion in the midst of wild celebration and while a red
 army was being mobilized on the spot the pall descend-
 ed and blotted out the past for them all

   and so it went on this tale of vengeance from the
 air in india punitive forces in a salt riot were over-
 taken by the deadly wave a secret army forming in
 japan abandoned its objective elsewhere a vast throng


amazing stories

honoring a modern caesar and his dreams of empire
were scattered like lost children in a short number of 
days the worlds armed forces had been reduced to a
shadow of their former strength

numbered days

these occurrences were far from our city joel
about again accepted each outrage stoically and
plunged once more into the worry we shared
equally every other problem the tubes housing heat-
ing transportation etc had been handed over to our
growing staff of engineers people were moving into
the new homes slowly but when the dreaded gas cloak
feared more than death at last found out our city and
settled upon a patriotic parade on broad street making
several thousand its victims the whole city and the citys
business made a mad rush to get underground where
good weather and safety prevailed at all times

  freed of all other duties we lived practically in the
air flying back and forth from the laboratory to the
western end of the main tube here the fiery terror
was boring through the bowels of the earth with fiend-
ish haste during the first day of its freedom the dig-
ger behaved normally cutting but one mile of tube
we still worried however

  if said joel that machine has been fueled to
capacity it will run on like that for  years

  it would be the eighth wonder i answered a sub-
way three times around the earth

  on the second day the metal worm had cut three
miles instead of one on the third it had reached six
miles on the fourth day ten miles on the fifth day it
was at downingtown fifteen miles away

  the city mayor joel and i were together when the
surveyors brought in the last report our faces were
blanched with fear we spoke in whispers without
knowing it joels hand trembled as he made substitu-
tions in an equation when the answer was ready he
faltered

  utterly impossible he said at last fantastic it
cant be our days would be numbered

  we studied his calculations and found them to be
correct

  youre meddling with celestial forces now i
warned nothing is impossible and think what this
means no matter how much or how fast the worm
plunges onward its energy will not be exhausted as
you said for nearly two centuries however we dont
have to worry about that distant date and i laughed
shortly at last id caught an inkling of the end

  the mayor didnt understand

  is it really true he asked joel will it really
have dug its way to the west coast in a month
and-

  im afraid so bobs right my fear wouldnt let
me admit it the worm is using no extra fuel its a
spreading action faster and faster every day said joel

  gentlemen the mayor spoke with decision theres
just one thing left to do well have to stop that
machine somehow

  it was joel who laughed this time

  cant be done he replied its forever beyond
human control my heat suits gone and with it the
possibility of making another

  what could we do wait wait and hope

on the sixth day the tireless monster was at lan-

caster on the seventh striking to the south a tfifle it
passed through york destroying a mile of city streets
and buildings at this point the subway had emerged
as an open cut the terrific heat thus liberated at-
tacked everything in its way burning farm crops virgin
forests and such structures as happened to be in its path
roaring infernos trailed its progress through valley
mountain and plain it had long since ceased its use-
fulness its path was- a barren waste a searing gash
across the land airplanes flew ahead warning the
people and thus lives and some property were saved

  we no longer journeyed to the tubes end such
trips were useless now even dangerous to us there
were those who held us to blame for having loosed this
fearful menace i began to wish id never taken up
with joels experiments

  by this time the worm had ripped its way through
several mountain ranges and was heading through west-
ern maryland panic seized the people and the press
demanded more information from us

  joel strode up and down the length of our den in a
mounting frenzy of fear and foreboding

  well have to tell them he groaned what will
happen after that-

  he shrugged his shoulders as the door opened to
admit the representatives of the press they saw by
his face that the tidings would be of the worst

  boys he said use your judgment think of the
results

  some fools one of the reporters spoke are going
about making wild statements that the days of the earth
are numbered if-

  joel held up his hand they are numbered though
none can tell the number he passed his sheet of
calculations over for their enlightenment in less than
two months as you can see by the figures the metal
worm will have gone around the world and further
by that time the gash will be over seven miles wide
over three and a half deep it will swallow whole cities
and towns he strode away from them heaping low
curses upon the one who had launched this remorseless
weapon against our planet

  but another said what will happen when the
worm reaches the pacific

  joel waved his hands in despair

  how do i know if you expect the ocean to ex-
tinguish that digger as it would a fire itll probably not
do it remember what happened to the susquehanna 

  the river had been drained and the water had van-
ished in vast clouds of steam the susquehanna valley
seemed doomed

 you must have an idea dr murch a rough
idea-

  look at your figures again joel interrupted
three months four or five and the earth will have
disappeared its like cutting an endless peel from an
apple-the worm will finally lunge into space after it
is through with the earth and were not concerned with
what happens after that

  think joe begged the deepest man has ever
penetrated the earth is less than a pin scratch on this
sphere pointing to the globe in one corner he has
released heat steam gas and death what will happen
in three months when the worm will be digging many
miles into the earth or even before that in case it
suddenly changes its direction and dives downward to-
ward the very core of our planet you rrtay expect
the laughing death



upheavals earthquakes such as man never experienced
before volcanic eruptions tidal waves storms-oh i
havent the words and he plunged out into the labora-
tory and resumed his tramping

  gentlemen i said seeing the reporters to the door
the earth may still exist two or three months from
now but well not be around to witness the fact

joel acts

it was at this time that an american physician found
a cure for the effects of the vapor that made im-
beciles of men but the task of curing the afflicted
promised to be interminable-there were so many new
cases finally the more powerful nations mobilized
such military forces as still remained and with these
strove to cut off the sources of certain chemicals in this
way hoping to thwart the enemy in his manufacture of
poison gases a division of american infantry as-
sembling at camp dix new jersey for this purpose
was attacked on the second night by a new menace a
greenish cloud that sank and clung to the ground that
night  men started to laugh as men had never
laughed before it must have been a ghastly sight
even in death from exhaustion which followed this
insane mirth contorted the facial muscles into horrible
masks the same green vapor visited the other nations
and a great shudder ran through the world men
shunned military service military discipline melted
foreign engineers inspected our underground city
returned to their homelands and began projects of their
own much much smaller and by the old tedious and
expensive methods

  theirs is a vain task i commented they need
help why couldnt we build a few more atomic
machines joel

  he started up from his desk where he had been
brooding he was almost angry-and scared i knew
at once that we would build no more worms

  my question stirred joel to unexpected action to-
day as i write this tale i feel my burden lightened a
little for having been the indirect cause of this that
very day orders were issued for the sealing in of the
metal worms forever each in a structure with walls
many feet thick mighty towers were erected and re-
enforced against earth tremors a large fuel chamber
had been added to each worm to hold many tons of
sand the rocket tubes were closed and the machines
became power producing units instead of diggers

  that settles that sighed joel human hands will
never touch those machines again power will come
from them transmitted through the air for thousands
of years for eternity as far as were concerned some
day during the coming ages man if one of his type is
left will need it

  it was a prophetic utterance and today i live to real-
ize it in time it may prove our salvation this power
coming from the air

  the papers came out suddenly in special editions
over the entire face of the earth the reporters had
decided page after page was devoted to joels predic-
tions and to such news of mankinds suffering that came
of the war of one man against the world strangely
no authority no university no government doubted the
outcome

  panic and resignation reigned side by side public
and private business dwindled transportation was dis-

rupted food supplies were delayed people starved
pestilence was eating away resistance destroying
courage changing men into savages wanting to live a
whole life in the despairing weeks that were left

  the metal worm had plunged down into the earth
near the mississippi in new mexico it had emerged
only to disappear again under the western mountain
ranges railroads highways communities were divided
forever by an unnatural canyon that grew ever deeper
and wider

  the passage of the worm under the bed of the pa-
cific was the forerunner of disastrous earth disturb-
ances california was rocked by a quake cities fell in
ruins and millions of their citizens died in the lower
peninsula tidal waves swept over the narrow strip of
land and carried away the flimsy evidence of human
habitation pilots of trans-pacific air liners veered
from their usual lanes to avoid the sheer banks of steam
that the ocean spumed up later a wild call for help
by wireless from honolulu a vain heart-rending call
was silenced as the sea opened up and sucked in that
city and the whole island group

in person

the mourning nations had been put on a war-
time ration to ward off immediate starvation
joel and i had not the desire to eat even the
sketchy meals allowed us the sound of hideous laugh-
ter the groans of the dying the prayers of the hungry
were always with us the point of living was out of our
lives we strove we gave we planned but our efforts
were slowing down the world was falling away be-
fore us

  sweeping across the pacific through asia and then
europe the metal monster we had so proudly created
left a trail the horror of which man could never sur-
vive in consternation i saw a similarity between the
trembling and shaking of our earth with the shudder-
ing of that atom world we had viewed through the eye-
piece of the microscope like that atom world our
planet too was doomed

  navigation of the atlantic and tributary waters had
stopped the ocean boiled in mad frothing flinging
the scalding waters high in the humid air frogs of
superheated steam rolled over land and water the
new atlantis the floating airport city midway between
europe and america fell drawn in by a maelstrom of
furious waters the sea along the new jersey coast
seethed in rising heat the metal worm was coming
back

  were going backward said joel backward to
the age of steaming swamps a slimy world of scorch-
ing heat torrential downpours and everlasting fogs

  the thermometer was registering a torrid suffocating
fierceness that parched our throats our windows
were wide open upon city hall plaza but only a faint
enervating stirring of air came in the fevered breathing
of a dying planet

  i was growing impatient we had been summoned
to our central city office with a promise that was the
best bait in the world for us wed have come in
response to it if it had been the last earthly act per-
mitted us

  were to hear word from this madman grubsnig
i murmured i wonder-

it would be some amateur detective like as not


amazing stories

joel broke in with a despondency nothing could shake

  there was a map on the wall before us on which
i had traced the course of the metal worm over the
continents and oceans i studied the colored beaded
heads of the pins i had used to indicate it in sudden
interest

  joel i burst out did you notice this

  his weary eyes followed my fingers a quick light
gleamed in his thin cadaverous face his worn frame
lost some of its stoop

  hours perhaps minutes he muttered it will
soon be over

  it has circled the globe i cried not hearing him
listen do you hear i rose and rushed to the
nearest window almost like an echo to my words a
heavy roar shattered the quiet of usual sounds build-
ings were twjsted and turned in grotesque ways and
toppling over and the streets were falling inward out
of sight a broad crevasse had opened across the city
revealing the cavern that was our underground city with
its crowded millions there was a vast spread of flame
as the metal worm flashed by somewhere in the depths
our building quaked and swayed and the heat was in-
sufferable i closed the windows hastily

  its following its original gash i shouted above the
din like a knife cutting-cutting a ball of cheese
its the end

  i sprang to the door responding to a natural impulse
to flee and die some place else but joels claw-like fingers
reached out and held me

  yes bob he said perhaps the earth will be rent
and smashed into a thousand pieces into cosmic dust
but bob were going to stay we have a duty here
unless of course you dont want to-

  i calmed down and eased myself gently into the hot
leather of the nearest chair joel smiled a wan friendly
smile

  i knew you wouldnt leave me bob he said

  perspiration oozed from our faces our handker-
chiefs were already wet but we went on using them with-
out being aware of the fact we gulped several glasses
of ice water that gave a temporary relief i glanced
at the clock we had been waiting for nearly a half
hour

  perhaps it was just a joke a hoax our being called
here i muttered torn between the desire to stay with
joel and an equally powerful urge to escape this tower-
ing pile of concrete and steel that teetered creakingly
back and forth on its foundation we were alone in
the building and that did not add to my courage it
was at this time i think that my hair began turning
gray

  well wait a few minutes more bob joel answered
his eyes on the far horizon where billows of jet black
rolled across the face of the sun lately the sun had
been a rare and pale spectacle appearing fleetingly amid
the dank clouds of steam

  there was a movement in the room behind us then
a sharp intake of breath we squirmed around in our
seats my trousers clung stickingly to the leather
cushion perspiration was in my eyes and it trickled
down the bridge of my nose a wild oath from joels
tight lips his eyes were blazing my lips mumbled
something and heavy throbbing cords were across my
throbbing forehead i spat viciously i wanted to bite
strangle kill

  a taunting laugh mocked our efforts to free ourselves

i choked trying not to inhale the strange odor that
filled the room finally i fell back supinely into my
chair my limbs were leaden and hard to move but
my mind was awake jubilant ferocious joel turned
his head lazily in my direction and i saw that his face
was lit with unholy glee at last at last  his
bulging eyes seemed to cry out to me

  before us stood the madman grubsnig his face
was set his eyes burned with insanity

  sorry to have kept you waiting dr murch-and
you looking at me but time after all is nothing to
us no dont try to speak your tongues are swollen
his voice rasped sharper and i thought we faced death
in a new form at that moment you have upset my
plans my world empire is falling about my ears
your atomic machine was more effective than i gave
it credit for but it must not be forgotten that you de-
signed it now any time any minute the end will
come and you have done this to me

  he stood near the electric fan and held a metal con-
tainer behind the moving blades the stream of scented
air swept past us and out into the hall to which the door
was ajar wild ideas ran through my head if we
could dislodge the fan kick that metal thing from his
hands make him forget himself joel had the same
thoughts his eyes were challenging the fiend

  rave rave as i did gnashed the latter its
just as well that matters have come to the pass they have
the human race was not worth saving its a petty
disgusting manifestation it must have its little schemes
its boundaries its soldiers and its wars

  for a moment he rocked on the balls of his feet and
i thought his fumes had got to him

  my world empire is not to be he went on the
good that i wanted to do will never be done and
your machine has wrecked everything let me assure
you that my revenge will be sweet i shall still have an
empire and with you as my subjects think of it-
just you and i here alone and hating one another on
whatever part of the earth that is left hating one
another until life ebbs away from your tortured bodies
and if we are to die now in this cataclysm well die
together still hating and hating our blood turning into
wormwood in our veins our hearts shriveling with the
venomous malignant disease

  im leaving little to chance thousands of my ships
are rocking the earth with delirious mirth millions
are laughing my men started from the north polar
regions and are reaching southward dropping their
bombs any who escape will die later of the pestilence
the seeds of which have been sowed so well in what
rivers are left when their work is done my men will
pass out too for unknown to them i have inoculated
them with a special virus

  ah you are warm and you want to talk that will
be music to my ears he adjusted something on his
gas tank drink your limbs will be lighter and talk
for your tongues will become normal

  fervently we drank the ice water at hand we could
move sluggishly with great labor-but we could move

  false hopes our captor taunted us you are still
helpless look through the windows this show is
specially for you the world knows its doom while
you have waited here the news has gone forth look
like scurrying rats they go

  his voice boomed on our hot aching eyes took in
the confusion below pride swelled up in me even in
the laughing death



this the last day men were not thinking of self great
timbers were being slung over the crevice that had been
the main subway precarious bridges were being hur-
riedly constructed that the milling mass of humanity
might surge over flame smoke and steam and escape to
the south forever to the south away from that horrible
dementing convulsive gayety that swept down from
the north away from the long green streamers of gas
that reached here there everywhere

  above the rumble of the earth was the drone of many
ships in the air drawn as if by some gigantic magnet
all in one direction as hour after hour we sat through
that heat-steeped afternoon this drone swelled in volume
until the very floor under our feet took on a new vibra-
tion our building still held as it swayed as if by a
breeze and the maddened hordes which now fought
their way over the great bridges still springing up
throughout the city as they were elsewhere wherever
the crack in the earth was not too wide surged in a
wide cirde about the base of our concrete pile-as if
one kind of death mattered much now from any other

  as dusk settled down there was no let-up in the heat
the sky flared with reds and oranges and in the light
of the fires humanity still struggled onward in all kinds
of conveyances in the air on the ground and on foot
other races than the white began to appear blacks
spaniards indians orientals a free mingling of the
races of the earth all urged by the same desire all equal
for the time being elsewhere on the face of the globe
the gap was too wide only here had fate left a means
of escape and before our eyes the peoples of the north-
ern half of the planet were pouring like tumultuous
waters into the southern half whole tribes and bands
and caravans marched parallel to the unnatural canyon
seeking a crossing and finding it here at last

  the night wore on tediously the hours were eter-
nities we sat and sat now silent now ranting and
raving but the long vigil was beginning to tell on joel
his storm of searing words was ebbing lower like
mummies we sat and only when the hot breath of the
night brought up new sounds new earth tremors did
we stir once a dark blot of humanity had stormed
the nearest bridge in numbers too great for the frail
structure and with loud wild laughter the squirming
mass had dropped from view

  toward dawn i noticed joel slyly closing and opening
his hands one finger at a time then moving his feet
turning his head rather aimlessly but all very carefully
at the same time i sniffed the air from the fan a
thrill ran through me the air was but faintly scented
had grubsnig left something to chance after all in
a few minutes i was convinced of this i could scarcely
restrain my elation i let my head drop sleepily to
hide the fact of my discovery

  joels head too was sunken on his chest and now
guttural oaths issued from his lips in the midst of
them i caught his wink my lips moved soundlessly
mouthing the words one two-

  on the third count like wild cats we sprang at our
enemy the ice cooler toppled over and we were
sprawling over a piece of furniture that had been kicked
in our way fear had subdued the insane light in
grubsnigs eyes he flung away the useless gas tank
flung it at my head it struck me drew blood but did
not stop me i wrapped my arms about his legs joel
was back of me he beat my back with clenched fists
with a mad desire to get at grubsnig himself

  we lurched fell were up then down again now in a
meaningless confusion of arms and legs other fur-
niture crashed to the floor to us the world has ceased
to be we were ak-ne our panting and heaving punc-
tuated the struggle joel cried and pleaded leave-
leave him to me over and over again but i would have
killed grubsnig would have trampled upon him but
with a grasp of pain i let go and fell away joel seized
the whirling fan and cast it away from us it had
fallen on us during the mad scramble

  our quarry however was gone down the length
of the silent halls we pursued him leaving a trail of
red at the stairway the chase moved upward on
the roof lit by the surrounding fires a windmill plane
was standing its engine purring silently its windmill
blades moving slowly in the air stream from the pro-
peller

  head him off i cried to joel my voice was
hoarse i dont thinlc he heard me

  the plane was rising vertically from the roof i
sprang upward caught one of the landing wheels and
saw that joel was hanging on by one leg and one arm
from the other

  good-bye bob in case- he called to me and a
lump formed in my throat as i returned the salutation

  the plane was in swift flight we hurtled through
the black smoke but something was wrong for the ship
seemed to be circling endlessly amid the droning shapes
that churned by us in the jet fog

  a heavily laden passenger plane bore down upon us
suddenly from the north i closed my eyes in horror
and it passed amid a crashing of wings and a burst of
flame

  we began to sink hurtling down ever down toward
the crowds below faster and faster until the giant plane-
parachute opened at last and stayed the downward
plunge of the flaming torch to which we clung like
stamping cattle the crying groaning hordes swept by
us as we landed

  joel fell near me but on the shoulders of a densely
packed group and i saw him carried away kicking and
struggling toward a raw wooden arch over the crevice
nothing but death could stop that crowd as i came
down myself millions of feet were stamping the earth
around me and i expected to be crushed at any moment
-but i didnt pause painfully i crawled toward the
burning wreck through the forest of legs i did not
mind the kicks and blows the sweat and blood in my
mouth i had but one aim in life i had to find grubs-
nig and balance the books before i too should pass out

  and then there came a loud rush of tearing driving
wind that tore the clothes from my back a screeching
and a roaring flames all about me a terrible rending
sound the thunder of a million express trains as the
southern half of the earth shot out into space jagged
and bleeding and burning sudden pain consuming kill-
ing pain and then my eyes closed in god-sent un-
consciousness   

  my fingers are tired from gripping my pen and im
warm from having lived over again that dreadful experi-
ence tired and hungry i welcomed the summons
from one of my wives who stands behind me in the
wide stone portal and urges me to hurry as my family
are gathered about the board and waiting for me

but i do not go in at once darkness has settled
over our part of the planet though i know that over

      ri he spectroscope with its glass prisms has analyzed the material constituents
      j- of sun and stars has told of their motions for years glass lenses have given
      us the life history of microscopic creatures and of distant orbs in the heavens
      wotiderful things can be done with glass as witness what the hero of this short
      story gem performs the author introduces a completely new field of investi-
      gation for the enterprising detective science enters more and more in the
      detectives successful solution of problems these new wrinkles are surprising

      but not impossible

a s professor brainard sat before his desk
 he clenched the latest edition of the scientific
i  universe savagely between his hands as
i  though he longed to feel a human throat
there instead of the insensate paper his
eyes were staring so that a ring of white showed
around each dilated pupil his fingers tipped with
ragged neglected nails were trembling with righteous
indignation

  willis was attacking him again-willis who seemed
only to live for the opportunity of publishing some-
thing satirical and stinging iii the journal that should
make the rest of the research world look up and laugh

  he opened the pamphlet again and read some of wil-
lis shrewish article

  the latest theory of light refraction advanced by one
of our number is almost as fantastic as his less recent
ideas on molecular activity geometry is one of the
oldest of intellectual pursuits and the supposition that
new properties might be discovered in the relations of
curves and angles-unless one enters the impossible
realm of the fourth dimension-is hardly cred-
ible 

  the sober looking journal shook in brainards hands
the fool he exclaimed aloud the shallow cock-
sure fool and how does he know but what i have
discovered the secret of the fourth dimension

  the words of the article recaptured his attention
we can only ask again for mechanical proof it ran on
as though answering him audibly it would be easy
for our distinguished fellow research worker to sub-
stantiate his claim by having a sheet of glass ground

to his mysterious formula since he will not do this
we can only conclude that although once a brilliant
physicist he has lived and worked too long alone
and has let his mind stray over the line of the real and
into the territory of the unreal 

  that was willis-the most bitter and virulent con-
tributor of all the group who kept the scientific uni-
verse alive and who too often squabbled and threw
rhetorical mud like children but this time he had
stung too hard that insinuation of unsound men-
tality was not to be borne

  brainard threw the paper to the floor and stamped
on it as though it could be hurt by his heels tiny
flecks of white appeared on his lips senselessly he
caught up a heavy glass ink well and threw it against
the wall in front of him it fell to the floor with one
edge chipped off leaving an irregular splotch of ink
and a jagged dent in the plaster between the two front
windows as testimony to his insane violence of tem-
per

  glaring at the cube of glass on the floor he gradu-
ally resumed dpntrol of himself though his rage was
no less intense for being colder and more cunning a
speculative look appeared in his eyes and again he
pounded on the desk top at slow intervals as though
keeping time with his fist to the strain of some persist-
ent thought

  at last still staring abstractedly at the glass ink-
well he smiled it was not a pleasant smile

  so he wants proof he said aloud he wants
proof this man who as good as calls me insane well
-hell have it

 and now apparently without the touch of
 a human hand the lid was raised    a
 man scrambled from the box his clothes
 smouldering and his face purple from
 strangulation   




amazing stories

  he swung around to face the acid stained desk and
delved among the litter there for a pad of paper and
a pencil for the rest of the morning through lunch
hour and late into the afternoon he worked in blind
concentration filling sheet after sheet with angles and
curves and parades of algebraic symbols now and
then he glanced at a typewritten slip on which were
cabalistic looking equations these were woven in with
other equations and geometric designs until at length
he seemed satisfied

  the tangled results of his figuring were swept into an
untidy pile on his desk and he grudgingly left his task
for a few moments while he went downstairs to the
dinner his housekeeper had prepared as soon as pos-
sible he returned and with square and drawing instru-
ments began to concentrate in one design the sum of
all the scribbled sheets

  a geometric figure gradually emerged-a thing of
flat curves and shallow angles through and across which
marched rows and rows of fractional dimensions that
would guide workmen in duplicating in glass the abstract
thought of a mathematical mind the light of dawn
was just appearing when the drawing was finished and
with a sigh he leaned back in his chair and snatched
a few hours of cramped sleep

  immediately after waking he took his drawing to the
offices of the largest lens and optical factory in the
city and spent the morning explaining the intricacies
of the object he wanted ground to specification then
with crafty precaution that no one group should have
complete knowledge of his discovery he went to a rival
lens company with the precious typewritten slip con-
taining his original equations here too hours were
needed for a full explanation of the thing he wanted
made-a sheet of glss about the size of a dinner plate
but of irregular outline and uneven thickness

  returning home he muttered aloud to himself of the
proof that willis was soon to have and at the sound
of his voice and the look in his staring eyes people
moved away from him in the streets and turned to gaze
after him as he passed

professor willis had his laboratory in the
far end of a great storage yard owned by the in-
dustrial company that retained his scientific services
the yard was surrounded by a ten-foot fence capped
with strands of barbed wire two watchmen went their
rounds every night to guard the merchandise piled over
the ground and every precaution was taken to make
sure that no one entered who had no business there

  nevertheless on a starless night about two months
after brainard had given his two curious orders to the
glass factories willis laboratory caught fire and burned
to the ground

  willis was frantic in the midst of an important and
engaging experiment on molecular disintegration he
was barred indefinitely from further work all his
equipment was warped or cracked by the heat of the
fire and to replace it would be a matter of weeks
furthermore he knew of no other laboratory outfitted
for his needs-but one that was owned by a man from
whom he hesitated to ask favors-a man whom he was
uncomfortably aware of having attacked vindictively
in a late scientific article

  but next morning while he was brooding impatiently
over his ill fortune his phone rang and a solution was
offered to him

  willis came the harsh voice of his rival brain-
ard hear you had a fire last night a pause i
called you up to say that im going away for a month
on a vacation and you can use my laboratory for your
molecular work if you want to its got all the stuff
you need and no one will bother you  

  willis chewed on the end of his cigar he was very
much averse to taking favors from this man not only
did he dislike him but also he feared him lately
there had been a disquieting look in the fellows eyes
when they rested on him

  however if he were to be away for a month it
would be a waste of opportunity not to use his equip-
ment he accepted thanking his rival rather awk-
wardly the illogical apprehensions that set him to
wondering at the unexpected generosity-the unreason-
able suspicions that some motive lay behind the invita-
tion-were dismissed and he prepared to gather up the
few effects spared him by the fire

  brainard at the other end of the line hung up the
receiver and rose wearily from his chair his clothes
were muddy and torn and on the back of one hand
there was a long scratch that might have been caused
by the barbed wire of a storage yard fence but his
lips were shaped to a smile as if at the thought of
some plan that was developing to his entire satisfaction

  willis dreaded meeting his host as he came over that
evening to install himself in the borrowed laboratory
but his nervousness was comfortably dissipated by the
fact that brainard had already gone leaving a curt note
of welcome and a set of duplicate keys with the house-
keeper

  the servant an elderly woman with thin lips and
blurred gray eyes handed over the note and the keys
and prepared to leave she too was taking a vacation
while her employer was away willis would be abso-
lutely alone in the big house half of which was brain-
ards workshop

  he had planned after a casual look at the laboratory
to go back to his own home and return in the morning
but this he found himself unable to do for tempt-
ingly laid out as punctiliously as though arranged by his
own hand were all the instruments he needed for the
continuation of his experiments brainard must have
kept up with his activities astoundingly to have dupli-
cated his equipment at such short notice

  a touch led to a little more precise arranging which
in its turn drew him into the beginning of one of those
heedless spells of concentration that had preceded many
a night of work soon he was moving swiftly about
the chamber oblivious to time and all else but the array
before him

  just once he was momentarily interrupted a slight
scraping noise came to his ears confused by the effort
of tearing his attention away from his work he glanced
around the room there was nothing unusual to be
seen

  striding to the door he locked it and slipped into
place a heavy bolt that worked from the inside only
then he fastened the front windows securely and re-
turned to the long table sure that there was no way 
in which he could be interrupted the vague fear of
brainard that had been awakened again at the sound
of the odd noise was submerged in the fascination of
his experiment

  on and on he worked over the task that would never
be completed by his hand time was lost and it might
hidden in the glass



have been moments or hours later when he half turned
-to see something behind him that brought a startled
shout to his lips

  the cry was cut off like a slashed cord as something
crashed down on his head

the sole witness in the investigation of the murder
of professor willis was unable to recall the exact
hour at which he had heard that muffled cry from behind
the closed windows of the brainard home he only
knew that it was very late at night that he had notified
a policeman at once and that in less than two minutes
they had forced a way in and were exploring the house
no one was found although the witness insisted that he
had heard a slight noise as they approached the door of
the laboratory this however was disregarded after
breaking in the door a thorough search of the big room
proved it to be empty of any living thing

  on the floor was the body of willis and no medical
examination was necessary to tell that he was dead
obviously also he had been murdered but in spite of
the quickness with which they had entered there was
nothing to tell where the murderer had gone or how
he had managed to disappear so rapidly

  careful not to touch the body the officer gazed at it
curiously it lay with eyes staring fearfully and head
battered in as though hit by a club near an odd object
that was drawn up next to the wall

  this was a large glass box about six and a half feet
long by four and a half feet square a contrivance that
inexplicably suggested a plate glass coffin a glance
showed that it was empty he could look through it
and see the wall behind as clearly as though gazing
through a freshly polished window

  using the phone on the desk he called headquarters
careful not to leave the room for an instant until an
examination could be held then he settled back in his
chair to wait until blair or some one could come with
the night squad in a short time after he phoned the
squad arrived with blair in charge

  each detective it is said has his own peculiar methods
of solving crime just as artists have their own individual
ways of designing a picture the method of big slow-
going blair was apt to be dangerous to himself in that
he insisted on working absolutely alone in the scene of
violence although in this case certainly no one could
have foreseen danger to the most solitary of investi-
gators 

  he irritably accepted the presence of the coroner till
the body had been examined and removed then he
instructed his men to go over the house and set himself
to the task of searching the laboratory but first he
fastened theshattered door by propping a chair under
the knob to make sure he would be let alone while he
combed over the room for clues

  he read and reread the note from brainard that
accounted for willis presence in another mans house
knowing nothing of any enmity between the two men
he saw in the note and duplicate keys only a hospitable
offer from one scientist to another in time of need

  methodically he began to search the place examina-
tion of the splintered door told him that the room had
been securely locked from the inside by the unfortunate
scientist before he started the midnight experimenting
the windows were also tightly fastened and showed
no signs of having been tampered with the first
mystery to be solved it seemed was how any one could

have entered the room while willis was there at work

  he considered the chance that willis might have
locked himself in with some other person an assistant
perhaps but that was proved impossible by the inside
bolt on the door no one could leave the room and
relock the bolt from the outside this fact also ex-
tinguished the momentary idea that brainard himself
with his own keys could have entered and left the
laboratory that night

  finally dismissing the problem of entrance as some-
thing that might later be solved by carefully sounding
walls and floors for a secret doorway blair set stolidly
to work to examine the contents of the room in search
of any chance hints that might present themselves

  the rows and rows of test tubes drawing instru-
ments and delicate electrical apparatus told him no
story the desk drawers revealed nothing relevant to
the case puzzled he stared absently at the huge glass
box that ranged along one wall beside the dark stain
on the floor where the body had been found

  the box too told no story it was empty as he
looked through it the wall showed clear on the other
side and as he came nearer he could see the floor
through it with equal ease he tried to lift the lid
but as he tugged at it cautiously for fear of somehow
breaking it he found that it did not move this in itself
was mildly perplexing as he could see no evidence of a
lock or catch of any kind in the clear glass front
along the back ran a heavy steel strip which reinforced
its hinges but in the front there was no speck of metal
visible

  the possible purpose of the box was beyond him
perhaps it was designed for some sort of aquarium
though why even the most scientific of fish tanks should
have a lid over it was puzzling looking through it
he observed that there were spaces around the hinge
bolts near the top large enough to admit air in case
the contrivance really was used for an aquarium

  however he could not see that any light was shed
on the murder of professor willis by the presence of
one more strange scientific instrument in a room full
of such things

  shrugging indifferently he turned away from the
empty glass box   

  the next instant he received a smashing blow on the
back of the head and fell in almost the precise spot
where the body of willis had lain before him

at six oclock in the morning the detective rand
hardy was roused from his comfortable bed by
a phone call from headquarters half an hour later the
wispy little man with the graying hair and the peculiar-
ly blue eyes was listening to a tale of two men struck
down in an empty room which in each instance had
been locked from the inside the first professor wil-
lis was dead the second blair was in the hospital
with a fractured skull

  at the end of the short and not very helpful account
of what had happened detective hardy nodded and
went out into the bright morning sunshine his first trip
was to the hospital where he asked to see blair here
he met with no success in his crusade blair did not
recognize him and was weakly delirious babbling sen-
tences poured from his lips ranging from broken
snatches of childhood reminiscence to repetitions of
words uttered the day before

  one occasionally repeated phrase however made


amazing stories

hardy frown attentively this was an unintelligible
reference to a glass box there were no elaborations
on the theme merely the words-the glass box-mur-
mured over and over again

  puffing absently at an unlighted cigarette he left the
hospital and went to the brainard home

  the door was locked both times he asked harris
a younger man dark and taciturn with whom he often
worked

  yes from the inside said harris willis had
fastened it with this bolt you see and blair had propped
a chair under the knob so tightly that we could hardly
force the door open

  youre sure it would have been impossible to get
into the room

  in the ordinary way yes perhaps theres a secret
entrance he shrugged but weve sounded walls and
floor and found no trace of such a thing

  have you any theory at all of what might have
happened 

  harris hesitated well he said finally the house
was entered too soon after the murder of willis for the
murderer to have escaped and the second time a man
was knocked on the head here the building was cov-
ered by half a dozen of the force and no one could
have possibly left the laboratory

  then you think whoever did it is still in the house
hardly that said harris my idea is that willis
and blair werent done in by anything human at all-
by some mechanical thing he pointed to the racks
of apparatus that lined the walls im no scientist so
i dont know the meaning of much of this stuff but
it occurred to me that some one of these things might be
an innocent looking kind of death trap that big glass
box perhaps   

  with the words hardy turned to stare the glass
box he remembered blairs repetition of the phrase
in his delirium

  what do you suppose its for he exclaimed
havent an idea said harris its empty-but
i cant help thinking it has some significance both
men were struck down beside it in the same spot
possibly theres some kind of spring arrangement in
the floor there and when a man stands on it his weight
is enough to release the force  

  have you tried it

  no-o- said harris slowly i havent that would
be a good deal like sitting in an electric chair to see if
the current is turned on

  carefully avoiding the fatal spot in front of the box
hardy walked around it gazing at it intently had
there been any mechanism inside it could have been
plainly seen

  lets test out your concealed spring theory he said
harris started promptly for the spot in front of the
box marked with the dark stains on the floor hardy
caught his arm

  wait a minute young fellow youre married
with a family ill stand there myself-and then if
youre right there wont be any widows and orphans in
this business

  deliberately he walked over the section of the floor
that might cover a deadly concealed spring and waited to
see if he would be the third to fall with a cracked skull

  nothing happened methodically he shifted his
weight from side to side but no ominous unguessable
powers were released

  that seems to rule the box out he said his voice
casual he sat down before the desk and stared at the
open front windows where the sun was streaming in
on the bare wood floor

  after all he said thinking aloud its not likely
that any mechanical force did for willis and blair
thats far-fetched and complicated no i think a
human hand held the club or whatever it may have
been that cracked the heads for them

  but if thats the case protested harris the mur-
derer would still be in the house hes had no time
to escape and all our work has proved that there are
no secret doors or compartments where he could be
hiding

  it does sound improbable murmured the older
man he turned again to gaze at the glass box that
had been mentioned in the delirious babble of the sec-
ond man to be stricken down beside it

  and suddenly as he gazed his eyes took on a colder
blue and his lips shaped themselves to a soundless
whistle for looking through the transparent glass
walls he noticed a curious thing

  the wooden baseboard that surrounded the room
and that presumably extended along the wall behind
the box-could not be seen through the clear glass
it came up to each end of the box and then disappeared

  the obvious conclusion was that able to see through
the box and still unable to see any trace of baseboard-
there was no baseboard there to be seen and as it was
a foot and a half broad if a section of it had been re-
moved it might provide the secret way by which some
one could enter the room in spite of door and window
locks

  help me shift this box away from the wall he said
abruptly to harris i want to look behind it

  the combined efforts of the two men could not move
it an inch panting they gave it up

  call a couple of the boys from downstairs com-
manded hardy but two were not enough two
more had to be summoned and the six of them ranged
themselves at side and ends of the incredibly immov-
able glass box

  it must be fastened to the floor exclaimed harris

  no there it moved a little its just kind of heavy

  it was indeed heavy the six of them were barely
able to slide it a few feet over the creaking protesting
floor boards to a space in front of the sunny windows

  but as the box was moved away from the wall
hardy stared in amazement the baseboard was un-
touched behind it in spite of the fact that he had been
unable to see it through glass as clear as spring water
it was undeniably there and undeniably untampered
with here was no secret way

  completely puzzled he sat at the desk again and
looked at the box in its new place by the window the
sun pouring warmly in bathed it with light and reflected
from bevelled edges in rainbow colored strips it
seemed to mock him empty and innocent appearing

  and then he made another discovery

  about three feet above the lid there was an irregular
splotch of ink and a jagged dent in the plaster of the
wall between the two windows as he looked straight
at the box apparently seeing through its sides he saw
the same irregular ink stain it seemed to be on the
wall directly behind the box instead of a yard above it

  well- breathed hardy

  rising from his chair he walked to the side of the box
hidden in the -glass



gazing down into it he saw the floor but it was not
the floor directly beneath it instead he found himself
staring at the tips of his own shoes a foot and a half
to the side

  while harris watched him wonderingly he walked
around the box gazing through it from different angles

  have you opened this thing he demanded

  why no said harris i tried to and it seemed
fastened somehow so i let it alone no use of opening
it-you can look square through it now

  no corrected hardy you can look through it
all right-but not squarely

  what do you mean chief 

  i mean that when i sit here at the desk and look
through it-i see a patch on the wall three feet above
it and when i look down through the lid-i see the
floor a foot and a half to the side in other words
harris its impossible to see into that box

  but its clear as window glass argued harris

  clearer hardy agreed youd think a speck of
dust could be seen in it but it couldnt be if you found
your glance being deflected off at right angles

  wondering the rest stared at the coffin-like thing that
gleamed in the sun and all saw the same strange
phenomenon at the same instant-a thin wisp of bluish
vapor that began to curl out from the open spaces
around the hinge bolts

  its smoke exclaimed harris sniffing

  from an empty box added another of the men

  but it seemed no longer empty gradually it was
growing opaque so that it was impossible to see through
it the opacity deepened till it appeared suddenly to
have been filled with milk

  and now apparently without the touch of a human
hand the lid was raised it opened as rapidly and
evenly as though worked by some kind of machinery

  a man scrambled from the box his clothes smolder-
ing and his face purple from strangulation and dashed
for the windows he was half out of one of them
before they could reach him a sheet of glass-about
the size of a dinner plate but of uneven thickness and
irregular outline-fell from his hands and smashed to
pieces on the sidewalk below

  it took four of them to subdue and handcuff him
and with one glance at the gibbering thing that had once
been professor brainard hardy picked up the phone
and got in touch with the city asylum

the

t tiding in an empty box exclaimed harris as a
l l little later he and hardy examined it

  the mystery of its weight was revealed at a glance
the top and sides were not ordinary flat sheets of glass
but were shallow triangles each plane of which was
pronouncedly curved at the thickest points the glass
walls were nearly half a foot through rendering the box
enormously heavy this too explained why the lid had
seemed to be fastened down-its sheer weight made it
a difficult task for one man to raise it

  inside the box was a screw jack arrangement so
geared that the lid could be jacked up rapidly and noise-
lessly by any one lying inside

hardy pointed to the curved under surface of the lid
the reason for the smoke he observed we just
happened to put the box in the suns rays and the
curved surface partly focused the heat like a burning
glass it must have been uncomfortable in there

  but-hiding in an apparently empty box marveled
harris again and of course the chances were that no
one would bother to open it when they could see at
once that it was empty so simple   

  simple repeated hardy raising his eyebrows
why yes its just a kind of prism effect the
principle of the periscope you know if you look into
a glass prism your glance is deflected off at an angle
but the sides of this box arent prisms hardy
pointed out if they were-you wouldnt have any
box left youd have a solid cube

  same idea i guess said harris

  in response hardy stepped into the box and lowered
the lid over himself with the jack harris gave a start
of surprise though somewhat distorted by the curved
glass surfaces the body of his chief was visible

  when brainard was in it he was invisible said
hardy after he had clambered out when im in it
i can be clearly seen theres more to this than meets
the eye harris-a few details that ill bet a lot of
scientists would give their ears to know maybe the
answer lies in that sheet of glass he threw out   
puffing absently at a cigarette he pulled the window
shades to cut off the sun lest the box set the wood floor
afire

  oh well whats the difference he said at last
weve got our man lets get some breakfast

  a still unsolved riddle the glass box gleamed blankly
after them as they left the room

fjhen million years hence the sun will be old and climatic conditions and the
j- aspect of the heavens will have changed accordingly many effects will have
to be taken care of it is not absolutely impossible that the nebulas should play
a part in the cosmic changes perhaps some dark nebula will affect the planets

   jaggar ho was scrutinizing carefully the
l scene in the view-plate of the great reflecting
l  telescope of the university of itlantos in
  panenbu the capital city of aerth every
now and then he would glance aside and
taking a silvery stylus in his skinny almost clawlike
hand he would draw queer little symbols and figures on
a pad of white paper on the desk before him there
was a concerned look in his immense eyes and in his
furry though oddly human face there was an expres-
sion which one of his fellow creatures may have inter-
preted as denoting awe or even dread to aggar ho
such emotions were almost impossibilities for eons
his ancestors had been toying with the forces of nature
curbing them according to their needs and desires until
now it would have taken a great danger indeed to
awaken in any member of his race the remotest hint
of fear

  but though the danger which aggar ho read among
the stars may have been colossal enough to make him a
little afraid his keen intellect remained unhampered
if it was within the scope of possibility for him to help
avert any coming calamity certainly no silly emotions
would prevent him from doing so

  to a man of the twentieth century aggar ho would
have seemed to be a creature of a nightmare he wore
only a plain silver diadem to hold his bushy gray hair
in place and a breech cloth of some gray knitted material
about his hips in consequence his peculiar physique
was well revealed except for his chest which housed
his huge lungs and was immense beyond all comparison
with anything human his body was singularly frail
his arms and legs were spindly and attenuated his

feet were flat and large a thick polar fur covered him
from head to foot his ears were very large and bat
like-adapted for hearing in a very rarefied atmosphere
where all sounds are faint his great green eyes had
elongated pupils like those of cats they stared out
from either side of his beak-like nose and made him
look for all the world like a crafty old owl there was
just a hint of fierce determination about them a look
which had survived aggar hos youth plainly the
old scientist belonged to an age far distant from the year
 the appointments of the room-its dials switches
and its single radium lamp over the desk in front of
the telescope and its big crystal dome which trans-
mitted the starlight all proved this

  many strange things had happened to aerth in the
past ten million years in  a d the inhabitants
of mars driven from their native planet by shortage of
air water and sunshine had descended to aerth with
their superior weapons and knowledge they quickly
subdued the aerthians it was from these conquerors
that aggar ho was descended the martians had not
been cruel masters they had ruled aerth wisely and
efficiently for ten million years and had won the admira-
tion and willing co-operation of the natives to whom
they were almost gods the two races always remained
distinct from one another for though inter-marriage
was not uncommon no offspring came from such unions

  as nature had worked on mars so it worked on
aerth the planets water supply slowly seeped into
the rocks far beneath the surface crust or as vapor
leaked away into space until now the oceans had van
ished the atmosphere was gradually dissipated in this
latter fashion until at length it was so rare that a man


 aggar ho and sark ahar walked over to the center
 of the landing stage here supported by a funnel-
 shaped cradle was a big shiny sphere about seventy-
 five feet in diameter there was a row of circular
 windows running horizontally around its circumfer-
 ence four cylindrical objects looking like some kind
 of searchlights were set at equal intervals around its
 lower hemisphere

amazing stories

of the year  would have gasped and died in it in
a few minutes the sun too had grown old its deep
red light shone down upon vast stretches of parched
desert over which every now and then terrific dust
storms raced the sky was always a deep cloud-
less blue in it a few stars twinkled even during
the day except where the thin ribbon-like canals rati
their ruler-edged courses over the face of the planet
bringing water from the melting polar snow-caps every-
thing was dry and devoid of vegetation the summers
were still quite warm but the winters were terrifically
cold

  presently aggar ho reached for a tiny lever at the
side of his desk and swung it from a vertical to a hori-
zontal position the picture in the view-plate before
him faded then he tapped a little brazen gong with
his stylus in a moment in answer to the tinkling sum-
mons another creature entered the room through a
curtained door

  the new arrival was somewhat more human than
aggar ho he was heavier and much better muscled
his chest was large but not so large as the martian
scientists and the white fur on his body was not so long
and thick his eyes were blue there was a twinkle
about them which told plainly that their possessor was
brim full of clever good nature the ancestors of this
man had all been natives of aerth

  well chief he said what news from the stars
has the black nebula come close enough so that we may
pull its tail or has it suddenly vanished altogether
plainly the two men were on the most intimate of terms

  aggar ho looked up at his assistant the grave ex-
pression on his face did not change we can no longer
joke about the black nebula sark ahar my son he
said unless something can be done it will cause all
the inhabitants of aerth to be frozen to death in thirty-
five days

  the glint in the young aerthians eyes grew hard
you have finished your calculations you know that
all this is true he inquired

  there is no chance for a mistake returned aggar
ho here are my figures and he tapped the pad of
paper lying on his desk you may take them to your
work room and check them if you like ever since
we began to watch the black nebula six months ago
i have been afraid we thought that it would miss
the solar system by several billion miles but tonight i
have plotted its course it is going to envelope the sun
and blot out its light and warmth microscopic obser-
vations prove that it is a vast cloud of the heavy opaque
gas number  when it reaches the sun it will form
a dense layer over its surface then there will be
darkness

  you have thought of a way out asked sark ahar

  yes there is atomic energy i have a theory
which with a good deal of careful experimenting may
result in its release with the inexhaustible power
contained in the atoms of all substances at our command
there is no doubt that we could both heat and light our
world very adequately great spheres of white-hot
disintegrating matter supported on towers all along the
courses of the canals would free us forever from de-
pendence on the sun but can we control such a mighty
force once started anywhere on aerth the process
of disintegration would probably continue until the
planet had become a globe of incandescent gas

  we will find a way chief said sark ahar the

space ship was delivered by the fallef company at noon
today it is on the landing stage now are we going

to start the experiment tomorrow

  yes

aggar ho and sark ahar stepped out of the
elevator which had carried them to the landing
platform at the very pinnacle of the highest tower of
the observatory presently they had left the little cupola-
like structure at the top of the shaft the platform was
a flat metallic square about two hundred feet each
way a light icy breeze swept through the morning
sky it blew against the bodies of the two men rump-
ling their silky fur wrappings there was an exhilarat-
ing tang in it the altitude of the tower was fully
two thousand feet and the view from its summit was
magnificent below them toward the west the men
could see the great city of panenbu with its countless
multicolored spires gleaming under the morning sun-
shine the streets were thronged with midgets going
to work-still ignorant of the danger that threatened
them toward the east beginning at the base of the
great observatory building was a strip of cultivated land
about eight miles wide it was faintly green with the
earliest growth of a grass-like cereal called telth for
the water coming down throughout the subterranean
conduits from the melting north polar snows had just
arrived three weeks before

  beyond the band of telth the aerthian wilderness
stretched off to the far horizon except for the count-
less dunes of yellow sand it was almost as flat as a table
top it was the bottom of what had once been the at-
lantic ocean

  everything in view was harshly clear cut even in the
great distance above arched the deep lapis-lazuli dome
of the sky here and there in it a saucy star twinkled

  occasionally a torpedo-shaped aircraft would glide
noiselessly past the tower carrying a group of furry men
to some distant city the sun would glint on its silvery
hull and on the queer numerals mounted on its prow

  aggar ho and sark ahar walked over to the center
of the landing stage here supported by a funnel-
shaped cradle was a big shiny sphere about seventy-five
feet in diameter there was a row of circular windows
running horizontally around its circumference four
cylindrical objects looking like some kind of search-
lights were set at equal intervals around its lower hemis-
phere they pointed slantingly downward at an angle
of forty-five degrees with the platform the globe was
a space-fiier

  aggar ho opened an oval door in the side of the
craft the two men ascended a short flight of metal
steps to the central chamber of the ship the room
which was lighted by port holes set all around its walls
was packed with a bewildering outlay of scientific appa-
ratus at one side before a large window was the pilot
seat and in front of it a number of levers and a board
bearing many dials and instruments it was by means
of these that the flier was controlled the remainder
of the floor space was occupied by machinery and de-
vices and constituted a complete laboratory for explor-
ing the inner secrets of atomic structure in the center
of the room supported by a sort of tripod was a black
object which looked like a big pressure kettle many
cables and wires led to it from a bank of cylindrical
tanks which were filled with a fluid that supplied an elec-
atomic fire



trical circuit of enormous voltage and amperage there
was a work-bench running almost completely around
the walls of the laboratory and on it were ranged many
odd instruments there were queer microscope-like
devices for watching the electrons of atoms rotating in
their orbits there were big glass globes for producing
strange rays there were several electric furnaces
lathes and other machinery for turning out new ap-
paratus whenever it was needed besides there was a
multitude of other things

   aggar ho seated himself in the pilots chair while
 sark ahar stood beside him the old martian shifted
 a little lever on the control-board a low musical hum
 started from somewhere in the hulk of the ship in spite
 of its faintness it was somehow suggestive of an enor-
 mous and mysterious power now the space flier was
 shooting upward it swayed a little the two men felt
 their weight apparently increase just as though they
 were going upward on a fast elevator the four re-
 pulsion-ray projectors mounted on the bottom hemis-
 phere of the craft were sending powerful beams of
 energy downward and were raising the big globe from
 the ground

   details on aerths surface were growing rapidly
 smaller and the field of view was broadening out
 panenbu with its narrow encircling ring of vegetation
 spreading out like a vast disc on the desert was rapidly
 becoming a toy city it seemed to drift toward the west
 for the fliers were hurtling eastward with terrific vel-
 ocity limitless sandy plains were coming into view
 all gleaming and desolate under the morning sunshine
 panenbu disappeared beneath the horizon now and
 then thin ribbons of vegetation running from pole to pole
 would be seen traced like tautly drawn strings across
 the wilderness now aerth looked like a great relief
 map and now it began to take on a slight outward
 curvature the scientist and his subordinate were
 rapidly drawing away from their planet

 that was a fine start chief said sark ahar the
 ship is gaining altitude faster than i ever saw a space
 craft do before at the outset but i suppose you have
 to expect such performance from any new invention of
 the fallefs everything they produce is wonderful

   aggar ho turned toward his young assistant his
 face was screwed up into a grimmace which sark ahar
 recognized as a disdainful smile it was i who in-
 vented the new repulsion-ray concentrator that makes
 the rapid acceleration of this space ship possible i sold
 fallef the rights fallefs bungling assistants certainly
 would never have thought of the idea aggar ho
 paused for a moment finally he said you may
 sleep now sark ahar in four hours i will call you to
 take charge of the craft

   the younger man climbed the spiraling metal star to
 the upper compartment here was a little kitchen a
 room full of supplies and a chamber with four berths
 in it sark ahar tumbled into one and was quickly
 asleep since he had assisted his chief in his work the
 night before he had of course not slept

   aggar ho seated before the control-board watching
 dials meters diminishing aerth and the star-shot sable
 of empty space mused softly he is a fine young
 aerthian sark ahar-a native born of natives and
 yet clever-very clever sometimes i almost think he
 will become a scientist but that would be odd there
 hasnt been a man of great wisdom among their race
 for millions of years they were a great people before

my ancestors came but our superior knowledge robbed
them of all initiative it is too bad

the musical ringing of a little bell at his ear told
sark ahar that his rest period was over he
climbed out of his berth and joined aggar ho he
glanced at a meter on the control board

  thirty thousand miles he read aloud

  yes returned the martian by the time your four
hours on duty is over allowing for acceleration we
should be eighty thousand miles from aerth there
we will stop during our experiment on atomic energy
we will travel in an orbit that distance from the planet
the world council has decreed it they fear that we
may destroy aerth if we work on its surface and well
they may for we are playing with a dangerous thing
call me when it is time good night

  aggar ho retired and the young aerthian took his
place

  sark ahar stared at the star-strewn circle of blackness
before him there was little to do but think for the
controlling of the ship was for him almost automatic
except when now and then a small meteorite struck the
impenetrable force-shield of the craft and made it sway
a little there was no movement

  the death of the world-within a month aggar
ho had predicted it and he sark ahar had checked his
calculations the martian as usual was right they
were wonderful those martians-especially aggar ho
wasnt it he who had engineered the building of the
great than taxa canal running a distance of more than
ten thousand miles over aeaths surface wasnt it
he who had extended mans natural span of life to more
than a thousand years aggar ho was great but here
at last was his defeat what if he did release and con-
trol atomic energy there wouldnt be time to build
the towers and spheres he had talked about like every
man of his race aggar ho had pluck-hed fight against
reason that was just what he was doing now but it
was useless the inhabitants of aerth would freeze to
death unless someone thought of something else hed
have to think but no that wasnt sense

  after an hour or so the moon came along and drifted
into the flock of stars that had been shining at sark
ahar through the observation window it was only a
little more than half illuminated the sun was toward
the left of it and wasnt visible from where the aerthian
sat the satellite seemed a little larger than when
viewed from the planet and its empty plains gleamed
with an almost blinding intensity sark ahar studied
it his keen eyes could even make out a few big
craters it was a funny world-the moon-all jagged
and cut up and deserted sark ahar had been there
twice with his chief clad in oxygen helmet and heavy
armor he had enjoyed wandering through its empty val-
leys and climbing into its lonely craters around tycho
there were the remains of an extensive irrigation system
built by the last of the lunarians to make use of the
almost vanished water supply those moon men had
become extinct before there were human beings on
aerth what good was the moon now it was just a
useless derelict of space desolate and lifeless

  when aggar ho returned from his nap he ordered
his subordinate to shut off the power as he had pre-
dicted the craft was eighty thousand miles from aerth
itsmomentum would of course carry it a little beyond
this point but the gravitational pull of the planet would


amazing stories

drag it back and during the course of the experiment
it would revolve as a little satellite of aerth

  immediately the two men set to work on their seem-
ingly hopeless task the cover was removed from the
great caldron-like furnace and an odd set of metallic
plates was placed inside together with a small quantity
of mercury then the cover was replaced and the air
exhausted from the interior by means of a small electric
pump for a whole day a current with titanic voltage
and strength crackled between the plates aggar ho
and sark ahar wearing thick goggles and hiding behind
lead shields which alone saved their lives from the
dangerous emanations watched the white-hot inferno
through a little quartz window set in the side of the
furnace the whole ship fairly reeked with heat and
the meters registered an enormous consumption of
power finally aggar ho threw the great switches
the light slowly faded from the plates the first at-
tempt had been a failure mercury had refused to give
up its atomic energy

  the plates were changed and another substance was
placed in the furnace-this time silicon another trial
was made-also without any hint of success

  day after day the same soul-searing work went on-
new elements new compounds new plates new voltages
-all to no avail and always that big black cloud of
fate that was going to blot out the sun crept nearer and
nearer the two experimenters watched its progress in
the view-plate of their radio vision instrument the
pictures were radioed direct from the observatory at
panenbu fifteen fourteen thirteen twelve days-
slowly the time of darkness crept closer it was only
the pluck and self-control resulting from ages of scien-
tific race training that kept all aerth from going mad

  there were thousands of scientists working on the
problem of saving aerth and almost all of them sought
the means of doing so in atomic energy none believed
that there was any hope even if the mighty power were
discovered but all kept doggedly on aggar ho and
sark ahar sighted several experimental ships like their
own and they talked to the occupants of over nine
hundred of them by radio never was the slightest hint
of success reported

at last the day when darkness was to fall upon the
 solar system came sark ahar and aggar ho
watched the approach of the shadow through the win-
dows of their ship to a casual observer there would
have been nothing very awful about the thing the
only evidence of its presence was the apparent absence
of stars in a small portion of the heavens gradually
as the cloud crept on other stars were blotted out and
some of these which had been hidden reappeared to all
appearances the blackness was moving with utmost slow-
ness but in reality it was tearing along at a terrific rate
always it crept closer to the sun presently it touched
the edge of the glowing red disc and then for thirty
hours the light of the old luminary was slowly fading
for five hours after that a grayish scarcely visible
luminosity continued to come from it but at last even
that disappeared on aerth the lights of the scattered
cities glowed as patches of dim radiance except for
these the planet was entirely invisible only the icy
stars gleamed on unchanged

  reports of the progress of things on aerth came to
the two experimenters by radio

  sun motors stopped stored power will last for
several days was the first report after the coming of
darkness

  to all appearances there was little panic the people
had shut themselves in their homes and were waiting
resignedly for their end

  almost all the experimenters had given up the quest
and had returned to their native cities aggar ho and
sark ahar were among the few who remained out in
space they were working like two demons just as
they had been working for a month they would have
to give up soon for their supply of power was low

  two days after the coming of the cloud the report
reached the space-ship the atmosphere of the planet
is freezing it is falling like snow in many places
whole communities have been frozen to death the
stored solar energy may keep a few people alive for a
short time but the end cannot be far off

  aggar ho was fruitlessly examining the instruments
over the roaring ray furnace there was a mixture
never before tried between the plates presently he
turned toward the younger man who was standing be-
side him the old martian was slowly shaking his
head sark ahar scrutinized his chief carefully he
could see that his big eyes were watery and blood-shot
and that his rumpled fur looked unusually shabby lack
of sleep and continuous labor had certainly done him no
good

  you had better rest said sark ahar i will watch
the furnace perhaps when you awaken the problem
will be solved

  aggar ho smiled sadly perhaps he said and
then after a pause thank you my boy he tramped
wearily up the spiral stairs his magnetic boots which
served to hold him to the steel floor in the absence of
gravity making a clattering noise

  when he was gone sark ahar took a single perfunc-
tory look at the instruments satisfying himself that
they registered nothing of importance then he went
over to the pilot seat at the side of the chamber and sat
down on it he turned it around on its swivel so that
he could look toward the experimental apparatus

  sark ahar was extremely tired but still he musnt
sleep he must watch for results-results that never
appeared

  gradually the monotonous crackling of the furnace
and the steady drone of the electrical machinery worked
on him he grew drowsy nothing mattered to his
fagged brain any more the world was doomed he
didnt have to watch those dials he slumped far over
one arm of the pilot seat his outflung hand bumped
lightly against a tiny lever that gleamed brightly on
the ships control board under the cold light of a little
glass illuminating globe set in the ceiling the catch
of the lever was released and the pring that was at-
tached to it made it snap into a jew position a low
musical droning almost smothered by the noise of the
furnace set in the ship gave a slight lurch its pro-
pelling machinery was running at full capacity sending
it hurtling across space but sark ahar did not notice
he was fast asleep

  for hours he slept odd dreams flitted through his
brain devils and imps and what not danced and
grimaced before his minds eye he saw the moon and
then he saw lurid flames suddenly leap out of it finally
he dreamed that he a noted scientist had invented a
atomic fire



mechanical man-a great metal giant with fanged jaws
taloned hands and flaming eyes he dreamed that the
giant had turned upon him-was going to kill him he
felt its hot claws around his throat and its fiery breath
against his cheek

  sark ahar awoke with a start his dream had been
part reality the chamber was glowing like a white hot
inferno and flickering black shadows of fantastic pieces
of apparatus were dancing on the walls the light in
the illuminating globes had somehow died out the
young aerthian could hear a thunderous roar quite dis-
tinct from the noise the furnace had once produced it
was louder and more terrible the air all about was
terrifically hot it scalded sark ahars lungs ther
was a vapor in it--a strange fiery gas he could see
long slender pencilings of it reaching over and under the
thick lead shields around the furnace like the tentacles
of a luminous octopus luckily for him he was behind
one of those lead shields if he had not been the deadly
emanations would have killed him

  what had happened  atomic energy atomic
energy at last the words fairly shrieked through his
brain but what of it it was too late to do anything
besides that terrific power couldnt be controlled hed
almost forgotten that it couldnt be controlled

  he grabbed a long buckler-like sheet of lead which had
a hand-grip on one side of it it was convex and was
as tall as a mart and resembled the shields which archers
of a forgotten antiquity had used it would protect
him from the dangerous rays

  he held it out in -front of him and peered through the
glazed peep-hole which was on a level with his eyes
the bottom of the furnace must have melted away
there was a dazzling mass of bluish incandescence vis-
ible beneath the lead shields around the caldron-like
piece of apparatus it was hissing and spitting like a
violently active chemical the steel floor was burning
and the atomic fire was spreading-consuming every-
thing in its path in a few minutes the whole ship
would be a fiery mass of incandescence

  sark ahar stared wildly about what should he do
try to save himself try to save aggar ho it was
better to freeze than to burn to death

  his eyes fell on the dials of the control board
though aerths satellite was now of course invisible
he could tell by the delicate instruments that the ship
was hurtling along at a terrific rate only five thousand
miles from the moon its course was parallel to the
lunar surface

a crazy idea that marked him forever as a genius
came to sark ahar how it was born no man
may tell quick as a flash he gripped the steering lever
and swung it around a full quarter turn the space
flier lurched then it swung inward and headed straight
toward the moon falling more and more rapidly every
instant

  aggar ho shrieked sark ahar come down
quick you do not wish to burn carefully manipu-
lating his big protecting shield so that it was always
between him and the rapidly spreading conflagration at
the center of the room sark ahar made his way to the
spiral stairway he saw the old scientist descending

  get a lead shield in the upper store-room aggar

ho ne cried else yon will be killed by the rays
come quickly

  in a moment the martian was with him

  they followed another downward leading spiral and
found themselves in a cylindrical room that housed a
tiny torpedo-shaped space-flier sark ahar opened a
circular door in the side of the craft and thrust the old
scientist unceremoniously inside he followed closely
slamming the door behind him he dropped into the
pilot seat a turn of a knob and a door at one end of
the tubular chamber that housed the space-boat opened
in a moment the little craft glided gracefully out into the
open free from the blazing sphere

  sark ahar allowed the globe to get fully a hundred
miles ahead of him in its headlong rush moon ward
then at a safe distance he followed it

  he turned toward aggar ho who was in the passen-
ger seat behind him i think i have saved aerth chief
he said there was a broad smile on his face

  saved aerth returned aggar ho what do you
mean i see that we have released the power which
we sought but that will do us no good now

  watch for a little while chief said sark ahar

  in the next minute and a half the sphere became a
globe of blue-white fire and presently after the two
aerthians had followed it in its fall for about three
thousand miles it exploded sending out its flaming frag-
ments cone-wise toward the moon the lunar surface
two thousand miles below was dimly visible by their
light the pieces of the space-ship glowed brighter and
continued their headlong descent still sark ahar
dove after them in a few minutes the fragments
crashed into the satellite scattering themselves over
mountain crater and dead sea bottom nor did their
fire die out it increased in intensity fed by the fine
sand which covered most of the moon it was spread-
ing rapidly enveloping everything in its path

  sark ahar was smiling do you understand
chief he asked

  aggar ho had completely forgotten his habitual calm
i do he cried you meant to kindle an atomic fire
on the moon and make it take the place of our sun
and you have succeeded

  the two men returned to aerth within three days
the moons surface had become entirely incandescent a
week later aerth was much the same as it had been for
thousands of years except that the spring crops had been
destroyed and almost half of the population had per-
ished but nature quickly mends and forgets such
calamities in the long course of cosmic history they
are common

  since the moon travels slowly in its orbit in the same
direction that aerth revolves the days were of course
a trifle longer

  aggar ho predicted correctly that in fifty years the
sun would absorb its enveloping cloud and would shine
with greater intensity than it had for countless ages

  ten thousand years afterward throngs of eager
travelers still came to panenbu to view a majestic work
of art which awoke in them admiration for a great man
of the past at the pinnacle of what had once been
the landing tower of the observatory stood a colossal
statue across its breast was ingraved the inscription
this is sark ahar native aerthian who saved aerth

author of bartons island the seventh generation etc

hy not take your medicine and have
it over with larry

  the words were gently spoken by
arthur hovey who sprawled lazily
on a divan in his friends luxuriously
appointed apartment

  laurence conover cut short his restless pacing and
crushed a half-smoked cigarette in the already heaping
tray for a moment he glared at the speaker then
he smiled grimly and shrugged his shoulders

  guess ill have to he admitted odds against me
are too great but it burns me up ive only two
months too

  yeah two months his friend gazed dreamily
at nothing in particular

  art hovey was that way

larrys companion since boy-
hood he had ever been easy-
going-a dreamer too larry
though two years his senior
was more impetuous the
leader in all their youthful
adventures and leader still
having attained the presidency
of the corporation for which
art worked as a department
manager

  it isnt that i dislike alta
farrish continued larry

shes a good friend but
hang it i dont want to marry
her guess im old-fashioned

but id like to go back about
a hundred years to the days
of lindbergh and gene tun-
ney and owen d young

they did things in those days

and they didnt have their
every conscious act controlled
by legislation

  they had prohibition

  you would bring that up

thats what started the whole business too the gloom-
dispensers got away with that and theyve gotten away
with murder ever since but our board of eugenics
beats anything they ever cooked up i rebel against
having a bride forced upon me think of it im two
months short of thirty-two and have to marry before
my birthday have to and not outside of class a

  whats the matter with a theres only one
higher class and it with only eighteen members

  nothing the matter with it but i havent found
romance in my own rating i want to choose my own
mate court her as they used to take her away from
someone if necessary what do i care about their in-
telligence tests their blood counts and other ratings
maybe our ancestors didnt raise a regulated number of
kids kids who wore thick glasses at five years of age
and quoted ovid as ours do today but they loved and
hated normally played and fought and got a kick out
of life howre you going to do it today

  cant but its a pretty good old world at that bet-
ter than mars or venus

  sure it is but thats not
the point its this infernal
regulation of everything the
martians and venetians were
used to it so was most of
our old world population but
heritage of freedom and inde-
pendence taken from us and
to some of us it comes pretty
hard

  but we dont do anything
larry

  no a lot of sheep
you couldnt do anything
anyway altas guardian you
know

  i know john x mills
votes fifty-one per cent of
our stock and hes set on
the match otherwise theres
a lot of other as i might
look over in two months
still thinking of romance
larry laughed good old
art he said romance
means nothing in your life
does it

  not a thing

  arthur hovey gazed reflectively at the swarms of
darting aircraft high above the crystal expanse of new
yorks roof these visits to larrys apartment were
his greatest joy here he could lie in the light of the
sun he could revel in its warmth as it came through
the fused quartz covering of the homes of the wealthy
and influential in the topmost level of the worlds

 qtlnce time immemorial it
 kj seems to us man has rebelled
 against every tendency toward
 what seemed to him an infringe-
 ment of his personal liberty but
 in every age some new law seems
 to be invented specially to increase
 mans misery the next line of
 action seems to be beautifully laid
 out for us already-that is the
 next really important change but
 that-and the author tells about it
 in this story-will probably not go
 through however until life has
 become somewhat more standard-
 ized which on the other hand
 cant be so far off at that

amazing stories

 greatest city one hundred and ten stories above ground
 it was great cares and dissatisfactions seemed of no
 consequence

 next morning larry sat at his desk and stared dis-
 approvingly at the pile of work that lay before
 him he glanced at the calendar fifty-nine days left
 he rang for his secretary

miss henderson has resigned mr conover the
voice of his chief clerk spoke from the optophone
simultaneously with the appearance of that individuals
alert features in its disc

 resigned wasnt she satisfied

 yes indeed board of vocational supervision de-
 rated her and she was ashamed to remain with us shes
 taken a lesser position elsewhere sir

 what cant we determine the fitness of our own
 employees

 yes sir that is i mean no sir the board is
 sending a substitute at once

oh damn the board

 the startled face of the chief clerk vanished from the
 disc

 for a long time larry scowled at the silent instru-
 ment before him boards boards boards there
 was a board for almost everything it seemed well
 there was nothing he could do might as well submit
 to the inevitable he was only a cog in the huge ma-
 chine that moved at the command of the terrestrial
 government a fairly easily-worked cog it was true
 but immutably fixed in position and function what
 was the use

 the optophone spoke miss sinclair to see you
 miss sinclair

 yes sir from the board applying for miss hen-
 dersons place

 oh yes send her in

 larry was utterly unprepared for the vision of love-
 liness that met his eyes a moment later his heart
 skipped a beat and he sprang from his chair with un-
 concealed eagerness then he caught himself short in
 embarrassed realization of the situation

 miss sinclair he faltered

 yes mr conover una sinclair vr

never mind the numbers youre an experienced
secretary 

 five years with the board of tri-planetarian com-
 munication

 another board so help me

 i beg your pardon

 larry chuckled dont mind me miss sinclair he
 apologized think youd like to work for united syn-
 thetic food

 im sure i would

 very well tell mr sprague ive put you on hell
 arrange your salary with you then return to me for
 instructions please

when una sinclair tripped from the room larry
took up the nervous pacing that was becoming a habit
with him not such a bad board at that this voca-
tional one

 tve found her at last

 a ten days had passed and larry was again enter-
 taining art hovey in his apartment

 thats no news una sinclair isnt it

 of course

  how about her b of e rating

  a i wanted to do a handspring when she told

me

  easy now larry youre getting all excited and
quit your eternal tramping dont you know that old
man mills is getting set for your marriage to alta
sure but im going to call it off right now too
over the opto altall be tickled silly she doesnt
want me any more than i want her

  all the same you cant do it larry millsll break
you united synthetic will hit bottom in this crazy
market if he starts unloading then wherell you be
hang it im in love i tell you what do i care
for the money i can earn a substantial living may-
be have to live in level forty but whats the difference 
have you asked una

  not yet but thereve been things-more than mere
hints im pretty sure shell have me

  with your money gone

  another crack like that art hovey and ill crown
you una isnt that sort

  sorry larry i know it but youre in for trouble
do you know that

  trouble if theres to be any ill start it right
away

  larry turned to his optophone

  hello laurence came the hearty voice of john x
mills when his ruddy features materialized on the disc
what brings you to the opto on a rest day

  its about alta john the weddings off

  larry spoke crisply and the bristling eyebrows of
john x mills raised in surprise the red of his round
cheeks deepening perceptibly

  what do you mean off everything is arranged
i know it and im sorry john but i have other
plans my decision will come as a relief to alta-you
know that

  come come my boy dont be hasty that new
secretary of yours has turned your head

  perhaps but this is final the conversation was
growing distasteful to larry and mills appearance of
imminent apoplexy made him want to laugh

  final  final  im not sure of that laurence at
any rate youll not marry that red-head in your office
the disc went dark for mills had disconnected

  red-head red-head yelled larry to the unres-
ponsive instrument you old fossil

  then he stared foolishly at art who remained calm
and wholly undignified where he lay stretched among the
cushions

  told you so his friend remarked soothingly

the die was cast and larry hastened to be sure of
una he rushed from the apartment leaving art
to shift for himself panicky doubts assailed him when
he entered the uptown pneumatic tube and took his place
in the bullet-like car that would whisk him to the upper
reaches of westchester borough he had been rather
hasty and abrupt with mills should have talked with
una first

  the girl he thought greeted him with some indica-
tion of constraint but he imagined this to be due to the
fact that this was his first visit to her modest eighteenth-
level apartment she flushed as prettily as ever when
she pressed his fingers and he plunged headlong into
the subject of his chaotic thoughts

  una he blurted forth  love you and i want you
too many boards



for my wife in these past few days you have become

to me the essence of all that is worth while-the-

  she dropped weakly into a chair as he spoke and a
look of fear widened her eyes but mr conover-
larry- she protested

  i know dear-it is short notice but this thing is
real with me i can think of nothing else and some-
how ive come to believe that you reciprocate am i
wrong dont you

  no-no-it isnt that

  what then theres no one else

 no one and-i do care-but-

  suddenly the girl was in his arms-weeping uncon-
trollably she clung to him in terror it seemed he
had not been wrong but the depth of her feeling
frightened him he sensed calamity

larry she finally whispered i do care for you
more than you will ever know but we can not wed
can not wed but why why he held her
at arms length and his heart sank at what he saw writ-
ten on her blanched features

  my eugenic rating-it-it-

  but its a i saw your card

  it was a larry she was quieting now and
spoke with hopeless finality but now it is f day be-
fore yesterday i took my annual test and i just received
notice this morning

  there isnt any f grade only the five letters and
their sub-numbers you must be mistaken

  its the new classification something to do with
pigmentation they tell me guess its my freckles
and she smiled bravely through her tears

  larry raved these rotten restrictions again but
he had never anticipated this and had entirely forgotten
the added classification to think that una of all girls
should be reclassed he thought darkly of mills and
his threats but this was no doing of his the
eugenics department was incorruptible besides it had
been done two days ago but how mills would gloat
over him suddenly he stopped in his tracks-he had
been walking the floor again he realized shamefacedly-
and wrinkled his brow in thought

  una regarded him kindly and sympathetically from
where she sat she was as crushed as he but being a
woman was more resigned her heart ached more for
larry than for herself and she longed to pillow his
head on her knees and mother him he was such a
big overgrown boy

  say larrys forceful exclamation startled her
he was at her side in a single bound and squatted be-
side her chair are you game to elope with me
elope we cant it is impossible to be legally
married in either earth venus or mars where else
is there to go-

  mercury

  larry it has a terrible climate and is-oh-un-
civilized besides its government is unrecognized by
the tri-planetary alliance wed be exiles in an awful
land where we could never live in peace

  honey-listen its just the opposite ive a very
good friend chic davis whos captain of the rocket
iii one of the tri-planetarian liners he tells me
mercury is the finest of all the inhabited bodies its
terrifically hot on the side always toward the sun and
frigid on the other but theres a narrow belt where the
climate is moderate-semi-tropical by earthly standards
and its not uncivilized but highly cultured theyve

a real democratic government there and arent members
of the alliance only because its their own desire to
remain aloof our rigid laws and the resulting stand-
ardization of types habits and activities of our people
are distasteful to them but chicks been there and
he says its ideal-the very place for such as we we
could be free and untrammeled-happy

  but the liners are not permitted to stop there
good reason the allies fear their population would
be educated to a spirit of revolt if they saw too much or
knew too much of the conditions on mercury so they
permit no voyagers to land there but ill bet i can
get chick to smuggle us in somehow hes a great
schemer

  it seems so-i dont know-barbaric somehow
are you certain of all these things your friend has told
you 

  absolutely chick hasnt a reason in the world to
misrepresent it to me and there arent barbarians
there sweetheart they are a kindly people and wise-
too wise to mix with the others of the outer planets im
sure wed be welcome and ill work ill break my
neck to make you happy there what do you say
you almost convince me unas eyes were starry
they now visioned a ray of hope

  larry drew her fiercely close youve got to
honey he begged its our only chance six weeks
you know and ive got to marry-someone in a-
someone i dont love else its the penal colony of
mars for the rest of my life-laboring on the canals

i swear id rather-

  una placed the tips of her warm fingers over his
lips dont say it dear she whispered it isnt
necessary ill go im not afraid and oh larry-
i-i need you

  wordless happiness crept in to replace the erstwhile
gloom of the tiny apartment

the rocket iii was berthed on her huge float fifty
miles off montauk point a monster dirigible
from the mainland had just discharged its cargo the
highly concentrated liquid explosive which provided
tremendous propulsive energy for the liner in limited
storage space and was headed for home scores of
smaller private aircraft hovered at a respectful distance
awaiting the take-off of the great vessel-a sight they
had come hundreds even thousands of miles to witness

  captain davis stood at the hyper-optophone in the
control room of his space ship he had reported to the
board of tri-planetary transportation in washington
that all was well for the one hundredth voyage of the
rocket iii he grinned when he turned from the disc
the board was due for a surprise this trip

  the published passenger list had carefully omitted the
names of certain of those actually aboard captain
davis had seen to that as he had seen to the obtaining
of unas and larrys passports ostensibly for a trip
to venus other essential matters there were too that
had required his personal attention but it was a job
that chick davis liked for he doted on romance be-
sides he scented an unusual adventure

  the time for departure was at hand and the shrill
siren on the float warned the surrounding visitors to
withdraw to a safe distance the screaming exhaust
of the vessels rocket tubes was a thing to be feared an
incandescent blast that could wither and destroy the
greatest of the ships of the lower air


amazing stories

  with its five hundred feet of glistening length resting
in the chute its blunt nose pointed skyward at an angle
of thirty degrees the rocket iii was a thing of beauty
a monument to the genius and scientific attainment of
mankind but when the mighty energies were re-
leased from within it became a monster of terrifying
power a mechanism that went roaring into the skies
ahead of a trail of blinding magnificence splitting the
protesting air with a screech whose intensity was beyond
all belief

  precisely on schedule the rocket iii hurled itself
into the heavens when the last vestige of its flaming
tail had vanished the awed spectators turned their ships
homeward stunned and silenced by this marvel of the
twenty-first century

  far outside the earths atmosphere the vessel straight-
ened away on its course and settled to its carefully
regulated rate of acceleration the captain was enter-
taining a much excited couple in his cabin

there was consternation in the despatching room
of the tri-planetarian transportation boardin wash-
ington the rocket iii had long since left her berth
and the engineers in charge had observed her progress
on the chart for more than ten million miles then
the tiny light-point of red that traveled so slowly from
the blue-white representation of the earths orb flickered
and went out frantic efforts to raise the ships hyper-
optophone failed utterly and the chief despatcher made
haste to report the calamity

  every available space-ship of the terrestrial govern-
ment was pressed into service and the liners of the tri-
planetarian system already in transit were advised by
optophone to keep close watch for the wanderer but
little hope was entertained of locating the vessel in this
manner in the vastness of space even the largest of
liners was an infinitesimal mite and with its opto in-
operative became but one of myriads of tiny bodies that
hurtled through the blackness at enormous speed

  the nature of the disaster which had overtaken the
rocket iii could but be conjectured nothing of the
sort had occurred during more than thirty years of con-
tinued interplanetary service great fear there was in
official circles that the vessels fuel compartment had
exploded though such an accident was deemed highly
improbable it was not beyond the bounds of possibility
and it was an undoubted fact that something of a seri-
ous nature had happened to the mighty vessel of the
skies

  efforts were made to keep the news of the disaster
from the public but as is usually the case there was
a leak within a very few hours the public and private
news optos throughout the world blared forth the in-
credible tidings frantic relatives and friends of the
more than twelve hundred passengers and three hundred
members of the crew besieged the various departments
of the terrestrial government in washington for con-
firmation or denial of the terrible news in the lower
levels of the great cities the public squares were jammed
with horror-stricken humanity waiting in vain for
definite assurance from the news announcers

  hour after hour the vigil was kept and eventually the
reports of the government scouting ships commenced
coming in but these held forth nothing of hope there
was but one chance in many millions that trace of the
lost ones would ever be uncovered

  but the officials of the board refused to give up their

vessel as lost though hoping against hope its captain
charles davis was the most resourceful and experi-
enced in the service they could not conceive of him
as unequal to any emergency which might have arisen

on the planet mercury an unusual conference was
in progress in the executive chambers or dairofa
in luzan the capital city of the realm in the great
plaza before the palace there rested a space ship of
strange design a small and sleek craft that had been
the subject of discussion throughout the city during
the twelve aka about six and one-half earth days since
its arrival from afar

  the huge blood-red disc of the sun shone hotly at the
horizon its almost horizontal rays making of the city
a motley of sweltering high lights and dark shadows
rose tinted mists hung low over all effectually obscur-
ing the heavens above it was always thus in luzan
the sun never leaving the horizon entirely but circling
it once in every eighty-eight earth days and alternately
rising to a point that exposed the lower rim of the
enormous disc then sinking to a point where the top-
most edge just peeped through the mists above the
undulating line of demarcation between land and sky

  suddenly there came from above a fearsome sound
a screaming roar that brought the populace to the streets
and the officials and their subordinates from the palace
once twice thrice the sky was shot with a blinding
stab of light a huge shape swung into view through
the mists another and larger space ship a moment
it poised at the edge of the plaza then swooped to a
landing and rolled slowly to a lumbering stop

  the assembled mercurians stared agape when the
main port was opened and the gangplank lowered
never before had one of the huge liners of the tri-
planetarian alliance made actual landing on the globe
murmurs of surprised interest greeted the appearance
of the only three visitors to disembark from the giant
vessel-a girl a young woman of fragile and delicate
mold by mercurian standards and two men who were
likewise of terrestrial littleness in stature

areful now you two chick davis warned
as una and larry edged gingerly along the gang-
plank itll take you a little time to get used to the
lesser gravity and rare air though you weigh less
than a third of what you do on earth the slightest effort
will exhaust you here so just take it easy

  una laughed nervously i feel as though i could
leap across the plaza she said

  you could-nearly agreed the captain but until
your lungs are accustomed to the change and your heart
to the extra load imposed by the scarcity of oxygen
youd better not try anything of the kind

  say chick exclaimed larry thats a terrestrial
government ship over there wonder whats up
probably theyve been searching for us since our
optophone went out of commission guess ill be in
for an argument after a bit but they cant prove any-
thing that reminds me too-better find the trouble
now and report our whereabouts captain davis
winked and grinned as larry turned a scared face to-
ward him

  theyll discipline you chick

  let em i wouldnt have missed this for anything
ive had a circus on this trip and i guess i can square
myself
too many boards



  una drew back suddenly in alarm grasping larry
and pointing a trembling finger look she gasped
theres john mills

  it was incredible but true on the platform facing
the plaza there stood a group of mercurian officials
and with them were four terrestrials one of these
a pudgy human with ruddy countenance was undoubt-
edly john x mills

  larry groaned then stiffened in anger miserable
swine he snarled been spying on me and learned
my plans  ill show him 

  so quickly did he move in the direction of the tri-
umphantly leering financier that his leap carried him a
distance of thirty or more feet he lost his balance
and sprawled ignominiously at the edge of the platform
john x mills laughed

  chick davis was at larrys side in an instant and as
he helped him to his feet he hissed keep your shirt on
you idiot were in a jam got to be diplomatic
una hurried to join them her breath coming in pain-
ful gasps she wanted to cry larry grumbled sheep-
ishly as she made nervously ineffectual attempts to dust
his clothes with her handkerchief

  captain davis strode to the center of the platform
and faced the dairo president of the mercurian high
council speaking rapidly in termarven the universal
language which had been developed when interplanetar-
ian communication was first accomplished in 

  your excellency said chick i am captain of the
rocket iii a disarrangement of our electrical system
partially crippled the vessel and it was necessary for us
to land here to make repairs meanwhile i learned that
these two young people of our world were endavoring to
escape persecution in their own land they wish to
marry but cannot on account of one of our rigid laws-
the eugenics act with which you are undoubtedly
familiar i beg of you that they be permitted to make
their home here and to wed in accordance with your
laws they freely renounce allegiance to the terrestrial
government	

  i remember you captain davis replied the dairo
you have visited us before though you have never
honored us by landing your vessel but i cannot ac-
cede to your request

  can not there is no treaty mercury is inde-
pendent of the tri-planetarian alliance

  true but a minor agreement has just been signed
with representatives of your government we have
agreed that all terrestrials who might visit our globe
are returnable at the demand of your government and
are subject to your laws for so long a time as they
remain with us however if your ambassador agrees
we will welcome this man and woman

  larry understood termarven but imperfectly and he
stared from one to the other of the speakers in uncer-
tainty una clung desperately to him

  the dairo indicated one of the four terrestrials a
pompous individual who bowed ceremoniously at the
acknowledgment

  hjalmar nordstrum captain he said in english
at your service

  you heard

  i heard captain

  he lies croaked mills but nordstrum frowned
him into silence

  captain said the ambassador it is impossible to
grant your request as you know we have been trying

for years to come to an understanding with the mer-
curians and this mission of mine is the latest attempt
it has succeeded thus far and the preliminary treaty is
an entering wedge that we can not afford to nullify by
an immediate violation of one of its provisions i must
further remind you captain that you are subject to
disciplining for landing your vessel here

  ill take care of that mr ambassador but may i
ask you who was the instigator of this special mission-
who wrote this clause

 why-why- the ambassador flushed and john

x mills coughed warningly

  ha i thought so chic davis glared at mills
belligerently then disdainfully at nordstrum no
wonder the mercurians have always refused to treat
with us when our government sends such as you to deal
with them dont see why they listened this time
sir ill have you broken for this i-i- the
ambassador was sputtering with rage mills grasped
his arm and whispered in his ear

  larry was doing his best to comfort una who had
buried her head on his shoulder the mercurians
watched silently the dairo stretched to his full seven
feet of dignified stature arms folded across his broad
chest

  i demand their arrest shouted mills the girl
and laurence conover they are fugitives from jus-
tice attempting to evade both the compulsory mar-
riage act and the eugenics act ill appear against
them before the boards

  the ambassador nodded agreement and the remain-
ing two terrestrials advanced toward una and larry
flashing badges of the secret service larrys muscle
tensed in his fury and una gripped him more tightly

  dont dear she whispered please-for my sake
itll only be worse for you

  chick davis paused uncertainly then turned on his
heels and rapidly made for his vessel covering the in-
tervening distance with a peculiar shuffling lope that
was admirably adapted to the gravity conditions
chick chick called larry

  but his friend continued on his way bitterly larry
watched him go hed deserted him and in the time of
greatest need but after all what could he do

  larrys muscle relaxed and una sighed her relief
the officers were upon them and she had been horrified
at thought of the result of resistance on his part

 a moment please asked the dairo do i
a understand that these two are to be arrested and
returned to terra to stand trial

  it is our law your excellency replied nordstrum
a strange law it is that separates lovers so obviously
suited to one another but i presume that your solons
know best i do not profess to understand but would
know more regarding the circumstances shall we re-
tire to the dairofa and discuss the case in detail

  as you wish excellency the ambassador was
chagrined but could do naught but acquiesce mills
fidgeted and fumed

  larry pricked up his ears over the dairos speech the
sympathy of this president of the mercurian council
gave him renewed hope he would present his own
case there still might be some way in which that
cursed treaty could be abrogated but that forlom
hope was quickly blasted when the dairo addressed them
from his place at the head of the council table


amazing stories

  the treaty stands he said it has been officially
signed and sealed but i feel that we are entitled to
the facts of this unfortunate case our people will
question the justice of such a procedure as is proposed
and apparently necessary we must be prepared to
satisfy them as to the wisdom of our judgment in carry-
ing on this and future negotiations with the outer
planets

  we understand honored dairo smiled the ambas-
sador his precious agreement was safe but i must
ask mr mills to give to you the complete history of the
affair i am unfamiliar with the details

  john x mills cleared his throat this would be
somewhat difficult as he spoke no termarven and would
have to tell his story to the interpreter the members
of the mercurian council cast solemn yet kindly glances
on una and larry when mills pointed an accusing fore-
finger at the couple

  these two- he began but there came an inter-
ruption

  a page advanced hurriedly to the council table and
the dairo motioned mills into silence

  captain davis announced the page demands ad-
mittance

  the dairo brightened send him in he ordered

  the conversation was in the mercurian tongue and
mills stood perplexedly silent but larry had caught
the name of his friend and guessed at the meaning of
the interruption he squeezed unas hand joyfully
good old chick he hadnt left them after all and
somehow he felt that things would happen quickly now

  chick davis advanced to the council table with a
broad grin on his face he was accompanied by two
terrestrials a man and a woman

  larry craned his neck to see who they were art
hovey why the big stiff he had been on the
rocket iii-and never looked up his friend what did
it mean and the girl alta farrish he blinked
his eyes in amazement

  alta gasped john x mills what are you doing
here 

  that is what i intended asking you she smiled
sweetly but it seemed that she drew a bit closer to the
side of arthur hovey

  larry was completely mystified but he felt an
almost uncontrollable impulse to laugh aloud in this
great domed chamber one more shock like this and
mills would surely die of apoplexy his purpled fea-
tures and bulging eyes would have made a horse laugh

  the irate financier forgot himself he forgot that
he was in the presence of the nobility and the highest
authority of a strange planet

  what do you mean he roared am i not your
legal guardian who gave you permission to leave
home answer me

  the dairo frowned in annoyance but he did not in-
terfere

  art hovey stepped forward keeping alta in the
background you are speaking to my wife mr
mills he said quietly

  there was a momentary silence then john x
mills far outdid his previous efforts he shook his fist
in the face of the young man who had so calmly an-
nounced the preposterous affront to his authority he
ranted and stormed

  the dairo pounded vigorously for silence this
terrestrial was insufferable

  ambassador nordstrum spoke sharply to his com-
patriot and mills subsided mopping his perspiring brow
with a large silk handkerchief he wished he had these
two youngsters at home

  mbassador asked the dairo will you be
l so kind as to request the young people to present
their side of the story it seems to be much involved

  nordstrum translated rapidly and art hovey stepped
to the table larry regarded him in astonishment
guess he hadnt known his friend as well as he thought
such a transformation he had never considered possible
the usually phlegmatic art was supremely confident
dominant compelling he directed his remarks at the
ambassador

  mr nordstrum he said you have ben hood-
winked by mills he has used this mission as a means
to a personal end his sole object in appealing to con-
gress at this time was to prevent the marriage of my
friend to the girl he loves and force him to marry the
woman who is now my wife john x mills is a
scheming and unscrupulous rascal

  i am beginning to believe that is true interjected
nordstrum this thing was a sorry mess he felt
suddenly ashamed

  i know it is true continued art for i have in-
vestigated and have learned many things for years
i have loved alta farrish his ward but i never courted
her for mills had planned her marriage to my dear
friend laurence conover i thought she cared for
him and that eventually he would submit to mills
wishes but my friend had other plans and i wished
to help him so i set about to learn the true state of
affairs first off i found that my fondest dreams were
possible of realization i- he hesitated and glanced
at his bride for approval she nodded happily

  anyhow we were married-perfectly in order-a
classification and everything but my friend to be
happy must escape the laws of the three outer planets
he planned to settle here in mercury and found a way
to reach this planet but i learned that mills had been
watching him by means of the detectoscope-had fol-
lowed his every movement so i watched mills i dis-
coverd the machinations he used in engineering this
official mission to the inner planet so i followed on
the rocket iii though my friend did not know i was
on board i wanted to surprise him-here-to be of
some assistance should it become necessary

  art youre a brick exclaimed larry he could
scarcely credit his senses to think of art doping this
out-fooling him 

  but i havent told you the worst art paused
dramatically mills not only deceived my friend he
deceived his ward the stock he votes in united syn-
thetic food is but half his own the other portion is
altas he voted it by proxy and has forged papers
which convinced her that he could thus control it until
her marriage this has been the club he held over
larry conover and over his ward to force the union he
planned-a union that interested him only because he
thought it would permit him to retain control of the
vast business he has dominated for so many years

  liar grated mills but his tone was far from
convincing

  its the truth heres the proof art handed a
sheaf of papers to the ambassador who scanned them
carefully
too many boards



  larry could have kicked himself fool that he had
been not to investigate the matter himself

  mills said nordstrum sternly hes got the goods
on you id keep my mouth shut now if i were you
im through

  he turned to the dairo your excellency he said
i offer humble apology i find that this young man
speaks truth and that i have been deceived into becom-
ing an unwitting party to the selfish scheme of my
countryman on behalf of my government i now pro-
pose to cancel the treaty we have signed if it be your
desire that this be done

  john x mills slumped low in his chair and stared
at the floor he seethed with rage yet he dared not
retort

  ambassador announced the dairo you have acted
in good faith and we blame you not for the deeds of
this-this member of your party it is thought best
ynder the circumstances that the papers be destroyed
and the incident forgotten the young couple who are
not permitted to wed by your laws may remain with us
if they wish there is no bar to their union here

  the interpreter repeated his words in english and
the five terrestrials from the rocket iii gathered in an
excited huddle losing all interest in the ceremony of de-
stroying the agreement

  chick davis could not restrain a joyous hooray

xtou old fox exclaimed larry gripping arts

  i hand tightly you sure did put it over on me
and boy you saved the day

  una clung to her lover an unaccountable lump in
her throat she was happy to be with him happy in
the knowledge that nothing now prevented them from
joining their lives but somehow she was frightened
homesick she saw the disapproval of her own kind
in the eyes of the mercurians and she feared they would
not be as welcome as the dairo implied but she would
stick to larry through anything he was all that mat-
tered after all

  but art objected alta we cant leave them here
we must have larry in new york united synthetic
food depends on him and so do we the reorganiza-
tion-we must vote our stock with his to keep control
and to save the business from my guardian besides
i dont think una likes it here as well i know i
didnt

  you forgot said art the classification-unas
derating

  here was a facer larry looked into unas eyes and
saw that what alta said was true she didnt like it
in luzan matter of fact he wasnt so hot for it him-
self it had sounded better when chick told about it
lord what a mess but hed stay in hades to have
una

  arts usually placid brow was furrowed in thought
good old art he had come through in a blaze of
glory didnt think he had it in him guess altad
pepped him up he had something to work for now
imagine-holding secret his feelings for her-all these
years

  psst una-quick art was whispering in her
ear your board of eugenics tag-give it to me got
an idea

  wonderingly she took the tiny silver chain from her
wrist and handed it to larrys friend carefully he

examined the markings on the surface of the little tag
then he strode to the council table

  your excellency he said when the dairo greeted
him may i ask one question of john x mills

  the request was quickly repeated by the interpreter
and the dairo signified his assent

  art advanced to the now cowering financier ambas-
sador nordstrum groaned what revelation was com-
ing now wasnt it bad enough now without further
fuss the mission was already a failure but this
young hovey seemed to know his business

  mr mills said art in a steely voice you know
raymond phelps do you not

  mills dropped his eyes his high color faded to a
sickly mottled pallor he stammered unintelligibly but
did not reply

  answer him mills warned the ambassador

  yes-i know him breathed the thoroughly fright-
ened man

  you bet you know him arts voice rose in anger
know him too dam well and you bribed him to
derate una sinclair-an official of the incorruptible
board of eugenics but youd corrupt a saint you
did it now-didnt you

  the pudgy hands of the financier twitched nervously
where they gripped the arms of the chair he half rose
from his seat then fell weakly back

  did you mills did you the ambassadors voice
was chill you miserable skunk-answer

  but john x mills was unequal to speech he stared
in terror at the livid face of the ambassador and nodded
his head in agreement

  good lord nordstrum was aghast to think
that he had assisted this dirty hound youll pay for
this john mills and right now your first act is going
to be a full and complete confession to the manager
of the terrestrial government-over the optophone
get me  march now by george youll not only con-
fess but youll go back with me-under arrest sub-
sidize our officials will you furthermore well have
miss sinclair reinstated in a at once this vile
scheming of yours can no longer affect them these
two young people can be married immediately-on the
rocket iii if they wish-captain davis has authority
he propelled mills from the room ungently the mer-
curians looking on with open approval chick davis
indulged in an undignified jig

  boy youre a marvel larry hugged art gleefully
and i know who our new vice president in charge
of sales is going to be you could sell ice to the
eskimos

  alta gurgled her approval she knew that art had
it in him poor boy hed always kept himself in
the background-and on her account things would be
different now

  una didnt know whether she wanted to laugh or cry
it was all too good to be true

ambassador nordstrum was as good as his

 word for within the space of a very few minutes
he returned from the government vessel with news that
unas reinstatement was already approved he per-
sonally voided her tag and wrote a temporary certificate
of classification 

alta pleaded for her guardian and eventually nord-

menace
from andromeda

        by nat schachner and arthur l zagat

                          illustrated by morey

with a puzzled frown donald stand-
ish looked up from the photographic
plates in front of him to the patch of
dark blue heaven visible through the
half-opened dome of the mt wilson
observatory there floated the enigmatic nebula of
andromeda-the huge telescope probing directly toward
it-as if to pluck out the very secret of its being he
arose and paced the confines of the huge room under
thirty clean cut in features he had already earned an
enviable deputation as an astronomer which had won
him a rovqted place in the world famous observatory
from the very beginning the great nebula had exercised
a peculiar fascination over him in some inexplicable
way standish had always felt that there lay the secret
of the universe waiting for him in the role of a perseus
to deliver and bring forth

   in truth many other contemplative observers had
speculated about that faint dusty patch of light sprawled
athwart the enchained and enchanted body of the
legendary daughter of cepheus and cassiopeia for cen-
turies men had pondered in vain seeking the nature
of that faint light-cloud which so persistently evaded
their probings it was not until recently with the great
advance in the manufacture and use of precision in-
struments and telephoto lenses that the astounding truth
had been revealed to startled astronomers-this faint
glimmer in the skies is a great island universe of stars

	far beyond the confines of our own galaxy-millions on
millions of suns and attendant planets careening
through the outermost reaches of space-time so incon-
ceivably remote that a ray of light traveling 
miles per second would take nearly a million years to
reach the earth

   standish turned once more to the sheaf of photo-
graphs yes-there wasno doubt about it the faint
pin-prick of light labeled on the sky charts as 
which he had himself named alcoreth showed an un-
mistakable increase in brightness in this most recent of
his photographs

   for over a year on every clear night he had photo-
 graphed the great nebula the minute pin-pricks of
 light representing huge stars had been laboriously
 ticketed and compared this queer behavior on the
 part of alcoreth hitherto a placid ordinary star
 aroused his interest

   something interesting happening to the constitution
 of that old lady donald remarked to himself medita-
 tively stroking his chin id better turn the prisms
 on her and see whats going on in her innards to account
 for it

   deftly he adjusted the great spectroscope and swung
 it on the errant orb as he gazed a startled whew
 escaped him these were not the spectral lines and
 bands customarily associated with hot gaseous stars in
 eruption

   this is becoming more interesting-better verify
 it he thought quickly he took out his series of com-
 parison spectra none of them checked with this spec-
 trum

   again he arose and paced the room this was evi-
 dently not a burning sun apparently it was a rela-
 tively cold mass what then was it  was it shining
 by reflected light but he argued with himself there
 was no sun within billions of miles to produce such a
 vast outpouring of reflected light there must be some
 other cause for its luminosity excitedly standish
 paced about luminescence-phosphorescence this
 must be a world composed of some radio-active mineral
 he strode back to the spectroscope no these were not
 the characteristic lines of any radio-active mineral known
 to science again he took up his restless pacing the
 word phosphorescence brought to his mind pictures of
 the fields at night alive with the darting sparks of fire-
 flies-of the forests and the glow of rotting fungus and
 decaying wood-of the tropic seas under the southern
 cross criss-crossed with pallid witch-fires

he stoppetd short in his tracks by george that was
it life forms-protoplasm-under certain conditions
- would become strongly luminescent but no-that was




amazing stories

too fantastic for serious consideration and yet-and
yet try as he would to dismiss the thought from his
mind it occurred again and again until it obsessed him
he must check it and that this very minute

  in the course of his researches standish had dis-
covered that by causing the light of luminiferous proto-
plasm to pass through a series of gases the spectroscope
was capable of resolving the constituent elements as
yet the process was a guarded secret but the material
was at hand

  with trembling hands the astronomer set up four thin
walled transparent chambers put into each a definite
quantity of a rare gas-different foreach chamber-at-
tached them in series to the great spectroscope in such
a fashion that the light from alcoreth passed through
them before reaching the prisms that would cause it
to yield up its secret

  what an idiot i am to waste my time on such a
crazy idea he scoffed aloud at the same time looking
around guiltily its damn foolish all right but whats
the odds lets take a look-see he inserted a com-
parison spectrum of the organic elements carbon
hydrogen nitrogen oxygen sulphur and phosphorus-
the essentials of life as we know it on this planet

  with elaborate carelessness hardly masking his inner
trepidation he gazed into the aperture the spectrum
appeared a quick look a longer one then a concen-
trated stare-a feverish scribbling of calculations-then
he arose with a mighty shout that echoed from the great
white dome eureka i have found it  the cry of
archimedes on making his famous discovery the im-
possible was true the life elements were all present on
that distant star and what was infinitely more its spec-
trum showed the peculiar arrangement of lines and
bands which his research had shown was invariably as-
sociated with living protoplasm

  his immediate impulse was to broadcast his discovery
to the scientific world but then a thought sobered him
so fantastic a theory would never be accepted unless
supported by impregnable proof premature publica-
tion and he would become a laughing-stock no he
must wait until his spectroscopic research was perfected
in the meantime keep on observing this strange new
world

  for three weeks he took innumerable photographs
barely pausing for sleep and food the star increased
in brightness then tiny streamers shot forth inter-
mittently then slowly it waned from a fifteenth mag-
nitude star it passed gradually down the scale till finally
a last plate failed to show any trace of it alcoreth was
gone and with her standishs hope of everlasting fame

  the astronomer was in despair how now could he
convince the scoffers that he had witnessed the impos-
sible-a world of living protoplasm his proof was
gone

  yet when he pondered over it-it did not seem im-
possible life-protoplasm-was only a particular com-
bination of five or six elements these elements are
found throughout the universe was it inherently im-
possible or even wildly improbable for these elements
to combine in some other world to form living matter
just as on our own earth various elements combined to
form the rocks that constitute the structure of the world 

  so standish argued and thought wistfully of douglas
cameron his chum of college days now a research
worker on cancer in an isolated laboratory in the fast-
nesses of colorado he thought of douglas aad his

sister and assistant mary those two would listen to
his tale of discovery how he wished mary was with
him now well another month and she would be with
him always his wife and helpmate he could see her
now the laughing eyes tilted nose puckered lips she
was fair to look upon his mary but wiry and strong
and behind that clear brow was a brain which made her
fit sister to one scientist and wife to another

  well to work again he sighed and continued the
search for living worlds

alcoreth heaved herself in long undulations that
caused a plashing of luminous vibration in the
surrounding ether for alcoreth was hungry eons
of slow starvation stretched everlastingly ahead al-
ready huge vacuoles were dotting her interior as the
plasmic matter shrank and shrivelled away the food
supply was disappearing-no more did rocky crags of
green arid purple hue rise above alcoreths bosom
only the inner core of minerals remained-and that was
wearing dangerously thin over vast subalcorethean fires

  never to be forgotten was that frightful time when
questing for food to still the retching hunger she had
greedily absorbed too large a section of life reaching
bottom rock and torn through the thin layer

  in an instant the devastating flames had leaped and
seared through the protoplasmic tissue the very
thought of it caused vast shudders to course through
alcoreth for ages the hellish fire spewed and roared-
devouring incinerating--bringing the tortures of the
damned to her viscid frame in agony she heaved and
twisted but to no avail her sister spheres gazed on in
helpless pity but could render no aid that final period
-when annihilation seemed imminent-and almost wel-
come-a slipping of the rocky substratum had miracu-
lously closed the gap and once again imprisoned the
ravaging fires slowly painfully and with difficulty
alcoreth recreated sufficient plasma to cover the
wounded surfaces but her marvelous powers of re-
production were lessened since that fateful time she
only nibbled gingerly at the food rocks and the paigs
of hunger grew and grew

  message after message for assistance was sent on
ethereal vibration to her sister spheres in that vast uni-
verse and ever and anon some being kindlier than the
rest would disrupt a fragment of the precious mineral
and cast it meteor-like through space towards the starv-
ing world but these were mere sops alcoreth fore-
saw the inevitable already had protoplasmic worlds
come to the end of their food supply and either broken
through to the central fires and flamed through space
like blazing torches to imponderable dust or cannibal-
like devoured their own substance-until the last pitiful
bit of plasmic intelligence curled up on itself and died

  alcoreth was determined to avoid either of these
fates but how for an eon her highly developed in-
telligence diffused throughout her structure brooded
over the problem speculatively she vibrated in unison
with the etheric waves from the galaxy of the milky
way of which earth was so minute a member a
quiver ran through her-causing a strange luminescence
to run riot over the surface of her body the solu-
tion was found-desperate fantastic-failure meant
annihilation-but then so eventually did the present
state so alcoreth set to work to do what was needful
for the great adventure

  in this strange universe electrons and protons had

whirled just as naturally into the rhythmic forms of life
-protoplasm-primitive plasm as in our universe they
had danced into the common rocks and minerals here
the first bits of plasma were casual in their beginnings
taking sustenance out of the abundant mineral elements
slowly and laboriously evolving and growing more and
more complex through differentiation of structure and
function and culminating in highly complex man there
the cooling mist of electrons patterned overwhelmingly
into diffused plasm with enough of other elements to
crate a normal food supply each world was a living
entity there was no necessity for differentiation of
parts intelligence was inherent and diffused throughout
the entire mass just as is found in the primitive uni-
cellular animals and plants on earth

  the early forms of terrestrial life were able to absorb
and digest mineral matter directly in the universe of
andromeda evolution had advanced further in that di-
rection solid rock was ingested and digested rapidly
and easily through the eons of time the vast inchoate
consciousness of the mass developed into a highly en-
ergized intelligence that could grasp intuitively problems
far beyond our highest flights-and could communica-
cate with other life-worlds by etheric vibrations mental
states were marked by tremendous luminosity over the
surface of the plasma which in turn set the ether into
rapid vibration

  alcoreth was busily at work all over her body she
was rolling up into globules of protoplasm the sur-
faces of these hardened into cell walls or cysts al-
coreth was now disassociated into countless trillions of
spores-as we call them each spore was in itself a unit
of life in a state of suspended animation capable of
resisting the frigid cold of space capable of existing
thus through countless ages and expanding into life
anew under favorable conditions

  clerk-maxwell the great english physicist toward the
latter part of the nineteenth century proved that light
had a definite propulsive force and that particles of
matter if minute enough could be propelled through
the ether with tremendous velocities by the electro-
magnetic rays of light svante august arrhenius the
eminent swedish scientist used this discovery as a basis
for bold speculation was it not possible-he argued-
for minute spores of life to pass through interstellar
space from world to world and germinate anew on bar-
ren uninhabited worlds

  all this alcoreth knew as elemental truths if only
some of her spores could land on some far-off world
unaccountably and strangely formed of mineral matter
solely-there to burgeon and grow with lightning-like
rapidity in the midst of such plenty-what a marvelous
rebirth for inherent in each spore was the intelli-
gence of the mass and alcoreth would exist anew in the
alien universe

  finally all was in readiness the time for the perilous
emprise had come the teeming aggregate of spores
concentrated their mighty intelligence they heaved
and swelled weird radiances played over their sur-
faces huge luminous masses propelled themselves into
space cloud after cloud of spore forms tore them-
selves loose and shot forward the tremendous journey
was begun never in all the history of the universe
was there a stranger migration

  criss-crossing the illimitable void were innumerable
light vibrations instantly the spores were scattered in
all directions caught up by onrushing waves carried

along with the speed of light scurrying towards the
uttermost confines of space-time

  on-on-through the illimitable void ages-eons-
thousands and hundreds of thousands of light years-
never ceasing-never slackening in their headlong flight
past mighty suns-past strange planets-past pale
nebulosities-past pallid shapes of interspatial denizens
-past rushing comets with hair afire-past meteors
debris of uncounted worlds-on-on whole universes
waxed great and waned to pin pricks in the darkling
void on on

  the milky way-a bend of light waves past the sun
-the earth planet loomed vast-a gravitational pull was
exerted-and a cloud of spores had reached the end
of their tremendous flight slowly through the warm
air they settled and floated and dropped to the surface
of the atlantic ocean

ssing fishing vessel safe in
port

  lunenbergnova scotia sept th ap
the fishing smack ellen morse two weeks past due
docked here this morning with a record catch the ves-
sel was blown off its course during the storm reported
three weeks ago by the remainder of the fleet and on
the abatement of the gale ran into an unusually large
school of haddock  miles off the banks she re-
mained to take advantage of the unexpected good for-
tune all on board are well

  the crew report that during the catch a peculiar
shower composed of small brown globules fell on and
about the vessel as this occurred at the height of the
catch no specimens of the dust were preserved

  the early editions of one or two newspapers that sep-
tember morning of  carried this small squib a
commuter or two traveling long distances having ex-
hausted the headlines the sport pages the stock reports
read it then it passed into the oblivion which awaits
all such space filling items no sixth sense no intui-
tional alarm bell warned any reader of the horror
which this dust cloud so casually observed had brought
to earth

  only in the mt wilson observatory did one man
start on reading the report standish alone in all the
world saw here more than a mere unusual occurrence
and even he could place ne great stress on it a care-
ful clipping of the two inch account a reference to data
jotted down a few weeks before then the clipping and -
the few notes in that neat scientific script were filed
away

  it was a fair world that the dust cloud had entered
all the nations were at peace and had been for twenty
years the great strides in mechanical and scientific
progress of the first two decades of the th century had
somewhat slowed down not yet had the commerce
of the world taken to the air while swift passenger
and mail services across the continents and the seas
had become commonplace as yet aerial navigation had
not been cheapened sufficiently to remove from the sur-
face the carrying of freight the life-blood of the na-
tions the foodsuffs the textiles the myriad varied com-
ponents of commerce still coursed in the old arteries
along the surface of the seas still were the harbors of
the world crowded with shipping still across the seven
seas plodded in the old slow way the gleaming freight-
liners and the tramps still across the continents
streamed the long freight-trains mile-long caravans

bearing ore coal grain machinery food and raiment
that the race might be fed and be clothed that man
might be housed kept warm might live and work

  the year  was ushered out in the age-old flare
of horns and carousal the age-old watch-night prayers
and the fateful twelve-month of  began again a
newspaper item noted by but few signalled the approach
of horror

  new york-april rd-the hardin line officers
here report that yesterday afternoon while their private
radio station was receiving the routine daily report
from the hardin freighter ulysses communication sud-
denly ceased and could not be reestablished at the time
the ulysses was  miles due east of cape hatteras
vessels in the vicinity have been requested to investi-
gate

  thus it began the ulysses was never heard of again
other ships cruising over the position from which it was
last reported could find no trace of the freighter nor
any of the usual evidences of marine disaster ten
thousand tons of steel and wood thousands of tons of
freight one hundred men had disappeared without trace

  a month later another great ship broke suddenly off
in the midst of a wireless dialogue and vanished as com-
pletely as though it had never been in quick succession
a third a fourth a fifth abrupt vanishment caught the
attention of the world within a week no longer was
the news relegated to the inside pages of the daily
papers but glaring front page headlines broadcasted the
tidings of disaster marine insurance rose to ex-
orbitant rates the navies of the earth were scouring
the atlantic only the most essential traffic was proceed-
ing at last the world was aware that something
brooded out there in the ocean which threatened the
very life-blood of the earth

  one peculiar feature of the disappearances was early
noted the tragedies had occurred in no localized region
of the ocean plotted on the maps which now appeared
on the front page of every paper it was seen that a
broad belt of waters extending from nova scotia on
the north to the caribbean on the south was dotted with
the black crosses of disaster it was as if some tre-
mendous power was erecting a fearful barrier across
north and south atlantic a barrier which would end the
commerce of the centuries between the eastern and the
western hemispheres saying to the trade of the world
thou shalt not pass

  and now indeed the barrier was complete so rapid
had been the multiplication of casualties that by the end
of june over a thousand vessels had unaccountably van-
ished on july  a general order was issued by the
admiralties of every nation forbidding all commercial
traffic across the atlantic supplies of food and other
necessities were routed across the pacific across asia
and europe to england and the seacoast countries of
the old world now on the broad expanse of the at-
lantic unwonted quiet reigned broken only by the gray
war-craft searching searching for what they knew not

  a pall of horror overspread the world the sole topic
of conversation on the street in business places and in
homes was the mysterious barricade across the ocean and
speculation as to its cause in the capitals of the world
the heads of governments conferred about nothing else
in the universities in the headquarters of the scientific
organizations theory and counter-theory were spun
as to the nature of this thing which had paralyzed com-
merce the attention of all the earth was centered on

the great radio towers and the word that came through
them from the gray war vessels out on the tossing
waters searching searching ever searching for the
thing which so swiftly so relentlessly swallowed up the
great vessels and small which ploughed the waves

  ever there was the same news each day the tale
was-battleship so and so while reporting all well
at such and such time ceased communication other
vessels in the vicinity have been ordered to investigate
and then one by one the other vessels too would
drop out of sight never to be heard of again

  on the newspaper maps it was noted that the belt
of black crosses widened and lengthened extending
ever closer to the shores of the atlantic and the
horror deepened-blacker was the dread of the people

on the thirty-first of july the first faint intimation
of the nature of the menace reached the world
the united states naval station at arlington reported
that while in communication with the u s s texas
it had received the following messages

  from nxl lat-long- a m july  

  first officer reports iridescence covering entire sur-
face of ocean to east and extending north and south as
far as horizon we are proceeding closer

  from nxl lat-long- a m july  
-are now nearing iridescence it is sweeping toward
us-

  here communication ceased the texas had joined
the long list of missing ships

  hurriedly summoned into radio conference the scien-
tists of the work discussed this meagre report a veri-
table babel of conflicting ideas of fine-spun theories of
concepts old and new wove back and forth across the
ether

  the least regarded explanation of the phenomena the
most derided was the exposition by the astronomer of
mt wilson of his theory of an invasion of protoplasm
in spore form

  in the streets of the cities wild-eyed ranters appeared
at every corner to excited pallid crowds they raved
of the judgment of god upon an evil world of the
second coming of christ or buddha or mohammed
of the end of the earth as yet only those whose in-
telligence was of the lowest took stock in their dire
predictions but hysteria with staring eyes and wind-
tangled hair strained at the chains with which civiliza-
tion had bound her

  the world will long remember the morning of august
th  when the full nature of the menace burst
upon it all that had passed before paled into insignifi-
cance at the startling news from florida that state of
palms and oranges that winter playground of the idle
rich no longer exists but its name will long remain
in the minds of man as the region where first the menace
came upon the land

  baking in the glare of the august sun terrifically hot
though still but an hour above the horizon a small group
waited on the platform of the ramshackle station of st
nicholas a few miles inland southern railway sched-
ules were proverbially elastic and thus little thought was
given to the fact that it was a full half hour past the
time when the west-bound number  should have
made its appearance the station-master baggage-man
telegrapher porter etc had reported that the wires
were down to the east but this was a none too rare oc-
currence the talk was of course of the vacant atlantic
the menace from andromeda



for now even the searching warships had been with-
drawn-and the horror which had cleared it of ship-
ping

   its my idee quoth the village druggist who was
on his way to jacksonville for his monthly buying trip
its my idee that the germans are gonna start another
war and theyve got millyuns of submarines out there
if i was president-what the heck is that up the
track

   the oracular dictum was interrupted by the appear-
ance to the east of a hand-car on the rails traveling at
the uttermost speed of which this conveyance was
capable it was being operated by one man and his
frantic heaving at the pump handle gave evidence of
more than ordinary haste the four-wheeled platform
fairly flew along the steel pathway-jingo neddy hes
clippin it some who is it kin you make out  its
bob the agent at pablo beach-musta been a wreck
whats he yellin

   there was time for but a few startled observations
when the hand car had already reached the station its
operator pale disheveled staring with panic shaking
in an ague of fear was shouting runrun its coming
all gone all gone wiped out oh my god get im
all out run run

   that fateful morning of august th the little town of
pablo beach one of the many which once dotted the
east coast of florida just waking to another day of
toil had been overwhelmed by a tremendous mass of
quivering jelly suddenly heaving itself out of the ocean
it was higher than the biggest house in town and it
stretched along the shore as far as i could see it
quivered like jelly and it rolled-it rolled on up the
beach and over the houses and the people everybody
run toward it at first only me and i would have only
number  was due and i had to stick by my key
everyone run toward it ajjd it just rolled on and over
them it peared to move slow but it must have been
coming fast cause when the folks started to run away
from it it just kind of sent out part of itself a bit
faster and it caught them god it was terrible just
before i grabbed the hand-car and got away it caught
pop saunders the postmaster i saw-it catch him it
just kind of heaved and swallowed him up i saw
him inside of it just like a fly in calfs foot jelly just
as clear with his mouth open and his eyes staring
and his legs kicking and his arms working but his kick-
ing and squirming didnt bother the thing any and then
his face kind of run together till it was just a blotch-
and thats all i saw

  in london in berlin and paris men stopped their
midday occupations to read aghast the story of the
florida station-agent in new york boston and
baltimore the wheels of industry never started that
day as the office workers the laborers and the corpora-
tion presidents were halted on their way to their days
occupations by the diead tale sleeping denver and
frisco waked to nightmare terror by the shouting of the
extras in the streets

  in the mt wilson observatory donald standish
keeping his sleepless vigil at the eyepiece of his beloved
telescope was startled by the ringing of the emergency
news bell on the broadcast receiver in a corner hur-
riedly switching on the speaker he heard the terrible
tale gosh i was right

  the stars were forgotten now standish joined the
world in anxious waiting for the hext report it came

  u s news service bulletin -the governor of
florida has mobilized the militia and troops are already
moving rapidly toward pablo beach federal aid has
been called for the secretary of war has ordered all
available regulars with railroad artillery flame-throwers
and gas projection apparatus to the threatened region
it is confidently expected that all danger will be over
shortly

  u s news service bulletin 

  troops have now arrived within a mile of the in-
fested territory infantry is being deployed armed with
gas bombs and flame throwers the  inch railroad
guns are being prepared for action

  bulletin a

  artillery is now firing high explosive shells into the
advancing mass infantry is rapidly approaching within
range

  u s news service bulletin 

  artillery fire is utterly ineffective its only result
is to hurl great globs of the jelly into air they fall on
the advancing infantry and envelop them the loss is
appalling indescribable scenes of horror are being
witnessed even before the enfolded soldiers cease their
struggles against asphyxiation their forms begin to melt
away they appear to be digested by the jelly the
big guns have been ordered to cease fire the effect of
poison gas which is being released in great clouds is now
being observed

  donald could restrain himself no longer fools he
burst out all their big guns and their gases will
never stop that stuff some scientific method of attack
must be found

  the next bulletin proved him right

  poison gas has no effect flame-throwers wither the
jelly where they reach it but on both sides of each point
of operation the mass continues its relentless march
reports reach us now that the east coast as far north as
charleston has been invaded

  donald burst out again we must find a way to
stop the advance of the jelly and then to kill it per-
haps doug will have a notion he ought to hes been
working with cells long enough ill call him besides
i havent spoken to mary since noon yesterday

  as the astronomer made his way to the personal com-
munications set the call light on that device began to
flash he answered it mt wilson observatory
standish speaking professor standish this is presi-
dent adams office there will be a radio conference of
scientists in half an hour you are requested to listen
in right

  now to get doug rapidly whirling the dials to
camerons wave length

  quickly the connection was completed hello doug
did you get the news  they know now that i was right
what you havent heard might have known nothing
matters to you but your blasted cancer there soon
wont be anybody left for you to save from cancer

get this-

  in quick succinct phrases the savant outlined to
the bacteriologist the tale of horror which was echoing
round the earth he did not get very far however for
an exclamation of horror stopped him as he listened
to the broken phrases of cameron the tanned face of
the astronomer paled with horror his knuckles whitened
with the force of his grip on the receiver

  whats that mary flew to new york yesterday to
get you some pigments man dont you realize that


amazing stories

its a matter of hours till the protoplasm visits new
york get mary back at once

  damnation you cant the radio on her phone
is out of order how was she flying by sight cant
you reach her no then im going after her the
devil with the conference one hair on marys head
is more than the rest of the world to me youll go with
me get ready then ill make it as fast as i can

  in a trice douglas flying suit was on the hangars
doors were opened and the trim little sport plane zoom-
ed up to the  foot speed level then like an arrow
flew to the east

  meanwhile message after message of terror had been
winging its way into the ether all the east coast of
florida southern georgia the carolinas virginia in
rapid succession had seen the creeping iridescent terror
resistlessly out of the sea it was heaving twenty-five
feet high hundreds of miles long this vast jelly-like tide
of destruction it was as if the sea had congealed and
was making a final triumphant drive for mastery over
its eternal enemy the land with the inevitableness of
fate itself the thing rolled up enevloping all that op-
posed it enfolding the shrieking mobs which tried to flee
before it and most horrible of all digesting them

in new york the streets were packed with pale-faced
throngs although every home had its receiver
the desire for the companionship of others had sent the
entire population into the streets the public loud-
speakers the newspaper bulletin boards were the nuclei
of the masses as one item after another of disaster
was broadcast by the news-purveying agencies a groan
would rise from the crowds and then silence would come
again for these were silent crowds the magnitude of
the calamity had stricken the people dumb

  forcing her way through the packed masses and into
the hundred story tower which columbia university
had just occupied was mary cameron astounded on
her arrival by the terrific news of calamity she was
anxiously intent upon completing her errand and speed-
ing her plane back to her brother but tremendous diffi-
culties had delayed her traffic was well-nigh sus-
pended it had taken an enormous bribe to persuade a
taxi-driver to undertake the journey from the governors
island landing field through the vehicular tunnel and up
broadway to the new educational centre in what had
been central park held to a snail-like pace by the
masses which packed the streets from building line to
building line the trip had taken hours but now at
dusk she had reached her goal

  the great building was deserted but the doors of
an elevator stood open and she could operate the simple
mechanism swiftly she rose through the hundred floors
of this latest apotheosis of education to where in the
very tip of the soaring tower camerons home laboratory
was located she unlocked the door and entered the
room quickly dropping her close-fitting cap and leather
flying suit she began to assemble the bottles and jars
listed on the slip which she had brought from the moun-
tain retreat she had left the night before but the strain
of twenty-four hours of flying by sight and of the
terrific scenes she had just witnessed suddenly told on
even her wiry constitution and she dropped into a chair
for a moments rest she closed her eyes-in a moment
she was sound asleep

  startled awake by a roar which ascending from a
thousand feet below rattled the windows with the force

given it by millions of throats she found the room glow-
ing with a green and spectral light the usual murmur
of the great city had changed to a terrific tumult in
which she could sense a terrible agony of fear even at
this alpine height she ran to the window night had
fallen but it was not dark from far below came the
green light a glowing luminescence which reminded her
of some rotting fungus which she had one night found in
the woods near camerons laboratory the glowing ma-
terial made a gridiron there beneath filling the streets
south and west till it merged in sheets of green flame
where she knew the harbor and the rivers lay immedi-
ately beneath her the streets were still clear but bathed in
that unearthly light she could see black streams in
the cupboard she knew her brother had a pair of binocu-
lars quickly getting them she focussed them on the
black streams she saw people thousands tens of thou-
sands rushing north shouting in a frenzy of terror and
there only a little south the glowing green light pouring
up the streets towering far above the hurrying strug-
gling mobs moving with incredible swiftness engulf-
ing the stragglers the menace had reached new york

  she swept the glasses north whence came a rolling as
of thunder far up the sound she could see flashes-the
forts at the upper end of the city were fighting their big
guns south again and below quiet now the glowing
jelly had filled the streets new york was dead

  well im in a fine fix now im safe enough here
but how am i going to get away probably starve to
death well thats better than being swallowed up by
that thing down there

  a terrific crash downtown came to her startled ears
then almost before she could turn another and another
down on the tip of the island where first manhattan
had reached toward the sky there was a clear space
where the -story bank of manhattan building had
been woolworth too was gone and all the mountainous
structures below as she gazed she saw the -story
city hall tower just completed sway then like some
giant of the forest felled after centuries of growth by
the woodmans axe topple over and gathering speed
crash into the lambent sea which bathed its foot as it
struck the surface of the quivering flood of light there
was a tremendous splash and through the air for hun-
dreds of feet flew huge glowing fragments they fell
on the roofs and the serried facades of the buildings for
blocks around and then to marys horror they spread
and wherever the patches of light lay the sturdy struc-
tures of steel and granite began to melt

  good god im not so safe after all the ghastly
stuff eats even the material of which these buildings are
made i wonder how long this place will last i guess
its finish for me

all this time the yellow sport plane had been rush-
ing across the continent sliding down the radio
beacon from new york intent on the path ahead the
two leather clad figures bent over the dashboard no
talk for the muffler had been cut out for greater speed
no talk but the thoughts of the two were identical
whats happening in new york whats happening to
mary is she safe over and over these thoughts
reiterated themselves in the weary brains these two
great scientists in whose intellects lay perhaps the
saving of the world had forgotten everything save that
wisp of a girl in new york sister of one and sweet-
heart of the other
the menace from andromeda



  at last the appalachians appeared passed beneath
them fell away behind them night had come donald
who had yielded his place at the stick to cameron sud-
denly clutched his companions arm and pointed ahead
on the horizon there pulsated a greenish glow stand-
ishs mind flew back to that star in andromeda whose
passing he had watched months before here again he
saw the light whose components he had analyzed in his
gas spectroscope the plane was headed directly for
new york and straight ahead of them the luminescence
was at its brightest

  ten minutes now and they were circling over the
great city from the bay to westchester from the
palisades east to the sea the city was invested as far
north as the ridge of giant erections about nd street
the smooth expanse of the phosphorescent sea told of
the progress of destruction

  cameron reached for the lever which silenced the
roaring exhaust of the twin engines

  if only were in time if only she is still in my lab
im going to go on past the windows and see

  throttled down to its slowest flying speed the little
plane dipped gracefully past the doomed tower rising
high above the glowing rectangle of the park not
twenty feet from the tower it glided and there in the
window which both men sought so eagerly was the
figure they had hardly dared hope would be there

  up again then for consultation doug how close
can we get to that window ill get within a foot or
well all go to hell together then do it and ill get
her out but first tell her what we plan get a flash-
light she knows the morse code remember how i
used to signal her in the old days

  a long slow glide now about  feet away lucky
that your window faces the park cameron obeyed
while the astronomer flashed his dots and dashes on
the sill ready to jump a wave of the brave little hand
signalled understanding then up again

  up to  feet and a mile away then while stand-
ish creeps out to the end of the wing the motor is shut
off and a long glide begun down on a long slant
straight for that pinnacle rising sheer ahead down
ever down with increasing speed hurtles the plane a
miracle of accurate steering another miracle of perfect
timing and sheer muscular strength are required stark
courage from all three or the gallant attempt at rescue
must end in disaster will they can they do it too
near-and a crash too far and a new attempt cannot be
made for see already the great tower sways with
approaching dissolution

  perfect aiming the plane almost grazes the side of
the tower perfect execution-a hundred feet from the
window on whose sill mary stands one hand clinging
to the sash the other outstretched the ship dips then
suddenly rising almost stalls directly opposite the open-
ing perfect timing-the hand of the man on the wing
grips the hand of the girl on the sill a leap a tug and
there are two now on the wing frantically cameron
works at the controls frantically the lovers cling to
the taut surface of the fabric on which they sprawl
overbalanced the craft reels drunkenly then the roar
of the motor the wings grip the air and all is safe

  as cameron zoomed upward the hundred-story uni-
versity rocks in ever-widening arcs then slowly slowly
it begins to fall intact entire as it had for so short
a time soared over the city so it falls slowly at first
then with gradually increasing speed the great structure

falls until with a rush almost too fast for the eye to
follow it crashes into the lucent tide

  into the little cockpit tumble the lovers trembling ex-
hausted with their supreme effort cameron too is
trembling but he must guide the ship with its precious
freight westward now they turn westward through
the horrible night

  and now for the first time they can look about them
and take stock the air is thick with darting planes
fleeing westward from the scourge below them not a
house that is not ablaze with light not a highway that is
not jammed with rushing conveyances not a railroad
which is not crammed with hurrying trains westward
every one looking behind from north to south in the
wide sweep which their height of  feet allowed them
nothing but that terrible spectral green light nothing but
that immense sea not of water but of all-devouring
jelly come across the vast infinity of interstellar space
to harry the earth and conquer it and overhead the
velvet black sky and the stars gleaming still in the wide
arch of the heavens as they did when earth was a whirl-
ing mass as they still shall when this ball is nought but
a cold dead thing

  switch on the communication receiver c lets hear
what the news broadcast says

  u s news service bulletin 

  the entire eastern coasts of north and south
america are now completely covered with the jelly
extent of the investment from ten miles to twenty-five
spain and southern france are being slowly covered
the rest of the western coast of europe penetrated only
from a mile to five

  u s news service bulletin 

  the scientific conference is still in session no solu-
tion has as yet been arrived at but the chairman wishes
to announce that the people of the earth need not de-
spair progress is being made donald standish the
noted astronomer is still unaccountably missing it is
requested that any one having information as to his pres-
ent location communicate at once with  ag the gov-
ernment intelligence station

  mary turned to donald in whose arms she was still
being tightly held oh don why did you leave your
post for me the world needs you why did you leave
it for me

  dear if you had gone the rest of the world could
have followed for all of me but now now that youre
safe we must get back ive got a hunch that doug
and i together can arrive at the right thing to do we
cant land now once down in that mob wed never be
able to take off again besides neither of us can think
straight just yet too much has happened in the last
thirty hours well soon be home now and well get
busy drive her doug

  now the sunhad overtaken them and a new day was
begun close ahead rose the peaks of the rockies
among them the mountain on which perched camerons
wilderness laboratory a long spiral and the little ship
of the air dropped gently on the landing field at its door

  the passengers debarked stiffly from the flight plane
then douglas taxied it into the hangar emerging
promptly the three of them entered the house

physically exhausted as they were by the long
journey there was yet no thought of sleep they
were still shaking with the horror of those frightful
scenes they had so recently witnessed


amazing stories

  mary was tottering with weariness but held herself
bravely not for worlds would she permit her lover
to see how near the verge of hysteria she was now that
the danger was past she looked around the long com-
fortable room-cheery fireplace and all-with a shudder
how peaceful and quiet everything was-and over there
-nameless horrors out of hell-the indescribable
stampede of maddened humanity-the hideous screech
of some poor devil engulfed in the advancing monster-
no no-that way lay madness-she must stop

  donald was watching her anxiously mary you
must get some sleep at once

  im all right-just a little attack of nerves she
smiled wanly dont trouble yourself about me i
want to help too

  well puzzle this out ourselves and when you wake
if weve evolved any ideas well let you in on it now
be a good girl and go to bed havent you something
soothing in your lab he turned to douglas

  cettainly just the thing for you mary douglas
went to the cupboard and poured out a small tumbler
full of a pale liquid just drink this down and youll
slide so smoothly into the arms of morpheus the next
thing youll know the birds will be twittering in the trees
here you are take it

  mary looked at them both for a moment-saw the
worry in their eyes and capitulated all right boys
if you insist though im sure i can be of help she
drank the potion and retired to her bedroom

  the two men filled their pipes and settled back in
their chairs their bodies were poisoned with fatigue
but their brains were racing keenly for a while they
smoked in silence gratefully inhaling the fragrant
fumes

  standish was the first to break the silence

  as you know doug i have a theory that accounts
for this demoniac visitation but when i sprang it on
the conference i was laughed at for my pains

  douglas looked at him keenly he knew his chum
and knew that he was not given to hazarding wild
hypotheses unless they contained a solid substratum of
truth

  go over it again he said quietly i promise to
listen with an open mind

  donald launched again into his tale-the strange liv-
ing star in the island universe-its explosive disintegra-
tion into space-the queer dust cloud of tiny globules
reported by the fishing smack-followed by the ap-
pearance of this horrible amorphous life-mass that was
threatening to engulf the earth

  cameron listened intently thoughtfully he drummed
with his fingers on the arm of his chair he too was
familiar with the hypotheses of clerk-maxwell and ar-
rhenius 

  there is a good deal of plausibility about your
theory he acknowledged thoughtfully and it accounts
also for the vast proliferating powers of this monstrous
mass-no life as we know it on this planet could even
approximate the uncanny speed of its growth nor have
our primitive life-forms the ability to subsist on in-
organic matter to quite the extent that it has again
absently drumming on his chair

  he relapsed into brooding thought standish looked
at his friend but forebore to say anything when cam-
eron was on the verge of something brilliant he always
drummed so the astronomer waited

  the break was not long in coming douglas brow

suddenly cleared-a look of triumph gleamed in his eye

  by george i have it he almost shouted i be-
lieve your fantastic story old man and im going to rid
the world of this menace listen to me for a moment
you have my closest attention

  suppose we assume the truth of your hypotheses
then this living world moving in the andromeda uni-
verse shining by its own luminosity separated by un-
thinkable distances from any hot gaseous star would
naturally be accustomed only to the faint starlight of
the heavens no such blaze of light as even our ordi-
nary sunlight ever came within its ken now youve
heard of phototropism 

standish nodded his head but his friend went on
heedlessly absorbed in the plan maturing in his mind

  its the reaction of protoplasm to light he ex-
plained if you take any unicellular animal like the
amoeba and expose it to a strong light it will shrink
away from the source of the light and try to get out of
its path if you use a powerful ray of concentrated
ultra-violet light-the reaction will be much more ap-
parent-the amoeba will literally run for its life-and
if exposed long enough to the rays will die

  now if we can obtain such drastic results with life
forms inured and habituated by constant exposure to
the suns rays continually beating upon our planet what
about this alien protoplasmic mass unaccustomed to
strong light of any kind and no doubt feeling irritable
even during our normal sunshine

  standish sat up excitedly he was beginning to
catch the drift of camerons reasoning 

  douglas went on my plan is this have the nations
of the world concentrate their technicians and engineers
in the power plants and factories most remote from the
menace construct huge searchlights of the utmost
candle power and machines for casting enormous
beams of ultra-violet light in the meantime have the
people of the areas endangered by the billowing march
of the monster retreat to the mountain fastnesses that
can be done fairly easily-its progress from all reports
is approximately ten to fifteen miles a day when all
is in readiness mount our machines on tractors and
drive them in front of the encroaching fiend when it
comes within striking distance turn on the juice full
blast the power will come by tuned radio waves from
the power plants operating in the hinterland if our
theories are correct on the impact of our rays the viscid
mass will react much more violently than an amoeba
or paramecium would retreat would be all it would
think of and the more exposed masses would be killed
off in that way we could get rid of the menace or at
least drive it back into the ocean by following it
steadily all the way

  standish got up in enthusiasm and rung camerons
hand boy youre a wizard thats a marvelous
scheme youll be the savior of the world

  hold on a moment douglas smiled protestingly it
may work and it may not remember im basing my
scheme on your hypotheses

  itll work all right retorted donald confidently
and now i know im right too

  dont run away so fast warned the bacteriologist
remember at the best we shall only have managed to
drive it back to the ocean once there we can do no
more there in the vast depths of the sea with what
we know of the rapidity of its procreation it will once
more overwhelm the world
the menace from andromeda



  douglas groaned there you go-get me all excited
and then you let me down i forgot that part so
whats the good of your swell scheme 

  ah but i have something else up my sleeve
grinned his companion you know of course that ive
been working my head off trying to find a cure for
cancer i havent succeeded as yet-though the out-
look is promising but in the course of my researches
ive invented a technique for excising cancer growths
from the living organism and growing them indepen-
dently in special culture media i have also discovered a
method of activating them so that when replaced
in living tissues they will multiply with unbelievable
rapidity at present i have on hand here in the labora-
tory about fifty pounds of activated cancer cultures and
that is sufficient for my purpose

  now to get back to your theory again if this visi-
tation is in truth from an alien world it is highly im-
probable that it was ever exposed to the disease of can-
cer if that is so then it lacks whatever immunity our
life has obtained through constant exposure and the
cancer cells will spread like wildfire through the whole
vast organism-and this malign influence will- be eradi-
cated from the face of the earth

  man i repeat-youre a wizard the astronomer
pumped his hand violently then an idea struck him
but why not spray it with cancer immediately-why
bother with ultra-violet light to drive it into the depths
of the sea

  because explained douglas patiently cancer is no
respecter of persons and once let loose on land it is
liable to spread to all forms of earth life and we shall
only have succeeded in destroying ourselves too in the
ocean however the range is sharply limited-we shall
instruct the people of the earth to remain inland until
the danger is passed once killed the whole mass will
descend to the floors of the seas and there the cold and
pressure will destroy the cancerous tissues

  youve thought of everything was the admiring
retort

  now to get into immediate communication with the
conference chairman and unfold our plan

  right-theres not a moment to lose the fate of the
world is in the balance

  in a few minutes the radio transmitter was sputtering
out the code call signal of the conference a lapse of
five minutes and word came back radio emergency
conference talking-what is it

  standish sending from the laboratory of cameron in
colorado plan for combating menace has been evolved
please connect me with the chairman then for a
solid hour across the ether vibrated the saving word

  back came the answer sounds all right our last
hope anyway broadcasting immediately to all the na-
tions to mobilize tractor searchlights ultra-violet ap-
paratus united states will mobilize on eastern length
of appalachian within twenty-four hours both of you
report for service immediately at allentown pa last
reports show inundation extended as far as scranton
signing off

  we need some sleep-lets snatch a few hours-and
start suggested standish

  righto we can get there in fifteen hours well need
only an hour or two for assembling our material here
that gives us plenty of time for a snooze

  almost instantaneously both were sleeping-drugged

hen they awoke it was dusk mary was still
asleep-a peaceful smile flitting over her lips
donald looked at her tenderly lets not disturb her
poor girl-she has been through hell he brushed
her forehead lightly with his lips and the smile grew
into ecstacy but still she did not awaken

  now to work

  they hurried into the laboratory standish opened
the door of a huge glass-lined oven thermostatically
controlled at blood heat in the interior were twenty
or more glass dishes each containing a mass of tissue
floating in culture media

  these are my cancer growths he explained they
will live indefinitely in the cultures now to activate
them so that when we cast them into the protoplasmic
horror they will grow and proliferate with extreme
rapidity

  he turned to a row of glass stoppered bottles on his
laboratory shelf and took one down it was filled with
a pale green liquid carefully with a pipette he drop-
ped five drops into each dish a slight bubbling ensued
-and then ceased

  bring that cabinet in the corner over here he
ordered and all the cotton wool you find in the end
cupboards

  the cabinet was opened-a layer of cotton placed on
the bottom-the cancer dishes placed carefully between
layers of the soft material and then the whole affair
hermetically sealed

  now were ready to go

  the two men quickly and silently donned their flying
suits and in short order the plane was trundled out of
the hangar the cabinet was carefully lifted into the
cockpit and they took their seats the motor roared
and the plane took off on its flight across the continent

  next morning as the first rays of dawn appeared
over the serried tops of the alleghany mts the hag-
gard wearied travelers descended stiffly from their plane
after landing on the air field outside allentown

  for a moment they gazed about them in dazed as-
tonishment the place was seething with activity hun-
dreds of planes were landing on all sides tractors were
lumbering and roaring over the field soldiers and vast
crowds of workmen swarmed in organized disorder

  where is the commander asked donald of a big
burly sergeant actively engaged in expending a stream
of profanity at a company of men unpacking a huge
searchlight

  over there he jerked a thumb over his shoulder
toward the hangar at one end of the field without deign-
ing to turn around and with hardly a pause in his flow
of lurid objurgations

  come on doug lets report at once and see what
we can do	

  at the door they gave their names to the guard and
were ushered in immediately

  seated at a rough pine board table hastily built to
function as a desk was general black grizzled veteran
of the world war now commander-in-chief of all the
american armies officers dashed in-came to stiff
salute-reported in staccato accents-received their
orders even more crisply-and dashed out again a field
radio receiving set whined the general put the phone
to his ear whats that-only thirty miles away all
right-report every fifteen minutes on its progress

  turning around he saw the two scientists yes
what is it  make it snappy


amazing stories

  they introduced themselves and the generals attitude
became more cordial

  i hope your ideas are correct-if not were all
doomed he sighed frankly im not used to this
sort of thing-out of my line artillery-machine-guns
-gas-yes but not this new-fangled stuff

  however well soon find out he continued grimly
my air scouts report it as only thirty miles away at
the rate it is traveling it will be here in forty-eight hours
well be ready for it in about thirty-six hours-and
then- he shrugged fatalistically in the meantime
ill get some quarters for you and you can make your-
selves comfortable until were ready to start he
turned to an orderly and soon the scientists were in-
stalled in a barrack-like room-their plane with its
precious freight wheeled into the hangar and placed
under guard

  the next thirty-six hours were filled with feverish ac-
tivity all through the day and night tractors kept com-
ing in-apparatus and the requisite machines were de-
posited from planes - railroads-automobiles - every
conceivable method of transportation

  in the meantime the radio reports were becoming
more and more alarming inexorably the living tide
was moving forward-swallowing everything in its
path twenty miles away-fifteen miles-activity be- 
came frantic-ten miles-five miles-the last feverish
touches-and all was in readiness for the supreme effort

  as far as the eye could see stretched serried ranks of
tractors along the whole appalachian range thousands
of tractors were ready to go at the signal of command
on each was perched a powerful searchlight or violet
ray machine capable of casting directional beams over
a ten-mile radius the final orders were given-every-
one not directly concerned in the management of the ap-
paratus was sent to the rear

  it was the zero hour

  already in the distance the horizon was glowing with
the dreaded greenish light-the vast menace was flowing
-flowing forward

  a hush fell on the embattled array could they stop
it-was it victory or disaster  the bravest among them
felt clammy hands clutching their hearts

  the radio command roared its voice along the far-
flung line the motors roared-the current snapped on
-and a blaze of light-intense-penetrating-flared out
up and down the line another command-and the trac-
tors moved forward-slowly-steadily a ten-mile zone
of intense illumination-blinding in its glare-moved
ahead it approached the green luminescence still the
monstrous life flowed forward

  nerves tensed to the snapping points-blood pounded
in thousands of hearts-god-would it have no effect-
the life of the planet hung on the next few moments

  the wall of light reached the oncoming wall of alien
life-touched it-overlapped it-swung over the top and
over its viscous waves only three miles separated the
opposing forces

  was it a delusion did they see aright a rustling
murmur grew on the scene-a confused babel of voices
-and then-a mighty shout blasted the air-a pean of
deliverance-the world was saved

  the oncoming mass had definitely ceased moving-
the front reared high into the air-writhing and twisting
as though in agony-and then-recession-slow at first
-then faster and faster the monster was in full re-
treat-vainly seeking to escape the deadly rays

  immediately the jubilant army moved forward-ever
concentrating the dazzling light on the discomfited foe
who thought of food-or sleep or stopping-back into
the sea with the monster for two days and a night the
front of war advanced-steadily the enemy was driven
back-remorselessly as ever it had advanced-agonized
writhing before the avenging glare once more the
face of the earth appeared-but strange alien in aspect
-more like some desolate moon aridly moving through
space than this fair smiling world of ours no trees-
no houses- no verdure was left the very surface of the
earth was eroded away-pitted and scarred with deep
holes and gullies through which the tractors floundered
and pitched

  back-back through the ruin of what had once been
new york-into the sea it was driven-and the world
was temporarily saved from overwhelming disaster

from all the endangered nations came the glad tid-
ings of complete triumph everywhere the crawl-
ing life had been forced into the waters

  wild celebrations took place among the people of the
earth the names of cameron and standish were broad-
cast to the joyful millions as the saviors of humanity

  but the menace was by no means over-though tem-
porarily subdued orders were issued that no one was
to approach within ten miles of the seaboards and the
armies of the world were placed on sentry duty to see
that the orders were enforced

  at a conference at pittsburgh the temporary capital of
the united states douglas cameron told of his dis-
coveries in cancer research his activating principle and
outlined his plan of scattering the tissues of cancer into
the floating masses of protoplasm he was listened to
with the most flattering attention when he finished
president adams arose and grasped his hand and then
that of his co-worker

  gentlemen he said his voice quivering with emo-
tion you have already placed the world under an in-
calculable debt of gratitude to you if you succeed in
your present undertaking and rid the earth of this
frightful scourge your names will go ringing down the
ages as long as life exists on this planet i have placed
at your service a cruiser of our air fleet fully manned
and provisioned for a cruise of ten thousand miles go
and god bless you

  they bowed their thanks and left the meeting in
less than an hour they were seated in the cabin of the air
cruiser with their precious cabinet at their feet-the
crew sprang smartly to their posts-and they took to the
air

  the coast was reached in slightly over an hour and
they soon were winging their way out to sea

  the captain came into the cabin for instructions
drop to within five hundred feet of the water and
have your crew on the look-out for any traces of the
beast have the first one to sight it sing out

  it shall be done and he retired the great plane
glided down and whirled over the surface of the ocean
all eyes were strained in eager search

  a shout from an excited lookout

  the things directly below sir all hands rushed
to the side sure enough-the surface of the ocean to
the east was heaving and tossing-a weird green light
flickered and flared-the sea crawled with the shiny
evil thing

  quickly cameron opened his cabinet and gingerly re-
the menace from andromeda



moved one of the dishes carrying it to the side with
one quick scoop he ladled out the contents and threw it
overboard down it spattered into the jellied mass-
scourge set to fight scourge

  for two days the plane cruised over the broad at-
lantic dropping the seeds of destruction into the bosom
of the visitation when the last dishful had been dis-
patched on its errand the cruiser turned homeward its
work was done the rest was in the lap of fate

  the people of the earth waited in deep anxiety men
of science-great biologists-broadcast learned opinions
to the listening multitudes

  daily clouds of speedy pursuit planes were flung over
the broad bosom of the atlantic to observe and report
daily they reported no signs of disappearance if any-
thing the areas of infestations seemed to be actually in-
creasing once more fear reared its hideous head-if
the cancerous growths proved ineffectual-it was only a
question of time before the horrible thing would once
more approach the shores

  but ten days later an observation plane reported

the

seeing hard fibrous growths like huge warts covering
the surface in one area then in quick succession other
reports came in the cancer had commenced its deadly
work within a month the ocean was covered with
dead cancerous masses-the menace was a thing of the
past slowly they heaved on the ocean tides and slowly
they sank beneath the waves the earth was free of its
hideous nightmare the race was saved

	 

   on a mild october morning a little group filed into
the rustic church near the laboratory a little group-
but every broadcast receiver every television screen
was attuned to the waves which were carrying each
sound and sight in that church to every corner of the
globe all the people of the earth joined in a prayer for
good fortune for the couple whose wedding rites were
being celebrated there and as mary cameron became
mary standish all the earth joined in the hymn which
welled out in a mighty chorus of thanksgiving whose
echoing vibrations must have been heard even in far
distant andromeda

  now said chick davis when the tow ropes were

the laughing death

           continued from page 

the edge of the cliff a pale sunlight is flooding over a
world of fire and smoke and ugly unseeing mon-
strosities some street lamps still drawing on the
power that has come all these years from one of the
imprisoned metal worms waver into life again glowing
dimly in all that vast blackness and ruin like toy candles

  the air is rent with the growls snarls and the night
awakening of the animal population roaming at will
over the sad remains of the city the earths four-
footed creatures alone have escaped the effects of the
green vapor i reach for the rifle that is ever at hand
as a low ululation reaches me with bloodcurdling dis-
malness and i raise my rifle to my shoulder as a wild
unearthly shriek of laughter comes down from the
heights and sends a chill up and down my spine i aim

at the hyena which has somehow reached a dizzy perch
on one of the tottering skyscrapers and finding itself
imprisoned by some chance fall of masonry is leading
a solitary existence devouring the bodies of such hapless
victims as had been unable to escape from the building
however i do not fire for i have wasted my shells
before and in vain

  with one last look into the blackness i wonder where
the mad fiend grubsnig is and then i look up at the
second earth with a sad longing look and think of my
friend joel murch as my eyes grow dim with frank
tears will i ever see him again will i ever write
a satisfactory conclusion to this very unsatisfactory his-

editor amazing stories

  i was more than a little interested in the
editorial for january  the story of
motors for the reason that i am an automotive
engineer by profession and your remarks on
heat engines are as fundamental as carnots
cycle but i have not seen the principles of heat
engines enunciated so clearly in any popular
magazine until now

  your remarks about the waste caused by cool-
ing cylinders while true may be a trifle mis-
leading be assured that this waste is not of the
engineers choice if they could they would cer-
tainly run their internal combustion engines at
temperatures of - degrees and even
higher but no lubricant would stand that nor
any metal if the chemists of whom you are a
distinguished member will give us a metal and
a lubricant to stand extreme heat we engineers
will quickly build a motor to squeeze evrry possi-
ble bit of energy out of the fuel and make you
rich too

  speaking of the second law of thermodynamics
that is the reason for high compression motors-
the difference in temperature between the explosion
point and exhaust point of the stroke the com-
pression ratio governs here not the ratio of
bore to stroke etc we also save heat by run-
ning a motor fast the heat has less time to
escape from the hot gases to the cylinder walls
instead of passing off it expends itself in the
expansion of the gases

  but i could write a whole book on this subject
and i do not mean to dispute your remarks about
rocket motors the simplest and potentially the
most efficient heat engines the only heat engine
that does not lose efficiency at extreme high speeds

  now i have taken your remarks on my profes-
sion with the good nature you intended may i
say a few words about your business the editing
of a magazine reading your reactions to
readers letters i think that you must rather feel
resentful at critics this is only human but i

hope you will know that my remarks and sugges-
tions are those of a sincere friend and steady
reader of amazing stories which i consider to
be at least equal to the average of scientifiction
should you be tolerant enough to print my sug-
gestions ill be greatly interested in whatever
you might wish to add and ill see it because
no matter where i am sent by the company i can
always buy amazing stories even in small
towns

  via the time accelerator by frank bridge
the best story in the january number i can
find no fault with the science of this story unless
you get right down to narrow facts which would
disqualify about  per cent of all scientifiction
because bridge looks to me like a comer let
me commend to him that he study the more fin-
ished style of the professional writers who write
for other magazines via the time accelerator
was about  spoiled by the slow and amateurish
start the first page is nothing but pointless
conversation irritating to the busy reader page
two is a mess of cockeyed mathematics about the
theory of time travel that does not convince and
does not explain how brockhurst is going to put
it to work except something vague about the vi-
bration of particles as vibration itself must be
expressed in terms of time so many oscillations
per second the whole thing makes nothing but
nonsense it is pseudoscientific gibberish also
contrary to known fact matter except at absolute
zero is known to vibrate changing the rate
of vibration simply changes the etheric radiation
of that body whether that radiation be merely
heat or in the case of extremely rapid vibrations
light so the time machine as described would
merely have het up its inventor and his plane
the same as if he sat on a hot stove all right
you use up two and a half pages getting started
and the story gets down to business about the
middle of page  from then it is good with
some new ideas in it now if the author had
started like say r f starzl in the globoid
terror in a recent number with a tense situ-
ation right at the start and followed it up with
fast action right along he would have had a

story as good as the globoid terror which is
quite a recommendation i agree with the reader
from oklahoma who says starzl always presents
real science every astronomer will tell you that
conditions on venus north pole are probably
just as described in the globoid terror min-
ing there would have to be done just as described
yet most writers make venus a good deal like the
earth

  the prince of space by jack williamson
well thought out and original though a little
hard to get started the rocket torpedoes are
something new in weapons after so many tire-
some rays but the love stuff between paula and
the prince was unnecessary in such a story as
this it will make a lot of readers say no love
stuff when really they have no objection to real
love interest if it has something to do with the
story but it could have been left out of this
story without hurting it in the least

  the black hand by charles gardner bowers
if it was possible to graft a black arm on a white
man why wasnt it possible to graft a white skin
on the black arm

  tanks under the sea harl vincent par-
don me but it was punk

  the act of retipuj by samuel garfinkel
well it was somewhat better

  the drums of tapajos by capt s p meek
what i read of it was pretty good but i never
follow continued stories

  looking this over it looks pretty severe to me
and in extenuation let me point out that i still
think a s is good enough to spend my quarter
for every month while this will probably irritate
you before you throw it into the wastebasket
think it over anyway there may be other
readers who think the same as i

all for only 

             heres just the book youve been waiting for how
             to make it-wrinkles kinks formulas
             -the complete all-around guide for practically every
             kind of repairing and construction a common-sense
             aid to the man or boy who feels the urge to see use-
             ful finished articles take shape as the combined result
             of skillful hands and brain

  you cannot imagine that what weve said
about the waste in cooling the cylinders of an
internal combustion engine was intended as a
criticism it merely pointed a defect in the in-
ternal combustion engine which it seems it is
impossible to get away from wouldnt it be
curious if some watt of the gas engine could do
for it some of the service that was done by the
original watt for the old-time steam engine your
description of how high speed operates to increase
efficiency was extremely interesting our trouble
about rocket motors is that so many people think
that the resistance of the air to the escaping gas
has to do with the operation and now we wish to
emphasize the fact that we are not resentful to
criticism of course we are only human but
we are of a high enough type of humanity to
accept varied criticism so you must not be afraid
of offending us keep on criticising and your
letters will be quite welcome you see that in
the heading we have called it a valuable letter
we hope mr bridge will take your very severe
criticism in a good natured way harl vincent
of whom you speak so unfavorably is a profes-
sional engineer holding an important position
with one of the great electric companies there
is comfort however in your last paragraph where
you name your favorite authors we are sure
we could add to the number many others and you
would agree with our selection-editor

editor amazing stories

   i have a most unpleasant task before me a
task that i relish only in the fact that it affords
me an opportunity to voice a criticism and to
give you my opinion as to the publication

   i have been a reader of amazing stories for
the past two years and have found it until quite
recently a leader in its field but lately this same
opinion has taken a rather severe drop due
primarily to two things

   one-the eternal question the cover is the
most fantastic thing ever seen although i
realize this feature has great selling properties
it tends to create an impression upon outside
minds as something akin to trash ive in-
terpreted this look upon the faces of many who
look my way when i have the magazine i ask
you in the name of common sense to tone this
feature down a bit and not try to print the
whole book on the cover

  two-regarding the stories some are posi-
tively absurd iu admit some are good but
authors in their search for originality create rank
impossibilities

   i believe when you first published this ftiaga-
zine you had an ideal the ideal to bring science
to the masses not as something almighty nor
god-like but as something symbolizing knowledge
and truth the authors make folly of the word
truth pure science stands as a tribute to the
intellectualism of man and should not be dealt
with lightly and the authors should hold this
science down to logical common sense

   if this letter should ever creep into print im
afraid most of your recruits who hold amazing
stories as a guiding light will resent such
severe criticism and perhaps a good deal of verbal
abuse will be directed my way

   i do like your editorials they are both instruc-
tive and inspiring

   in conclusion i will say with all my heart
that i would like to see amazing stories raised
to a height where it will not be known as trash
but will be praised and read and looked up to
by those who now condemn it

   our covers always show one incident in one
story and there is no attempt to print the whole
book on the cover the question of color draw-
ing and general lay-out is taken into considera-
tion whatever our ideal was when the magazine
was started is expressed on the front page always
we quote extravagant fiction today-r-cold
fact tomorrow so you will realize that our
authors should not be too matter-of-fact but should
give vent to their imagination and some of them
may have in them a suggestion of jules verne
who foretold what is happening today but which
in his era was considered impossible the late
gimon nfcomb the leading astronomer of
america said the airplane was an absolute im-
possibility leslie the state geologist of penn-
sylvania years ago predicted the end of the great
evolution of petroleum and natural gas from the
earth and years after that assertion and when
leslie is long dead we read of the oklahoma

some difficulties with via the
time accelerator more of
dr smiths stories wanted

 editor amazing stories

    i want to congratulate dr smith on his stories
 skylark of space and skylark three these
 two stories are the best i have ever read and that
 is saying a lot please have dr smith write
 some more skylark serials

    also i would like to have a reprint now and
 then for instance the conquest of mars
 interplanetary stories are my meat and please
 dont fail now

   in your january issue in via the time ac-
 celerator i dont quite get the idea of brock-
 hurst seeing himself coming down to land as he
 is just starting and seeing himself starting out
 as he is coming down also about the time when
 brockhurst was in the museum he saw his own
 plane and time machine the part i dont get
 is how the same airplane could be in two places
 at the same time

                       vincent de nardo
                          buchanan michigan

    dr smith is a comparatively new author who
 certainly has made a wonderful hit with the
 skylark stories as far as mr brockhurst
 and his plane and time machine are concerned
 it seems obvious that almost anything could
 happen if we could accelerate and retard time if
 we can go into the future and travel in the past
 he also is writing about impossibilities and we
 must expect to meet some contradictions of our
 present ideas-editors

 pleasant trips in interplanetary

  travel desired a tribute to
 dr breuer for his letter
 in the january issue
 editor amazing stories

   i have read dr breuers letter in the discus-
 sions department of the january issue of amaz-
 ing stories and i want to compliment him on
 his frankness in showing what he thinks of some
 of the wild and inhuman tales which have appeared
 in amazing stories

   and i say by all means give us interplanetary
 stories that we may leave this dull suspicious
 money-mad and unimaginative world on the
 wings of imagination

   but we all desire a pleasant trip why do the
 authors insist that we must continue to witness
 carnage and conquest plenty of that here on
 baby earth

   such stories keep alive the war spirit of con-
 quest true they contain plenty of action and
 therefore are interesting but they do not give
 the reader the satisfaction of constructive con-
 quest which he craves

   i believe the majority of the readers of amaz-
 ing stories prefer stories in which their ideal
 is realized without causing wholesale bloodshed

   amazing stories has never caused me to regret
 the purchase price for i consider even one good
 story of scientifiction well worth c i am one
 of your readers who always turn to the dis-
 cussions department first

   we are more than pleased to read that you
 turn to the discussions department first it
 always seems that it is a good start-off for any-
 one who is taking up amazing stories to see
 what other readers have to say about preceding
 issues we are going to give interplanetary stories
 and w have in mind the issuing of ofie quar-
 terly issue entirely devoted to them ersonaiiy
 we take the greatest interest in what our readers
 have to say and we put in the scolding letters
 which are not very numerous along with the
 complimentary ones dr breuer is a highly
 valued author-editor

a grading of stories in the janu-
ary issue the relative merit
of artists

 editor amazing stories

   one day last year i told dad i wanted a
 magazine a cover a brightly colored cover
 caught my eye i picked it up and leafed through
 it at a glance i knew it was the one i wanted
 i got it and read it through and it was all i could
 do to wait until the next issue was out the
 magazine was amazing stories i have read
 some other science fiction magazines but none
 satisfies me more than amazing stories i have
 shown it to some friends and now they are buying it

   now to get down to facts i write here to
 criticize your our magazine just as others do
 the cover could not be better it is perfectly
 colored and the pictures are usually taken from
 one of the best stories morey is an excellent
 artist and he makes the best cover of all paul
 and wesso are good artists but i think morey
 is the best

    everybody tells their favorite authors stories
 etc so i think ill follow suit it seems that
 jack williamson is growing to be a great favor-
 ite among other readers and likewise a great
 favorite to me

    the drums of tapajos is excellent i have
 just finished the january number and the story
 ends there i almost hated for it to stop capt
 s p meek is getting better and better each
 story that he writes as for the best stories in
 the january issue i classify them as follows

   -drums of tapajos-excellent -she
 prince of space-extra good -via ifie
 time accelerator-extra good -tanks
 under the sea-good -the act of retipuj
 -fair -the black hand-flair

    the stories for the next issue look as if they
 were going to be good everybody seems to talk
 about reprints i think it is a good idea myself
 but i would not publish them in amazing
 stories why not have a special magazine for
 reprints only

   i would like to give you a few points con-
 cerning the make-up of a s one good way to
 ruin it is to make the magazine smaller i did
 not know whether you had thought of it or not
 but please dont make it smaller the paper is
 fine better than a glossy paper would be every-
 thing is running fine but grab an interplanetary
 monthly before some other company does

   you will probably want to know who the man
 who wrote this is my name is lewis f tor-
 rance i am  years old and a freshman in
 high school i have a small telescope of my
 ownf and i buy several other magazines in-
 cluding science  invention

                         east th street
                               winfield kansas

    we have not the least idea of making amaz-
 ing stories a smaller magazine it has a sort
 of standard size and we certainly cannot but
 adhere to your suggestion the winter quarterly
 will be out when you read this but your criticisms
 develop into plain compliments which we certainly
 appreciate warmly-editor

a delightful letter from a co-ed
in louisiana

  editor amazing stories

     we like your magazine down here in louisiana
  we have read it for a number of years and we
  intend to continue we feel that amazing
  stories serves a definite need in literature that
  other magazines cannot supply fact is we know
  one co-ed who passed up a sorority-tea to look
  over a copy the new grade of paper is great
  just a bit of constructive criticism we en-
  joyed drums of tapajos by s p meek but
  when he didnt tell us what finally happened at
  troyana we felt we had missed something wt
  want a sequel to drums of tapajoe please
  please persuade capt meek to give us one we
  wish you luck and thank you for many hrs
  of excellent entertainment

                     virginia owen and others
                     louisiana state university
                     baton rouge louisiana

     we agree that lots of things might have hap-
  pened in the city of troyana it was quite de-
  lightful to get a letter from that very interesting
  type of humanity embodied in a co-ed and on
  account of the multiple nature of the signature
  we can enjoy the idea that a lot of the young
  sisterhood are complimenting us-editor

notes on the january and febru-
ary issues op amazing stories

 editor amazing stories

   just finished the february  issue of
 amazing stories i can hardly wait for the
 second part of television hill its the kind
 of a story i enjoy and i surely hope that in the
 second part king and wentworth dont destroy
 their invention if they are afraid to give it to
 the world they can wait cant they but if
 they wait someone else will invent a similar
 machine what a predicament 

   the man who annexed the moon was a
 fine story also and it contained a lot of fine
 science i think that the fellow who fell in the
 deep lunar pit was rather reckless though if
 that glass bulb had broken hed have been in
 a fix

   the purple plague was pretty good but i
 hate to have romance in scientific fiction the
 same goes for television hill the bees
 of borneo was pretty good also in short the
 whole magazine for february was good

   in the january issue the prince of space
 ranked first but it contained romance though
 time stories make excellent scientifiction they are
 impossible anyone with common sense can see
 that this of course applies to via the time
 accelerator

    of course i realize the zeiss planetarium in
  the adler planetorium is more or less of a time
  machine but even then a new comet may present
  itself two stars may collide or any number of
  things may happen that cannot be shown by the
  machine

   tanks under the sea is good too bad
 the world is so skeptical look at all the credit
 those yankees lost

   the black hand was good such operations
 will no doubt be possible in the near future even
 in this unenlightened era stomachs have been
 removed the oesophagus being joined to the
 intestines

   recently i got hold of a lot of old amazing
 stories it is interesting to note what inventions
 have verified some of your authors prophesies
 the lie detector for instance spoken of in the
 seventh generation such a machine was ac-
 tually perfected by some professors in the uni-
 versity of chicago

    that is all except that you might ask your
  artists to follow the descriptions given by authors
  more closely

                       charles w norris

                          parnell avenue

                                    chicago illinois

    we agree with you that some of our stories
  may rank as depicting the impossible but look
  at the next to the last paragraph of your letter
  where you say it is interesting to note what in-
  ventions have verified some of your authors
  prophesies as far as romance is concerned it
  is a very real thing in this world of ours and it
  often seems that the world would be a very dull
  place without it but of course it must always
  remain an incidental feature in a s-editor

editor amazing stories

  i have been a reader of your fascinating maga-
zine since its inception and wish now to give you
a pat on the back with a sting in it

  i enjoyed every word of drums of tapajos
and only hope that capt meek will see fit that he
give us a sequel wherein troyana is saved and
they give the world some of the advanced princi-
ples really age-old employed there and of course
let the boys win their respective maids

  i like the new paper upon which you print
but do not like the greater part of your cover
illustrations the fantastic depictions often let
me in for a lot of more or less good-natured
kidding from would-be friends moderation would
seem a good policy as concerning covers wasnt
the prince of space just a bit severe and im-
practical in the destruction of the planet mars
show me any forces that-gain as they expend
more likely that power diminishes as it is spent
now what will burroughs do with his famous
character john carter war lord of mars
please let us not destroy any more of the planets
what would happen to the remainder of our
constellation were one destroyed  does not
science demonstrate the speed of electricity as
that of light then if the martians bombarded
the prince with electrical rays would not the
force strike as it was seen if we must have
absolute impossibilities let them be reasoned in
logical fashion as was done in skylark three
one of the best if not the best scientifiction story
ever written	o e mumford

albuquerque new mexico

  we are sure that capt meek who has written
many stories for us will be delighted when he
reads what you say about his last story our
cover page illustrations are drawn from passages
in one or the other of the stories the artist
simply endeavors to express the authors idea
also we want to attract newsstand readers who
have never peered inside our pages you object
to having the planets destroyed we are shortly
going to have a story about a catastrophe affecting
the earth dr smith will be delighted when he
reads your opinion of the skylark stories he
is distinctively one of our staff authors and we
hope to have him with us for many months-

 a challenge to print is best met
 by printing the communication

 editor amazing stories

    no doubt you will receive a great manjr letters
 praising your use of smooth paper in the february
 issue of amazing stories i admit that it makes
 a vast improvement in the appearance of the
 magazine but the stories in that number are as
 bad as ever in fact your general run of fiction
 seems to be getting worse with every issue

   adoption of smooth paper doesnt mean any-
 thing it isnt physical appearance of a maga-
 zine that counts but the quality of the stuff it
 contains

   the subtitle of amazing stories is scientific
 fiction  thats an egregious misnomer your
 stories are little more than scientific treatises in
 narrative form they lack action adventure
 romance gripping suspense and human interest
 are utterly foreign to them with few excep-
 tions they are tedious insipid lifeless their
 dullness and vapidity are the more marked when
 compared with the sparkling vivid stories printed
 by a contemporary sclence-fiction magazine and
 this latter periodical was established a little over
 a year ago

   a few of your regular authors-meek vincent
 starzl-have the knack of writing sprightly real-
 istic stories that hold ones interest your other
 contributors are duds their abstruse scientific
 ramblings do not constitute readable fiction

    i challenge you to print this letter and allow
 your readers to comment freely upon it ill
 wager they agree with me

                      george k addison

                 brandt place bronx n y

    you need not challenge us to print your letter
 especially because you are willing to give your
 address when we get such severe comments and
 criticisms from the writers who do not give their
 address and sometimes even signed by initials we
 feel not the least inclination to publish what they
 have written if you will look at some of our
 other letters from correspondents you will find
 that many of them consider that our magazine is
 improving and getting better and better the
 editors are certainly working very hard at it and
 using every effort to give good stories we could

name many other authors than the three whom
you honor with your commendation who are equally
good mr verrill who has written a great deal
for us has been in the past a very voluminous
writer and his books have had a wide acceptance
by the public dr keller and dr breuer- we
put in the first rank of writers of stories of the
type which we need dr smith the author of
the skylark stories has received praises from
our readers enough to turn anybody s head mr
john w campbell jr a student in science has
been so much praised that we felt anxious about
him also at any rate we hope a great many of
our readers will answer your challenge to them
we want to know what they really think of a s
-editor

an artist criticised with a
comparison

editor amazing stories

  i wish your artist wesso would pay more at-
tention to the incident he illustrates before he
draws the picture on the cover of the august is-
sue the skylark is shown cutting the fenechrone
ship in two with the zone of force the ship is
shown cut squarely on page  it said each
piece was sharply cut as though sheared from its
neighbor by some gigantic curved blade the il-
lustration at the beginning of the story shows them
teaching shiro english with a mechanical educa-
tor at the same time the visiplate shows the fene-
chrone ship attacking them before their instru-
ments detect it if the visiplate is like a window
it could not show the skylark as though it was in
another ship i hope these criticisms dont dis-
courage wesso just tell him to read the story more
carefully and get the details right next to paul
wesso is the best science fiction artist i know of
that kind of illustrating is no easy job

   if the rest of the story is as good as the first
installment skylark three will rank as the
best story i ever read the skylark ot space
will take second place

                         general delivery
                         crescent city calif

  a scimitar has a curved blade but will make
a perfectly straight cut and this is only one in-
stance among many of the application of a curved
blade we place wesso in the front rank of our
artists and we are glad that in spite of your
criticism you do realize his ability in the sky-
lark stories the author seems to have hit the
popular taste very accurately that of course is
something that we all desire sometimes it seems
to us that dr smith is almost astonished at his
own success an author can never judge with
any degree of accuracy as to the merit of what he
has written it is the criticism of strangers that
tell the story and the skylark set has won great
enconiums-editor

an appreciation with construc-
tive criticism

editor amazing stories

  i received my february copy of amazing
stories today i sure was glad to see the new
paper that you are using its great you have
jiever had a better looking issue than this one
about a year ago you began improving the ap-
pearance of the magazine and i think now that
it has reached the peak of perfection all except
your illustrations what happened to paul he
is the best artist you ever hadand i believe ever
will have to be sure you had one or two
small illustrations y him in the past months but
i see none by him in this otherwise perfect febru-
ary issue paul is especially good on the covers
ask any of the old time readers who have been
with amazing stories since the days of 
moreys covers are notbad but they are too plain
and lack the finish that pauls have and paul
can blend color morey cant compare with him
the nearest one you have to paul is wesso and
we get very little from him

  and now for the stories jack williamsons
the green girl was the best story of the year
next came skylark three and the drums
of tapajos in a tie for second the best novel-
ette was the prince of space another by
williamson the stories have improved by leaps
and bounds throughout the past year it remained
for the quarterly however to supply the real
kick of the year i refer to those great novels
paradise and iron by dr breuer and a
modern prometheus by cyril q wates they
were great in the fall quarterly it states that
wesso illustrated the story the black star
passes it was done by paul and darn well
too this criticism is written with the idea of

construction and not to knock the magazine

  in closing i would like to say that i have long
admired your policy in running the magazine
you are not continually bragging about the con-
tents of the magazine and of its make-up neither
do you say that you are going to make such and
such improvement and give us a lot of sales
talk you just make the improvement you do
not cast slurs at other magazines all of these
are in your favor and are something to be
proud of

  one thing more do not change the size or
make-up of the magazine

  we are certainly glad to have your comment
on the february issue we are trying in our
humble way to get out as good a magazine as
we can possibly produce we are by no means
through trying yet you will see more of pauls
work in amazing stories we are sorry about
the error in giving credit to wesso for the illus-
trations of the black star passes which were
done by paul what especially pleases us about
such letters as yours is the loyalty expressed in
it for our magazine we want all our readers
to feel themselves part of the family-editor

a constant reader finds some

errors in amazing stories but
reads it assiduously

editor amazing stories

  have read every issue of amazing stories
since i was  in march -started saving
all copies in november  but unavoidably lost
some of them do you have any reserve copies
of the -- volumes if so what will the
issues cost each 

  i have a suggestion for your discussions column
in that there are so many adverse comments and
letters of criticism re interplanetary and forces-
how about requesting your authors to keep strictly
to facts and theories as generally accepted-when
these facts can be cleared up by readers let
them the authors use poetic license only when
the readers cannot check up on their logic for
instance you had a story where the interplanetary
ship was heading for a spot some certain distance
ahead-i think it was  trillions
miles away the ships maximum speed was

	miles per second yet the author figured
the minimum time it could be traveled at maximum
speed was  years dont you see the point i
forget the name of the story

the speed of a vessel or other object traveling

	miles per second would be -

	miles per year-therefore the interplanetary
ship could have covered  some odd trillion
miles in less than  years-whereas the author
said  years-only  years more-or  times
his actual time spent incidentally-the lady his-
torian was  some odd years old on arrival-
she wasnt near  when they started even
making allowance for acceleration-time the meas-
ures the author gave one against the other didnt
check

  now here is a compliment other publications
are paying amazing stories the sincerest compli-
ment possible by imitating your our magazine
as i am scientifically inclined i buy this magazine
too as the only trouble with your magazine is that
every issue has not only a beginning but an end-
ing-and last me only  minutes the quarterly
lasts about  minutes however i find both
copies a s and a s q and have reread most
of the copies  to  times

  oh yes by the way-wesso in amazing stories
january  picture of th dimension space
penetrator a good story-incidentally page -
shows the door to the machine opens on bent
hinges an impossibility moreover the door is
hinged upon its inner edge-yet is hinged to the
outer edge of the door opening also a bad error
in mechanics as the door would not close even if
the hinge were in a straight line-at least not
tight

laaaaaaaai

you are too fast a reader mr wesso can save his
face as they say by saying that the door you refer
to and its long hinge pin was so thin and elastic
that they could open and shut it although of the
construction he has shown but this we admit
would be decidedly begging the question we will
leave the answer to the rest of your letter to the
author of the story whose jnathematics you criti-
cize-editor	

a medal-winning letter from the

coast west not east a most
amusing tribute to some
of our authors

editor amazing stories

  feeling that my four years ten months perusal
of our own magazine in some way qualifies me
to criticize please accept the following as an-
other reader heard from line up the staff mr
editor they all have their share and any with
guilty consciences may hand in their resignations
-after i am through to proceed

 first for the authors mr repp turn
around and bend over there that hurt
me more than you mr repp but you had
it coming what do you mean by making spine-
less cowards and id hate to say what else out
of all your humans and vindictive superior per-
sonages of our visitors from other planets why
does the earthman always come out at the short
end  no reply sir the human race is a
noble courageous all-conquering aggregation of
men if they have any weaknesses you should
be ashamed to parade them in print look at dr
smith on your right there is a man to emulate
dr smith i congratulate you let me pin a
medal on your chest if i can find room but
dont feel swell-headed dr smith there is a
young man beside you who seems a trifle jealous
quite green-eyed in fact mr campbell i be-
lieve you envy dr smiths medal never
mind heres one for you too for your work on
the metal horde and when the atoms failed
you boys should get along better together space
is plenty large enough for both of you i admit
dr smiths characters have conquered and made
friends with more planets than yours mr camp-
bell but be resigned mr campbell be resigned
i would suggest that you get together and parcel
off the universe what say you take the south-
ern  hemisphere and leave the northern to dr
smith well ill let you decide being in
the advanced class you two may settle the ques-
tion between you but before i pass on let me
warn you against subs from below you know
there are other authors who would if they could
and may yet learn how how would you like to
make it a triangle get busy then and quit
bickering well well who is this mournfully
bent with elevated coat-tails and freely falling
tears why its edmond hamilton cheer up
mr hamilton i know some pretty mean things
have been said about you but im all for you
let me shake your hand ive wanted to ever
since i accompanied marlin whitely randall
and hunt through the meteoric swarms to save
the world i never lost faith in you mr ham-
ilton even when the ugly yellow disc-yellow is
my unfavorite color-of saturn was rushing up
at me and the gang was outside sweating away
in diving suits i never turned a hair i knew
you were looking after us mr hamilton i
nearly fell out of bed-it was the humidity not
excitement-but we got through and saved the
earth goodbye hope i see your name again
soon

  gosh mr editor ive only got five minutes
i cant take care of this army of authors heres
a handful of medals pin em on yourself if you
cant find any deserving authors your classy
editorials deserve at least one medal be sure
and put one on wesso and heres a brick for
morey tell him to fire it at dr keller if he
has no use for it what shall we do with harl
vincent readers the medals have it tell
that office boy to be more gentle when he throws
me at the waste basket last time you would have
thought he was bobby jones two strokes behind
on the last hole clear across the office and it
was your umbrella too as my parting shot
you can settle the rocket question by firing one
off in l taylor hansens head it should break
a speed record for acceleration also id like
to take this opportunity to admonish the fellow
with the sensitive mind who wrote in about the
ice man that he should stick by the authors
words when he reads a story

  thank you mr editor im through its
your turn	parker snapp

                            patterson st
                                eugene oregon

you certainly have earned the right to criti-
cise our humble efforts your letter is most
amusing the writer of the letter seems to be

one who lives in the stories that he reads which
certainly is the way to enjoy them we are glad
to see your last little brickbat which you throw
at the fellow with a sensitive mindif who took
such absurd exception to the ice man and
now we would like to put up a puzzle for our
readers is mr snapps letter a collection of
brickbats or not we find it rather hard to
decide-editor

some words from mr campbells
principal critic an interest-
ing communication from
dr edward e smith

editor amazing stories

  mr campbell is indeed a sprightly and cour-
teous gentleman again to quote my friend sir
nigel a couple of his blows landed right heav-
ily one in particular denting the old armor
grievously and methinks cracking a rib or two
however he is still technically unhorsed in the
main bout-his major thesis of the dud star

  reiteration is neither proof nor argument and
he is still sticking to the curved-space-time theory
worshiping it as the one undoubted and unquestion-
able fact it is not his deductions from that
theory that i have questioned but the theory it-
self as a theory-and a most tenuous abstruse
and highly extrapolated theory at that-i declare
it to be my privilege to violate it in any way i
please in my fiction even though i jnay believe in
it myself as firmly as does my opponent also i
declare that before mr campbell as a scientist
can make such positive statements so unequivocally
concerning possible and impossible things he
must be absolutely and mathematically certain of
the basic fundamental assumptions upon which his
conclusions rest and concerning the dud star
his basic assumptions are utterly incapable of
proof-they are theories really only hypotheses
and far from being facts therefore unless he
can prove otherwise-something neither einstein
jeans eddington nor millikan has ever attempted
to do-i must regretfully insist that sir camp-
bell shall close his pan and let me violate his pet
theory as much as i please 

  however i do not want this campbell-smith
thing to degenerate into a polemical running on
as they do forever like tennysons brook my
main purpose in writing this discussion is to
clear up a couple of very serious misconceptions
i have noted in the february number

  myron a elliott the zone of force did not
destroy matter it simply set up a spherical sur-
face of stasis inrthe ether through which neither
matter nor ordinary vibrations could pass thus
it acted as a pure shear of infinite power but
could not have any such effect upon air as you
have supposed i could not go very deeply into
theory in the story-in fact according to some i
went in too deep as it was-but i have something
like four hundred pages of notes from which i
will be glad to quote you in personal correspond-
ence if this brief explanation is not clear

  bill blanton and marshall smith shame on
you for not reading stories more carefully the
first illustration of skylark three was one of
the best pieces of work i have ever seen and
described the occurrence perfectly the picture of
the fenachrone vessel shown upon the visiplate
was not taken from the actual vessel which had
been destroyed previously as you say but was
taken from the brain of the captive this point
was brought out quite definitely i thought

  thanks all of you discussers for the won-
derful reception you have given the skylarks
-so much more than i expected or to be brutally
frank deserved i did end the skylark stories
definitely purposely so that you would all know
that they were done in fact i did not expect to
hear a single request for more however there
have been some such requests and if there are
enough more i will try again there are sev-
eral ways of getting away om that epilogue and

i	think that any writer can do his best work upon
stuff that he knows somebody will like it puts
bubbles in his think-tank

                 edward e smith phd

                             rippon ave
                              hillsdale mich

  we have come to the conclusion that dr
smiths letters anent the subject of writing for
publication are equal in value to his highly
esteemed fiction we are not going to make any
lengthy comment on dr smiths letter it is so
amusing and so much to the point that as far as
we can see it takes very good care of itself on
behalf of our artistic staff we certainly thank you
for what youve said for we have the weakness
to be rather proud of the members of that de-
partment we are sure that our readers will be
quite excited over your almost promise to give
them more skylark stories-edito
 the great radio industry
 because of its amazingly
 rapid growth is today
 badlyin needof hundreds
 of trained men to fill
 its more responsible jobs
 in radiotalking pictures
 and television work

offered by the worlds

fastest growing business

 to qualify for these jobs men

 must know radio as they know their a b cs they must
 know the theory as well as the practice and be able to
 teach other men some of the things they know

 to such men the great radio industry offers a wonderful
 opportunity for steady work at exceptionally good pay
 now and early advancement to still better jobs as a future
 it is in fact the chance of a life-time for ambitious men

 but first these men must be trained for no ordinary
 knowledge of radio will do

 the radio industry itself has no time to train these men
 it is growing so fast and changing so fast that its manufac-
 turers and jobbers have all they can do to keep up with
 the trend of the times by improving their methods of
 manufacture and distribution

 so the training of men for these jobs has become the task
 of the radio and television institute of chicago

 as few men can afford to quit their work and get this
 training at some university or technical school the
 radio and television institute has been organized to train
 such men at home - no matter where they live-in their

too coop
to hiss

 spare time and at a very nominal cost
 for these better paying jobs in radio
 talking pictures and television

 the institutes course of home-train-
 ing was planned written and is
 actually supervised by an advisory
 board made up of prominent and
 highly paid engineers and executives
 each of whom is actively connected
 with some big radio concern

 this means that your training will be right because these
 men working with big radio concerns know exactly what
 the industry needs in the way of trained men and ex-
 actly how you should be trained to meet that need and
 this advisory board wiu have complete supervision over
 your training from the day that you become a student of
 this institution

 for this reason prominent radio men everywhere-and
 our countrys largest and most important radio trades
 associations - are unqualifiedly endorsing this home
 training and recommending it to men whom they want to
 see make good in radio work

 so if you are ambitious-if you are making a cent less
 than  a week-investigate

 find out for yourself all about this amazingly easy course
 of home-training and also all about the wonderful oppor-
 tunities for trained men in this the worlds fastest
 growing industry everything is fully explained in the
 radio and television institutes opportunity book
