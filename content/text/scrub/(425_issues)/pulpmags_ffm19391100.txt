                      a year ago he was set to be fired

                vow fftf rrmp-mav
                t mf boss

yes sir continued
    i

 joe his desk used to be
 right next to mine-now look where he is

 half proudly and half enviously he and frank
 watched ed as he swung down the company steps his
 arm linked in that of jp the head of the firm
 ed is getting  a year now while joe at
  is a long way ahead of frank a newcomer

  boy he must be plenty smart said frank

 plenty smart isright said joe ed has a lot on
 the ball but in spite of that he was slated to go

 for what frank wanted to know a guy like
 that 

 well maybe you wouldnt believe it but it was
 his breath 

 drank a lot eh

 not ed never a drop but most of the time he had
 a case of halitosis that would knock you down

 one of those birds eh didnt he read the listerine
 antiseptic ads didnt anybody tip him off

 sure i tipped him off but not before he almost got
 the toss you see ed had to see an awful lot of people-
 close contact stuff at first they never said anything
 about it but later on that breath of his was getting him
 in bad with his customers finally a few of the
 crustier ones began to write in complaining
 and at last j p himself got on to it	vsv

 youd think jp would say something  
 a good man like ed

 i understand he did frank maybe he didnt make
 it plain enough anyhow ed never took a tumble-and
 his job hanging in the balance

chump

 you said it but theres hundreds like him suspect-
 ing everybody but themselves

 well demanded f-ank what happened

 i got ed out one night after a couple of drinks to
 give me courage i let him have the bad news about
 that breath of his told him he better get going on
 listerine and keep it up if he wanted to stay on with
 the firm

 you certainly didnt pull your punches

 i certainly didnt and boy was he sore at first
 and then grateful worked my hand up and down like
 it was a pump handle since then you never saw a guy
 so careful about the impression he makes on others

 frank nodded the last place i worked they were
 plenty fussy about that sort of thing i think every firm

 should have a standing order listerine antiseptic be-
 fore you call on a customer i guess it pays

   and how if you think it didnt just look at ed
 he sure is going places

 nobody it immune everybody probably ha halitosis bad
 breath at rome time or other without realizing it thats the
 insidious thing about this offensive condition sometimes
 halitosis is due to systemic conditions but usually and for-
 tunately it is caused say some authorities by fermentation
 of tiny food particles in the mouth listerine quickly halts
 such food fermcntntiim anil then overcomes the odors it
 causes your breath becomes sweeter purer less likely to
 offend always use listerine before business and social en-
 gagements lambert iharmacid co st inuit mo

before you go to work use listerine for halitosis bad breath

i saw a white fire that shone like stars in a swirl of mist and i stood helpless while the sparkling
devil pulled my dear ones over the ships rail into the eerie light i saw them a little while whirling
away in the moon track behind the ship-and then they were gonel

a sequel to the moon pool

                 through the moon door to grapple with
                 the dread dweller and wrest the six
                 lost ones from their prison of icy flame


the conquest of
            the moon pool

 by a merritt
 part i

chapter i

the dweller

  as i begin this narrative  find it nec-
- essary to refer briefly to my orig-
 inal recital which appeared under
the title of the moon pool of the causes
that led me into the adventure of which
it is to be the history the adventure
which would forge the last links in the
chain to bind the dweller

  i have told you of that dread night on
the southern queenf when the monstrous
shining thing of living light and mingled
rapture and horror embraced throckmar-
tin and drew him from his cabin down
the moon path to its lair beneath the
moon pool i had promised throckmartin
to solve the mystery but i had delayed
keeping this promise for three years be-
lieving nothing could really be done and
fearing my story would not be believed
at last however remorse drove me into
action

  had i set forth for that group of south-
ern pacific islets called the nan-matal
where the moon pool lay hidden a day
before or after i would not have found
olaf huldricksson hands lashed to the
wheel of his ravished brunkilda steering
it even in his sleep down the track of the
dweller olaf whose wife and babe the
dweller had snatched from him nor would
i have picked up larry okeefe from the
wreck of his flying boat fast sinking under
the long swells of the pacific and without
okeefe and huldricksson that weird and
almost unthinkably fantastic drama en-
acted beyond the moon pools gates must
have had a very different curtain

  the remorse of a botanist the burning
bitter hatred of a norse seaman the
breaking of a wire in a flying-boats wing
-all these meeting at one fleeting moment
formed the slender tripod upon which
rested the fate of humanity could that
universal irony which seems to mold our
fortunes go further

  but there they were-okeefe and hul-
dricksson and i larry okeefe and olaf
huldricksson and i and lakla of the
flower face and wide golden eyes lakla
the handmaiden of the silent ones and
the three who had fashioned the dweller
from earths secret heart-each thread in
its place

  and so humanity lives

  and now let me recall to those who read
my first narrative and to make plain to
those who did not what it was that took
me on my quest that enigmatic prelude
in which the dweller first tried its growing
power

  you will remember that dr david
throckmartin one of americas leaders in
archeological and ethnological research had
set out for the caroline islands accompa-
nied by his young wife edith his equally
youthful associate dr charles stanton
and mrs throckmartins nurse from baby-
hood thora helverson

  their destination was that extraordinary
cluster of artificially squared basalt-
walled islets off the eastern coast of pon-
ape the largest caroline island known as
the nan-matal it was throckmartins be-
lief that in those prehistoric ruins lay the
clue to the lost and highly civilized race
which had peopled that ancient continent
which sinking beneath the waters of the

famous fantastic mysteries

pacific atlantis-like had left in the islands
we call polynesia only its highest peaks

  dr throckmartin planned to spend a
year on the nan-matal hoping that within
its shattered temples and terraces its
vaults and cyclopean walls or in the maze
of secret tunnels that running under the
sea threaded together the isles he would
recover not only a lost page of the history
of our races but also perhaps a knowledge
that had vanished with it

  the subsequent fate of this expedition
formed what became known as the throck-
martin mystery three months after the
little party had landed at ponape and
had been accompanied to the ruins by a
score of reluctant native workmen-reluc-
tant because all the islanders shun the
nan-matal as a haunted place-dr
throckmartin appeared alone at port
moresby papua

  there he said that he was going to mel-
bourne to employ some white workmen to
help him in his excavations the super-
stitions of the natives making their use-
fulness negligible he took passage on the
southern queen sailing the same day that
he appeared and three nights later he van-
ished utterly from that vessel

  it was officially reported that he had
either fallen from the ship or had thrown
himself overboard a relief party sent to
the nan-matal for the others in his party
found no trace of his wife of stanton or
of thora helverson the native workmen
questioned said that on the nights of the
full moon the ani or spirits of tlie ruins
had great power that on these nights no
ponapean would go within sight or sound
of them and that by agreement with
throckmartin they had been allowed to re-
turn to their homes on these nights leav-
ing the expedition to face the spirits
alone

after the full of the moon on the
third month of the expeditions stay
the natives had returned to the throck-
martin camp only to find it deserted and
then knowing that the ani had been
stronger they had fled

  i had been a passenger with throck-
martin on the southern queen i had been
with him when that wondrous horror
which had followed him down the moon
path after it had set its unholy seal upon
him had snatched him from the vessel
he had told me his story and i had prom-
ised heaven forgive me that if the
dweller took him as it had taken his wife
and stanton and thora i would follow

  he had told me his story and i knew
that story was true-for twice i had seen
the inexplicable power which throckmar-
tin discovering had loosed upon himself
and those who loved him that unearthly
thing which left on the faces of its prey
soul-deep lines of mingled agony and rap-
ture of joy celestial and misery infernal
side by side as though the hand of god
and the hand of satan working in harmony-
had etched them

   first beheld the dweller on that first
night out from papua when it came rac-
ing over the horizon to claim throckmar-
tin

  we two were on the upper deck he had
not yet summoned the courage to tell me
of what had befallen him storm threat-
ened but suddenly far to the north the
clouds parted and upon the waters far
away the moon shone

  swiftly the break in the high-flung
canopies advanced toward us and the silver
rapids of the moon stream between them
came racing down toward the southern
queen like a gigantic shining serpent
writhing over the rim of the world and
down its shimmering length a pillared ra-
diance sped it reached the barrier of
blackness that still held between the ship
and the head of the moon stream and beat
against it with a swirling of shimmering
misty plumes throbbing lacy opalescences
and vaporous spiralings of living light

  then as the protecting shadow grew
less i saw that within the pillar was a
core a nucleus of intense light-veined
opalescent vital and through gusts of
tinkling music came a murmuring cry as
of a calling from another sphere making
soul and body shrink from it irresistibly
the conquest of the moon pool



and reach toward it with an infinite
longing av-o-lo-ha av-o-lo-ha  it
sighed

  straight toward the radiant vision
walked throckmartin his face transformed
from all human semblance by unholy
blending of agony and rapture that had
fallen over it like a mask and then-the
clouds closed the moon path was blotted
out and where the shining thing had been
was-nothing

  what had been there was the dweller

  it was after i had beheld that appari-
tion that throckmartin told me what would-
have been save for what my own eyes
had seen his incredible story how upon a
first night of the full moon camping on
another shore they had seen lights moving
on the outer bulwarks of that islet of the
nan-matal called nan-tanach the place
of frowning walls and faintly to them
over the waters had crept the crystalline
music while far beneath as though from
vast distant caverns a mighty muffled
chanting had risen how on going to nan-
tanach next day they had found set within
the inner of its three titanic terraces a
slab of stone gray and cold and strangely
repellent to the touch above it and on
each side was a rounded breast of basalt
in each of which were seven little circles
that gave to the hand that same alien
shock as of frozen electricity that con-
tact with the gray slab gave

  and that night when sleep had seemed
to drop down upon them from the moon
but before the sleep had conquered him
he had seen the court of the gray rock
curdle with light into it had walked thora
bathed and filled with a pulsing effulgence
beside which all earthly light was shadow

  he told me of their search for thora
at dawn when the slumber had fallen
from their eyes and of their discovery of
her kerchief caught beneath the lintel of
the gray slab betraying that it had opened
and opening closed upon her of their
efforts to force it and of the vigil that
night when stanton was taken and walked
like a corpse in which flamed a god and
a devil in the embrace of the dweller

upon the shattered walls of tanach van-
ishing at last through the moon door even
as had thora and the muffled distant
mighty chanting as of a multitude that
hailed his passage

  after that of the third night when his
wife and he watched despairingly beside the
moon door waiting for it to open hoping
to surprise the shining thing that came
through it and surprising conquer it of
their wait until the moon swam up and
its full light shone upon the terrace of the
sudden gleaming out of the little circles
under its rays and of the sighing murmur
of the moon door swinging open as its
hidden mechanism responded to the force
of the light falling on the circles and of
his mad rush down the glimmering pas-
sage beyond the moon-door portal to the
threshold of the wondrous chamber of the
moon pool

absorbed silent marveling i lis-
tened as he described that place of
mystery-a vaulted arch that seemed to
open into space a space filled with lam-
bent coruscating many-colored mist whose
brightness grew even as he watched before
him an awesome pool circular perhaps
twenty feet wide around it a low softly
curving lip of glimmering silvery stone
the pools water was palest blue within
its silvery rim it was like a great blue eye
staring upward

  upon it streamed seven shafts of radi-
ance they poured down upon it like tor-
rents they were like shining pillars of
light rising from a sapphire floor one was
the tender pink of the pearl one of the
auroras green a third a deathly white
the fourth the blue in mother-of-pearl a
shimmering column of pale amber a beam
of amethyst a shaft of molten silver the
pool drank them

  and even as throckmartin gazed he
saw run through the blue water tiny
gleams of phosphorescence sparkles and
coruscations of pale incandescence and
far far down in its depths he sensed a
movement a shifting gleam as of some ra-
diant body slowly rising


famous fantastic mysteries

  mists then began to float up from the
surface tiny swirls that held and hung in
the splendor of the seven shafts absorbing
their glory and at last coalescing into the
shape i had seen and that he called the
dweller

  he had raised his pistol and sent bullet
after bullet into it and as he did so out
from it swept a gleaming tentacle it
caught him above the heart wrapped it-
self round him over him rushed a mingled
ecstasy and horror it was he said as
though the cold soul of evil and the burn-
ing soul of good had stepped together
within him

  he saw that the shining nucleus of that
which he had watched shape itself from
vapors and light had form-but a form
that eyes and brain could not define as
though a being of another world should
assume what it might of human semblance
but could not hide that what human eyes
saw was still only a part of it it was
neither man nor woman it was unearthly
and androgynous and even as he found its
human semblance that semblance changed
while all the while every atom of him
thrilled with interwoven rapture and
terror

  behind him he had heard the swift feet
of his wife racing to his aid love gave
him power and he wrested himself from
the dweller even as he did so he fell and
saw her rush straight into the radiant
glory saw too the dweller swiftly wrap
its shining mists around her and drew her
over the lip of the pool dragged himself
to the verge and watched her sink in its
embrace down down through the depths-
a shining many-colored nebulous cloud
and in it ediths face disappearing her
eyes staring up at me filled with ecstasy
supernal and infernal horror-and-van-
ished  

  then far below again the triumphant
chanting

  there had come to throckmartin mad-
ness he had memory of running wildly
through glimmering passages then black-
ness and oblivion until he found himself
far out at sea in the little boat they had
used to cruise around the lagoons of the

nan-matal he had bribed the half-caste
captain of a ship that picked him up to
take him to port moresby from whence
he intended to go to melbourne hoping to
find some who would return with him
force the haunted chamber and battle with
him against the dweller

  and on that third night i cowered in the
corner of his cabin and saw the dweller
take him

  for three years i was silent and then
obeying a sudden irresistible impulse i
started alone for the nan-matal to make
reparation for throckmartin had not en-
tirely believed that his wife was dead nor
stanton nor thora rather he thought that
they might be held in some unearthly
bondage

  and he had too a vague belief that the
deep underground chantings that had ac-
companied the disappearance of the
dweller with its victims pointing clearly
as they did to the existence of other beings
or powers in its mysterious den held a vast
threat against humanity how true was his
scientific clairvoyance and yet how far
from the amazing unthinkable truth you
are to learn it was my own conviction
that in both he had been right and it was
this conviction which now forced me on-
ward at all speed toward the carolines

  i delayed my departure from america
only long enough to get certain instru-
ments and apparatus that long brooding
over the phenomena had suggested might
be useful in coping with them

  nine weeks later with my parapher-
nalia i was northward bound from port
moresby on the suwarna a swift little
copra sloop with a fifty-horse-power motor
auxiliary and heading for ponape-for the
nan-matal and the chamber of the moon
pool and all that it held for me of soul-
shaking awe and peril

chapter ii

the sparkling devil took them

we sighted the brunhilda some five
hundred miles south of ponape
soon after we had left port moresby the
wind had fallen but the suwarna although
the conquest of the moon pool



tar from being as fragrant as the javan
flower for which she was named could do
her twelve knots an hour da costa the
captain was a garrulous portuguese the
crew were six huge chattering tonga boys

  the suwarna had cut through finscha-
fen huon gulf to the protection of the
bismarcks and we were rolling over the
thousand-mile stretch of open ocean with
new hanover far behind us and our boats
bow pointed straight toward nukuor of the
monte verdes after we had rounded nu-
kuor we should barring accident reach
ponape in not more than sixty hours

  beneath us the slow prodigious swells
of the pacific lifted us in gentle giant
hands and sent us as gently down the long
blue wave slopes to the next broad upward
slope there was a spell of peace over the
ocean that was semihypnotic stilling even
the portuguese captain who stood dreamily
at the wheel slowly swaying to the rhyth-
mic lift and fall of the sloop

  there came a whining hail from the
tonga boy lookout draped lazily over the
bow

  sail he blong port side

  da costa straightened and gazed while
i raised my glass the vessel was a scant
mile away and must have been visible
long before the sleepy watcher had seen
her she was a sloop about the size of
the suwarna without power all sails set
even to a spinnaker she carried she was
making the best of the little breeze i tried
to read her name but the vessel jibed
sharply as though the hands of the man
at the wheel had suddenly dropped the
helm-and then with equal abruptness
swung back to her course the stern came
in sight and on it i read brunhilda

  i shifted my glasses to the figure at the
wheel it came to me that there was some-
thing odd about him he was crouching
down over the spokes in a helpless hud-
dled sort of way and even as i looked
the vessel veered again abruptly as be-
fore i saw the helmsman straighten up
and bring the wheel about with a vicious
jerk

  he stood so for a moment looking
straight ahead entirely oblivious of us

and then seemed again to sink down within
himself it came to me that his was the
action of a man striving against a weari-
ness unutterable i swept the deck with
my glasses there was no other sign of
life i turned to find the portuguese star-
ing intently and with puzzled air at the
sloop now separated from us by a scant
half mile

  something veree wrong i think there
sair he said in his curious english the
man on deck i know he is captain and
owner of the br-rwunild his name olaf
huldricksson what you say-norwegian
he is eithair veree sick or veree tired but
i do not understand where is the crew and
the starbd boat is gone

  as he spoke i clearly saw the arms at
the wheel of the brunhilda relax the wheel
spin and the vessel lurch about to swell
and wind and saw again the helmsman
stiffen like a man awakened violently from
deep sleep saw his arms tighten spas-
modically and bring the ship once more
to her course

  veree sick or somet-ing veree wrong
da costa repeated i tink i better go
close and see if he need help sair

  it was the right thing to do i nodded
acquiescence he shouted an order to the
engineer and as he did so the faint breeze
died utterly and the sails of the brunhilda
flapped down inert i saw the helmsman
glare about him and thought i heard him
curse but we were now nearly abreast and
a scant five hundred yards away the en-
gine of the suwarna died and the tonga
boys leaped to one of the boats

  you olaf huldricksson shouted da
costa whats a matter wit you

  the man at the wheel turned toward us
as his body lifted i saw that he was a
giant of a man his shoulders enormous
thick chested strength in every line of him
he towered like a viking of old at the rud-
der bar of his sharp ship

  i raised the glass again his face sprang
into the lens as though he himself had
leaped from his deck and was staring at
me and never have i seen a face that was
lined and marked as though by ages of
unsleeping misery as was that of olaf hul-


famous fantastic mysteries

dricksson the bloodshot eyes peered into
mine with a look in their depths that might
have been in the eyes of a mummy

the glasses dropped from my shaking
hand the two tonga boys had the
boat alongside and were waiting at the
oars the little captain was dropping
into it

  wait i cried i ran into my cabin
grasped my emergency medical kit and
climbed down the rope ladder the two
tonga boys bent to the oars we reached
the side and da costa and i each seized a
lanyard dangling from the stays and swung
ourselves swiftly on board da costa ap-
proached huldricksson softly

  whats the matter olaf he began
and then was silent looking down at the
wheel my gaze followed his and we
shrank together involuntarily for the
hands of huldricksson were lashed fast
to the spokes of the wheel by thongs of
thin strong cord they had been bound
so tightly that they were swollen and black
the thongs had bitten so into the sinewy
wrists that they were hidden in the out-
raged flesh cutting so deeply that blood
fell slow drop by drop at his feet we
sprang toward him reaching out hands to
his fetters to loose them even as we
touched them huldricksson grew rigid
with anger that had in it something dia-
bolic he aimed a vicious kick at me and
then another at da costa which sent the
portuguese tumbling into the scuppers

  let be croaked huldricksson his
voice was as thick and lifeless as though
forced from a dead throat and i saw that
his lips were cracked and dry and his
parched tongue was black let be go
let be the words beat upon the ears
heavily painfully it was the dead alive
and speaking

  the portuguese had picked himself up
whimpering with rage and knife in hand
but as huldrickssons voice reached him he
stopped amazement crept into his eyes
and as he thrust the blade back into his
belt they softened with pity

  something veree wrong wit olaf he
murmured to me i think he crazee

and then olaf huldricksson began to curse
us he did not speak-he howled from that
hideously dry mouth his imprecations and
i think i never heard such hate and bit-
terness issue from any mans lips he
cursed us by everything in heaven and
earth and hell-yes and he cursed earth
hell and heaven as well and all the time
his bloodshot eyes roamed the seas and
his hands clenched and rigid on the wheel
dropped blood

  i go below said da costa nervously
his wife his little freda they are always
wit him you wait he darted down the
companionway and was gone huldricksson
suddenly was silent slumping down over
the wheel forgetting us

  da costas head appeared at the top of
the companion steps

  there is nobody nobody he said
i do not understan

  then olaf huldricksson opened his dry
lips again and as he spoke a thrill ran
through me stopping my heart

  the sparkling devil took them
croaked olaf huldricksson the sparkling
devil took them took my helma and my
little freda the sparkling devil came
down from the moon and took them 

  he swayed and two great tears ran
down his cheeks da costa moved toward
him again and again huldricksson watched
him once more alertly wickedly from
his reddened eyes

  i took a hypodermic syringe from my
case and filled it with morphin i drew
da costa to me

  get to the side of him i whispered
talk to him he saw the little syringe
in my hand and nodded he moved over
toward the wheel

 where is your helma and freda
olaf he said

  huldricksson turned his head toward
him the shining devil took them he
repeated the moon devil

  a yell broke from him i had thrust the
needle into his arm just above one swollen
wrist and had quickly shot the drug
through he struggled to release himself
and then began to rock drunkenly side by
side the morphin taking him in his weak-
the conquest of the moon pool



ness worked quickly soon over his face
we saw a peace descend the pupils of the
staring eyes contracted once twice he
swayed and then his bleeding prisoned
hands held high and still gripping the
wheel he dropped to the deck

  it was with utmost difficulty that we
loosed the thongs but at last it was done
we rigged a little swing and the tonga
boys slung the great inert body over the
side into the dory soon we had huldricks-
son in my bunk da costa sent half his
crew over to the sloop in charge of the
cantonese they took in all sail stripping
huldrickssons boat to the masts and then
with the brunhilda nosing quietly along
after us at the end of a long hawser one
of the tonga boys at her wheel we re-
resumed our way

  i had cleansed and bandaged the drug-
ged norsemans lacerated wrists and was
sponging the blackened parched mouth
with warm water and a mild antiseptic
when the portuguese softly entered the
cabin i did not hear him until he spoke
so engrossed was i in my thoughts of this
mystery of the brunhilda at first when
huldricksson had spoken of a sparkling
devil from the moon i had felt a shock
of apprehension could it be that on the
very threshold of my quest the dweller
had come out to meet me

  but in the light of huldrickssons fet-
tering this thought had vanished there
had probably occurred on the brunhilda
one of those swift devilish tragedies of
the south seas that ever and anon flare
up like lightning out of hell a mutiny of
the only half tamed crew a treacherous
blow from behind that had felled the
norseman to the deck a mordant humor
or obscure superstition that had left him
to awaken fettered to the wheel of his rav-
ished vessel a carrying away of mother
and child to some unspeakable death

such a story is a commonplace in those
vast reaches of sea and sea-hidden lairs
of cruel and savage tribes and yet there
was no mark or blow upon the captains
head suddenly i was aware of da costas
presence and turned his unease was mani-

fest and held it seemed to me a queer
furtive anxiety

  what you think of olaf sair he
asked i shrugged my shoulders you
think he killed his woman and his babee
he went on you think he crazee and
killed all

  nonsense da costa i answered
you saw the boat was gone his crew
mutinied and tied him up the way you
saw

  da costa shook his head slowly no
he said no the crew did not nobody
there on board when olaf was tied

  what i cried startled what do
you mean

  i mean he said slowly that olaf tie
himself

  wait he went on at my incredulous
gesture of dissent wait i show you
he had been standing with hands behind
his back and now i saw that he held in
them the same thongs that had bound
huldricksson they were bloodstained and
each ended in a broad leather tip skill-
fully spliced into the cord look he
said pointing to these leather ends i
looked and saw in them deep indentations
as of teeth i snatched one of the thongs
and opened the mouth of the unconscious
man on the bunk carefully i placed the
leather within it and gently forced the
jaws shut on it it was true those marks
were where olaf huldrickssons teeth had
gripped dazed i turned to da costa

  wait he said again i show you
he took the cords and rested his hands
on the supports of a chair back rapidly
he twisted one of the thongs around his
left hand drew a loose knot shifted the
cord up toward his elbow this left wrist
and hand still free and with them he
twisted the other cord around the right
wrist drew a similar knot his hands
were now in the exact position that hul-
drickssons had been on the brunhilda but
with cords and knots hanging loose then
da costa reached down his head took
a leather end in his teeth and with a jerk
drew the end of the thong that noosed
his left hand tight similarly he drew
tight the second


famous fantastic mysteries

  and then he stood and strained at his
fetters there before my eyes he had pin-
ioned himself so that without aid he could
not release himself and he was exactly
as huldricksson had been

  you will have to cut me loose sair
he said i cannot move them it is an
old trick on these seas sometimes it is
necessary that a man stand at the wheel
many hours without help and he does
this so that if he sleep the wheel wake
him yes sair

  i looked from him to the man on the
bed

  but why sair said da costa slowly
did olaf have to tie his hands

  i had no answer

  well have to wait till he awakens
captain i said he nodded acquiescence
and was silent for a time what did you
think sair of what he said of sparkling
devils he asked at last and as he spoke
i knew that this was what had been on
his mind all along clearly he knew some-
thing had heard something that gave
the words i had dismissed an unquieting
significance i looked at him closely

  i dont know i said do you

  he fidgeted avoided my eyes and then
surreptitiously crossed himself

  no he replied i know nothing
some tilings i have heard but they tell
many tales on these seas

  he turned almost abruptly and started
for the door before he reached it he
turned again but this i do know he
half whispered i do know i am glad
there is no full moon tonight he passed
out leaving me staring after him in
amazement what did the portuguese
know

  i bent over the sleeper on his face was
no trace of that unholy mingling of oppo-
sites of mingled joy and fear that the
dweller stamped upon its victims but
with da costas revelations the security
i had felt in my theory of the prisoned
wrists crumbled huldrickssons words
came back to me-the sparkling devil
took them nay they had been even
more explicit-the sparkling devil that
came down from the moon

  they sank upon my heart like weights
carrying subconscious conviction that re-
sisted all my efforts to dismiss i lifted
the sheet from huldricksson and went over
his body minutely turning it from side to
side the norseman was as i have said
a giant and his mighty muscled form was
clean and white as a girls nowhere was
there a trace of that cold white stain which
was the mark of the touch of the dweller
and that had been on throckmartin a
shining cincture girdling the body just be-
low the heart

  throckmartin had believed and i had
believed with him that the thing i had
gone forth to find had no power outside
the islet of the moon door and that it was
only by virtue of that mark it had been
enabled to follow him but was this true
huldricksson had been steering straight
for ponape not away from it-and there
was no trace of the nan-matals dread
mystery upon him

  had the dweller swept down unheralded
and unknown upon the brunhilda draw-
ing down the moon path olaf huldricks-
sons wife and babe even as it had drawn
throckmartin but if this were so then
i must revise much of what i thought i
knew of its action for the ravishing of
the brunhilda could mean only one of two
things we had been wrong in our theory
that the dwellers power was limited by
place or else in the years that had passed
its power had overcome that limitation

  as i sat thinking the cabin grew sud-
denly dark and from above came a shout-
ing and patter of feet down upon us
swept one of the abrupt violent squalls
that are met with in those latitudes i
lashed huldricksson fast in the berth and
ran up on deck

a half hour passed then the squall
died as quickly as it had arisen the
sea quieted over in the west from be-
neath the tattered flying edge of the
storm dropped the setting sun

  i watched it and rubbed my eyes and
stared again for over its flaming portal
something huge and black moved like a
gigantic beckoning finger
the conquest of the moon pool

is

  da costa had seen it too and he
turned the suwarna straight toward the
descending orb and its strange shadows
as we approached we saw it was a little
mass of wreckage and that the beckoning
finger was a wing of canvas sticking up
and swaying with the motion of the waves
on the highest point of the wreckage sat
a tall figure calmly smoking a cigarette

  we brought the suwarna to dropped
a boat and with myself as coxswain pulled
toward what i knew now was a wrecked
hydroplane its occupant took a long puff
at his cigarette waved a cheerful hand
and shouted a reassuring greeting and
just as he did so a great wave raised itself
up behind him took the wreckage tossed
it high in a swelter of foam and passed
on when we had steadied our boat where
wreck and man had been was-nothing

  i scanned the water with anxious eyes
who had been this debonair castaway
and from whence in these far seas had
dropped his plane there came a tug at
the side of our boat two muscular brown
hands gripped it close to my left and
a sleek black wet head showed its top
between them two bright blue eyes that
held deep within them a laughing dev-
iltry looked into mine and a long lithe
body drew itself gently over the thwart
and seated its dripping self at my feet

  much obliged said this man from
the sea i knew somebody was sure to
come along when the okeefe banshee
didnt show up

  the what i asked in amazement
the okeefe banshee oh yes pardon
me im larry okeefe its a far way
from ireland but not too far for the
okeefe banshee to travel if the okeefe
was going to kick in

  i looked again at my astonishing res-
cue he seemed perfectly serious and later
i was to know how exasperatingly
naively and entirely serious he was on
that subject

  have you a cigarette said larry
okeefe mine went out he added with
a grin as he reached a moist hand out
for the little cylinder took it lighted it
on the match i struck for him and then

gazed at me frankly and with manifest
curiosity i returned the gaze as frankly

  i saw a lean intelligent face whose
fighting jaw was softened by the wistful-
ness of the clean-cut lips and the roguish-
ness that lay side by side with the deviltry
in the laughing blue eyes nose of a thor-
oughbred with the suspicion of a tilt
a long well-knit slender figure that i
knew must have all the strength of fine
steel the uniform of a lieutenant in the
royal flying corps of britains navy

  he laughed stretched out a firm hand
and gripped mine

  thank you really ever so much old
man he said

  i liked larry okeefe from the begin-
ning but i did not dream how that liking
was to be forged into mans strong love
for man by fires which souls such as his
and mine-and yours who read this-could
never dream

  larry larry okeefe where are you
now with your leprechawns and banshee
your heart of a child your laughing blue
eyes and your fearless soul shall i ever
see you again larry okeefe dear to
me as some best-beloved younger brother
larry

chapter iii

larry okeefe

pressing back the questions i longed
to ask i introduced myself

  a second later we touched the side of
the suwarna and i was forced to curb
my curiosity until we reached the deck
da costa greeted us eagerly and was
plainly gratified hv the military salute
which okeefe bestowed upon him

  you havent seen a german boat called
the wolf about have you he asked with
a grin after he had elaborately thanked
the bowing little portuguese skipper for
his rescue that thing you saw me sitting
on was all that was left of one of his maj-
estys best little hydroplanes after that
cyclone threw it off as excess baggage
and by the way about where are we

  da costa gave him our approximate
position from the noon reckoning


famous fantastic mysteries

  okeefe whistled a good three tran-
dred miles from where i left the h m s
dolphin about four hours ago he said
that squall i rode in on was some whiz-
zer

  about an hour ago i thought i saw a
chance to dig up and out of it i turned
and blick went my upper right wing
and down i dropped engine began to
work loose and just as i knew something
had to come along quick or the banshee
of the okeefes was due for a long swift
trip from ireland i sighted you

  and here i am and again i say im
much obliged to you finished larry
okeefe and ill take another cigarette
if you dont mind

  i dont know how we can notify your
ship lieutenant okeefe i said we
have no wireless

  doctair goodwin said da costa we
could change our course sair-perhaps-
thanks but not a bit of it broke in
okeefe lord alone knows where the
dolphin is now anyway the dolphin is
just as apt to run into you as you into
her maybe well strike something with a
wireless and ill trouble you to put me
aboard he hesitated where are you
bound by the way he asked

  for ponape i answered

  no wireless there mused okeefe
beastly hole stopped a week ago for
fruit natives seemed scared to death at
us-or something what are you going
there for

  i saw da costa dart a furtive glance at
me it troubled me i had of course told
him nothing of the real reasons for my
journey stating simply when i had em-
ployed him that i wished to go to ponape
where the scientific work i had planned
might keep me many weeks what did
the man know i wondered and what was
the explanation of his remarks in the
cabin and of his manifest unease
okeefes sharp eyes had noted the glance
and misinterpreting it and my consequent
hesitation flushed in embarrassment

oh i beg your pardon he said
maybe i oughtnt to have asked that
its no secret lieutenant i replied

somewhat testily im about to undertake
some exploration work there a little dig-
ging among the ruins on the nan-matal

  i looked at the portuguese sharply as
i named the place i distinctly saw a pal-
lor creep under his skin and again he made
swiftly the sign of the cross glancing as
he did so uneasily to the north i made
up my mind then to question him when
opportunity came he turned from his
quick scrutiny of the sea and addressed
okeefe

  theres nothing on board to fit you
lieutenant he said looking over the tall
figure before him but perhaps we can
find something while your clothes dry
will you come to my cabin

  oh just give me a sheet to throw
around me captain said okeefe fol-
lowing him darkness had fallen and as
the two disappeared i softly opened the
door of my own cabin and listened i
could hear huldricksson breathing deeply

  i drew my electric flash and shielding
its rays from my face looked at him
his sleeping was changing from the heavy
stupor of the drug into one that was at
least on the borderland of the normal
satisfied as to his condition i returned
to deck

okeefe was there on deck looking
like a specter in the cotton sheet he
had wrapped about him a deck table had
been cleated down and one of the tonga
boys was setting it for our dinner soon
the very creditable larder of the suwarna
dressed the board and okeefe da costa
and i attacked it the night had grown
close and oppressive behind us the for-
ward light of the brunhilda glided and the
binnacle lamp threw up a faint glow in
which her black helmsmans face stood out
mistily okeefe had looked curiously a
number of times at our tow but had asked
no questions

  youre not the only passenger we
picked up today i told him we found
the captain of that sloop lashed to his
wheel nearly dead with exhaustion and
his boat deserted by every one except
himself
the conquest of the moon pool



  what was the matter asked okeefe
in astonishment

  we dont know i answered he
fought us and i had to drug him before
we could get him loose from his lashings
hes sleeping down in my berth now his
wife and little girl ought to have been
on board the captain here says but-
they werent

any signs of a fight asked okeefe
i shook my head and again i saw da
costa swiftly cross himself well have
to wait until he wakes up to get the story
i concluded

  wife and child gone said okeefe
and you saw nothing

  from the condition of his mouth he
must have been alone at the wheel and
without water at least two days and nights
before we found him i replied and as
for looking for anyone on these waters
after such a time its hopeless

  thats true said okeefe but his
wife and baby poor poor devil

  i watched okeefe as he talked feeling
my liking for him steadily increasing if
i could but have a man like this beside
me on the path of unknown peril upon
which i had set my feet i thought wist-
fully we sat and smoked a bit sipping
the coffee the portuguese made so well

  da costa at last relieved the cantonese
at the wheel okeefe and i drew chairs
up to the rail the brighter stars shone
out dimly through a hazy sky gleams of
phosphorescence tipped the crests of the
waves and sparkled with an almost angry
brilliance as the bow of the suwarna
tossed them aside far to the east a faint
silver glow heralded the rising moon
okeefe pulled contentedly at a cigarette
the glowing spark lighted the keen boyish
face and the blue eyes now black and
brooding under the spell of the tropic
night

  are you american or irish okeefe
i asked suddenly

  why he laughed

  because i answered from your
name and your service i would suppose
you irish but your command of pure
americanese makes me doubtful

  he grinned amiably

  ill tell you how that is he said my
mother is an american-a grace of vir-
ginia my father was okeefe of cole-
raine and these two loved each other so
well that the heart they gave me is half
irish and half american my father died
when i was sixteen i used to go to the
states with my mother every other year
for a month or two but after my father
died we used to go to ireland every other
year and there you are im as american
as i am irish

  when im in love or excited or
dreaming or mad i have the brogue but
for the every-day purposes of life i like
the united states talk and i know broad-
way as well as i do binevenagh lane and
the sound as well as st patricks chan-
nel educated a bit at eton a bit at ox-
ford a bit at harvard always too much
okeefe with grace money to have to make
any in love lots of times and never a
heartache after that wasnt a pleasant one
and never a real purpose in life until i
took the kings shilling and earned my
wings always ready for adventure-larry
okeefe

  but it was the irish okeefe who sat
out there waiting for the banshee i
laughed

  it was that he said somberly and i
heard the brogue creep over his voice like
velvet and his eyes grew brooding again
theres never an okeefe for these thou-
sand years that has passed without his
warning an twice have i heard the ban-
shee calling-once it was when my younger
brother died an once when my father lay
waiting to be carried out on the ebb tide

  he mused a moment then went on
an once i saw an annir choille a girl
of the green people flit like a shadow of
green fire through the carntogher woods
an once at dunchraig i slept where the
ashes of the dun of cormac macconcobar
are mixed with those of cormac an eilidh
the fair all burned in the nine flames that
sprang from the harping of cravetbeen
an i heard the echo of his dead harp-
ings-

  he paused again then softly with


famous fantastic mysteries

that curiously sweet high voice that only
the irish seem to have he sang

   woman of the white breasts eilidh
   woman of the gold-brown hair and lips
   of the red red rowan

  where is the swan that is whiter with
       breast more soft

  or the wave on ihe sea that moves as thou
       movest eilidh

chapter iv

olafs story

there was a little silence i looked
upon him with wonder clearly he
was in deepest earnest i know the psy-
chology of the gael is a curious one and
that deep in all their hearts their ancient
traditions and beliefs have strong and liv-
ing roots

  here was this soldier facing war and
all its ugly realities open-eyed and fear-
less picking indeed the most dangerous
branch of service for his own a modern
if ever there was one appreciative of most
unmystical broadway and yet soberly and
earnestly attesting to his belief in banshee
in shadowy people of the woods and phan-
tom harpers i wondered what he would
think if he could see the dweller and
then with a pang that perhaps his su-
perstitions might make him an easy prey

  for how then was i to have known that
larry okeefes childlike faith in the
existence of these fantasies of the gaelic
imagination was to prove not his weakness
but his strong buckler against creatures
that not even the imagination of his race
could conceive

  i looked eastward where the moon now
nearly a week past the full was mounting

  you cant make me see what youve
seen lieutenant i laughed but you can
make me hear ive always wondered what
kind of a noise a disembodied spirit could
possibly make without any vocal cords
or breath or any other earthly sound-pro-
ducing mechanism how does the banshee
sound

  okeefe did not laugh instead he
looked at me seriously

all right he said ill show you

from deep down in his throat came first
a low weird sobbing that mounted steadily
into a keening whose mournfulness made
my skin creep and then okeefes hand
shot out and gripped my shoulder and
i stiffened like stone in my chair-for from
behind us like an echo and then taking
up the cry swelled a wail that seemed to
hold within it a sublimation of the sor-
rows of centuries it gathered itself into
one heartbroken sobbing note and died
away okeefes grip loosened and he rose
swiftly to his feet

  its all right goodwin he said its
for me it found me all this way from
ireland

  there was no trace of fear in face or
voice buck up professor laughed
okeefe theres nothing for you to be
afraid of and never yet was there an
okeefe who feared the kind spirit that
carries the warnin

  again the silence was rent by the cry
but now i had located it it came from
my room and it could mean only one
thing huldricksson had wakened

  forget your banshee i gasped and
made a jump for the cabin

  out of the corner of my eye i noted a
look of half-sheepish relief flit over
okeefes face and then he was beside
me da costa shoutedan order from the
wheel the cantonese ran up and took it
from his hands and the little portuguese
pattered down toward us my hand on
the door ready to throw it open i stopped
what if the dweller were within what if
the new power i feared it had attained
had made it not only independent of place
but independent of that full flood of moon
ray which throckmartin had thought es-
sential to draw it from the blue pool

  the portuguese had paused too and
looking at him i saw my own cravenness
reflected now from within the sobbing
wail began once more to rise okeefe
pushed me aside and with one quick mo-
tion threw open the door and crouched
low within it i saw an automatic flash
dully in his hand saw it cover the cabin
from side to side following the swift sweep
the conquest of the moon pool



of his eyes around it then he straightened
and his face turned toward the berth was
filled with wondering pity

  da costa and i had stepped in behind
him through the window streamed a shaft
of the moonlight it fell upon huldricks-
sons staring eyes in them great tears
slowly gathered and rolled down his
cheeks from his opened mouth came the
woe-laden wailing i ran to the port and
drew the curtains da costa snapped the
lights

  the norsemans dolorous crying stopped
as abruptly as though cut his gaze rolled
toward us and then his whole body red-
dened with a shock of rage and at one
bound he broke through the strong leashes
 had buckled round him and faced us a
giant naked figure tense with wrath his
eyes glaring his yellow hair almost erect
with the force of the passion visibly surg-
ing through him da costa shrunk behind
me okeefe coolly watchful took a quick
step that brought him in front of me

  where do you take me said hul-
dricksson and his voice was thick as the
growl of a beast where is my boat

  i touched okeefe gently and stood in
front of the giant he glared at me and
i saw the muscles of the gigantic arms flex
and the hands below the bandaged wrist
clench he was berserk-mad

  listen olaf huldricksson i said
we take you to where the sparkling devil
took your helma and your freda we fol-
low the sparkling devil that came down
from the moon do you hear me i spoke
slowly distinctly striving to pierce the
mists that i knew swirled around the
strained brain and the words did pierce
he stared at me for a moment i heard
okeefe murmur good stuff thats the
idea humor him huldricksson stared at
me and thrust out a shaking hand as i
gripped it i saw his madness fade while
his great chest heaved and fell you say
you follow he asked falteringly you
know where to follow where it took my
helma and my little freda

  just that olaf huldricksson i an-
swered just that i pledge you my life
that i know

  da costa stepped forward he speaks
true olaf he said dr goodwin here
he follow as he say you go faster on the
suwarna than on the br-rw-anilda olaf
yes

  the giant norseman still gripping my
hand looked at him i know you da
costa he said you are all right ja
you are a fair man where is the brun-
hilda

  she follow beind on a big rope olaf
soothed the portuguese soon you see her
but now lie down an tell us if you can
why you tie yourself to your wheel an
what it is that happen olaf

  if youll tell us how the sparkling devil
came it will help us all when we get to
where it is huldricksson  said

  on okeefes face there was an expres-
sion of well-nigh ludicrous doubt and
amazement he glanced from one to the
other the giant shifted his own tense
look from me to the irishman i saw a
gleam of approval in his eyes he loosed
me and gripped okeefes arm staerkl
he said ja-strong and with a strong
heart a man-ja he comes too-we
shall need him-ja he turned toward
me i looked toward okeefe and saw his
doubt deepen

  he comes i said if he can

once more huldricksson searched me
with his glance once more turned
and absorbed okeefe in the icy blue of
his eyes

  a man ja he repeated he pointed to
me and you-a man ja but not the
same as him-and me

  i tell he said and seated himself on
the side of the bunk it was four nights
ago my freda-his voice shook-mine
yndling she loved the moonlight i was
at the wheel and my freda and my helma
they were behind me the moon was be-
hind us and the brunhilda was like a swan-
boat sailing down with the moonlight send-
ing her ja

  i heard my freda say i see a nisse
coming down the track of the moon and
i hear her mother laugh low like a mother
does when her yndling dreams i was


famous fantastic mysteries

happy that night with my helma and my
freda and the brunhilda sailing like a
swan-boat ja i heard the child say the
nisse comes fast and then i heard a
scream from my helma a great scream-
like a mare when her foal is torn from
her i spun round fast ja i dropped the
wheel and spun fast i saw- he covered
his eyes with his hands

   the portuguese had crept close to me
and  heard him panting like a frightened
dog okeefe immobile watched the
norseman narrowly his hand fell and hate
crept into his eyes a bitter hate that
winged and white-hot hate that makes even
the gods tremble

   i saw a white fire spring over the rail
whispered olaf huldricksson it whirled
round and round and it shone like-like
stars in a whirlwind mist there was a
noise in my ears it sounded like bells-
little bells ja like the music you make
when you run your finger round goblets
it made me sick and dizzy the bells noise

  my helma was-indeholde-what you
say-in the middle of the white fire she
turned her face to me and she turned it on
the child and my helmas face burned into
my heart because it was full of fear and
it was full of happiness-of glyaede i tell
you that the fear in my helmas face made
me ice here-he beat his breast with
clenched hand-but the happiness in it
burned on me like fire and i could not
move

   i said in here-he touched his head-
i said it is loki come out of helvede
but he cannot take my helma for christ
lives and loki has no power to hurt my
helma or my frede christ lives christ
lives i said but the sparkling devil did
not let my helma go it drew her to the
rail half over it i saw her eyes upon the
child and a little she broke away and
reached to it and my freda jumped into
her arms and the fire wrapped them both
and they were gone a little i saw them
whirling on the moon track behind the
brunhilda and they were gone

   the sparkling devil took them loki
was loosed and he had power i turned

the brunhilda and i followed where my
helma and mine yndling had gone my
boys crept up and asked me to turn again
but i would not they dropped a boat and
left me i steered straight on the path i
lashed my hands to the wheel that sleep
might not loose them  steered on and
on and on-

  where was the god i prayed when my
wife and child were taken cried olaf
huldricksson-and it was as though i
heard throckmartin three years before
asking that same bitter question i have
left him as he left me ja i pray now to
thor and to odin who can fetter loki
he sank back covering again his eyes

  olaf i said what you have called the
sparkling devil has taken ones dear to me
i too was following it when we found
you you shall go with me to its home
and there we will try to take from it your
wife and child and my friends as well but
now that you may be strong for what is
before us you must sleep again

  you speak the truth he said at last
slowly i will do what you say

  he stretched out an arm at my bidding
i gave him a second injection he lay back
and soon he was sleeping i turned toward
da costa his face was livid and sweat-
ing and he was trembling pitifully
okeefe stirred

  you did that mighty well dr good-
win he said so well that i almost be-
lieved you myself

  what did you think of his story mr
okeefe i asked

  his answer was almost pitifully brief
and colloquial

  nuts he said i was a little shocked
i admit i think hes crazy dr good-
win he corrected himself quickly what
else could i think

  i turned to the little portuguese without
answering

  theres no need for any anxiety to-
night captain i said take my word for
it you need some rest yourself shall i
give you a sleeping draft

  i do wish you would dr goodwin
sair he answered gratefully tomorrow
the conquest of the moon pool



when i feel bettair i would have a talk
with you

  i nodded he had known something
then i mixed him an opiate of consider-
able strength he bowed and went to his
own cabin

  i locked the door behind him and then
sitting beside the sleeping norseman i told
okeefe my story from end to end he
asked few questions as t spoke only
watched me with a somewhat disconcert-
ing intensity in the main his inquiries
dealt with the sound phenomena accom-
panying the apparition of the dweller he
made a few somewhat startling interrup-
tions dealing with throckmartins psychol-
ogy and after i had finished he cross-
examined me rather minutely upon my
recollections of the radiant phases upon
each appearance checking these with
throckmartins observations of the same
activities in the chamber of the moon
pool

  and now what do you think of it all
 asked

  he sat silent for a while

  not what you seem to think dr good-
win he answered at last gravely let
me sleep over it and like the captain
ill tell you tomorrow one thing of course
is certain-you and your friend throck-
martin and this man here saw-something
but-he was silent again and then con-
tinued with a kindness that i found
vaguely irritating-but ive noticed that
when a scientist gets superstitious it-er-
takes very hard

  heres a few things i can tell you now
though went on okeefe while i
struggled to speak i pray in my heart
that the old dolphin is so busy shell for-
get me for a while and that we wont
meet anything with wireless on board her
going up because dr goodwin id dearly
love to take a crack at your dweller

  and another thing said larry
okeefe after this cut out the trim-
mings doc and call me plain larry for
whether i think youre crazy or whether
i dont youre there with the nerve pro-
fessor and im for you

  good night said larry okeefe and
took himself out to the deck hammock he
had insisted upon having slung for him
refusing the captains importunities to use
his own cabin

  and it was with extremely mixed emo-
tions as to his compliment that i watched
him go superstitious i whose pride was
my scientific devotion to fact and fact
alone superstitious-and this from a man
who believed in banshees and ghostly
harpers and irish wood nymphs and no
doubt in leprechawns and all their tribe

  half laughing half irritated and wholly
happy in even the part promise of larry
okeefes comradeship on my venture i
arranged a couple of pillows stretched
myself out on two chairs and took up my
vigil beside olaf huldricksson

chapter v

a lost page of earth

when i awakened the sun was
streaming through the cabin port-
hole outside a fresh voice lilted i lay
on my two chairs and listened the song
was one with the wholesome sunshine and
the breeze blowing stiffly and whipping the
curtains it was larry okeefe at his
matins

  i opened my door okeefe stood out-
side laughing behind him the tonga boys
clustered wide-toothed and adoring even
the cantonese mate had something on his
face that served for a grin and da costa
was beaming i closed the door behind me

  the sicwarna her engines silent was
making fine headway under all sail the
brunhilda skipping in her wake cheer-
fully with half her canvas up

  the sea was crisping and dimpling under
the wind blue and white was the world
as far as the eye could reach schools of
little silvery green flying fish broke through
the water rushing on each side of us
flashed for an instant and were gone
behind us gulls hovered and dipped the
shadow of mystery had retreated far over
the rim of this wide awake and beautiful
world and if subconsciously i knew that


famous fantastic mysteries

somewhere it was brooding and waiting for
a little while at least i was consciously
free of its oppression

  hows the patient asked okeefe

  he was answered by huldricksson him-
self who must have risen just as i left
the cabin the great norseman had slipped
on a pair of pajamas and giant torso naked
under the sun he strode out upon us
we all of us looked at him a trifle
anxiously but olafs madness had left
him his face was still drawn and in his
eyes was much sorrow but the berserk
rage had vanished he stretched out a
hand to us in turn

  this is dr goodwin olaf said da
costa an this is lieutenant okeefe
of the english navy

  huldricksson bowed with a touch of
grace that revealed him not all rough sea-
man-and indeed as i was later to find
the norwegian had been given gentle up-
bringing and a fair education before the
wanderlust of his race had swept him into
these far seas

  he addressed himself straight to me
you said last night we follow

  i nodded

  it is where he asked again

  we go first to ponape and from there
to metalanim harbor-to the nan-matal
you know the place

  huldricksson bowed a white gleam as
of ice showing in his blue eyes

  it is there he asked

  it is there that we must first search
i answered

  good said olaf huldricksson it is
good

  he looked at da costa inquiringly and
the little portuguese following his thought
answered his unspoken question

  we should be at ponape tomorrow
morning early olaf

  good repeated the norseman he
looked away his eyes tear filled

  a restraint fell upon us the embarrass-
ment all men experience when they feel
a great sympathy and a great pity neither
of which they quite know how to give
expression by silent consent we discussed

at breakfast only the most casual topics

  when the meal was over huldricksson
expressed a desire to go aboard the brun-
hilda

  the suwarna hove to and da costa and
he dropped into the small boat when they
reached the brunhildas deck i saw olaf
take the wheel and the two fall into earnest
talk i beckoned to okeefe and we
stretched ourselves out on the bow hatch
under cover of the foresail he lighted
a cigarette took a couple of leisurely puffs
and looked at me expectantly

  well i asked and what do you
think of it now

  well said okeefe suppose you tell
me what you think and then ill proceed
to point out your scientific errors his
eyes twinkled mischievously

t think i said it is possible that
 some members of that race peopling
the ancient continent which we know ex-
isted here in the pacific and which was
destroyed by a comparatively gradual sub-
sidence have survived we know that
many of these islands are honey-combed
with caverns and vast subterranean spaces
too great to be so called these are liter-
ally underground lands running in many
cases far out beneath the ocean floor it
is possible that for some reason the sur-
vivors of this race of which i speak sought
refuge in these abysmal spaces one of
whose entrances is on the island where
throckmartins party met its end

  as for their persistence in these cav
erns we know the lost people possessed
a high science this is indisputable it
may be that they had gone far in their
mastery of certain universal forms of
energy they may have discovered the
secret of that form of magnetic etheric
vibration we call light if so they would
have had no difficulty in maintaining life
down there and indeed shielded by
earths crust from the natural forces which
always have surface man more or less at
their mercy they may have developed a
civilization and extended a science im-
mensely more advanced than ours and
the conquest of the moon pool



unless they have also developed a complete
indifference to conquest and an inflexible
determination never to come forth from
their world they must always continue to
be a potential menace to our world

  i paused his keen face was now all
eager attention

  have you ever heard of the chamats
i asked him he shook his head

  in papua i explained there is a
widespread and immeasurably old tradi-
tion that imprisoned under the hills is
a race of giants who once ruled this region
when it stretched from sun to sun and
before the moon god drew the waters
over it-i quote from the legend not
only in papua but in borneo and java and
in fact throughout malaysia you find this
story and so the tradition runs these
people-the chamats-will one day break
through the hills and rule the world
make over the world is the literal transla-
tion of the constant phrase in the tale
does this convey anything to you larry
something he nodded go on

  it conveys something to me i said
especially in the light of what throck-
martin heard and saw and what huldricks-
son and i witnessed

  it is possible that these survivors are
experimenting with their science and that
what i call the dweller is one of their
results or it may be that the phenomenon
is something that they created long ago
and control of which they may have lost
or again it may be some unknown energy
that they found when they entered their
subterranean realm and which they have
learned to control or which controls them

  this much is sure-the moon door
which is clearly operated by the action
of moonlight upon some unknown element
or combination in much the same way
that the metal selenium functions under
sun rays or the electric light and the crys-
tals through which the moon rays pour
down upon the pool their prismatic col-
umns are humanly made mechanisms

  set within the ruins they would seem
to argue for the ancientness of the work
but who can tell when moon door and

 moon lights were set in their places
 nevertheless so long as they are humanly
 made and so long as it is this flood of
 moonlight from which the dweller draws
 its power of materialization the dweller
 itself if not the product of the human
 mind is at least dependent upon the prod-
 uct of the human mind for its appearance

   my pride in this analysis was short
 lived

   wait a minute goodwin said okeefe
 do you mean to say you think that this
 thing is made of-well of moonshine

   moonlight i replied is of course
 reflected sunlight but the rays which pass
 back to earth after their impact on the
 moons surface are profoundly changed
 the spectroscope shows that they lose
 practically all the slower vibrations we

	call red and infra-red while the extremely
 rapid vibrations we call the violet and
 ultra-violet are accelerated and altered
 many scientists hold that there is an
 unknown element in the moon-perhaps
 that which makes the gigantic luminous
 trails that radiate in all directions from
 the lunar crater tycho-whose energies
 are absorbed by and carried on the moon
 rays

   at any rate whether by the loss of
 the vibrations of the red or by the addi-
 tion of this mysterious force the light of
 the moon becomes something entirely dif-
 ferent from mere modified sunlight-just
 as the addition or subtraction of one other
 chemical in a compound of several makes
 the product a substance with entirely dif-
 ferent energies and potentialities

   now these rays are given perhaps still
 another mysterious activity by the trans-
 parent globes through which throck-
 martin told me they passed in the cham-
 ber of the moon pool and whose colors
 they take the result is the necessary fac-
 tor in the formation of the dweller there
 would be nothing scientifically improbable
 in such a process larry

   we know the extraordinary effect of
 the finsen rays which are only the con-
 centration of the chemical energies in the
 green and blue of the spectrum upon


famous fantastic mysteries

malignant cell growths in the human body
and we know that the x-ray can dissolve
the normal barrier of matter for us making
the solid transparent we do not begin
to know how to harness the potentialities
of light this hidden race may have
learned and learning may have created
forms with powers undreamed by us

t isten doc said larry earnestly
- ill take everything you say about
this lost continent the people who used to
live on it and their caverns for granted
but by the sword of brian boru youll
never get me to fall for the idea that a
bunch of moonshine can handle a big
woman such as you say throckmartins
thora was nor a two-fisted man such as
you say throckmartin was youll never
get me to believe that any bunch of con-
centrated moonshine could handle them
and take them waltzing off along a moon-
beam back to wherever it goes no doc
not on your life

  ive told you that what you call moon-
shine is an aggregate of vibrations with
immense potential power larry i an-
swered considerably irritated what we
call matter is nothing but a collection of
infinitely small particles of electricity-
electrons and the way the electrons are
grouped makes of matter man or wood or
metal or stone light is a magnetic vibra-
tion of the ether and is probably com-
posed of similar particles of electricity
but functioning in another way from the
particles that make matter learn the
secret of making light and you come close
to learning the secret of matter

  why if you could take all the energy
out of the sunshine that in one minute
covers one square foot of earth you could
blast all of earth to bits and your won-
derful radio is nothing but vibrations yet
it carries words around the world with
almost the speed of light itself-

no he interrupted youre wrong
all right okeefe i answered now
very much irritated indeed whats your
theory and i could not resist adding
fairies

    professor he grinned if its a fairy
 its irish and when it sees me itll be so
 glad therell be nothing to it i was lost
 strayed or stolen larry avick itll say
 an i was so homesick for the old sod i
 was desprit itll say an take me back
 quick before i do any more har-rm itll
 tell me-an thats the truth

    i forgot my chagrin in our laughter

    but ill tell you what i think he said
 soberly back at the first battle of the
 marne there were any number of english-
 men who thought they saw the old archers
 of crecy and agincourt dead these half
 dozen centuries twanging phantom
 bows and shooting down the enemy by the
 hundred and you can find thousands of
 frenchmen who saw joan of arc and na-
 poleon regularly its what the doctors

	call collective hallucination somebody sees
  something a little queer his imagination
  gets to work hard because his nerves are
  pretty well strained anyway he says to
  the next fellow dont you see it and
  the next fellow says sure i see it too
  and there you are-bowmen of mons st
  george on his white horse joan in armor
  and all the rest of it

   if you think that explains throck-
 martin and myself how do you explain
 huldricksson who never saw throck-
 martin and didnt see me before the thing
 came to the brunhildav i asked with i
 admit some heat

   now dont get me wrong replied
 larry i believe you all saw something
 all right but what i think you saw was
 some kind of gas all this region is vol-
 canic and islands and things are constantly
 poking up from the sea its probably gas
 a volcanic emanation something new to us
 and that drives you crazy-lots of kinds
 of gas do that

    it hit the throckmartin party on that
 island and they probably were all more
 or less delirious all the time thought they
 saw things talked it over and-collective
 hallucination when they got it bad they
 most likely jumped overboard one by one
 huldricksson sails into a place where it
 is and it hits his wife she grabs the child
the conquest of the moon pool



and jumps overboard maybe the moon
rays make it luminous

  but that doesnt explain the moon door
and the phenomena of the lights in the
chamber of the pool i said at last

  you havent seen them have you
asked larry and throckmartin admitted
he was pretty nearly crazy when he
thought he did well

  for a time i was silent

  larry i said at last whether you
are right or i am right i must go to the
nan-matal will you go with me larry
goodwin he replied i surely will
im as interested as you are if im re-
ported dead for a while theres nobody
to care so thats all right only old man
be reasonable youve thought over this
so long youre going bugs honestly you
are

  and again the gladness that i might
have larry okeefe with me was so great
that i forgot to be angry

chapter vi

  the moon door opens-and shuts

da costa who had come aboard un-
noticed by either of us now tapped
me on the arm

  doctair goodwin he said can i see
you in my cabin sair

  at last then he was going to speak
i followed him

  doctair he said when we had en-
lered this is a veree strange thing that
has happened to olaf veree strange an
the natives of ponape they have been very
much excite lately an none go near the
nan-matal now for they say the spirits
have got great power and are angree be-
cause of that othair partee which they
take

  of what they fear i know nothing
nothing again that quick furtive cross-
ing of himself but this i have  tell
you there came to me from ranaloa last
month a man a german a doctair like
you his name it was von hetzdorp i
take him to ponape an the natives there
they will not take him to the nan-matal

where he wish to go so i take him we
leave in a boat with much instrument care-
fully tied up i leave him there wit the
boat an the food he tell me to tell no
one an pay me not to but you are a
friend an olaf he depend much upon you
an so i tell you sair

  you know nothing more than this da
costa i asked youre sure

  nothing nothing more he answered
but i was not so sure later i told
okeefe

  the next morning we raised ponape
without further incident and before noon
the suwarna and the brunhilda had
dropped anchor in the harbor upon the
excitement and manifest dread of the na-
tives when we sought among them for
carriers and workmen to accompany us
i will not dwell no payment we offered
would induce a single one of them to go
to the nan-matal nor would they say
why

  they were sullen and panicky and i
think the most disconcerting thing of all
in their attitude was the open relief they
showed when they learned that a british
warship might steam in seekingokeefe
it indicated that their fear was deep-rooted
and real indeed

  we piled the longboat up with my in-
struments and food and camping equip-
ment the suwarna took us around to
metalanim harbor and there with the
tops of ancient sea walls deep in the blue
water beneath us and the ruins looming
up out of the mangroves a scant mile from
us left us

  da costas anxiety and uneasiness were
almost pitiful there were tears in the eyes
of the little portuguese when he bade us
farewell invoking all the saints to stand
by and protect us and the sorrow in his
face and the fervor of his parting grip
were eloquent of his conviction that never
again would he behold us

  then with huldricksson manipulating
our small sail and larry at the rudder
we rounded the titanic wall that swept
down into the depths passed monoliths
standing like gigantic sentinels upon its


famous fantastic mysteries

shattered verge we turned at last into
the canal that throckmartin on his map
had marked as the passage which led
straight to that place of ancient mysteries
where the moon door is portal of that
dread chamber wherein the dweller made
itself manifest

  and as we entered that channel we were
enveloped by a silence a silence so in-
tense so weighted that it seemed to have
substance an alien silence that clung
and stifled and still stood aloof from us
the living

  standing down in the chambered depths
of the great pyramid i had known some-
thing of such silence but never such in-
tensity as this larry felt it and i saw
him look at me askance if olaf sitting in
the bow felt it too he gave no sign his
blue eyes with again the glint of ice
within them watched the channel before us

  as we passed there arose upon our left
sheer walls of black basalt blocks cyclo-
pean towering fifty feet or more broken
here and there by the sinking of their deep
foundations and only where they had so
broken had the hand of time been able
to crumble them from these dark ram-
parts the silence seemed to ooze and my
skin crept as though from hidden places
in them scores of eyes ages dead peered
out at us like ghosts of a lost atlantis

  in front of us the mangroves widened
out and filled the canal on our right the
lesser walls of tau somber blocks
smoothed and squared and set with a cold
mathematical nicety that filled me with
vague awe slipped by through breaks
i caught glimpses of dark ruins and of
great fallen stones that seemed to crouch
and menace us as we passed somewhere
there hidden were the seven globes that
poured the moon fire down upon the moon
pool

  now we were among the mangroves and
sail down the three of us pushed and
pulled the boat through their tangled roots
and branches the noise of our passing
split the silence like a profanation and
from the ancient bastions came murmurs
-forbidding strangely sinister and now

we were through floating on a little open
space of shadow-filled water before us
lifted the gateway of nan-tanach gigan-
tic broken incredibly old shattered por-
tals through which had passed men and
women of earths dawn old with a weight
of years that pressed leadenly upon the
eyes that looked upon it and yet in some
curious indefinable way-menacingly de-
fiant

  beyond the gate back from the portals
stretched a flight of enormous basalt slabs
a giants stairway indeed and from each
side of it marched the high walls that
were the dwellers pathway none of us
spoke as we grounded the boat and
dragged it up upon a half-submerged pier

  what next whispered larry at last

  i think we ought to take a look
around i replied in the same low tones
well climb the wall here and take a
flash about the whole place ought to be
plain as day from that height

  huldricksson his blue eyes alert
nodded with the greatest of difficulty we
clambered up the broken blocks the
giant norseman at times lifting me like
a child and stood at last upon the broad
top from this vantage-point not only the
whole of nan-tanach but all of the nan-
matal lay at our feet

to the east and south of us set like
childrens blocks in the midst of the
sapphire sea were dozens of islets none
of them covering more than two square
miles of surface each of them a perfect
square or oblong within its protecting
walls behind these walls were grouped
ruins-houses temples palaces all the
varying abodes of men on none was there
sign of life save for a few great birds
that hovered here and there and gulls
dipping in the blue waves beyond

  we turned our gaze down upon the
island on which we stood it was i esti-
mated about three-quarters of a mile
square the sea wall enclosed it like the
sides of a gigantic box it was really an
enormous basalt-sided open cube and
within it two other open cubes the en-
the conquest of the moon pool



closure between the first and second wall
was stone paved with here and there a
broken pillar and long stone benches

  the hibiscus the aloe-tree and a num-
ber of small shrubs had found place but
seemed only to intensify its stark loneli-
ness it came to me that this had been
the assembling place of those who thou-
sands upon thousands of years ago had
gathered within this citadel of mystery
beyond the wall that was its farther boun-
dary was a second enclosure littered with
broken pillars fragments of stone and nu-
merous small structures and the second
enclosures limit was the third wall a
terrace not more than twenty feet high
within it was what had been without
doubt the heart of nan-tanach-an open
space three hundred feet square at each
of its corners a temple

  directly before us black and staring like
an eyeless socket was the entrance to the
treasure-house of chau-ta-leur the sun
king the blocks that had formed its doors
lay shattered beside it and opposite it
should be if throckmartins story had not
been a dream the gray slab he had named
the moon door

  wonder where the german fellow can
be asked larry

  i shook my head there was no sign of
life here had von hetzdorp gone or had
the dweller taken him too whatever had
happened there was no trace of him below
us or on any of the islets within our range
of vision we scrambled down the side
of the gateway olaf looked at me wist-
fully

  we start the search now olaf i said
and first okeefe let us see whether
the gray stone is really here after that
we will set up camp and while i unpack
you and olaf search the island it wont
take long

  larry gave a look at his service auto-
matic and grinned we made our way up
the steps through the outer enclosures
and into the central square i confess to
a fire of scientific curiosity and eagerness
tinged with a dread that okeefes analysis
might be true would we find the mov-

ing slab and if so would it be as throck-
martin had described it so then even
larry would have to admit that here
was something that theories of gases
and luminous emanations would not
explain and the first test of the whole
amazing story would be passed but if
not-

  and there before us the faintest tinge
of gray setting it apart from its neighbor-
ing blocks of basalt was the moon door

  there was no mistaking it this was
in very deed the portal through which dr
throckmartin had seen pass that glori-
ously dreadful apparition he called the
dweller through it the dweller had borne
in an embrace of living light first thora
mrs throckmartins maid and then dr
stanton his youthful colleague and
through it at last had gone throckmartin
down the shining tunnel beyond whose
luminous lure led to that enchanted cham-
ber into which streamed the seven moon
torrents that drew the dweller from the
wondrous pool that was its lair

  across its threshold had raced edith
throckmartin my lost friends young
bride fearlessly flying down that haunted
passage to aid her husband in his fruit-
less fight against the thing-and out of
it he himself had rushed a mercilful dark-
ness shrouding consciousness and sight
after he had watched her sink slowly sink
down through the blue waters of the moon
pool wrapped in the dwellers coruscating
folds to-what

  and then there seemed to drift out
through the stone to face me that inex-
plicable being of swirling spiraling plumes
and jets of sparkling opalescence of
crystal sweet chimings of murmuring sigh-
ings that throckmartin had told me
stamped upon the faces of its prey wedded
anguish and rapture terror and ecstasy
commingled joy of heaven and agony of
hell the seal of god and devil monstrously
mated the thing that my own eyes had
seen clasp throckmartin in our cabin of
the southern queen and draw him swiftly
down the moon path

  what was that portal more enigmatic


famous fantastic mysteries

than was ever sphinx and wrhat lay be-
yond it what did that smooth stone
whose wan deadness whispered of ages old
corridors of time opening out into alien
unimaginable vistas bide it had cost
the world of science throckmartins great
brain as it had cost throckmartin those
he loved it had drawn me to it in search
of throckmartin and its shadow had fal-
len upon the soul of olaf the norseman
and upon what thousands upon thousands
more i wondered since the brains that
had conceived it had vanished

  did the dweller lurk behind it in wait
for us when we found its open-sesame
would we find within truths of our worlds
youth to which the riches of ali babas
cave were but dross was there that with-
in which would force science to recast its
hard won theories of humanity of its evo-
lution of its painful progress from brute
to what we call man or would we loose
upon the world some nameless blasting
evil some survival of our planets night-
mare hours some supernormal inhuman
thing spawned by unthinkable travail in
a hidden cavern of mother earth

  a barrier of unknown stone-fifteen feet
high and ten feet wide and yet it might
bar the way to a lost paradise or hold
back a hell undreamed by even cruelest
brains  what lay beyond it

swiftly the thoughts raced through
my mind as i stood staring at the
gray slab and then through me passed a
wave of weakness and not until then
did i realize the intense subconscious
anxiety that had possessed me

  i stretched out a shaking hand and
touched the surface of the slab a faint
thrill passed through my hand and arm
oddly unfamiliar and as oddly pleasant
as of electric contact holding the very
essence of cold okeefe watching imi-
tated my action as his fingers rested on
the stone his face filled with astonishment
in huldrickssons eyes was mingled hope
and despair i beckoned him he laid a
hand on the slab and swiftly withdrew it
but  saw the despair die from his face

leaving only eagerness a sudden hope

  it is the door he said i nodded
there was a low whistle of astonishment
from okeefe and he pointed up toward
the top of the gray stone i followed the
gesture and saw above the moon door
and on each side of it two gently curving
bosses of rock perhaps a foot in diameter

  the moon doors keys i said

  it begins to look so answered larry
if we can find them he added

  theres nothing we can do till moon-
rise i replied and weve none too much
time to prepare as it is come

  but stark lonely as was that place i
felt as we passed out as though eyes were
upon me watching with an intensity of
malevolence a bitter hatred olaf must
have felt it too for i saw him glance
sharply around and his face hardened
i said nothing however nor did he and
a little later we were beside our boat
wte lightered it set up the tent and as
it was now but a short hour to sundown
i told them to leave me and make their
search they went off together and i
busied myself with opening some of the
paraphernalia i had brought with me

  first of all i took out two becquerel
ray-condensers that i had bought in new
york their lenses would collect and in-
tensify to the fullest extent any light di-
rected upon them i had found them most
useful in making spectroscopic analysis of
luminous vapors and i knew that at
yerkes observatory splendid results had
been obtained from them in collecting the
diffused radiance of the negulae for the
same purpose

  it was my theory that the mechanism
operating the moon door responded only
to the force of the full light of the moon
shining through the seven little circles
which throckmartin had discovered set
within each of the bosses above it just as
the dweller could materialize only under
the same full-moon force shining through
the varicolored lights obviously the time
then of the doors opening and the phe-
nomenons materialization must coincide

  with the moon only a few days past
the conquest of the moon pool



its full it was practically certain that by
setting the becquerel condensers above the
bosses i could concentrate enough light
upon the circles to set the opening mechan-
ism in motion and as the ray stream from
the waning moon was insufficient to ener-
gize the pool we could enter the chamber
free from any fear of encountering its
tenant make our preliminary observations
and go forth before the satellite had
dropped so far that the concentration in
the condensers would fall below that neces-
sary to keep the slab from closing

  i took out also a small spectroscope
easily carried and a few other small in-
struments for the analysis of certain light
manifestations and the testing of metal and
liquid finally i put aside my emergency
medical kit

  i had hardly finished examining and ad-
justing these before okeefe and hul-
dricksson returned they reported signs of
a camp at least ten days old beside the
northern wall of the outer court but be-
yond that no evidence of others beyond
ourselves on nan-tanach moonrise would
not occur until nine-thirty and until then
there was no use of attacking the moon
door

  we prepared supper ate and talked a
little but for the most part were silent
even larrys high spirits were not in evi-
dence half a dozen times i saw him take
out his automatic and look it over he
was more thoughtful than i had ever seen
him once he went into the tent rum-
maged about a bit and brought out an-

other revolver which he said he had got
from da costa and a half-dozen clips
of cartridges he passed the gun to ojaf

  at last a glow in the southeast heralded
the rising moon i picked up my instru-
ments and the medical kit larry and olaf
shouldered each a short ladder that was
part of my equipment with our electric
flashes pointing the way we walked up the
great stairs through the enclosures and
straight to the gray stone

  by this time the moon had risen and
its clipped light shone full upon the slab
i saw faint gleams pass over it as of fleet-
ing phosphorescence but so faint were
they that i could not be sure of the truth
of my observation the base of the gray
stone bisected a curious cuplike depres-
sion whose perfectly rounded sides were
as smooth as though they had been pol-
ished by a jeweler this half cup was at
its deepest two and a half feet and its
lip joined the basalt pavement four feet
from the barrier of the great slab

we set the ladders in place olaf
i assigned to stand before the door
and watch for the first signs of its open-
ing-if open it should-and the big sailor
accepted the post eagerly thinking i sup-
pose that it would bring him nearer the
loved ones he now was sure were within
the becquerals were set within three-inch
tripods whose feet i had equipped with
vacuum rings to enable them to hold fast
to the rock

  i scaled one ladder and fastened a con-

many never suspect
       cause of backaches

            this old treatment often brings happy relief

many sufferers relieve nagging backache
quickly once they discover that the real cause
of their trouble may be tired kidneys

the kidneys are natures chief way of tak-
ing the excess acids and waste out of the blood

most people pass about  pints a day or about
 pounds of waste

frequent or scanty passages with smarting
and burning shows there may be something
wrong with your kidneys or bladder

an excess of acids or poisons in your blood

 when due to functional kidney disorders may
 be the cause of nagging backache rheumatic
 pains leg pains loss of pep and energy getting
 up nights swelling puffiness under the eyes
 headaches and dizziness

   dont wait ask your druggist for doans
 pills used successfully by millions for over 
 years they give happy relief and will help the
  miles of kidney tubes flush out poisonous
 waste from your blood get doans pills

denser over the boss descended sent
larry up to watch it and ascending the
sccond ladder rapidly fixed the other in
 nlare then with okeefe watchful on
his perch i on mine and olafs eyes fixed
ipuii me moon door we began our vigil
suddenly there was an exclamation from
larry

  seven little lights are beginning to glow
on this stone goodwin he cried

  but i had already seen those beneath
my lens begin to gleam out with a silvery
luster swiftly the rays within the con-
denser began to thicken and increase and
as they did so the seven small circles
waxed like stars growing out of the dusk
and with a queer-curdled is the best word
i can find to define it-luster entirely
strange to me

  i placed a finger upon one of them and
received a shock such as i had felt on
touching the moon door only greatly in-
tensified clearly a current of some kind
was set up within the substance when the
moonlight fell upon it and now the lights
were glowing steadily beneath me i heard
a faint sighing murmur and then the voice
of huldricksson

	it opens-the stone turns-

  i began to climb down the ladder
again came olafs voice

  the stone-it is open- and then a
shriek that came from the very core of
his heart a wail of blended anguish and
pity of rage and despair-and the sound
of swift footsteps racing through the wall
beneath me

  i dropped to the ground the moon door
was wide open and through it i caught
a glimpse of a corridor filled with a faint
pearly vaporous light like earliest misty
dawn but of olaf i could see nothing
and even as i stood gaping from behind

me came the sharp crack of a rifle i saw
the glass of the condenser at larrys side
flash and fly into fragments saw him drop
swiftly to the ground and the automatic
in his hand flash once twice into the
darkness

  saw too the moon door begin to pivot
slowly slowly back into its place

  i rushed toward the turning stone with
the wild idea of holding it open as i
thrust my hands against it there came at
my back a snarl and an oath and larry
staggered under the impact of a body that
had flung itself straight at his throat he
reeled at the lip of the shallow cup at
the base of the slab slipped upon its pol-
ished curve fell and rolled with that which
had attacked him kicking and writhing
straight through the narrowing portal into
the mistily luminous passage

  forgetting all else i sprang with a cry
to his aid and as i leaped i felt the clos-
ing edge of the moon door graze my side
and then as larry raised a fist brought
it down upon the temple of the man who
had grappled with him and rose from the
twitching body unsteadily to his feet i
heard shuddering past me a mournful whis-
per spun about as though some giant hand
had whirled me-and stood so rigid ap-
palled

  for the end of the corridor no longer
opened out into the moonlit square of
ruined nan-tanach it was barred by a
solid mass of glimmering stone the moon
door had closed

  and where was olaf huldricksson and
who was the man at our feet who had
brought this calamity down upon us and
what were we to do prisoned and my
bewildered brain told me hopelessly
prisoned without food in the very lair

upper broadway drowsed lazily
through the heat of the july aft-
ernoon a policeman taking ad-
vantage of a momentary lull in the rush
of traffic paused to mop his forehead and
scan the blue sky above him

  high up over the roofs of the buildings
floated a toy balloon its bright green color
plainly seen even at that height the
officer grinned as he speculated over the
mental anguish of the child who must
have lost it

  the whirl of traffic closed in again and
for two hours the officer guided cars and
pedestrians then came another break
and as before he brushed his handkerchief
across his forehead and scanned the
heavens

  two hours and yet the balloon was still
there holding the same relative position
except that it was nearer bigger out of
all proportion to the size of the ordinary
toy type the officer let several cars pass
unheeded while he tried to discover how
a balloon could float freely and still beat
up against the wind for certainly it was
moving toward him in spite of the breeze
at his back

  the officer was not the only person in
new york who was puzzled by the actions
of the green sphere from all parts of the
city people watched wondering what sort
of an advertising project they were wit-
nessing

  evening came on and still that gayly
colored globe hung over the city motion-

no furtner warning

less now night-and it stood outlined
against the sky like a phosphorescent
moon lighted by some sort of shifting fit-
ful flame that seemed to come from within
and swirl up over its surface

  from the harbor a brilliant pencil of
light shot out circled around and then
up coming to rest on the strange object
then new york fairly rubbed its eyes

  it was gone the beam from the search-
light swept here and there trying to point
it out again but to no avail

  suddenly from far above came an an-
swering beam a thin thread-like stream
of green in eerie fashion the beam short-
ened and lengthened swept around in a
wide arc and then pointed straight down
at the figure of liberty

  a slight greenish glow surrounded the
upper part of the statue

  the harbor searchlight circled to bear
on the figure and the watchers gasped
liberty was broken the entire head and
half the torso had disappeared the remain-
ing part standing there with the search-
light playing up and down its shortened
length

  there had been no noise no crash

  half the statue of liberty had simply
vanished

  up to that point curiosity had held the
city in its grip now fear took its place

  telephone and telegraph lines hummed
with the news of the vandalism and out
over the harbor that phosphorescent globe
suddenly became visible again

 an hour-two hours passed from
mineola two huge armored bombers took
off into the air and winged toward the
scene of the disturbance by the noise of
the motors and the flare of the exhausts the
populace followed the flight of the air-
planes over the city out over the harbor
straight toward that shining globe

  the bombers cut a wide circle around
their objective and then the roar of the
motors became interspersed with the rattle
of machine gun fire

  the globe moved dropped swiftly until
it rode just over the crests of the waves
then shot straight up with bewildering

the green globe rose high over the harbor
and the city held its breath

 speed from the bottom of the craft crept a
 short green ray that grew and lengthened
 whipping here and there until it found its
 mark

   the same greenish glow that had sur-
 rounded the statue enveloped one of the
 bombers its motor became silent

   it was gone the other gave a final
 burst from its machine gun and fled

   the globe did not pursue there was
 no need that green ray flashed around
 toward the machine hesitated came to rest
 and then lengthened its tip touched the
 airplane and like its mate it vanished
 with that same greenish haze as the only
 sign of its passing

 the sun rose over a disorganized city
 people half-heartedly started toward
 their work some of the more hardy souls
 carried on as before but the great ma-
 jority were held by the fear of the un-
 known

   the happenings of the previous night
 seemed like some fantastic nightmare
 visited on the entire populace but there
 in the harbor stood the wrecked body of
 liberty as a grim reminder of the reality
 of things and above so high as to be just
 visible rested that green agent of de-
 struction

 descended straight as a falling stone it
 fell toward the heart of the city checked
 its-rush just over the tops of the sky-
 scrapers then floated down to rest in the
 center of times square

  in appearance the object was a wonder-
fully smooth green sphere about a hundred
and fifty feet in diameter with no appar-
ent opening of any kind

  for an hour it rested there motionless
while the crowds gathered and the traffic
of the city became paralyzed squad after
squad of police arrived to form a circle
around the sphere four machine gun crews
hastily set up their weapons to command
it from any point and still nothing hap-
pened

  one officer bolder or more foolhardy
than the rest slowly approached the bulky
object foot by foot he cut down the in-
tervening distance until he stood only an
arms length away

  he reached out a hand touched it gin-
gerly and hastily backed away several
steps gaining courage he approached again
and drummed lustily on the smooth sur-
face with his club

  the sphere gave out a hollow metallic
ring that was all again he reached out
a hand to touch the hammered surface
and as his fingers met it he promptly
turned a back somersault

  the bewildered expression on his face
as he scrambled to his feet would have
been ludicrous at any other time now it
was anything but funny to the watching
crowds

  its charged he yelled electricity
my arm is numb

  a sharp clang came from the interior
of the sphere as a small section slid away
leaving an opening framing a hideous face
when viewed from earthly standards an-
other clang and another section opened
leaving a space large enough for the crea-
tures body to emerge

  short of stature and powerful of
physique with that ugly head surmount-
ing the body the stranger was far from
prepossessing in appearance

  he beckoned to the stunned officer and

that person as if hypnotized drew toward
him with lagging feet

  the strange one uttered several guttural
sounds and raised his brows as if in ques-
tion the officer shook his head the other
whipped out a pad and stylus scratched
rapidly and handed the result to the officer
again the latter shook his head

  impatiently the stranger beckoned him
closer and reaching out placed a huge
powerful hand over the officers temples
while he gazed steadily into his eyes the
policeman gave a yelp of astonishment and
turned to his fellow officers

  he says he wants to see the commander
of this planet he gasped

  commander of the planet there isnt
any

  the officer looked helplessly at the
stranger at a loss to know how to convey
the information the other solved his prob-
lem by placing one of the officers hands
over each of his own temples and again
looking him in the eyes

  the officer was intelligent weird as it
seemed he realized that the other had
the power to communicate by telepathy

  he gazed back steadily at his questioner
and concentrated on the words of his an-
swer the stranger showed surprise and
raised his hands again

  he wants the ruler of the country
then announced the officer

  hell have to go to washington

  the last answer being relayed the
stranger showed signs of impatience again

  he says he wants to see someone in
authority

  the police commissioner stepped for-
ward

   ill talk to him he answered

  for half an hour the commissioner and
the strange visitor carried on a silent con-
versation suddenly the stranger raised his
hand with an unmistakable gesture of
finality and turning about stepped back
into his sphere

  a moment he stood there then the sec-
tion clanged back into place and the globe
lifted as if in a trance the commissioner
stood watching his face drawn with the
the world in the balance



horror of some knowledge he had just
gained the spell broke the commissioner
spun on his heel and barked a command

  quick the machine guns dont let
him get away

 the four guns rose and spat their leaden
hail against the surface of the sphere that
terrible green ray visible even in bright
sunlight suddenly shone from a small aper-
ture near the bottom

  the gunners were doomed and they
knew it with blanched faces they stuck to
their weapons and rained bullets at the
rising craft

  the globe turned slowly the ray swing-
ing with it a flare of green struck a gun
squad and passed on machine gun crew-
all disintegrated before the eyes of the
crowd even the pavement below was badly
scarred

  in the center of the spot where the gun
crew had been were only several small
shining objects

  unmindful of his own danger the com-
missioner leaped to the spot and fell on
his knees

  by the eternal he muttered again
as he picked up the glittering objects
there were two gold watches one an
open-faced model was merely an empty
case the other a hunting-case type was
unharmed

  near the watches were two gold rings
the first a wedding ring the second a dia-
mond setting from which the stone had
vanished

  the commissioners voice was hoarse
with concentrated hate and horror if i
live he exclaimed i will make you pay
for the murder of these boys

  he shook his fist at the fast ascending
globe and ran for his car

a solemn-faced group of men sat
around the table in the commission-
ers office the following afternoon

  next to the commissioner was a stern-
looking naval commander in charge of
the dreadnaught in the harbor beside the
commander sat a small elderly man the
countrys greatest astronomer

  across from the latter drumming his
fingers nervously on the polished table top
was a younger man his keen eyes darting
from one to another of the group he was
a scientist one of those men to whom civi-
lization owes its greatest progress

  a major commanding the available land
forces completed the group

  the fleet was away but steaming at full
speed for new york the military forces
of the nation were being entrained from
all points toward the city but it was all
useless and those around the table knew
it

  tell us commissioner-the major
tugged at his mustache thoughtfully-tell
us please just what passed in that mental
conversation

  we have three days the commission-
ers voice was dull with the agony of
despair he gave us three days to sur-
render the entire country saturday he
will come again to times square and we
must meet him and tell him our decision

  what can we do how can we fight
such an enemy that devilish globe will
simply hang up there out of range loose
that ray and wipe us out it can conquer
the world its commander knows it we
know it and yet-to give up without a
blow-

  you major and you commander you
are the professional fighting men what
do you say

  the major met the glance of the com-
mander and both winced they knew their
limitations yet each was prepared to take
up the hopeless fight the major spoke

  we hold the fate of the world in our
hands gentlemen it is not america alone
it is the world washington has instructed
us to hold out as best we can until other
forces arrive but washington does not
know- one must have been here to realize
the terror of the thing

  heaven knows how many warriors that
globe carries what other weapons it con-
ceals it must be prevented from landing
here but how commissioner-a sudden
thought seemed to strike the major-did
you find out where it came from


famous fantastic mysteries

  i asked t e stranger answered with
some name that was meaningless to me
but into my mind flashed a picture of a
globe whirling in space while around it
spun an outer ring like this the com-
missioner grasped a pencil and sketched
his thought

  the astronomer reached over and pulled
the sheet toward him

  a globe-an outer ring it must be
saturn but we always supposed that it
was unlivable for humans

  we have the proof here now
what a chance the astronomer was
thinking aloud what a chance if we
could but capture the thing with its crew
alive the things they could tell- his
eyes were dreamy his mind far away
wandering through the solar system the
scientist always seeking knowledge

  no it was the naval commander who
spoke we cannot risk it destroy the
thing we must bend all our efforts to that
result we cannot must not risk the chance
of its escape we must destroy it now
yes- the scientist nodded destroy
it i can quite understand the professors
feeling if we merely succeed in driving
it away what then it would return to
its planet and bring others next time be-
yond a doubt the craft is experimental in
its nature if it returns others will fol-
low if it is destroyed the others will not
come because of its supposed failure it
may be years before another attempt will
be made and in that time we will have
been able to prepare for such a possibility
the question is how are we to destroy
this present menace

  mine the square the major offered
the suggestion with almost an air of
apology mine the whole of times square
and when it lands-

  no the scientist shook his head
they will be wary they have an in-
telligence of a higher degree than ours
it may hurt to admit it but we must deal
with facts they will not blunder into a
trap what can you offer commander
the commander shook his head

  i can only stand to my guns he an-

swered snapping his jaws together it is
hopeless but i cannot surrender when it
comes  shall open fire with the ships
anti-aircraft guns-and pray

  you commissioner the scientist had
quite easily assumed command what do
you propose

  the commissioner opened his lips to
speak and shook his head

  i tried before he almost whispered
and you know the result

  then listen to me the scientist leaned
forward his eyes snapping his words
crackling through the room like electric
sparks you have all admitted your in-
ability to contend with the enemy guns
ships men everything is useless every-
thing withers before that baleful ray ex-
cept one thing-and there lies our defense
and our weapon

  he leaned over and picked up the watch
cases and rings that the commissioner had
brought from the scene of the tragedy of
the previous day

  are you mad several bits of damaged
jewelry to fight with the major glared
accusingly at the scientist you cannot
be making sport at such a time

  no here the scientist leaned for-
ward again see this case it was open
faced and the ray destroyed the works
this other watch has a hunting case and
it is unharmed the ray does not consume
gold nor material that is protected by a
gold covering listen and then tell me
if i am mad

half an hour later the five men sat
leaning back in their chairs eyes
that had been dull with the knowtedge of
defeat were now bright with the hope of
victory

  hurry the scientist turned to the
commissioner you have the men trained
for the work send them out tell them
to bring every metalsmith they can find
even if they have to carry them take
over the jewelers factories they have the
machinery and the tools gather gold
gold gold-from anywhere and every-
where do not stop to bargain confiscate
the world in the balance



in the name of the government you have
force if the need comes use it and in
the museum you will find models-get
them

  all that night through all of thursday
and all of friday the jewelers shops
hummed with activity near midnight of
friday the whine of machinery began to
decrease by two oclock saturday morning
the last shop became dark and silent

  trucks sped to police headquarters
carrying the handiwork of the metal-
smiths twenty-five shining suits of armor
of pure beaten gold twenty-five ridiculous
little round gold shields their face burn-
ished so that they shone and sparkled
with each little bit of light that touched
them

  the scientist viewed the collection

  it is all we can do he turned to the
commissioner camouflage the suits with
black paint there is no need to show our
enemy the nature of our defense pick
me twenty-four men who arent afraid to
die and send them to me i am going to
wear one suit myself

  twenty-three the commissioner re-
plied quietly i need pick only twenty-
three one suit is for me i am thinking
of those dead gunners of mine

  as you will the scientist nodded if
we fail it will not matter much which of
us are among the living and which are
dead

saturday dawned clear with the
whole populace watching the sky
news was abroad the green globe had
been seen in europe asia all over the
world and at each place of call it had left
the same trail of destruction and the same
ultimatum three days to surrender

  this was to be the day of americas
answer-and the whole world was watch-
ing waiting for the news that would mean
victory and safety or defeat and chaos

  at ten oclock the globe appeared look-
ing no bigger than a marble when first
sighted down it drifted until it hung fairly
low over the harbor less than two miles
up

  from the ground a flock of airplanes
sprang to swiftly form into battle forma-
tion and speed toward the enemy

  the air battle was soon over the ma-
chine guns on the planes had hardly be-
come warm before the green ray appeared
at first only one then as the planes drew
nearer the whole globe fairly bristled with
rays darting here and there in every di-
rection

  before that deadly barrage of light the
planes disappeared one after another they
dropped from existence until but a scant
half dozen were left these last turned
and streaked back toward the landing field
beaten

  behind them the rays lengthened and
sped to catch up with them there were
four-two-one the lone survivor circled
dipped and straightened out for the land-
ing but the wheels never touched the
ground less than a hundred feet up it
became-nothing

  a series of heavy reports from the har-
bor marked the entry into the fray of the
anti-aircraft guns on the dreadnaught the
globe shot straight up so swiftly that the
watchers necks all jerked back in unison
in an attempt to follow that flight safely
out of range the globe floated quietly
again

  a bundle of green threads grew down
toward the dreadnaught standing on the
bridge the commander saw and knew his
fate

  cease firing overboard every man
jack that can get over-go

  the order was passed along and the
surface of the harbor became dotted with
bobbing heads

  alone on the bridge the commander
gripped the rail until the knuckles of his
hands stood out white his upturned eyes
followed the approach of the rays the
enemy was slow maliciously letting the
victims taste the full dregs of death at
last they struck

  the huge dreadnaught melted from
sight instantly a rushing whirling mael-
strom grew on the spot as the surrounding
waves rushed in to fill up the gap left by


famous fantastic mysteries

the disintegrating waters and the com-
mander had gone down with his ship

  in a side street off times square twenty-
five heavily moving men stirred uneasily
the golden armor bore down on them and
the strain of waiting was beginning to wear
on taut nerves

  fortunately for their peace of mind
they had been unable to see the drama
that had been enacted in and over the
harbor but they had no illusions concern-
ing their own part that was yet to be
played they knew that it would be either
victory or death

  the globe descended again circled the
city and stopped high up over the square

  scatter the scientist gave his gold-
muffled order circle the square and come
out when you hear the siren you know
your stations you know what you have to
do remember on our success or failure
hangs the fate of the nation and it may
well be the fate of the world

  he spoke to the men within the gold-
armored truck that carried the huge siren

  watch me and when i raise my arm
sound the signal

  the globe dropped slowly warily
suspecting a possible trap a volley of rays
reached down to the square and its en-
virons

  the pavement in the center of the square
vanished leaving a huge shallow crater
the scientist was right it would have
been useless to mine the square the tall
proud structure of the times building dis-
appeared the paramount and others fol-
lowed one by one until in the center of
new york there was a huge circle of bar-
renness with only a light green haze drift-
ing across the space where times square
had been

  nearer dropped the globe and again
it stopped barely a hundred feet up

  the scientist raised his arm the huge
siren screeched out its signal the sound
echoing back and forth from the walls
of the buildings yet standing

  the men of the gold armor appeared
walking slowly heavily over the edge of
the crater each swinging his burnished
shield slowly they drew toward each other
until they had formed a rough circle about
three hundred feet across

  the globe hung quietly then as if in
question a slim green ray crept down and
touched one of the armored men as by
magic the black paint covering the armor
disappeared leaving a brilliant golden
figure standing out in the full afternoon
light

  the globe shot up a few hundred feet
hesitated then drifted down to its former
level twenty-five rays gleamed out from
its polished surface the entire band of
armored men suddenly shone as had the
first

  the scientist waved his arm and swung
his shield before him the others followed
suit again following his lead they all
faced their shields upward those green
rays impotently playing over the golden
figures were caught on the polished sur-
faces of the shields a moment of waver-
ing and then the reflected rays shot back
toward their projector too late the com-
mander of that weird craft must have
realized the meaning of those shields-
golden mirrors each sending back at him
the terrible ray of death that was his own
weapon

  like a toy balloon drawn over a gas
flame the globe itself disintegrated a ball
of greenish mist hung motionless over-
head-then only the clear blue of the sky
could be seen

  in the center of the square two golden
figures clasped each other clumsily and
attempted to shake hands

  thank heaven weve won the
scientist jerked up his gold visor and
peered at the commissioner

  yes the commissioners reply was
blurred by a choking sob america-the
world-is safe and those dead heroes-
they will rest happily nowl

south polar gold

when the news came of the dis-
covery of gold at the south pole
in  nobody suspected that
the beginning had been reached of a new
era in the worlds history the newsboys
cried extra as they had done a thou-
sand times for murders battles fires and
wall street panics but nobody was ex-
cited in fact the reports at first seemed
so exaggerated and improbable that hardly
anybody believed a word of them who
could have been expected to credit a
despatch forwarded by cable from new
zealand and signed by an unknown
name which contained such a statement
as this

  a seam of gold which can be cut with
a knife has been found within ten miles
of the south pole

  in a little while several additional re-
ports came some via new zealand others
via south america and all confirming in
every respect what had been sent before
then a new york newspaper sent a swift
steamer to the antarctic and when this
enterprising journal published a four-page
cable describing the discoveries in detail
all doubt vanished and the rush began

  for many years silver had been absent
from the coinage of the world its increas-
ing abundance rendered it unsuitable for
money especially when contrasted with
gold

  the common monetary system prevail-
ing in every land fostered trade and facili-
tated the exchange of products travelers
never had to bother their heads about the
currency of money any coin that passed

reprinted from the may  all-story magazine

in new york would pass for its face value
in london paris berlin rome madrid
or in leningrad constantinople cairo
khartoum jerusalem peking or yeddo
it was indeed the golden age and the
world had never been so free from finan-
cial storms

upon this peaceful scene the south
polar gold discoveries burst like an
unheralded tempest

  i happened to be in the company of a
famous bank president when the confirma-
tion of those discoveries suddenly filled
the streets with yelling newsboys

  get me one of those extras he said
and an office-boy ran out to obey him as
he perused the sheet his face darkened

  im afraid its too true he said at
length yes there seems to be no getting
around it gold is going to be as plentiful
as iron if there were not such a flood
of it we might manage but when they
begin to make trousers buttons out of the
same metal that is now locked and guarded
in steel vaults where will be our standard
of worth my dear fellow he continued
impulsively laying his hand on my arm
i would as willingly face the end of the
world as this thats coming

  you think it so bad then i asked
but most people will not agree with you
they will regard it as very good news
how can it be good he burst out
what have we got to take the place of
gold can we go back to the age of bar-
ter can we substitute cattle-pens and
wheat-bins for the strong boxes of the
treasury can commerce exist with nc
common measure of exchange

famous fantastic mysteries

to be but too well grounded the deposits
of gold at the south pole were richer than
the wildest reports had rep esented them
the shipments of the prec ious metal to
america and europe soon became enor-
mous-so enormous that the met a was no
longer precious

  the price of gold dropped like a falling
stone with accelerated velocity and with-
in a year every money center in the world
had been swept by a panic gold was more
common than iron every government was
compelled to demonetize it for when once
gold had fallen into contempt it was less
valuable in the eyes of the public than
stamped paper for once the world had
thoroughly learned the lesson that too
much of a good thing is worse than none
of it

  then somebody found a new use for
gold by inventing a process by which it
could be hardened and tempered assum-
ing a wonderful toughness and elasticity
without losing its non-corrosive property
and in this form it rapidly took the place
of steel

  in the meantime every effort was made
to bolster up credit endless were the at-
tempts to find a substitute for gold the
chemists sought it in their laboratories
and the mineralogists in the mountains
and deserts platinum might have served
but it too had become a drug in the
market through the discovery of immense
deposits out of the twenty odd elements
which had been rarer and more valuable
than gold such as uranium gallium etc
not one was found to answer the purpose
in short it was evident that since both
gold and silver had become too abundant
to serve any longer for a money standard
the planet held no metal suitable to take
their place

  the entire monetary system of the
world must be readjusted but in the re-
adjustment it was certain to fall to pieces
in fact it had already fallen to pieces
the only recourse was to paper money but
whether this was based upon agriculture
or mining or manufacture it gave vary-
ing standards not only among the differ-

ent nations but in successive years in the
same country exports and imports prac-
tically ceased credit was discredited com-
merce perished and the world at a bound
seemed to have gone back financially and
industrially to the dark ages

  one final effort was made a great finan-
cial congress was assembled at new york
representatives of all the nations took
part in it the ablest financiers of europe
and america united the efforts of their
genius and the results of their experience
to solve the great problem the various
governments all solemnly stipulated to
abide by the decision of the congress

  but after spending months in hard but
fruitless labor that body was no nearer
the end of its undertaking than when it
first assembled the entire world awaited
its decision with bated breath and yet
the decision was not formed

  at this paralyzing crisis a most unex-
pected event suddenly opened the way

 chapter ii

 the magician of science

an attendant entered the room
where the perplexed financiers were
in session and presented a peculiar-look-
ing card to the president mr boon the 
president took the card in his hand and so
complete was his absorption that herr
finster the celebrated berlin banker who
had been addressing the chair for the last
two hours from the opposite end of the
long table got confused entirely lost track
of his verb and suddenly dropped into his
seat very red in the face and wearing a
most injured expression

  but president boon paid no attention
except to the singular card which he con-
tinued to turn over and over balancing
it on his fingers and holding it now at
arms-length and then near his nose with
one eye squinted as if he were trying to
look through a hole in the card

  at length this odd conduct of the pre-
siding officer drew all eyes upon the card
and then everybody shared the interest
of mr boon in shape and size the card
the moon metal



was not extraordinary but it was com-
posed ol metal what metai plainly it
was not tin brass copper bronze silver
aluminum-although its lightness might
have suggested that metal-nor even base
gold

  the president although a skilled metal-
lurgist confessed his inability to say what
it was so intent had he become in ex-
amining the curious bit of metal that he
forgot it was a visitors card of introduc-
tion and did not even look for the name
which it presumably bore

  as he held the card up to get a better
light upon it a stray sunbeam from the
window fell across the metal and instantly
it bloomed with exquisite colors the
presidents chair being in the darker end
of the room the radiant card suffused the
atmosphere about him with a faint rose
tint playing with surprising liveliness into
alternate canary color and violet

  the effect upon the company of clear-
headed financiers was extremely remark-
able the unknown metal appeared to ex-
ercise a kind of mesmeric influence its
soft hues blending together in a chromatic
harmony which captivated the sense of
vision as the ears are charmed by a per-
fectly rendered song gradually all gath-
ered in an eager group around the presi-
dents chair

  what can it be was repeated from
yp to lip

  did you ever see anything like it
asked mr boon for the twentieth time

  none of them had ever seen the like of
it a spell fell upon the assemblage for
five minutes no one spoke while mr boon
continued to chase the flickering sunbeam
with the wonderful card suddenly the
silence was broken by a voice which had
a touch of awe in it

  it must be the metal

  the speaker was an english financier
first lord of the treasury hon james
hampton-jones k c b immediately
everybody echoed his remark and the
strain being thus relieved the spell
dropped from them and several laughed
loudly over their momentary aberration

president boon recollected him-
self and coloring slightly placed the
card hat on the table in order more clearly
to see the name in plain red letters it
stood forth with such surprising distinct-
ness that mr boon wondered why he had
so long overlooked it

         dr max syx

  tell the gentleman to come in said
the president and thereupon the attendant
threw open the door

  the owner of the mysterious card fixed
every eye as he entered he was several
inches more than six feet in height his
complexion was very dark his eyes were
intensely black bright and deep-set his
eyebrows were bushy and up-curled at the
ends his sable hair was close-trimmed
and his ears were narrow pointed at the
top and prominent he wore black mus-
taches covering only half the width of his
lip and drawn into projecting needles on
each side while a spiked black beard
adorned the middle of his chin

  he smiled as he stepped confidently
forward with a courtly bow but it was
a very disconcerting smile because it more
than half resembled a sneer this uncom-
mon person did not wait to be addressed

  i have come to solve your problem
he said facing president boon who had
swung round on his pivoted chair

  the metal exclaimed everybody in
a breath and with a unanimity and ex-
citement which would have astonished
them if they had been spectators instead
of actors of the scene the tall stranger
bowed and smiled again

  just so he said what do you think
of it

  it is beautiful

  the mesmeric spell seemed once more
to fall upon the assemblage for the finan-
ciers noticed nothing remarkable in the
next act of the stranger which was to
take a chair uninvited at the table and
the moment he sat down he became the


famous fantastic mysteries

presiding officer as naturally as if he had
just been elected to the post they all
waited for him to speak and when he
opened his mouth they listened with
breathless attention

  his words were of the best english
but there was some peculiarity which
they had already noticed either in his
voice or his manner of enunciation which
struck all of the listeners as denoting a
foreigner but none of them could satis-
factorily place him neither the ameri-
cans the englishmen the germans the
frenchmen the russians the austrians
the italians the spaniards the turks the
japanese or the chinese at the board
could decide to what race he belonged

  this metal he began i have dis-
covered and named i call it artemisium

i	can produce it in the pure form abun-
dantly enough to replace gold giving it
the same relative value that gold possessed
when it was the universal standard

  as dr syx spoke he snapped the card
with his thumb-nail and it fluttered with
quivering hues like a humming-bird hover-
ing over a flower he seemed to await a
reply and president boon asked

  what guarantee can you give that the
supply would be adequate and continu-
ous

  i will conduct a committee of this
congress to my mine in the rocky moun-
tains where in anticipation of the event

i	have accumulated enough refined ar-
temisium to provide every civilized land
with an amount of coin equivalent to that
which is formerly held in gold i can there
satisfy you of my ablity to maintain the
production

  but how do we know that this metal
of yours will answer the purpose

  try it was the laconic reply

  there is another difficulty pursued
the president people will not accept a
new metal in place of gold unless they are
convinced that it possesses equal intrinsic
value they must first become familiar
with it and it must be abundant enough
and desirable enough to be used sparingly
in the arts just as gold was

  i have provided for all that said the
stranger with one of his disconcerting
smiles i assure you that there will be no
trouble with the people they will be only
too eager to get and to use the metal let
me show you

  he stepped to the door and immedi-
ately returned with two black attendants
bearing a large tray filled with articles
shaped from the same metal as that of
which the card was composed the finan-
ciers all jumped to their feet with ex-
clamations of surprise and admiration
and gathered around the tray whose daz-
zling contents lighted up the corner of the
room where it had been placed as if the
moon were shining there

  there were elegantly formed vases
adorned with artistic figures embossed
and incised and glowing with delicate
colors which shimmered in tiny waves with
the slightest motion of the tray cups
pins finger-rings earrings watch-chains
combs studs lockets medals tableware
models of coins-in brief almost every ar-
ticle in the fabrication of which precious
metals have been employed was to be
seen there in profusion and all composed
of the strange new metal which every-
body on the spot declared was far more
splendid than gold

  do you think it will answer asked
dr syx

  we do was the unanimous reply

all then resumed their seats at the
table the tray with its magnificent
array having been placed in the center
of the board this display had a remark-
able influence confidence awoke in the
breasts of the financiers the dark clouds
that had oppressed them rolled off and
the prospect grew decidedly brighter

  what terms do you demand at
length asked mr boon cheerfully rub-
bing his hands

  i must have military protection for
my mine and reducing works replied
dr syx then i shall ask the return of
one per cent on the circulating medium
together with the privilege of disposing
the moon metal



of a certain amount of the metal-to be
limited by agreement-to the public for
use in the arts of the proceeds of this
sale i will pay ten per cent to the gov-
ernment in consideration of its protec-
tion

  but exclaimed president boon that
will make you the richest man who ever
lived

  undoubtedly was the reply

  why added mr boon opening his
eyes wider as the facts continued to dawn
upon him you will become the financial
dictator of the whole earth

  undoubtedly again responded dr
syx unmoved that is what i purpose
to become my discovery entitles me to
no less but remember i place myself
under government inspection and restric-
tion i should not be allowed to flood the
market even if i were disposed to do so
but my own interest would restrain me
it is to my advantage that artemisium
once adopted shall remain stable in
value

  a shadow of doubt suddenly crossed
the presidents face

  suppose your secret is discovered he
said surely your mine will not remain
the only one if you in so short a time
have been able to accumulate an immense
quantity of the new metal it must be
extremely abundant others will discover
it and then where shall we be

  while mr boon uttered these words
those who were watching dr syx as the
president was not resembled persons
whose startled eyes are fixed upon a wild
beast preparing to spring as mr boon
ceased speaking he turned toward the
visitor and instantly his lips fell apart
and his face paled

  dr syx had drawn himself up to his
full stature and his features were dis-
torted with that peculiar mocking smile
which had now returned with a concen-
trated expression of mingled self-con-
fidence and disdain

  will you have relief or not he asked
in a dry hard voice what can you do

i alone possess the secret which can re-

store industry and commerce if you re-
ject my offer do you think a second one
will come

  president boon found voice to reply
stammeringly

  i did not mean to suggest a rejection
of the offer i only wished to inquire if
you thought it probable that there would
be no repetition of what occurred after
gold was found at the south pole

  the earth may be full of my metal
returned dr syx almost fiercely but
so long as i alone possess the knowledge
how to extract it is it of any more worth
than common dirt but come he added
after a pause and softening his manner
i have other schemes willyou as repre-
sentatives of the leading nations under-
take the introduction of artemisium as a
substitute for gold or will you not

  can we not have time for delibera-
tion asked president boon

  yes one hour within that time i
shall return to learn your decision re-
plied dr syx rising and preparing to
depart i leave these things-pointing
to the tray-in your keeping and-
significantly-i trust your decision will
be a wise one

  his curious smile again curved his lips
and shot the ends of his mustache up-
ward and the influence of that smile re-
mained in the room when he had closed
the door behind him the financiers gazed
at one another for several minutes in
silence then they turned toward the corus-
cating metal that filled the tray

the grand teton mine

away on the western border of
wyoming in the all but inaccessible
heart of the rocky mountains three
mighty brothers the big tetons look
perpendicularly into the blue eye of
jennys lake lying at the bottom of the
profound depression among the mountains
called jacksons hole bracing against one
another for support these remarkable
peaks lift their granite spires nearly four-


famous fantastic mysteries

teen thousand feet into the blue dome that
arches the crest of the continent their
sides and especially those of their chief
the grand teton are streaked with
glaciers which shine like silver trappings
when the morning sun comes up above
the wilderness of mountains stretching
away eastward from the hole

  when the first white men penetrated
this wonderful region and one of them
bestowed his wifes name upon jennys
lake they were intimidated by the grand
teton it made their flesh creep accus-
tomed though they were to rough scram-
bling among mountain gorges and on the
brows of immense precipices when they
glanced up the face of the peak where
the cliffs fall one below another in a
series of breathless descents and imagined
themselves clinging for dear life to those
skyey battlements

  but when in  messrs stevenson
and langford finally reached the top of
the grand teton-the only successful
members of a party of nine practised
climbers who had started together from
the bottom-they found there a little
rectangular inclosure made by piling up
rocks six or seven feet across and three
feet in height bearing evidences of great
age and indicating that the red indians
had for some unknown purpose resorted
to the summit of this tremendous peak
long before the white men invaded their
mountains yet neither the indians nor the
whites ever really conquered the teton
for above the highest point that they at-
tained rises a granite buttress whose
smooth vertical sides seemed to them to
defy everything but wings

  on a july morning about a month after
the visit of dr max syx to the assembled
financiers in new york a party of twenty
horsemen following a mountain trail ar-
rived on the eastern margin of jacksons
hole and pausing upon a commanding
eminence with exclamations of wonder
glanced across the great depression where
lay the shining coils of the snake river
at the towering forms of the tetons whose
ice-striped cliffs flashed lightnings in the

sunshine curling above one of the wild
gorges that cut the lower slopes of the
tetons was a thick black smoke which
when lifted by a passing breeze obscured
the precipices half-way to the summit of
the peak

  had the grand teton become a vol-
cano certainly no hunting or exploring
party could make a smoke like that but
a word from the leader of the party of
horsemen explained the mystery

  there is my mill and the mine is un-
derneath it

  the speaker was dr syx and his com-
panions were members of the financial
congress when he quitted their presence
in new york with the promise to return
within an hour for their reply he had no
doubt in his own mind what that reply
would be he knew they would accept
his proposition and they did no time was
then lost in communicating with the vari-
ous governments and arrangements were
quickly perfected whereby in case the in-
spection of dr syxs mine and its re-
sources proved satisfactory america and
europe should unite in adopting the new
metal as the basis of their coinage as
soon as this stage in the negotiations was
reached it only remained to send a com-
mittee of financiers and metallurgists in
company with dr syx to the rocky
mountains

  an inspection of the records at wash-
ington dr syx continued addressing
the horsemen will show that i have filed
a claim covering ten acres of ground
around the mouth of my mine this was
done as soon as i had discovered the metal
the filing of the claim and the subsequent
proceedings which perfected my ownership
attracted no attention because everybody
was thinking of the south pole and its
gold-fields

the party gathered closer around dr
syx and listened to his words with
silent attention while their horses rubbed
noses and jingled their gold-mounted trap-
pings

  as soon as i had legally protected my-
the moon metal



self he continued i employed a force
of men transported my machinery and
material across the mountains erected my
furnaces and opened the mine i was safe
from intrusion and even from idle curi-
osity for the reason i have just men-
tioned in fact so exclusive was the at-
traction of the new gold-fields that i had
difficulty in obtaining workmen and fi-
nally i sent to africa and engaged negroes
whom i placed in charge of trustworthy
foremen

  and with their aid you have mined
enough metal to supply the mints of the
world asked president boon

  exactly so was the reply but i no
longer employ the large force which i
needed at first

  i shall show you to-day said dr
syx with his curious smile twenty-five
thousand tons of refined artemisium
stacked in rock-cut vaults under the grand
teton

  and you have dared to collect such
inconceivable wealth in one place

  you forget that it is not wealth until
the people have learned to value it and
the governments have put their stamp
upon it

  the party did not wait for further ex-
planations they were eager to see the
wonderful mine and the store of treasure
spurs were applied and they galloped
down the steep trail forded the snake
river and skirting the shore of jennys
lake soon found themselves gazing up
the headlong slopes and dizzy parapets of
the grand teton dr syx led them by a
steep ascent to the mouth of the canyon
above one of whose walls stood his mill
and where the champ champ of a
powerful engine saluted their ears

chapter iv

the wealth of the world

an electric light shot its pene-
trating rays into a gallery cut
through virgin rock and running straight
toward the heart of the teton the cen-
ter of the gallery was occupied by a nar-

row railway on which a few flat cars pro
pelled by electric power passed to and
fro black-skinned and silent workmen
rode on the cars both when they came
laden wth broken masses of rock from the
farther end of the tunnel and when they
returned empty

  suddenly to an eye situated a little
wav within the gallery appeared at the
entrance the dark face of dr syx wear-
ing its most discomposing smile and a
moment later the broader countenance of
president boon loomed in the electric glare
beside the doctors black framework of
eyebrows and mustache behind them were
groujed the other visiting financiers

  this tunnel said dr syx leads to
the mine head where the ore-bearing
rock is blasted

  as he spoke a hollow roar issued from
the depths of the mountain followed in a
short time by a gust of foul air

  you probably will not care to go in
there said the doctor and in fact it is
very uncomfortable but we shall follow
the next car-load to the smelter and you
can witness the reduction of the ore

  accordingly when another car came
rumbling out of the tunnel with its load
of cracked rock they all accompanied it
into an adjoining apartment where it was
cast into a metallic shute through which
they were informed it reached the fur-
nace

  while it is melting explained dr
syx certain elements the nature of which
i must beg to keep secret are mixed with
the ore causing chemical action which re-
sults in the extraction of the metal now
let me show you pure artemisium issuing
from the furnace

  he led the visitors through two apart-
ments into a third one side of which was
walled by the front of a furnace from
this projected two or three small spouts
and iridescent streams of molten metal
fell from the spouts into earthen recep-
tacles from which the blazing liquid was
led like flowing iron into a system of
molds where it was allowed to cool and
harden


famous fantastic mysteries

  the financiers looked on wonderingly
and their astonishment grew when they
were conducted into the rock-cut store-
rooms beneath where they saw metallic
ingots glowing like gigantic opals in the
light which dr syx turned on they were
piled in rows along the walls as high as
a man could reach a very brief inspection
sufficed to convince the visitors that dr
syx was able to perform all that he prom-
ised although they had not penetrated
the secret of his process of reducing the
ore yet they had seen the metal flowing
from the furnace and the piles of ingots
proved conclusively that he had uttered
no vain boast when he said he could give
the world a new coinage

  but president boon being himself a
metallurgist desired to inspect the mys-
terious ore a little more closely possibly
he was thinking that if another mine was
destined to be discovered he might as well
be the discoverer as anybody dr syx at-
tempted no concealment but his smile be-
came more than usually scornful as he
stopped a laden car and invited the visitors
to help themselves

  i think he said that i have struck
the only lode of this ore in the teton or
possibly in this part of the world but i
dont know for certain there may be
plenty of it only waiting to be found
that however doesnt trouble me the
great point is that nobody except myself
knows how to extract the metal

  mr boon closely examined the chunk
of rock which he had taken from the car
then he pulled a lens from his pocket
with a deprecatory glance at dr syx

  oh thats all right said the latter
with a laugh the first that these gentle-
men had ever heard from his lips and it
almost made them shudder put it to
every test examine it with the microscope
with fire with electricity with the spec-
troscope-in every way you can think ofl
i assure you it is worth your while

  again dr syx uttered his freezing
laugh passing into the familiar smile
which had now become an undisguised
mock

  upon my word said mr boon tak-
ing his eye from the lens i see no sign
of any metal here

  look at the green specks cried the
doctor snatching the specimen from the
presidents hand thats it thats ar-
temisium but its of no use unless you
can get it out and purify it which is my
secret

  for the third time dr syx laughed
and his merriment affected the visitors so
disagreeably that they showed impatience
to be gone immediately he changed his
manner

  come into my office he said with a
return to the graciousness which had char-
acterized him ever since the party started
from new york

when they were all seated and the
doctor had handed round a box of
cigars he resumed the conversation in his
most amiable manner

  you see gentlemen he said turn-
ing a piece of ore in his fingers arte-
misium is like aluminum it can only be
obtained in the metallic form by a specal
process while these greenish particles
which you may perhaps mistake for chry-
solite or some similar unisilicate really
contain the precious metal they are not
entirely composed of it the process by
which i separate out the metallic element
while the ore is passing through the fur-
nace is in truth quite simple and its
very simplicity guards my secret make
your minds easy as to over-production a
man is as likely to jump over the moon
as to find me out

  but he continued again changing his
manner we have had business enough
for one day now for a little recreation
while speaking the doctor pressed a
button on his desk and the room which
was illuminated by electric lamps-for
there were no windows in the building-
became dark except part of one wall
where a broad area of light appeared

  dr syxs voice had become very sooth-
ing when next he spoke

  i am fond of amusing myself with a
the moon metal



peculiar form of motion picture projec-
tor which i invented some years ago
and which i have never exhibited except
for the entertainment of my friends

  he had hardly ceased speaking when
the illuminated space seemed to melt
away leaving a great opening through
which the spectators looked as if into an-
other world on the opposite side of the
wall for a minute or two they could not
clearly discern what was presented then
gradually the flitting scenes and figures
became more distinct until the lifelikeness
of the spectacle absorbed their whole at-
tention

  before them passed in panoramic re-
view a sunny land filled with brilliant-
hued vegetation and dotted with villages
and cities which were bright with light-
colored buildings people appeared mov-
ing through the scenes as in a movie show
but with infinitely more semblance of
reality in fact the pictures blending one
into another seemed to be life itself yet
it was not an earth-like scene the colors
of the passing landscape were such as
no man in the room had ever beheld and
the people tall round-limbed with florid
complexion golden hair and brilliant eyes
and lips were indescribably beautiful and
graceful in all their movements

from the land the view passed out to
sea and bright blue waves edged
with creaming foam ran swiftly under the
spectators eyes and occasionally driven
before light winds appeared fleets of
daintily shaped vessels which reminded
the beholder by their flashing wings of
the feigned ship of pearl

  after the fairy ships and breezy sea
views came a long curving line of coast
brilliant with coral sands and indented by
frequent bays along whose enchanting
shore lay pleasant towns the landscapes
behind them splendid with groves
meadows and streams

  presently the shifting photographic
film or whatever the mechanism may have
been appeared to have settled upon a
chosen scene and there it rested a broad

champaign reached away to distant
sapphire mountains while the foreground
was occupied by a magnificent house re-
sembling a large country villa fronted
with a garden shaded by bowers and fes-
toons of huge brilliant flowers birds of
radiant plumage flitted among the trees
and blossoms and then appeared a com-
pany of gayly attired people including
many young girls who joined hands and
danced in a ring apparently with shouts of
laughter while a group of musicians
standing near thrummed and blew upon
curiously shaped instruments

  suddenly the shadow of a dense cloud
flitted across the scene whereupon the
brilliant birds flew away with screams of
terror an expression of horror came over
the faces of the people the children broke
from their merry circle and ran for pro-
tection to their elders the utmost con-
fusing and whelming terror were evinced
for a moment-then the ground split
asunder and the house and the garden
with all their living occupants were swal-
lowed by an awful chasm which opened
just where they had stood the great rent
ran in a widening line across the sunlit
landscape until it reached the horizon
when the distant mountains crumbled
clouds poured in from all sides at once
and billows of flame burst through them
as they veiled the scene

  but in another instant the commotion
was over and the world whose curious
spectacles had been enacted as if on the
other side of a window seemed to retreat
swiftly into space until at last emerg-
ing from a fleecy cloud it reappeared in
the form of the full moon hanging in the
sky but larger than is its wont with its
dry ocean-beds its keen-spired peaks its
ragged mountain ranges its gaping chasms
its immense crater rings and tycho the
chief of them all shooting ray-like streaks
across the scarred face of the abandoned
lunar globe

  the showr was ended and dr syx turn-
ing on only a partial illumination in the
room rose slowly to his feet his tall form
appearing strangely magnified in the


famous fantastic mysteries

gloom and invited his bewildered guests
to accompany him to his house outside
the mill where he said dinner awaited
them as they emerged into daylight they
acted like persons just aroused from an
opiate dream

chapter v

wonders of the new metal

within a twelvemonth after the
visit of president boon and his fel-
low-financiers to the mine in the grand
teton a railway had been constructed
from jacksons hole connecting with one
of the pacific lines and the distribution
of the new metal was begun all of dr
syxs terms had been accepted united
states troops occupied a permanent en-
campment on the upper waters of the
snake river to afford protection and as
the consignments of precious ingots were
hurried east and west on guarded trains
the mints all over the world resumed their
activity once more a common monetary
standard prevailed and commerce revived
as if touched by a magic wand

  artemisium quickly won its way in
popular favor its matchless beauty alone
was enough not only was it gladly ac-
cepted in the form of money but its suc-
cess was instantaneous in the arts dr
syx and the inspectors representing the
various nations found it difficult to limit
the output to the agreed-upon amount
the demand was incessant

  goldsmiths and jewelers continually
discovered new excellences in the wonder-
ful metal its properties of translucence
and refraction enabled skilful artists to
perform marvels by suitable management
a chain of artemisium could be made to
resemble a string of vari-colored gems
each separate link having a tint of its
own while as the wearer moved delicate
complementary colors chased one another
in rapid undulation from end to end

  a fresh charm was added by the new
metal to the personal adornment of
women and an enhanced splendor to the
pageants of society gold in its palmiest

days had never enjoyed such a vogue a
crowded reception-room or a dinner-party
where artemisium abounded possessed an
indescribable atmosphere of luxury and
richness refined in quality yet captivat-
ing to every sense imaginative persons
went so far as to aver that the sight and
presence of the metal exercised a strangely
soothing and dreamy power over the mind
like the influence of moonlight streaming
through the tree-tops on a still balmy
night

  the public curiosity in regard to the
origin of artemisium was boundless the
various nations published official bulletins
in which the general facts omitting of
course such incidents as the singular ex-
hibition seen by the visiting financiers on
the wall of dr syxs office-were detailed
to gratify the universal desire for in-
formation

  president boon not only submitted
the specimens of ore-bearing rock which
he had brought from the mine to care-
ful analysis but also appealed to several
of the greatest living chemists and min-
eralogists to aid him but they were
all equally mystified the green sub-
stance contained in the ore although
differing slightly from ordinary chrys-
olite answered all the known tests of
that mineral it was remembered how-
ever that dr syx had said that they
would be likely to mistake the substance
for chrysolite and the result of their
experiments justified his prediction evi-
dently the doctor had gone a stones-
cast beyond the chemistry of the day
and just as evidently he did not mean
to reveal his discovery for the benefit of
science nor for the benefit of any pockets
except his own

  notwithstanding the failure of the chem-
ists to extract anything from dr syxs
ore the public at large never doubted that
the secret would be discovered in good
time and thousands of prospectors flocked
to the teton mountains in search of the
ore and without much difficulty they
found it evidently the doctor had been
mistaken in thinking that his mine might
the moon metal



be the only one the new miners hurried
specimens of the green-speckled rock to the
chemical laboratories for experimentation
and meanwhile began to lay up stores of
the ore in anticipation of the time when
the proper way to extract the metal should
be discovered

  but alas that time did not come the
fresh ore proved to be as refractory as that
which had been obtained from dr syx
but in the midst of the universal disap-
pointment there came a new sensation

one morning the newspapers glared
with a despatch from grand teton
station announcing that the metal itself
had been discovered by prospectors on the
eastern slope of the main peak

  it outcrops in many places ran the
despatch and many small nuggets have
been picked out of crevices in the rocks

  the excitement produced by this news
was even greater than when gold was dis-
covered at the south pole again a mad
rush was made for the tetons the heights
around jacksons hole and the shores of
jacksons and jennys lakes were quickly
dotted with camps and the military force
had to be doubled to keep off the curious
and occasionally menacing crowds which
gathered in the vicinity and seemed bent
on unearthing the great secret locked be-
hind the windowless walls of the mill
there the column of black smoke and the
roar of the engine served as reminders of
the incredible wealth which the sole pos-
sessor of that secret was rolling up

  this time no mistake had been made
it was a fact that the metal in virgin
purity had been discovered scattered in
various places on the ledges of the grand
teton in a little while thousands had
obtained specimens with their own hands
the quantity was distressingly small con-
sidering the number and the eagerness of
the seekers but that it was genuine arte-
misium not even dr syx could have
denied he however made no attempt to
deny it

  yes he said when questioned i find
that i have been deceived at first i

thought the metal existed only in the form
of the green ore but of late i have come
upon veins of pure artemisium in my mine
i am glad for your sakes but sorry for
my own still it may turn out that there
is no great amount of free artemisium
after all

  while the doctor talked in this manner
close observers detected a lurking sneer
which his acquaintances had not noticed
since artemisium was first adopted as the
money basis of the world

  the crowd that swarmed upon the
mountain quickly exhausted all of the
visible supply of the metal sometimes
they found it in a thin stratum at the
bottom of crevices where it could be de-
tached in opalescent plates and leaves of
the thickness of paper these superficial
deposits evidently might have been formed
from water holding the metal in solution
occasionally deep cracks contained nug-
gets and wiry masses which looked as if
they had run together when they were
molten

  the most promising spots were soon
staked out in miners claims machinery
was procured  stock companies were
formed and borings were begun the en-
thusiasm arising from the earlier finds
and the flattering surface indications
caused everybody to work with feverish
haste and energy and within two months
one hundred tunnels were piercing the
mountain

  for a long time nobody was willing to
admit the truth which gradually forced
itself upon the attention of the miners
the deeper they went the scarcer became
the indications of artemisium in fact
such deposits as were found were confined
to fissures near the surface but dr syx
continued to report a surprising increase
in the amount of free metal in his mine
and this encouraged all who had not ex-
hausted their capital to push on their tun-
nels in the hope of finally striking a vein
at length however the smaller operators
gave up in despair until only one heavily
capitalized company still remained work-
ing

a strange discovery

tt is my belief that dr max syx is
  a a deceiver

  the person who uttered this opinion
was a young engineer andrew hall who
had charge of the operations of one of
the mining companies which were driving
tunnels into the grand teton

  what do you mean by that asked
president boon who was the principal
backer of the enterprise

  i mean replied hall that there is
no free metal in this mountain and dr
syx knows there is none

  but he is getting it himself from his
mine retorted president boon

  so he says but who has seen it no
one is admitted into the syx mine his
foremen are forbidden to talk and his
workmen are specially imported negroes
who do not understand english

  but persisted mr boon how then
do you account for the nuggets scattered
over the mountain and besides what
object could dr syx have in pretending
that there is free metal to be had for the
digging

  he may have salted the mountain
for all i know said hall as for his
object i confess i am entirely in the
dark but for all that i am convinced
that we shall find no more metal if we
dig ten miles for it

  nonsense said the president if we
keep on we shall strike did not dr syx
himself admit that he found no free ar-
temisium until his tunnel had reached
the core of the peak we must go as deep
as he has gone before we give up

  i fear the depths he attains are be-
yond most peoples reach was halls
answer while a thoughtful look crossed
his clear-cut brow but since you desire
it of course the work shall go on i shall
like however to change the direction of
the tunnel

  certainly replied mr boon bore
in whatever direction you think proper
only dont despair

about a month after this conversa-
tion andrew hall with whom a
community of tastes in many things had
made me intimately acquainted asked
me one morning to accompany him into
his tunnel

  i want to have a trusty friend at my
elbow he said for unless i am a
dreamer something remarkable will hap-
pen within the next hour and two wit-
nesses are better than one

  when we arrived at the head of the
tunnel i was surprised at finding no work-
men there

  i stopped blasting some time ago
said hall in explanation for a reason
which i hope will become evident to you
very slowly and yesterday i paid off the
men and dismissed them with the an-
nouncement which i am confident pres-
ident boon will sanction after he hears
my report of this mornings work that
the tunnel is abandoned you see i am
now using a drill which i can manage
without assistance i believe the work is
almost completed and i want you to
witness the end of it

  he then carefully applied the drill
which noiselessly screwed its nose into
the rock when it had sunk to a depth
of a few inches he withdrew it and taking
a hand-drill capable of making a hole not
more than an eighth of an inch in diameter
cautiously began boring in the center of
the larger cavity he had made hardly
a hundred turns of the handle when the
drill shot through the rock a gratified
smile illuminated his features and he said
in a suppressed voice

  dont be alarmed im going to put
out the light

  instantly we were in complete dark-
ness but being close at halls side i could
detect his movements he pulled out the
drill and for half a minute remained
motionless as if listening there was no
sound

  i must enlarge the opening he whis-
pered and immediately the faint grating
of a sharp tool cutting through the rock
informed me of his progress
the moon metal



  there at last he said i think that
will do now for a look

  i could tell that he had placed his eye
at the hole and was gazing with breath-
less attention presently he pulled my
sleeve

 put your eye here he whispered
pushing me into the proper position for
looking through the hole

  at first i could discern nothing except
a smoky blue glow but soon my vision
cleared a little and then i perceived that
i was gazing into a narrow tunnel which
met ours directly end to end glancing
along the axis of this gallery i saw some
two hundred yards away a faint light
which evidently indicated the mouth of
the tunnel

 at the end where we had met it the
mysterious tunnel was considerably
widened at one side as if the excavators
had started to change direction and then
abandoned the work and in this elbow
i could just see the outlines of two or
three flat cars loaded with broken stone
while a heap of the same material lay
near them through the center of the
tunnel ran a railway track

to you know what you are looking
  -lat asked hall in my ear

  i begin to suspect i replied that
you have accidentally run into dr syxs
mine

 if dr syx had been on his guard
this accident wouldnt have happened
replied hall with a low chuckle

  i heard you remark a month ago i
said that you were changing the direc-
tion of your tunnel has this been the
aim of your labors ever since

  you have hit it he replied long
ago i became convinced that my com-
pany was throwing away its money in a
vain attempt to strike a lode of pure
artemisium but president boon has great
faith in dr syx and would not give up
the work so i adopted what i regarded
as the only practicable method of proving
the truth of my opinion and saving the
companys funds

  an electric indicator of my invention
enabled me to locate the syx tunnel when
i got near it and i have met it end on
and opened this peephole in order to ob-
serve the doctors operations i feel that
such spying is entirely justified in the
circumstances although i cannot yet ex-
plain just how or why i feel sure that
dr syx was the cause of the sudden dis-
covery of the surface nuggets and that he
has encouraged the miners for his own
ends until he has brought ruin to thou-
sands who have spent their last cent in
driving useless tunnels into this mountain
it is a righteous thing to expose him
but i interposed i do not see that
you have exposed anything yet except
the interior of a tunnel

  you will see more clearly after a
while was the reply

  hall now placed his eye again at the
aperture and was unable entirely to repress
the exclamation that rose to ids lips he
remained staring through the hole for
several minutes without uttering a word
presently i noticed that the lenses of his
eye were illuminated by a ray of light
coming through the hole but he did not
stir

  after a long inspection he suddenly
applied his ear to the hole and listened
intently for at least five minutes not a
sound was audible to me but by an
occasional pressure of the hand hall
signified that some important disclosure
was reaching his sense of hearing at
length he removed his ear

  pardon me he whispered for keep-
ing you so long in waiting but what i
have just seen and overheard was of a
nature to admit of no interruption he
is still talking and by pressing your ear
against the hole you may be able to catch
what he says

  who is he

  look for yourself

  i placed my eye at the aperture and
almost recoiled with the violence of my
surprise the tunnel before me was bril-
liantly illuminated and within three feet
of the wall of rock behind which we


famous fantastic mysteries

crouched stood dr syx his dark profile
looking almost satanic in the sharp con-
trast of light and shadow he was talking
to one of his foremen and the two were
the only visible occupants of the tunnel
putting my ear to the little opening i
heard his words distinctly

  -end of their rope well theyve

spent a pretty lot of money for their ex-
perience and i rather think we shall not
be troubled again by artemisium-seekers
for some time to come

  the doctors voice ceased and instantly
i clapped my eye to the hole he had
changed his position so that his black eyes
now looked straight at the aperture my
heart was in my mouth for at first i
believed from his expression that he had
detected the gleam of my eyeball but if
so he probably mistook it for a bit of mica
in the rock and paid no further attention
then his lips moved and i put my ear
again to the hole he seemed to be reply-
ing to a question the foreman had asked

  if they do he said they will never
guess the real secret

  thereupon he turned on his heel kicked
a bit of rock off the track and strode
away toward the entrance the foreman
paused long enough to turn out the elec-
tric lamp and then followed the doctor

  well asked hall what have you
heard

  i told him everything

  it fully corroborates the evidence of
my own eyes and ears he remarked and
we may count ourselves extremely lucky
it is not likely that dr syx will be heard
a second time proclaiming his deception
with his own lips it is plain that he was
led to talk as he did to the foreman on
account of the latters having informed
him of the sudden discharge of my men
this morning their presence within ear-
shot of our hiding-place during their con-
versation was of course pure accident
and so you can see how kind fortune has
been to us i expected to have to watch
and listen and form deductions for a week
at least before getting the information
which five lucky minutes have given us

  while he was speaking my companion
busied himself in carefully plugging up
the hole in the rock when it was closed
to his satisfaction he turned on the light
in our tunnel

  did you observe he asked that there
was a second tunnel

  what do you say

  when the light was on in there i
saw the mouth of a smaller tunnel enter-
ing the main one behind the cars on the
right did you notice it

  oh yes i replied i did observe
some kind of a dark hole there but i
paid no attention to it because i was so
absorbed in the doctor

  well rejoined hall smiling it was
worth considerably more than a glance
as a matter of thought i find it even more
absorbing than dr syx did you see the
track in it

  no i had to acknowledge i did not
notice that but i continued a little
piqued by his manner being a branch of
the main tunnel i dont see anything re-
markable in its having a track also

  it was rather dim in that hole said
hall still smiling in a somewhat provok-
ing way but the railroad track was there
plain enough and whether you think it
remarkable or not i should like to lay you
a wager that that track leads to a secret
worth a dozen of the one we have just
overheard

chapter vii

a mystery indeed

when president boon had heard our
story he promptly approved halls
dismissal of the men he expressed great
surprise that dr syx should have resorted
to a deception which had been so disastrous
to innocent people and at first he talked
of legal proceedings but after thinking
the matter over he concluded that syx was
too powerful to be attacked with success
especially when the only evidence against
him was that he had claimed to find ar-
temisium in his mine at a time when as
everybody knew artemisium actually was
the moon metal



found outside the mine there was no
apparent motive for the deception and
no proof of malicious intent in short mr
boon decided that the best thing for him
and his stockholders to do was to keep
silent about their losses and await events
and at halls suggestion he also de-
termined to say nothing to anybody about
the discovery we had made

  it could do no good said hall in
making the suggestion and it might
spoil a plan i have in mind

  what plan asked the president

  i prefer not to tell just yet was the
reply

  a few days afterward i received an
invitation from hall to accompany him
once more into the abandoned tunnel

  i have found out what that side-track
means he said and it has plunged me
into another mystery so dark and pro-
found that i cannot see my way through
it i must beg you to say no word to any
one concerning what i show you

  i gave the required promise and we
entered the tunnel which nobody had
visited since our former adventure hav-
ing extinguished our lamp my companion
opened the peep-hole and a thin ray
of light streamed through from the tunnel
on the opposite side of the wall he applied
his eye to the hole

  yes he said quickly stepping back
and pushing me into his place they are
still at it look and tell me what you see
i see  replied after placing my eye
at the aperture a gang of men unloading
a car which has just come out of the side
tunnel and putting its contents upon an-
other car standing on the track of the
main tunnel

  yes and what are they handling
  why ore of course

  and do you see nothing significant in
lhat

  to be sure i exclaimed the ore
may have come back from the furnace-
room because the side tunnel turns off
so as to run parallel with the other

  it not only may have come back it
actually has come back said hall

  how can you be sure

  because i have been over the track
and know that it leads to a secret apart-
ment directly under the furnace in which
dr syx pretends to melt the ore

for a minute after hearing this avowal
i was speechless

  are you serious i asked at length

  perfectly serious run your finger along
the rock here do you perceive a seam
two days ago after seeing what you have
just witnessed in the syx tunnel i care-
fully cut out a section of the wall making
an aperture large enough to crawl through
and when i knew the workmen were asleep
i crept in there and examined both tunnels
from end to end but in solving one mys-
tery i have run myself into another
infinitely more perplexing

  how is that

  why does dr syx take such elaborate
pains to deceive his visitors and also the
government officers it is now plain that
he conducts no mining operations what-
ever this mine of his is a gigantic blind
whenever inspectors or scientific curiosity
seekers visit his mill his mute workmen
assume the air of being very busy the cars
laden with his so-called ore rumble out
of the tunnel and their contents are osten-
tatiously poured into the furnace or ap-
pear to be poured into it really dropping
into a receptacle beneath to be carried
back into the mine again and then the
doctor leads his gulled visitors around to
the other side of the furnace and shows
them the molten metal coming out in
streams

  now what does it all mean thats
what id like to find out whats his game
for mark you if he doesnt get artemisium
from this pretended ore he gets it from
some other source and right on this spot
too there is no doubt about that the
whole world is supplied by syxs furnace
with something that comes from his ten
acres of grand teton rock what is that
something how does he get it and where
does he hide it these are the things i
should like to find out


famous fantastic mysteries

  what will you do i asked

  i dont know exactly what but ive
got a dim idea which may take shape after
a while

  hall was silent for some time then he
suddenly asked

  did you ever hear of that queer show
with which dr syx entertained the mem-
bers of the financial commission

  yes ive heard the story but i dont
think it was ever made public

  no i believe not odd thing wasnt
it making a feature of the moon

  why yes very odd but just like the
doctors eccentric ways though hes
always doing something to astonish some-
body without any apparent earthly reason
but what put you in mind of that
free artemisium put me in mind of
it replied hall quizzically

  i dont see the connection

  im not sure that i do either but when
dealing with dr syx nothing is too im-
probable to be thought of

chapter viii

more of dr syxs magic

important business called me east
soon after the meeting with hall de-
scribed in the foregoing chapter and before
i again saw the grand teton very stirring
events had taken place

  after the failure of the mining opera-
tions there was a moderate revival of the
efforts to reduce the teton ore but no
success cheered the experimenters prospec-
tors also wandered all over the earth look-
ing for pure artemisium but in vain the
general public knowing nothing of what
hall had discovered and still believing
syxs story that he also had found pure
artemisium in his mine accounted for the
failure of the tunneling operations on the
supposition that the metal in a free state
was excessively rare and that dr syx had
had the luck to strike the only vein of it
that the grand teton contained as if to
give countenance to this opinion dr syx
now announced in the most public manner
that he had been deceived again and that

the vein of free metal he had struck being
exhausted no other had appeared accord-
ingly he said he must henceforth rely ex-
clusively as in the beginning upon reduc-
tion of the ore

  artemisium had proved itself an im-
mense boon to mankind and the new era
of commercial prosperity which it had
ushered in already exceeded everything
that the world had known in the past
school-children learned that human civili-
zation had taken five great strides known
respectively beginning at the bottom as
the age of stone the age of bronze
the age of iron the age of gold and
the age of artemisium

  nevertheless sources of dissatisfaction
finally began to appear and after the
nature of such things they developed with
marvelous rapidity people began to
grumble about contraction of the cur-
rency in every country there arose a
party which demanded free money
demagogues pointed to the brief reign of
paper money after the demonetization of
gold as a happy period when the people
had enjoyed their rights and the money
barons were kept at bay

  then came denunciations of the inter-
national commission for restricting the
coinage dr syx was described as a
devil-fish sucking the veins of the planet
and holding it helpless in the grasp of his
tentacular billions in the united states
meetings of agitators passed furious reso-
lutions denouncing the government assail-
ing the rich cursing dr syx and calling
upon the oppressed to rise and take
their own the final outcome was of
course violence mobs had to be sup-
pressed by military force but the most
dramatic scene in the tragedy occurred at
the grand teton excited by inflammatory
speeches and printed documents several
thousand armed men assembled in the
neighborhood of jennys lake and pre-
pared to attack the syx mine for some
reason the military guard had been de-
pleted and the mob under the leadership
of a man named bings who showed no
little talent as a commander and strategist
fhe moon metal



surprised the small force of soldiers and
locked them up in their own guard-house

  telegraphic communication having been
cut off by bings a fierce attack was made
on the mine the assailants swarmed up
the sides of the canyon and attempted to
break in through the foundation of the
buildings but the masonry was stronger
than they had anticipated and the attack
failed sharp-shooters then climbed the
neighboring heights and kept up an in-
cessant peppering of the walls

  no reply came from the gloomy struc-
ture the huge column of black smoke
rose uninterruptedly into the sky and
the noise of the great engine never ceased
for an instant the mob gathered closer
on all sides and redoubled the fire of the
rifles to which was now added the belch-
ing of several machine-guns ragged holes
began to appear in the walls and at the
sight of these the assailants yelled with
delight it was evident that the mill could
not long withstand so destructive a bom-
bardment

uddenly it became evident that the
besieged were about to take a hand in
the fight thus far they had not shown
themselves or fired a shot but now a move-
ment was perceived on the roof and the
projecting arms of some kind of machinery
became visible many marksmen concen-
trated their fire upon the mysterious ob-
jects but apparently with little effect
bings mounted  a rock so as to com-
mand a clear view of the field was on the
point of ordering a party to rush forward
with axes and beat down the formidable
doors when there came a blinding flash
from the roof something swished through
the air and a gust of heat met the assail-
ants in the face bings dropped dead from
his perch and then as if the scythe of the
destroyer had swung downward and to
the right and left in quick succession the
close-packed mob was leveled rank after
rank until the few survivors crept behind
rocks for refuge

  instantly the atmospheric broom swept
up and down the canyon and across the

mountains flanks and the marksmen fell
in bunches like shaken grapes nine-tenths
of the besiegers were destroyed within ten
minutes after the first movement had been
noticed on the roof those who survived
owed their escape to the rocks which con-
cealed them and they lost no time in
crawling off into neighboring chasms and
as soon as they were beyond eye-shot from
the mill they fled with panic speed

then the towering form of dr syx
appeared at the door emerging with-
out sign of fear or excitement he picked
his way among his fallen enemies and
approaching the military guard-house un-
did the fastening and set the imprisoned
soldiers free

  i think i am paying rather dear for
my whistle he said with a characteristic
sneer to captain carter the commander
of the troop it seems that i must not
only defend my own people and property
when attacked by mob force but must also
come to the rescue of the soldiers whose
pay-rolls are met from my pocket

  the captain made no reply and dr syx
strode back to the works when the re-
leased soldiers saw what had occurred their
amazement had no bounds it was neces-
sary at once to dispose of the dead and
this was no easy undertaking for their
small force however they accomplished
it and at the beginning of their work made
a most surprising discovery

  hows this jim said one of the men
to his comrade as they stooped to lift the
nearest victim of dr syxs withering fire
whats this fellow got all over him
artemisium pon my soul responded
jim staring at the body hes all coated
over with it

  immediately from all sides came similar
exclamations every man who had fallen
was covered with a film of the precious
metal as if he had been dipped into an
electrolytic bath clothing seemed to have
been charred and the metallic atoms had
penetrated the flesh of the victims the
rocks all around the battle-field were
similarly veneered


famous fantastic mysteries

  it looks to me said captain carter
as if old syx had turned one of his
spouts of artemisium into a hose-pipe and
soaked em with it

  thats it chimed in a lieutenant
thats exactly what hes done

  well returned the captain if he can
do that i dont see what use hes got for
us here

  probably he dont want to waste the
stuff said the lieutenant it must have
cost him plenty to plate this crowd 

  the story of the marvelous way in which
dr syx defended his mill became the
sensation of the world for many days
the hose-pipe theory struck off on the
spot by captain carter seized the popular
fancy and was generally accepted without
further question moreover no one could
deny that dr syx was well within his
rights in defending himself by any means
when so savagely attacked and his trium-
phant success no less than the ingenuity
which was supposed to underlie it placed
him in an heroic light which he had not
hitherto enjoyed

  as to the demagogues who were re-
sponsible for the outbreak and its terrible
consequences they slunk out of the public
eye and the result of the battle at the
mine seemed to have been a clearing up of
the atmosphere such as a thunderstorm
effects at the close of a season of foul
weather

  but now little as men guessed it the
beginning of the end was close at hand

chapter ix

the detective of science

the morning of my arrival at grand
teton station on my return from the
east andrew hall met me with a warm
greeting

  i have been anxiously expecting you
he said for i have made some progress
toward solving the great mystery i have
not yet reached a conclusion but i hope
soon to let you into the entire secret in
the meantime you can aid me with your
companionship if in no other way for

since the defeat of the mob this place has
been mighty lonesome i am on speaking
terms with dr syx and occasionally when
there is a party to be shown around i
visit his works and make the best pos-
sible use of my eyes captain carter of
the military is a capital fellow but i want
somebody to whom i can occasionally con-
fide things and so you are as welcome as
moonlight in harvest-time

  tell me something about that wonder-
ful fight with the mob did you see it
i did i had got wind of what bings
intended to do while i was down at poco-
tello and i hurried up here to warn the
soldiers but unfortunately i came too late
finding the military cooped up in the
guard-house and the mob masters of the
situation i kept out of sight on the side
of the teton and watched the siege with
my binocular

  what of the mysterious force that the
doctor employed to sweep off the assail-
ants

  of course captain carters suggestion
that syx turned molten artemisium from
his furnace into a hose-pipe and sprayed
the enemy with it is ridiculous but it is
much easier to dismiss carters theory than
to substitute a better one i saw the doctor
on the roof with a gang of black workmen
and i noticed the flash of polished metal
turned rapidly this way and that but
there was some intervening obstacle which
prevented me from getting a good view
of the mechanism employed it certainly
bore no resemblance to a hose-pipe or
anything of that kind no emanation was
visible from the machine but it was stupe-
fying to see the mob melt down

  how about the coating of the bodies
with artemisium

  there you are back on the hose-pipe
again laughed hall but to tell you
the truth id rather be excused from
expressing an opinion on that operation
in wholesale electro-plating just at pres-
ent ive the ghost of an idea what it
means but let me test my theory a little
before i formulate it in the meanwhile
wont you take a stroll with me
the moon metal



  certainly nothing could please me
better i replied which way shall we
go

  to the top of the grand teton
what are you seized with the moun-
tain-climbing fever

  not exactly but i have a particular
reason for wishing to take a look from
that pinnacle

  i suppose you know the real apex
of the peak has never been trodden by
man

  i do know it but it is just that apex
that i am determined to have under my
feet for ten minutes the failure of others
is no argument for us

  just as you say i rejoined but
i suppose there is no indiscretion in ask-
ing whether this little climb has any re-
lation to the mystery

  if it didnt have an important relation
to the clearing up of that dark thing i
wouldnt risk my neck in such an under-
taking was the reply

accordingly the next morning
we set out for the peak all previous
climbers as we were aware had attacked
it from the west that seemed the obvi-
ous thing to do because the westward
slopes of the mountain while very steep
are less abrupt than those which face the
rising sun in fact the eastern side of the
grand teton appears to be absolutely un-
climbable but both hall and i had had
experience with rock-climbing in the alps
and the dolomites and we knew that what
look like the hardest places sometimes
turn out to be next to the easiest accord-
ingly we decided-the more particularly
because it would save time but also be-
cause we yielde to the common desire to
outdo our predecessors-to try to scale
the giant right up his face

  we carried a very light but exceedingly
strong rope about five hundred feet long
wore nail-shod shoes and had each a metal-
pointed staff and a small hatchet in lieu
of the regular mountaineers ax advancing
at first along the broken ridge between
two gorges we gradually approached the

steeper part of the teton where the cliffs
looked so sheer and smooth that it seemed
no wonder that nobody had ever tried to
scale them the air was deliciously clear
and the sky wonderfully blue above the
mountains and the moon a few days past
its last quarter was visible in the south-
west its pale crescent face slightly blued
by the atmosphere as it always appears
when seen in daylight

    slow westering a phantom sail-

     the lonely soul of yesterday

behind us somewhat north of east
lay the syx works with their black
smoke rising almost vertically in the still
air suddenly as we stumbled along on the
rough surface something whizzed past my
face and fell on the rock at my feet i
looked at the strange missile that had come
like a meteor out of open space with
astonishment

  it was a bird it lay motionless its out-
stretched wings having a curious shriveled
aspect while the flaming color of the
breast was half obliterated with smutty
patches stooping to pick it up i noticed a
slight bronzing which instantly recalled
to my mind the peculiar appearance of
the victims of the attack on the mine

  look here i called to hall who
was several yards in advance he turned
and i held up the bird by a wing

  where did you get that he asked

  it fell at my feet a moment ago

  hall glanced in a startled manner at
the sky and then down the slope of the
mountain

  did you notice in what direction it
was flying he asked

  no it dropped so close that it almost
grazed my nose i saw nothing of it until
it made me blink

  i have been heedless muttered hall
under his breath at the time i did not
notice the singularity of his remark my
attention being absorbed in contemplating
the unfortunate tanager

  look how its feathers are scorched
i said


famous fantastic mysteries

  i know it hall replied without
glancing at the bird

  and it is covered with a film of ar-
temisium i added a little piqued by his
abstraction

  i know that too 

  see here hall i exclaimed are
you trying to make game of me

  not at all my dear fellow he re-
plied dropping his cogitation pray for-
give me but this is no new phenomenon
to me i have picked up birds in that
condition on this mountain before there
is a terrible mystery here but i am slowly
letting light into it and if we succeed in
reaching the top of the peak i have good
hope that the illumination will increase

  here now he added a moment later
sitting down upon a rock and thrusting
the blade of his penknife into a crevice
what do you think of this

  he held up a little nugget of pure ar-
temisium and then went on

  you know that all this slope was
swept as clean as a dutch housewifes
kitchen floor by the thousands of miners
and prospectors who swarmed over it a
year or two ago and do you suppose they
would have missed such a tidbit if it had
been here then

  dr syx must have been salting the
mountain again i suggested

  well replied hall with a signifi-
cant smile if the doctor hasnt salted it
somebody else has thats plain enough
but perhaps you would like to know pre-
cisely what i expect to find out when we

get on the topknot of the teton

  i should certainly be delighted to learn
the object of our journey i said assur-
ingly

  it is of supreme importance to the
success of my plans in a word i hope
to be able to look down into a part of
dr syxs mill which if i am not mis-
taken no human eye except his and those
of his most trustworthy helpers has ever
been permitted to see and if i see there
what i fully expect to see i shall have
got a long step nearer to a great fortune
good i cried en avant then we
are losing time

chapter x

the top of the grand teton

the climbing soon became difficult un-
til at length we were going up hand
over hand taking advantage of crevices
and knobs which an inexperienced eye
would have regarded as incapable of af-
fording a grip for the fingers or a support
for the toes presently we arrived at the
foot of a stupendous precipice which was
absolutely insurmountable by any ordinary
method of ascent parts of it overhung
and everywhere the face of the rock was
too free from irregularities to afford foot-
ing except to a fly

  now to borrow the expression of old
bunyan we are hard put to it i re-
marked if you will go to the left i will
take the right and see if there is any
chance of getting up

  i dont believe we could find any place
easier than this hall replied and so
up we go where we are

  have you a pair of wings concealed
about you i asked laughing at his
folly

  well something nearly as good he
responded unstrapping his knapsack he
produced a silken bag which he unfolded
on the rock

  a balloon i exclaimed but how
are you going to inflate it

  for reply hall showed me a receptacle
which he said contained liquid hydrogen

  this balloon i made for our present
purpose it will just suffice to carry up
our rope and a small but practically un-
breakable grapple of hardened gold i
calculate to send the grapple to the top
of the precipice with the balloon and when
it has obtained a firm hold in the riven
rock there we can ascend sailor fashion
you see the rope has knots and i know
your muscles are perfectly trustworthy in
such work

  there was a slight breeze from the east-
ward and the current of air slanting up
the face of the peak assisted the balloon
in mounting with its burden and favored
us by promptly swinging the little airship
with the grapple swaying beneath it over
the brow of the cliff into the atmospheric
eddy above as soon as we saw that the
grapple was well over the edge we pulled
upon the rope the balloon instantly shot
into view with the anchor dancing but
under the influence of the wind quickly
returned to its former position behind the
projecting brink the grapple had failed
to take hold

   try try again must be our motto
now muttered hall

  we tried several times with the same
result although each time we slightly
shifted our position at last the grapple
caught

  now all together cried my com-
panion and simultaneously we threw our
weight upon the slender rope the anchor
apparently did not give an inch

  let me go first said hall pushing

me aside as i caught the first knot above
my head its my device and its only
fair that i should have the first try

  in a minute he was many feet up the
wall climbing swiftly hand over hand
but occasionally stopping and twisting his
leg around the rope while he took breath

  its easier than i expected he called
down when he had ascended about one
hundred feet here and there the rock
offers a little hold for the knees

  i watched him breathless with anxiety
and as he got higher my imagination
pictured the little gold grapple invisible
above the brow of the precipice with per-
haps a single thin prong wedged into a
crevice and slowly ploughing its way to-
ward the edge with each impulse of the
climber until but another pull was needed
to set it flying so vivid was my fancy
that i tried to banish it by noticing that
a certain knot in the rope remained just
at the level of my eyes where it had been
from the start hall was now fully two
hundred feet above the ledge on which i
stood and was rapidly nearing the top
of the precipice in a minute more he
would be safe

  suddenly he shouted and glancing up
with a leap of the heart  saw that he
was falling he kept his face to the rock
and came down feet foremost it would
be useless to attempt any description of
my feelings i would not go through that
experience again for the price of a battle-
ship yet it lasted less than a second he
had dropped not more than ten feet when
the fall was arrested

  all right he called cheerily no
harm done it was only a slip

  but what a slip if the balloon had not
carried the anchor several yards back
from the edge it would have had no op-
portunity to catch another hold as it shot
forward and how could we know that
the second hold would prove more secure
than the first hall did not hesitate how-
ever for one instant up he went again
fiut in fact his best chance was in going
up for he was within four yards of the
top when the mishap occurred with a


famous fantastic mysteries

 sigh of relief i saw him at last throw his
 arm over the verge and then wriggle his
 body upon the ledge a few seconds later
 he was lying on his stomach with his face
 over the edge looking down at me

    come on he shouted its all right

 when i had pulled myself over the
 brink at his side i grasped his hand
 and pressed it without a word we under-
 stood each other

   it was pretty close to a miracle he
 remarked at last look at this

   the rock over which the grapple had
 slipped was deeply scored by the unyield-
 ing point of the metal and exactly at the
 verge of the precipice the prong had
 wedged itself into a narrow crack so firmly
 that we had to chip away the stone in
 order to release it if it had slipped a single
 inch farther before taking hold it would
 have been all over with my friend

   such experiences shake the strongest
 nerves and we sat on the shelf we had
 attained for fully a quarter of an hour
 before we ventured to attack the next
 precipice which hung beetling directly
 above us it was not as lofty as the one
 we had just ascended but it impended
 to such a degree that we saw we should
 have to climb our rope while it swung
 free in the air

    luckily we had little difficulty in get-
 ting a grip for the prongs and we took
 every precaution to test the security of
 the anchorage not only putting our com-
 t bined weight repeatedly upon the rope
 but flipping and jerking it with all our
 strength the grapple resisted every effort
 to dislodge it and finally i started up
 insisting on my turn as leader

   the height i had to ascend did not
 exceed one hundred feet but that is a
 very great distance to climb on a swing-
 ing rope without a wall within reach to
 assist by its friction and occasional
 friendly projections in a little while my
 movements together with the effect of
 the slight wind had imparted a most
 distressing oscillation to the rope this
 sometimes carried me with a nerve-shak-

 ing bang against a prominent point of
 the precipice where i would dislodge
 loose fragments that kept hall dodging
 for his life and then i would swing out
 apparently beyond the brow of the cliff
 below so that as i involuntarily glanced
 downward i seemed to be hanging in
 free space while the steep mountainside
 looking ten times steeper than it really
 was resembled the vertical wall of an
 absolutely bottomless abyss as if i were
 suspended over the edge of the world

  i avoided thinking of what the grapple
might be about and in my haste to get
through with the awful experience i
worked myself fairly out of breath so
that when at last i reached the rounded
brow of the cliff i had to stop and cling
there for fully a minute before i could
summon strength enough to lift myself
over it

  when i was assured that the grapple
was still securely fastened i signalled to
hall and he soon stood at my side ex-
claiming as he wiped the perspiration from
his face

  i think ill try wings next time

  but our difficulties had only begun as
we had foreseen it was a case of alp above
alp to the very limit of human strength
and patience however it would have
been impossible to go back in order to
descend the two precipices we had sur-
mounted it would have been necessary to
leave our lifelines clinging to the rocks
and we had not rope enough to do that if
we could not reach the top we were lost

having refreshed ourselves with a
bite to eat and a little stimulant
we resumed the climb after several hours
of the most exhausting work i have ever
performed we pulled our weary limbs upon
the narrow ridge but a few square yards
in area which constitutes the apex of the
grand teton a little below on the oppo-
site side of a steep-walled gap which di-
vides the top of the mountain into two
parts we saw the singular inclosure of
stones which the early white explorers
found there and which they ascribed to
the moon metal



the indians although nobody has ever
known who built it or what purpose it
served

  the view was of course superb but
while i was admiring it in all its wonder-
ful extent and variety hall who had im-
mediately pulled out his binocular was
busy inspecting the syx works the top
of whose great tufted smoke column was
thousands of feet beneath our level

  there suddenly exclaimed hall i
thought  should find it

 what

  take a look through my glass at the
roof of syxs mill look just in the center
why its open in the middle i cried
as soon as i had put the glass to my eyes
theres a big circular hole in the center
of the roof

  look inside look inside repeated
hall impatiently

  i see something bright

 youve been in the syx works many
times havent you

 yes

  did you ever see the opening in the
roof

  never

  did you ever hear of it

  never

  then dr syx doesnt show his visitors
 everything that is to be seen

  evidently not since as we know he
concealed the double tunnel and the room
under the furnace

  dr syx has concealed a bigger secret
 than that hall responded and the
 grand teton has helped me to a glimpse
 of it

  for several minutes my friend was ab-
sorbed in thought then he broke out

  i tell you hes the most wonderful
man in the world

  who dr svx well ive long thought
 that

  well now said hall rubbing his
hands with a satisfied air while his eyes
glanced keen and bright with the reflec-
tion of some passing thought max syx
is greater than any alchemist that ever
lived if those old fellows in the dark ages

 had accomplished everything they set out
 to do they would have been of no more
 consequence in comparison with our black-
 browed friend down yonder than-than
 my head is of gonsequence in comparison
 with the moon

  i fear you flatter the man in the
moon was my laughing reply

  no i dont returned hall and
some day youll admit it

  well what about that something that
shines down there you seem to see more
in it than i can

  but my companion had fallen into a
reverie and didnt hear my question he
was gazing abstractedly at the faint image
of the waning moon now nearing the
distant mountain-top over in idaho pres-
ently his mind seemed to return to the
old magnet and he whirled about and
glanced down at the syx mill the column
of smoke was diminishing in volume an
indication that the engine was about to
enjoy one of its periodical rests the ir-
regularity of these stoppages had always
been a subject of remark among practical
engineers the hours of labor were ex-
ceedingly erratic but the engine had never
been known to work at night except on
one occasion and then only for a few
minutes when it was suddenly stopped on
account of a fire

  just as hall resumed his inspection
two huge quarter spheres which had been
resting wide apart on the roof moved
toward one another until their arched sec-
tions met over the circular aperture which
they covered like the dome of an ob-
servatory

  i expected it hall remarked but
come it is mid-afternoon and we shall
need all of our time to get safely down
before the light fades

  letting ourselves down with the rope
into the hollow way that divides the sum-
mit of the teton into two pinnacles we
had no difficulty in descending by the
route followed by all previous climbers
the weather was fine and having found
good shelter among the rocks we passed
the night in comfort the next day we


famous fantastic mysteries

succeeded in swinging round upon the
eastern flank of the teton below the more
formidable cliffs and just at nightfall we
arrived at the station as we passed the
syx mine the doctor himself confronted
us there was a very displeasing look on
his countenance and his sneer was strongly
marked

 so you have been on top of the
teton he said

  yes replied hall very blandly and
if you have a taste for that sort of thing
i should advise you to go up the view
is immense-as fine as the best in the
alps

  pretty ingenious plan that balloon of
yours continued the doctor still looking
black

  thank you hall replied more suavely
than ever ive been planning that a long
time you probably dont know that moun-
taineering used to be my chief amuse-
ment

  the doctor turned away without pur-
suing the conversation

  i could kick myself hall muttered
as soon as dr syx was out of earshot
if my absurd wish to outdo others had
not blinded me i should have known that
he would see us going up this side of the
peak particularly with the balloon to give
us away however whats done cant be
undone he may not really suspect the
truth and if he does he cant help him-
self even though he is the richest man in
the world

strange fate of a kite

 a re you ready for another tramp
was andrew halls greeting when
we met early on the morning following
our return from the peak

  certainly i am what is your program
for today

  i wish to test the flying qualities of
a kite which i have constructed since our
return last night

  you dont allow the calls of sleep to
interfere very much with your activity

  i havent much time for sleep just
now repiled hall without smiling the
kite test will carry us up the flanks of the
teton but i am not going to try for the
top this time if you will come along ill
ask you to help me by carrying and oper-
ating a light transit i shall carry another
myself i am desirous to get the elevation
that the kite attains and certain other
data that will be of use to me we will
make a detour toward the south for i
dont want old syxs suspicions to be prod-
ded any more

  what interest can he have in your
kite-flying

  the same interest that a burglar has in
the rap of a policemans night-stick

  in a few hours we were clambering over
the broken rocks on the southeastern flank
of the teton at an elevation of about
three thousand feet above the level of
jacksons hole finally hall paused and
began to put his kite together

  in order to diminish the chances of
dr syx noticing what we are about he
said as he worked away i have covered
the kite with sky-blue paper this to-
gether with distance will probably insure
us against his notice

  having ascertained the direction of the
wind with much attention he stationed
me with my transit on a commanding
rock and sought another post for him-
self at a distance of two hundred yards
which he carefully measured with a gold
tape my instructions were to keep the
telescope on the kite as soon as it had
attained a considerable height and to
note the angle of elevation and the hori-
zontal angle with the base line joining
our points of observation

  be particularly careful was halls in-
junction and if anything happens to the
kite note the angles at that instant

  as soon as we had fixed our stations
hall began to pay out the string and the
kite rose very swiftly as it sped away
into the blue it was soon practically in-
visible to the naked eye although the
telescope of the transit enabled me to fol-
low it with ease
the moon metal



  dont lose sight of it now for an in-
stant he shouted

  for at least half an hour he continued
to manipulate the string sending the kite
now high toward the zenith with a sudden
pull and then letting it drift off it seemed
at last to become almost a fixed point very
slowly the angles changed when suddenly
there was a flash and to my amazement
i saw the paper of the kite shrivel and
disappear in a momentary flame and then
the bare sticks came tumbling out of the
sky

  did you get the angles yelled hall
excitedly

  yes the telescope is yet pointed on
the spot where the kite disappeared
read them off he called and then
get your angle with the syx works

  all right i replied doing as he had
requested and noticing at the same time
that he was in the act of putting his watch
in his pocket is there anything else
i asked

  no that will do thank you

  hall came running over his face beam-
ing and with the air of a man who has
just hooked a particularly cunning old
trout

  ah he exclaimed this has been a
great success i could almost dispense
with the calculation but it is best to be
sure

 what are you about anyhow i
asked and what was it that happened
to the kite

  dont interrupt me just now please
was the only reply i received

  thereupon my friend sat down on a
rock pulled out a pad of paper noted the
angles which t had read on the transit
and fell to figuring with feverish haste in
the course of his work he consulted a
pocket almanac then glanced up at the
sky muttered approvingly and finally
leaped to his feet with a half-suppressed
hurrah

  will you kindly tell me i asked how
you managed to set the kite afire

  hall laughed heartily you thought it
was a trick did you said he well it
was no trick but a very beautiful demon-

stration you surely havent forgotten the
bird that gave you such a surprise the day
before yesterday

  do you mean i exclaimed startled
at the suggestion that the fate of the
bird had any connection with the accident
to your kite

  accident isnt precisely the right
word replied hall the two things are
as intimately related as own brothers if
you should care to hunt up the kite sticks
you would find that they too are now
artemisium plated

what do you propose to do next
to shake the dust of the grand teton
from my shoes and go to san francisco
where i have an extensive laboratory
so you are going to try a little al-
chemy yourself are you

  perhaps who knows at any rate my
good friend i am forever indebted to you
for your assistance and even more for
your discretion and if i succeed you shall
be the first person in the world to hear
the news

chapter xii

better than alchemy

for six months after halls departure
for san francisco i heard nothing
from him in the meantime things ran on
as usual in the world only a ripple being
caused by renewed discoveries of small
nuggets of artemisium on the tetons a
fact which recalled to my mind the re-
mark of my friend when he dislodged a
flake of the metal from a crevice during
our ascent of the peak at last one day i
received this telegram at my office in new
york

            san francisco may  

come at once the mystery is solved

                          signed hall

  as soon as i could pack a grip i was
flying westward one hundred miles an
hour on reaching san francisco i hast-
ened to halls laboratory he was there
expecting me and after a hearty greet-
ing during which his elation over his suc-
cess was manifest he said


famous fantastic mysteries

  i am compelled to ask you to make a
little journey i found it impossible to se-
cure the necessary privacy here and be-
fore opening my experiments i selected
a site for a new laboratory in an unfre-
quented spot among the mountains this
side of lake tahoe you will be the first
man with the exception of my two de-
voted assistants to see my apparatus and
you shall share the sensation of the critical
experiment

  from the nearest railway station we
took horses to the laboratory which oc-
cupied a secluded but most beautiful site
at an elevation of about six thousand feet
above sea-level with considerable surprise
i noticed a building surmounted with a
dome recalling what we had seen from
the grand teton on the roof of dr syxs
mill hall observing my look smiled sig-
nificantly but said nothing the labora-
tory proper occupied a smaller building
adjoining the domed structure hall led
the way into an apartment having but a
single door and illuminated by a skylight

  near one end of the room which was
about thirty feet in length was a table on
which lay a glass tube about two inches in
diameter and thirty inches long in the
farther end of the tube gleamed a lump
of yellow metal which i took to be gold
hall and i were seated near another table
about twenty-five feet distant from the
tube and on this table was an apparatus
furnished with a concave mirror whose
optical axis was directed toward the tube
it occurred to me at once that this appa-
ratus would be suitable for experimenting
with electric waves wires ran from- it to
the floor and in the cellar beneath was
audible the beating of an engine my com-
panion made an adjustment or two and
then remarked

  now keep your eyes on the lump of
gold in the farther end of the tube yonder
the tube is exhausted of air and i am
about to concentrate upon the gold an
intense electric influence which will have
the effect of making it a kind of kathode
pole i only use this term for the sake of
illustration you will recall that as long

ago as the days of crookes it was known
that a kathode in an exhausted tube would
project particles or atoms of its substance
away in straight lines now watch

  i fixed my attention upon the gold and
presently saw it enveloped in a most beau-
tiful violet light this grew more intense
until at times it was blinding while at
the same moment the interior of the tube
seemed to have become charged with a
luminous vapor of a delicate pinkish hue

  watch watch said hall look at
the nearer end of the tube

  why it is becoming coated with gold
i exclaimed

  he smiled but made no reply still the
strange process continued the pink vapor
became so dense that the lump of gold
was no longer visible although the eye of
violet light glared piercingly through the
colored fog every second the deposit of
metal shining like a mirror increased un-
til suddenly there came a curious whis-
tling sound hall who had been adjusting
the mirror jerked away his hand and gave
it a flip as if hot water had spattered it
and then the light in the tube quickly died
away the vapor escaped filling the room
with a peculiar stimulating odor and i
perceived that the end of the glass tube
had been melted through and the molten
gold was slowly dripping from it

  i carried it a little too far said hall
ruefully rubbing the back of his hand
and when the glass gave way under
the atomic bombardment a few atoms of
gold visited my bones but there is no
harm done you observe that the instant
the air reached the kathode as i for con-
venience call the electrified mass of gold
the action ceased

  but your anode to continue your sim-
ile i said is constantly exposed to the
air

  true he replied but in the first
place of course this is not really an anode
just as the other is not actually a kathode
as science advances we are compelled for
a time to use old terms in a new sense
until a fresh nomenclature can be invented
but we are now dealing with a form of
the moon metal



electric action more subtle in its effects
than any at present described in the text-
books and the transactions of learned so-
cieties i have not yet even attempted to
work out the theory of it i am only con-
cerned with its facts

  but wonderful as the exhibition you
have given is i do not see i said how
it concerns dr syx and his artemisium

isten replied hall settling back
in his chair after disconnecting his
apparatus you no doubt have been told
how one night the syx engine was heard
working for a few minutes the first and
only night work it was ever known to
have done and how hardly had it started
up when a fire broke out in the mill and
the engine was instantly stopped now
there is a very remarkable story connected
with that and it will show you how i got
my first clue to the mystery although it
was rather a mere suspicion than a clue
for at first i could make nothing out of it
the alleged fire occurred about a fort-
night after our discovery of the double
tunnel my mind was then full of suspi-
cions concerning syx because i thought
that a man who would fool people with
one hand was not likely to deal fairly
with the other

  it was a glorious night with a full
moon whose face was so clear in the limpid
air that having found a snug place at the
foot of a yellow-pine tree where the
ground was carpeted with odoriferous
needles i lay on my back and renewed
my early acquaintance with the roman-
tically named mountains and seas of the
lunar globe with my binocular i could
trace those long white streaks which radi-
ate from the crater ring called tycho
and run hundreds of miles in all directions
over the moon as i gazed at tfiese singu-
lar objects i recalled the various theories
which astronomers puzzled bv their enig-
matical aspect have offered to a more or
less confiding public concerning them

  in the midst of my meditation and
moon-gazing i was startled by hearing the
engine in the syx works suddenly begin

to run immediately a queer light shaped
like the beam of a ships searchlight but
reddish in color rose high in the moonlit
heavens above the mill it did not last
more than a minute or two for almost
instantly the engine was stopped and with
its stoppage the light faded and disap-
peared the next day dr syx gave it out
that on starting up his engine in the
night something had caught fire which
compelled him immediately to shut down
again the few who had seen the light
with the exception of your humble serv-
ant accepted the doctors explanation
without a question but i knew there had
been no fire and syxs anxiety to spread
the lie led me to believe that he had nar-
rowly escaped giving away a vital secret
i said nothing about my suspicions but
upon inquiry i found out that an extra
and pressing order for metal had arrived
from the government the very day of the
pretended fire and i drew the inference
that syx in his haste to fill the order-
his supply having been drawn low-had
started to work contrary to his custom
at night and had immediately found rea-
son to repent his rashness of course i
connected the strange light with this sud-
den change of mind

  my suspicion having been thus stim-
ulated and having been directed in a cer-
tain way i began from that moment to
notice closely the hours during which the
engine labored at night it was always
quiet except on that one brief occasion
sometimes it began early in the morning
and stopped about noon at other times
the work was done entirely in the after-
noon beginning sometimes as late as three
or four oclock and ceasing invariably at
sundown then again it would start at
sunrise and continue the whole day
through

  for a long time i was unable to ac-
count for these eccentricities and the prob-
lem was not rendered much clearer al-
though a startling suggestiveness was
added to it when at length i noticed that
the periods of activity of the engine had
a definite relation to the age of the moon


famous fantastic mysteries

then i discovered with the aid of an
almanac that i could predict the hours
when the engine would be busy

  at the time of new moon it worked
all day at full moon it was idle between
full moon and last quarter it labored in
the forenoon the length of its working
hours increasing as the quarter was ap-
proached between last quarter and new
moon the hours of work lengthened until
as i have said at new moon they lasted
all day between new moon and first
quarter work began later and later in the
forenoon as the quarter was approached
and between first quarter and full moon
the laboring hours rapidly shortened be-
ing confined to the latter part of the after-
noon until at full moon complete silence
reigned in the mill

ell well i broke in astonished
by the singular recital you must
have thought dr syx was a cross between
an alchemist and an astrologer

note this said hall disregarding my
interruption the hours when the engine
worked were invariably the hours during
which the moon was above the horizon
what did you infer from that

  of course i inferred that the moon
was directly concerned in the mystery
but how that bothered me for a long
time but a little light broke into my mind
when i picked up on the mountainside
a dead bird whose scorched feathers were
bronzed with artemisium then came the
attack on the mine and its tragic finish i
have already told you what i observed
on that occasion but instead of helping
to clear up the mystery it rather compli-
cated it for a time at length however i
reasoned my way partly out of the diffi-
culty certain things which i had noticed
in the syx mill convinced me that tneie
was a part of the building whose exist-
ence no visitor suspected and putting one
thing with another i inferred that the
roof must be open above that secret part
of the structure and that if i could get
upon a sufficiently elevated place i could
see something of what was hidden there

  at this point in the investigation i pro-
posed to you the trip to the top of the
teton the result of which you remember
i called your attention to a shining object
underneath the circular opening in the
roof you could not make out what it was
but i saw enough to convince me that it
was a gigantic parabolic mirror ill show
you a smaller one of the same kind pres-
ently

  now at last i began to perceive the
real truth but it was so wildly incredible
so infinitely remote from all human ex-
perience that  hardly ventured to formu-
late it even in my own secret mind but
i was bound to see the thing through to
the end it occurred to me that i could
prove the accuracy of my theory with
the aid of a kite you were kind enough
to lend your assistance in that experiment
and it gave me irrefragable evidence of
the existence of a shaft of flying atoms
extending in a direct line between dr
syxs pretended mine and the moon
hall f exclaimed you are mad
my friend smiled good-naturedly and
went on with his story

  the instant the kite shriveled and dis-
appeared i understood why the works were
idle when the moon was not above the
horizon why birds flying across that fatal
beam fell dead upon the rocks and whence
the terrible master of that mysterious mill
derived the power of destruction that
could wither an army as the assyrian
host in byrons poem

melted like snow in the glance of the lord 

  but how did dr syx turn the flying
atoms against his enemies i asked

  in a very simple manner he had a
mirror mounted so that it could be turned
in any direction and would shunt the
stream of metallic atoms heated by their
friction with the air toward any desired
point when the attack came he raised
this machine above the level of the roof
and swept the mob to a lustrous if ex-
pensive death

  and the light at night-
the moon metal



  was the shining of the heated atoms
not luminous enough to be visible in broad
day for which reason the engine never
worked at night and the stream of volatil-
ized artemisium was never set flowing at
full moon when the lunar globe is above
the horizon only during the hours of dark-
ness

  i see i said whence came the nug-
gets on the mountain some of the atoms
owing to the resistance of the air fell
short and settled in the form of impalpable
dust until the winds and rains collected
and compacted them in the cracks and
crevices of the rocks

  that was it of course

  and now i added my amazement
at the success of halls experiments and
the accuracy of his deductions increasing
every moment do you say that you have
also discovered the means employed by
dr syx to obtain artemisium from the
moon

  not only that replied my friend
but within the next few minutes i shall
have the pleasure of presenting to you a
button of moon metal fresh from the veins
of artemis herself

chapter xiii

the looting of the moon

i shall spare the reader a recital of
the tireless efforts continuing through
many almost sleepless weeks whereby an-
drew hall obtained his clue to dr syxs
method it was manifest from the begin-
ning that the agent concerned must be
some form of etheric or so-called electric
energy but how to set it in operation was
the problem finally he hit upon the ap-
paratus for his initial experiments which
i have already described

  recurring to what had been done a
century ago by hertz when he concen-
trated electric waves upon a focal point
by means of a concave mirror said hall
i saw that the key i wanted lay in an
extension of these experiments at last i
found that i could transform electrical
energy into ether waves which when they

had been concentrated upon a metallic
object like a chunk of gold imparted to
it an intense charge of an apparently elec-
tric nature upon thus charging a metallic
body enclosed in a vacuum i observed
that the energy imparted to it possessed
the remarkable power of disrupting its
atoms and projecting them off in straight
lines very much as occurs with a kathode
in a crookes tube but-and this was of
supreme importance- found that the
line of projection was directly toward the
apparatus from which the impulse pro-
ducing the charge had come in other
words i could produce two poles between
which a marvelous interaction occurred
my transformer with its concentrating
mirror acted as one pole from which en-
ergy was transferred to the other pole
and that other pole immediately flung off
atoms of its own substance in the direc-
tion of the transformer but these atoms
were stopped by the glass wall of the
vacuum tube and when i tried the ex-
periment with the metal removed from the
vacuum and surrounded with air it failed
utterly

  this at first completely discouraged 
me until i suddenly remembered that
the moon is in a vacuum the great vacuum
of interplanetary space and that it pos-
sesses no perceptible atmosphere of its
own at this a great light broke around
me and i shouted eureka without hesi-
tation i constructed a transformer of great
power furnished with a large parabolic
mirror to transmit the waves in parallel
lines erected the machinery and buildings
here and when all was ready for the final
experiment i telegraphed for you

  prepared by these explanations i was
all on fire to see the thing tried hall was
no less eager and calling in his two
faithful assistants to make the final ad-
justments he led the way into what he
facetiously named the lunar chamber

  if we fail he remarked with a smile
that had an element of worriment in it
it will become the lunatic chamber-
but no danger of that you observe this
polished silver knob supported by a


famous fantastic mysteries

metallic rod curved over at the top like
a crane that constitutes the pole from
which i propose to transmit the energy
to the moon and upon which i expect the
storm of atoms to be centered by reflec-
tion from the mirror at whose focus it is
placed

  one moment i said am i to under-
stand that you think that the moon is a
solid mass of artemisium and that no mat-
ter where your radiant force strikes it a
kathodic pole will be formed there from
which atoms will be projected to the
earth

  no said hall i must carefully
choose the point on the lunar surface
where to operate but that will present
no difficulty  made up my mind as soon
as i had penetrated syxs secret that he
obtained the metal from those mystic
white streaks which radiate from tycho
and which have puzzled the astronomers
ever since the invention of telescopes i
now believe those streaks to be composed
of immense veins of the metal that syx
has most appropriately named artemis-
ium which you of course recognize as
being derived from the name of the greek
goddess of the moon artemis whom the
romans called diana but now to work

it was less than a day past the time
of new moon and the earths satellite
was too near the sun to be visible in broad
daylight accordingly the mirror had to
be directed by means of knowledge of the
moons place in the sky driven by ac-
curate clockwork it could be depended
upon to retain the proper direction when
once set

  with breathless interest i watched the
proceedings of my friend and his assist-
ants when everything had been adjusted
to his satisfaction hall stepped back not
without betraying his excitement in flushed
cheeks and flashing eyes and pressed a
lever the powerful engine underneath the
floor instantly responded the experiment
was begun

  i have set it upon a point about a
hundred miles north of tycho where the

yerkes photographs show a great abund-
ance of the white substance said hall

  then we waited a minute elapsed a
bird fluttering in the opening above for
a second or two wrenched our strained
nerves halls face turned pale

  they had better keep away from here
he whispered with a ghastly smile

  two minutes i could hear the beating
of my heart the engine shook the floor

  three minutes halls face was wet
with perspiration the bird blundered in
and startled us again

  four minutes we were like statues
with all eyes fixed on the polished ball of
silver which shone in the brilliant light
concentrated upon it by the mirror

  five minutes the shining ball had be-
come a confused blue and i violently
winked to clear my vision

  at last thank heaven there it
is

  it was hall who spoke trembling like
an aspen the silver knob had changed
color what seemed a miniature rainbow
surrounded it with concentric circles of
blinding brilliance

  then something dropped flashing into
an earthen dish set beneath the ball an-
other glittering drop followed and at a
shorter interval another

  almost before a word could be uttered
the drops had coalesced and became a tiny
stream which as it fell twisted itself into
a bright spiral gleaming writh a hundred
shifting hues and forming on the bottom
of the dish a glowing interlacing maze
of viscid rings and circlets which turned
and twined about and over one another
until they had blended and settled into
a button-shaped mass of hot metallic
jelly hall snatched the dish away and
placed another in its stead

  this will be about right for a watch
charm when it cools he said with a re-
turn of his customary self-command i
promised you the first specimen ill catch
another for myself

  but can it be possible that we are not
dreaming i exclaimed do you really
believe that this comes from the moon
the moon metal



  just as surely as rain comes from the
clouds cried hall with all his old im-
patience havent i just showed you the
whole process

  then i congratulate you you will be
as rich as dr syx

  perhaps was the unperturbed reply

six weeks later the financial centers of
the earth were shaken by the news
that a new supply of artemisium was be-
ing marketed from a mill which had been
secretly opened in the sierras of california
for a time there was almost a panic if
hall had chosen to do so he might have
precipitated serious trouble but he im-
mediately entered into negotiations with
government representatives and the inev-
itable result was that to preserve the
monetary system of the world from up-
heaval dr syx had to consent that halls
mill should share equally with his in the
production of artemisium during the ne-
gotiations the doctor paid a visit to halls
establishment the meeting between them
was most dramatic syx tried to blast his
rival with a glance but knowledge is
power and my friend faced his mysterious
antagonist whose deepest secrets he had
penetrated with an unflinching eye it
was remarked that dr syx became a
changed man from that moment his mas-
terful air seemed to have deserted him
and it was with something resembling hu-
mility that he assented to the arrange-
ment which required him to share his
enormous gains with his conqueror

  of course halls success led to an im-
mediate recrudescence of the efforts to ex-
tract artemisium from the syx ore and
equally of course every such attempt
failed hall while keeping his own secret
did all he could to discourage the experi-
ments but they naturally believed that
he must have made the very discovery
which was the subject of their dreams and
he could not without betraying himself
and upsetting the finances of the planet
directly undeceive them the consequence
was that fortunes were wasted in hope-
less experimentation and with halls

achievement dazzling their eyes the de-
luded fortune-seekers kept on in the face
of endless disappointments and disaster

and presently there came another
tragedy the syx mill was blown up
the accident-although many people re-
fused to regard it as an accident and
asserted that the doctor himself in his
chagrin had applied the match-the ex-
plosion then occurred about sundown and
its effects were awful the great works
with everything pertaining to them and
every rail that they contained were blown
to atoms they disappeared as if they
had never existed even the twin tunnels
were involved in the ruin a vast cavity
being left in the mountainside where syxs
ten acres had been the force of the ex-
plosion was so great that the shattered
rock was reduced to dust to this fact
was attributed the escape of the troops
while the mountain was shaken to its
core and enormous parapets of living
rock were hurled down the precipices of
the teton no missiles of appreciable size
traversed the air and not a man at the
camp was injured but jacksons hole
filled with red dust looked for days after-
ward like the mouth of a tremendous vol-
cano just after an eruption dr syx had
been seen entering the mill a few minutes
before the catastrophe by a sentinel who
was stationed about a quarter of a mile
away and who although he was felled
like an ox by the shock and had his eyes
ears and nostrils filled with flying dust
miraculously escaped with his life

  after this a new arrangement was made
whereby andrew hall became the sole
producer of artemisium and his wealth
began to mount toward the starry heights
of the billions

  about a year after the explosion of the
syx mill a strange rumor got about it
came first from budapest in hungary
where it was averred several persons of
credibility had seen dr max syx mil-
lions had been familiar with his face and
his personal peculiarites through actually
meeting him as well as through photo-


famous fantastic mysteries

graphs and descriptions and unless there
was an intention to deceive it did not
seem possible that a mistake could be
made in identification there surely never
was another man who looked just like
dr syx and yet was it not demonstrable
that he must have perished in the awful
destruction of his mill

  soon after came a report that dr syx
had been seen again this time at ekater-
inburg in the urals next he was said to
have paid a visit to batang in the moun-
tainous district of southwestern china
and finally according to rumor he was
seen in sicily at nicolosi among the vol-
canic pimples on the southern slope of
mount etna

  next followed something of more cur-
ious and even startling interest a chem-
ist at budapest where the first rumors
of syxs reappearance had placed the mys-
terious doctor announced that he could
produce artemisium and proved it al-
though he kept his process secret hardly
had the sensation caused by this news
partially subsided when a similar report
arrived from ekaterinburg then another
from batang after that a fourth from
nicolosi

  nobody could fail to notice the co-
incidence wherever the doctor-or was
it his ghost-appeared there shortly
afterward somebody discovered the much-
sought secret

  after this syxs apparitions rapidly in-
creased in frequency followed in each
instance by the announcement of an-
other productive artemisium mill he ap-
peared in germany italy france eng-
land and finally at many places in the
united states

  it is the old doctors revenge said
hall to me one day trying to smile al-
though the matter was too serious to be
taken humorously yes it is his re-
venge and i must admit that it is com-
plete the price of artemisium has fallen
one-half within six months all the efforts
we have made to hold back the flood have
proved useless the secret itself is be-
coming public property we shall inev-

itably be overwhelmed with artemisium
just as we were with gold and the last
condition of the financial world will be
worse than the first

  my friends gloomy prognostications
came near being fulfilled to the letter ten
thousand artemisium mills shot their
etheric rays upon the moon and our un-
fortunate satellites metal ribs were strip-
ped by atomic force some of the great
white rays that had been one of the tele-
scopic wonders of the lunar landscapes dis-
appeared and the face of the moon which
had remained unchanged before the eyes
of the children of adam from the begin-
ning of their race now looked as if the
blast of a furnace had swept it at night
on the moonward side the earth was stud-
ded with brilliant spikes all pointing at
the heart of its child in the sky

  but the looting of the moon brought
disaster to the robber planet so mad were
the efforts to get the precious metal that
the surface of our globe was fairly show-
ered with it productive fields were in
some cases almost smothered under a
metallic coating the air was filled with
shining dust until finally famine and
pestilence joined hands with financial dis-
aster to punish the grasping world

  then at last the various governments
took effective measures to protect them-
selves and their people another combined
effort resulted in an international agree-
ment whereby the production of the pre-
cious moon metal was once more rigidly
controlled

chapter xiv

the last of dr syx

many years after the events last re-
corded i sat at the close of a bril-
liant autumn day side by side with my
old friend andrew hall on a broad vine-
shaded piazza which faced the east where
the full moon was just rising above the
rim of the sierra and replacing the rosy
counter-glow of sunset with its silvery
radiance the sight was calculated to
carry the minds of both back to the
the moon metal



events of former years but i noticed that
hall quickly changed the position of his
chair and sat down again with his back
to the rising moon he had managed to
save some millions from the wreck of his
vast fortune when artemisium started to
go to the dogs and i was now paying
him one of my annual visits at his pala-
tial home in california

  did i ever tell you of my last trip to
the teton he asked as i continued to
gaze contemplatively at the broad lunar
disk which slowly detached itself from
the horizon and began to swim in the
clear evening sky

no i replied but id like to hear
or of my last sight of dr syx
indeed i did not suppose that you
ever saw him after that conference in
your mill when he had to surrender half
of the world to you

  once only i saw him again said hall
with a peculiar intonation

  it was about seven years ago i had
long felt an unconquerable desire to have
another look at the teton and the scenes
amid which so many strange events in my
life had occurred finally i decided to go
alone i can tell you it was a gloomy place
barren and deserted the railroad had
long ago been abandoned and the site of
the military camp could scarcely be recog-
nized an immense cavity showed where
dr syxs mill used to send up its plume
of black smoke

  as i stared at the gaunt form of the
teton whose beetling precipices had been
smashed and split by the great explosion
i was seized with a resistless impulse to
climb it i thought i should like to peer
off again from that pinnacle which had
once formed so fateful a watch-tower for
me

  but it took me a long time and i did
not reach the rift in the summit until just
before sundown knowing that it would be
impossible for me to descend at night i
bethought me of the inclosure of rocks
supposed to have been made by indians
on the western pinnacle and decided that
i could pass the night there

   the perpendicular buttress forming the
 easternmost and highest point of the
 tetons head would have baffled me but
 for the fact that i found a long crack
 probably an effect of the tremendous ex-
 plosion extending from bottom to top of
 the rock driving my toes and fingers
 into this rift i managed with a good deal
 of trouble and no little peril to reach the
 top as i lifted myself over the edge and
 - rose to my feet imagine my amazement
 at seeing dr syx standing within arms-
 length of me

   my breath seemed pent in my lungs
 and i could not even utter the exclama-
 tion that rose to my lips it was like meet-
 ing a ghost notwithstanding the many
 reports of his having been seen in var-
 ious parts of the world it had always
 been my conviction that he had perished
 in the explosion

   yet there he stood in the twilight for
 the sun was hidden by the time i reached
 the summit his tall form erect and his
 black eyes gleaming under the heavy brows
 as he fixed them sternly upon my face
 you know i never was given to losing my
 nerve but i am afraid i lost it on that
 occasion again and again i strove to
 speak but it was impossible to move my
 tongue so powerless seemed my lungs
 that i wondered how i could continue
 breathing

 fihe doctor remained silent but his
 j-curious smile which as you know
 was a thing of terror to most people over-
 spread his black-rimmed face and was
 broad enough to reveal the gleam of his
 teeth i felt that he was looking me
 through and through the sensation was as
 if he had transfixed me with an ice-cold
 blade there was a gleam of devilish
 pleasure in his eyes as though my evident
 suffering was a delight to him and a grati-
 fication of his vengeance at length i suc-
 ceeded in overcoming the feeling which
 oppressed me and making a step for-
 ward i shouted in a strained voice
 you black satan

   i cannot clearly explain the psycho-


famous fantastic mysteries

 logical process which led me to utter
 those words i had never entertained any
 enmity toward dr syx although i had
 always regarded him as a heartless per-
 son who had purposely led thousands to
 their ruin for his selfish gain but i knew
 that he could not help hating me and i
 felt now that in some inexplicable man-
 ner a struggle not physical but spiritual
 was taking place between us and my ex-
 clamation uttered with surprising intens-
 ity produced upon me and apparently
 upon him the effect of a desperate sword
 thrust which attains its mark

  immediately the doctors form seemed
to recede as if he had passed the verge
of the precipice behind him at the same
time it became dim and then dimmer un-
til only the dark outlines and particularly
the jet-black eyes glaring fiercely re-
mained visible and still he receded as
though floating in the air which was
now silvered with the evening light until

he appeared to cross the immense at-
mospheric gulf over jacksons hole and
paused on the rim of the horizon iff the

east

  then suddenly i became aware that
the full moon had risen at the very place
on the distant mountain-brow where the
specter rested and as i continued to gaze
as if entranced the face and figure of the
doctor seemed slowly to frame themselves
within the lunar disk until at last he
appeared to have quitted the air and the
earth and to be frowning at me from the
circle of the moon

  while hall was pronouncing his closing
words i had begun to stare at the moon
with swiftly increasing interest until as
his voice stopped i exclaimed

  why there he is now funny i never
noticed it before theres dr syxs face
in the moon now as plain as day
yes replied hall without turning
round and i never like to look at it

the man with the

glass heart

by george allan england

        author of darkness and dawn the flying legion etc

the one man who could mend that heart wouldnt believe in it

we had just lost our routine
bridge game in the smoking room
of the ferrania-my traveling
companion maynard and i-and had set
up the nightly beers for harrison and dr
carmichael our victors tobacco there-
after appeared

  the bright electric lighting the leather
divans and nicotin-scented warmth con-
trasting cheerfully with the january blus-
ter of mid-atlantic inclined our hearts to
narration all four of us settled down for
a good gam men never talk so well i
think as when the gale is picking at the
harp of the rig the woodwork straining
and the surges slewing thunderously long-
side in the dark

  thus we spoke of many subjects and
the talk veered at last to the power of
mind over matter dr carmichael was
most interesting and as i recall it his
tale ran somewhat like this

hardly had the intruder opened the
door and quietly stepped into the
laboratory when ackroyd glanced round
with surprised vexation for the master
mind of electrical science hated interrup-
tion above all things he failed to under-
stand how this tall stern-featured man
so ominously intense had managed to slip
past the laboratory guard

  so standing up quickly beside the lit-
tered experiment bench that ran along the
whole north wall of the room the wizard
crossed his shirt-sleeved arms clamped his
teeth still tighter on the old cob which
was his constant solace and from beneath
frowning brows peered with hostility at
the newcomer

  for a moment neither spoke by the
light which glowed greenly from the
vacuum-tubes about the ceiling of this
windowless den each studied the other
then the stranger closed the door and
came forward

  please excuse this rudeness said he
in a deep courteous voice which never-
theless trembled a bit i know how very
unwelcome i must be still i am here i
had to come

  how the deuce did you get in
snapped the scientist

  oh just a little strategy nothing
simpler but lets waste no time on that
ive something far more vital to discuss
and every moments precious now i-
i-

  he stammered with sudden emotion
ackroyd perceived that he was holding
unto himself only by a strong effort re-
moving the pipe from between his teeth
the scientist stared in wonder trying to
determine what sort of fellow this might
be a professional man to be sure maybe
a writer ah perhaps he wanted an in-
terview

  sorry blurted ackroyd but if you
want to write me up or anything of that
sort i cant see you nothing to say posi-
tively nothing and he moved to sit down
at his work-bench

  the stranger raised an imploring hand
ackroyd noted how long and fine the
fingers were-white supple and adorned
by a single plain gold ring

  pardon me again said the intruder
you mistake my errand tt isnt an in-
terview i want why i never wrote a
line for publication in my life i want just

a munsey co

famous fantastic mysteries

a few minutes of your time at your own
price my errand concerns something far
more vital than mere curiosity its life
or death to me for heavens sake will
you hear me

  ackroyd startled yet intensely an-
noyed thrust out his lower lip and began
pulling at it-a way he had when partic-
ularly irritated time for him had no
price that could be counted in money

  just now he was three-quarters through
an abstruse calculation this interruption
of his mental process was an outrage
from his point of view-more a crime
any appeal to his emotions must be fruit-
less for emotions he had none the cry
of sentiment curdled his soul he hated it
so with raised palm he motioned dismis-
sal

  cant see you he decided good
day

  the stranger paling clenched both fists
  you must cried he

  so sneered the wizard thats a
new word to me

  he reached quickly for a push-button
close beside his chair

  but the stranger with a sudden gesture
tore open coat and waistcoat ripped his
shirt apart and on his naked breast ex-
posed a singular object

  ackroyd his eyes narrowing slightly
stood still his finger did not press the
little ivory knob

  thus for a second the two men con-
fronted each other

  well cried the scientist at length
what is it

  listen if you send me away without
hearing me replied the intruder in eager
haste youll miss the greatest-

  oh so youre another crank eh
sneered ackroyd with a cynical grimace
 greatest scientific marvel of the age
and all that sort of stuff eh thats what
they all say-such of em as i cant dodge
why we turn away on the average five
or six greatest marvels a day so i tell
you to begin with-

  ive got a glass heart cried the
stranger will you listen to me now

for a moment ackroyd stood dumb
then a-what he exclaimed
as he spoke the idea madman crossed
his brain but even so in spite of himself
he was startled you mean to say-

  i do i repeat it my hearts made of
glass an artificial heart mechanical auto-
matic made by kohler of vienna put in
by klugermann of bonn and operated
by this he tapped the boxlike affair
strapped to his chest do you want
proofs ive got them only listen i tell
you you can at least do that as a man
of science youre willing at least to hear
what other men have done arent you
ackroyd replied nothing but stood
studying this singular individual he noted
the high somewhat wrinkled forehead
the stiff black hair already retreating be-
fore the attack of baldness the aquiline
nose and sharp intelligent eyes then
with a smile he jibed

  not dangerous or violent are you
merely harmless i take it because you
see thats important i may as well tell
you right now that ive got a gun in the
table drawer and i can hit a dime nine
shots out of ten at a hundred feet also
there are-well other devices in this labor-
atory which might embarrass you in case
you tried to start anything so go slow
with an expression of intense chagrin
the stranger drew from his pocket a neatly
folded journal

  you read german of course asked
he ignoring the insult

  ackroyd nodded

  very well look at this

  the scientist bitterly scornful accepted
the paper he glanced over a page or two
a one-column article was blue-penciled
as he read the headlines his face became
a study

new triumph of modern surgery
radical cure of valvular degeneration
by klugermanns new method
larger aspects of the
russell case

  for almost the first time in his career
wholly at a loss ackroyd dropped the
the man with the glass heart



medical journal on his table sat down
heavily and leaning forward with a hard
stern look at this astonishing visitor de-
manded 

  well for heavens sake man what
is it all about what do you want of me
im russell to begin with answered
the other francis h russell of toledo
and as i said at first i want just a few
minutes of your time

  all right all right go ahead the
scientist exclaimed his voice betraying
more emotion than in years lets have
it

  at your own price

price what do i want of money
its useful at times allow me and
russell taking from an inner pocket of
his disordered clothing a morocco wallet
extracted therefrom a flat stack of bills

 he laid the money on the table
ackroyd glancing involuntarily at it saw
that it must total several thousand dol-
lars he started to sweep it into the waste-
basket but with a sudden change of mind
dropped it into the drawer

 new laboratories he remarked
well

  the client drew up a plain wooden chair
and sat down ackroyd noted that he
seemed in pain rather short of breath
and rather pale but to this he gave no
heed his whole thought now was of the
incomprehensible problem before him

  what to think he knew not whether
to believe or doubt he cduld not tell he
waited his eyes fixed themselves upon
that curious flat box wrhich partly showed
through the mans torn clothing russell
noted the look

  this said he more calmly is what
i came to consult you about-this ap-
paratus here he tapped the box ive
got to consult you about it knowing the
futility of trying to make any appoint-
ment by letter i did the next best thing
-waited my chance and forced myself
on you forgive me a man will do any-
thing almost even the most distasteful
things to save his life

 you mean-

  im in great danger deadly peril and
only you can save me

 how so

  ill tell you presently just a few
words first who i am doesnt matter an
american rich with children and big
business interests only fifty-two much
to live for years and years of usefulness
still ahead of me if you help me

 yes yes go on and ackroyd
whom not even the keenest interest could
long divorce from his tobacco reached
once more for the old pipe

  four years ago this spring i devel-
oped heart-disease had the best special-
ists-oh a dozen of them no results
the dishonest ones exploited me the
others told me the truth-no hope the
most optimistic gave me perhaps three
years or so to live

  well i took my death sentence and
tried to bear it as best i could and for
a while things went on getting worse and
worse all the time no matter about de-
tails i was slowly dying thats enough
to know

  wilhout comment the scientist lis-
tened his pipe was going now already
the air about his head was beginning to
grow blue

  what was it providence or mere co-
incidence that put crawfords witch of
prague into my hands about eighteen
months ago i cant say at any rate i
read the book remember key or k ara-
bans experiments one was the keynote
of my inspiration when i read that-
go on tell me about it

  he describes you recall substituting
a glass heart for the real one in a rabbit
the words branded themselves instantly
into my brain theyre all there still 
made  says he an artificial heart which
worked on a narcotized rabbit and the
rabbit died instantly when i stopped the
machine  if one applied it to a man
he might live on indefinitely grow fat and
flourish so long as the glass heart worked
where would his soul be then in the glass
heart which would have become the seat
of life 


famous fantastic mysteries

  russell paused unduly excited for a
moment ackroyd peered at him then said
he

  so you went to work on that idea did
you and at great expense of travel pain
and money had this thing actually done to
you is that omitting all minor points
what youre coming at

  exactly how splendidly you grasp
conclusions 

  i have to in this business or quit
well then what do you ask me to be-
lieve that youve actually got a mechani-
cal heart inside there in place of the old
one and that thats all you keep alive
on

  russell smiled-an odd bitter smile
im not asking you to believe any-
thing he returned im merely asking
you to examine the evidence and judge it
as you would in any other problem after
that when youre quite convinced i want
your help

  how so whats wrong

  the mechanism nobody on this side
of the atlantic can set it right except you
theres no time for a journey back to
vienna youre the only man that can save
me if you refuse-

  you die

  like keyork arabans rabbit as-
sented russell with quivering lips

ackroyd sat frowning for a mo-
ment keen thinker and clever an-
alyst though he was this case for a little
while seemed to baffle him how explain

it if the man were only a deluded crank
how account for the article in the german

magazine

  the story he told after all was not
impossible though no surgeon ackroyd
knew something of the marvels of modern
medical science-the ingrafting of organs
and of bones upon the living body the
stitching up of the wounded yet still
pulsing heart the seeming restoration of
life by various processes

  might it not be true and if so how
strangely curious a thing to know about
a flash of keen interest passed through
his mind he must have proofs-then he
would undertake whatever work this
stranger wanted done but first of all
proof positive that the thing was as the
man declared

  as though reading his thoughts russell
tapped the flat boxlike thing upon his
breast

  here said he more calmly is the
apparatus i want you to examine and re-
pair put your ear over this way-so-
now hear it something wrong you per-
ceive and youre the only man in america
i dare even show it to

  ackroyd all attention listened hard
from within the box which was shallow
and curved to fit the contour of the mans
chest came a slow rhythmic sound dull
and almost inaudible but broken now and
then by a slight hitch as though some
delicate cog or gear had stuck then gone
free again the jzard frowned

  if what youre telling me is true
the man with the glass heart



judged he youd better go to a watch-
maker im not the man you want to con-
sult at all

  pardon me returned the other but
it isnt a matter of mere clockwork here
let me explain

  taking up a pencil from the work-
bench he hastily and with considerable
skill drew out a sketch of the apparatus
a strap round the body and two over the
shoulders seemed to hold it in place
within the space which represented the
box itself he quickly limned two induction
coils a u magnet and a variety of deli-
cate levers and springs which served to
make and break a circuit from six flat
storage-batteries inside his coat

  these batteries he showed to ackroyd
now you readily understand he
elucidated my heart cant be operated
by direct transmission of power from out-
side magnetism is the only force that can
do it through the body itself

  the valves of this artificial organ are
fitted with disks of steel capable of being
attracted and released by the coils here
at x and y my batteries according
to directions i have renewed at regular
intervals of one week-two batteries each
time thus always insuring a steady uni-
form current

  but in spite of all this for ten days
past somethings been wrong the mech-
anisms been out of order it skipped a
few times once i thought it was going
to stop altogether you can imagine my
state of mind

  well interrogated the scientist
reaching for another match so then you
made up your mind to consult me

  just that and made a record run of
it too from toledo fancy your own life
utterly dependent on-

  yes yes i know but what am  to
do open that box study out the ap-
paratus see whats wrong and make it
right is that your program

  to a tm replied the client now
visibly excited

  a little color had crept into his face
his hands were working nervously

  precisely and the quicker the better
he glanced toward the door suppose we
should be interrupted i might lose my-

ome now calm yourself ackroyd
exclaimed all i ask is to be quite
convinced of the reality of this thing then
ill go ahead to the best of my ability

  turning toward the work-bench he
opened the drawer and began pawing over
the disorder to find a small screw-driver
such as he would need in opening the long
flat box

  convinced queried russell in a
strange tone how

  well just show me the scar of the
operation for one thing then let me listen
to your cardiac sounds if they turn out
to be as you claim purely mechanical
ill accept that evidence and go ahead
isnt that fair and still looking for the
screw-driver he bent over the open drawer

  isnt that reasonable repeated ack-
royd but his question was never an-
swered for voices sounded all at once
outside the laboratory then footsteps
crunched the gravel

  russell stood up suddenly clutching at
the box upon his breast ackroyd sens-
ing rather than getting vision of the mans
quick rage and terror whirled round just
in time to see him whip an automatic
revolver from his pocket

  outside a trilling whistle sounded steps
clumped on the broad wooden piazza

  russell livid and trembling with sud-
den passion thrust his head forward with
bowed shoulders and disordered dress re-
volver balanced in his hand he crept with
stealthy tread toward the door the
grotesque quality of his figure contrasted
horribly with its bestial tigerish murder-
ous alertness

  horrified ackroyd stood inert the very
suddenness of the transformation numbed
him for a second at the table he re-
mained staring with wide eyes his jaw
gaping not yet able to understand but
foreseeing violence

  came a decisive voice i guess hes in
there all right enough

  another answered well have him in
a minute now but be careful here bray
you keep back now all right

  but before the door swung open rus-
sell whirled on ackroyd as the wizard
sprang

  you hound he shrieked jerking the
revolver to position you did this you
warned those fiends youre in this in-
fernal conspiracy too to break my glass
heart and destroy my soul but i wont
die alone the mans face was black with
rage and foam had gathered at the cor-
ners of his mouth

  die he yelled but as the revolver
barked ackroyd ducked and swinging his
chair aloft hurled it full at russell

  it struck him squarely on the breast
and shoulder his revolver spat again as
he fell the bullet shattered the vacuum-
tube overhead glass jangled the light
faded darkness fell ackroyd flung him-
self upon the man

  in burst the door and by the glare of
day through the opening the rescuers saw
ackroyd slowly getting up with a dazed
half frightened air puzzled for a moment
they held back

  whats-whats up cried a voice
ackroyd heard the snick of a revolver
hammer

 wait he panted he found and
pressed a button instantly a flood of yel-
low light inundated the laboratory from
the reserve incandescents

  by this light they saw russell lying
distorted motionless upon the floor his
eyes were open and staring-the hideous
eyes of a man who has died in the grip
of stark mad terror

  he-did he tell you- began one of
the men they wore blue uniforms and
caps tell you he had a glass heart
want you to repair it for him

  ackroyd did not answer he merely
snatched up the big sheet he used to cover
his models with and spread it over the
corpse

 come get busy he commanded
take him out this is no morgue im
busy too busy for any questions until

the inquest then youll find me on hand
to make an accounting for everything he
said and did and gave me now out you
all go

  thus he dismissed them ten minutes
later with the old cob once more cheer-
fully erupting he got back to his inter-
rupted calculation unmindful of the
baffled reporters who had already begun
to pry about outside

in the smoke-room our little group
sat silent for a moment as dr car-
michael finished then harrison spoke

  just an escaped lunatic with reli-
gious mania too

  hardly that if so extremely high
grade a man of his education able to
write and print a german paper like that
just to substantiate his own hallucination
can hardly be classed as a mere lunatic
rather call it a case of acute monomania
perfectly sane in every other respect per-
fectly hopeless in that respect so firmly
convinced of it in fact that the shock of
the chair against his apparatus dropped
him stone-dead mind over matter well
rather

  another pause

  then in a satirical tone up spoke may-
nard my traveling companion and cabin-
mate

  well judged he it was no more
than he deserved for being a plain in-
fernal fool why if hed known anything
about the subject of glass hearts or arti-
ficial hearts of any kind for that matter
hed have been aware that theres only one
bona-fide case on record of such a thing
actually working so he stood a self-con-
victed faker

  one-one case hesitated the be-
wildered doctor

  only one but its got nothing to do
with all that rot about the soul residing
in it and so on furthermore its not all
glass but partly glass and partly alumi-
num and its operated not by simple
magnetism but-

  how do you know such a lot of things
that arent so snapped the doctor
the man with the glass heart



maynards face grew hard and his eyes
narrowed

why oughtnt a man to know about
his own heart he replied at length

 a dense stillness enveloped our group
 then the doctor coughed nervously got
 up and with a banal word of excuse with-
 drew down the stairway to the bar below
 harrison also departed the gale whipped
 into the room as he shoved out to the
 heaving deck behind him the door banged

 i found myself alone with maynard

the fools he laughed then he sud-
denly grew serious with a strange eager
look upon his face

he drew out pencil and note-book

coming next month

  see here he whispered as his nerv-
ous fingers began with rapid strokes to
form a diagram my heart is like this-
see ive never explained it yet to a living
soul but-this conversation tonight has
decided me if i should die the mystery
would be lost i make you my confidant
but remember if you so much as lisp a
syllable of this while t still live ill shoot
you like a dog

  then he laughed again a high-pitched
cackling laugh in which lay no merriment
and while with sudden dread  watched
h began expounding to me his chosen
victim the secret of the only successful
artificial heart now operating in the world

robinsons decision

here were three of us robinson
hendricks and myself

robinson had had a varied career
soldier policeman lawyer and several
other professions which he never divulged
but which kept continually cropping out
in his conversation

i have an idea he had been a sailor and

had sailed over all the seven seas there
was no country which he had not visited
no people nor race nor tribe of which he
knew not the characteristics nor any insti-
tution with whose history and develop-
ment he had not an intimate knowledge

  indeed it was on the historical side that
he was the most remarkable i have never
seen such a man the scope of his in-
tellect seemed to embrace everything
from the chaldeans down all was to him
an open book he appeared to know as
much about nebuchadnezzar as about me

  all the great lights of history were to
him as men living and present he would

tell of their foibles and greatness their
manners and personal appearance with as
much vividness and distinctness as if they
and not i were seated by his side for por-
trayal then he would lapse off into gib-
bering of a kind which i could not and
would not understand into tongues obso-
lete and forgotten which he chose to call
chaldaic sanscrit and what not

  again he would drift off into anecdote
and speak of an incident wherein caesar
and pompey and another character i
knew not of were the principals he knew
anecdotes by the million there seemed to
be no limit to the supply with which he
amused me from day to day nor do i ever
remember his relating the same one twice

  big and little large and small people
and kings he appeared to have them all at
his fingers ends i wondered sometimes
that he did not write history he who knew
more than all the historians put together
once i asked him but he only shrugged
his shoulders

  i have no time he laughed i am a
loafer besides i know too much were i
to tell the truth i would be called a liar

  the other man hendricks was a friend
of robinsons an attorney who had come
up to the mountains to recuperate it
seems that he and robinson had just been
through some terrible ordeal which had
played havoc with them both mentally
and physically

  he had not the wonderfully retentive
memory of his friend nor his marvelous
command of language though he did ap-
pear to have a fair smattering of the law
and a very fair education most of the
time he spent as i did in loitering about
and in listening to the everlasting elo-
quence of robinson

  as for myself i was purely passive

  it was our custom to come out on the
veranda at night and to discuss books un-
der the fragrance of a good cigar

  i had on this day been reading a novel
of the very cheap and sensational order
one that bad to do with a plot of the
purely imaginative type wherein the char-
acters were taken out of the life of or-

dinary reality and transplanted into the
realm of the grotesque and the terrible

  i held that all works of true literary
merit should contain as a basic feature
the elements of real life and that in their
ramifications they should hold by all means
to life as it is and to avoid transgressing
the regions of the impossible for the
work at hand i had but little use and i
criticized it severely as a thing absurd and
ridiculous

  it was moonlight and for some mo-
ments after i had finished my tirade we
sat watching the shadows among the hills
robinson was usually loquacious but to-
night he was strangely quiet undoubtedly
he was thinking he scarcely noticed my
talk at all but sat there working his cigar
at both ends chewing and smoking dream-
ing and apparently in the land of far
away until the moon passing behind a
cloud and the flood of mellow light ceas-
ing he turned to his friend

hendricks he said how long has
it been since i escaped from that beast
third of january and this is the third
of may answered hendricks exactly
four months why

  oh nothing much only our friend here
is skeptical and believes only in the com-
monplace he is like all the rest of man-
kind only i think we can cure him i pro-
pose that we relate to him our own ex-
perience and prove to him how one man
managed to live for ten thousand years in
the enjoyment of youth and vigor and how
i came to be devoured alive and how it
happens that i am living tonight to tell
the tale

  tell him if you wish answered hen-
dricks ill corroborate you as long as
you stick by the truth

  robinson moved his chair closer to mine
and sat so that i could get a full and a
perfect view of his whole person

  do you see any marks on me he be-
gan any tooth marks or anything like
that no yet would you believe me were
i to tell you that i have been devoured
alive not only that but digested and
enjoyed


famous fantastic mysteries

  i certainly would not i answered

  of course not he replied and really
i dont much blame you time was and
not so many years ago at that when i
would have said the same thing neverthe-
less what i am about to tell you is
the gospel truth as you will learn from
my friend hendricks

  and robinson plunged instantly into
the following story

about six years ago after some time
spent in the islands i returned in a
practically penniless state to san fran-
cisco besides my baggage and wearing
apparel i could not have possessed much
more than forty dollars

  one day after i had tramped over a
great portion of the city climbing sky-
scrapers invading factories and i know
not what in my never-ceasing search for
employment i struck a crowd surging up
montgomery and like a chip in the tide
drifted along with it

  in my despair and half-heartedness i
little dreamed of the strange and marvelous
existence of which i was soon to become
a part of an existence which was to re-
ward me with a learning which i think has
never before been attained by mortal man
and a wealth of such proportions that the
human mind can scarce conceive of its
vastness

  both sides of the street on which i
walked were lined by office buildings on
whose serried windows were hung painted
and gilded the signs and placards of
numerous lawyers doctors corporations
and insurance companies among them my
attention was attracted to a particular at-
torneys sign whose reading in gold let-
ters had on me a strange and gladdening
effect it read

w e hendricks
attorney at law

  i had known a w e hendricks before
going to the islands we had been class-
mates and roommates while at college and

i remembered now with a flash of eager
hope that it had always been his desire
to build up a practice in some western
state preferably in california i can hardly
tell you how happy and excited that hope
made me

a moment later i was in the office
all trembling with eagerness over the
voice which came from the adjoining room
sure enough it was hendricks-bill hen-
dricks the one man whom above all others
under my present indigent circumstances
i would have chosen to meet

  naturally i moved my belongings to the
quarters of hendricks where under the
spur of poverty  lived on his bounty
while seeking employment

  one morning about a month later i en-
tered the office and found hendricks as
usual deep in the intricacies of his pro-
fession scattered over and about his desk
were his everlasting law books legal pa-
pers and documents an evening paper and
to one side an early edition of the san
francisco mercury which without look-
ing up he passed over to me for perusal

  you will find he said an advertise-
ment in the help-wanted column which it
may be to your advantage to look up
the advertisement was marked with a
blue pencil and i had but little trouble in
locating it it was for a companion and
i must say it was the most peculiar ad-
vertisement of its kind that i had ever
read it was worded something like this

   wanted-a companion for an elderly
  gentleman applicant must be about twenty-
  six years of age exactly five feet eleven
  inches in height and must weigh between
  one hundred and eighty and eighty-five
  pounds he must possess a small knowledge
  of the law also he must be a good con-
  versationalist and be able to give proofs as
  to his perfect health and vigor no ap-
  plicant with any symptom of disease or any
  infirmity whatsoever will be considered
  anyone answering these qualifications can
  procure immediate and lucrative employ-
  ment by calling et cetera

  the address of a dr runson on rubic
avenue followed
almost immortal



  strange to say although the conditions
were so peculiar and various and so im-
possible of filling for the ordinary man
they fitted me to a nicety

  it was almost as if i had received a spe-
cial order to report for duty i was exactly
five feet eleven inches in height and had
weighed only the day before one hundred
and eighty-three pounds so that i had a
leeway of two pounds in one direction and
three in the other besides i possessed a
college education and knew considerable
about the law if i had any weakness or
infirmity of any kind i had not as yet
noticed it on top of this i was a very
fair conversationalist at least t had al-
ways been considered so by my friends

  the position seemed made for me and
i decided to apply for it immediately

chapter ii

dr runson

an hour later i had made my way to
rubic avenue where i found the
rendezvous to be a most comfortable old
two-story house with large deep easy-
looking verandas a splendid lawn and
green-shuttered windows

  in response to my knock a neat little
woman of some fifty summers-or rather
winters for the quiet troubled look of her
face and the gray of her hair reminded
one more of that season than any other
-appeared at the door

  she was trim and neat and apparently
expecting me for she quietly opened the
door and bade me in a kind motherly
voice which i noticed at once to enter
and without another word pressed a but-
ton beside her and disappeared leaving
me in the hall alone and waiting in an-
other moment a door opened above and a
voice came down the stairs-a musical
voice but masculine and full of vigor

  is that you mr robinson just step
up this way please

  naturally i had expected to meet a
stranger and was not a little surprised at
hearing the sound of my own name spoken
from above

  it is i answered and i remember
wondering how in the world he could know
it and who in the world he could be

  i am glad to see you mr robinson
he greeted me when i reached the landing
exceedingly glad i was expecting you
step right in

  he opened the door and led me into a
study or rather a sitting-room or still
better a combination of the two

  sit down and we will talk business he
said

  a total stranger i was sure i had never
seen him before of my own height but
sixty hair turned gray of my own fea-
tures and might have been my twin
brother but for thirty years or so hands
white and immaculate slender and deft
like a gamblers neat dressed in black
clean shaved and a gentleman

  all this i took in at a glance as you
would take in a photograph nothing un-
common nothing extraordinary every-
thing barring the resemblance to myself
which i might have had perfect reason
to expect then our eyes met

  someone has said that the eyes are the
gateway to the soul this was an arch-
way the idea of the common vanished
and in its place was the extraordinary the
magnificent i will condense it all by my
own flash of feeling-the eyes of a mul-
titude

  you could not look into his eyes without
the feeling instinctive but always present
that you were not looking into those of
one man but the eyes of a thousand
however it was not an unpleasant feel-
ing more of strength of power the im-
pression of an indomitable will which not
all the world could change nevertheless
they were pleasant with a kindness and a
jovialty which danced and fascinated you

  now mr robinson he began when
we were seated let us proceed i shall
talk first for it is my nature i am al-
ways first you will be surprised at what
i tell you but do not wonder at that as
i am  will admit an extraordinary char-
acter though you will most likely find me
common enough for a few months


famous fantastic mysteries

  now i decided yesterday to advertise
for a companion and in looking over the
available candidates i found you the most
desirable  knew you could easily be
reached through the papers therefore the
advertisement your name is john robin-
son you are twenty-six years of age
your height is five feet eleven inches you
weighed yesterday one hundred and eighty-
three pounds you have a smattering of
the law and a splendid education you have
a will of your own and are handsome you
are a good conversationalist and enjoy the
most perfect health you have traveled and
have but lately returned from the islands
you have but vefy little money almost
broke in fact and you need work is not
all this true

  most true doctor i returned i had
no idea you knew me or perhaps-hen-
dricks

  no he broke in neither i never
dreamed of your existence until yesterday
didnt know hendricks was living further-
more just for the fun of it when you
dressed this morning you were minus one
sock and did not find it until after you
had searched for it for fully ten minutes
i laughed for he was telling the truth
though how he came to know i couldnt
make out

  you surely have got me unless you are
another sherlock holmes and a past-master
of deduction

  the doctor raised his hands imploringly
please dont he said please dont not
that its too puerile too common i have
read sherlock and admire the work but
i am i hope far above that i have pow-
ers mr robinson t will admit but i
am no detective i never use deduction
leave that to the mortals

  as he spoke he drew himself up in a
proud isolated sort of way and t could
not help but admire him though his man-
ner was mystic and his words to me rather
confusing

  that is very good flesh sir very good
flesh he stepped over to my side and to
my wonderment began pinching my arm
severely i dont know why but i drew

away with much the same feeling as a
fat chicker might have and was not a
little angr

  it is i answered reddening per-
haps i had better be going

  oh no mr robinson not at all
please dont be offended i meant no harm
i was just wondering how it seemed to be
young you are so vigorous and so full of
life that i envied you but i meant no
harm sir i assure you i meant no harm

   sat down again and accepted his
apology

  and about this position i asked
you know that is the object of my
visit

  to be sure said the doctor to be
sure well let me see how would twenty
dollars and your board and room sound

  sounds all right i replied de-
pending though a great deal on how i
earn it

  the old mans eyes twinkled and he
smiled you will earn it sii by doing
nothing absolutely nothing

  rather easy i answered but there
must be something for me to do even
sleep is work when you are paid for it
and youve got it to do whether or no

  to be sure to be sure well well
amend that there will be work and it will
consist in playing cards reading and con-
versation you see im lonely im get-
ting old i need a companion and intend
to have one i am wealthy and can afford
it its merely a whim sir merely a
whim

  he took an eraser from the table and
began tossing it in his hand

  it all looked good to me he was a char-
acter beyond doubt and his personality
attracted me i foresaw that i would en-
joy myself in his company here was
someone to observe someone to study and
perhaps a little risk he was a man with
some power unknown perhaps and might
bear watching that however was an at-
traction rather than an obstacle i would
have had it just so therefore we quickly
came to an understanding and i agreed
to remain

chapter iii

the case-of allen doreen

my position turned out to be an
excellent one there was practically
no work merely to listen to the old gen-
tleman a task which i found not only
interesting but agreeable in the morning
usually between seven and eight we had
breakfast after which we read and dis-
cussed the newspapers about ten we would
go for a short walk and make a few pur-
chases until noon when we had lunch

  from that time until three my time
was my own while the doctor retired to
his laboratory or sanctum into which i
was never invited and none was allowed
to go this was something easily accounted
for i figured that anyone who would will-
ingly devote his life to disease drugs and
chemicals had all the license in the world
to be queer and particular in his habits
and let it go at that

  about three the doctor reappeared tired
and nervous and ready for a game of
cards always at this time of day i no-
ticed a hungry longing look in his eyes
but this i took to be merely the effect of
some strain on his mind some scientific
fact sought for but not attained and in no
way connected it with myself from three
until dark it was the same thing day after
day cards conversation and reading
rather a snap dont you think

  so the days went by one after an-
other each week my check was in hand
and each week my savings mounted higher

  one day during a walk the doctor and
i ran across hendricks of course i had
to introduce them the doctor seemed
pleased to meet him and he to meet the
doctor

  i noticed when they shook hands that
they gazed squarely into each others eyes
and laughed they seemed to see clear
through each other and to take pleasure
in the accomplishment just before we
separated hendricks took me by the arm

  rob he said can you come down
to the office i must see you

certainly i answered this after-

noon if you like whats it about hen
the doctor had been studying a window
display but just then he happened to
turn and once again he and hendricks
gazed full into each others eyes and once
again they laughed

  well snapped hendricks heres
my car i must be going glad to have
met you doctor so long rob

  and a moment later from the platform
of the car he shouted back through his
hands important

  we stood for some moments on the curb
watching the car jolting down the street
until the fog settling in we were left
alone in the blanket of mist gloomy and
silent somehow i felt like the weather
cold and monotonous and dreary my life
was without sunshine

  that man said the doctor at length
is dangerous

  what man i snapped turning sud-
denly on him he started and eyed me
curiously

  why that man of course the one
we just left hendricks of course what
other could i mean

  now i liked the old man immensely
but i could and would not stand there
and see him abuse my friend

  look here doctor you may be a
learned man all right and all that and you
may know a good many things unknown
to the rest of us poor mortals but that
wont help you one whit when it comes
to judging men i have known hendricks
practically all my life and i know him
almost as well as myself he is honest and
fearless and the best friend that ever trod
on two feet i will not hear a word against
him

  my companion smiled good naturedly
whom are you working for mr rob-
inson

  for you

  whose money are you drawing
  yours

  well then i want you to have nothing
to do with hendricks hes too analytical
too dangerous i want you to leave him
alone


famous fantastic mysteries

  i was going to answer him with heat
but just then our eyes met and i subsided
for the life of me i could not tell why
but a complete change came over me i
instinctively felt that the doctor was right
and i was wrong

  lunch was ready when we reached the
house and after the meal the doctor as
usual disappeared in his sanctum left to
my own resources i began to come to
myself

  pish i exclaimed ill go see hen-
dricks

  in the hall i met the housekeeper she
was dusting some furniture i had just
placed my hand on the door knob when
she touched me gently on the shoulder

  mr robinson

  i noticed that her voice was low and
cautious with a sort of appeal in it

  well what is it

  she lifted her kind old face to mine
her eyes full of tenderness and entreaty
and i thought of pity

  dont you think you had better go
away and stay its getting to be that
time of the year you dont know what
you are doing or where you are going i
have been watching the doctor i am sure
the time is at hand you are young you
are handsome full of life and strength
oh it is not fit to be so do say that
you will go

  she seized the lapels of my coat in her
hands and looked up into my face

  do say it she repeated he would
kill me if he knew i had warned you

  just then a door creaked or a window
was lowered i know not what exactly
the woman drew back her whole form
rigid with fear we both listened for
a moment we stood like two silent statues
alert but hearing nothing

  pshaw i said at length it is noth-
ing now mother what is the trouble

  the sound of my voice restored her and
a little color came to her face

  go she said and be sure to re-
member what i have told you

  with that a door opened and she dis-
appeared as for myself i put on my hat

  and started for town a half hour later i
was in hendricks office

ell rob he said lighting a
cigar you got here do you know
i would have wagered a good five-dollar
bill against a single unroasted peanut
that you would never have made it and
im mighty glad you are stronger than
i thought i suppose you know what you
are up against

  now this was a line of talk for which

i	was scarcely prepared especially from
hendricks of course i was some worked
up after the little scene with the house-
keeper but i hardly expected to find
my friend in the same humor

  oh say i cut in are you and the
old lady in cahoots do you want me
to lose a good thing whats the mat-
ter

  he thought a while went to the window
and watched the traffic in the street pres-
ently he turned about and in his slow
earnest way began to talk

  look here rob the gentleman to
whom i was introduced today has in-
terested me more than any person i have
ever met he is a character i have dreamed
about i have often pictured myself meet-
ing an individual of this species i must
say it pleases me though i am sorry to
find you in his company i intend to give
you fair warning i shall tell you what
he is and you can direct your future
actions accordingly but first i want you
to tell me all you know about him and
what has transpired since you have taken
up your position go ahead

  kind of a poser wasnt it

  but i had confidence in hendricks of
all the persons i had ever met he was
the last to take a dramatic posture i
knew him for a deep water man a man
of deep thoughts and few words but when
the words did come they were like chips of
steel sharp and to the point therefore i
opened my heart fully i related to hen-
dricks all that i knew also i told him
of the old ladys actions and the scene
in the hallway
almost immortal



when i had finished he smiled and
began drubbing the desk with his
fingers

  and what do you make of it he
asked

  i threw up my hands

  youve got me hendricks theres a
rat in a hole somewhere but i am not
cat enough to see it

  well he answered i am the mans
a ghoul ever hear of a vampire

  on the stage

  yes and off not the thrilling entranc-
ing kind that lulls you with a scene of
love and beauty and soothingly imbibes
while you are in a dream of the seventh
heaven but the real stern genuine reality
the kind that measures and weighs every
movement of its victim the kind that
watches with the pulsating eyes of a cat
every play of the muscles every flash of
emotion until secure of its prey and sure
of the moment it feeds its greed with
the blood of its fellow

  pleasant prospect surely i an-
swered

  do you still wish to retain your job
why old boy if that old duffer made
an offer to harm me id strangle him
with my thumb and little finger

  youd do nothing of the sort that old
man has mind your strength and muscle
dont amount to a row of shucks when
the time comes he snapped his fingers
therell be no jack robinson

  i suppose he will make a sort of salad
of me or serve me up as a soup i
put in

  hardly that listen rob did you
ever hear of allen doreen

  the man who walked into a london
cottage and disappeared from the face of
the earth even though the place was sur-
rounded by watchers ive heard of him
surely and i believe the story a lie
well i dont snapped hendricks
the man who had charge of those watch-
ers was my own father he was allen
doreens best friend furthermore when
doreen entered that house there was a
man sitting in plain view of the watchers

and that man was the exact counterpart
of your doctor friend in half an hour they
had both disappeared

  when they broke open the house it
was searched from cellar to attic and from
attic to cellar back again but neither skin
nor teeth nor hair was found of either the
place was completely surrounded yet no
one was seen leaving the house it was as
if they had dissolved in air so completely
was it done that was the last ever seen
of allen doreen my father worked on the
case for years the police of london never
quite gave it up yet it is a mystery today
-no evidence whatever no sign no clue
perhaps said i a secret passage
the place was torn down three weeks
afterward hendricks returned the foun-
dations were torn up for a larger building
such a thing would have been found there
was none

  well i yawned youve got me any-
how ill hold my job its the most excit-
ing way of doing nothing ive yet found
besides ive started on the serial and
im going to see the next chapter
hendricks took a fresh cigar

  well that settles it rob youre the
same old daredevil nothing can frighten
you not even a real genuine live bogey
man and im glad of it well see the
thing through between you and me i
think well catch the fox and know his
game likewise therell be a solution of
allen doreen

  so far your cases are parallel soft
snap nothing to do pleasant doctor ad-
vertisement height weight and measure-
ment all agree all weve got to do is
change the results thats up to us now
im going to show you something

  from a drawer in his desk he drew
out a small old-fashioned case which he
unsnapped and passed over to me it con-
tained a photograph

  perhaps said he you have seen
someone who looks like that

  i took the picture and held it to the
light it was the doctor

  looks like it doesnt it asked my
friend and perhaps it is that is the


famous fantastic mysteries

man who did away with allen doreen
i am the exact image of my father he
recognized me at once now you see why
we laughed in each others faces it was
a challenge mine was a laugh of triumph
his of derision and contempt we shall
see who is the fox and now to get down
to business what is it that you propose
to do

  well said  i see nothing else to do
but to return to my work and if anything
unusual or threatening occurs-why im
the very little boy who will put a stop
to it

  im glad hendricks smiled that you
are so confident however i am going to
take a few precautions or rather i have
already taken them your house is even
now under surveillance there are three de-
tectives of my own hiring on the watch
one each in the houses adjoining and one
in the house across the street they know
fully what an important case they are on
and are aware of the consequent glory if
they are successful

  they are the shiftiest nerviest and
cleverest of the force and understand per-
fectly with what a wise old fox they are
dealing

  now if anything very unusual should
happen and you wish to notify the out-
side world all you have to do it to place
a piece of paper in a window where it
may be seen and if you need help two
-one in each end of the window myself
i shall keep hidden the old fox is onto
me and consequently i shall keep out of
sight until such time as i am needed when
i will be there

  all right hendricks i said ill do
as you say but really after all i dont
believe the old doc is as bad as you say
there must be some mistake i have an
idea it will all come out right and the
only thing to result will be a little foolish
feeling for ourselves

  there was an embarrassed pause

  as you will rob shrugged hen-
dricks only i wish to take no chances
you have a perfect right to your own
opinion

     chapter iv

mrs green makes an effort

ack again

  it was the doctor he met me at the
door a smile on his face and his hand
extended he was in his best humor

  yes said i removing my hat i had
a little business to transact and thought
it was best done before it was too late
thats good returned the doctor a
twinkle in his eye always keep your
affairs in good order everybody should
do that neglect nothing thats been my
motto always and at all times we know
so little of what is going to happen

  at that moment i would have given i
know not what for a more definite knowl-
edge of what the next few days might have
in store

  if i was uneasy i think i carried it off
quite well and i dont think the doctor
had any suspicion in a few minutes i
was my own self and was dealing out the
cards as deftly and easily as ever i had
done

  this is a fine game said the doctor
who was winning

  splendid  returned inasmuch as i
was paid for losing splendid

  swish swish swish the cards glided
over the table-the doctors i dealt my-
self three swish swish swish-the doc-
tors clip clip clip-our hands were dealt
the first trick was the doctors and his
smile grew broader the next was mine
and the next and the next the whole
hand in fact with the turn of luck his
good humor vanished

  a rum hand he muttered gimme
something good

  however it was his own deal and he
surely treated himself well all the trumps
were his likewise the tricks his good
humor returned

  do you know my boy i always like
to win on this night this you know is
the twentieth of september the night of
all nights every twenty years it returns
he was watching the cards as they
glided toward him picking them up one
almost immortal



by one with his long tapered fingers and
talking more apparently to himself than
to me

  every twenty years  have reduced
it to a formula a science twenty years
two minutes fifty-eight seconds he drew
out his watch fifteen minutes of eight
over two hours yet two hours and over
he began playing again-silently-a
smile on his lips anticipating it was a
sort of sensual smile and i noticed an odd
look of anticipation in his eyes as he
watched the cards the tricks were all
his and he drew back entirely satisfied

  whats this doc why every twenty
years why must you win tonight ex-
periment or fact

  fact answered the doctor fact i
win for luck luck always goes with the
winner you lead

  again we went to playing but in the
intervals of play i began absently like
one merely passing time to roll a news-
paper which was lying on the table you
may think i was perturbed but i was
not at all i was merely doing what my
friend had advised-playing safe

  if i were going to see the thing through
to the end i calculated that perhaps a
little help at the climax would be a thing
most convenient of course my mind was
working hendricks had called the doctor
a vampire i had never seen one but my
imagination had pictured a thing vastly
different from this

  during the silent moments i watched
him-cool clear-eyed and kindly his every
movement an act of grace his whole man-
ner the embodiment of fascination when
he smiled the very atmosphere seemed to
ripple his clear eyes fairly danced with
mirth and you felt a sort of infinite joy in
the mere privilege of sharing their pleasure

  i had known him for many days-this
man and during all that time i had found
him nothing but kindness and considera-
tion a companion jolly at all times as
i studied him and watched him my mind
revolted at its own folly

  what a climax of things ridiculous to
classify this man with a species of moral

outcast which mankind in its loathsome
horror has refused a classification with
either man or beast can you blame me for
laying the paper back on the table i had
only folded it

the game continued the doctor win-
ning regularly and deriving an infinite
joy therefrom and i with all i had on
my mind watching him intently for ever
so small a sign that might signify or prove
him to be anything but that to which he
pretended

  the clock struck nine it came all at
once as clocks have a habit of doing
when in the silent hours a clashing that
seems to step right out of the wall seizes
you by the throat and startles you out of
your marrow we both started but the
doctor i was sure was really frightened

  he half rose in his chair seized his
watch in his left hand and stood gazing
from it to the clock in a sort of palsy
a look such as i never saw in a mortal
came into his eyes they fairly danced
and glittered and as he gazed at me be-
wildered i would have sworn that they
dissolved and that i looked not into the
eyes of one but into those of a hundred
snap the doctor closed his watch
my he sighed how that did startle
me i thought it was ten and i was too
late let us have some wine

  he reached for the bell and pressed it
energetically almost savagely

  do you know mr robinson he asked
while we were waiting do you know what
it means to me

  naturally i do not i replied you
having never told me

  well ill tell you-leaning back in
his chair-it means this in an hours
time i shall be either alive or dead if my
experiment or fact as i have called it
is a success you will see me a miracle
alive young strong handsome a being
to marvel at and admire if it should
fail you will witness the most abject and
miserable death that ever has been or ever
will be seen on this earth

  in a few moments from that time i


famous fantastic mysteries

shall begin to dwindle to tumble to strug-
gle to cry out my pleading will ring in
your ears for years to come when you
are dreaming and when you are waking
you will see my fearful image i shall be
a horror and an abomination to you in
a few moments i shall be no larger than
this inkstand and i shall be growing
smaller and smaller until at last i disap-
pear-a mere speck of nothing forever
and forever

  but you who are standing here-you
will have seen an army a strange fantom
host jabbering incoherent indistinct a
confusion of the ungodly with the godly
-a babel of conflicting tongues a strug-
gling of opposing nationalities a mael-
strom of fantom hatred with myself the
center of it all reviled execrated loathed
and despised their curses will ring in
your ears for a lifetime

  i will stand here alone they will van-
ish one by one they will step into a grave
of shadows and disappear and you will
be left alone with nothing but a prob-
lem the solution of which will baffle not
only you but your friends and assistants
for all time

  he was quite cool now and i could
see that he was perfectly sane although
my firm faith in his manhood-the good
old gentleman kind-began to flicker per-
ceptibly

  and it was for this i asked that you
employed me

  exactly

  you wished to make use of me
naturally for what does one man hire
another if it is not his services you will
help me in this crisis it will be a triumph
a great one for one or the other of us
in any case you will have beheld something
to witness which there are many who would
willingly pay a fortune

  the door opened and the housekeper
brought in the wine and the glasses i
bowed to her and took the occasion to
nonchalantly place the roll of paper in the
window the curtain was up and i was
fairly sure that it could be seen from
across the street my action t was sure

was not noticed for the doctor was pour-
ing out the wine while the woman was
standing alongside the table watching him

  evidently she was greatly excited for i
noticed that her hands trembled violently
while her face so calm and healthy usually
was ashy white to which her lips drawn
down at the corners as if from some load
of anguish gave that troubled and stricken
look of one standing under an impending
disaster

  mrs green-it was the doctor who
spoke-do you know the day of the
month

  it was said in a cool steady tone but
there was mockery in it indescribably an
indefinite taunting tinctured with hatred
and self-superiority

 the woman started and her hands
clenched a very storm of fury broke upon
her if the doctor had wished to goad her
to madness he had done it well and with
but a sentence anyway it seemed to please
him for he smiled sweetly while she broke
upon him

  you she shouted as she leveled her
trembling accusing finger you you liarl
you murderer you dog you know i
know and you dare ask me what day is
it what day of the month is it yes ask
when you know so well it is the twentieth
of september that it is your anniversary
your celebration of crime-of murder

  where is allen doreen down in your
black black dirty warped crime-bespat-
tered soul you are gloating over a murder
thistvery night where is allen doreen
was i not with you twenty years ago when
you murdered that poor innocent lad
and because i did not witness the actual
deed do you suppose for an instant that i
doubted your guilt

  i am your housekeeper now and i was
your housekepeer then though you little
knew it when you engaged me six months
ago why did you hire allen doreen
why did you pay him fabulous sums to
do merely nothing what became of him
what did you do with him answer me
that why have you this man here sir
she continued turning to me unless you
almost immortal



take my advice and leave this house at
once you will never see daylight again

  mrs green this is enough enough

  and before i could interfere he had
seized her by the arms and ejected her
from the room turning the key in the
door as he did so

chapter v

the vampire

he was a man of quick action and
it was done in a twinkling almost
before  could think

  but the scene had decided me

  the picture of the old woman standing
there in the lamplight her face ashen her
eyes flashing and her accusing finger speak-
ing as loudly as her tongue will ever live
in my memory

  and i can see the doctor still sitting
there with the wine-filled glasses smiling
cynically egging her on with his mocking
taunting laugh

  i would have rolled a second paper and
brought hendricks and his men thunder-
ing through the door but for a thought

 was morally sure that this man was a
murderer and i was just as certain that
he was contemplating another crime this
night with myself for the victim

  but what was the proof

  i had none only an old womans word
and that had all been before the law al-
ready i could not call hendricks yet if
i were afraid i could walk out of the
door the doctor could not stop me but
i was not afraid no there was but one
thing to do-to wait when the time came
i would throttle him with my thumb and
finger just to show hendricks and then
call in my friends

  the doctor was in an apologetic mood
though t noticed that he put the key in
his pocket not that i cared for i con-
sidered myself enough of his master to take
it away from him whenever needed only
 noticed it

  you mustnt mind her he said mrs
green is a good old soul only a little
erratic thats all he oointed to his fore-

head to signify her fault she has them
once in a while she lost a dear friend
once but the poor old soul has a haunt-
ing idea of which i can never rid her
that i was the cause of his disappearance
she has been my housekeeper for years
she is splendid let us get back to our
game

  once again we sat down sipping the
wine and playing cards the clock above
was slowly ticking toward the fatal ten and
the doctor was having all the luck i was
very curious and expectant but kept a
cool head watching every movement of my
companion

  what were his plans what his treach-
ery what his preparations i could see
none only his everlasting playing

  ife seemed superbly confident humming
a low tune and smiling as buoyantly as
a boy of twelve there was surely some-
thing in the air but try as i might i could
make nothing out of it i waited

  it was half past nine-twenty minutes
of the hour the room was hot and stuffy
and i began to feel nervous i had no
fear and having none i tried to laugh
at myself for giving way to nerves in
spite of all my efforts i felt myself slip-
ping a great lump came in my throat
which i could not down and i could hear
my heart thumping against my ribs pulsat-
ing so loudly that i was rather surprised
that the doctor did not notice it

  fifteen minutes to ten i was watching
keenly

  at your first move old man i will
strangle you i said to myself

  but the doctor did not move instead
he kept on playing calm happy and in
perfect good humor his very coolness
nettled me from dislike t was rapidly
running into hatred my hands shook with
desire for action if he were a vampire
i wanted to know it and to know it
quickly

  why this everlasting delay and these in-
fernal cards

  i was cutting when the first sign came
and i shall never forget it

  it was a sensation a feeling i wish


famous fantastic mysteries

never again to experience for the first
time  knew that  was playing with a
power behind the conception of man that
i was eating with the devil and was using
a short spoon it was like a wave my
courage vanished and my confidence was
gone when i looked up the doctor was
peering at me

  lord what eyes cavernous flaming
with the most unholy light of ages with
a cry of horror i dropped the cards

  the doctor said not a word his whole
body seemed to shrivel and become head
and that in turn to transform and disinte-
grate and to slowly reform and grow into
eyes immense and terrible two great
green fires consuming devouring un-
earthly

  what was it what was it a scream

  the eyes vanished the doctor was sit-
ting there before me yes it was a scream
a womans scream how good it seemed a
door slammed across the street there was
a scurrying of feet i was myself i seized
the second roll and started for the window

  put down that paper

  it was the doctor who spoke the clock
stood two minutes to ten

  put down that paper i

   laughed

  ill do nothing of the sort stop me
if you can

  in a flash he was at me here i knew
myself his master arms outstretched he
made for me and i could not help laugh-
ing at his awkwardness timing him to a
dot i let drive my left it was a well-
directed blow and i knew it for a knock-
out he was coming head on when my
blow landed

  landed say rather entered for my
fist entered his jaw like so much mist
passed through his head and out the other
side

  unable to believe my senses i shot out
my right it passed clean through him i
could see my fist out of his back

  with a cry of horror i sprang out of
his reach i could hear voices someone
was forcing the front door

  hendricks hendricks i screamed

 the old man was after me like a demon

aye hendricks he mocked hen-
dricks  fooled the father and ill fool
the son every twenty years i eat a man
and ill eat you as i have the others give
me that paper

he made a lunge and before i could
sidestep he had me i struggled but it was
useless it was like fighting with smoke i
knew i was gone i was helpless my
friend was outside

 but he was too late

here robinson lit a cigar

well i asked what hap-
pened

he puffed for a moment

hendricks will have to tell you the
rest my part is done go ahead hen and
give him the other part

 hendricks took up the narrative as fol-
 lows

chapter vi

what hendricks found

when robinson left my office i was
extremely puzzled

 my friend would do his best and if the
 old fox caught him unawares well then
 he was a slyer fox than i imagined

of the man himself i was morally cer-
tain i returned to my desk and studied
the picture over and over again they were
the same barring only the difference in
the style of the clothes which of course
counted for nothing

there was one thing and one thing
only which bothered me

these two men were of the same age
yet this picture had been taken over twenty
years before surely the living picture-
the man himself-should have aged some
in that length of time or was he one of
those upon whom years had no effect and
whom advancing age always finds at mid-
dle age stationary healthy and belying
their own looks

 the telephone rang

hello hello who is it

is this mr hendricks
almost immortal



  it is who is this

  brooks at rubic avenue we have
had the house under surveillance ever since
you detailed us mr robinson has just
returned the old lady-the housekeeper
the woman you mentioned-was just here
you are right all right she was mixed
up with the allen doreen affair and i
think she will be our main witness i want
you to get out here and have a talk with
her

  and by the way the old lady says
that this is the day and we want to
take no chances

  she has gone back to the house just at
present she is mortally afraid of the doc
says that if he rang and found her gone
he would surely kill her when can you
come

  right away i will be out there imme-
diately

  in a few minutes i was on a car bound
for rubic avenue

  my men i found in the house across the
street which they seemed to be making
their headquarters it was now five-thirty
well said i what news

  not much of anything said smythe
but we are awaiting the woman she
promised she would return as soon as you
arrived so we could settle all our plans
she says there is no danger until some
time after nine absolutely none because
the doctor as she calls him never works
at his trade or whatever you may call it
in the daytime

  brooks who is on the watch reports
that robinson and the doctor have just
entered one of the front rooms upstairs
and from the looks are playing cards
very likely i answered robinson
who has just left me says that is their
chief pastime

  then i told them about my interview
with robinson and the plans we had laid

  so you see our best tactics will be
to wait and watch

  well sir we waited

  about six came the old lady she was
terribly excited and very much worried
but beyond a recital of her former experi-

ence and the fact that she had heard the
doctor mumbling the twentieth the
twentieth several times during the past
few days i cant say that she had much
information to impart but on this one
thing she was very sure and very much
worked up

  oh how glad i am that you men are
here to help mr robinson she said
only im afraid terribly afraid perhaps
you are not smart enough oh hes clever
it will be just like him to do his work
right in front of you and you not be
able to do a thing

  he would have to be a devil to do
that said smythe i suppose you know
that the house is surrounded and that
nobody can leave it nor enter without at
least ten eyes upon him

  i know it i know it said the old
lady but whats been done before can
be done again  tell you for myself i
aint afraid he wont harm me but i
do care for this young man he wont
listen to me says hes not afraid and all
that but i tell you all quite frankly
the doctors not human no sir hes
something else when a man can do what
he does hes something and that aint
man either with that she left us

  there was a good deal in what she
said and i told them so but smythe
shook his head

  ive heard of this doreen case be-
fore mr hendricks read of it and i
have always said i would have liked to
have been there now heres our chance
we have robinson over there big and
strong athletic no fool and no coward
and we have a bunch of men around us
all of them trained all alert and we have
mrs green there in the house with them
and a code of signals everything is in our
favor we can catch the old fox red-handed
save robinson and clear up the doreen
mystery and all at the same time

we all of us settled down now to
our vigil from our vantage ground
of an upper room we could look across into
the room where sure enough sat robinson


famous fantastic mysteries

and the doctor both apparently enjoying
a friendly game of cards it was not too
close nor yet so far but that we could
make them out quite plainly the curtains
were open and of course a great deal of
the room was in our plain view

  well nothing happened the minutes
drew into hours and as the first excite-
ment wore away the time began to grow
lazy  began to get sleepy i think it was
some time after nine when brooks nudged
me

  look look whats robinson doing

  across the street i could see rob he
was rolling up a paper

  was it one or two

  i got up but he seemed to laugh and
lay it down again and to resume his
playing nothing more happened for about
a quarter of an hour then suddenly the
old man started from his chair pressed
his hand to his forehead and in a startled
way began to talk to his companion a few
moments later after he had resumed his
seat the dooropened and we could see
the old man and the old woman shaking
their fists angrily at each other-at least
the old woman shook hers then it was
that rob put the paper in the window

  ah exclaimed brooks now there is
something doing over yonder whatll we
do

  beginning to be interesting i an-
swered getting up you stay here brooks
while i get the men together keep a close
lookout if bob gives the other signal or if
you see anything suspicious be sure and
signal to us and wre will break in immedi-
ately

  below i gathered up the men placed two
at the back two at the sides and kept
with me two others every inch of the
house was to be watched the light was at
the window and the house was silent for
some time we waited but there was only
the thumping of our hearts and the ever-
lasting pulsating throb of the city night
after a little a window was raised and i
heard brooks voice

  hendricks he said coolly now is
your time enter quietly and make your

way up to the room youll have your

 man easy enough

   i had just reached the steps when a
 woman screamed and a frightened fearful
 cry it was to be sure and then running
 and almost falling i could hear someone
 coming down the stairs

   with a cry we made for the door but
 at the same instant the housekeeper opened
 it slammed it and stood before us she
 was white and trembling

   oh she cried for goodness sake
 hurry hurry its the devil sure sure
 its the devil

   woman i almost shrieked look what
 you have done we are locked out
 burst it burst it open came an order
 behind

   it was brooks

    hendricks get in there get in there
 with the force of two hundred pounds
 he landed against the door and in a min-
 ute we rolled men door locks and all a
 heap on the floor the woman screamed
 again and above everything i could hear
 a voice familiar and distinct it was rob

   at a bound i threw myself to my feet
 and dashed up the stairs a light was
 streaming beneath the door and there
 was a peculiar noise coming from the in-
 side a sort of chuckle brooks passed me
 and both together we landed against the
 door it was locked we knew that so
 we sent it crashing to the floor

   the room wras empty

chapter vii

visitor or visitation

 we were baffled defeated i had
 been laughed at to my face my best
 friend was gone

   a sort of haze came over me and for
 the next few minutes i remember almost
 nothing then i noticed the blaze of light
 the cards about the table the empty wine
 glasses and bottles and the soft green
 carpet while i could see brooks dashing
 about the room stamping on the floor
 pounding the walls and swearing a great
 copious string of heavy oaths
almost immortal



  you below therel he shouted are
those men here yet well hold tight 
dont let an inch of this house escape
you im going to comb over it with a
fine-tooth comb and if we dont get
him ill know hes the devil

  and thats what i think he is said
i i could have sworn i heard him when
i reached this door

  and i too returned brooks yet
here we are and there is neither hide nor
hair of him

  but however much my detective friend
agreed with me he would not as he said
allow superstition and mystic fear to get
the better of him and now while he had
a hand in the game and the tiling was
warm he was going to see the house from
top to bottom attic cellar and sideways

  keen over our lost prey we set to work
and i do not believe there was a house
searched as this one with the help from
headquarters we went at it from every
corner

  everything was ransacked rummaged
burst open examined walls were thumped
floors pounded ceilings tested and carpets
torn up but it all ended as i had fore-
seen

  when gray dawn struck it found a house
much like one stricken by an earthquake or
a whirlwind but never a clue that would
lead us anywhere at all of course i was
heart-broken over rob and i swore by
everything that i knew that i would never
leave off the trail until i had either rescued
or avenged him nor was i alone

  brooks with all his great confidence and
splendid nonchalance of a few hours be-
fore was a thing to look at truly he re-
minded me of a bloodhound chasing his
tail with all his skill and technique he was
getting nowhere when daylight came he
threw up his hands

  i tell you hendricks this is not a
case it is a study and i must have time
to think likewise-remembering himself
-i must eat but i tell you one thing
i will never leave this case until either i
or the doctor get each other

  anyway we ate and afterward we re-

turned and began our search all over again
and we kept it up day in and day out and
to be doubly sure we rented the place and
moved into it and we watched and waited
while the days grew into months and the
months into years until i found myself
five years older with a great practice and
a greater mystery

i had attained by hard grinding work
i think a very credible place in the
legal world i was not married and was
living with brooks in the house of mys-
tery as he chose to call it

  we kept a housekeeper-none other than
the old mrs green who had held the
same position under our spooky friend the
notorious dr runson for whom the po-
lice of every city of the world were looking
and not finding

  there was one great permeating idea
in the house find the doctor avenge
robinson and clear up the doreen mys-
tery

  brooks worked on the case as one who
would work on a puzzle me was always
ready had had the police oiled and ready
prepared at any moment to reach out and
grasp its victim

  then one night we received a sign

  at the time we had moved into the
house i had chosen a nice cozy room to
the rear and would have made that my
sleeping quarters had it not been for
brooks who expostulated in the loudest
manner

  there is but one room in the whole
house hendricks he said in which we
can sleep and that is the little room up
yonder to the front where this little scene
took place a few weeks back and there
well stay

  i remember plainly it was in september
i had been out to a social affair and did
not get in until about eleven oclock when
i turned on the light brooks was snoring
loudly his head back and his mouth wide
open as though he were enjoying it t
crawled into bed with him

  how long i slept i do not know but
when i awoke some time after with a


famous fantastic mysteries

 start it was to find brooks or at least
 i thought it was he sitting on my feet
 like any sleepy person i became angry

 hey you gee whiz brooks get off
 my feet

 someone at my side turned and i saw
 it was brooks

 whats the matter with you he said
 im not on your feet got a nightmare

 but i was not asleep and i knew it
 there was surely something on my feet
 so i raised up and looked sure enough
 seated there in the moonlight was the
 form of a man

 it was robinson

 for a moment i was dazed my heart
 jumping and my throat swollen

 dont you know me old boy it said

 hardly believing my own eyes nor my
 ears either i dropped back on the pillow
 and lay thinking finally i reached over
 and pinched brooks who was almost
 awake

 whats the matter

 do you see anything

 where

 at the foot of the bed on my feet

 pooh

 with an air of disgust and distrust my
 bedfellow raised himself and immediately
 dropped back on the pillow

 who-who is it he whispered

 the sound of his voice and the fact that
 he as well as i could see some one re-
 assured me for though i am hardly afraid
 of flesh and blood in the real personal
 form i like most other people have only
 a creepy sympathy with an apparition
 that brooks had seen and recognized was
 an assurance i needed for i must say i
 was in a cold sweat of fear and apprehen-
 sion i raised myself to a sitting posture

 well

 it was rob who spoke and it was the
 old voice

 is this really you rob i asked doubt-
 fully or just something else

 he laughed

 you think me a ghost dont you hen
 well to tell you the truth i am almost
 at least as near one as a man could get

  then-then you are not dead rob
no he answered im not dead nor
alive either for that matter

  he got up and walked about the room
and i noticed that his walk was ghostlike
no noise absolute silence and he nearly six
feet and one hundred and eighty pounds

  look here hendricks he stopped to
look at the clock ive got but a few
moments to spare it was only by super-
human struggle that i am here only by
a terrific battle of the will that i am with
you and at any moment any second i
may leave you i came to help you to
encourage you keep up your search and
some day you will be rewarded

  i will help you i am not dead far
from it i may live forever keep your
eyes open at all times and watch person-
alities i will try to lead them your way
only be prepared when the time comes
you were right about the doctor he was
a vampire i found out when it was too
late if you watch and work hard enough
i will have a chance to die even yet

  he stopped beside the bed and looked
at me longingly his eyes filled with a
yearning that was piteous my mind was
in a whirl and my heart was beating like
a trip-hammer but in the midst of it all i
had presence enough to analyze his fea-
tures the eyes were the same the hair
the jaw and the peculiar expression of
the mouth were all his beyond a doubt it
was robinson

  i remember the wild joy that surged
through me at the certainty i reached up
to grasp him but he drew back

  dont hen dont not now

  he drew back for not to be denied i
had sprung out of the bed and was pursu-
ing him with outstretched hands

  stop

  but i would not instead i followed him
across the room with my hands reaching
out for him

  well then if you must have it good-
by

  there was a good deal of the defiant in
the words and yet a world of misery and
with that he disappeared vanished through
almost immortal



the solid wall as though it were the open

air

chapter viii

pandoras box

of coltrse we dressed and began a
most thorough examination the
doors were locked the windows fastened
and everything was found in its accus-
tomed place we could get no satisfac-
tion there was no solution but one and
as i was no believer in ghosts or their
workings i was loath to accept it

  still what other solution could we give
it was either that or we had both of us
been the victims of a huge hallucination
and we were both of us too much awake
and had altogether too much pride and con-
fidence in our own intelligence to admit
that we could drift off into a state so bor-
dering on the insane as that how then
were we to account for it i admit i tossed
up my hands it was too much for me

  if rob was not dead and he said he
wasnt how had he gained entrance to
our room surely none but a fan tom could
have done that and no one mortal could
have vanished in such a complete and
marvelous manner furthermore if alive
what reason had he for keeping himself
hidden especially from his best friend
myself whose help he needed and from
whom he had just now sought assistance

  i could see none but one thing i did
do i cursed the impatient haste and un-
reason with which i had just acted had
it not been for my own foolishness and
lack of tact we might have had a few
good practical clues on which to work rob
must have had something to impart or
he would never have paid us this visit and
so i reasoned with brooks

  pshaw said my friend the man was
murdered thats plain as day wtho did
it is the goal the case has just begun
but im going to solve it believe me mean-
time im going back to bed

  going to bed and going to sleep were two
different things so we spent the rest of the
night in argument and in the consuming

of innumerable cigars and when the morn-
ing broke and the gray light of dawn
streamed through the windows it found
two men with two different views i for
the living and he for the dead

  which of us was right you shall see for
yourself

i was engaged on the huxly case with
which you and everybody else who
reads the papers must be familiar as i
have said i had risen not a little in my
profession my practice was large my
reputation established and best of all
i had the name of getting most anything
i went after

  at the same time i was on a dead level
with myself and knew my limitations even
though i did not let others into the secret

  the huxley case you will remember
was one of those paradises for attorneys
a sea of legal entanglements wherein they
could swim about to their hearts content
breathing law living law sleeping law
with no way out no exit no escape

  i was working night and day it was
the climax of my legal career if i won
i was made and i was going to win

  one day while deep in the huxly case
i had ordered my lunch and was looking
over a local paper there was not much
in it so i was running over the market re-
ports i dont know how to account for
it but i have always said that the great
and important changes of life are prone
to come upon us suddenly and unex-
pectedly

  and although i have always made it
a habit to watch the turning up of things
as it were it has ever been my fortune to
be caught like a drowsy sentinel asleep at
the post how little was i aware at this
moment everything was in the routine
the world was running smoothly so much
so in fact that i had to satisfy my crav-
ing for excitement with market reports

  it may have been the print or it may
have been anything im sure i dont know
exactly but anyway when i was half
through the page my eyes failed me and
the whole thing blurred


famous fantastic mysteries

  merely a case of nerves you say
perhaps so thats what i thought i
closed my eyes and pressed my fingers
against the eyballs the pressure brought
relief for an instant and i began rubbing
them a flickering and flashing of lights
clamored with myriad tattoo across my
brain and my head swam i opened my
eyes again and reached for a glass of water
the paper was still in my hand but it
was an inky black the light of absolute
nothingness and clean across it in plain
white letters was the word

robinson

  premonition you say perhaps it was
anyway it startled me the moment those
letters were indelible in my mind the room
cleared and my vision returned half
startled i looked about me

  everything was as before if anything
had happened nobody had noticed it it
was the same prosaic hungry crowd and
there was the usual sound of eating of
dishes and spoons and the quiet soft step
step step of flitting waiters

  nevertheless i was a perfect tingle of
excitement my hands shook and my heart
seemed to swell up within me to fill my
throat and choke me with anticipation
something was surely going to happen
carefully i studied everybody in the room
then i turned clear about and looked at
the door there it was

  it was rob

  he was standing just inside of the door
his soft hat slouched over his eye and his
empty pipe in his hand i could see the
cashier speaking to him but he shook his
head evidently he was looking for some-
one i had half risen from my seat when
our eyes met he smiled and came quickly
down the aisle how i watched him

  rob rob rob i said to myself
keeping time with his step as he came
toward me then hesitation the resem-
blance began to glimmer and fade away
the nearer he approached the less he
looked like rob could it really be he
how my wild hope rose and fell when

he was quite up to me i saw i was mis-
taken and that he was an absolute
stranger

  pardon me he said but were you
expecting me if you dont mind i will
sit opposite you you seemed to know me
know him on closer view he seemed
strangely familiar very much like another
there was a difference and a resemblance
which added together was indeed a puz-
zle

  your face said i reminded me
strangely i took you for some one-a
very old friend and yet it could not be
i see i am wrong

 why

  he looked up from the table with a
strange querulous smile

  why couldnt it be who is this per-
son

  a thought struck me

  your name is not robinson

  he sobered down in an instant and be-
gan arranging his knife and fork beside
his plate

  no he said eying his dish just
jones ebenezer jones fine name that
but suppose my name were robinson
what would it signify

  what would it signify i repeated
just this if your name were robinson
and you were the real person whom you
greatly resemble there would be a mystery
solved

  ha

  my companion dropped his fork and
looked up

  whats this he asked a mystery-
a real genuine live mystery have you
one sure enough lets have it thats my
line exactly its food and drink to me
he waited and before i knew it i was
telling him what you already know i dont
know why i should have told it there in
the restaurant but from the first he seemed
to have a power over me and through
it all i had that fluttering sensation and
my heart kept beating something will
happen something will happen
splendid he exclaimed when i was
through and have you this picture of
almost immortal



the doctor and a picture of robinson

  in my office yes

  may i see them

  certainly

  well i would be much obliged to you
this interests me deeply we shall go up
after we eat

  in another half hour we were examin-
ing the photos

  so this is robinson and this is dr
runson eh might have been twins but
for thirty years or so eh well i tell you
mr hendricks you neednt worry in less
than six months you will know all about
it no you dont believe it well well
wait and see i have a strange power
and what i say generally comes true even
if my name is just plain ebenezer jones
now mr hendricks i have a proposi-
tion to make how would you like a busi-
ness associate

  he staggered me

  well an assistant if you will call me
anything you like i will name my own
terms salary nothing and as much work
as you can get out of me

  i was taken back

  know anything about the law

  he laughed and his eyes fairly danced
with amusement the chief justice could
not have been more amused at the ques-
tion

  just give me a trial is all i ask i
want to stay in this office until this mys-
tery is solved and while im here i want
something to do youll find it to your
advantage i know something about law
and then some even though my name may
be just plain ebenezer jones

wrell to make the matter short i
took him in

  it was a rather sudden and strange
thing to do on such a short acquaintance
i was a little surprised at myself at first
but soon found that i had made no mis-
take indeed before many days i was shak-
ing hands with myself

  ebenezer settled into my office with an
ease and a confidence that could only come
from ability and energy and he tore into

cases with a vim that was irresistible 
had asked him whether he knew anything
about the law i was soon laughing at my-
self

  was there anything about the law that
he didnt know that fellow was a veri-
table encyclopedia he seemed to have it
all in his head he became the brains of
the office i might well enough have burned
my books i began asking questions and
soon quit referring to my library i found
it was useless all i got was a verification
of his statements

  naturally i prospered we won the
huxly case hands down although i knew
it was ebenezers brain and not mine that
did it

  still i got the credit so i had no kick
coming other cases came our way we won
them all it was so easy that it was amaz-
ing i congratulated both myself and him

  fudge he said its nothing theres
nothing to the law but the knowing

  and i guess he was right anyway i was
in high spirits my reputation was bound-
ing up i became a boy again success
breeds dreams i could see great pictures
ahead if i could keep this genius at work
i would be chief justice

  the mystery

  it had grown so old that i was beginning
to despair of it i had to be sure a rest-
less feeling a sort of nervous certainty
that it would be cleared up some day but
i had become so used to waiting that it
had become a sort of habit i was helpless
and could do nothing and there was only
hope of one thing i was certain-robin-
son would show up some day somehow a
sort of subconscious wisdom seemed to
tell me that

  was it the mystery that held ebenezer
it must have been though what he was
going to gain by sitting in my office or
how he was going to solve it by doing
nothing i could not make out there was
only one clue and that was his resem-
blance to rob when i questioned him
about it he always laughed

  if i were rob i think you would know
it hendricks no no boy youre on the


famous fantastic mysteries

wrong track then after a while after a
good many minutes of silence and think-
ing youll have to wait old boy only i
tell you things may happen and when
they do keep your wits about you

  but nothing happened in spite of his
words

  days wore into weeks and weeks into
months and we dug into the laws eben-
ezer was at it early and late and i did my
best to keep up with him i offered him a
partnership but he refused it when i
tried to have a moneyed understanding
he laughed at me

  i have so much of that stuff that it
nauseates me i prefer to work for nothing
and see what turns up

  he had no bad habits that i could no-
tice and i watched him closely he always
brought a bottle of port wine with him and
drank it all during the day that is what
i did not help him with also he smoked
occasionally only it was an old seedy
pipe such as you would expect an eben-
ezer jones to smoke

  there was only one thing in his habits
or possessions that could arouse my curi-
osity that was a small case which he
always carried with him it was not more
than three inches square and could be con-
veniently carried in his pocket the first
thing he did on entering the office was to
lock this in his desk and when he left at
night it went with him without fail once
he opened it quite accidentally and i no-
ticed with surprise that it contained two
small bottles both of them full of a liquid
and that the color was of port wine

  they say it was pandora who opened the
box of a certainty that mythical young
lady was an ancestor of mine t can under-
stand her feelings exactly they must have
been tantalizing something told me i must
open that box of course i revolted against
the feeling i fought it fiercely all the
ethics of my nature and training warned
me and pleaded with me

  it was no use there was still that feel-
ing perverse and ever there my fingers
itched and my heart yearned for that case

  why i should have had it i could not

tell it was a freak of my own nature or
the hand of fate my lower self seemed
bound to triumph in this one case al-
though my manhood and integrity kept
saying no no thou shall not

  after all what did it amount to i
would repeat merely a case and two bot-
tles examine them and return them no
one will be harmed and you will be satis-
fied	

  well it went on that way for a good
many days and all the time i felt myself
growing weaker it was a trivial thing in
itself but the fight i put up against it
made it with me a matter of some magni-
tude

  at length i came to it i resolved to ex-
amine the case and in this way relieve my-
self of this everlasting torment it was a
simple thing in itself and were it not for
its strange aftermath i would soon have
forgotten it

chapter ix

two drops

ebenezer had stepped out of the
office for a few minutes leaving his
desk unlocked it was quickly done i
stepped over to his desk drew out the
drawer and took therefrom the little case
of mystery

  a slight pressure and the thing flew
open disclosing the two small bottles i
knew it to contain i remember wondering
why the two bottles instead of one inas-
much as they contained the same liquid
but did they

  perhaps they only looked alike to satis-
fy myself i picked up one of the bottles
opened it and smelled it had absolutely
no odor and of course i dared not taste it
it was full to the overflowing and as my
hand trembled somewhat a drop fell on
the wine-glass that was resting on the desk
i replaced the cork and was about to open
the other bottle when footsteps in the
hall-ebenezers feet-put a speedy end
to my investigation

  in a minute i had closed the case and
resumed the seat at my own desk
almost immortal



  hello said ebenezer

  he placed his hat upon the desk and
taking the wine-glass poured himself a
large drink then in horror i recalled the
spilled drop

  horrors what is-

  no use for more it was done

  at first he stood stark still his hand
raising wonderingly to his head and his
eyes questioning then his frame shook and
his color began to change first to a yellow
then to a dark green he was the most
uncanny thing i ever looked at a being
dropped from another planet

  mercy he exclaimed it is done

  then with a furious haste he tore open
the desk and seized the case and vanished
into the dressing-room i could hear the
lock crash as he turned the key then he
fell but he must have risen immediately
for i could hear someone walking then a
voice-no a cry and how it rang

  in the name of heaven hendricks
open the door it is i-rob oh before
it is too late hurry hurry break it
down

  with a cry of fury i flung myself at the
door it held

  hurry hurry came the despairing
call from the other side then another
voice cut in

  shut up and come here im master
yet

  something fell and then there was the
tramping of many feet a struggle seemed
to be going on and above it all the voice
of men-not two nor three but of a multi-
tude in the midst of my frantic haste i
could hear it awful excited despairing
the incoherent shoutings of all nationali-
ties german greek french italian and
above it all the voice of a master

  this way this way there now there
now

  in a perfect frenzy of haste i seized an
implement and splintered the door and
as it fell back sprang into the room

  it was empty

  no not quite

  ebenezer jones was standing at the win-
dow watching the street below

  why he smiled you must be in a

hurry mr hendricks do you always enter
a room in this manner

  shamefaced and abashed i stood there
puzzled a fool shown up in the height of
his folly i was about to become a hero i
came crashing through the door ready to
grapple with a multitude and instead i
was laughed at humbly i drew my hand-
kerchief and mopped my face

  excuse me mr jones i ventured
but i-i surely heard strange noises in
this room

  strange what

  noises

  tut tut hendricks he came over to
me and laid his great brawny paw on my
shoulder what noises did you hear
why i said i heard or thought i
heard my dear old friend robinson he
was calling to me right in this room beg-
ging me to open the door and there were

others-lots of them you had the door

                                                t

locked so i smashed it down

  i see you did picking it up and plac-
ing it against the wall but you didnt
find rob did you nor the others just
plain old ebenezer jones he laughed and
slapped me on the back just plain old
ebenezer jones wthat do you know about
that isnt it awful and he went off into
a peal of laughter and laughed and
laughed and laughed hendricks he said
you should have seen yourself come
through that door oh how funny it was
you should have been a soldier youd be
a general

  and that is how it ended humiliated
shamed and doubting laughed at and half
laughing at myself i returned to work
but i had a feeling that after all i was
right and not such a big fool as ebenezer
jones would have me believe and the
feeling grew it was not long before it be-
came a conviction and conviction brought
action

  i began to see the light

ebenezer went to work as though
nothing had happened so did i but
now after the peculiar experience through
which i had gone i began to take a new
interest in my strange companion for


famous fantastic mysteries

hours i watched him wondering and figur-
ing from now on he was an enigma and
open question-mark

  i had taken him at first for a queer char-
acter one of those strange personages of
whom we have so many in our midst who
for a mere whim or for love of any kind
of adventure will adapt themselves to any
place or person in order to watch the
course of events and be in on the denoue-
ment that he had more than a curious
interest in the disappearance of rob i had
not dreamed hitherto i had taken him for
what he looked and now i felt myself
deceived

  once on a train of new thoughts i
worked fast why his resemblance to rob
whence this almost uncanny knowledge of
the law this almost unhuman legal mind
which knew everything and which cared
so little for its rewards why his total dis-
like for money society and honor why
too-and i reasoned it over many many
times-the two small bottles

  and why - yes - the one bottle - one
drop the sudden effect the noises the mul-
titude and rob

  it was not a nice feeling to be sure
but just the same far from being ashamed
of what i had done  was resolved on
playing the same trick over again on the
first opportunity

  from now on i watched and waited
eagerly for the little packet of mystery
once he took it from his pocket and was
about to lay it on his desk when something
diverted him and he gave it a steady
studious look something akin to wonder-
ment it seemed to me and with a sudden
strange motion snapped it back into his
pocket

  then he looked over at me it was a
strange look something i could not under-
stand there was something of power and
yet of a strange terrible weakness

  could it be that this man was a fiend
ah no the answer came back with the
same thought surely not

  yet all through that day and several
more that followed there was a strange
feeling between us and at times i could

feel his eyes upon me a most uncomfort-
able thing i had the impression of being
feared and watched by a wonderful su-
perior power i dont know that there is
anything more uncanny than that with a
weaker will you at least know that you are
the master but when a stronger begins to
fear the resultant fear that it engenders in
you is so haunting and depressing that it
becomes horrible

  not that he was not the same ebenezer
he was that and he wasnt the outward
appearance and actions were the same it
was the psychological that changed there
was a shiftiness a changing the eye spoke
a lie and the personality seemed to be
fluttering i dont know of anything that
could have moved me more or set me to
thinking harder there was fear appeal
and terror in those eyes i felt that i was
being called on and that action was needed

  hallucination say you

  so it seemed to me but it was so real
so earnest and i was so certain of it that
nothing would have diverted me what
would i do and how would i do it there
was that in those eyes which told me i
could do something i was convinced that
the scene in the dressing-room was a real-
ity not a fantom of my own mind

  there were there must have been many
people in that room it was ebenezers
secret and it should be mine show a man
that which he cant have and that he
shall have there was but one way-the
bottles i would try them again

  as i said to all outward appearances
ebenezer was the same he had the abil-
ity the jovialness the personality it was
only in the shifting individuality of the
eyes with their appeal their fear and the
resultant effects that he was at all different
from the first ebenezer that had entered
my office

  his manners were the same his talk and
his application he still drank his bottle of
port and he still went out for walks each
morning he deposited the little case inside
his desk and every time as regularly as
he went out it went with him

  how i did watch that case how i did
almost immortal



want to lay my hands on it but there was
no use i could not take it away from him
i must work in secret

  one morning a very momentous one to
me ebenezer was late he had a right to
be sure for who has not when he works
for nothing however he had always been
so prompt before that i noticed with sur-
prise this one slip of punctuality and i
was more surprised nay almost alarmed
when he jarred open the door

  there was an appearance of one who had
been out all night his eyes were blood-
shot and his hair had a sort of stand-up-
and-refuse-to-lie-down look although it
had been well flattened with the brush in
one hand he carried a bottle of port in
the other i noted with surprise the case

  without noticing me-wre were always
very cordial with our greetings-he walked
up to his desk more like a soldier than
anything and deposited thereon the bottle
and the case

  there now he said and without
another word turned on his heel and
marched out of the room

  a few moments later i saw him entering
a building on the other side of the street
there was an act of finality about it that
startled me a sort of defiance that un-
nerved me

  was it a challenge anyway there was
the case

wtth a feverishness that was a mix-
ture of fear hope and eagerness i
pressed open the cover there they were
the two of them small small receptacles
of mystery what did they not contain

  my hand trembled and my mind blur-
red here was one of the mysteries of the
world a secret of many things

  and i-i must see must hear and must
know i held them up and examined them

  ah i muttered as by inspiration the
dose and the antidote ebenezer this is
your waterloo see i almost laughed
with glee one drop raised hell two drops
will raise more hell i poured two drops
in his glass so and now old boy ill
say checkmate

  with this i took out the other bottle
and placed it in my pocket then i re-
placed the first bottle and put the case
where i had found it when all was ready
i returned to my desk and took up my
work

  what a difference there was on the
former occasion i was all excitement and
guilt i felt i had committed a crime and
was ashamed of myself i had lost all
honor and self-respect and now although
excited i had a feeling of triumph of cer-
tainty of right i was dead sure i was the
instrument of providence and i remem-
bered ebenezers own words

  things may happen and when they
do keep your wits about you

  well i had them about me now also
i had a hammer to batter down the door
if necessary

  after what seemed an age ebenezer re-
turned

  wrell he said hows things

  fine i answered

  thats good same here was out late
last night first time for a long while

  theater i asked

  oh no just going around made me
sleep late though actually i thought
this morning i could sleep for a hundred
years have some he produced his bot-
tle and poured himself a good drink

  not this morning

  i was hoping he would not insist

  well here goes

  he held it up eyed it for a moment
and then drank it at a gulp

  so i said and raised from my seat
so

  it was just as i expected he turned
sickly and was powerless the two drops
had done the business his eyes were-
heavens what eyes they were the most
unholy thing i had ever gazed into-
cavernous burning-defiant the eyes of a
lost soul at the bar of judgment he
raised his hands to the sides of his head

  at last he said at last

  and oh the finality of those four words
the despair

  then with furious haste he tore open


famous fantastic mysteries

his desk like a fleeting thing his hand
went around the drawers it was not there

  good heavens he murmured draw-
ing back this is murder

  and in a flash of thought he was in the
dressing-room

the door with the speed of fury it seemed
an age from inside came the old voice
the master s voice and it said

   kill you

  and oh the struggle there were blows
and hate and above all the screaming
staccato of many tongues hatred despair
revenge

  bang

  i let the door have it right in the cen-
ter it shivered and caved the middle part
demolished bang i struck at the hinges
with a crash it fell to the floor and over
it i sprang into the room

  as i live i shall never see it again the
room was full of humanity naked and
struggling they were rolled into an inex-
tricable mass there was hissing and
gnashing of teeth and in the center in the
midst of it all was a horrible thing it
was battling the multitude such a strug-
gle i had never seen before it heaved
fought shoved and struck and still they
came on if it were not master it was giv-
ing a good account of itself

  suddenly by a gigantic effort it raised
itself up flung back its assailants like so
many flies and made straight for me two
eyes-a monstrous thing

  you it hissed

  with a cry of horror i backed against
the wall its hand touched me and i felt
my body grow cold as ice

  not yet

  a form flashed between us and a hand
grasped its throat it was robinson

  back hen back as you value your
life back

  then he sailed into it their forms
buckled together heaved and tossed into
the air they passed in and out of each
other like mist the others came to help
but their actions were slow and aged

  such a struggle i shall never see again
i can see myself yet crouched against the
wall watching that battle of fan toms i
was too bewildered to be afraid too horri-
fied to analyze like a dream i was pas-
sive unable even to think

  suddenly there was a heaving and toss-
ing and the form of rob shot into the air
he and the thing were locked together
when they came down rob was on top
the battle was over the thing lay still
rob backed away

  behold the end of azev avec

  it shuddered and rolled over and lifted
up its head i saw it was akin to a man
only black and terribly aged it seemed to
be shriveling from its ghastly mouth came
a sound

  robinson it said

rob stepped closer and then knelt down
what is it azev and his face grew
kind and pitiful one could see that if he
had any resentment it was buried in pity
for what had to be done

  goodby robinson you win you were
too strong alls yours now i should have
picked someone with a weaker will it
was a great fight no resentment no hard
feeling live ten thousand years almost
immortal 

  all the time his form was shriveling and
his voice growing fainter

  there now said rob drawing away
doreen come on

  from out of the mass of shadows step-
ped a form

  now then hen open the door and into
your office there now

  we were alone the three of us

  now take that other bottle pour two
drops for me in port wine there now
give it to me

  i held it to his lips and he drank it at a
gulp the effect was immediate and as-
almost immortal



tonishing his appearance lost its fantom
shadowness and he became real and hu-
man a man of flesh and blood

   almost danced with joy i seized him
by the hand and fairly blubbered with my
happiness

  and now give me the bottle

  he took it from me and with a steady
nand prepared a dose for his shadow
friend

  behold us said rob standing by the
side of doreen the two mysteries the
two solutions now lets look at the
others

  he stepped to the dressing-room door
and beckoned me the room was empty

  where are they i asked

  they were dead long ago he an-
swered their minds and souls were alive
they were imprisoned and feeding on the
body of doreen and myself come into the
office and i will tell you all

there now he said when he had
rested himself i will make it as
short as i can as doreen and i both want
clothes and we both want to go out into
the freedom of the street do you remem-
ber what you said about the doctor you
were right he was a vampire for ten
thousand years he had been feeding on

human flesh his real name was azev
avec dr runson was merely a com-
posite-so was ebenezer jones

  about ten thousand years ago some-
where south of the himalayas azev was
born the son of a high priest and an in-
dian princess his wife his father was a
man deeply immersed in magic or mys-
ticism or whatever you choose to call it
and held in addition an almost uncanny
knowledge of the natural laws among
other things he acquired a knowledge of
solids he early discovered what we all
know now that no solid is really what the
name implies but a mass of infinitesimal
particles held together in a single mass by
two forces of nature cohesion and ad-
hesion

  knowledge like this was to a man of
his nature and profession only an incentive
for tremendous endeavor the remainder
of his life was spent with one object-the
control of the particles of a solid or to be
precise some means by which man might
control and manipulate the forces of co-
hesion he himself did not succeed but
on his death passed his work and knowl-
edge on to his son azev

  now azev added to his fathers knowl-
edge a poetic foresight he saw that
with this power simply by increasing the

space between the particles a solid would
become a mist and that one could pass
through fire stone or water without dan-
ger and with the same ease with which
one swarm of gnats passes through another

  he worked hard and he succeeded
but when success came he found that he
was an old man and that life had passed
without his enjoying any of its pleasures
the thought terrified him he hated to die
without at least one great splurge of plea-
sure but to enjoy pleasure he must have
youth and that had passed long long be-
fore then the devil spoke

  if you have no youth you can get it
steal it of what use is all this learning
and knowledge if you are going to die

  the idea appealed and azev looked
around him he selected a young man
about twenty years of age beautiful
strong and athletic and invited him to
supper at a favorable moment he passed
him the draft and while his body was in
the misty state entered and took posses-
sion after taking the antidote their bodies
became one

  there were two minds but azevs was
so much the stronger that the other soon
became a negligible thing a mere occa-
sional whim thus was faust antedated
by about nine thousand eight hundred
years azev found himself a young man
again thirty years of age strong and
healthy

  a career of dissipation followed in a
few years the body was soft and flabby
so he stole another and so on when he
was in danger of death he merely took on
another form it worked like a charm

sometimes he went in for dissipation
sometimes for learning sometimes for
wealth he became probably the richest
and most learned man on earth

  he hobnobbed with kings and emper-
ors alexander the great sent for him on
his death bed and had he arrived in time
the great macedonian would never have
died at thirty-three caesar was his friend
virgil his confidant he witnessed the birth
of christianity he chummed with nero
and by the lurid light of burning chris-
tians saw the religion of europe spring
into its youth

  down through the ages he went always
enjoying himself and always in someone
elses body he was the merlin of king
arthur he was the body servant of bar-
barossa and he alone of all the earth
knew the sleeping-place of him of the long
red beard

  he stood a fair chance of living for-
ever there were but two chances against
him fatal accidents and the absorption of
a will stronger than his owrn so long as
his will was the strongest he ruled the
body allen doreen was nearly his equal
i was slightly his superior it took me
five years of terrific struggle to gain any
advantage at all then i warned you

  another struggle and i associated with
you placed opportunities in your way
tempted you deliberately with the bottles
and you fell

  here i am i am robinson again but
i am much more

  ah of azev avecs wealth is mine like-
wise his learning and wisdom

  now get us some clothes


fruit of the forbidden tree

             by leslie burton blades

    into the infinite they hurled their brains to solve the ultimate mystery

i read the scrawled note attached to
a bulky manuscript that i had just
received with a sudden sene of
disaster vague and terrifying for i knew
these men well and i could not but accept
the half-mad note as reality

    carry has gone out vanished utterly and
  in a moments time i am alone in the lab-
  oratory among all the psychological appa-
  ratus with which we have experimented so
  long

    would to heaven we had never attempted
  this last mad project but it is too late to
  regret for he is gone in the room a vibrant
  unseen force like an unbodied will is
  forcing me to complete what i began

    when you receive this it will probably
  be over but  want you to come to the
  laboratory do what must be done and
  give this report to the world it is our last

 great contribution to science and both carry
 and myself desire it to be published

as ever

                            davis

something had happened at the labora-
tory of my two friends the great experi-
mental psychologists which had resulted
in tragedy

 hastily collecting the report i called
 my car and drove at once to the laboratory
 as davis had requested

 save for the vast collection of experi-
 mental appliances for testing brain force
 the books on the mind a few disordered
 papers and its usual furniture the place
 was empty

 i submit the report mailed me without
 explanation nothing i can say will be

of value and the document must speak for
itself what it declares is true i knew
both men and i have seen the laboratory
where they ended their work for the
rest psychologists must attempt explana-
tions which a mere novice like myself
could only clumsily propose it follows

report of experiments
in analysis of the
composition of
the human soul
experimental psychologists

davis and carry
a and s laboratory february  

  the laboratory was heavy with cigar
smoke and the big incandescent in the
center of the table flared through the
gloom lighting carrys face oddly as he
sat opposite me

  davis he said slowly through his
veil of smoke we have succeeded in
telepathy we are skilled in hypnosis and
we have demonstrated the ability of con-
sciousness to turn into itself and observe
its own inner workings why not go on
to an analysis of the human soul we
might discover its composition-the soul
stuff

  i stared at him in amazement for i knew
that his entire scientific career had been
that of a materialistic psychologist who
denied soul asserting that the mind was
a mere cooperation of living nerve and
muscle cells

  of course you are surprised he re-
marked casually for i had allowed him
to read my thought telepathically i dont
believe in the soul any more today than
i ever did but i am a scientist and there-
fore willing to assume its existence till
we can test it

  we can never do that i asserted posi-
tively i was always opposed to carrys
wild hypotheses that is the mystery
which science cannot explain

  he smoked in silence for a moment then
i was allowed to see his mind we rarely
talked aloud at such times preferring to
communicate telepathically as a quicker
and clearer method of understanding

you know he was thinking his lips

closed around his cigar we have made
larger leaps in our work before this seems
simple we can go at it from our separate
points of view you believe that mind is
an ethereal pure spirit in touch with the
body by some non-material attachment
i dont but we can accept your belief as
a starter i will go at it my way you by
yours

  i do not see the method i answered
though my voice was silent

  i will take the evolutionary view and
go down into the remnant nerves of my
spine and sympathetic system they are
after all the heritage of man from his beast
ancestry and if i could get my conscious-
ness into them i might discover what this
life energy-soul if you like-really is

  but to get down into them is not pos-
sible

  i think it is we could do this you
hypnotize me and direct my mind into
them  will report back telepathically what
i find i might descend clear into protozoan
life and if the mystery still operated i
would go back of organic life to the un-
known-the beginning of life god-and
report findings through my body which
would still be under your control

the proposal was stupendous with pos-
sibilities if he succeeded we would
have discovered the origin and essence of
life itself with that knowledge man could
mold soul in the future as easily as a pres-
ent day biologist works with organic mat-
ter bacteria and their activities or as a
chemist with material elements

  there was an obvious danger however
if carry got so far from his body he might
be unable to return

  i know he said aloud i might go
under but its worth risking

  i dont believe that is the direction
one would have to go if the soul is
analyzed it must be done by going up into
forms of consciousness beyond-above the
human

  that is your part of the experiment
he replied you can attempt it and one
of us will succeed which will it be
fruit of the forbidden tree



  neither i said shortly the risk is
too great and i wont attempt it there is
my wife you know

  he nodded appreciation for single
though he was he was not without tender-
ness though one rarely saw it in his cold
manner

  we dropped the subject there but it kept
recurring over a period of two years then
my wife died

  such a shock as her death was can only
be appreciated by those who have buried
their lifes love and are left childless to
go on through desolate years

  for months i suffered in silence and dur-
ing that time carrys proposal kept re-
curring more and more vividly  came to
feel that should i succeed i might pene-
trate the spirit world and find her

  one night i became aware of her pres-
ence in my room i could almost see her
brown eyes looking at me and i was sure
i heard her voice urging me to attempt
the experiment carry had proposed again
and again that feeling came to me until
at last i told carry we would make the
experiment he desired that was a month
ago tonight we have undertaken it and
as dawn comes this report will end with
it our story will be completed and i will
follow carry

  even as i write here in this silent
laboratory i am driven by mad emotion
a translated longing which is thrust into
my very soul-center by some terrific force
that makes the air quiver about me

  dawn and will i see it yes but from
what sphere i know not while strength
lasts i must write however for in that
alone is there peace in this report alone
can either of us live henceforward may
the world find our work good

  at eight oclock we locked the labora-
tory doors drew the blinds and faced each
other i shall never forget the expression on
carrys face his piercing eyes seemed al-
ready penetrating the veil that shrouds
the spirit world above that bulging fore-
head that always suggested cliff like rugged-
ness of mind his shock of black hair tipped
with silver looked unusually rumpled the

firm thin lips upon which a smile so sel-
dom appeared now curved in boyish antici-
pation as though he were in expectation of
some great happiness

  davis he said in a tone of eager de-
light tonight will go down in history
and be forever memorable as the great time
of scientific discovery

  yes i answered and we will go
with it if we live

  what matter if we live or die man
we will be the same to the future come
now are you ready

  he crossed to the lrge divan we had
arranged in one corner and sat down
then as if moved by a premonition he
looked around taking in every detail of
the room that had framed his life work
something in his eyes stirred me for i
fancied i read a vague but certain knowl-
edge in them that he was seeing it all for
the last time his books the charts our
many instruments and me

  for heavens sake carry dont look
at me that way  realized as i spoke that
i was nervous and agitated

  come on davis lets begin his even
voice soothed me and he lay full length
upon the divan

  before i hypnotize you-i paused be-
side him-what is it exactly you want me
to do with your mind i must be sure of
what i am doing

  direct it into the unused nerve ganglia
set it to work there reliving the life in
which that nerve was operative get its
telepathic report of the experience keep it
going down down-till it passes out of
nerve cells and is in cooperation with mere
living protoplasm and if need be send
it back of all life

   met his unperturbed gaze carry old
man im afraid i faltered brokenly
there are things not even science in the
interest of mankind dares touch and the
source of being-the origin of life hereto-
fore closed to our vision-is one god is
jealous of his mysteries

  i am waiting davis

  without a word we clasped hands and i
sent him to sleep with the directions driven


famous fantastic mysteries

into his sleeping mind like a sharp wedge
of my will it was as though an invisible
arm of my soul reached into his and held it
fast that it might be drawn back from its
wandering-but alas the figure is sad
the sense of security it created is now
a flaming reproach yet i went on with the
work and shall go on with it still till i
have found my friend again

there was a moment of tense silence
and my straining mind caught no word
from the soul of that daring explorer then
my name flashed before my consciousness
we had finally established telepathic com-
munication

  davis a long pause then in a swift
short thought we can do it i am deep
in my own spinal cord is my face alter-
ing look closely and tell me i must know
at once

  no why i studied his calm features
so reposed

  i am occupying what is left in my
nerve organism of the first biped life of
my ancestry i felt that i must be taking
on his-their squat forehead and pointed
brute nose

  i took a pen and began to make notes as
he went on it might be of some little value
to submit a few of his reporting phrases
verbatim

  i shall do so hoping that they may aid
future psychologists

notes

  i have not time left before i follow
carry to revise these notes therefore i
shall merely submit them as taken before
his statements in italics i have placed his
initials all else is comment of my own
upon my feelings as i listened

  c i find i can roar like a gorilla not
one but some gigantic beast like it you
know no soul as such abounding energy
ha-ha-ha i laugh for sheer joy in life
life a great swell of impulses mainly in-
terpreted as-love of blood hunger pas-
sion fighting

  as  received this i was suddenly
gripped by a terror for in that thought-
message a new guttural quality of speech-

form had appeared slightly blurring the
words i felt in some way chilled as though
i confronted a hairy savage thing that
reached for me with great muscular arms
eyes bloodshot and merciless

  c thats it

  carrys own thought answered my feel-
ing

  c youve got the picture good no
soul only great strength of muscle flooded
with life dont know what life means as
such going on now

  i waited pen in hand beside the still
form of my friend my heart beat regu-
larly i was taken with tendencies to shiver
and then out of the silence a terrific roar
burst upon my brain it was so vivid i
started thinking it actual sound but
carrys lips were closed and no sound had
escaped them i gripped the pen and
waited after a moment i got his thought
it came from what seemed infinite dis-
tance fainter than usual and more con-
fused

  c davis-greatest feeling of power
big as a house must be deep in old life-
forms like ichthy sauries you know scaly
and brutal raging all over like a shivering
savage blood mad but no soul not much
sensitivity mere raging life-stirred flesh

  there was a silence here then again

  c great heavens feel as if i could crush
your whole petty civilization under one
hand-no not hand flipper davis-big
steel-clawed flipper no soul though brain
mighty small and coarse not much spinal
cord but lot of energy energy seems to be
the essence of life not soul motion thats
it-lust for movement

  for fifteen minutes i waited spellbound
in that laboratory when i was almost in
despair and reached to touch carrys face
that i might bring him to himself i fancied
that he called or rather felt his thought as
it reached me

  c pterodactyl flying on wide feather-
less wings immense heights teeth that
clash together almost no brain and what a
lust for extension of movement i being it-
self becomes mere elaboration of motion
flying flying
fruit of the forbidden tree



  of course i was familiar with these forms
of which he spoke for it was necessarily
part of my knowledge to understand the
life history as geology reveals it but that
in no way reduced the sudden agony that
sent my blood cold

  i became aware of a slight palpitation
of the air in the laboratory as though un-
seen electric currents moved around me
a dim sensation of pain attacked my head
and vague impressions of a ruthless will
opposing mine made me afraid was a
stronger will an unknown mind-force at-
tempting to break my hold on carrys
mind far down in the dead past i gritted
my teeth and sent his name out with all
brain power

  c here i dont understand things
mere glutinous mass of stuff no nerves-
life yes but vague groping and not
limited to organism mere life force every-
where among great masses of rolling proto-
plasm water and blazing burning heat no
eyes no individuality-no thought not
even instincts

  for heavens sake tell me my body is
real alive and with you

  the last was a cry of anguish and i
answered but my thought seemed blocked
by that increasing force about me i was
not sure that he got it if so he made no
reply

  his body was now stiff and cold yet his
heart acted and his respiration was even
though shortened

  i laid a hand on his breast to keep close
watch of his heart then i became aware
that his flesh was changed-different in
some inexplainable way and i shouted
aloud to him in terror

just one more of these noted state-
ments it seems advisable to include
the two or three others i have destroyed
it came to me after an interminable wait
all the tense nervous fear of a lost man
had flooded me i sat oppressed and white
for that unknown power had swelled in
the room until it crowded me the lights
went out and yet i could see there was
no defined light such as we of the modern

world know yet the room was not dark

  every article in it seemed held crowded
by light whose essence was substance that
could form itself around an object i was
shrouded in it and found movement diffi-
cult my chest was heavy and i gasped
while invisible more terrible was that
gigantic throbbing will that seemed tear-
ing at my own as i sought to hold to that
of my friend much as a fighter seeks to
separate an antagonists grip from his
throat

  c davis unable to think lost beyond
matter in the preworld time great swirl-
ing vortex of fire-mist brilliant light
awful and charged with will savage try-
ing to drown me in fire can never reach
body again going under goodby if my
soulless body still breathes kill it carry

  as he ceased i was shaken as though
some vicious hand had laid hold of my
shoulder i started to my feet a ghastly
pallor was spreading over carrys face
his skin was hard seamed and scaly

  i caught up an electric galvanizer and
applied it to his chest it sputtered
snapped into silence and was useless

  in despair i reached for a revolver we
kept in the table drawer while that domi-
nating force seemed to be throbbing a
rhythmic agony through me

  wait

  i turned to meet the open eyes of the
body on the divan they were not carrys
eyes for no intellect shone in their red
fire depths only a rending fear was there
looking out at me with eager hunger for
aid and his thickened blue lips moved
clumsily as he spoke blotched uncertain
words without precision as though an
animal suddenly found tongue

  i got back but not for long conscious-
ness burned to nothing mere cinder of a
soul but i know what we want to know
the soul is a spark of divine god-and
god is is-

  he ceased speaking and his body jerked
spasmodically before i could move it
twisted writhed became horrible-while
over the features a series of changes passed
in a flash i saw them change from human


famous fantastic mysteries

to beast features ugly misshapen grim
with hanging lips and great teeth then
onto the floor rolled what had been a man
i swear it was the long thick body of a
serpent red-eyed terrible with great rough
scales that gave out a grating noise on
the floor

  i could not move that vibrating agony
of power held me as though i were bound
before my eyes it danced in a whirl of
gleaming points violet red and white

  through the glare of them i saw that
serpent then as i started a wild laugh
carrys laugh as it might have been had
he gone mad sounded through the labora-
tory the thing on the floor grew dim
its outline grew less distinct a film of gray
shrouded it and the whole became vaguely
transparent it spread moved and in a
sudden small cloud was gone

  i was alone with that force in the room
and a thunder of thought reverberated in
my head

  in the day that ye eat of the tree of
knowledge ye shall surely die

  i sank upon a chair and covered my
eyes to shut out those swirling lights my
face was wet with perspiration

  i am alone in the laboratory yet i know
that i am not alone with me is that
power and in it i know carry still lives
i feel him beside me and he urges me to
go up up-as we agreed i should into the
higher realms of spirit life

  i must obey for the force drives me
is it a mockery am i too being deceived
by the imagined spirit of carry that i may
be destroyed i cannot tell yet i must try
the experiment as planned

  one thing comforts me i feel my wife
near and i am assured that she will be
waiting more than that i am a man of
will  shall arrange things so that if pos-
sible my hand will act unconsciously to my
will and write what i discover though i
davis the soul am separate from it

  i fear the terrible end carry knew i
cannot will not become the ghastly thing
i saw last to avoid it i have tied myself
in this chair before the table a rope is
securely fastened under my arms and about

the chair so long as i have arms i cannot
fall

  should they vanish i have prepared live
wires from the attachments we have and
however i fall from this chair i will strike
them

  at least i shall be burned away before
that awful end overtakes me i am ready
now and will go by self-hypnosis

  it is made easy by the presence of carry
-if it is carry who helps me in my hand
is a pen i hope it writes on as i think

  i am going now going going-going
to sleep

here there was a break in the report
as  found it and read it in the
empty laboratory that morning after davis
had summoned me

  a large blot spread over the lower part
of the page and below it a few uncertain
lines ran slantwise down the page

  i could make nothing of them on the
next page letters appeared again faint
shaken letters misshapen and uneven but
legible i read on in giving the report
to the world i have thought best to rewrite
this latter part keeping to daviss own
words but copying for the sake of legi-
bility

  what he wrote seems to me more start-
ling more strange and possibly more ter-
rible than the discovery made by carry

  certainly it is less encouraging yet in
it are paragraphs of great hope bits of
inspired beauty as though the writer sang
of glorious things sublime truths and
marvelous places

  continuation of report

i stand beside my own body here
i can see the heavy blot where my
pen fell as i went to sleep looking into
my own face is a strange experience and
suggests something to me which i have
always suspected but now feel sure must
be true

  for years i have entertained the idea
that a mans appearance is directly related
to his soul it seems to me clear now for
fruit of the forbidden tree



i am an unbodied spirit and a new power
is mine i can observe my unfleshed self
as easily and as truly as i see my body
tied in the chair we resemble each other
only dimly yet there is something in the
transparent skin the even features and
the calm of that face that is due to my
soul and to nothing else

  the truth becomes more definite as i
recall carrys face i see now that he
looked in the flesh quite as the structure
of his soul compelled but where is he
i cannot see him although i was sure that
i should do so as soon as i was freed
from my material person

  another strange fact here deserves com-
ment before i state my exact position
in the realm of the super-conscious i can
control my body even though i am sepa-
rate from it the delicate psychic fibers
with which i operate that hand are clear
to me and there is something exalting in
the sense of power yet i am not happy
too much of mystery still shrouds the ac-
tivities of this night still pulsing like a
flaming artery through me is that dread
force that lights the laboratory with such
a weird glow

  worst of all the thoughts that i see pass
in my own head like shadows of flame is
the sudden realization that i am alone

  -wtiere is the great world of spirit i
stand here free unbodied-yet i am alone
and the four walls of the laboratory hold
me i must go on and up for rest is im-
possible while i am without the secret
of space that will enable me to find my
wife and carry

  i am moving now going slowly toward
the farthest wall and i find that those in-
visible soul tendons which manipulate my
writing hand stretch as i move they will
reach across all the space of the universe
and i am able to go where i will among
the stars-conscious that my body awaits
me alive under my control and well

  a great feeling of exhilaration swells
within me and i pass through the wall
easily i am master of the fourth dimen-
sion

  below me the sleeping city spreads an

infinite pattern of dark squares edged in
long lines of gleaming lights above th
star-filled sky smiles blue and calm i am
soaring into it

  since writing that preceding sentence a
long lapse of time has occurred to me it
seems eternal though i know it was but
a few seconds i am now in a form of con-
sciousness superior to man where i am
i do not know nor by what means i came
save that my will aided by that ever burn-
ing vital force has brought me here

  i hesitate to describe it fearful lest
the utter incredibility of the truth strikes
whoever reads and causes denial

  above all things let me warn against
negations they are the tragic soul crises
into which one goes to destruction as carry
went he denied the soul and i know now
that he is gone wiped out by the great
will-and even his spirit is extinct a waste
cinder floating somewhere in bottomless
chaos

  as for myself i am alive with a joy
that thrills me madly i shall succeed and
my gain will reward the world with truth

  i am a dancing whirling conscious
flame hotter than fire more brilliant than
light beautiful beyond words-and i leap
up from nothing to nothing like a great
burning tongue that lives without fuel not
even space or time contains me they lie
below me there in that petty universe
where my unsouled body writes at my com-
mand

  all the rare colors of the rainbow sum-
mer sunsets and the light-refracting dew
are thrown off by my dancing soul of heat
and gleam around me in an iridescent
sheen

  vague harmonies stir in the center of my
columned fire and i am stirred to infinite
yearnings now i am going higher higher
-and i change again the raging heat
diminishes my colors fade dear heaven
am i going out am i to end in nothing
like a fuelless spark

  no i am in a glory of extreme exalted
life i am the essence of music singing
great arias of pure melody

  i know not how to explain my being


famous fantastic mysteries

save to say that i am the very soul of har-
mony and everywhere about me tumultu-
ous chords in crashing volumes not audible
to the human ear ring vibrant through the
worlds and stir the stars to action fine
fabricated melodies weave in and out
among the thundrous bass and i am part
of it-conscious and alive like the very
inspiration of the universal hymn

  i must resort to figurative speech for no
words live that can portray the vital es-
sence of the music that is a spirit

  i am a moving sound glittering with
rare beauty and about me stars of chords
and planets of melody swing through a
sea of motion like dancing agonies of ec-
stasy this is the bliss of far-extended soul
and ahead of me i know god waits to re-
veal-himself the knowledge comes in
notes like cosmic flute tones and i swirl
on and on motion always motion and en-
ergy are the very deeps that guide even
as they were with carry-but how differ-
ent one thing is sure all things center
about movement and all things that are
conscious move t am motion that expresses
itself in pure umnaterial sound

  were i in the compass of the universe
we know i could say that i had gone mil-
lions upon millions of miles during the time
i described these two states of being but
i am outside time and space moving toward
god i am more definitely aware of him
now and there is a swift leap of yearning
that changes ever and again to movement

  movement grows more and more impor-
tant it is the essence of all things i have

left the realm of sound and am movemedt
energy-conscious and swirling i am force
itself

  a dreadful fear has crept into my mind
as i sweep on i have ceased to exist as a
form at all and am mere motion tearing
on and on while i swirl in a circle like a
tornado it is ghastly for i am not certain
of things now try as i may to attain the
ecstasy of a few minutes ago i fail de-
spair grows in larger and larger blackness
while i am diminishing that is tragic for
i have become a mere vortex ring a swirl-
ing circle of force that gyrates about a
vacuum i want to return to the laboratory
where i know my hand still moves at the
dictation of my will but it may stop soon

  i feel that giant-will trying to tear me
from my body it strikes at my will in an
attempt to paralyze me into destruction
i am mad with motion and-heaven help
me i am nearing that same dread feeling
carry knew i am mere fire mist con-
sciousness swimming in fire and a fire that
shivers with savage will rage and desire

  if you could imagine all the energy of
the world all the yearning of the human
race all the savagery of life from the be-
ginning become strong leaping dancing
sparks of anger-conscious fire then you
will know what has occurred to me i swim
in it desperately and there is no rest-no
salvation i shall go down in it and be
lost my body will be there or-i am mad
it will follow carry i see it all now i
too am lost to all

  oh the supreme folly of man we are

i talked with god

   yes i did - actually and literally

and ns a result of that little talk with god some
ten years ago a strange new power came into my
life after  years of horrible sickening dismal
failure this strange power brought to me a sense
of overwhelming victory and i have been overcom-
ing every undesirable condition of ray life ever since
what a change it was now-i have credit at more
than one bank i own a beautiful home drive a love-
ly car own a newspaper and a large office building
and my wife and family are amply provided for after
i leave for shores unknown in addition to these ma-
terial benefits t have a sweet peace in my life i am
happy as happy can be no circumstance ever upsets
me for i have learned how to draw upon the invisi-

ble god-law under any and all circumstances

  you too may find and use the same staggering
power of the god-law that i use it can bring to

a race of dreaming fools all the high
imaginative forces we have aspired to mas-
ter are our very mockeries i thought i
was attaining god my wife and the peace
of freed spirit instead i am battling ago-
nizingly for life in my body imagination
has been the curse of my days i laughed
at the glory of human life i aspired to con-
quer soul

  there was carry who denied and i saw
that he was gone as though he had never
been in my supreme egotism i warned
against negation i am wiser now for like
carry i have crossed the last great rim of
life and am beyond it at the heart of god

  i am sinking sinking to death of mind
in this fire and i pray only that my body
fall upon the electric wires in the labora-
tory soon that it too may vanish from
the world

  agonies are endured in a moment and
still i fight against the accursed savagery
of will that beats me down wait

  i am back in my body staring at the
sheets of written words i know remem-
bering carry that my eyes are not the
blue orbs of davis but ghastly fear-driven
flames soon i shall go out and the vibrat-
ing agony that beats in this room so wildly
will be avenged

  before that time i have one word to
write luckily i write instead of talk for
my words would be blundering and bestial

  i have been to the heart and i know the
soul is a part of god

  my arms are growing shorter heaven
have mercy-my skin is heavy coarse and
snakelike

here the report ended in a spreading
black smudge i studied it closely and
i found the top of three letters dimly vis-
ible above the blot while the lower part of
two others showed the letters were q
h z r f

  i need add very little for the purpose
of complete clarity the laboratory was
as  stated at the beginning empty when
i arrived and the door was locked the
key being on the inside i burst open the
door

  these later sheets lay on the table in a
disordered pile while a pen had fallen to
the floor where i found it beneath the table

  not a trace of either man was discover-
able save their hats which hung in a small
closet against one wall around a chair be-
fore the table wires were carefully ar-
ranged and i found by testing that they
were alive with great voltages of elec-
tricity

  upon the back of the chair a rope hung
it was tied in a circle passing between the
round pieces in the chair back

  a minute charred fragment of something
not organic lay beside the chair

   have investigated thoroughly and am
able to assert that since my two friends
left their apartment on the evening of
february third and entered the laboratory
they have not been seen nor heard of

  personally i have accepted their report
weirdly improbable as it seems for one
thing more supports their combined testi-
mony i examined the laboratory furniture
minutely as well as its walls floor and ceil-
ing all of them looked as though they
had been edged in a flame of unusual qual-
ity such as an unknown light might be
for all were marked with slight char that
was in odd ripples evenly rhythmic as
though the flame had leaped and throbbed
as it burned

  davis rails at imagination rather force-
fully in one brief sentence from my
knowledge of him it seems probable that
he intended to imply that carry was right
in denying the existence of the soul and
that his own experience was a mystical
prolongation of imagination in fields where
art operates

  i may be mistaken for it is equally
true that he was incapable by temperament
of disbelief in spiritual things perhaps his
statement means something never to be un-
derstood unless some other inquirer repeats
his experience with more success

  what value this report may be to sci-
ence is not clear to me for i am an artist
and not scientific i submit it with the hope
that the lives of my friends may not have
ended in vain

easily dash them in ruins upon the jagged
nucleus of the comet

  radiant comet ingraham had named
it for the spectroscope had shown it to be
rich in radium the universally used
starter for all atomic disintegration
processes a tiny speck of radium activated
the atomic motors of this very ship and
without radium the slender silver rods
which slowly fed into the bulky power
domes about them and above and below
ihem were inert and useless

  ingraham permitted himself a back-
ward glance to where durphees gross
form gasped for breath

  be there in fifteen minutes he said
jerkily struggling against the weight of
his own diaphragm

  durphee did not answer except to moan
and ingraham turned to his panel as the
image of the nucleus slowly enlarged on
the teletab crossing the graduations
marked thereon he plied the levers and
dials until their speed was well under
control

  he breathed a sigh of relief and un-
clasped the safety belt

  skillfully he permitted the ship to settle
until a slight jar proclaimed that they
had landed

  durphee lurched to his feet he was a
trifle taller than ingrahams five feet ten
and thicker about the waist durphee
looked older than his indulgence-sated
forty years and ingraham younger than
his thirty

  ingraham was the scientist who had dis-
covered the true nature of radiant comet
looping in a vast parabola around the sun
and already well on its way to the outer
spaces again

  it was situated well beyond the orbit
of saturn because of the delay in adapt-
ing an ordinary earth-to-moon ship for
this mad adventure

  but durphee had raised the money in
a last desperate gamble to recoup a wasted
fortune

  how much radium is there durphee
asked staring out of one of the thick
ports

the other man did not answer im-
mediately he also stared over the
strange landscape he saw a desolate in-
ferno they had landed on the side away
from the small brightly yellow sun and
looked upon night but not a true night
everywhere the rocks gave forth a light
faint and spectral a light too weak to dim
the unwinking stars but light enough
it would seem to allow a man to walk
over the sandy plain

  millions of tons of radium ingra-
ham said at last my spectroscopic
analysis-

  millions of tons exclaimed durphee
in a loud voice what are we waiting
for lets get going he made as if to
turn the handwheel that locked the oblong
door

  wait ingraham commanded sharp-
ly open that door and youre a dead
man and i am too put on this suit
he opened a locker and brought out a
single garment which included a helmet
and boots shod with lead it was a typical
space suit and durphee knew how to put
it on ingraham got one for himself

  notice the fine metal mesh almost like
chain mail ingraham explained over
the outside of the regular fabric that is
you might say a radiation screen activated
by a small oscillator in your pack
along with the respirator tank it will
protect you from the emanations which
would otherwise burn you up you see-
lets get going durphee insisted
millions of tons-

  dont be a hog ingraham cut in
coolly weve only room for a couple
hundred pounds of the stuff in our in-
sulated cases some of the stuff is pretty
thinly distributed we have to look for
the richest-say-for metallic radium if
we can find it

  all right come durphee begged he
slipped on the helmet sliding up the seal-
ing wedge his eyes glittered greedily back
of the vitrine face-plate

  ingraham slipped on his own helmet

  all in good time he said levelly
speaking into the inductance phone


famous fantastic mysteries

  this atmosphere is mostly helium
given off by the disintegration of the
radium sure that your respirator is work-
ing

  they opened the lock and the door
flung outward from the pressure of the
air within and their suits instantly in-
flated standing out firmly valving off a
little air they stepped out upon the surface
of the radiant comet they carried their
tools and instruments and a cylindrical
container for the radium

  although the possibility of meeting hos-
tile inhabitants was remote they carried
at their belts light little deionizer tubes
those deadly modern weapons that destroy
life by inducing a chemical change within
the body

  look back once in a while ingra-
ham cautioned keep an eye on the ship
we dont want to be marooned here on a
comet

  lets start picking the stuff up dur-
phee proposed staring about him

  richer ahead where those rocks crop
out

  they arrived at the designated place
after a long walk and here the levelness
of the sands was broken by a mad con-
fusion of splintered rock huge upended
masses and giant crystalline forms it
was a scene of malefic fairyland lighted
by radiance that streamed silently out
from every side overhead was the foggy
luminescence of the comets tail stretch-
ing out into infinity but it was cold and
unreal compared to the living light that
came from the rocks

  durphee gave a hoarse cry

  look look veins of it nuggets
im rich im rich

  not till we get it back to earth
ingraham reminded him

  durphee fell to his knees and snatched
up fragments of the dangerous heavy
metal fondling it holding it to the face-
plate of his helmet

  dont do that you fool ingraham
said do you want to go blind or crazy
drop it into the canister wrere going to
fill that and leave as fast as we can

both fell to work filling the can
with their incredible hoard durphee
almost tearful at the thought of leaving
so much of it ingraham sharply remind-
ing him that no man could use so much
wealth

  they nearly had enough when overhead
appeared a light at first it might have
been merely another star but soon it re-
solved itself as some object that was rap-
idly approaching them other lights ap-
peared fast growing

  in a few minutes the earthmen were
gazing up at the strangely beautiful be-
ings slowly circling about them at a dis-
tance of a few feet from their heads one
may imagine a multiplicity of diaphanous
ruffles like crumpled cellophane all aglow
with prismatic light of their own

  they were not wings those thin radiant
processes and yet they might have served
as fourth-dimensional models of butter-
flies they did not move at all and ap-
peared to have no part in sustaining them-
selves in the air they might have been
merely large absorption surfaces to absorb
and hold the radiant energy pulsating
everywhere on that comet

  a fittingly strange form of life in strange
surroundings thought ingraham looking
at them wonderingly and with apprecia-
tion of their beauty looking through
them he saw no body no nucleus merely
thin shimmering membranous matter

  hey listen came durphees sharp
voice in the receiver are those things
dangerous

  they dont seem to be unfriendly
well i dont like the looks of them
suddenly one of the radiant beings
ceased its movements hung as it were
helplessly in its shimmering membranes
a hole had appeared a hole through which
the cold stars showed quickly like a fire
eating through cloth the hole widened
spread through the complex ramifications
of its being it reached the tips of the
ruffles and went out the prismatic light
disappeared

  you fool ingraham tried to knock
the deionizer from durphees hand but
the radiant enemies

the heavy space suit hindered him and
another of the radiant creatures died and
yet another before ingraham wrenched
the tube from the others grasp like
glowing bubbles before a gale the visitors
swept upward and away and in a few
seconds there was no sign of them

  whats the matter with you durphee
growled stooping and resuming his ex-
cited mining operations

  those beautiful things why kill
them

 theyre no good	

  as i may have mentioned before
durphee youre a hog men like you
blasted the ancient moon dwellings out
of pure cussedness if you didnt care what
you destroyed you might have considered
that its dangerous to antagonize them-
get busy with this stuff durphee
snapped crossly as for them were well
rid of em

  dont be too sure i think theyre com-
ing back

  they were coming back sweeping up
on a long arc from some place a mile or
two across the plain they were sweeping
back like avenging fireflies hundreds of
them

  now were in for it ingraham said
angrily handing durphee his deionizer
wait till they attack

  will they attack durphee asked
with growing anxiety

  theyve got plenty of reason to
ingraham reminded him stand still

the radiant beings flung themselves
upon the earthmen in a frenzy of
movement it seemed that they must be
annihilated beneath the weight of that
attack but when it was over and they
recoiled the puzzled men realized that
they had hardly felt as much as a touch
the radiants hovered about uncertainly
as if undecided and made no further
hostile move

  thank goodness ingraham exclaimed
were immune to their offense its some
form of radiant discharge and our suits
protected us see theyre sluggish now

it may take them some time to regenerate
enough energy to attack us again

  the colors of the diaphanous multiple
ruffles were in fact dim lacking the living
fire they had owned before

  you mean they cant hurt us asked
durphee with returning courage

  it seems not

  then let em have it

  this time the weakened radiants
winked out in death almost instantly be-
fore durphees deionizer and the sur-
vivors fled precipitately

  you murdering fool ingraham raged
grabbing for the tube

  no you dont durphee replied back-
ing away warily not with me owning
half of a few billion dollars worth of
radium im taking no chances

  keep it then ingraham yielded with
disgust when theres plenty for both
of us why should i rob you

  they fell to work and in a few min-
utes the canister was full despite the
slight gravity on that comet it was all
the two of them could do to carry their
treasure when they arrived at the ship
they were both weary

  once inside they prepared to lock the
door and leave at once for the comet was
steadily carrying them away from the
earth with a word of warning to durphee
about handling radium unprotected ingra-
ham started to lock up and set the air
machine to working suddenly he gave a
cry

  theyve stolen our fuel rods
through the plate of durphees helmet
his face was ashen as he looked up the
slender silver rods were indeed missing

  its them unholy what-you-call-ems 
he gritted the thieving- he wallowed
in foul language

  keep your suit on ingraham warned
him briskly weve got to find those bars
or were marooned here forever well die
here you understand

  he added not without bitterness

  it seems those things are intelligent
if you hadnt been so quick to murder
them they might have been friendly to


famous fantastic mysteries

us i think they were friendly at first
  durphee tottered to the door

  wait ingraham called i think i
know where they come from they may
have taken the rods there

  the low cliffs stretched like the frozen
surf of a phosphorescent sea across tri
plain somewhere along that low line rr st
be the dwelling of the radiants ingraam
looked back once regretfully at the ship
there was no way of locking it fm the
outside for the builders had anticipated
the danger of being locked out by over-
sight now this precaution stood them in
ill stead but they must risk the chance
of having the ship tampered with again

  the cliffs were nearer than they seemed
fter a walk of about two miles the earth-
men arrived and skirted along their base
until they came to an opening in the
rock the interior was illuminated with
the same milky-white light and ingraham
went in

  follow me he instructed durphee
and dont use the tube unless you have
to

  they passed through a corridor for sev-
eral hundred feet and traveling down-
ward came to a lofty chamber three or
four hundred feet in diameter until then
they had seen none of the radiants but
now as if by signal thousands of them
appeared floating in the air over their
heads durphee pointed the deionizer at
them defensively but did not discharge
the weapon and the radiants hovered
apparently waiting for something
ingraham called excitedly

  look durphee in the center of the
room see on that round thing

around boss like the stump of an
enormous tree but crystalline in
character was in the center of the great
room through the transparent mineral
liquid flowing fires in all the colors of
the rainbow could be seen slowly ebbing
and flowing sending out streams of silent
color that bathed the lofty vaults and
arches like the long slow surges of a ground
swell but ingraham was looking at the

little bundle of silver rods lying on the
table-like rock-the stolen fuel bars

  swiftly he strode toward them durphee
following and as the earthmen approached
the light seemed to ebb while the radiants
retreated to the farthest extremities of
the room

  but as ingraham extended his hand and
took the silver rods a light as dazzling
as lightning and as overwhelming as a
geyser burst from the boss blinding him
nevertheless he took the rods and turn-
ing groped for durphee

  the latter was shielding his eyes with
his forearm

  what is it whats that light he
asked in alarm

  some powerful form of radiant en-
ergy ingraham replied ill bet those
things are wondering why we werent
killed our radiation screens saved us
lets get out and get back

  the great light ebbed and as the earth-
men turned to go the radiants reappeared
seemingly imbued with the greatest ex-
citement they whirled about their heads
with the fury of a tornado and durphee
laughed

  that for you firebugs wish i had
time id take your god or whatever that
thing is with me

  keep your tube in its clip ingraham
warned

  who in the devil are you- durphee
flared but he got no further a rock as
big as a mans fist toppled out of some
niche or cranny high overhead struck his
shoulder ripping out a triangular rent in
the mesh of the radiation screen covering
his space suit instantly one of the radi-
ants flung itself on the vulnerable spot
and clung there limpet-like a cry of des-
perate agony rung in ingrahams induction
phone

  help its burning me to death

  as durphee fell ingraham leaped for-
ward and caught the radiant in his clumsy
gauntlets he crumpled the gauzy ruffles
of its being as easily as paper and saw its
shimmering light go black under his hands
then before another of the creatures
the radiant enemies



could fasten itself on the place he lifted
back the torn flap and twisted the thin
wire ends together as well as he could

  can you stand now he asked

  durphee scrambled to his feet cursing
and groaning

  it burned the liver out of me he
muttered

  rocks were still raining about them as
if the radiants had just discovered by ac-
cident this primitive method of fighting
and were making the most of it

  suddenly ingraham struck on the head
fell to the ground

  he must have been unconscious only
for an instant for when he got to his
knees he could see durphee walking away
scarcely ten feet from him

  durphee he called but his partner
paid him no heed he had already entered
the corridor

  ingraham saw that his body was literally
covered with the radiants but the rock
had torn none of the protective screen
and he was impervious to their attack
reeling he rose to his feet brushing the
fragile beings from him and so followed
durphee raging with anger

  too cowardly to murder him the
avaricious durphee nevertheless was will-
ing to abandon him to death he thought
durphee was running and ingraham ran
alter him the radiants did not follow

just then durphee turned and saw
him in that uncertain light with the
handicap of the clumsy space suits ingra-
ham was not sure but he thought he saw
his partner start durphee spoke first

  close squeak he congratulated
thickly

  durphee ingraham asked coldly
did you see what happened to me

  i didnt see anything was durphees
sullen reply

  you didnt see me fall and keep go-
ing

  you had the fuel rods the other man
retorted what good would it do me to
leave you

  ingraham felt a sense of shame

  were both unstrung this unholy
place lead on durphee lets be on our
way

  their tracks in the luminous sand were
clear and pointed unmistakably to the
ship in less than an hour they were close
to the shiny ovoid durphee was the first
to reach it at the door he stopped and
waited for his partner to come up

  ingraham stepped beside him unsus-
pectingly in an instant durphee had
snatched the weapon out of the clip at
ingrahams belt and delivered a stagger-
ing blow to the solar plexus ingraham
went down and durphee fell on top of
him his weight on that small world was
not great but the shock of the fall
paralyzed ingrahams breathing

  something was thudding on the vitrine
face-plate of his helmet repeated blows
from the heel of durphees hand trying
to break the glass

 blind anger gave the under man
strength and in a fury of despair he struck
back at the muffled body of his betrayer
he clamped an arm around the others
neck only to have it painfully wrenched
free he took hold of the folds of
durphees space suit there was a metallic
rip as the insulating screen tore away but
durphee rolled free and staggered to his
feet

  ingraham tried to rise also but as he
did the glowing sand came up to meet
him he sprawled and the thud of a kick
in the ribs came to him only impersonally
he gave himself up for dead and before
his eyes the sand under the face-plate
glowed mockingly

  but ingraham was not dead with faint
surprise he came to that realization some
time later and immediately afterward the
freezing horror of his fate bore in upon
him marooned marooned on a comet
and speeding away from the sun-already
far beyond all past limits of human travel
and drifting remorselessly into the void
betrayed by the greed of a man to whom
he had unhesitatingly entrusted his life

  he lifted his body supporting it on his
hands and stared ahead of him wondering


famous fantastic mysteries

if he had overestimated the passage of
time for the ship was still there just as
it had been and the tracks in the sand
showed where durphee had stepped in
letting the door fall shut but a narrow
line showed that it had not yet been drawn
tight and locked from within the silver
fuel rods were gone

  with wild hope ingraham tottered to
the ship had durphee relented or was
he battening the cruel streak in him on
his victims despairing efforts

  ingraham felt for his deionizer it was
gone and was nowhere on the ground he
was still at durphees mercy then

  after many clumsy failures he managed
to insert the thick fingers of his space
gloves into the crack of the door quickly
he flung it open and stepped inside ready
to fight again for his life

  his first glance showed him that he
would not have to fight durphee his
partner lay at full length on the floor and
as ingraham came in ten or more radiants
rose from the prostrate body and hovered
in the air as if expectantly projecting
one might imagine a question

  there was no need to examine the

charred fabric of durphees space suit
where the radiants had fastened unde-
terred because the radiation screen was
torn durphee had paid in full

  fear lifted from the soul of ingraham
and shrouded it again as he saw the slender
bars suspended by some invisible force
beneath the bodies of the hovering radi-
ants-the silver fuel rods-the key to his
escape into a normal world

  a quick glance out of the corner of his
face-plate showed him that he had left
the door open and he knew beyond doubt
that before he could take one step his visi-
tors would be gone taking the rods with
them

  but even as that appalling truth sank
into him ingraham was thinking of the
prismatic beauty of these exquisite crea-
tures and as he did so something passed
between the earthman and the radiants
and something like a benediction and a
sense of understanding flowed from them
to him they drew together and light
streamed from one to another the silver
rods fell to the floor of the ship about
ingraham and swiftly the radiant beings
flew out of the door and were gone

famous fantastic mysteries s

  congratulations at last youve published the
magazine i have been waiting for and youve
done a mighty fine job at that my greatest
criticism is that you issue it only every other
month thats hardly being fair to your readers
however i feel sure the success you no doubt
will have will make it possible for you to give
us famous fantastic mysteries every month
in a short time the title is well chosen

  i hesitated to clip the coupon on the last
page because i want to save the magazine in-
tact-and i save very few magazines besides
the coupon hardly gave me space to say the
things i wanted to say

  its hard to select my favorite story almost
every one being far above the average the
moon pool karpen the jew the girl in
the golden atom and the witch-makers
all run a close race for first place the moon
pool having perhaps a slight edge on the
others all of these seem to follow closely the
suggestion implied by the magazines title al-
though the quality of mystery is somewhat lack-
ing in the girl in the golden atom

  space station no  seemed just another
science fiction story

 the whimpus and blind mans buff
also struck me as not being in strict keeping
with the title of famous fantastic mysteries
although the latter story was quite amusing
however i rather resented the humorous touch
in a magazine of this type if you must include
humor please hold it down to a single story
each month

  in regard to the type of story id like to see
in future issues i suggest that you stick to ones
like the witch-makers the moon pool
and karpen the jew these tales are definitely
unusual and well in keeping with the magazines
title exclude stories the likes of which we can
find in a dozen or more other publications in
short give us the stuff thats hard to find else-
where

  whatever you do dont change the cover as
it is now it adds a great deal of character to the
appearance of the magazine character that
would be considerably lessened should you re-
sort to a pictorial cover then the magazine
would become just another fantastic fiction pub-
lication instead of something new and refresh-
ingly different

  as you see my criticisms are few famous

fantastic mysteries give me exactly what
ive been waiting for i think youve done a
grand job keep your magazine on the same
high level of quality and ill remain a most
devoted reader

not to kill time

  although i am not given to writing to maga-
zine editors usually i feel strongly moved to
give my two-cents worth concerning your new
magazine famous fantastic mysteries

  it is my opinion that you are doing us science-
fiction readers a real service and answering a
long felt need in producing this magazine cer-
tainly although science-fiction stories are new
compared to the art of story-telling as old
as man there are by now a number of real
classics in this field and what could be better
than that we readers may read the select
material 

  i do not read them just to kill time but to
supply the mental diversion from cold realism
therefore i am constantly searching for higher
type stories i believe your new magazine will
fill this need and you may count upon me as a
permanent reader

  good luck to you

suggestion for future series

and wish to congratulate you upon your achieve-

closely followed by the others all were good
and you are to be commended for your selection

  as a suggestion for future issues please print

famous fantastic mysteries

print one complete novel

  after reading your new magazine famous
fantastic mysteries i cannot describe how
thoroughly  endorse it to find a magazine
printing just one story like the moon pool
i would consider a stroke of luck but to have
the moon pool amongst stories like cum-
mings the girl in the golden atom which
i waited for many years and others just as
good-well it was a stroke of genius

  couldnt you print one complete long novel
or if that is impossible print the longer novels
in parts need i say that we want the sequel
to both the moon pool conquest of the
moon pool by merritt and the girl in the
golden atom the princess of the atom
by cummings and please print brand new
world also by ray cummings

  again i say well done and in the same breath
-give us more of the same

something  hoped for

  congratulations and i mean it this maga-
zine is something i had hoped for for a long
time lets see it was about  i think that
i gave up reading science fiction while still
keeping my collection intact but then i
happened to pick up a copy of george allan
englands darkness and dawn well here
was real stuff no i wasnt jaded but only
tired of mass-production science fiction there-
fore i welcome the new magazine with wide
open arms

  i hope you wont confine the stories to shorts
since some of the best tales have been serial
length and please do not use for the present
those that are still available in book form my
suggestions follow

  of course the sequels to the moon pool
and golden atom ralph milne farleys

trilogy the radio man radio beasts
radio planet j u giesys triology palos
of the dog star pack mouthpiece of zitu
jason son of jason merritts metal mon-
ster three lines of old french through
the dragon glass garrett p serviss moon
maiden conquest of mars conquest of the
moon george allan englands darkness and
dawn h e flint the planeteer queen
of life man in the moon etc austin halls
into the infinite rebel soul almost im-
mortal flint and halls blind spot garret
smiths after a million years

knows his fantastics

  i have just purchased the first issue of
famous fantastic mysteries i have not read
it for it happens that i have already read and
have in my possession every story in the maga-
zine you see i am a fantasy fan and collector

ill buy every issue of ffm you put out

  i think your selection of stories for the first
issue is excellent some readers will be disap-
pointed as i was to discover that the moon
pool is only the novelette which precedes the
real story obviously youll have to publish
the conquest of the moon pool the same
thought applies to the girl in the golden
atom and its sequel the people of the
golden atom these are serials long ones-
yet they are the classics which the fantasy
readers have been so anxious to read more of
that a bit later

  the other stories are well chosen karpen
the jew by leath and the whimpus by
robbins are striking stories giesys blind
mans buff is a humorous note which might
well round out every issue yvandreis and well-
mans yarns i think are too new but they are
good stories nevertheless

  as for future issues you have an almost in-
exhaustible source of material from which to
draw but-the long stories are the stories you
should feature  the blind spot by austin
hall and homer eon flint and its sequel the
spot of life    j u giesys triology palos
of the dog star pack the mouthpiece of
zitu and jason son of jason    george
allan englands novels the empire in the
air darkness and dawn beyond the great
oblivion the afterglow the golden
blight the fatal gift etc    homer eon
flints yarns the planeteer the king of
conserve island the lord of death the
queen of life the devolutionist the
emancipatrix the man in the moon and
out of the moon    charles b stilsons
polaris-of the snows minos of sardanes
and polaris and the goddess glorian

wants cover illustrated

 i want to thank you for making these great
 fantasies available in your new magazine

 i was always under the impression that mer-
 ritts the moon pool was a book-length
 novel instead of a novelette the ending seemed
 to suggest that there is more than you published
 how about it otherwise the story was all i
 heard about it other prize winners robbins
 the whimpus and cummings the girl in
 the golden atom

 suggested for future publication the blind
 spot the planet of peril the radio
 man and the rest of farleys radio series
 the queen of life and the lord of death
 both by homer eon flint

 t would also like to see the cover illustrated

golden atom best

 i think you have an excellent magazine here
 the first issue was perfect and it hit upon all
 my weaknesses with its variety of stories

 the girl in the golden atom by ray cum-
 mings was the best i have ever read personally
 i think you should use many more like it and
 occasionally change off to stories like the
 whimpus by todd robbins

wants very old classics

  congratulations on a fine magazine the idea
behind famous fantastic mysteries is splen-
did-even if the title is not the stories in the
sept-oct issue were all excellent reading as
a science fiction enthusiast i would naturally
like to see the classic type of story predominate
-though whether it is a merritt type with
plenty of imagination or a story like wellmans
more rigidly scientific i do not care the super-
natural stories are ok but only in small doses

  all in all the magazine is a very good one
but i have a few criticisms and suggestions to
offer in the first place stories as recent as
 should not be used why not make 
the limit

  secondly id like to see the magazine pub-
lished monthly

  thirdly and this is most important please
use some serials titles like the metal mon-
ster the radio series

  in any event im looking forward to the next
issue
