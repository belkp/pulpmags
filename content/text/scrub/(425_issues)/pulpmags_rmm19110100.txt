the funny side of railroading

by walter gardner seaver

a brace of boes that were watered out-why bob rogers drifted far
away from texas - how john kept losing
his tail

turn is it to speil
to-day 

 dempseys

 youve got the
highball dempsey
hook her up and
pull her wide open youve got nothing
against you

   on the burlington lines out of old
st joe some funny things happened
said dempsey

  dave winton was superintendent of
the kansas city st joe and council
bluffs then and mike hohl was chief
despatches there was a gang of toughs
in the town known as the dillon gang
they used to run amuck whenever the
notion took them for a time there was
hardly a pay-day diat the dillons didnt
lay for some of the railroad boys and
winton almost invariably had a crowd
on the carpet in consequence

   the dillon crowd was feared by
everybody it used to be a saying that
when the dillons broke loose the police
force went to investigating vacant lots
where the weeds grew thick and tall so
that the dillons wouldnt come against
them

  for some reason winton always came
down hard on the railroaders that mixed
it up with the dillon crowd and more

than one poor devil was let out without a
clearance for no other reason than that he
had been in a scrap with the dillon outfit

as if he had been shot from a catapult


the railroad mans magazine

   p h houlahan was with the hannibal
and st joe being trainmaster at brook-
field whenever any of the hannibal boys
got mixed up with the dillons they were up
on die carpet of course but houlahan al-
ways stood by the railroaders and so far as
i know no hannibal man was ever let out
or even laid off for ten days because he
mixed it up with that crowd

   but what i want to tell about is a wreck
that occurred in the nairows between st
joe and atchison winton was a portly
man and was usually inclined to be rather
dignified

   he was seated in an armchair beside the
open side door of the way car with his feet
elevated and resting against the jamb of the
door and sound asleep

   suddenly he was shot out of the door
and went tumbling down the bank among
the ragweed which had grown to a height
of five or six feet before he was fairly
awakened he had managed to get his feet
and legs so tangled up in the weeds that
every time he attempted to rise he would get
entangled worse and worse

   when the boys saw that he was not hurt
they could not refrain from giving vent to
their hilarity and it was some time before
they could turn their attention to the condi-
tion of the wreck when winton finally got
loose and came up the bank with his face
and clothes all yellow from the bloom of the
ragweed they suddenly became very seri-
ous when he finally got to the top of the
bank one and all were very earnestly in-
specting the wreckage

   whether it was because of a broken or
defective flange on one of the wheels or for
some other reason the trailing truck under
a box car failed to follow the lead of the
front one and climbed the frog about half
die train had followed the engine onto the
siding but the rest of the cars were dis-
tributed over the landscape with the excep-
tion of the way-car and two cars ahead of it
which did not leave the rails the sudden
jerk as the cars left the iron had shot win-
ton through the open door as if he had been
hurled from a catapult

  what have we struck he yelled as
he glided into the atmosphere

  ever- man in the crew got thirty days
winton said it was because we laughed at
him

  sam wadsworth served through the
civil war he was a captain in the union

army and was wounded by a minie-ball
striking him in the head at the battle of
white river arkansas he was wounded
on the morning of july  and for a time his

there was hardly a pay-day that the-

railroad-

life was despaired of however he got well
-and the fourth of july was always a great
day for him

   it was sams day to howl not even the
president of the united states could induce
him to do a tap of work on that day no
matter where he was he did not fail to have
a liberal supply of fireworks oh he made
a noise all right christmas and new
years were nothing to him when compared
to the fourth of july

    after the war sam went into the service
of the hannibal and st joe and for a time
ran a freight between brookfield and quin-
cy afterward he was given a passenger
run between quincy and st joseph this
was before the line was opened from cam-
eron to kansas city

  one day just as sam was leaving the
house to go to the yard to take out his train
to quincy a couple of tramps asked if they
could have something to eat they claimed
to have been in the war and since that time
had been drifting about the country seeking
employment

   as there were hundreds of men in the
the funny side of railroading



-dillons didnt lay for some of the
-boys

same predicament at that time nothing was
thought about it any man who claimed to
be an ex-soldier did not have to ask sam
wadsworth the second time for assistance
but these two men did not know that and
the elder of the two began a hard-luck story
that his comrade had iost his speech owing
to a wound in the throat and the scar of a
gun-shot wound on the neck was corrobo-
ration

   sam did not care anything about this
the fact that they were ex-soldiers was
sufficient he took the men to the house
and told his wife to give them food then
he hustled off to the yard

  will craig his brother-in-law though
only a youth at the time was braking ahead
for him while his brother dan craig was
a little fellow and was at the house when
the tramps were seated at the table

    while they were eating and when nearly
through the east-bound freight from st
joseph pulled in this was the train that
wad was to take out and there was upward
of an hour yet to be used in the yard before
she pulled out

   the tramps did not know this however
and as the train whirled by the house the
dumb man shouted

    hully gee tom we must make that
train 

   they rushed out and down into the
yard this was evidently a ruse to get
away before they could be asked to cut some
stove-wood in payment for the meal a course
that was customary among missouri matrons
at that time

   dan craig thought that the sudden re-
covery of speech by the dumb man was
nothing short of a miracle thinking that
sam would be pleased to hear of the good
luck that had come to the tramp soldier he
hastened to the depot where he found wad
book in hand slowly pacing along the train
entering the car initials and numbers

  when wad heard the story he simply
said humph the miraculous feature
of the matter did not strike him as forcibly
as it had dan he told the boy that it was
all right and that he was glad to hear it
and went on with his work

   soon after he spotted his table-guests
sneaking along through the yard and called
will craigs attention to them

   let them stow away said wad  and
when we gt out on the road i will have
some fun with them

   they kept an eye on the two men and
just as the train was about to pull out saw
them climb in the end window of a -car
loaded with lumber will soon spotted the
place where they had hid themselves

   this train stopped only at macon shel-
bina and palmyra junction at macon
craig saw a thin wisp of smoke curling out
of the end window of the tramps car stand-
ing astride the two cars he called out

    sam theres a fire in this car of lum-
ber pass up a few buckets of water

   as the water was passed up he deluged
the inside of the car-one bucket to the
right the next to the left and the third to
the center the tramps caught every drop
for the space where they were stowed away
was scarcely large enough to hold two men

   the third bucketful was too much and
one of them called out

cheese it cully well come out 

   they came out a more wobegone for-
lorn pair of hoboes had never been seen
both were thoroughly soaked

  holy smoke said craig dont
you fellows know better than to stow avvav
in such a place that lumber is liable to


the railroad mans magazine

shift at any jerk of the engine and flatten
you out as thin as a pancake where are
you going 

  they said that they were going to chi-
cago and told their hard-luck story craig
appeared to be much impressed and said

    i only go as far as quincy but so far
as i am concerned you are welcome to ride
only you must come out and ride on top
but be careful that the con dont see you
when the engineer shuts her off and squeals
for brakes you shin down the ladder on the
side opposite to the station and hit the grit
get into the weeds and lie low until the
train starts again then get back on top

    it did not occur to either of the tramps
that the con from his lookout-seat in the
cupola could see over the top of the train
craig made them go forward to the car right
back of the engine in those days of bal-
loon stacks engines threw dense volumes of
black smoke while a steady shower of cin-
ders was sure to rain over the forward cars

   wet and shivering the two hoboes hung
to the running-board swallowed smoke and
chewed cinders without a murmur while
craig who was riding in the cab and wad
who was watching them from the cupola
had a matinee performance which they never
forgot	

    at shelbina the depot was in the center
of the town with a small park on either side
and there were no weeds so the hoboes had
to get down in full view of the stores and
business houses that lined the opposite side
of the square

  they were game however when the
train started they made a run for the side-
ladders of the way-car somebody yelled
at them and they scrambled all the faster

  the engineer pulled the throttle wide
open and by the time the men grabbed the
hand-holds the train was going at a pretty
good clip they had all they wanted to do
hanging on but they managed to pull them-
selves up and flopped on the roof grabbing
the running-board for dear life

  at palmyra junction the train stopped
a moment for orders when it started the
tramps were kept moving pretty lively to
avoid being ditched shortly after leaving
palmyra junction the road strikes the south
bank of the south fabius river and runs
along this to a point near its junction with
the mississippi river not far from the west
end of the bridge as the train swung
around a curve a link on the third car from
the engine broke and the engine and the

three cars jumped ahead as though shot out
of a gun

    the tramps were shot off they clutched
frantically at the smooth tin roof but fail-
ing to secure -any hold were gracefully
dumped into the mud at the edge of the
creek the fabius had just recovered from
one of its periodical attacks of high water
and a bed of mud about the consistency of
mush and as black as tar bordered the
stream into this soft bed the two plumped
clear up to their shoulders craig looked
back and the fireman leaned from the gang-
way in an effort to see what had become of
them they could not stop it was up to
the front end now to keep away from the
rest of the train

   the middle and rear brakeman had
hustled out on top as soon as they felt the
jolt that told them the train had parted
and were busy setting brakes to hold her
down the hill but wad had kept his eye
on them and as the way-car passed he saw
them scrambling out of the mud

    they knew enough to wave us good-
by said wad

   will craig too had a heart in him as
big as an ox when he was in the yards
at argentine kansas there was more than
one railroader out of a job who had reason
to remember him twenty years ago there
was more or less drifting about of railroad-
ers especially switchmen and brakemen
traffic would fall off the number of trains
would be reduced and as a consequence a
number of men would be let out or laid off
until business picked up again

   a number of unmarried men would take
advantage of this to change their location
they had their clearances which were suffi-
cient to enable them to get over any road
and also to get in line for work whenever
opportunity offered

   once a brakeman named bob rogers
struck argentine dead broke and pretty well
all in he had traveled around in search
of employment until his funds were exhaust-
ed he ran against craig who saw that he
had a boarding-place and was made com-
fortable about ten days afterward he
caught a run on the missouri pacific out of
armourdale

  i had drifted down into texas he
said to craig  as i had always been anxious
to see that country and as there was con-
siderable new mileage under way i thought
the outlook for getting set up there was
much better than back here in the east i
the funny side of railroading



got a run on the espee out of san antonio
and had em coming nicely until a little
more than a month ago then i began to
get into it proper

     we pulled out one morning with a lot
of empty stock-cars bound west the day
was fine-just after a rain-and i was sit-
ting on a brake-wheel two or three cars
back of the engine taking it easy we were
near hondo and as we were not scheduled
for any stop east of uvalde where we had
a meeting-point i was taking considerable
enjoyment out of the ride

     suddenly i heard the engineer squeal-
ing for live stock but as we had that every
two or three miles i was not paying much
attention i knew that if that old hog
mixed it up with any steers the steers would
get the worst of it

    suddenly i shot from my seat and
sailed gracefully through the air landing
head first in some al soft sticky mud at
the bottom of a little arroyo the cars
were strung out all over the landscape and
the old hog which i had thought immune
from any cattle ailment lay on her side in
the ditch groaning her life out

    her crew had promptly gone over-
board and they too had landed in the soft
mud in the arroyo but unlike me they lit
feet first and came up un-
hurt the way-car and per-
haps a third of the train
had not left the rails the
con and the middle and rear
brakeman came hustling
ahead to see about the dead
and wounded

   i had got straightened
up and witli the engineer
and fireman they proceeded
to indulge in an outburst of
glee every time i moved or
attempted to speak i im-
agine that i must have been
a sight and i am dead cer-
tain that if i had been in
their place and some other poor devil in my
shoes i would have laughed too

  well they got out flags and the con
proceeded to toddle off down the track to
hondo to report the wreck while the rest of
us proceeded to make an investigation as to
the cause of our ground and lofty tumbling

  a bunch of steers had been on the
right-of-way and all had been scared off by
the whistle the engineer had just pulled
her wide open and was hitting em up

again

       when one stupid steer took a notion
that he could outrun that hog and so swung
onto the track again

    the steer was galloping down the track
right between the rails in that graceful way
that a texas steer moves until he came to
the trestle that spanned the little arroyo
when down goes his forelegs between two
ties

   as soon as he saw the steer swing onto
the track hank shut her off and slammed
on the air but not quick enough to avoid
hitting the steer the old hog carved that
steer into hamburger steak but in doing so
lifted her trucks climbed the rail and
turned over easily on her side

the fabius had just recovered from one of its
periodical attacks of high water

     well we got out of that nviss all right
and two days afterward we were going east
with a heavy train of cattle there was a
little short spur-track just outside of san
antonio just about long enough to hold two
box-cars hank had em coming right along
in fine style when we went plump into that
spur-track

    somebody had either left the switch
open or unlocked and it had sprung at
any rate we headed in there going at a


the railroad mans magazine

thirty-mile-an-hour clip the engine struck
the bank used as a bumper i was standing
in the gangway and when she stopped and
turned over i just kept on going plowing up
the texas soil with my right shoulder for
something less than a half-mile

  - hank was caught when the deck-plate
doubled up his right was badly jammed
the fireman had attempted to get off but
was caught by the tank and injured this
should have been enough for me but i only
laid off one trip and then went out on my
run

    everything went smoothly we were
clipping along near hondo and i was think-
ing of the funny picture i must have pre-
sented as i climbed out of the mud when
i suddenly got right off that brakewheel and
took another trip through the air

   when i came to my senses and began
to take stock i found myself sitting astride
a side of dressed beef down in that same
arroyo while carefully turned upside down
over me as if to preserve me from accident
was a forty-ton gondola with the ends rest-
ing on either bank

something about sally in our alley

    luckily the gondola was empty when
she turned turtle over me and i managed to
crawl out unhurt

  investigation showed that a truck had
jumped from under a refrigerator-car loaded
with dressed beef and it proceeded to strew
the rest of the train over the texas prairie
when i got out the middle shack was sit-
ting on the side of an overturned box-car
singing in a thin strained tenor something
about  sally in our alley he wasnt
nutty it was just his optimistic way of
looking at things

     it was the engineer this time who tod-
dled on down to hondo to report the acci-
dent while the fireman and i flagged the
wreck

     when the wreck-train came up i left
them to manipulate affairs and paddled on
down to hondo myself i got back to san-
tone on the first train and didnt lose any
time in drawing my time and turning in
my keys

   thought that when i got pitched off
a train three times inside of a week it was
a pretty clear hint to me that i wasnt wanted
on the espee so i hooked
her down in the corner gate
her a full throttle and hit
the track on my way north
 sam wadsworth once
came into the hannibal
yard at st joe with a
through train of fast freight
from quincy no cars had
been picked up or set out
along the line among oth-
ers was a car-load of dry-
goods cases wad had re-
ceived this car at brook-
field sealed with the chicago
seal

  for some reason there
was a particular hurry on
the part of the consignee for
the contents of this particu-
lar car so it had hardly
been set out on the siding
than a lot of teams were on
hand to unload it

   as luck would have it
the car was standing almost
opposite the dog-house the
hannibal and st joseph de-
pot at that time was at the
corner of eighth and olive
streets and the roundhouse
was about four blocks far-
the funny side of railroading



ther south-just below what would be
mitchell avenue if that street had been
opened across the yards

   consequently the throat of the yard was
just east of the roundhouse lying between it
and eighth street and just below mitchell
avenue so the doghouse which was an
old box-car that had lost its trucks stood
almost on the south line of mitchell avenue
and not far from the roundhouse

  when the car was opened the men were
startled to hear the whine of a dog a mo-
ment later the mr dog came limping out
from among those cases and his left hind
leg was pretty lame he was very thin and
as craig said he had to lean up against the
side of the doghouse when he wanted to
stand up

  when the dog was lifted out and set
upon the ground he at once singled out
craig as the most likely one of the crowd to
yield to canine blandishments craig took
him into the doghouse shared his lunch with
him and then having gained the animals
confidence the gang crowded around to ex-
amine into his injuries

   it was found that the dogs leg was
broken probably by reason of having been
jammed between two of the cases

   the broken limb was washed the bona
set and splints made from an old cigar-box
were applied and the whole bandaged with
an old discarded red flag

   he was certainly about the most dis-
reputable-looking dog that ever came down
the pike he seemed to be as far as blood
was concerned a mixture of irish setter
mastiff yellow hound and coach dog his
left ear drooped sorrowfully and was about
half gone apparently having been chewed
off in a fight

   his right ear was worn cocked up as
though he was determined to hear all that
was going on his face and nose were white
with the exception of a black patch that sur-
rounded his left eye giving him the appear-
ance at a little distance of having had that
optic effectually blackened at some time

   there was not much hair on his head
which was covered with scars his tail at
one time had been broken and the latter half
of it hung at an angle of about forty-five
degrees from the upper half his body
too was covered with scars

   he had originally been spotted with
three colors-black tan and white

  he was the living exemplification of
hard luck

vyn

just how that dog knew a
railroader was a puzzle


the railroad mans magazine

    he at once attached himself to the dog-
house craig was his particular protege
craig could drop his coat and lunch-kettle
anywhere in the yard in sight of that dog
and then-let any one but craig touch it if
they dared

  the boys dubbed him john and he
answered the name readily he constituted
himself the guardian of that doghouse and
any railroad man no matter if a stranger
whether clad in greasy overalls and blouse
or wearing his glad rags who showed up at
the doghouse was all right with john

   any one not a railroader however was
kept at bay until some of the railroaders
appeared

    just how that dog knew a railroader was
a puzzle but he did and he never made a
mistake he had one bad habit which none
of the boys could break him of he would
go to sleep under a car one day a string
of boxes were kicked in on a track on which
some empties were standing john was
asleep under one of these empties the tip
of his tail lay upon the rail when the
boxes were kicked in they drove the empties
a few feet ahead and off went four inches
of johns caudal adornment

    john raised his voice in protest and the
boys came running from every direction
the dog was running in a circle howling
and snapping

    when the boys did finally get him quiet-
ed down they tenderly washed the bloody
stump placed a bunch of oily waste from the
dope bucket over it by way of salve and
bound it with scraps torn from an old shirt
in due time the wound healed up and the
boys thought it would be a lesson that john
would not forget

   but john was perverse and obstinate
no place was so good for sleeping purposes
as the center of the track under a car it
had not been more than two months since
the first amputation until the operation was

repeated this time a bigger slice went
the tail was now cut off almost to the
broken joint leaving only about an inch so
that it gave him the appearance of having
the tip end of his tail hooked down to catch
something-

   one would naturally think that john
would learn by experience and keep away
from the cars but no in less than three
months he had undergone another amputa-
tion in the same manner this time the re-
morseless wheels left him only about two
inches of tail

  after the wound had healed he would
wag that stump more vigorously than he had
ever before wagged his whole tail and the
boys finally decided-and they came to be-
lieve it firmly-that john did not like his
hooked appendage and had deliberately set
about its amputation it was only by rea-
son of his deficiency in gaging distance that
he had to take three whacks at it

   be that as it may john exercised more
discretion thereafter in his choice of sleep-
ing-places when he felt inclined for a
nap he would select the shade of a box-car
but invariably outside the rails

    john was a fixture in the hannibal yard
for a number of years and finally met death
gallantly craig had swung up into the
gangway of a passing switch-engine john
attempted to follow him john had jumped
off and on moving switch-engines scores of
times before this time he miscalculated
his jump poor fellow and landed across the
rail

    the tender-wheels passed over him

   john was buried on the bank of lini-
ment creek close to the junction of eighth
street and mitchell avenue the boys
thought he would be allowed to sleep there
undisturbed but when the union depot was
built and the sewer took the place of the old
bed of liniment creek johns bones were
disinterred by the graders and carted away

              the particular revenge that was meted
              out to legs brown and how it ended

gain there was quiet on the
hillside the construction-
crew was gone leaving the
long gash where ran the
rails of the newly com-
pleted road as the only me-
mento of their presence venturesome chip-
munks ran hither and thither along the
ties volubly chattering their impressions of
the phenomena to whoever would listen

  the woodland creatures had resumed
their normal lives that is most of them
had around a sarvas-berry thicket flut-
tered a pair of wild canaries chirping
distressfully evidently fearing for the
safety of their nest something unusual
was concealed in the bushes

  presently following a violent agitation
of the leaves on one side a large foot ap-
peared upheld by a long hairy shank
around which swarmed a cloud of mos-
quitoes after waving uncertainly for a
moment the foot was drawn back and there
issued forth an individual red of visage
with blue eyes that laughed and a figure
that was scarcely more rotund than a walk-
ing-stick the birds need not have feared

  it was legs brown-he of the sandville
incident and the melrose wreck wherein he
had pursued the wreckers on ostrich-back
and  j caught them now he was en-
gaged in secret service for the company

he hoped to stop the depredations of the
indians who resented the encroachment of
the railroad on their lands

  below him was the village of the red

s

man there were a few neat houses here
and there but the greater number of dwell-
ings were dirty gray teepees surrounded by
a profusion of soiled children and yelping
dogs the primitive american is not noted
for his industry given enough to eat
and drink he is never relentless in the
pursuit of higher culture

  out on the bay a slight breeze rippled
the waves and gently rocked the scattered
canoes in which a few somnolent indians
were fishing

  the ex-brakeman yawning and stretch-
ing himself shouldered his rifle and moved
stealthily into the underbrush an ordi-
nary person might have walked directly
into the village but brown was a detective
and had his own conception of the methods
followed by gentlemen in that profession

   this seems to be a hos-tile country all
right he remarked stopping to chastise a
predatory ant who had attacked his nether
limb even the bugs wanta chew offn
me but on stanley on the night ap-
proacheth

  a few steps farther however he halted
again his breath coming hurriedly with
a strange tightening of the scalp that caused
his hair to bristle from somewhere at his
right came a plaintive voice

  no no johnny dont make me go on
dont it hurts when i talk about it
leave th ol man alone i aint never
done nothin to you all

  then came another voice low yet threat-
ening


the railroad mans magazine

  bill who killed pietro

 yah who did snarled the first
speaker a note of defiance in his tone
 me choked him till his eyes stuck out
he had it coinin johnny he did but he
aint satisfied with that he hants me
him an his crowd o hell-hounds wont let
th olr man sleep at night why nobody
cud sleep with a whole roomful of em
gogglin an rattlin their jaws i cud stand
everything else if theyd stop rattlin their
jaws 

   brown moving softly through the thicket
found an old tumbledown shack from which
came the voices no longer caring to play
the re of eavesdropper he thrust open the
door with his foot and peered in

  of the two occupants one was an ap-
parently half-witted old man in a frenzy
of terror at his own recital the other
was a young indian beady-eyed and bru-
tal-featured with long coarse hair that
served to lubricate his coat-collar at the
interruption he seized his shotgun and
covered the intruder before brown had ac-
customed his eyes to the half light

  git out he commanded laconically
how dye do replied brown grin-
ning broadly

  you no go i shoot

  you seem to be a man of infinite jest
horatio as the feller says but say kid
put er up i feel like im going to climb
you if you dont an youll git all mussed
gazing steadfastly at the other he ad-
vanced until the point of the gun was al-
most touching him

 for the last tune-put up that gun 
the indian returned the look his own
eyes gleaming hate then his grip slowly
relaxed and the weapon slid to the floor
its owner cowed by a superior will

  havin a little vaudeville all by your-
self i see by gosh it takes a low-down
siwash to get any fun out of torturin a
poor old lunatic you drive out o here
and dont come hack or youll git cleaned
the indian sullenly obeyed

  turning to the old man brown said
if that animile comes pesticatin around
here any more uncle noahy let me know
ill be down at the camp a few days
yes suh-yes suh much obleeged
mumbled the patriarch

   dont know but what johnnyll git
singed anyways ef he keeps monkeyin
with that there giant powder blowed up
he he yes suh blowed up

  whats that asked brown sharply
but the aged imbecile was already prat-
tling vacuously repeated questioning
failed to elicit more information on the
subject giving up hope brown started
down the rocky hillside his mind busy with
conjecture as to why the indian should
have use for explosives and if the answer
would not bring him very close to the object
of his own mission

  unexpectedly brought out of his musing
by a slight sound in the rear he turned
and threw up his arm barely in time to
stop something that came writhing and
hissing through the air

  before he apprehended the nature of his
peril a full-grown rattlesnake was coiling
around his arm already the rattles were
humming their song of death when with
his left hand he seized the still dazed rep-
tile by the neck and tore it free

  grasping the tail he released the neck
and with a quick motion snapped off its
head without a -moments hesitation
brown charged up the hill in the direction
from whence the strange missile had come
but all was quiet search as he would he
could find no trace of the enemy

  swearing softly to himself he returned
to where he had thrown the dead snake

   thats a fine large specimen to be
slingin at a man seven rattles and a
button aha what might this be
secured to the body by a piece of cord
was a scrap of soiled paper hastily un-
folding it he read these words written in
a scarcely legible scrawl you ar to
smart lok out for the doth tide

   seems to be a communication yea
bo if i see one of them things ill throw
m hat at it

  carefully placing the note inside his
shirt he hastened on his way to the vil-
lage one house standing apart from the
others impressed him with its appearance
of cleanliness and general respectability
seeming to hold aloof from its humbler
neighbors he decided to seek lodging
there for the night when the door opened
in answer to his knock brown in the act
of taking off his hat stopped and stared

  instead of a dull-faced indian woman
as he had expected he saw a filing
brown-eyed girl neatly clad in a blue
calico dress her shapely arms bare to the
elbow she had the exquisite complexion
that is peculiar to those in whom there is
a tinge of indian blood
the death tide



   after a certain amount of stuttering the
 wanderer contrived to make known his de-
 sire

   yes i think you can stay father
wont be home until late but he never re-
fuses to take in strangers

   his entrance into that house marked a
change in brown whether consciously or
otherwise there exists in the imagination
of every man the image of his ideal mate
only in such degree as she conforms to this
ideal can a woman command his affection
dimly brown felt that in louise allen
he saw his dream-woman materialized and
he was glad

   he wondered if he had aroused similar
emotions in her but taking a mental in-
ventory of his own charms-huge hands
and feet bullet-head and stubbly hair-
he decided that he had not and cursed the
fate that had made him however there
was one asset of which he was unaware
about him was the air of sturdy manhood
conscious strength and self-reliance that
the railroad breeds in its workers pos-
sessing this a man needs little other recom-
mendation to the favor of a truly feminine
woman

   frankly he told her why he had come
and asked for such information as she
could give

  why mr brown she laughed
 youre trying to make me betray my own
people

   no sir-ee he responded gallantly
 you aint no more of a savage than i
am

   my mother was a quarter-breed and
my great-grandmother was a full-blooded
indian so you see im very much a sav-
age

   well dang it-or-blame it i mean

 i	like savages anyway

   thank you but seriously i have
heard some rumors of a plot to blow up
the track a short distance north of here
where it passes near the tide-flats they
say the powder is stored there in readiness

   there was little more that she could tell
  him and while she prepared and served
 the evening meal the talk drifted to other
 subjects brown related several of his rail-
 road adventures in which she was keenly
 interested as he finished the tale of
 third-rail hawkins and frenchy she in-
 terrupted him to ask

   do all railroad men have nicknames
mr brown

  yes i guess most of em do

  may i ask what is yours

  he groaned inwardly here was one of
those pitfalls of society of which he had
heard if he told the truth he would cer-
tainly be committing a grave offense against
the rules of propriety and to lie was cow-
ardly he chose a middle course

  ah-limbs brown they call me but
say aint this a fine evening

  she smilingly admitted that it was as
she led the way to the front stoop brown
soon began to feel that her companionship
was very agreeable to him her voice
thrilled him strangely and it seemed that
there had grown between them a bond of
sympathy-an influence that was not less
real for its intangibility as if it were the
most natural thing in the world he told
her of his cherished hopes and ideals-
thoughts that he had jealously guarded
from the rough contact of his every-day
life

   do you know miss allen he said a
touch of sadness in his voice in the last
few years ive begun to think that a man
oughta figure on bein something more than
a boomer brakeman all his life red bill
mccrea used to say  what shall it profit
a man if he grabs the whole world and
cannot dissect the mustard i guess thats
about right too

   when one realizes his mistake he is
taking a long step in the right direction
she replied gently

   but its pretty hard when a man has to
live at these railroad boarding-houses a
saloons about the only place thatll give
him the glad smile

  after a pause he continued

 i-i was wonderin if youd be will-
ing to help a struggling young man like
me if he was trying to do the right thing 
why how could i help you mr
brown  

   itd help a lot if youd marry me he
returned modestly

  she laughed softly you honor me
greatly having known me only a few
hours but perhaps some one else has
asked before you

  has somebody beat me to it he de-
manded

  well there is tail feathers son of the
chief he has offered father a great many
horses and blankets for me

  when he would have spoken again she
warned him to silence pointing to the shad-
s

the railroad mans magazine

owy roadway gazing intently into the
darkness he discerned a skulking form
apparently carrying a heavy burden

   if you follow him you may find some-
thing that will interest you whispered the
girl

  harrigan thats me he rejoined
eagerly

  hastily bidding her good night he stole
away in the wake of the crouching figure
for perhaps a quarter of a mile north
along the tracks he followed silently care-
ful lest by the slightest sound he should
make his presence known

  at a point where the road turned sharp-
ly away from the shore line his quarry
plunged into the underbrush at the lower
side of the track with some misgivings
brown did likewise now began a period
of aimless creeping and crawling guided
only by the noises of the night some of
which he thought were made by the man
whom he pursued

  once he heard a peculiar sound near
him and prepared for action but entering
an open space he saw a small cascade of
dirt arising from a newly-made hole and
ltnew that it was only a badger seeking a
ground-squirrel for his repast

   at length in an unusually dense thicket
he scraped against something metallic an
investigation proved that he had stumbled
on three large canisters of powder rising
to his feet he stood motionless for several
minutes his ears strained to catch any
sound that might indicate the presence of
an enemy

  hearing nothing he stooped and pried
open the cans laying a train of powder
from each one then applying a match
he scrambled off at top speed

  he had gone scarcely thirty feet when
there came a blinding flash followed by a
dull report in the instant of light he was
startled at seeing a man directly in front
of him without slackening his pace
brown shot out his fist and the man fell
surrendering the right-of-way without ar-
gument but other figures sprang up and
in a few moments he was the center of a
silently struggling mass of men 

  brown went down fighting be it said
however that before he was bound there
was hardly one of his assailants who could
not show marks of the conflict

  uttering no word they marched him
down the slope he wondered vaguely if
they intended to throw him into the bay

to drown it soon became obvious that he
was not to die so easily doming to an old
quay at the waters edge one of the in-
dians forced his jaws open and thrust the
barb of a small fish-hook into his tongue

  to the hook was fastened a fine wire
which they forced between his teeth to pre-
vent its being held by them he was then
placed in a sitting posture on the edge of
the platform and the wire was made fast
to a floating log that was moored to the
pier this done his captors- one by one
glided away and disappeared in the shad-
ows

  only then did he begin to understand
their reason for placing him there the
tide was now at its highest when it began
to ebb the log to which he was fastened
would sink lower and lower until he was
drawn over with infinite pain he twisted
and turned until he lay face dojvn his head
hanging over the water

  lying so he composed himself to watch
the wire tauten for the last time he
knew now what was meant by the  death-
tide somewhere he had heard that
among these indians there was a super-
stition against shedding the blood of an
enemy in time of peace in this way they
left the fate of a prisoner in the hands of
their deity if he chose to stop the out-
flow of the tide the victim was released

  brown sighed heavily he could stand
to drop out he thought but he had failed
in his duty outwitted by a handful of in-
dians it was this that caused two bitter
tears to mingle with the drip-drip of blood
in the phosphorescent water about him

  gradually the slack went out of the wire
every slight movement of the log sent a
thrill of agony through him he writhed
about in an effort to secure a moments sur-
cease from the torture but the inexorable
pull continued down-down-down until
it seemed that he would go mad

  then faintly he heard a piteous cry
the strain ceased and he was being
dragged back to safety some one was
wiping his face with a damp cloth

  louise he whispered

  merciful heaven she sobbed they
nearly killed you you were just going
over when i came

  tenderly she withdrew the hook from
his swollen tongue

   do you feel better now   she asked

   sure im all right was the reply
howd you happen to find me
the death tide



  old bill jimson was wandering in die
woods and saw them bring you here the
poor fellow would have tried to help you
himself but the younger indians have so
terrorized him that he didnt dare father
is the only man in the village in whom he
has confidence so he came to our house
when he found that father wasnt at home
he broke down and cried-said you were
kind to him this afternoon and now if you
were killed it would be his fault you
didnt tell me you had met old bill
well well that must have been uncle
noahy yes i met him met a young
siwash at the same time-fellert looked
like somebodyd hit him in the chin with a
crab-apple but shucks he added de-
jectedly  after all i had to go and make
a fizzle of everything

  how can you say that didnt you
prevent them from blowing up the track
yes and let em catch me but
louise he went on wistfully  wont you
say that i got a chance against this tail
feathers person

  she averted her face a moment

   i brought your gun she said softly

 it might not be safe for you to return to
the village

  he got to his feet and took the rifle
but still feeling weak he seated himself
on a rock the girl stood facing him

  you didnt answer my question he
insisted doggedly

  is it a fair question mr brown re-
member i am part indian would you
be content to become a squaw-man and
maybe i am already promised to tail
feathers

  as she stopped speaking he saw that she
was staring fixedly at something behind
him suddenly she seized the rifle from
his hand and throwing it over his shoul-
der fired into the bushes a man leaped
in the air and came down in a heap his
hand still clutching a hunting - knife
brown recognized the young indian whom
he had first met on the hillside

   saved again i want my answer

  the girl pointed to the body at his feet

  that she said tremblingly is tail
feathers

  she swayed and would have fallen but
-brown was there

to save the flanges

a lubricating device which lessens the wear and tear on a locomo-
tives drivers

anew flange lubricator recently put on the
market by the collins metallic packing
company philadelphia can be adjusted to meet
any condition of design or construction of loco-
motives in service at the present time the
lubricating substance is in the form of a solid
block which is very easily and quickly applied
making the maintenance cost of the appliance
almost negligible

  it is claimed that when the lubricator is once
set and properly adjusted it requires no attention
during an ordinary trip of two hundred to three
hundred miles the only attention that it then
needs is the pulling back of the latch which is in
communication with the adjusting mechanism
which provides for the pressure of the lubricating
block against the wheel

  this operation is completed in an instant the
life of one lubricating block used on an engine in
switching service is from three thousand five hun-
dred to four thousand miles and from two thou-
sand five hundred to three thousand miles on a

passenger-engine when running at a high rate
of speed

  in a test made for the purpose of arriving at the
economic value of the device it is claimed that be-
fore the lubricator was applied to the locomotive
it was necessary to take the engine out of service
on account of sharp flanges at the end of four
months after it had made twelve thousand to four-
teen thousand miles after the lubricator was
applied it is claimed that there was very little
flange wear noted

  at the end of nine months when the engine had
a credit of twenty-four thousand miles it was ta-
ken out of service because the tires were hollow
worn to the extent of five-sixteenths of an inch-
the flanges showed very little wear the tires
were turned down to remove the high places and
the flanges were not touched the engine was then
placed in service with the hope of getting six
months more wear out of it before it would be
necessary to turn the tires-railway and engi-

europes old-fashioned
railroads

by charles frederick carter

frequently we hear reports of the antiquated rolling-stock and obso-
lete methods of european railroads but unless we have been abroad and
observed personally the sad state of things prevailing there we are unable
to appreciate what the traveling public of the old world must undergo in order
to be carted from one point to another

     mr carter as our readers know is an old railroad man who is one of our
most observing chroniclers of up-to-date railroad topics he has just returned
from an extended european journey during which he studied foreign railroad
conditions closely for the railroad mans magazine

     with the customary disapproval of the practical american railroader for
crude and undeveloped mechanical devices that should now be at the bottom
of the scrap pile he tells of the time-worn makeshifts that are still in vogue on
some of the foreign roads what mr carter saw and suffered abroad can
leave no doubt in the minds of our readers that american railroads have no
equal in the world

why the prospect of a railroad journey makes the european traveler
think twice before trusting himself to the
 tender mercies of a train

  an american even moderately
familiar with the railroads of
his own land those of europe
afford a contrast that is more
than startling it is almost in-
credible no amount of read-
ing in technical journals and books no
recollections however vivid of the foreign
transportation exhibits at the chicago and
st louis worlds fairs can prepare him for
the reality but when he has taken his
seat for his first railroad journey on the
other side of the atlantic it begins to dawn
upon him that he is in the mummified pres-
ence of the most remarkable case of arrested
development in the worlds history

  the railroad stopped short in the first
period of its growth in europe and it has

never taken a fresh start instead it has
been fossilizing ever since its railroads are
one of the chief reasons why europe lags
behind in the march of progress for ade-
quate transportation facilities are the first
and greatest requisites for prosperity with-
out which everything else counts for naught

  perhaps it may be contended that euro-
pean railroads serve the purpose for which
they were built so they do-after a fash-
ion so also can a man with two wooden
legs contrive to walk but no one will ven-
ture to maintain that he can walk as well
as with the kind of legs usually provided
by nature

  it may be something more than a coinci-
dence that government ownership and in-
ferior railroads are found together but for

i


the railroad mans magazine

present purposes it is necessary to go no
deeper into the subject than any tourist with
a reasonably good pair of eyes can see

the trials of the traveler

  when a man goes away from home in the
lnited states he can look forward to a
pleasant day or night or both resting at
ease in a comfortable chair or sleeping
peacefully ina good bed with appetizing
well-served meals to be had at regular
hours but in europe the very thoughts of
a railroad journey sends cold shivers down
his spine travel there is a nightmare
nothing less

  in the first place the traveler must get
down to the station at least half an hour
before the train-time to register his luggage
there are no last-minute rushes to the
station there for things are not organized
diat way every pound of luggage except
hand-bags taken into the coach must be
paid for at stiff rates

  two hundred pounds of baggage will
amount to as much as a fare for one per-
son in addition to this four men must
be tipped to get your trunk on the train
and four more to get it off again and up
to your hotel for the railroad does noth-
ing but haul the trunk after it has been
placed aboard these eight tips per stop
are on a fixed tariff usually amounting to
eighty cents if the hotel clerk knows his
business some of them are included in the
hotel bill and paid then they are collected
a second time by the tippee making the
total one dollar per town

  adding the cartage between the station
and the hotel brings the total up to 
lucky indeed is the traveler who is too
poor to have a trunk when all the tips
have been handed out and the railroads
charges paid the traveler gets a slip of
white paper about three inches square
which takes the place of the check used in
the united states on presentation of this
slip and the payment of four more tips the
traveler gets his trunk to his hotel at his
destination

the  comforts  of a carriage

  the luggage attended to the next step is
to capture a seat-if you can and then
hang on to it-if you can this is an
operation requiring no small degree ofskill
the stepson the cars are designed to make

the compartments as nearly inaccessible as
possible and besides there are always a
lot of natives wanting the seat you are after
and they are more expert at scaling die
steps

  there are three classes on all continental
roads and smoking and non-smoking com-
partments for each class thus there are
five chances to one that you will find your-
self in the wrong pew when you do get
aboard to add zest to the game there are
no separate cars for each class but all the
various classes are mixed up in each and
every car

  when he is finally settled completely
winded the american tenderfoot finds to
his measureless disgust that the european
passenger - car or  carriage as they will
persist in calling it has never developed
beyond the stage-coach idea in england
andbelgium particularly there are many
cars built to represent three stage-coach
bodies placed end to end just like the ear-
liest cars used on die baltimore and ohio
away back in the thirties

boxes on wheels

  they have four wheels like a stage-
coach though some of the larger ones have
six wheels both the four-wheeled and the
six-wheeled models were tried found worth-
less and discarded in the earliest years of
railroad development in america one
short journey in them is enough to reveal
the reason why such cars had so brief a
career here of all the bone-racking in-
stigators of uncharitable thoughts that ever
ran on rails they are the worst

  passengers unfortunate enough to be in-
carcerated in them dare not open their
mouths to voice their dissatisfaction with
their plight for fear of having their teeth
shaken out the only easy riding cars
found in a journey extending through six
nations were on german express trains
they had four-wheeled trucks somewhat af-
ter the american fashion a few of the
best trains in england also have cars with
four-wheeled trucks

  whatever the size of the car or the ar-
rangement of the running gear the resem-
blance of the interior to the stage-coach of
a century ago is more marked than that of
the exterior there is the same low roof
and the same narrow straight-backed seats
placed face to face that are to be found in
the old stage-coach or the more modern

brougham indeed the european mind
seems incapable of understanding that seats
in a public conveyance can be arranged in
any other way

  even on the broad decks of steamboats
all the seats are arranged in pairs to compel
the passengers to sit face to face space
in railway carriages is dealt out so spar-
ingly that there is no place to put ones
feet except in the lap of the passenger op-
posite when he tries to reciprocate this
arrangement is found to be not altogether
satisfactory

  those straight-back narrow seats too
are comfort destroyers to recline in a
comfortable position is impossible the
luckless passenger must sit bolt upright and
if he wears a hat the brim strikes the back
of the seat or the compartment wall forcing
his chin upon his breast

  in two minutes he has the fidgets in
two minutes more he is in a violent temper
and a little later he has abandoned all hope
of doing his situation justice in mere words
and has sunk into a state of coma from
which he does not emerge until his destina-
tion is reached there is no escape by going
into a better-class car

  first-class compartments are in the same
car with the second-class and there is ab-
solutely no difference between them except
in the color of the upholster as the colors
are not standardized the passenger who
pays first-class fare which is pretty stiff
is always haunted by a dread that he may
be riding in a second-class compartment at
first-class rates

every convenience is lacking

  no matter what the class or the country
the windows are invariably let down by a
strap precisely like those in a stage-coach
or a hack-that is unless you are so un-
fortunate as to share the compartment with
native travelers in that case the windows
are not let down if there is anything in
europe that seems to be more dreaded than
water it is fresh air

   six or eight natives will get into one of
the tiny compartments carefully close the
windows or the window and the door open-
ing into the  corridor and breathe into
each others faces for hours at a stretch
even during the hottest days of august
and mind you the windows are the sole
means of ventilation after having been
made sick once by an experience of this

   	rr

sort a prudent american will never enter
a compartment unless he can get an end
seat where there is a fighting chance to
keep the window open

  on ordinary trains there is no communi-
cation between compartments once shut
in at a station a passenger cannot escape
until the guard comes to his rescue at the
next stop on express trains there may be
 corridor  cars these have the inevitable
compartments but there is a narrow aisle
at one side

  this does not necessarily mean that a pas-
senger may go from car to car throughout
the train only on the best through trains
are vestibuled cars to be found owing to
the distance between cars due to the pre-
posterous buffers in universal use the vesti-
bules are long narrow unclean passages in
vivid contrast to the familiar vestibule at
home only corridor cars have lava-
tories

starvation or nausea

  such conveniences are regarded as the
last word in advanced travel and are proud-
ly featured by the enterprising railroads
owning them on french roads water-
tanks are carried on the roof over the lava-
tories and these leak so badly that on half
the cars observed the rooms were flooded
and could not be entered at all

  the dining-cars are immeasurably in-
ferior to those in america to tell die brutal
truth they are frowsy and in need of a
general overhauling at the shops window-
shades are sometimes missing so the sun
can shine straight into the eyes of the
diners and the linoleum on the floor is
often dilapidated and soiled instead of
flowers for table decorations advertising
cards are stuck up in every available space
the meals are the everlasting table dhote
luncheons and dinners from which there
seems to be no escape in europe widi the
same monotonous round of unappetizing
dishes doled out with stiagy hand and the
invariable slow service

  there are  restaurant cars  on the boat-
trains from london to dover but as there
is no communication with the rest of the
train and no stops the diner must enter
the car at one terminal and ride to the other
for this an entrance fee or seat fare
of sixtytwo cents is charged for the ride
of seventy-five miles this added to the
regular first-class fare makes a rate of a


the railroad mans magazine

trifle over seven cents a mile which it must
be admitted is ample once on board it
is found that tea costs twenty-five cents a
cup and other things in high-cost-of-living
proportion

   the only alternative for hungry passen-
gers is the station lunch-cart or counter
except in france the sole eatable to be had
at these places is ham sandwiches gener-
ali- the hard dry rolls are not buttered
and not infrequently the ham is obstreper-
ously passee pie is unknown in europe
and cake is not obtainable at railroad sta-
tions there are neither cold beans chick-
en doughnuts nor any of the familiar
staples of the railroad lunch-counter at home
-nothing but ham sandwiches

   in france however one can buy a paste-
board box for ninety cents containing a
lunch for one person here is an inventory
of the contents which never vary

     one roll dry and hard as charity without
   butter	

     one very small slice of ham

     one very small slice of beef

     one very small piece of chicken

     one very small slice of cheese

     one bottle containing three-fourths of a
   pint of vile wine

     oh yes salt there is a really gener-
   ous portion of salt

no water to drink

   it is foolish to get angry about it for
there is no water to quench indignation how-
ever righteous a passenger could parch
with thirst until his sufferings culminated
in spontaneous combustion for all the relief
he could find on the train there isnt any
water to be had even at the stations

   it isnt possible to buy a bottle of min-
eral water except at the more important
stations and if there happens to be a heavy
run of americans the scanty supply is like-
ly to be sold out before late-comers get
around on german express-trains a small
carafe of dirty stale warm water open to
the dust and the bacteria may be found in
fhe lavatories

   no one even in the direst extremity of
thirst would drink the stuff the only
recourse of the thirsty passenger is to buy
some vile sour wine at forty cents for
three-fourths of a pint in germany the
beer that cannot be sold elsewhere is ped-
dled at railroad stations in europe it is
considered disgraceful to drink water under
any circumstances only the most brazen

tenderfoot from the  states  ever drinks
water in public

  an american observer is filled with
amazement to find that trains can be op-
erated with the obsolete equipment in use in
europe in england vacuum brakes are
still largely used on passenger-trains im-
agine a-vacuum brake still surviving in
 generally however the air-brake is
used on passenger-trains though it is likely
to be of an antiquated type

steam brakes on a  - per cent grade

  whatever the type the air-brake is not
the safety device it is in america euro-
peans seem to think it is time to find out
whether the brakes are in order when they
are needed i saw many engines changed
and cars set out and picked up but just
once did i see the brakes tested according
to the invariable custom at home

  if a careless trainman were to neglect to
open the angle-cock on the train-pipe at
the tender thus cutting out the brakes on
the whole train the joke would certainly be
on the luckless passengers if anything hap-
pened one curious antediluvian relic in
switzerland had steam-brakes to hold its
passenger-trains while going down a four-
and-a-half per cent grade

  anything is good though when com-
pared with freight-trains - excuse me

 goods-trains a  goods-train  has to
be stopped before the brakes can be ap-
plied this is not an attempt to be funny
but a literal statement of an exact fact

  in england and northern europe many
 goods-wagons or  goods-vans are in- 
nocent of any brake whatsoever the others
have brakes operated by a long lever placed
horizontally at one side of the car in such
a position that it can be operated only by
a man standing on the ground these
brakes are not intended to control speed
but only to hold the wagon on the
sidings

  when the engineer-that is the driver-
of a goods-train wants to stop he sim-
ply shuts off and lets the train drift until
it gets tired and stops of its own accord

  some of the engines have steam-brakes on
the drivers and all have a hand-brake on the
tender

  results of this method of handling trains
arc not always pleasant for instance on
august   an engineer on a paris
lyons and mediterranean goods-train
europes old-fashioned railroads



approaching telagh france saw a sema-
phore set against him and also saw a pas-
senger-train standing on the main line
ahead of him the only thing he could
do was to shut off jump and let his engiue
plow through the coaches crowded to the
limit with excursionists there were no
brakes and no means of controlling his train
twenty-four persons were killed and forty
were injured

  right here is a good place to smite the
popular delusion about the safety of rail-
road travel in europe we are perpetually
having the vast superiority of european
roads dinned into our ears when as a mat-
ter of fact they are not safe at all here
are a few samples from a sickeningly long
list of horrors that is open to any one who
vill take the trouble to look it up

    contich belgium may   col-
  lision  killed  injured

    saujon france august   col-
  lision  killed  injured

    rottenmann austria september  
  collision  killed  injured

  safety how can there be such a thing
in countries where brakes are almost un-
known where cars are built of the flimsiest
possible materials thrown together in the
cheapest possible way and where a large
percentage of the signals are operated by
women 

  in the mountainous regions of switzerland
and northern italy some of the goods-
wagons  have hen-coops at one end which
in the case of box-cars are placed partly
above and partly below the roof in this
hen-coop is a brake-staff with a short cross-
piece with one end turned up like the letter
l for a handle instead of a wheel

hen-coops for brakemen

  the lower end of the brake-staff ter-
minates in a screw on which a block travels
up and down as the staff is turned the
brake-chain is attached to the block thus
the brakes are set as the block works up
the staff and released when it is screwed
down the pitch of the thread is below
the angle of repose so the brake will stay
put anywhere without the use of a dog f
the hen-coop is just large enough for a
shack or rather a guard to squeeze in
provided he isnt a very big man there is
no room for him to swing himself on the
brake-but there is no occasion to swing
himself he can set the brake with one

hand to the limit of the braking power of
the tiny four-wheeled car

  in case of emergency the  guard  doesnt
hustle around setting the brakes on half
a dozen cars as an american brakeman
would do under similar circumstances he
cant for those long-range buffers hold the
cars so far apart that it would be as much
as a mans life was worth to try to leap from
one to another no the guard just
stands in his hen-coop and lets events take
their course

  there are three men to a train conse-
quently there are three brakes to hold it
braking-power being dependent on the
weight of the cars thpse three little match-
boxes together hold the train back with about
as much power as if a stubborn calf were
tied to the rear buffer of the last car

seven tons on one car

  it is not enough to describe a european
 goods-wagon  as small or light for such
words fail to tell how little it is as a
matter of fact to american eyes they re-
semble pill-boxes on casters some of them
look as if they would not hold a dose of
salts to get down to figures the average
capacity of  goods-wagons  on the lon-
don and northwestern which may be taken
as a fair sample of the rest is seven tons
coal-cars run a little larger many having
the stupendous capacity of ten tons while
there are very few cars with a capacity of
twenty tons all  goods-wagons  have
four wheels two feet nine inches in diam-
eter the wheel-base is not less than eight
nor more than nine feet

  the buffers hold the cars from three to
three-and-a-half feet apart the only
coupling used anywhere is a chain of three
links and a hook like the original couplings
used on the first train on the mohawk and
hudson railroad back in august 

  it is interesting to note that the mohawk
and hudson couplings were improved before
the first run of fifteen miles was completed
while the chain couplings are still in use in
europe on passenger-cars the middle
link is replaced by a screw-bolt with right
and left hand threads and a lever to work
it by means of which the slack is taken up

  yard work is reduced to its simplest ele-
ments the cars having no brakes there is
no occasion to ride them when kicking a
cut down a siding the couplings are so
awkwardly placed that it is necessary to


the railroad mans magazine

come to a stop to cut off a car or make a
coupling the switchman carries a hoe-
liandle with a hook on the end with which
to manipulate the coupling-chains and a
bugle with which to signal the engineer

   a bugle is always used to start trains on
the continent in england the guard blows
a whistle until he attracts the engineers
attention or runs out of breath in the for-
mer case he waves a green flag until the
engineer takes the hint to leave town in
the latter he rests awhile and then tries
again neither the bell-cord nor the air-
whistle is known in europe

  the bugle is relied on almost exclusively
in switching only on a few occasions have
i seen hand-signals given when these are
resorted to any sort of wiggle means any-
thing the wiggler thinks it does thus i
saw two swiss railroad men signaling an
engineer for the same train movement

  one gave the american standard code
back-up signal the other gave the go-ahead
signal the engineer took it all in then
went ahead probably he guessed right for
neither of the trainmen had a spasm

  speaking of signals the european codes
are marvels of simplicity here is the
whistle code as nearly as it could be com-
piled solely from observation

  approaching stations one short squeak
apply brakes one short squeak release
brakes one short squeak back up one
short squeak starting a train one short
squeak

   i heard a great deal of whistling but no
matter what the message was it was always
conveyed in one short squeak

   squeak  is used advisedly for the
noi-e made by european locomotive whistles
is just that and nothing else not once did
i hear the deep-throated bellow of the
american locomotive whistle all the whis-
tles over there appear to have been picked
before they were half-grown the note of
all of them is the shrillest attainable for-
tunately the whistles are so small and the

sound they make so weak that even the
engineer cannot hear it unless the wind
happens to be favorable

  in designing locomotives as in designing
passenger-cars the great end to be attained
seems to be to produce the most uncouth
awkward and inconvenient thing possible
no locomotives have the comfortable roomy
cabs to be found on american locomotives
though the swiss engines of the latest models
approximate them somewhat in external
appearance

  in france and belgium few engines had
even the pretext of a cab the best that
any of them possess is a wind-shield with
a rudimentary roof amounting to little more
than a short deflector sprouting from the
top the best of them afford little protec-
tion from snow and wind the rest none at
all there are never any seats even the
newest locomotives exhibited at the brus-
sels exposition had no place for the engine-
crew to sit down

  in many cases the engineer stands on the
left side instead of the right wherever
he stands all the levers for handling the
machine are arranged to make his work as
awkward as possible instead of a revers-
ing lever they all have a screw and a
hand-wheel at which the engineer must
grind for some time to hoss er as the
english say

  the throttle is fearfully and wonderfully
made frequently it is a long steel bar
fastened by the middle to the throttle-stem
which rotates instead of having a longi-
tudinal movement to work it the engi-
neer must face the thing and devote his
undivided attention to pumping it up and
down

  the prize-winner was a locomotive in
service on the northern of france the
throttle was placed in front of the wind-
shield on the side of the boiler the engi-
neer had to lean up against the side of the
boiler-head and reach outdoors to get hold
of the throttle-lever

                 what a girl like mexie can do
                 with the heart of a strong man

synopsis of previous chapters

mason the grizzly and his partner  hungry joe prospectors in the western wilds enter-
tain at their camp-fire a stranger who tells them of wonderful gold mines fifty miles up the
mountains to reach which however seems almost impossible owing to hostile indians mason de-
cides to make the journey alone after riding all night he conies suddenly on an indian encamp-
ment and is compelled to alter his course he encounters three indians kills them disguises him-
self in their blankets and feathers but is finally captured by a band of utes who proceed to put him
to death in boiling water mason manages to escape during the excitement caused by his hurling the
son of the chief into the boiling water but is eventually captured by another band and brought back
to be burned alive

  he my prisoner you lose him i git
him he go on back trail head off sol-
diers utes have peace or red shirt fight
colorow 

  the indians divided themselves and
gathered behind their respective chiefs for
a long still minute colorow and red shirt
fronted each other red shirts band was
the larger the soldiers were coming colo-
row turned on his heel and stalked away

  mason was free once more he raised
his eyes to the merry stars then he shook
hands with red shirt

   white brother go quick come
handing mason an old buffalo robe and
moccasins he led the way down the lonely
canon red shirt feared to trust even his
own followers he would take his white
prisoner to the mouth of the canon himself
and see him safely by the slinking outposts
then too the white man would know more
surely who had been his friend who had
saved his life and when the white soldiers
came he would befriend red shirt

  though the wily old indian gave ma-
son his life and liberty there his generosity
ended red shirt rode his split-ear war
pinto the swiftest long-distance runner of
all the ute horses he was armed with a
sharpes rifle mason trudged along on
foot only the blanket and moccasins had
been given to him

             seven ponies came with a
             blazing stick through the
             tangled wood mason watched
             her light the pile

old girl and lets get the jpb over with in
a hurry i dont blame you a bit twas
a shame to kill that kid i know but i had
to do it bet its die first bath he ever had
now its not nice for you to look at me like
that-who-o-o that smoke gets in my eyes

   and-whew i always did hate the
smell of burning hair-as i was going to
say-i object particularly to you looking at
me for in a minute-u-g-g-g- courage
mason courage itll soon be over-hal-
lo red shirt whats up 

  red shirt leaped onto the crackling
brush and kindling fagots swung his
tomahawk and cut the raw-hide rope that
bound mason to the stake white man and
red man leaped from the fire together
twenty of red shirts sub-chiefs surround-
ed mason faced outwards and raised their
rifles excitement prevailed red shirt
walked straight up to colorow and thun-
dered in english that mason might hear


the railroad mans magazine

  at die end of the canon red shirt
halted in his indian ferocity he already
regretted having freed the captive but it
would be a fatal mistake for red shirt to
relent and take his prisoner back to camp

  red shirt never doubles on his trail
he said to mason as the white man and the
red looked at each other in silence

    red shirt the grizzly will not forget
he thanks you adios

   red shirt all one heap fool he kill
three white man-you fur hissed the
indian as he jerked his rifle to his shoulder
and fired

  mason ducked he half expected it
hi fingers closed over a three-pound stone
an instant later it wedged fast in red
shirts skull hanging to his pintos reins
the indian rolled from his saddle mason
gripped the snorting plunging horse by the
raw-hide bit remembering the service of
his late disguise mason tore the war-bon-
net from the smashed head-it felt wet in
die darkness-grabbed the rifle and am-
munition and swung into the saddle barely
in time

  the three indian scouts lurking near
made for him through the gloom but too
late the frantic bronco further inflamed
by the smell of a white man on his back
squatted half-humped an instant then flat-
tened into a whirlwind run three arrows
whistled hungrily into the empty night

  mason was free

  two indians were carrying a third one
dead up the dark silent canon to the in-
dian camp a third ran ahead with the
news this left the canon unguarded

  two miles away mason made a wide
detour to avoid a long dark mass of ad-
vancing horsemen although they were
moving with rapid caution yet they made
no noise their horses hoofs may have
been wrapped with strips of blanket ma-
son kept too far back in the night to see
that they were riding four abreast

chapter vii
still a prisoner

tvwlight found mason across ber-
thond pass and near the hot vapor
cavern now known as idaho springs in
 this- was chicago bar urging the
tired pinto along through the gray mist he
was thrilled with pleasure to hear in iron
anglo saxon

  halt-or ill fire

  halt he did right in his tracks from
the brush before him stepped three white
men with poised rifles

   get off that horse and hold up your
hands

  with pleasure gentlemen laughed
mason as he obeyed two kept him covered
with their rifles while the third came for-
ward secured his own weapon and took
charge of the pinto

   come with us run and we shoot
say nothing

  not a little puzzled mason did so
they walked a quarter of a mile down
clear creek canon one of the strangers in
the lead two behind one of these carrying
masons rifle as well as his own while the
other brought up the rear with the pinto

  in the growing light of the morning the
three looked hard at their prisoner but be-
yond exchanging glances now and then
said nothing

  in truth mason was a fantastic object
his hair was scorched smoke and soot dis-
figured his face and skin the indian war-
bonnet he had removed during the night and
tied to the saddle where it hung begrimed
with dust and red shirts blood

  on his feet were fancy beaded moccasins
too large for him the old buffalo robe
with the hair worn off in great bare patches
was hung and belted about him like a cave-
mans mantle he had no head covering
beyond his long hair now tangled and full
of dead leaves sand and mud

  on his face there was as much dried
blood as dirt and soot his left arm was
bleeding from its arrow-wound and hung
painfully badly swollen verily mason
was not apollo

  behind a clump of quaker asp the three
led their prisoner here were their horses
at a sign from one of his captors mason
once more bestrode the pinto while the other
two tied his feet together beneath the horses
body and tied his hands behind his back

   but see here- began mason

  shut up ordered his guard and to
give weight to his order he gave mason a
punch in the pit of his long empty stomach
with the barrel of his rifle that knocked the
breath out of him

  lay low is the beginning of wisdom
muttered mason to himself anyway this
is not half bad compared to the frying on
deck last night-but i wish i had some
breakfast
mason the grizzly



  with no more ado the four strung out
into a trot down the canon

  where you taking me asked mason
in defiance of another poke from the rifle

   st charles-maybe hell was the la-
conic reply

  revolving this in his head and not hav-
ing the slightest idea of what was up mason
jolted along in hungry begrimed and
wounded silence down the canon they
went at a six-mile-an-hour trot the sun
was just lighting the floor of the canon when
they reached the forks of the creek

  so far their route had been lonely but
from here on they passed hundreds of eager-
eyed gold-seekers coming up the canon to
the forks all bound for bob-tail hill
each was intent on his own ends and be-
yond an interested or indifferent glance no
one paid any attention to the three men and
mason

  it was noticed that the man riding in the
load carried two rifles and over his left
shoulder-one pouch before him the other
behind the ends tied to his belt-hung a
pair of saddle-bags

  the rifle and the saddle - bags he had
taken from mason what the saddle-bags
contained mason had no idea they were
tied to the saddle when he vaulted into it
the night before and he did not stop to
examine them

  as mason was led at a rapid jog past the
forks of the creek and away from the
trail up the north fork to the new dig-
gings he drew a deep breath frowned and
set his teeth as if disappointed his guards
noticed this and wondered at the depth of
the sigh

  at noon the four rode into st charles
thirty-five miles away stiff and sore ma-
son was taken from the now exhausted pin-
to led into the offices of the ben holliday
stage-coach lines and handcuffed

  two of his captors kept armed guard
over him while the third leaving his own
rifle in the corner took masons gun and
the saddle-bags into another room on the
door of which was marked
--

private office
vamose

  various men came rapped on that door
and were admitted a crowd gathered out-

side in an hour-a very long hour-die
door opened and out filed fifteen or twenty
men

  their leader evidently holliday himself
-a bluff hearty jovial man but one whose
core was of iron-said to mason

  weve voted not to hang you just yet
well wait till the troops and the boys get
back and we have the rest of em any-
thing to say for yourself

  yes give me something to eat let me
curry this dirt off me give me some clothes
fix up this arm of mine and let me smoke
if you have no objections i would like to
know whats up im not on to your
game said mason

  the bluff man looked keenly into ma-
sons sleepy bloodshot yet frank and fear-
less eyes

  pardner youre either the whole ute
sioux cheyenne and arapahoe nation
rolled into one and jammed into a white
hide or youre a square man we dont
know which yet-and youve got nothing to
say about liow we decide either

  but ill tell you this just on general
principles ten days ago our treasure-coach
was wiped out by red shirts band down
the platte between here and fort morgan
nothing new in that but we had twenty
thousand in the chest he got it the red
devils were led by renegade white men and
i suppose they got the money now the
v cs-that is the vigilance committee if
youre a tenderfoot-pick you up dressed
like an arapahoe medicine-man gong crazy
and in your saddle-bags we find the whole
twenty thousand-

   i see murmured mason in die last
twenty-four hours he had grown hard to
surprise then he added

   those are red shirts brains on that
war bonnet i mixed em up with a rock
last night

   very likely so much like red shirt 
put in his original captor sarcastically

  well gentlemen youv got the drop
dont hang me for a week if youll do me
a favor but whether you do or not trot
out a bath some clothes some grub and
a smoke

  the v cs went back into the private
office in five minutes his captor came out
and still keeping mason under the three
rifles which had guarded him from chicago
bar to st charles he was taken away to a
stout log cabin in the bed of cherry creek
which by politeness and for the dignity of


the railroad mans magazine

the city was called the jail here
alone in the obscurity of one small window
in the plank door after a wash and a dress-
ing for his arm a change of clothes and a
feast of two pounds of buffalo hump and a
quart of coffee mason lay down to rest and
think and sleep

  outside in the sunlight the two guards
lounged before the door it was two oclock
in the afternoon when at dark the guard
brought in supper mason was asleep the
next morning when breakfast came he was
still sleeping noon still asleep the
guard gathered up the last nights supper
the breakfast and the dinner he had just
brought in and tossed them through the jail
door into the creek then he went out-
side padlocked the door and began a game
of  seven up  with his fellow warder at
four oclock the game was interrupted by a
husky voice from the little window in the
door

   say pardner have you got a match  

  a boxful was handed up and there was
a grunted

   thanks u-m-m-m

  then through the bars wafted a cloud of
blue content next came a cheery whistle
followed by

   got any more of that buffalo hump
left

  the player who had been winning all
afternoon passed in a chunk of cold meat
weighing a pound there was silence for
ten minutes then

   got any more  

  this time the good-natured card-player
handed in a piece of hump as large as his
head and added to it a pail of water

  nothing more was heard from the pris-
oner for the rest of the day when the
guards this time together took in supper
mason a piece of buffalo meat in one hand
his pipe in the other was stretched flat on
hi- back snoring like a well-developed dog-
fight

  the two men looked down at the sleeping
one then at each other and smiled with
many wrinkles

   hes no renegade said one softly

  not much muttered the other

  on noiseless toe they went out and
locked the door

  across the platte at that moment there
broke loose a great hubbub there were
shots yells whoops beating of pans and
boards-pandemonium on a boom down
to the river through the night it came

splashed across and entered st charles
mason rolled over uneasily and in a weak
voice muttered

    go it red shirt

  it was a long dark mass of advancing
horsemen riding four abreast but making
noise enough to give china an earache the
utes had been surprised in the canon the
backbone of the tribe had been broken half
were dead the rest had scattered like quail
by twos and threes twenty were prisoners
these prisoners belonged to red shirts
band

  with the cavalcade rode hungry joe
the stranger had left the party at the forks
of the creek and gone up the north fork
to the new diggings but joe come into st
charles

  no sleep that night for the embryotic
denver a small body of cavalry had been
the care of the avenging force but nine men
out of every ten were st charles frontiers-
men the tenth came out the jail was
raided

  mason ready to be hung his pipe in one
hand tobacco-pouch in the other the buf-
falo meat - what was left of it - in his
pockets was shot aloft to the platform shoul-
ders of hungry joe and rushed to the great
town square

  standing on hungry joes shoulders
astride that massive head mason told his
story for the first time he told of the
bringing by the stranger of the tidings about
the new diggings to the camp by hot sul-
phur the saddling of rattler the swift
determined night-ride to get to the new dig-
gings the discovery of the fire and the dan-
cing figures in the box canon ahead the
arrow from out the darkness the whirl and
rapid escape along the back trail and into
the little branch canon the climb to the
little park the wiggling up the ridge to pick
out the route the camp in the rain under
the dripping willows and of his going to
sleep

   then he spoke of the surprise by the ute
the arrow-wound through the arm and into
the ground where an instant before had lain
his body the shooting of horse and rider
and knifing them to the death because he
dare not shoot again the necessity of throw-
ing the carcasses of both horse and rider into
the stream the hurried climb to the edge of
the timber the discovery and killing from
behind the tree of the galloping indian the
taking and wearing of the disguise  the dash
over the ridge the shooting in midair of the
mason the grizzly



drunken and outlandishly dressed indian
waiting in ambush the chase down the little
canon and through the deserted indian
camp the shot backward from the revolver
that dropped the indian and his horse into
a rolling heap the rain of bullets arrows
war-clubs and stones from above the death
of rattler and the stunning of himself the
reviving in the icy torrent of the frasier
where he had been thrown his despair and
of his cool solution of colorow

  he related briefly how he had been
stripped and led to torture in the boiling
kettle how to gain an opportunity he had
insulted the son of colorow then thrown
him into the kettle how pursued he had
dashed down the canon and right into red
shirts band how he had been taken back
and tied to the stake how the fire had
singed him how red shirt for selfish in-
terests had freed him and fronted colorow
how red shirt had clothed him so meager-
ly had taken him to the mouth of the canon
alone and had devilishly tried to kill him
how he had brained red shirt with a stone
grabbed his pinto head-dress and gun es-
caped the three scouts and got away how
he had unknowingly avoided the dark si-
lent avenging column of justice - dealing
white men and how at length he had been
arrested

  the very rudeness of his speech graced
his cause with these pleasant gay and ra-
diant soldiers they swore that he was a
square man and when he called on his
living rostrum and the indian prisoners to
witness it the jovial holliday shouted

  why didnt you say so before

  yes why yelled the crowd

   would you have believed it   asked
mason

  no-o-o came doubtfully from some-
where

  the rest were uneasily silent

  just what happened the rest of that night
mason never clearly remembered this he
does know the town was full of men too
many for whom to find beds when day
was breaking he and hungry joe went back
to the jail the door was open and inside
on the bare floor lay his three recent cap-
tors asleep as the place smelled like a
moonshine distillery mason had no fear of
awakening them

  hungry joe selecting the fat leg of one
for a pillow settled down to sleep mason
took the place next the door to git the
air drowsily thought the huge gambler

from there perhaps mason could see the
morning star

chapter viii

cherry creek and the lady

vtason awoke with kicking temples
and a skin that was hot and dry and
tight hungry joe looked him over and
announced solemnly  mountain fever

  that was the beginning of a five months
siege that left mason weighing but ninety-
five pounds a parchment-covered skeleton
barely alive then slowly he grew better
and for two months did little but sit in the
sun and eat

  all thoughts of the new diggings had
gone long ago the country was staked for
miles and it would be months before he
could again pound a drill or stand in the
icy water of the gulches with a pan or
rocker

  that ride had been too much for mason
it was too much for any man but the men
who had cheered him that night in st
charles did not let him die a log cabin
has plenty of chink-holes hence it is a
good hospital buffalo soup and baked
apples at twenty-five cents apiece are ideal
for a typhoid digestion no other medicine
than quinin pure water and fresh air
worked wonders slowly he grew strong
again

  then did bluff ben holliday recall that
mason had saved his firm twenty thousand
dollars he offered mason one thousand
dollars as a reward which mason prompt-
ly refused then the stage-man offered
him a loan-any amount this mason also
refused

  again did holliday proffer help this
time a stock of books and stationery found
but little injured among the burned wreck-
age of a raided wagon-train its owner lay
scalped beside it with twenty-seven arrows
in his body his heirs and his name were
unknown

  after an hour with his pipe mason quiet-
ly accepted this offer the next day st
charles had its first book-store mason
was clerk janitor and proprietor busi-
ness was brisk soon in a small way he
began to lend money his standing as a
square man drew to him sundry little
buckskin-bags full of gold dust and nug-
gets for safe keeping

mason did what primitive banking st


the railroad mans magazine

charles required the large accounts such
as wells fargo  co and all eastern
business was of course handled by holli-
day mason loaned a little when he had
it to spare thus business prospered with
him in the new diggings forty miles
away many struck it rich but more came
back to st charles hungry and desperate

  the fever that mason had cursed he now
blessed for bging a late arrival he too
would probably have been among the hun-
gry ones as it was he had a good
though modest business steadily growing
better but it was not the profits that ma-
son valued most he had found a gold-
mine right on his own shelves-a bonanza
of words  of thoughts of feeling-his
books mason was his own best customer
what ruins a saloon-man makes a book-
dealer he began to keep a diary tnot of
events alone but also of his thoughts and
impressions this diary it has been my
privilege to see and make extracts from

  but there is a fate tiiat shapes our ends
rough-hew them as we may in the spring
of  it rained for ten days on the divide
twenty miles to the southeast of the head-
quarters of cherry creek yet that bed of
sand remained almost dry suddenly on
the tenth day a wall of water and liquid
quicksand six to eight feet high rolled down
cherry creek on the helpless settlement it
was the last blow of die wilderness under
it civilization all but strangled but the set-
tlement revived lived and to-day is the
queen city of the plains

  when darkness settled over gasping
denver cherry creek was once more a
gentle litde stream barely six feet wide
rippling along in innocence only its mud-
diness told that it was still malignant

  a man stood on the bank where that
morning there had been a book-store this
man was mason silently he watched the
passing water

  give me back my books he mut-
tered then he glanced up at the kindly
stars when his eyes again fell to the water
at his feet he laughed quietly and lit his
pipe

  between igniting puffs he mused aloud

   now-pu ff-for the-pu ff-pu ff-
mines of-puff-montezuma

  he seated himself on the sand-filled
wreck of his store as the smoke floated in
slow curls from his lips he fell to dreaming

  the wilderness had robbed mason of all
he had

  cherry creek was a slimy stretch of muck
and quicksand a mile wide here had
stood the heart of denver it was gone

  but not a day nor a sigh did denver
waste the wrecked part of the town was
to be rebuilt at once this time on high
ground back from cherry creek and the
platte safe from all floods

  mason did not forget his banking busi-
ness he hunted up those he owed-they
did not seek him out in his misfortune-
and transferred to them the debts owed to
him for money loaned this done he had
left one thousand dollars a good indian
pony and outfit a clear name and a clean
conscience

  ben holliday again offered help but this
mason declined with a shake of the head
and a silent grip of the hand as they were
about to part the overland coach rolled up
to the door an indian arrow stuck in the
leathern baggage boot behind from the
coach stepped a young woman evidently
from her dress and manner a widow

   can you tell me where i can find mr
holliday she asked

   im your man madam what can i do
for you its yours to ask

   i beg your pardon mr holliday but i
have come all the way from iowa to find
my husband he left for pikes peak in the
gold rush of fifty-nine five years ago and
disappeared i prayed that he was not
dead but at leavenworth i was told by
one of your drivers that a train similar to
the one he had joined there was captured
and burned on the arkansas by the sioux
in the late fall of 

   he said that you mr holliday could
tell me more so i came to you my hus-
band was named decatur-robert a de-
catur he was coming to denver to open
a book-store-

  holliday and mason exchanged such
vivid glances that the woman stopped and
shuddered then big-hearted holliday told
the shrinking woman how the wagon-train
had been found a charred wreck how her
husband lay sleeping beneath the grass roots
by the arkansas and how the books had
been found and saved

  then lie looked at mason and stopped
the woman brave as steel was standing
tearless waiting for the rest then mason
spoke

  mrs decatur he aid your hus-
bands books came into my possession
there was no one to claim them no one
mason the grizzly



knew of him i took them last week
they went down cherry creek they are
all gone their value was twelve hundred
dollars i have one thousand dollars that
is yours holliday lend me two hundred

  without a word but with a light in his
warm blue eyes that was good to see ben
holliday weighed out ten ounces of gold-
dust and handed it to mason from his
hip-pocket mason pulled his own buckskin
sack and handed both to the amazed wom-
an she protested holliday mildly in-
sisted and with gentle firmness forced her
to accept mason looked longingly into his
empty pipe

  the night-coach was about to leave mrs
decatur turned to holliday and asked for
a pen she rapidly wrote a page and hand-
ed it to him

   read it when i am gone she said

  she gave her hand to holliday and
thanked him warmly to mason she gave
both hands-and said nothing but mason
knew

  as the coach with three mules in the lead
and two on the wheel lumbered away into
the dusk the two men a little apart from
the rest swung their broad black hats in
answer to a good-by flutter of white that a
dainty hand held out of the window her
other hand held every cent mason had had
on earth

   if it hadnt been for cherry creek last
week that little woman would never have
gone back to the states mason said to
holliday

  why not

   cause i would have married her

   well-ill-be-hanged 

  perhaps she has proposed herself
laughed the bluff stage-coach owner lets
see what she says- and he opened the
papefr mrs decatur had given him

  well mason allow me to congratulate
you the dear little thing thinks she has
outwitted us after all here is a deed
drawn in true feminine fashion it is true
but still perfectly good for a mile or two
of cherry creek sand flats that some land-
faker or blasted pikes-peaker in the back
trail has sold her-more likely given her
she deeds it all to you mason you im
jealous its worth counting in the prairie
dogs and cactus aboutjorty cents in coun-
terfeit currency you own cherry creek
mason holliday roared

  ugh what a joke she god bless
her meant it as a million but ive got

all the cherry creek i want here give
it to me- reaching for the paper- i
want it as a keepsake im off for mexico
to-morrow morning

  not much my boy keepsakes are all
well enough this goes on record first
and then you can have it for a keepsake-
and the lady too-wasnt she a darling
cherry creek might be worth a thousand
dollars some day

   give me the lady and you can do as
you want with cherry creek got a
match  

chapter ix

mexico-the forgotten

atexico the egypt of america old

	when the anglo-saxon was born
when the wolf suckled romulus mexico
had a forgotten history of a forgotten race
and civilization did you ever read pres-
cott the blind historian of ancient ameri-
ca  do so then when you read of
grecian games played seven hundred years
before christ of the expedition after the
gold-filled sheepskins lining crude sluices
in asia minor of the sweating slaves who
built the pyramids of the glories of baby-
lon now buried beneath half a hundred
feet of dust of the hoary tales of the yellow
man-when you read of all these until
they seem to have been but yesterday and
long for something older turn to mexico

  here fought and conquered the bravest
the most determined man of history-cor-
tez here in royal green ruled monte-
zuma here was the magic land where
spain found new life and for a time be-
came the modern rome the ruler of the
world and the waves here is where lew
wallace wrote where general lee learned
the art and science of war where maxi-
milian died where diaz rules to-day

  do you believe that between the shores
of mexico-or the outlying antilles-and
the coast of africa thousands of feet be-
neath the blue waves of the atlantic rests
the cradle of man of civilization and of the
world-atlantis no then read

  whence came this now dead now for-
gotten civilization whispers echoed from
the depths of time legends told by dark
lips tell us that a white god so it seemed
to the copper - hued race once came with
the rising sun out of the distant waters
of the atlantic he taught the dark people


the railroad maxs magazine

tlie ways of civilization then he left
diem going east over the waves but prom-
ising to return with others of his kind

  when the steel-clad steel-souled span-
iard burned his ships and faced glory or
certain death this superstition won more
for him than did his sword or his awe-in-
spiring cannon

  montezuma himself each morning knelt
to the rising sun hoping that his eyes might
see the promise of the white god fulfilled
to-day the zuni indians and other tribes
who live in the pueblos at each sunrise
mount the mud walls of their hive-like
dwellings and watch for montezuma and
the white god to come with the morning
light

  are the legends of the north or the east
more beautiful than these legend the all
but silent historian of forgotten ages also
murmurs of a race of cultured warriors
sailing the unknown waters beyond the
pillars of hercules who safely plowed the
waves of european seas while yet the tim-
bers of the first phoenician galleys were
saplings

  did you ever compare egypt and mexi-
co do so it is an education in itself
if you would stud rome where would you
go to italy yes if you wished to
soak your mind in the indescribable influ-
ence which hovers over the pantheon like
a winged goddess would you sail for the
shores of greece then if you would
study the most ancient of countries you
must study mexico  it is not the most
ancient you say go to mitla in south-
eastern mexico on the ground read pres-
cott search the world for a man to read
unto you the writings on the stones at mit-
la you will not find him yet to many
the writings of oldest egypt are as clear as
motionless water here is something older
than the sanskrit tongue

  on a dripping mustang mason rode up
from the south to a new mexican sheep
ranch the years in mexico had changed
him greatly it was august in the early
seventies the time was noon out over
the glimmering desert the atmosphere
quivered like transparent jelly on the
horizon the fresh cool mirage came lured
vanished only to tempt again from a new
point

  squatted against the adobe in the full
glare of the sun wrapped in a serape si-
lence and mental mystery shaded by all his
wealth-his sombrero-was a dejected az-

tec he was not a mexican the hybrid
offspring of a hated father a despised
aztec slave but a pure-blooded indian

  his free fierce forefathers six hundred
years ago poured from the unknown in the
northwest down into what is now the val-
ley of mexico conquered and for three
centuries enslaved the milder toltecs here
these moors of mexico in their turn died
nobly beneadi spanish steel but the aztec
spirit was almost gone its embers smol-
dered in this morose shepherd glowing only
in his eyes

  he and mason ate in silence during
the stifling  afternoon they slept with
cool evening came the sheep and a de-
light-la senorita mexie tha girl was
the half-breed daughter of masons surly
host her white mother was long since
dead

  small slender and trim as a deer lithe
as a puma just bursting into throbbing
womanhood pulsating with life now
dreamy as the lotus now trembling at a
glance this little cleopatra had the mind
and manners of her evidently gentle mother
and the instincts of her half-savage father

  a venus in living bronze her nature
was too wild to be civilized too civilized
to be wild from high-arched moccasined
foot narrower than masons wrist to her
low broad forehead shaded with six great
curls as dark and fine as skeins of black
silk mexie was as dainty as a nymph
never bold always demure and ever fasci-
nating

  what might suddenly become animal
grossness in mexie at this time was white
fire the peons called her  the breath of
the morning to mason she was but a
child and he reverenced her goodness

  this girl-unsullied by civilization-had
not learned to lie nature never lies

  what is a lie she asked mason one
day

   to lie is to allow another mind to have
a false impression he answered

  she slowly repeated the definition to-
lie-is-to-allow-another-mind-to-have-a-false
impression 

  after a wordless hour she said i like
that a day later he heard her murmur
then one can lie by keeping silent

  mexie had but three virtues and the
greatest ofthese was charity

  books they read in his saddle-bags
was the tale of troy divine solomon in
all his wisdom spoke to them under the
mason the grizzly



chaparral lear raved the moor pleaded
macbeth cursed antony praised ham-
let pondered of these men mason read
aloud and they spoke of them as friends

  mason stopped for a meal lie stayed a
month and dreamed that he would return
again-perhaps once too often pounded
com pepper beans mutton coffee books
and the guitar the world forgotten the des-
ert and mexie all a lazy dream but
enough-for a month perhaps for life

  in the frosty morning they drove forth
the flock far from the corrals during
the blazing moon they rested in the shade
of the chaparral at evening they followed
the sheep home to the ranch there to
find the aztec still sitting still smoking
still silent

  seated one evening in the moonlight the
aztec the girl and the americano were the
sole inhabitants of three hundred square
miles of desert the guitar was silent  la
golondrina the lament of the moor leav-
ing his granada and la poloma were
the plaintive airs she played for him often
taking up the strains in a voice as sweet
and clear as tinkling water in the starry
stillness mason read from the tablets of his
memory a lizard twinkled across his hand
and the desert became the salted plains of
babvlon fertil with

  tired out mexie wrapped in masons
coat was stretched with the abandon of a
child on the ground at his feet-asleep
watching dreamily her face half shaded in
billows of hair he was drawn from the
asiatic to something older the aztec

  	seizor tell me of the lost mines of
montezuma he said

  silence a frown a scowl corn husk
cigarette rolled then in liquid accents

   gringo all fools senor there are 
lost mines of montezuma

  the smoky words died away the living
silence came again but the brown face
was kindling a soul was surging there
then in words sometimes lingering some-
times spit from the tongue came the aztecs
story

  listen i will tell you my mother
seiior was from one of the wives of monte-
zuma in my mothers veins was monte-
zumas blood and i am her son my father
and after him i once owned this ranch
and all the cattle i studied in the military
schools of chapultepec i was not always
this i was a soldier an officer before
monte and mescal made me what i am

sick at heart my lady of the snows my
wife mexies mother withered and died
i became a sheep dog almost a peon my
little girl-but now she is a woman is
free to do as she wishes i could not in-
fluence her if i tried you senor ameri-
cano are the first man she would ever obey
if you wish her she is yours when her
blood loves it worships it idolizes it be-
comes a slave it adores-but beware the
hate of the rebound

   but i know your language i once read
your books i know the history of mexico

  when the spaniards came our great
and good montezuma remembered what his
fathers had taught him that the white god
had gone over the waves into the morning
sun and some day would return on great
white wings to rule again over the lands
and lakes of mexico

   when runners came from the salt sea
to the great city on the lake with fresh fish
for montezuma-ah senor that is two hun-
dred miles and our people ran it in a day
and night so swift and sure of foot were
they-they told the great king that angels
in shining scales having white faces and
hair of gold riding huge beasts from whose
feet flew fire when they rode on the rocks
who killed with the thunder-fire and vol-
cano smoke had landed on our shores then
montezuma knew that the aztecs hour had
come

   he sent to them many kinds of gifts
one was a spanish helmet full of placer
gold another was a wheel of pure gold
thirty pahiis around in your money senor
it would be worth three hundred and twenty
thousand dollars but much more in those
days another wheel was of silver worth
twenty-five thousand dollars with these
gifts came many others fine cotton and
feather cloth and jewels with them mon-
tezuma sent this message white gods go
back into the sea 

   but cortez the ctesar of america and
of medieval times burned his ships and
marched into the heart of our capital senor
brave yes magnificent-but fatal to the
aztec

   then montezuma gave to cortez all
our treasures his father had hoarded gold
silver emeralds pearls fine cotton and
feather fabrics all his life these were
montezumas yet he gave them all to the
spaniard three great heaps of gold there
were the value in americano was six mil-
lions three hundred thousand dollars


the railroad mans magazine

   then seiior -mason saw the snake-
like eyes scintillating- came the melan-
choly night that night montezuma died
it was june   he sleeps in the
princely shades of chapultepec no one
knows where the deep-toned war-drum
of guatemozin the last of the aztecs he is
called seiior sounded over the city and we
fought in the dark till the morning light the
 battle of the causeway

  ah seiior the blood of four hundred
and thirty spaniards and four thousand az-
tecs stained the waters of the lake every
spaniard whose black soul crossed the great
white range that night was chased by ten
fantom aztecs there was laughter in the
heavens we won there alvarado the
child of the sun the spanish captain made
his leap there seiior were lost all the
spanish guns and cannons all their pow-
der and all their gold into the waters of
the lake it went it is there now santa
maria be praised that fight seiior was
the greatest defeat ever suffered by spain
on americano soil magnificent of a
little over six hundred spaniards we killed
two-thirds and made them drop their spoils

  ah seiior they were gods wound-
ed starving on wild cherries armed with
only mail sword and lance with only twen-
ty-one horses and no firearms flying to the
sea for life those two hundred weary
wounded spaniards aided by only a few
savage tlascalans in the valley of otumba
fought two hundred thousand aztecs 

   the valley was white with our cotton ar-
mor it was full of fighting men it was
one white god against a thousand of my
people a hundred of my fathers died on
eveiy spanish sword twenty thousand
were slain the tired spaniards ach with
a new wound were dying hard when cortez
twice wounded plowing on horseback
through the battle with his own hand killed
cihauca our chief like sheep from the
wolves flew the aztecs the valley was
empty the spaniards had won

  seiior when troubles pile upon you re-
member cortez at otumba yes remem-
ber cortez at otumba

  then with more men from over the salt
waters and aided by our slaves back they
came for seventy-five hungry bloody
days seiior they once more soaked our
streets and temples with aztec blood the
largest greatest city in the new world they
leveled to the mud my people were slaugh-
tered our emperor guatemozin they cap-

tured tortured and hung after sweet false
words of sworn safety

  seiior americano my people in our
capital made the most desperate defense in
history men died before roman arms
seiior but not like my people then the
men alone simply died fighting our war-
riors used their wives for food women ate
their babies the men and boys with bare
breasts and empty hands the women with
their children in their arms leaped from the
housetops down onto the spanish spears to
bun- them to smother the slaughtering
fiends under heaps of dead to drown them
in our blood

  for an hour after the fighting the
parched spaniards could not drink so clot-
ted with our blood were the running waters

    the spartans in the pass died before the
persian that their wives and children city
and country might live in peace the sea
moans beside their marble-but we are for-
gotten we the aztecs ate our wives and
children destroyed our city perished with
our country we did this thing from choice

    honorable surrender with freedom was
always open to us but even our children
died fighting at length the time came
when weak and helpless we could fight no
more the few left alive did not surrender
they were captured then enslaved who
weeps for the aztecs 

    h-s-s-s  the indians breath hissed
between snarling teeth but they found
no gold we laughed at them then died
beneath their dripping steel our lake had
our gold-ha ha ha 

   the voice of the aztec rang out over the
desert in fierce exultation from the dis-
tance the snarling jangle of a coyote an-
swered like an echo the wild laugh awoke
the sleeping girl she stirred uneasily
slowly opened her eyes then smiled drows-
ily at mason

   she rolled closer into the coat cuddled
nearer and caressingly patted his mocca-
sined foot with her fingers lightly touched
it with her lips pressed her cheek to it for
a pillow blinked at vacancy and with a
sleepy sigh was dreaming again the az-
tec was silent his gleaming eyes piercing
the horizon

  it was all so strange so wild so-
looking down at the black silky head on
his foot the fresh fascinating face the
perfect form the fairy foot mason knew
why mark antony gave the roman emt
pire for such a woman
mason the grizzly



   civilization or mexie-which

   mason wanted both but both were im-
 possible remove the jewel from its set-
 ting and its luster would be lost others
 had done it turned to another race for the
 sake of a foreign woman why not he
 he had no other ties

    after many battles broke in the
 aztec the spanish csesar sent less than
 one million dollars to his king

   the voice was low the tone was bitter
 the blood of montezuma ran riot in the
 moody aztec

   a french privateer captured the span-
 ish galleont-and francis the first the
 french king had the gold and laughed
 at the spanish rage once cortez sent a
 gold and silver cannon to spain senor
 worth two hundred and fifty thousand dol-
 lars that was for show

   from such deceits grew the stories of
 my aztec fathers enormous wealth in
 gold and silver we were as poor then as
 now only in manhood were we rich our
 mines we knew not nor how to work them
 what gold we had senor came from the
 streams and where the lodes were rich on
 the surface the great stores of gold and
 silver that came from mexico were mined
 by the spaniards themselves senor the
 demon is dead an aztec rules once more
 in mexico where montezuma sat now
 is diaz

   senor a light my thanks to you
 my friend the fire-the fire on my ciga-
 rette is dead i forget everything senor
 but my tale is done

   when cortez sailed for spain he had
 ohiy two million dollars in gold and silver
 treasure and half of that was his kings
 but he had five emeralds seiior carved by
 my people into shapes of flowers buds and
 bells they alone were worth one million
 dollars and were coveted by the spanish
 queen

   we had no steel we knew nothing of
 iron although it was all about us tin
 and copper we used hardened in a way
 now forgotten - a lost art they call it
 senor we cut the emerald with it senor
 except to the value perhaps of ten million
 dollars all the gold and silver in mexico
 has been taken from the rocks by white
 hands of the ten million my aztec
 fathers had a little of it is the worlds
 some was lost in battle and shipwreck the
 rest is in the lake for the lost mines of

to be c

montezuma seiior seek no more-it would
be labor lost

   the aztec arose dropped his serape on
the sleeping girl and left them think-
ing thinking thinking-masons eyes and
thoughts roamed the cold desert and the
perforated heavens his foot grew numb
and cold to move was to disturb the
breathing bronze

  the moon set the coyotes and the
prairie-owls left them cold dark silence
came dazzling white the morning broke
mason had not moved yet his thoughts
had searched the universe

  foolish perhaps yet for him mexie
had once done the same and would do it
again had he not the hot moon to sleep
while she fanning him watched the sheep

   in the indian the desert and the night
mason lived and loved that of which civ-
ilization does not dream there was some-
thing that lured his nature

   when the sun burst over the sandy hori-
zon like the throat of a raging cannon
when the sky grew brassy and the lizards
crawled from the griddle rocks the anglo-
saxon shook himself his conscience was
growling all that day he was more sullen
than even his ugly host mexie coaxed
like a kitten mason brooded like a bear

  go go go he must when the
shadows were stretching for the east mason
saddled his horse the aztec rolled a ciga-
rette mexie drew a dagger from her garter
and hid it in her sleeve

  then mason holding bis bronco by the
bridle stood before them

  where go you senor asked the
aztec

  to find the mines of montezuma

    but there are no mines of montezuma
senor what will you do

   find better ones

  the aztec shrugged his shoulders
mexie leaped for mason quick as she
was the spring - steeled northerner was
quicker he-caught the flash of her arm
held it for an instant as gently but as
firmly as a plaster cast and kissed his
hand

  then he swung into the saddle-and
rode away

  before a lone herders dugout on the
desert sat a man and a girl the mans
cigarette had been cold for an hour the
girl watched a speck ride into the setting
sun

observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no  - sometimes christmas cheer has the right-of-way over all
things and sometimes it gets switched on a blind
siding and stays there

 w-erry christmas mr

iwwv railroader wherever you
are and a happy new

                   these are the bell-ring-
ing home-coming days and
only the joyous shouts of the children break
the brooding peace of the world

  again-merry christmas whether in
station tower-or on the road

  some one must shout it 

  some one must bawl you out mr santa
claus with all your sly tricks and showy
doings and surprises some one must re-
mind them of you for they have almost for-
gotten you mr santa-the train-crew the
vard-crew and the station-crew

j	

  you are no cotton-whiskered fraud to
them mr santa because all they remember
about you was your doings when they were
boys they have never seen you since mr
santa claus they hear of you and eager
and exaggerated stories come to them from
the children at home but this holiday time
with it feasting and gift-giving and subtle
suggestion of sacredness is not for them

  for around this time the days are short-
est traffic is the heaviest and all the regu-
lars and reserves are called out to fight the
snow and cold and keep the business moving

  the coaches and the stations are crowded
people are going home the baggage-
trucks are piled high with trunks and grips
the expressman labors under a mountain of
unsorted and unchecked packages the
ticket-agent has an eager and impatient

serics began in the july  railroad

  throng at his window the trains become
  later at every station and the passengers
  implore the conductors not to miss their con-
  nections

     but they do miss and the passengers cry
   out in vexation trunks go wrong in the
   rush packages are lost and there are woes
   and worry and wrath for the dull ear of the
   overworked transportation man

    so-merry christmas mr transporta-
  tion man 

     we are shouting it two weeks ahead of the
   timely hour for if we waited until the sea-
   sonable moment you would return a cynics
   sneer and heap some guttural imprecation
   on our heads for there can be no  merry 
   anything when the multitude rushes upon us
   and overwhelms us with its demand for
   attention and service

     nevertheless these busy men have their
   christmas experiences and many of them
   are worth narrating this brings us to the
   story of  bud  browns christmas dinner

     bud has run an engine on our road for a
   number of years	-

      do you know bud said his wife one
   december day  we have been married ten
   years christmas day and we have never
   had a christmas dinner together every
   christmas day you have been on the road
   or have just come in or are just going out
   next thursdays christmas again bud
   cant we arrange it to have a big christmas
   dinner and have our folks with us and you
   be here bud 

 i cant lay off molly said bud  they

mans maf-azinc single eopics  cents


observations of a country station-agent



are very short of engineers theres always
a lot of them sick this time of the year
business is awful heavy right now the
corn crop is moving i think id have to be
sick but maybe i can arrange it some way
to get in well try it molly

  and so it was arranged

  next day bud explained it to the road
foreman of engines who promised to do what
he could and bud went out to chicago with
a drag

  it was only a few days until christmas
at home molly and the children had en-
tered into the spirit of the christmas-day
feast and the family reunion with great
interest there was much planning and
buying and scheming and enthusiasm of de-
tail all with the central idea that bud would
be with diem

  in buds home it was a great event if
bud had been an exile of timbuctoo for
years and this was his liberation and home-
coming the children would have been in no
greater commotion or expectancy it is the
way of the human heart the greatest
pleasures that come to any of us are the

little things that spring from our family
affections

  bud as an honored guest was determined
to be there

  he returned from chicago in the night
and was called for a trip east the next fore-
noon after the usual rest at the end of
this trip bud took out a ridgeville turn
which brought him back to the east-end
terminal the following day

  bud could now figure his movements and
probable whereabouts on christmas day
with some degree of certainty

   if he got out on his regular turn he would
get home the evening before and this would
mean he would be called christmas morning

   bud used a little diplomacy

  all the trainmen lived at the other end
and were always anxious to get out on the
first opportunity for the return trip

   bud swapped his turn with a later arrival
when he came up again he swapped once
more

  his behavior was a mystery to the other
trainmen he was accused of plying for a
better engine or for the merchandise run

             this is wednesday the th  well of all things

the railroad mans magazine

the general opinion however was that bud
had one  batty because no one in his
right mind would lay over at that end of
the line of his own choice

   bud squandered three opportunities but
made no explanations then he figured it
out that the fourth turn would put him out
early in the evening and land him at home
christmas morning before noon at the very
latest

   thereupon although besieged and impor-
tuned all other trades were declared off and
bud got under way at ten oclock the night
before with  all she could pull

   now fate in the affairs of man has many
inscrutable ways beyond the understanding
of a railroader

   bud crowded her but the engine behaved
badly and the despatcher gave him two bad
stabs

  at seven oclock in the morning he was
still fifty miles out and on a siding

  he walked down to the tower and sent
this message to the roundhouse to be phoned
to his wife

  am coming ought to be there about
  eleven	bud

  he got away at length but he had an-
other bad meeting-point and at ten oclock
he had co-ered only half the distance then
he sent another telegram

   wait for me cant get in till twelve

                                    bud

   at twelve bud was ten miles out and had
made his last stop

   he sent another telegram to molly

   hold everything molly ill be there a
   little after one	bud

   then he sent this message to the round-
house clerk

   telephone oconnells livery-stable to have
   a cab at roundhouse for me at one oclock

                          bud brown

    hey  yelled the operator as bud was
climbing back on the engine the round-
house operator wants to know if it is the
ambulance you want and if any one is
hurt 

  no yelled bud its a cab
c-a-b 

   and he says your wife wants to know
whats the matter with you  

   she knows  yelled bud

  bud answered the rear signal and once
more got under way

  there were no further delays of conse-
quence

  bud got off his engine at the ash-pit and
made out his time-slip on the jump tossing
it in to the roundhouse clerk without stop-
ping

  a cab awaited him and bud tossed the
driver a dollar

  drive to  high street he shouted
if you can make it in eight minutes keep
the change

  the cabby made it in seven minutes and
thirty seconds-faster time than bud had
made on the trip in but with better padding
for the jolts

  bud sprang out eagerly and ran up the
steps

  im here molly he cried i made
it its only a little after one 

  a strange quiet was over the house

   bud what in the world is the mat-
ter exclaimed molly they have been
telephoning me all morning i didnt know
what it meant i am so nervous

  why molly the christmas dinner
you know gasped bud i made it i
got here he went on half appealingly
you havent forgotten it have you mol-
ly

  molly waved her hand despairingly

  why bud brown you stupid thing
this isnt christmas this is the day be-
fore this is wednesday the th well
of all things 

  bud stared at her with open-mouthed
stupidity

   aint to-day-

  then he stopped

   molly ill wash if youll fry me some
eggs and some of the bacon ill go up-stairs
and go to bed ive been up all night
theyll be after me before morning

  late in the day he was asleep molly
tiptoed to the stair door and heard the heavy
regular breathing that tells the forgetful-
ness of all things-christmas railroading
and all the little joys and petty disappoint-
ments of our lives-then she sat down and
ciied softly and silently

  bud was called at four oclock christ-
mas morning and went out with a train of
coal for chicago

  early christmas morning the folks came
in from the country finding that bud
could not be at home molly and the chil-
observations of a country station-agent



dren were persuaded to return with them and
spread the feast and have the days fes-
tivities at the old homestead in the country
buds house was deserted

  thirty miles out buds engine went
wrong it sulked and balked on christmas-
day service bud did all an engineer could

  let me use your phone  cried bud

   hallo central give me oconnells
livery-barn hallo oconnell this
oconnell i want a rig-a good stepper

to be there by noon engineer brown-
high street come right-

thats a fine christmas grouch you got grinned the waiter

 do but she would not steam they got into
 clear and another engine was ordered out to
 take the train

   bud took the cripple back home he
sent a message to molly

    coining back be there about ten bully

                                      bud

   he returned it was about ten when he
rushed up to the house the blinds were
down and the door was locked bud raced
to the rear of the house and shook the
fastenings with an impotent fury

   molly molly he cried

   a neighbor appeared at her back door

    shes gone mr brown explained the
 woman her folks came in early this
 morning and took her and the children out
 to the country

   mr brown  mr brown the call-
boys after you says quick

   oconnell wait a minute keep your
ear there

  bud went out and held a brief conference
with die call-boy

  never mind oconnell i wont use the
rig ive changed my mind im not
going

  in anodier half-hour bud was in the cab
of a passenger engine and behind him was
a single coach

   youve got to turn her some bud ex-
plained the conductor  everythings to be
out of our way weve got just two hours
and ten minutes for one hundred and fif-
teen miles go to it bud twelve-thirty
in the union depot at chicago thats the
program bud


the railroad mans magazine

  bud was in daredevil humor old santa
himself is supposed to have a reindeer fleet-
ness that is some going but with all his
years of training for this particular day
bud left him far far behind until the mid-
winter haze swallowed him up

  bud pulled into the union depot a shade
under the two hours and the next day the
papers published his picture

  a lone passenger got out of the coach
as he hurried outside the gate bud heard
the joyous commotion of meeting

   hey bud  said the conductor
 heres a five-dollar gold piece that fel-
low said to give it to you

  whats all this excursion anyway
asked bud

  why that fellow come up from the
south and missed his connections and got
marooned a hundred and fifteen miles from
home says hes never missed a christmas
dinner with his wife and children  christ-
mas only comes once a year says he  and
there wont be many years  so when he
saw he couldnt do it any other way he just
hired this special train cost him about a
hundred or a hundred and fifty hes a
sentimental sort of fellow  think id dis-
appoint them and me too for that  he
asked well we landed him here all right
didnt we old scout

  a litde later bud was sitting on a high
stool in a restaurant

   give me a hamburg sandwich and a cup
of coffee hows that mince pie-this
months or last say for christmas din-
ner you ought to have real cream for this
coffee funny how these doughnuts turn
to stone after thirty days aint it these
chicago cockroaches are greedier than those
down in indiana over there theylet the
patron break bread first here they beat
him to it

   thats a fine christmas grouch you
got grinned the waiter

   theres a reason growled bud

  molly is saving the gold piece some
christmas day when the cards run right
it is to buy a christmas dinner and bud
is to carve the turkey

  there is a thriving little town in the
west on a certain railroad tom dixon
was sent there in the dual capacity as rail-
road and express agent

  about the same time a very charming
and sensible little girl arrived in this same
place to teach in the public school

  tom met her a number of times and at
once laid in some tailored clothes six neck-
ties of variant hues and a change of hats
she cast a witching eye at tom and in
time tom held her hand

  then tom confided to a friend that a
young man could not save any money galli-
vanting and pirouetting around in the folly
of the single state and that he could never
amount to anything or get anywhere until he
married and had the help of a good woman

  the friend assured tom that was true

  that is one of the nice qualities of a close
friendship it can be depended upon to en-
courage and justify anything on which you
set your heart it has the pleasing quality
of agreeing with you and of taking your
view of concurring assenting and approv-
ing that is the reason it is so stimulating
to confide in a friend in moments of per-
plexity the friend tells us what we want
to hear because we put the case to him in
a way that brings an amiable concurrence

  but in toms case the friend was right
a young man of good intent steady pur-
pose and sufficient income should marry a
good girl

  there are twenty-five good and sufficient
reasons

   first

  well anyway tom married the little
 schoolmarm

  they got along well together they
saved a little money-not much but a little

  the little girl schemed and managed and
they began to see their way to the points of
sending for a bungalow book and to no-
tice fancy gables contorted dormers and
pergolas

  then christmas day was coming along
and tom began wondering what he could
buy her he went over every page of the
department-store catalogue he inspected
the chinasets and the cut glass and alu-
minum outfits silver tableware and furs

  tom reasoned it all out she is such a
sensible girl no ornamental gevv-gaws for
maggie no foolish flubdubbery some-
thing useful every day for her this
brought him at length to the patent sweeper
and the galvanized bread-mixer

  one day early in december a little
sealed package from chicago came to toms
office and into toms hands

  he startled a little to see that it was
addressed to his wife mrs tom dixon
in a masculine hand

  it bore a conspicuous red-letter poster
observations of a country station-agent



not to be delivered or opened until christ-
mas day

  what the thunders this said tom
turning it over and over who would be
sending maggie anything from chicago
wonder whose handwriting that is
f tom inspected the package with the keen-
est perplexity value fifty dollars huh
i cant understand it 
i tom put the package in
the safe but he got it out
again examined the seals
and slyly tried to pry one
of them loose but it held
faithful to its trust

 then he adroitly ques-
tioned his wife about her
relatives and friends to find
a clue to one whose interest
in maggie would indicate a
christmas value of fifty
dollars with barren results
until one day - a-ha - a
woman cannot keep anything

one day she let out a little-
not much but enough tom-
quick-eared and nimble-wit-
ted put this and that to-
gether and guessed the rest

  there was a young man
a dear friend with whom
maggie had gone to school

he was now in chicago it
was a childish romance-
almost forgotten he was
prospering and-

  tom walked back to the
office very erect looked hard
ahead and clutched his fists

  that fellow knows maggies married
because he used my name in addressing that
package he muttered  if that snipe goes
to butting in on my preserves therell be
some doings he swelled with indigna-
tion that parasite never thought that
anything expressed to my wife would pass
through my hands i dont blame maggie
but shes a woman and these little atten-
tions would please her and will revive
friendships that cant do any one any good
but good fortune has placed the matter lie-
fore me and its up to me to nip the affair
in the bud

  tom once more took the little package
out of the safe he had turned it over so
many times that the edges were soiled

  this time burning with a curiosity that
could no longer be restrained and impelled

by a fierce conviction of duty the sharp
blade of toms office-knife lifted the seals
and the outer wrapper was removed

   this revealed another package similarly
 sealed and on which was written

  the seals on this package cannot be re-
stored if from some unworthy curiosity any
meddler should pry into it his telltale marks
will be left

him were visions of opals amethysts

         and rubies

   nevertheless tom removed this and
 found a third on which was written

    the contents within this little box are only
 for the eyes of mrs dixon and arc to be
 seen by no one else

 tom clutched it almost savagely and tore
 it open

 he hardly knew what to expect but be-
 fore him were fierce visions of opals ame-
 thysts and rubies

 he found nothing but a carefully-folded
 little note that fell to the floor

 tom picked it up smoothed it out and
 read with a half-aloud eagerness

    this is the most foolish letter ever writ-
 ten it is written by a foolish girl but it will
 never be read by any one but the same foolish
 girl who wrote it and will be read by her


the railroad mans magazine

christmas day to remind her how vain and
foolish she is from childhood she has
wanted a diamond ring they told her she
had pretty fingers and she thought foolish
little girl how pretty a diamond ring would
look on one of them but she could never
buy it and there was no one else that knew

  men do not understand how some simple
little fancy tugs at a womans heart-some
vagary-some little humor or conceit which
she never outgrows and which is never grati-
fied or satisfied i could not tell this to tom
poor boy he works so hard and denies him-
self so many things and we manage so closely
to get along to have a little to put away

package alone im a chump and a fool
i lost my head suspicious of - hang it
i cant get that package together again
shell know i pried it open maybe i
could burn the depot or blow up the safe
and save myself by making away with it in
that way why didnt i have gumption
enough to keep my fingers off

  tom thought a long while - but there
was only one way out

  he deliberately gathered up the torn
remains and stuck them into the fire

vou have such cold feet you know tom

  this letter is written by the foolish little
girl to remind her that on the day when gifts
are given and the fancy comes back the strong-
est that she is to forget for all time that her
fingers are pretty-that there are such things
as diamond rings and that empty show and
vanity are not for the wife of as good a hus-
band as tom

  that was all

 tom got up and stood with his back to
 the stove and his hands behind him

  i reckon im a durned chump

 then he paused

  i wish id had sense enough to let that

the  not-to-be-opened-until-christmas 
package went up in one brief exultant roar

then he got out the jewelers catalogue
that had found its way in the express office
and turned to diamond rings

any railroad man with regular employ-
ment can purchase a diamond ring on the
same terms as a typewriter-five down and
so much per month until paid tom ap-
proached the proposition from that angle

   by the way maggie said tom uncon-
cernedly one day  i got a small express
package for you from chicago


observations qf a country station-agent



   for me exclaimed maggie opening
wide her innocent eyes

    its sealed and marked valuable and
has a label on it  do not open until christ-
mas id better keep it till then in the
office safe women are mighty curious
and i dont believe you could keep it in
the house without breaking the seal and
taking a peep at the inside

  i am so curious tom i wonder who
would send me anything what does it
look like

   oh it looks like it might contain a
couple dozen sticks of chewing - gum and
maybe theres a tin stick-pin with a win-
dow-glass setting for me said tom with
careless levity

  tom have you opened it

   opened a package addressed to you
and plainly marked  do not open until
christmas maggie do you think i am
that mean

   of course not said maggie but i
am so curious tom maybe it had better
be kept in the safe until christmas i will
be guessing every minute you must keep
it at the office tom you are strong and
i am weak i dont believe i could resist
the temptation but you must understand
one thing tom dixon smiled maggie
you are under suspicion all the time
its not my doings said tom soberly
tom look me in the eye

   thats straight maggie

   every day maggie plied him with eager
questions and tom with a sort of lan-
guid interest assured her the gift was safe
and undisturbed

  christmas morning came and maggie
with tense fingers tore the seals and found
a diamond ring

    oh tom she cried with hysterical
joy you should not have done this for
me its so kind and so nice of you tom
but we cant afford it we cant indeed

   ive wanted a diamond ring ever since
i was a little girl but i never let you know
how i yearned for one - did i tom
what a mind-reader you are tom it
has always been my one weakness-a dia-

mond ring i never told any one tom
only mrs hatch the language teacher
she knows i talked to her about it many
times i roomed with her you know she
is such a clever woman

  isnt it funny tom last month a
bunch of us girls were at her home and
she told our fortunes she held my hand
and said what pretty fingers christ-
mas day you will receive a diamond ring
from your husband

   it has come true she said it would
she held communion with the ginx and
they told her there was a way and to leave
it to her  i never tell fortunes little girl
she said  that do not come true mrs
hatch is such a very very clever woman
tom there isnt anything that would please
me more tom dixon ill bet mrs hatch
put you up to this

  mrs hatch gasped tom did she
wri- oh hang mrs hatch im mighty
glad youre pleased maggie-theres noth-
ing too good for you

  the clever mrs hatch clever indeed
in thus putting one over on tom

  tom preserved a sheepish silence mrs
hatch was immensely delighted that mag-
gie had a diamond ring - and maggie
doesnt know the rest of it

  now see what i have for you tom
exclaimed maggie two pairs of socks
of soft saxony yarn i knit them myself
they will be so much warmer than those
you buy you have such cold feet you
know tom

  tom sat in his office it was near the
close of christmas day

  his feet were on his desk and he smoked
a cigar in a leisurely meditative way be-
tween his shoe-tops and his pants bottoms
there was a startling exposure of saxony
yarn-and there was more circumference
in one ankle than the other for she knit
them herself

  talk about women voting said tom
thumping the ashes from his cigar  they
ought to be in politics when it comes to
turning tricks a woman can give a man
every card in the deck and beat him out

most men use their energy for the days work but some careful
souls save it all for the sprint to the pay-car do you -

growls of the gang boss
bill nyes appeal for a pass

bill nye of the boomerang is publishing a
complete letter writer in serial form in
a recent issue he says

  our first letter will be in the form that should
be used in addressing a soulless corporation relative
to a pass

       office of freedoms bugle horn
wahoo neb february  
to hon j q a gall general passenger
and ticket agent j i m c r o w rv
chicago iii

  dear sir-unfortunately you have never ex-
perienced the glad thrill and holy joy of my ac-
quaintance

  you have groped through the long and dreary
heretofore without that solemn gladness that you
might have enjoyed had providence thrown you in
the golden sunlight of my smile

  i have addressed you at this moment for the
purpose of ascertaining your mental convictions
relative to an annual pass over your voluptuous
line the bugle horn being only a semi-annual
you will probably have some little reservation about
issuing an annual on the strength of it

  this however is a fatal error on your part

  it is true that this literary blood-searcher and
kidney-polisher if i may be allowed that chaste
and eccentric expression does not occur very
often but when it does shoot athwart the jour-
nalistic horizon error and cock-eyed ignorance
begin to yearn for tall grass

  you will readily see how it is in my power to
throw your road into the hands of a receiver in a
few days it will occur to you instantly that with
the enormous power in my hands something should
be done at once to muzzle and subsidize me the
bugle horn stands upon the pinnacle of pure and
untarnished independence her clarion notes are
ever heard above the din of war and in favor of the
poor the down-trodden and the oppressed still
it is my solemn duty to foster and encourage a few
poor and deserving monopolies

  i have already taken your road and so to speak
placed it on its feet time and again i have
closed my eyes to unpleasant facts relative to your
line because i did not wish to crush a young and
growing industry i can point to many instances
where hot-boxes and other outrages upon the
traveling public have been ignored by me and al-
lowed to pass by

  last fall you had a washout at jimtown which
was criminally inexcusable in its character but i
passed silently over the occurrence in order that
you might redeem yourself one of your conduc-
tors an over-grown bald-headed pelican from
laramie a man of no literary ability and who
could not write a poem to save his soul from per-
dition once started the train out of wahoo when
i was within i of a mile of the depot and left

me gazing thoughtfully down the track with a
one-hundred-and-fifty-pound trunk to carry back
home with me

  what did i do did i go to the telegraph-office
and wire you to stop the train and kill the con-
ductor with a coal-pick did i cut short his
unprofitable life and ruin the road with my cruel
pen no sir

  i hushed the matter up i kept it out of the
papers as far as possible in order that your soulless
corporation might have a new lease of life

  another time when my pass and purse had ex-
pired at about the same time and i undertook to
travel on my voluptuous shape a red-headed con-
ductor whose soul had never walked upon the sun-
lit hills of potent genius caught me by the bosom
of my pants and forcibly ejected me from the train
while it was in motion and with such vigor and
enthusiasm that i rolled down an embankment one
hundred feet with frightful rapidity and loss of
life

  a large bottle of tansy and sweet spirits hear
my prayer which i had concealed about my person
to keep off malaria and rattlesnakes was fright-
fully crushed and segregated besides this my
feelings were hurt and outraged and so was the
portico of my pantaloons

  others would have burned down a water-tank
or dusted off the crossing with the mangled corpse
of the general passenger-agent but i did not i
bound up my bleeding heart and walked home
beneath the cold stars and forgave the cruel
wrong

  i now ask you whether in view of this you will
or will not stand in the pathway of your com-
panys success will you refuse me a pass and
call down upon yourself the avalanche of my burn-
ing wrath or will you grant me an annual and
open up such an era of prosperity for the j i m
c r o w railway as it never before knew

  do you want the aid and encouragement of the
bugle horn and success or do you want its oppo-
sition and a paupers grave beneath the blue-eyed
johnny-jump-ups in the valley

  ostensibly i am independent and fearless but
if you are looking around for a journal to subsi-
dize do not forget the number of my post-office
box i have made and unmade several railroads
already and it makes me shudder to think of the
horrible fate which awaits you if you hold your
nose too high and stiffen your official neck

  should you enclose the pass i would be very
grateful to you for any little suggestions during
the year as to what my fearless and outspoken
opinion should be relative to your company

  hoping to hear fron you favorably in the con-
tiguous ultimately i beg leave to wish you a very
pleasant bon vivant very sincerely yours

jethra rikers new year

by robert fulkerson hoffman

       another year comes jubilantly sounding to the
       caboose and wakens memories of another day

 tk ncle jethra riker

              ruddy of face white of
beard and hair weary
guardian of his own cat-
tie rumbling on ahead sat
dozing peacefully with his
rickety armchair tipped back rakishly
against the rear wall of the caboose con-
ductor spangler under the sidelight at his
desk silently checked his brief list of red-
ball freight and high in the cupola sat the
flagman watching ahead the pulsing end-
less struggle of a little light against a
mighty ever-closing darkness

  above the vibrant silence of the caboose
engulfing it making it actively alive there
came suddenly a low moaning from the
front mingling with the distant thunder-
ous roll of the engines exhaust it mounted
quickly into a bubbling rollicking succes-
sion of giant shoutings that went hurtling
away across the dim snow-fields chuck-
ling and gurgling echoes came rolling back
from the icy mountainheads to join in a
jubilant shriek that chattered the frosted
window-panes of the caboose in their fas-
tenings uncle jethras chair squared itself
with a thud upon the floor and he stood
bolt upright in the shocked strength of his
rugged six-feet-two

  whats that he demanded reaching
hastily for his discarded hat  do you
suppose theres anything wrong with them
cattle  

  as though for answer two last high
blasts from the engine-whistle came rolling
back and the cannonade of exhausts from
the stack boomed steadily out into the night

  that said spangler turning from his
finished work and calmly consulting his
watch  is  coon  connors way of an-

nouncing that we have just crossed the line
into the new year sit down and be happy
uncle happy day 

  without answer riker turned to the rear
door of the caboose and threw it wide to let
in a brief sweep of the clean frosty air
with the red light from the rear platform
flooding his face with its soft glow from
below the crinkles deepened at the corners
of his quizzical eyes until he had wholly
recovered from the quick fear for his cattle
he stood looking far out into the night as
one might fancy a sturdy old norseman
gazing across a darkened sea of ice with
a great glad breath of the clear air he
closed the door and sat again saying

  yes so it is happy day i ought to
remember i was in jail once on new
years did you ever start out with your
whole bein filled to overflow with good in-
tentions and fetch up in jail-on new
years

  not since ive been on this run uncle
i swear it  replied spangler with a smile
that seemed to be reflected from the old
mans face

    me nuther said riker  but i used to
run my cattle to chicago stead of el paso
only and thats some different you see
he continued filling his pipe and passing the
pouch to spangler  id been living in texas
thirty years and been homesick in a way
all that time-if you can rightly sense that
went out a poor boy from the bitter early
days of a wabash river farm took root
down there and got to be the father of men
children and owner of a thousand acres
same as now without ever going back to
where id come from

   so it come one more winter when i
had cattle needing market and i headed


the railroad mans magazine

them for chicago meaning to go on around
by the wabash coming back there was
seeming good reasons why id never gone
before but theres two tilings that was al-
ways calling to me to come back

   one was the rustle of leaves on a big
sycamore that stood on a knoll by the
wabash and shadowed the quiet spot where
my mother had slept long as i could re-
member i had dreamed my lonely boy-
dreams there in rare idle minutes and i
wanted to stand there again and sort of sum
up what of them had come true

   the other was the side-porch of homer
allens store where mrs allen used to
mother me some when id drove in with a
load of farm-stuff and her little tike of a
boy lincoln used to climb all over me and
hug me and make me cry for the sheer lone-
liness of what id just come from i want-
ed to see that boy-boy or man

    so i left home with the cattle soon after
christmas all went fine and day before
new years i cashed them in at chicago
for forty-seven hundred dollars and left
the yards wadi a nice-seeming fellow who
said hes from kansas we rid into the city
together and had a real enjoyrable talk

    he told me a lot about his folks and i
told him some about mine seems hes got
more folks than me so i tells him some
about my neighbor crockett to fill in like
and how im to look up hallie crockett
whos been doing well in chicago for a spell
back and get a first-hand word for her
people

    i left the fellow in the station and im
over in jackson street aiming to get me a
ticket hunt up hallie and land me on the
wabash next day for new years im set
on that last most of all and not looking
out as sharp as i might in such a crowded
runway when theres a shortish smooth-
looking fellow of mebbe thirty-eight years
bumps me half off the sidewalk going in the
same direction

   it riled me and i turned meaning to
bat him across the ears same as youd bat
an unruly yearling calf but a square sight
of him changed me a mite and what he said
done more

  never mind you listen uncle riker
interrupted himself to say with a wide
sweep of the hand

  spanglers meaningful laugh had nettled
him

  that young man was togged out in a
long cape-overcoat shiny black boots and

a plug hat his face was round and putty-
white with close-lidded eyes like a turtle
thats watching you to see whether itll best
drop into the swamp or stay on the top side
of the log

   it wasnt a good face youll notice and
whats more when he swept back the right
wing of his cape and shoved out his hand to
shake i see a tuberose in his buttonhole and
got the smell of it

  now theres only two kinds of men
thatll wear a tuberose in their buttonhole
fur as i know-thats men thats already
dead and men that ought to be knowing
that i looked at him in sort of wondering
disgust stead of batting him as i should
have done and that give him a chance to
talk

     pardon me sir he says polite as
mexicans- pardon me sir i-why upon
my soul i believe it is-

     yes i says  it is you read my ear-
marks ok first gallop through the herd
but it dont happen to be your brand i reck-
on now supposin you git over to your
side of the line and i git to mine

    i stunned the fellow a mite with that
and was turning on my way when he broke
out with a fresh brand of apologies and
wound up with a pleading look and  you
are mr riker arent you much as you
have changed for the better i knew you in
an instant

  now that sort of got me and i was
mushy enough to say  yes i be who
are you to tell me about it 

     do you remember a little boy that used
to climb on your knee on allens side porch
says he  and how you used to set there with
your blue overalls on and your whiskers
just beginning to grow long enough for the
boy to pull one at a time how you used
to laugh and sometimes cry there 

     i do says i

   well says the fellow  im that little
boy im lincoln allen

    i aint going to tell you all else he told
me but that man told me things that i
diought nobody but myself knew he even
told me about the big sycamore and how
the water sounds washing along by the
grass-mound bank he told me about the
white stone that stands under the sycamore
and named word for word the verse of
scripture thats writ on it

    and all the time lies walking along
with me till ive most forgive him his face
and the tuberose and come to believe that
jethra rikers new year



hes little line allen grown up to be the
kind of man he said he was oh yes
hes a business man-very busy indeed-
and just when were a block or two away
from where he bumped into me a young
fellow came running up the sidewalk to
meet him

   this young fellow is wearing a black
skull-cap of silk or alpaca or the like and
has his hands full of memorandum and pen-
cil stuff-all business and excitement he
apologizes to me for the interruption and
then states his case quick about some rush
calls on sight drafts just come into the of-
fice three hundred dollars he must have
and have it quick

     lincoln allen as well call him didnt
hesitate a minute he reached under his
cape coat and hauled out a buckskin sack of
hard money handed it to the clerk and told
him to take out what he needed the clerk
counted out what looked to be three hun-
dred dollars in gold and handed the sack
back little lincoln restored the sack to
his inner pocket and despatched the clerk
upon his way

  the young fellow had run as much as
ten steps when allen called him back

    thats bad business he says  come
to think of it theres a premium on gold
just now we ought to have the advantage
of it stead of letting it go to our cor-
respondents mr riker could you pos-
sibly accommodate me with bills or silver
for the amount and take this gold until we
can walk round to the bank and exchange
it 

  now i aint making any argyment to
jestify my doings uncle riker again in-
terrupted himself to say as spangler
showed signs of another sardonic eruption
 im stating the bare facts of what i done

   when the clerk chinks them fifteen
twenty-dollar gold pieces back into lincolns
right hand and lincoln turns offering them
to me right here thinks i is where archie
really kills the bear if it aint little lincoln
and if it is lincoln-

   i thought of how mrs allen give me
pie and things when i sot on her porch
and about lincolns dancing blue eyes that
now looked a sort of dirty mouse-gray some-
how as i searched his face for some brand
id reconize

   i thought about the forty-seven hundred
in my inside pocket and stepped a little one
side into the angle of a building and set my
satchel down

   i dug down into my jeans and pulled
out three one-hundred-dollar bills that id
had left before i sold the cattle and i hand-
ed them to lincoln and took the gold he
handed them to the clerk and stooped to
pick up my satchel while i still held the
gold in my hand

   but something told me on the second to
beat him to it i grabbed up the satchel
with my other hand and the minute i
straightened up with my both hands full
it seemed like i got my full sense of heft
and i see what had been done to me the
clerk was gone in the crowd of the walk

     here i says without no frills and let-
ting the gold pieces skitter back into lin-
colns hand-all but one piece which i
palmed under my thumb and later slipped
into my vest-pocket- i dont want this
stuff its light

  you astonish me mr riker says
lincoln

    i reckon i do says i  and before
it strikes in too deep ill ask you to hand
over three hundred dollars in good money
or take the consekences right here

  why certainly certainly-if you pre-
fer it why my dear mr riker thats the
whole idee i want the gold you know and
if youll just walk around to the bank with
me well close up the whole deal in a jiffy
why certainly certainly

   wc went when we got to the bank
doors a block or two away he led in be-
tween the big stone columns of the entrance
stepped at a good road-gait through the
swinging doors and smashed that heavy
flapping door back in my face with me on
the outside it jarred me a lot

  then too when i was leaving home
mother and the boys kept coaxing at me to
wear jeds derby hat that jest fits me and
im that silly and vain that i done it when
the door hit me it bashed my face some and
staggered me backward while that fool hat
went bouncing around on the ground like a
sand-flea tetched with sunstroke

    by the time id corraled it and straight-
ened up theres two or three oily looking
gents standing between me and the bank
door and theyre crowding round and ask-
ing am i hurt am i hurt

   oh they was anxious all right-just
that anxious that i breshed em all aside
with one sweep and said  you mind your
own business

   i knowed by then that if i was to win
back id got to play my own game and play


the railroad mans magazine

it straight in my own way so i walks right
in and up the long shady chute to the
desk lincoln of course is nowheres in
sight i set my satchel down and i says
to die clean-looking young fellow behind the
brass grating  what bank is this son 
bank says he real civil not a
bank sir-this is the grand pacific hotel
what can we do for you  

  oh i says thats it eh well i
aint to say rightly acquainted with this part
of town i work my cattle mostly straight
between the transit house and home

    yes  he says  and what can we do
for you sir  

     well i says  is the proprietor in 

   n-o-o says the young fellow kind of
doubtful  but you can talk to me till he
comes if you like

    ive lost niv money says i and i
set out to tell him the whole right of it fair
and open

   id only got a little piece when he spoke
up soft and polite as he spoke all along

     frank  he says

    frank   i says not rightly catching
his meaning

    we dont breed any such plays as that
in this house he answers  and we dont
stand for it frank this is mr-

  riker i supplies soon as id took a
good square look into the eyes of a stocky
fellow thats pressing just the least bit
against my off-elbow

   theres nobody there the second before
but hes got something of the same look
about him that my oldest boy jed carries
and i know in a second that lies all right

   yes mr riker frank mr riker is
our guest for the present and you will enter-
tain him just sit down over yonder and
tell frank all about it wont you mr ri-
ker   says the clerk

   i reached right over to that young man
and took the pen from his hand i regis-
tered my name and brand same as id do
at the transit house sealed up my forty-
seven hundred dollars in an envelope and
took a receipt for it passed in my satchel
and the whole kit and went over in a shady
corner and sot down with frank without a
cent in my pocket

   we got along fine i told him the whole
works-about the fellow that was going back
to ohio to see his folks and all when it
come to me describing lincoln it was jest
like we was a pair of kids playing a game
silk hat says i

  topper says frank jotting it down
on a tally-pad

     putty-face says i

    poker-mug says frank

   and so it went

     turtle eyes

  blinker

     cape coat

   curtain

    right-handed

    one wing

   franks smiling broader and broader as
the game goes  till i says

    mebbe aint got no left hand never
showed it

  five-finger hannigan says frank
laughing ready to bust and jotting it down
 thats the answer uncle youre all
right if you everwant my kind of a job
come again and well fix you up now you
jest set here till i come back and dont you
stir i wont be gone long

   he went and i sot there quite a long
spell before it got so i had to either git up
and hustle round a mite or set up the long
yell jest to know i was still alive i mo-
seyed toward the clark street door and the
clerk shook his head at me but i waved
my hand at him so he smiled and i went
on

   id no moren got my nose out the door
than theres a nasty spiteful little gun-
crack snaps out up the street someeres and
the coveys of moving people on both sides
of the street fluttered for cover behind the
line of cabs thats standing along the curb
over along the old government building

   ever hear a gun crack in a crowded
street its a mighty sassy sound that
street was nigh about empty in two winks
and down my side come lincoln allen tear-
ing along minus his plug hat and his cape
coat but wearing his tuberose plain as a
tin star on a depety marshal while he looks
backard and makes motions with something
glinting in his right hand he aint got no
other hand its off at the wrist and the
stumps waving as he runs

   lose as he dares conies frank chasing
behind him dodging in and out among cabs
in the gutter with a big gun in his hand but
trying to draw lincolns last slug before he
closes in on him right

   lincolns got one of them dirty little
two-barrel affairs you see that shoots a
soft-nose slug and can be hid in your palm
and hes got rid of one shot as i reckon
it so i see its plain up to me
jethra rikers new year



    jest as he come abreast of the big stone
pillars im standing behind i hops out and
corrals him he proves hes an outlaw all
right for he twists that dinky little gun
up alongside my face and blows the roof
out of jeds derby slick as anything you ever
see and hung onto the gun while i downed
him

  then he turned a reglar branding-pen
trick on me by gitting his hind feet fair
under me while he laid and fought on his
back and he tossed me up surprising once
or twice

  but after id bashed him one or two
about the same size that the swing-door give
me and twisted the gun out of his hand he
was that biting with his cussing that i
jammed that little four-inch gun crossways
into his mouth and squshed it shet heavy
enough to stick when id got done hog-
tying him feet and right hand letting his
short wing flutter for luck i looked up and
seen frank standing over me in the rim of
the crowd that had closed in and hes laugh-
ing ready to drop

     uncle he says  youre sure all right
i dont mind telling you now that i was
born in texas lay still hannigan the
wagonll be here in a minute what do you
think of the texas game huh  

   ever been in that annex o perdition
that they call harrison street station-
down cellar theres nothing like it nor
approaching it down our way barring the
bear-pit in the abandoned zoological works
that texeden started in its boom days lem
baxter uses it now as headquarters for a
skunk farm and does his killing and pelt-
drying inside the spike-iron fence at the pit-
mouth but thats clean and fresh

   theres where we fetched up-harri-
son street jail me as a witness and lin-
coln because hed never been hung they
wanted me to give bail for my appearance
as complainant but i wasnt seeing my way
clear to let go of anything more in that
bunch i looked frank fair in the eye
and told the desk marshal i hadnt a peso
on me and didnt know when i would have
frank stood pat

     well says the fellow  theres nothing
to do then but hold you until we can get a
hearing

     ill play my hand says i

   take him down says the fellow and
i followed the lead till he opened a boiler-
plate door at the foot of the stairs

  say spangler the smell that come up

out of there-well let that go theres a
nigger down in there somewheres drunk and
yelling  shes ah loaded with bright angels
hallelu-yaa shes ah loaded-

  the nigger broke off with a strangling
yell and every coyote in the den set up a
ki-yi till it was like-well like that there
aint nothing else like it

   i poked my head inside the door in
time to see one of the depeties shut off an
inch-and-a-quarter stream from a nozzle
that hed turned on him and as soon as
the nigger got done choking and swearing
he changed his tune to  ah-roll ol jurdun
ah-roll 

   i backed out onto the lower step and
told the depety that was leading me if he
aimed to corral me in such a den o var-
mints as that id do my best to rip the in-
ternals out of the whole works with what
i said and what frank said between sort
of snickering behind me it comes that they
let me stay up-stairs with the reserves

   and there i am-spang and good in jail
next morning for new years jstead of
down on the wabash as id aimed to be

    first hearing next day yields up a con-
tinuance change of venue to a court seven
miles over on the west side harrison street
calendar crowded

    second hearing three days gone assays
a continuance of five days and change to
north halstead street-round trip fifteen
miles

   third hearing pans out continuance-
four days and changed to a court in cottage
grove avenue seven miles southeast round
trip fourteen miles

    course you see what fur spangler but
i was there every trip and still going when
theres some kind o rumpus breaks out one
day a little piece down the street from the
harrison street honkatonk and i slipped
out the door and took a look

  just around the next corner theres a
young boy throwing a fit on the sidewalk
hes wallering in the slime on the stones and
rising to his feet and falling his length as
fast as he can rise and tumble hes froth-
ing at the mouth and going on that bad that
it would make you plumb sad the big
marshal thats standing over him aint doing
a thing to help him and i sort o steps in

   but theres a decent-looking old man
grabs me by the arm and pulls me aside

 dont he says  the copd kill ye 

   he hung on till hed drawn me round
the corner and im a maverick if that old


the railroad mans magazine

rascal hadnt offered me a mangy hundred
dollars inside of two minutes if id pull
my freight and let up on lincoln allen i
never answered him im that disgusted and
i went straight hack to jail

  next day come the fourth hearing an
its in a place near by theres a good-
faced young fellow for judge hes setting
high and alone when we go in and just
below him with her back to us sets a young
woman scratching down court notes she
turns and looks at us when theyve all fin-
ished something then she lets out a little
choky squawk and comes bounding to the
top of the low flat-top railing just like she
used to hop into a box-stirrup onto her
pony and she landed fair with her arms
around my neck

  why uncle jethra riker she says
right out loud  you frightened me near-
ly to death where did you come from  

    jail i says  hallie jail but gentle
now its all right

   yes its hallie crockett all right and
while the court folks is getting things quiet-
ed down the judge picks up the papers in
our case and looks them over a whole lot
noting how we been swinging round the cir-
cle i reckon from what happens after

   spangler ive seen some quick deals-
san intone and way stations-but nothing
swifter than what follows he calls the
hull caboodle of us inside the rail-lin-
coln cappers coppers frank and me

    mr riker he says  do you remember
a little boy that-

  well that made me hot he didnt
look like one o the gang and it was disgust-
ing to have it pan out that way again

    i broke right in

     judge i says  if youll excuse lib-
erties i been through all that and a heap
more all i got out of it so fur is three
weeks in jail and this brass simoleon i
walked up and slapped the bogus twenty
down hard on his desk

     if your honor dont mind i says  id
be plumb happy to know whether this heres
jest another sign-camp or do we have the
final round-up right here 

    he hefted that nasty  gold and clinked
it on the oak while he looked all of us over
savage as wolves

     final round-up he says  officer i
will see all parties to this suit at once in
my chambers

  well the things he said to that bunch
in there shriveled em till you could see the

  wrinkles dropping off their horns he fin-
ished up on lincoln

  hannigan he says ive sent you
down to joliet until id be ashamed to make
out another commitment and youre al-
ways out soon we understand the why
too bad but we understand this time
you played me in to win against my old
friend jethra riker-but you overplayed
youi hand the federal court-

    i was setting straight up clutching my
hair by then spangler see where the trails
leading to sure as ever you held up a hobo
for a two-bit ride on a freight-truck that
judge is lincoln allen

     the federal court he goes on cool as
spring-water  has jurisdiction in this little
gold affair it is now eleven oclock i
shall not send this  coin  to commissioner
flint before two this afternoon if you are
inside his district at that time-i think you
know the rest the other is a minor matter
between you and mr riker well say for
the present

 jethy he says wringing my hand on
his way back to the bench  stop and talk a
moment on your way out glad to see you 
  lincoln i says to hannigan when
the judge is gone  lincoln-

  aw cut that says hannigan none
polite now

     theres good authority i says  fer
saying that if you slap a man on one cheek
-with an oak door-its liable to come back
to you a hundredfold but fer old times
sake if you and your gang will raise that
harrison street soap-fit ante about to the
tenth magnitude we can deal right here
with no more said theres a crisp thou-
sand-dollar bill comes fluttering down on
the table from somewheres in the gang gen-
tle as the drop of a leaf from the old syca-
more and its all over

   next day im standing under that bleak
old tree on the wabash and passing that

i never stop going till im back in texas

  when we found out from the crocketts
just how tilings stood we asked judge allen
to come down after the cermony and bring
hallie to see next june grass on the brazos 
he done it 

  with a yawn of deep content uncle jeth-
ra stretched his long arms high into the
cupola before rolling into the lower bunk
of the caboose to sleep the sleep of the just
and unvanquished until coon connor tore
the winter dawn to tatters with his new
years greeting for sleeping del sur

hat is the controlled manual block sys-
 tem and how is it operated-c f w
 boston

  it is a system through which the starting signal
for a train to enter a block is released by the
operator at the extreme end of that block-in fact
by the operator in the tower where the next block
starts-and this release cannot be effected if the
block is occupied by a train if a switch is open or
if a rail is broken for a complete description of
this and other block systems see the article  the
working of block signals in the railroad
mans magazine for november  it would
be impossible to do this interesting subject full
justice within the limited confines of this depart-
ment



eh l pittsburgh-we have delayed reply-

	ing to your interesting train-order prob-
lem longer than we should due to a vigorous
attempt on our part to secure a decided expression
of opinion from some authority this however
has not been forthcoming but the general view
of it is that the despatcher could run the special
as second   from gu to the junction of
the spur track on which regular    was at
that time operating and run him as first   
thence to margo this may not seem in accord-
ance with the provisions of your question in which

yoistate that the despatcher does not ordinarily
hear from regular    until she reaches margo
but is it likely that they would be allowed such
latitude you say that at the junction of all the
coal branches on which    has to work there
is a telephone and would it not be more consistent
railroading for them to notify the despatcher be-
fore backing out of the branch and receive his per-
mission 

  if this rule was in vogue it would be quite easy
to run the special as we suggested and annulled on
the coal branches if no means whatever existed
to communicate with   it would appear that
the special could not start until    reported
from margo

  we are not surprised when you say that this
had some  good ones  up in the air it had us
there too for a time and we can not say for a
certainty whether we are down or not until we
hear from you again if you will let us know-
just how this matter was handled we will be glad
to publish your original letter in full as it is very
interesting

  would give you or ourselves the assurance of cor-
  rectness the only explanation we ever heard for
  the two terms was that in the old days when loco-
  motives were lubricated by an oil-cup on each
  steam-chest it was the duty of the fireman to fill
  it from the tallow-pot when required and some
  times he had this to do when the locomotive was 
  in motion the name has also been applied as
  frequently to engineers in regard to the  hog-
  head freight locomotives were usually termed
   hogs  irrespective of design or weight thus you
  may infer that an engineer might easily receive
  this nickname maybe there is a better explana-
  tion of the origin of the two names if so will
  some of our friends please write us

fm hoboken new jersey-in regard to

	your question concerning the longest
  bridge in the world which we answered in a pre-
  vious number we have now unearthed another
  which is going to be hard to beat this bridge is
  on the norfolk and southern railroad across
  albemarle sound in north carolina it was
  started in march  and on january  
  trains were run across it is  feet  inches from
  the surface of the water and is five and seven-
  tenths miles long it has two draws one lift and
  one turn bridge the former being  feet in the
  clear these figures were furnished by one who
  was employed on this work and no doubt are
  correct



rg mount vernon new york-the trol-

	ley system particularly appealed on the road
  you mention through the elimination of danger
  from the third rail and there are also compelling
  arguments from the standpoint of maintenance
  and general operation in its favor now that the
  troubles have been corrected which were so much
  in evidence when the line was first installed there
  has never been any trouble to the wires arising
  from wind-storms and breaks are quickly re-
  paired it makes no difference in the voltage
  whether the current goes through a trolley-wire or
  through the third rail it is stepped down to
  what is required by transformers in the locomo-
  tive before reaching the motors

have frequently overheard engineers while
talking to one another make some allusion to
an engine dropping her plug will you
explain just what this expression means and in
particular just what the  plug  is and where it
is located-c j k port jervis new york

  it is a plug screwed into a brass thimble in the
crown-sheet of the locomotive fire-box the
sheet is directly over the fire and is normally
covered with water to a depth of about seven
inches this plug is made of an alloy of
lead tin and bismuth in such proportion as to
give the alloy a melting point somewhat higher
than the temperature of the water corresponding
to the steam-pressure carried it is intended to
prevent the destruction of the crown-sheet by over-
heating when the water drops to a dangerously
low level as the melting of the plug will allow the
steam to escape of late they have been largely
abandoned in railroad practise through their un-
reliability because the melting point of the alloy
often rises with long exposure to heat and scale
forming over the plug on the crown-sheet may re-
sist a high-boiler pressure after the plug itself
melts

does the cross-head of a locomotive move
backward in the guides or does it remain
stationary until it is in the back end of the
guides i know it moves forward for instance
when an engine is on the forward center and the
piston is all the way in if the engine is in the for-
ward motion and moves ahead will the cross-head
move back or will it stand still and the engine
move forward on the piston if that is so how
can the wheels revolve without drawing the cross-
head back when the cross-head is fastened to the
main-rod which is in turn attached to the driver
-e t southampton long island

   	you have liit on the idea exactly in the last
sentence of your question and practically returned
your own answer how would it be possible to
effect a revolution of the driving-wheels without
moving the cross-head a complete round trip in
the guides the idea about the cross-head stand-
ing still and the engine moving forward over it
is simply an absurdity and it is astonishing that
it should be given so much credence by men cer-
tainly qualified to know better however to
knock it in the head for your information and
many others who adhere to the fallacy we will
consider the action of a locomotive when mounted
on a testing-plant similar to the one at the st
louis exposition and the one maintained by the
pennsylvania railroad in its department of tests

   in this instance the locomotive is stationary on
the testing plant but through friction-rollers im-
by the light of the lantern



 pinging on the driving-wheels it is possible to re-
 produce road conditions the locomotive is run
 and fired exactly as though it was on the road and
 the service is equally hard but it does not move
 one inch you will note however that the cross-
 heads are flying through their respective sets of
 guide-bars and four exhausts issue from the stack
 at every revolution of the driving-wheels thus
 any one may appreciate that the locomotive does
 not move ahead over the cross-head and that the
 latter does move backward and forward

   the fact that four exhausts occur as above
 mentioned should be sufficient proof without
 reference to the testing-plant illustration it
 would be impossible for these to take place if the
 round trip of the cross-head did not occur at every
 revolution because they mark the outlet of the
 steam from each end of the two cylinders after it
 has performed its work this question comes to
 this department with wonderful regularity and
 we have explained it somewhat similarly on vari-
 ous occasions we trust now that our thought con-
 cerning the testing-plant will dismiss the matter

   	under ordinary conditions the brakes with
 the long piston travel would release first

   	it appears that you are correct in your in-
 terpretation of the matter that if train-line re-
 ductions are continued after the short-travel brakes
 were full set in order to set the long-travel ones
 on full the long-travel ones would release first but
 if no further reductions were made after the short-
 travel ones were set they would release together

   	if we understand your question this is
 provided for through the equalizing feature of the
 brake with which you are of course familiar it
 is always best and will assist us greatly if refer-
 ence is always made in these air-brake problems to
 the particular style of equipment under considera-
 tion pattern of brake-valve etc etc the more
 complete the description the more definite the
 answer as it is we frequently have to reply in
 generalities which do not fully inform

wm r biscoe north carolina-the in-

 	structions seem to be so very clear in the
 time-table and in the special explanatory instruc-
 tions that the matter should be in little doubt it
 would not appear that the inferior train had a right
 to the block without a    order you will note
 that the special instructions particularize that the
 block card does not give an inferior train the right
 over a superior train unless the inferior train has
 time-table rights or a   order therefore it
 would appear to us that the block card in this ar-
 rangement is merely intended as an additional pre-
 caution

i have been toid that copper ferrules or rings
used on the ends of boiler tubes were pri-
marily resorted to on account of a mistake
made by a boilermaker in boring his flue-sheet it
was bored larger than his flue and to save the
sheet he inserted a short piece of copper flue and
found it made a better joint than iron is there
any record of such being the case-g f pi
shreveport louisiana

  no record whatever while such a thing may
have happened and may have been corrected
through the means employed it would be an ah
surdity to assign this as the explanation for the
use of copper ferrules on the fire-box end of boiler-
tubes the ferrule is a copper sleeve fitted over
the end of the tube to secure a water-tight joint
between the end of the tube and the hole in the
flue-sheet their use is universal in this country
although abroad as many instances will be found
of locomotives without as with them

 would appreciate a short explanation rela-
tive to the back-set or offset of the link sad-
dle-pin as i notice that different classes of
engines have different offsets must it be a cer-
tain amount and what is the advantage so gained
-d j south tacoma washington

  it will be very difficult to give a short explana-
tion of the necessity for this condition as the mo-
tion of the link is quite complex and can be much
better illustrated through diagrams than de-
scription in brief the saddle stud is thrown out
of center of the link arc to correct the error in the
latters motion arising from the angularity of the
main or connecting-rod and is placed somewhat
back of the link arc the effect is obviously to
cause the entire link to bodily rise and fall during
its movement

the location of the saddle-stud is determined


the railroad mans magazine

by trial upon the engine itself an adjustable stud
being provided which is bolted to the link when
after repeated trials it is found to be in the best
approximate position the link is then removed
from the engine and with the adjustable stud is
taken to the link shop where the permanent stud
is made in accordance with it in the case of a
number of engines of identical dimensions the ad-
justable stud is applied to the first one only and
the following engines of that lot have their per-
manent studs made in duplicate

   the subject of locomotive link motion in gen-
eral is quite attractive and if you feel an interest
in it would suggest that you study it from the
many standard works which are devoted to its ex-
clusive consideration these may be procured
through any technical book publisher

theoretically the exact center of a

solid wheel does not move while the wheel
is revolving is it therefore possible for
any atom or particle of matter which composes
the wheel to remain still under these conditions
-h i-i p spokane washington

  the exact center of a disc is of course station-
ary but the atoms composing this stationary line
may be said to be in constant motion and con-
tinually changing places with those near by which
are in rotary motion these atoms are subject to
both centrifugal and centripedal forces molecular
considerations in connection with the rotation of
a disc forbid the assumption that any two parts of
the disc or the atoms composing it can move in
opposite directions

explain the operation of a two-cycle gas or
gasoline-engine

       	is it possible to obtain an explosion
once in every revolution and can il be obtained
without using the jump spark -w a o viro-
gua wisconsin

  	the majority of these engines are of the
crank-case compression type the piston coming
down compresses the charge in the crank case
and when at its lowest position it uncovers the
inlet port whereupon the charge being under com-
pression rushes up into the compression chamber
the piston coming up again compresses the
charge and at the right moment the spark takes
place and ignites it

  	a make-and-break spark will work equally
as well as a jump-spark we would advise you to
go to some library and look up works on gas and
gasoline engines there you will find full de-
scriptions and illustrations of the different types
of two-cycle engines

flagging a flirtation

by lillian bennet-thompson

    how norah odays romance with reginald launce-
    lot de qourcey engineer ran on an open switch

here was a thin film of dust
on the claw feet of the table
and norah on her knees was
industriously removing it as
she worked she sang there
was no particular reason why
she should not sing if
she wanted to as her
mistress was below
stairs and well out of
hearing norah
didnt much care any-
way she had prob-
ably heard worse
voices

  so the girl caroled
lustily dwelling on
the high notes in or-
der to get their full
artistic value right
in the middle of aa
alluring a-flat she
stopped abruptly
cocked her head on
one side like a bird
listened and then has-
tily scrambled to her
feet

 she had become
conscious of an oppo-
sition concert that
however lacking in
harmony was never-
theless sweeter than
the most divine music
in her ears it con-
sisted of a series of
short toots from a loco-
motive whistle as
norah poked her curly
head out of the win-
dow the locomotive

was just in sight around the curve below
the house

  as the cab came opposite the window a
long arm protruded a cap waved for a mo-
ment and norah had a fleeting glimpse of a
smiling good-natured face upturned to hers

  she fluttered her
duster in response
and watching the
long string of freight-
cars swing by strained
her eyes after the yel-
low caboose until it
whisked around the
upper curve of the cut
and out of sight

  with a happy sat-
isfied sigh she re-
turned to her dusting
and her interrupted
song

aji the summer early
and late

  and in the autumn
     drear

a maiden stood at the
garden gate
and waved at the en-
gineer

he liked to look at her
face so fair

  and her homely cotton
       dress

she liked to look at the
man up there
at the front of the fast

        express

she trilled ecstatic-
ally somewhere she
had read the words
and remembered them

the locomotive was just in sight

flagging a

the tune was all her own and she was
proud of it

  it required no great stretch of imagina-
tion to substitute a second-story window for
a garden gate nor to exalt a mixed freight
into a through express besides it was a
very pretty sentiment norah liked to fancy
herself in the role of the girl at the garden
gate although she was morally certain that
norah oday in the neat blue gown and
ruffled apron that set off her trim figure to
such advantage andthe coquettishly frilled
cap set so jauntily on her abundant auburn
hair made a much more fascinating heroine
than the individual in the cotton dress

  it was evident that the engineer of the
mixed freight thought so too judging from
the expression of his blue eyes when they
rested on her norah hoped that there 
would be no such tragic ending to her ro-
mance as had come to that of the young
lady in the poem

  a mixed freight piled in the ditch would
not be nearly so picturesque as a string of
pullmans

  for a whole month there had not been
a week-day morning when the whistle of the
freight had failed to shriek at the lower
curve the house stood just back from the
edge of a rather steep embankment at the
foot of which ran the railroad tracks the
side window of the second story offered a
coign of vantage and every morning rain
or shine norah stood there to smile and
wave her duster at the man who sat in the
engine-cab

   there were only two flies in the delicious
honey of her romance one was that she
did not know the name of the engineer the
other that lie had never stopped to speak
with her

  the first did not matter so much
whats in a name a hind-shack by any
other name would work as hard norah
had been reading a wonderful tale of an
engineer named reginald launcelot de-
courcey who had fallen in love with a
beauteous maiden of lowly estate after a
long-distance courtship carried on by means
of cleverly devised wigwagging the gentle-
man had finally carried off the blushing
damsel in the engine cab he had turned
out to be the president of the road learning
the business from the ground up and he
forthwith married the maiden and they had
lived happily ever after

  norah thought  reginald  a very pretty
name after all it was quite within the

flirtation	

possibilities diat her engineer might be
possessed of such a euphonious cognomen
so reginald he became to her and she
adorned his head with a glittering halo of
romance dreaming of the time when the
adonis of the cab should bring the panting
monster to a standstill outside die house
and call to her in accents of tender passion
to fly with him and behis bride

  to be sure he would not know by what
name to address her but that was a matter
soon remedied in the meantime my
love or my own darling would do
equally well and norah was certain that
she should not fail to respond in either case

  but as the summer wore on and reginald
was still a little backward about coming
forward norah began to feel piqued was
it possible that her hero was faint-hearted
or did he fear to test her love for him
surely by this time he should have spoken

  but he only smiled and smiled and waved
his cap-the same cap by the way-and it
was beginning to show unmistakable signs
of the wear and tear of a strenuous life
in the story the engineer-president had
waited but tyo short weeks before declaring
his love why then did reginald delay
until the time ran into montiis

  norah grew weary of watching at the
window for the train to come to a halt
speculation as to whether this or that were
the day when reginald would summon her
to his side began to pall his smile was
just as sweet his gesture as debonair but
norah longed for some more definite demon-
stration

  the instant that the wheezy whistle ap-
prised her of the approach of the train she
was at the window her eyes alight an eager
smile of anticipation on her lips-but the
light died and the smile faded as the train
rolled on

  as the summer deepened into autumn she
shook the duster hopelessly almost mechani-
cally-much in the same way that an elec-
tric bell rings when one pushes the button
the whistle touched a nerve in norahs
brain and her hand responded to the con-
tact by shaking a white cloth in the direc-
tion from which the sound came while her
eyes wistful with hope deferred followed
the waving cap until it disappeared from
view

  she felt like marianna in the moated
grange would he ever come she told
herself that her life was dreary not worth
the living without reginald and yet she


the railroad mans magazine

had given him all necessary encouragement
and if he still hesitated and hung back it
ill became her to seem too anxious

  one morning she was going about her
work with less than her usual animation
it was late in october a dull gray day with
a suggestion of a chill in the air norahs

 a tear splashed on the polished surface
 of the table and norah sadly rubbed it
 away

 just as she did so the sound of the door-
 bell pealed through the house

  ill go norah came her mistresss
 voice from down-stairs

 thought hed stop to speak to you
eh  well thats just what he did

tate of mind harmonized with the weather
she had at last come to the distressing
conclusion that reginald had been but
trifling with her his delay admitted of 
other explanation

   if he had really loved her he would have
found means to tell her so ere this true
affection would have scorned time-tables
and the yard boss she felt herself ag-
grieved slighted scorned

  it had been a sad day for norah when
-he first looked out from the second-story
side window and met the twinkling blue
eye- of the engineer of the mixed why oh
why had she ever listened to the allurements
of a whistled courtship and oh norah
decourcey was such a beautiful name

  a moment later the girl heard the voice
again

  norah norah bring my golf jacket
down its in the closet hurry

  norah dropped the duster and went to the
closet she took the jacket off the hook
started for the door-then stopped and stood
listening

  yes-there was no mistake she could
distinguish clearly the labored puff-puff of
an engine coming up the grade reginalds
train was approaching

  norah called her mistress again
what are you doing

  norah hesitated divided between duty
and devotion should she hurry down-
stairs with the jacket or stop and wave to
flagging a flirtation



reginald her mistress was waiting im-
patiently but what would he think if he
did not see her at the window hark
there was the whistle

  simultaneously the voice below screamed
norah in acid accents

  she must go but first she rushed to
the window and thrust out her head the
engine was well in sight pausing only
long enough to frantically flap the jacket
she held in her hand she withdrew her head
and sped from the room and down-stairs

  what were you about demanded her
irate mistress as she reached the lower hall
the cleaner has come for the jacket he
hasnt all day to wait take it to him-
hes at the side door

  murmuring something about not being
able to find it right off maam norah took
the garment to the waiting cleaner and
watched him stride down the path and
then-her heart almost stopped beating

  on the track almost directly below her
stood a long string of motionless freight-cars
and a man was climbing swiftly up the bank
toward the house

  reginald her hero had arrived

  she must go to meet him quickly she
ran down the steps to the edge of the cut

  whats the matter demanded the man
breathlessly as he came within hailing dis-
tance

 matter nothin what do you
mean asked norah wonderingly 

   what was the red flag for  

  in a flash norah remembered the red
jacket she had waved from die window in
her haste she had not thought of the color
and the engineer had taken it for a danger
signal reginald had not stopped for her
then he had not even come himself but
had sent the brakeman to find out what had
happened

  nothin she said again in a meek
little voice  i was just afther wavin at
reg-i mean at the engineer tis every
mornin i do it i didnt notice what color
was the coat i shook

  a grin of illuminated understanding over-
spread the face of the brakeman

  youll be the girl that waves out the
window every day then he suggested

   every day said norah proudly  tis
not one ive missed the whole summer
shure when i saw the cars there i thought
-i thought- she blushed and stam-
mered and the brakeman took up the un-
finished sentence

  thought hed stopped to speak to you
eh well thats just what he did hed
like to meet you will you step down a
minute he cant leave the engine
norah beamed all over her face

 shure id like to she said promptly
 come on then said the brakeman
 but youll have to hurry we can only
stop a minute ill help you down the
bank

  norah gave a little pat or two at her
pompadour shook out her stiffly starched
skirts and prepared to follow her cheeks
glowed her eyes sparkled her lips were
parted in a smile over her pretty teeth she
was going to meet reginald launcelot de-
courcey at last	

  a moment later she found herself stand-
ing beside the engine

  jack said the brakeman this is the
young lady-

  shure youre not him burst out no-
rah ready to cry with disappointment and
vexation for-the man who leaned from
the cab-window cap in hand was not regi-
nald he was a total stranger on whom she
had never set eyes before

  i aint who the engineer wanted to
know

   the engineer-the man - i - who -
he- words failed her

   oh you mean the regular man 

  norah nodded

  aint he on the train any more she
asked faintly

   oh yes but im takin his run to-
day my trains the one that goes up at
noon dan-hell be on again to-morrow
dan

   sure dan mulligan thats his name
might i ask what yours is miss

  norah oday faltered the girl

  norah mulligan shades of reginald
launcelot decourcey

    thats a pretty name aint it bob  
observed the engineer leaning further out
of the cab-window i say miss-

  he aint sick inquired norah hesita-
tingly

  who-dan oh no hes just got a
day off- its his crystal weddin anniver-
sary hes takin his wife an the kids out

  the kids gasped norah her knees
almost giving way

the railroad mans magazine

why dont you wave to me id be pleased
to have you

norah felt that she could hear no more
 i-im afraid ill have to go in she
stammered -i-got work to do

   all right responded the engineer cheer-
fully for the first time after that one ter-
rible instant when she had realized he was
not her own engineer norah lifted her eyes
to his face he was not a bad-looking chap
and his brown eyes were filled with honest
admiration

  im jack mcgrath he continued
look out to-morrow will you his
hand moved toward the throttle

but norah fled

  there was a thin film of dust on the
claw-foot and norah knelt to remove it
her eyes were just a trifle red and swollen
but a judicious use of powder had removed
most of the traces of the tears that had be-
dewed her-pillow the night before

of the song to-day the joyous lilt was
missing from her tones and she avoided the
high notes her romance with reginald

dan mulligan-a wife and six children

   over the river and down the track
   the train will dash to-day

   but what are the ribbons of white and black
   the engine wears away

  in wailing accents norah wanted to
know there was a sad and mournful ca-
dence in her voice as befitted the sentiment

 its his crystal weddin
anniversary

launcelot decourcey had in-
deed struck an open switch

suddenly her quick ear
caught the rumble of wheels
the quick sharp blasts of a
whistle she raised her right
hand a few inches then came
to herself with a start and
jerked it back plying the duster
energetically

for the first time in months
dan mulligans watchful eye
caught no gleam of white at the upper win-
dow he hung out of the cab as long as
the house remained in sight but no one
appeared

  a tear trickled down norahs cheek she
wiped it away and rose slowly to her feet

  jack was afther savin j was to look
out at noon she murmured to herself as
her eyes sought the clock
naming  pullmans a year

by felix g prentice

do you remember the delightful story that is recorded in the narratives
of the famous philosopher of chicago mr dooley when mr and mrs
dooley wanted to name the baby boy the father was intent on having
him christened with a couple of good hibernian appellations and mrs dooley
was equally insistent for a cognomen that was sufficiently poetic to suggest
little lord fauntleroy at a pink tea so they quarreled and in the heat of
the argument mrs dooley hotly said to her husband

     do you think i want my child named for the pay-roll of the dock depart-
ment 
an do vez think  want him n-named fer th pullman car company
said mr dooley

how young men in the office of the general manager of the pullman
company at chicago tease the alphabet to
manufacture new monikers

one having cast-off names
to dispose of may like to
know that they will be
thankfully received by the
pullman company a worthy
corporation which is having
a hard struggle to provide its large and
growing collection of sleeping - cars with
respectable cognomens

  to be perfectly frank it may be said
though at the risk of wounding a proud
corporations sensibilities that the pull-
man company is so hard up in the matter
of nomenclature that the name  pioneer
with which the first pullman car ever
built was christened has been dry-cleaned
and made over and fixed up for four gen-
erations of cars

  after forty - five years of continuous
service in the dust and grime and storm
and genera stress of railroading it is in
such a state that it cannot be sent to the
cleaners again	

  spinsters and other volunteers always
ready to name a new baby at a moments
notice may think it is no trick to name

a mere sleeping-car perhaps it would not
be if there were only a dozen or a hundred
or even two hundred of them as a mat-
ter of fact the pullman company got along
famously while the list of proper names in
the back of the dictionary held out

  but there were  pullman standard
sleeping parlor observation and private
cars in service on october   and
new ones are being turned out at the rate
of four for each working day that is
 a week  a month and  a year
each and every one of these cars is re-
quired to have a name for its exclusive use

  if there is anybody who considers it a
simple task to think of twenty-four new
names every week in the year after 
possible combinations of vowels and con-
sonants have been eliminated from the eli-
gible list just let him try let him bear
in mind that according to the rules laid
down by the pullman company it is neces-
sary to select names that mean something
that are euphonious and that do not have
too many letters

  by ay of illustrating the application
c

the railroad mans magazine

  of the rules suppose we select at random
  a few names from among the  pullman
  cars on the northern pacific

    in the name skagit we have an ex-
  cellent exemplification of euphony tush-
  epah  clearly means something if we only
  knew what it was while nisqually is a
  model of brevity

some northern pacific names

    if the point is not yet clear it may be
  added that all the virtues to be desired in
  an ideal name are to be found in  ole-
  qua  moclips  sokulk palikee
  nemadji  castah atsina  che-
  wah  sharha  skillute  stillasha
   wiuewahpalouse nehalem wy-
  noocha youcone yarnpah um-
  pyna kittitas kooskia lezeka
  opeechee minta and nushka

    twelve hundred and forty - eight new
  names a year is it any wonder that
  while all the rest of the world is more or
  less gay the young men in the general
  managers office at chicago which is sad-
  dled with a sort of blanket responsibility
   for the production of names when required
  appear distrait and jump convulsively
  when a care-free acquaintance from some
  other department gives them an unexpected
  slap between the shoulders

    unfortunately there is no hope for re-
  lief instead of being satisfied to let well
  enough alone the pullman company em-
  ploys a staff of designers to twist things
  around in sleeping-cars in order to meet
  the designers plans the company has to
  build more cars accordingly this not
  only makes a lot of extra work around the
  shops but it adds to the burden of wo in
  the general managers office to express in
  iambic tetrameter the troubles of the un-
  fortunates who have to provide names for
  the new cars

     while workmen skilled so swiftly build

       the scrumptious cars that rouse our wonder

     they sigh and swear ajid tear their hair

      and darn the luck to thunder

    fortunately the names do not have to
  be forthcoming when the cars are ordered
  built a lot number serves the purpose
  during construction but in the general
  managers office it is realized only too well
  that each day brings forth its quota of cars

  there are but twenty-six letters in the
  alphabet and the possible combinations are

so hampered by the requirements of eu-
phony brevity and significance that un-
charitable things should not be said of the
sponsors if in their agony the- should
bring forth such names as  coyeta
ilus reita curraliee  juana-
luska berhera  olytes  ophytes
 rahula zeyla  viento bisuka
lylete napata navarete azusa
garita  atoyac  contento  es-
pira  istlan liorna eylau mo-
corito parrao tenescal tavares
 altata

  unforeseen contingencies growing out of
car names sometimes lead to tragedies to
mention a single example a young wife
on her way to st louis a couple of years
ago gave birth to a child on a big four
train there was a physician on board as
there generally is and the pullman con-
ductor and porter made her comfortable in
a drawing-room altogether the mother
was so pleased that she decided to name
her boy for the car in which he was born

  but alas little did she realize what a
pullman car name can be when it really
tries imagine her horror when she found
that her beloved son would have to struggle
through this vale of tears handicapped by
the name  skalkaho

  think of it skalkaho finnegan

  if he should turn out to be a russian
dancer he may pull through-but suppose
he should be a politician what would
the boys in the gas-house district not do
to skalkaho finnegan

helping the name-finders

  sometimes a neighborly railroad sends
in a mess of names that keeps the pullman
company going for a day or two this is
most likely to happen when the railroad is
putting on a new train or when it wants
fresh equipment for an old one railroads
in such cases frequently ask the pullman
company to name the sleepers and parlor-
cars after cities along the route or at least
to provide names suggestive of the locality
through which the train runs

  thus some of the pullmans on the new
york centrals twentieth century lim-
ited are named  briarcliff  rhinecliff
kaaterskill knickerbocker etc to
the empire state express on the sarpe road
are assigned the empire state buf-
falo little falls fort plain west
point and so on
naming  pullmans a year



  a few years ago a general passenger
agent inspired by his marriage with senti-
ments of philanthropy told the pullman
company that it might use the names of
his bride and sister-in-law the pullman
company thankfully christened the next
two cars geraldine and maybelle
following out the idea of providing cars
with names suggestive  of the country
through which they run the eight pull-
mans assigned to the mexican interoceanic
railway are the jalapa malintzi
 xochitl  espanola  la heroica
mexicano anahuac and urua-
pan while the four on the narrow-gage
mexican national are the acamtaro
patzcuaro el moro and manitou
on certain trains on the pennsylvania
the pullman parlor-cars run to hs as
 hartley  herminie  highspire
holly beach  honeybrook  hope-
well and howard

even the saints

  for a short time the sad-eyed young men
in the general managers office were happy
when one of them chanced to run across
the calendar of saints they had almost
become reconciled to life by the time they
had bestowed the names of sixty saints on
sleeping-cars including st servan st
carvan  st arsene and  st gretna
then an unmerciful official asked if the
pullman company was an ecclesiastical
enterprise or an early spanish explorer
and anyway would they kifidly give the
saints a rest

  then they turned to classical names but
demigods with a past were not deemed eli-
gible to circulate in the exclusive society of
limited trains and the list was cut down
almost to the vanishing point they wan-
dered through lippincotts gazetteer and
the biographical dictionary commandeered
an  ambassador a  diplomate and a
consul  from the diplomatic service and
in their desperation even descended to con-
gress long enough to christen the  senator

  when all these resources failed there was
nothing to do but to fall back on ortho-
graphic delirium tremens again with
heroic fortitude these nameless sponsors for
their identity is hidden behind a veil of
mystery as impenetrable as a pullman cur-
tain started in at a and waded reso-
lutely through the alphabet

  just to emphasize the assertion that they

are not overlooking any bets they have
evolved no fewer than seventy-seven names
beginning with  ch as  chusca  cha-
ro  chowan  chickies  chico and
so on

some prolific letters

  altogether the letter  c  has proved
the most prolific in the alphabet having
yielded no fewer than  names a
did pretty well with an output of 
names even so unpromising a letter as
z produced  names including  zam-
ba zara and zelda ydid bet-
ter with  names like yolande yo-
landa yentoi u did pretty well
with ulseah umpvna and  others
but q was hard sledding for it only
yielded  names

  it is really wonderful to see what the
name-builders can do with unpromising
material give them an ancient name that
doesnt seem to have life enough to stand
tacking on a single car and they will nurse
it along amputating a vowel here and
grafting a syllable there until they have
fairly outdone the miracle of the loaves
and fishes

  take a simple little name like ruth
that does nicely for one car but you
wouldnt think they could irrigate and fer-
tilize those four simple little letters until
they produced  ruthella  rutherford
and ruthven would you well they
did just the same

  in the same way  york after having
some yeast stirred in and being set by the
kitchen stove swelled to  yorklyn
yorkshire yorktown and york
haven rhoda yielded rhodes
 rhodesia and  rhode island and
 india  was worked up into  indiana
 indianola and  indianapolis

   one of the favorite railroad classics re-
lates how george m pullman used to pay
his daughter florence  a year to
name cars for him as the idealization of
the soft snap for which we spend our lives
hunting this story struck a universal heart
chord in short it never failed to make a
hit moreover it would have been just like
pullman if he had been that sort of man
but not being that kind of man he never
did anything of the sort

  the story grew out of a chicago space-
writers need of three dollars

the question of names seems to have


the railroad mans magazine

haunted pullman throughout his life even
the town of pullman was not named without
difficult- it seems that the architect em-
ployed to lay out this model town which has
been written about more than any other town
of the same size in america was w w be-
man he became so enthusiastic as the
beautiful plans grew under his hand that
he was filled with a desire to immortalize
his name by bestowing it on the model town

naming a model town

  when a favorable opportunity presented
itself he mentioned his modest ambition to
pullman that famous car-builder turned
the request over in his mind a moment then
said

   well the fact is mr beman i had
rather thought of naming the town for my-
self

  noticing a cloud of disappointment spread
over the architects face he hastened to add
but ill tell you what we can do we can
compromise the matter suppose we make
up a name by taking the first syllable of my
name and the last syllable of yours then
we will both be happy

  apparently there is no way to avoid the
necessity of providing palace cars with
names in the first place the railroad com-
panies cannot furnish the service provided
by tbe pullman company one strong ap-
peal that the pullman car makes is that it
goes where the passenger wants to go re-
gardless of the number of roads it has to
pass over to get there

  it might perhaps be feasible for the
railroads constituting a through line to agree
on some plan for providing equipment for
ordinary service but no railroad is willing
to tie up money needed to furnish the extra
equipment to meet emergencies that alto-
gether amount to half a dozen days a year

  just to show the extent of these emer-
gencies take the case of the new york
central which required  extra pullmans
to bring home returning new yorkers the
day after labor day the cars were on the
spot when wanted when it is remembered
that but  pullmans are assigned to all

the busy roads in die district of which new
york is the headquarters it will be seen
that emergency demands are pretty heavy

   it is a safe guess that no railroad would
be willing to tie up  in  extra
sleeping-cars to be used but once a year
neither would they be willing to provide the
extra equipment to make up the five bankers
specials that crossed the continent early last
fall

  but the pullman company can do all
these things because there are emergency
calls from somewhere in this big land pretty
nearly all the time though it is seldom that
more than one hurry call comes in at a time

   this enables one central organization to
keep its reserve equipment in pretty steady
service this makes for economy by a
wise manipulation of the reserve equipment
all the fluctuating demands of traffic are met
with a minimum deadhead mileage but it
takes a lot of work

   one man at the new york headquarters
spends his working hours before a board full
of holes that fills one side of a room and
overflows on to another sticking wooden
pegs into the holes and taking them out
again

   each peg represents a pullman car and
the board shows the manager at a glance
just where each car is and where he can
look for reserves to meet a demand from any
point in his large territory another man is
fully occupied in keeping tab on joy-riders
in private cars scattered all over the north
american continent

   pullmans must continue to bear names be-
cause the railroad companies number dieir
coaches hauled on the same trains with
them if the pullmans used numbers too
the inevitable result would be confusion in
handling trains so there is nothing to do
but grind out names yet there is a mathe-
matical limit to what can be done with
twenty-six letters every day that passes
brings the crisis nearer

   if congress could spare a few moments
from its full-crew bills locomotive-inspec-
tion bills and unlimited-baggage bills per-
haps it might be induced to place imported
car names on the free list

by tom jackson

not all the interesting stories under this heading deal with railroad men
themselves but tom jackson who is an old-time tallow-pot has gathered
yarns from many sources and as they are all interesting we are glad to
give them space and if you will ask tom jackson he will tell you that his
railroad days were the happiest of his life each story that follows contains
something that will interest if when you have read them all you do not see
the railroad man from several new viewpoints then we have missed our guess

the washout sign-asleep in the cabin-for a mail contract-cool heads
in danger -the wonderful watch-our mother
tongue-spotting the married ones

then the wildest country in south central
texas

  one stretch of eight miles ran through
the famous wharton bottom a forest of
oak and elm with an undergrowth of haw
and wild brier

  the bottoms were said to be the abound-
ing place of escaped convicts bear and deer
andy will bear me witness that in those
early days of the cane belt the bottom cer-
tainly was the ranging grounds of a certain
mule the mule having caused andy to put
her over and give her all there was one
foggy morning in 

  we were south-bound local freight no 
with engine  pulling us - andy mccas-
land a young tallow-pot just from the katy


mccaslands washout signs

        ndy mccasland will verify
the truth of the statement
that a man on the right side
of an engine will stop when
any object is violently waved
across the track that is
an old rule in railroading which has al-
ways been strictly adhered to by every em-
ployee and one that has doubtless saved
many lives

  andy was an engineer on the old cane
belt road a property long since absorbed
by the gulf colorado and santa fe which
runs from sealy to matagorda texas a
distance of ninety miles through what was


the railroad mans magazine

was at the throttle and herman ze was
handling the scoop i was braking ahead
and as a matter of course while the train
was in motion i was in the head mans
accustomed place on the seat box behind
herman getting my brief bit of  spot

  we had been on the road all day and all
night and were all but dead from loss of
sleep and we were overworked from un-
loading bacon and corn-meal at the stations
between the two terminals

  being thus  batty-eyed no doubt ac-
counted for andys optical illusion and
when he saw an object coming down the
track right in the edge of the woods waving
a stop sign he concluded that something had
gone wrong with the track

  he reached up and got the whistle-cord
tooted twice in answer to the  washout
and dien gave his air about ten pounds
reduction

  the fireman looked ahead and saw what
he imagined to be a high-ball coming from
the same source but andy was too busy
stopping to notice a high-ball and finally
brought the train to a full stop

  then he looked up sure enough some-
thing or somebody was giving him an old-
fashioned high-ball

  andy started his train again and by this
time the  tallow  had awakened me i
looked ahead at his request and saw the
object it was giving another washout
stop-sign following up with a high-ball

  andy was tooting like mad and mad as
a hornet he was for by all that is uncanny
the signal-maker proved to be a lop-eared
mule which had come out of the bottoms
to avoid the mosquitoes and had stepped on
the track

  he was busy switching the pests off with
hi- tail and at even motion he would give
either a stop-signal or a high-ball it was
so nearly like the real thing that andy
mccasiand put the old s in the big hole
and stopped dead fully believing that some
track-walker had signaled

asleep in the cabin

qjpeaking of wharton bottom reminds
me of another incident which occurred
on the same line it happened in september
 during the heavy rush of business on
the cane belt when the cotton season was
on and the rice rush-then in its infancy
in texas-was jost looking up

  that fall was a wet one even for south
texas and as the track was new and poorly
ballasted it was almost impossible to move
faster than six miles an hour through whar-
ton bottom which before the coming of the
railway was a dismal swamp

  that part of it through which the road
runs is somewhat higher than the rest and
the dump built of mud from the barrow
pils acts as a dam for the lake on either
side

  we were going north on no  one rainy
night and as the engineer had loved ones
at home awaiting him he was doing his best-
to make as fast time as possible

  when about the middle of the woods the
old three got it into her head to act nutty
she put her two fore-feet on the ties and
ran in that manner for several hundred
yards before the hogger could stop her

  four blasts of the whistle had the con-
ductor luke dial and two brakemen come
to the front and the work of replacing the
mill was begun

  we worked for two solid hours back and
forth and round about carrying heavy frogs
and ties until we were almost exhausted
finally we got the engine back on the rails
and started on our way happy in the thought
that we would soon be out of the bottom
and on good track again

  we were soon to be sadly disappointed
however we had not gone half a mile be-
fore we were all huddled in a corner of the
caboose with the stove and the water-cooler
on top of us and with smoke and brimstone
rising from the floor of the caboose where
-the captain had gone down

  we extricated ourselves from the links
pins air-horse and other objects and went
ahead to ascertain the cause of the sudden
stop

  what we saw made us sick three fur-
niture cars crosswise of the track and on
each side a lake of water three-feet deep
and no dry sand in sight

   to add to the pleasures of the afternoon
a cold misty rain was falling there was
nothing to do but make an effort to get the
cars back and we worked like demons for
five iiours finally succeeding in getting
every car on the rails

  we were standing beside the cars con-
gratulating ourselves on being tip-top
wreckers when something else happened
that made us all declare that as soon as
we arrived at the division we would tendec
our resignations
heard around the water-tank



  as soon as we got the cars on the track
we had the engine back down to the scene
of the derailment in order that we might
more conveniently load the frogs onto the
tender

  while this was happening the rails which
had been loosened by the derailed cars
turned under the engine letting her down
into the mud and making it impossible for
us to budge a wheel

  there was nothing for the crew to do but
return to the caboose and go to bed this
we did although it began to look as if the
rear man would have to go back a distance
of twenty telegraph poles and protect our
train

  the hind man refused to do anything of
the kind putting up as an excuse that there
was not an engine on the south end and it
was impossible for a train to hit us

  we were working under standard rules
however and something had to be done so
we compromised on the negro cook joe who
lived in our dog-house joe agreed to
go back to bear junction a mile away
where there was a cabin erected by wood-
choppers and do the flagging

  next morning we sent back for joe and
found him asleep in the cabin

a race for mail contract

t ack in the early eighties considerable
 rivalry existed between two great
trunk lines the louisville and nashville
and the queen and crescent for the mail
contract between cincinnati and new or-
leans word had been received from the
post office department in washington that
the mail contract was to be awarded to the
road making the best time over these two
lines on a certain day word was sent
down the line of the queen and crescent
that the big race was to be pulled off the
next day

  first no  consisting of a mail-car bag-
gage-car two dav-coaches and a pullman
would leave cincinnati at  in the morn-
ing would have the right of way over all
trains and would be given a clear track-
the white board by day and the white light
by night

  as a precaution track-walkers acting un-
der orders of the division road-masters had
personally inspected all switches and road-
bed culverts and looked for any bolts or
taps that might be loose section-men with

white flags by day and white lights by night
were stationed along the line to give the
proper signals that all was right in fact
every precaution was taken to assist in the
fast run being made without accident

   promptly on the second no  rolled into
the car shed in chattanooga there the
cincinnati southern men surrendered the
train to the alabama great southern crew
who were to make the record-breaking run
to meridian mississippi a distance of 
miles

  the train was in charge of captain mar-
tin ford conductor jesse haver as cool-
headed and fearless a man as ever pulled a
throttle was in the cab his engine was
one of two large mcqueens that had been
sent down from the shops in ludow ken-
tucky for the occasion these were con-
sidered the fastest passenger-engines in the
service of those days

  only a few moments were consumed in
transferring train equipments in chatta-
nooga and we were off the cincinnati
southern having made a record-breaking
run from cincinnati we were eager to hold
up the good start over the alabama great
southern division

   by the time the red lights on the rear end
of the pullman passed out of the lower end
of the car-shed we were hitting a twenty-
mile clip with sand running from the
dome-pipe and the big drivers catching
good  toe hold  on the rails with every
revolution

   out in the darkness like a thing of life
the great curls of black smoke boiling from
the mcqueens smoke-stack rushed the
train-the smooth rails under the glare of
the headlight looking like ribbons of silver

  the white lights flashed as she sped
through the yards past cravens where the
white light shining like a star was flaghed
then around the bend of the blue tennessee
hugging the great gray walls of old look-
out now and then the big brass bell clang-
ing with the swaying of the engine as she
gathered momentum

  down through the little hamlet of wan-
hatchie where the switch had been turned
onto the alabama great southern main line
to save stopping then down the long straight
stretch through wildwood

  then it was she sprang forward like some
frightened bird darting out into the black
night the engineer dropping her down a
couple of notches and tapping the throttle-
lever the big engine responded nobly

cool heads in danger mo-
ments

this incideit happened eighteen months
ago on what is known as the d and
r g and c and s joint track between the
junctions of walsenburg and cuchara in
colorado

  i have witnessed many deeds of daring
many acts of charity and many daxe-t
devil stunts performed by railroad men
but i never before saw such a quick-witted
cool-headed stunt as the following after
it was all over i told the conductor and
all the satisfaction that i got from him was

    well you have certainly got to have your
head cut in all the time down on this joint-
track if you want to get over the road

   it was a rio grande passenger-train that
left denver about  pm heavily laden
with passengers for the san juan and its
tributaries this train had reached cu-
chara junction on time and pulled out at
about  am

  the wind was blowing nearly a hurri-
cane and the mercury was down below the
freezing point

   the blackness of the night did not help
to make it very pleasant for engineer wal-
ter henthorn the snow beating against die
window in his cab kept him with his head
continually out searching the inky blackness
for danger

   it is a busy piece of track between wal-
senburg and pueblo and the two big rail-
roads handle many trains there in twenty-
four hours

  henthorn had just whistled for walsen-
burg junction when out ahead on the main
line he caught sight of the three red lights
of a freight-train bearing down upon him

  on the rear end stood a man giving him
frantic signals with a red lantern to back up

  he started his train back toward cu-
chara tii inking that a freight-train was
backing down to head in and let him pass
but as the signals became more rapid and
the train got nearer he came to the conclu-
sion that it was a runaway coal-train

   to back his train east without a flag to
protect was an awful risk as no  never
left cuchara without at least two or three
west-bound freights following

   at this time the entire force of machinists
on the system were striking and many en-
gines were compelled to run without head-
lights

   it was a trying position it seemed to
be one thing or the other to stop and lie
crushed to death by the approaching train
or hurl the train with its hundred or more
sleeping passengers to certain disaster

  a cool head appeared in the person of
conductor george stout he had taken in
the situation at a glance suddenly the
rear end of the passenger-train was a blaze
heard around the water-tank



of red lights as fast as one fuzee burned
out another took its place

  their speed had to be increased in order
to outdistance the fast-approaching outlaw
and their little engine was throwing sky-
rockets into the air and streaks of lire from
the slipping drivers

  a train length ahead of the oncoming
caboose was the best they could do the
conductor after getting the rear-end decora-
ted and a flagman at his post came through
the train and turned out even gas-jet but
to every questioner who asked why jokingly
answered just saving a little gas know-
ing full well what the consequences would
be had he showed the least excitement

  the passengers might become panic-
stricken and jump to their death in the
darkness

  stout believed that if they beat the
runaway to cuchara they could throw it
into a siding the possibilities were that
all the tracks were full of trains but they
had to take a chance it was now simply a
case of the less killed the better

  the flagman was to jump from the rear
end of the train and throw the siding-switch
after his train was into clear

   if he fell and failed the conductor sta-
tioned at the head of the sleeper would
make the attempt

  fortunately the flagman made the switch
and shot the runaway down a clear siding
it was a caboose without a hand-brake
conductor mccoy of the freight had ridden
that flying demon down those steep six
miles absolutely helpless to control its speed
but able to warn the passenger-train

   he is one of the heroes of which the rail-
road men are justly proud

  the caboose ran through the siding and
stopped just in front of an extra pulling
into cuchara conductor stout had rushed
to the telegraph office and asked the opera-
tor at apache the first station east to hold
all trains west-but the extra had got out

  no one was killed or even injured and
thousands of dollars worth of property was
saved by a little nerve and some good judg-
ment on the part of a little band of rail-
road men

 the wonderful watch

ailroad men are inclined to- look
on the locomotive as the greatest
piece of machinerytn the world said a
jeweler as he adjusted an engineers time-

   	rr

piece  but they are mistaken every
railroad man carries the greatest piece of
machinery ever constructed right in his own
pocket-his watch

   the locomotive must run on a compara-
tively level track a grade of one foot in ten
is too much for the average engine to climb
although some few can do a bit better than
this but a watch rims upside down or in
any possible position it is the most com-
pact the strongest and the most delicate
piece of machinery ever put together by
human hands

   i know of nothing to compare it with
except possibly two things-the modern
high-power automatic rifle and the human
eye both of these are compact strong and
delicate but of the three i think the watch
leads

  the average watch has about  parts
iron gold silver copper and nickel are
used in its construction then there are the
jewels each of which must be cut more ac-
curately than the average diamond for a
ring

   it takes about  different operations
to make a watch

   but these numbers are almost nothing
when we stop to think what a watch does
to begin with it strikes  blows
against the fork every twenty-four hours
there are about  steps to the mile as
the average man walks and if he took a
step every time his watch touched the fork
he would travel  miles in a day or at
the rate of ten miles an hour

   this means  impacts a year
and this run is made without a single stop
for rest the watch does not go into the
shops every now and then as even the best
engines must nor is it oiled and readjusted
for its next run suppose we treated a loco-
motive as we do a watch it would mean
that an engine would run at least a year
and ofter four or five years never stopping
night or day

   i doubt if the average engine could
stand it for one week to say nothing about
one year usually we do oil our watches
about once a year sometimes only once in
every two years think of a locomotive
going two years without oil

   even when we figure it out on a mile-
age basis the watch has the best of it the
balance wheel moves  - of an inch
each time a total of nearly  miles a
year as watches are usually taken care of
this means about  miles on one oiling


the railroad mans magazine

  now the average watch uses aboutas
much power as four fleas would develop
it is estimated that one horse-power will
run  watches in other words
the watch as an engine on one oiling will
run over  miles on - of
one horse-power constantly applied where
is there a locomotive that can even come in
sight of such a record

   a man often drops his watch picks it
up puts it to his ear and if it is going
all right which is usually the case he
thinks no more about it and the watch keeps
right on with its work drop a locomotive
the same distance-say only five feet straight
down-and it is the shops for that engine

  there are many scientific instruments
far more delicate than a watch and many
machines far stronger but for strength and
delicacy combined nothing equals a watch

 our mother tongue

there is something in the railroad busi-
ness that gets into the fibers of a man
it becomes part of his life tinctures his
thoughts sways his moods gives a distinc-
tive air to his looks and shapes his speech

  especially is this so in the case of the
men of the western roas where there isnt
much to interfere with the development of
the individuality that arises from constant
contact with the right-of-way

  an old eagle eve never referred to his
cap but always to his  dome casing
had he occasion to hunt for his coat he won-
dered where the jacket was side-tracked
his legs he called his drivers his
hands were pins his arms side-rods
his stomach the  fire-box and his mouth
the pop

  another of his kind would speak of a
missing suspender button as a  shy spring-
hanger if a man hurt his foot and walked
with a limp he had a  flat wheel when
eating he was  firing up when drinking
he took water and if he had indulged
too much he had oiled round

  john a hill who knows railroad men
to the core tells of an engineer on the pa-
cific coast who once expressed himself as
follows in the course of a conversation
say guess who i met on the up-trip
dick taggart sure i was sailin along
up the main line near bob- and who should
i see but dick backed in oi the siding look-
ing dilapidated like he was running on

one side i just slammed on the wind and
went over and shook dick looked pretty
tough he must have been out surfacing
track he was oiled a good deal jacket
rusted and streaked tire double flanged
valves blowing packing down didnt seem
to steam right he must go to the back
shop before the old man will ever let him
in the roundhouse

   i set his packing out and put him in a
stall in grays corral dicks mighty good
working scrap if you can only get him
down to carrying water right if hed come
down to three gages hed be a dandy but
this trying to run first section with a flut-
ter in his stack all the time is no good-he
must be flagged in

  a chicago switchman when asked if it
were true that he intended to marry said
 i wouldnt care to double-crew my train
ive been raised to run my own engine and
take care of it when you clouble-pack
there is always a row as to who ought to go
ahead and enjoy the scenery or stay behind
and eat cinders

  an engineer was overheard lecturing hi
fireman thus

  well jim im ashamed of you you
come into general headquarters with your
tank afloat so full that you cant whistle
with your air-pump a squealin and the
hull of you misbehavin scandalous you
was smeared from stack to man-hole head-
light smoked and glimmer dont know
your rights kind of runnin wild-cat with-
out proper signals imagining you are firsr
section with a regardless order what you
want to do is to blow out trim up get your
packing set out and carry less juice

   youre worse than the slipping dan-
cing three-legged freight haulers that the
new super has sprung on us the next
time i catch you at high gage ill scrap

   oil around if you must but put the
air on steady bring her down to a proper
gait throw her into full release so as to
stop right drop a little oil on the worst
points ring your bell and go ahead

  this is how an old railroad man de-
scribed the wedding of his adopted daugh-
ter

   ive been up to see a new compound
start out-prettiest sight i ever saw maybe
im a bit dubious about repairs and general
running but i guess theyll make out all
right

  that little girl of mine was the trim-
mest neatest slickest little mill you ever
heard around the water-tank	

saw she was painted red and white and
gold-leaf three brass bands on her stack
solid nickel trimmings all the latest im-
provements-jest made on purpose for
specials and pay-car she got coupled to
a long fire-boxed ten-wheeler with a big
lap yes sir that babe of mine is a heart-
breaker on dress parade and the ten-wheeler
is a mogul for business

on the honeymoon special

hen the matrimonial market is
buoyant said an old con it is
interesting to notice the newlyweds starting
on their first journey

   of course it is not on account of being
ashamed of each other that they try to dis-
guise the situation but simply to avoid be-
ing criticized by inquisitive strangers
they lay the fond unction to their souls that
they are traveling incog but how badly
fooled they are

   it is one of the easiest things in the
world to the careful eye to tell precisely
how many days or even hours they have
been spliced they can sometimes be de-
tected by the great pains they take to ap-
pear like old married people or cousins as
they sit demurely in the cars in many
cases their dress exposes them-it is so
terribly in tune with the occasion being
neat symmetrical and new in cases
where the parties have good taste there is no
gaudiness or flitb-dubbing about their attire

   sometimes the youthful culprits en-

gage in playing at lovers or affect a flirta-
tion but it is always a stupendous failure
their eyes betray too much happiness for
such a disguise there is such a peculiar
softness and tenderness in their confidential
whispers and such a pride in the possession
of each other that none around them are
deceived

   it is generally the case that the bride-
groom makes the discover first and throws
his arm carelessly around the shoulders of
his wife as much as to say defiantly to the
envious whos afraid who knows but
we have been married many years 

   the guilty slyness in the way that arm
steals round first on the seat-back then
gradually closer while the bride evinces
a silent blush as she acquiesces in an un-
perceiving way indeed it is she who gen-
erally lets the cat out of the bag

   the narrow-gage seats are preferable to
the broad-gage and if you sit on the seat
back of a couple you will observe at first
the lady s shoulders are not even-they in-
cline just a little to her partner after trav-
eling in this position a few hours her neck
gets as limber as a washed paper-collar and
her head gravitates to the broad shoulders
of her husband and there it nestles inno-
cently and confidingly in the repose of hon-
est and truthful love at times in spite of
all precaution one or two of her golden locks
will get loose and drop on his shoulder

   so they go fancying themselves lost in
the crowd - unnoticed unknown - with
their secret locked up on their own palpita-
ting bosoms poor newlyweds 

new tunnel-boring machine

anew form of tunnel-boring machine has
lately been devised by mr ebbley formerly
master mechanic of the old dominion copper
mine at globe arizona the inventor says his
device will average twenty-five to fifty feet a day
no blasting is required and this eliminates one of
the dangers and a large part of the cost

  no gases collect to hinder progress of the work
three men on a shift can operate the machine

  the machine drills a circular hole from eight lo
twenty-five feet in diameter it is intended to go
through any ground that a machine drill will work
in the track is laid and the timbers placed as
the machine proceeds from one hundred and
fifty to two hundred horse-power is required to
operate the borer but the cost of this is offset by
the saving in men powder and time

  a large hollow shaft is mounted on a carrying

frame running on wheels on the track at the
head of the shaft are radial arms carrying different
drilling machines of special design for cutting
channels in the rock

  there are three complements of drills the outer
set cutting the channel that determines the size of
the bore another set cuts a channel in the rock
or earth a foot or two inside the line of the outer
channel a third set cuts a still smaller ring in
the rock and other sets may be used hammers
pound against the rock with smashing force as the
channels are cut thus breaking out the rock and
earth and allowing it to fall to the floor of the tun-
nel a shovel that has a reciprocating motion
with accelerated speed to the rear gatheis up the
muck and throws it behind the machine the
shovel is handled by an air-cylinder equipped with
a specially designed valve-gear-exchange
smiths last game

by sumnbr lucas

            it doesnt pay to be a practical joker
            and a poker fiend all at once

	you please sah de lady in de

i i next car says as how she
i wants to see yu sah if youre
i her husband sah am you
listali smith sah

                tell her in just a minute
porter-in just a minute
murmured smith as he sort-
ed out four spades tossed
a tray of clubs into the dis-
card and prayed silently
but hard for another spade

this was the third message
exchanged within an hour
in almost exactly the same
words between  de lady in
de next car and smith
yet smith still sat in the
game-a quiet little game
of poker in the drawing-
room of the denver pull-
man on the east-bound flier
running out of green
river wyoming

   ziggitty the big fat col-
ored porter of  de next
car scratched his wool
with an anxious air and
for the third time departed
to face a square - jawed
woman who abused him
for the shortcomings of her
poker-loving husband

  the idea he has
played all day and now it
is getting supper-time and
ive been alone all day and
the man said  second call
for dinner in the dining-
car  fully half an hour ago

very well ill go eat
alone which the irate
woman did a sandwich
was all smith wanted

  ugh was all he had to say to the
information that he must seek the diner
at once or get nothing to eat that night
what is a diner and a table-cloth lecture
on the evils of gambling and wife deser-
tion compared to four eights with a blue
jackpot just about ready to
be hauled in

   smith stayed in the game
the four players were
old chums many a good
time had they known to-
gether and many was the
joke they had played  some-
times on each other but
more often on some suffer-
ing outsider the year be-
fore when the four had
been together for a trip
across the country smith
had left the train and
bought a pair of clippers
when his chums were sound
asleep he had nicely clipped
great bald patches on their
heads and then flung the
clippers and the hair out
the window no one being
the wiser

  next morning in the
dressing-room there was
considerable swearing much
to smiths innocent sur-
prise the rest of the car
had roared even the dining-
car waiters had shown a
suspicious amount of dental
ivory that morning but
smith could not account for
the sudden change in the
appearance of his friends
when they noticed that
smith had a full head of
hair they were suspicious


smiths last game



and when they accused him of fleecing them
lie looked hurt and talked much about the
weakness of personal friendship even under
the strain of a few hairs

  during the next year the three whose
hair had been clipped received all manner
of advertisements for falling hair they
bore it all in good part and now the four
were together again for the first time since
that memorable occasion

  no money was in sight that being
against railroad rules yet there was plenty
of white red and blue chips on the table
and gentlemens agreement the chips rep-
resented good hard money when the game
was over

  if you please boss de lady in de next
car she says sah-

  all right - all right tell her im
coming in just a minute soon as we play
out this hand and smith shuffled the deck
for a new deal he was considerably
ahead of the game and did not want to
quit a heavy winner it wouldnt look
just right especially as he had been be-
hind for some time

  tell you what you do smith old boy
suggested big raw-boned anderson weve
been hitting it up pretty lively all eve-
ning suppose we just suspend operations
for a couple of hours take a rest and be-
gin again about midnight - its too hot to
sleep in those padded boxes to-night and
we might as well play all night as suffer
in a berth

   suppose you go back as ziggitty says
and go to bed like a good little boy will
give you a chance to get your clothes off
anyway then when the good wife is
asleep you get up on the q t and sneak
in here your pajamas wont be noticed
that time of night and well go on with the
game what you say

  lets see said smith looking at his
watch ten-ten where do we change
time green river isnt it all right
boys ill be back soon-trust me cards
and matrimony dont mix well but as i
have cards only once in a while and mat-
rimony all the while ill be back soon as
i can escape ziggitty 

  yes sah

 what time do we get into omaha  
two-fifteen to-morrow afternoon sah
well good-by boys see you later
whew its hot pray for me boys i now
go to my doom and smith after cashing
his chips left for the rear pullman

  to his surprise mrs smith hadnt a
word to say she was in the lower berth
and pretended to be very drowsy as smith
climbed into the upper then the train
settled down for the night  and the air
grew cooler as sherman hill was passed

  smith dosed off a bit then awoke with
a sense of having slept for hours he
cautiously looked at his watch

   midnight and half an hour over the
boys will think im not square with them
not to give them a chance to play even
smith slid carefully out of the upper
and after a breathless second to see if the
wakeful mrs smith had discovered his
flight-clad in his pajamas-he slipped
along the swaying car and into the sleeper
head

  quitter play your friends for the
cash and then run cold feet greeted
smith as he sat into the game

   boys we have till two oclock you
are in the denver sleeper and im bound
for chicago we divide at cheyenne at
two oclock the game ends at one forty-
five get busy and win it back if you
can

  in half an hour smith said

  wonder what we are stopping for
backing up too-

  youre shy smith chip in your
deal pete time enough to worry later
its only one oclock and we dont hit
cheyenne till two an hour from now
play up dont try to string the game out
smith old boy so you can hold on to your
winnings deal em out

  the game went on - so did the train
everything was running smoothly till
smith looked at andersons watch

  holy smoke just time for one more
round twenty minutes to two deal em
out lively now

  smiths luck had changed and he was
thirty - five dollars behind anderson
glanced at his watch and dealt the cards
smith bore a pained expression as he drew
two more cards after which his face be-
came as expressive as a piece of putty
the other two dropped out leaving an-
derson and smith to fight it out alone
anderson had drawn two cards also

  its the last hand said smith as he
shoved all his chips into the middle of the
table  if i lose im out-clean buncoed
by you cutthroats if i win im out ten
dollars you get me going and coming
wish we had longer id skin you chaps


the railroad mans magazine

never saw the poor fellow before

alive and leave you without a thread to
your backs youre not game-

  well now smithy old boy seeing
as how you are talking about being short
either way the cat jumps and being game
and all that and especially about betting
the clothes on your back ill just shove
all the chips in my pile into the pot
against that suit of pajamas of yours

  done said smith

  only two hands out each a two-card
draw and smith held four aces he could
quit honorably under the circumstances as
the dividing of the train made that neces-
sary and be a heavy winner in the bar-
gain just bv calling that idiotic bluff of
andersons about betting the last rag on
his back

  then came the show-down  give em
to me gloated smith as lie reached for
the pile after throwing down his four sin-
gle spots

  not so fast smithy not so fast ever
hear of a straight a real nice queenly
flush you know it takes the chips and
the pajamas-but you can keep the paja-
mas old man good night smithy

  the three made a break for the door
while smith danced up and down in sud-
den rage

   say you horse thieves - you send
ziggitty here right away say porter
porter 

  but no ziggitty came

  instead a scowling yellow face was thrust
through the drawing-room door and a sleep-
surly voice said

  you got to quit dat racket sah no
such noise am lowed in a pullman at dis
time of night sah

  say porter heres a dollar-smiths
hand slid down his pajamas but he found
neither pocket nor dollar

   my clothes are in the next car berth
thirteen run get them for me and ill
give you a dollar 

   very sorry sah the porter replied sus-
piciously after a wary look at smith but
there aint no last car we cut it off at
cheyenne

  cheyenne why you fool we havent
got to cheyenne yet well be there though
in ten minutes and i want to get into my
own car 

  very sorry sah but we cut off nearly
an hour ago when we did all that switch-
ing guess you must have forgot to change
your watch when we changed time at green
river last evening that would make you
one hour slow

  what me on the way to denver in
the wrong car no clothes no money
say come here boy now you get some of
those gentlemen who were in here with me
thats a good boy and ill give you a dollar
soon as i see one of them hurry now
what berths sah am dey in

   what berths how should i know
look in all of them till you find them
very sorry sah cant do that no
ways everybodys asleep cant disturb
em how come you in here anyway who
is you am you the crazy man what ot
loose in cheyenne dey am lookin for
the porter backed out the door in a
hurry and locked it behind him

  smith mad as a hornet pounded on the
door this brought both the pullman and
the train conductor they unlocked the
door and at a glance at smith in his pink
pajamas edged away

   see here gentlemen just a friendly
little game i was in the other car the one
cut off at cheyenne and my clothes are in
there also my wife and money and tick-
smiths last game



ets-everything my three friends won
all ray money and thats how im here in
this fix thats one of them now  point-
ing down the aisle to anderson

    do you know this man   asked the con-
ductor

  never saw the poor fellow before in my
life replied anderson with a pained air

   andy you-you villain ill break
every bone in your body 

  look out boss hes giftin vilent
gasped the porter as he ducked around the
corner of the drawing-roonv the conductor
locked the door again while word about the
 crazy man in the drawing-room  went
through the car

   presently the door was opened a little and
a package shoved in

smith jumped for it
with joy 

 what the
deuce  he groaned
as he found a safety
razor and a note
saying we might
be able to recognize
you if your head
was shaved sorry
we havent any clip-
pers

    of all heartless
pirates  groaned
smith then with
a sickly grin he re-
called a certain
pullman car of a
year ago and
reached for the soap
on the wash-stand

it was something of
a hard job but in
ten minutes he had
shaved his head as
clean as a billiard-
ball and a sight
he looked then he
rappe once more on
the lockd door

  the firgt glance
the conductors and
passengers had of
him caused a riot

  hes the one thats him crazy as a
loon get that razor away from him or
hell kill himself

  how they did yell

  say you idiots heres your razor if
you want it now andy make good

identify me and lets end this nonsense
begged smith

   his own mother wouldnt know him
commented anderson as he surveyed the
shining pate thrust through the door this
recalled to smith the same remark now one
year old he glared at the three friends
back in the car shook his fist and sub-
sided to a corner and fumed in silent fury

  meanwhile the conductor had wired
ahead to fort morgan for an officer the

i is

its only one oclock and we
dont hit cheyenne till two

train was stoppednand the country cop was
told diat there was a crazy man on board

  i dont want him take him along to
denver good night was all the satisfac-
tion the conductor got

  by this time it was nearly daylight the


the railroad mans magazine

they handcuffed smith and bundled him into the wagon

conductors considered the matter of putting
smith off the train then and there because
he had no ticket and the pullman conductor
urged that it was against the rules of the
company for passengers to travel in a draw-
ing-room without tickets and especially
without anything on but a suit of pink pa-
jamas

  for humanitys sake the conductors al-
lowed smith to ride in the drawing-room
merely contenting themselves with wiring
the facts to headquarters in denver and
passing the whole matter to those higher
up at the frantic request of their prisoner
however on the mere strength that after all
there might be a mistake somewhere the
conductor wired

  mbs j j smith car  alpine berth 

    u p flier care conductor james

    man on denver sleeper in pink pajamas
  says he is your husband if so wire instruc-
  tions to u p headquarters denver

  as the train pulled into the denver sta-
tion a telegram was handed the conductor
that read

    i have just as much husband with me right
  now as i have had on this whole trip

                      mrs j j smith

  doesnt say much yet it seems to say
a good deal depends on how you look at

it remarked the
conductor just
then the patrol-
wagon drew up
to the train

  youve got
that escaped lu-
natic on board
andwe cant take
any chances the
sergeant said so
they handcuffed
smith and bun-
dled him into the
wagon the three
chums sympa-
thetically - stood
near by and
rubbed their
hairy heads in
unison as the
wagon rolled
away for head-
quarters

  smith was led
into the chiefs
office his sha-

to rosalia philip finds that he is suspected not only of old caillos death but also that of gorm-
ley he decides to marry carmita at once and take her north on his way to see the padre for
that purpose he is set upon by two men claiming to represent the citizens of rosalia and dele-
gated to escort garrick out of town escaping from them he takes refuge in the old mission and

the finding of the body of one of his assailants and there is mysteriously shot

chapter xiii
the scene in rosalia

in a moment pandemonium reigned
in the city of rosalia the mob
quickly divided itself into the
sympathizers of philip garrick
 and the upholders of the man
who had shot him it was im-
possible at first to get to the wounded man
so dense and noisy was the surging humanity
that gathered about the court-house steps

  philip was gradually growing uncon-
scious blood was gushing from the wound
in his breast padre gregorio was kneel-
ing over him supporting his head and ap-
pealing to the crowd to keep back and give
him air

  two deputy sheriffs rode into the mob
flourishing their six-shooters and threaten-
ing the life of any man who dared oppose
their orders or block their path they forced
an opening to the wounded rancher when

the- reached his side he was absolutely be-
yond the conscious stage and was breathing
heavily

  with the aid of padre gregorio philip
garrick was placed astride the saddle of
one of the deputies his body seemingly
lifeless and limp as a rag was held upright
by one arm of the deputy for the other was
needed in case of interruption-and then the
six-shooter would talk

  padre gregorio took the horse by the
bridle and led the animal in the direction
of the hospital the upraised hand of the
priest was the signal for order the mob
stepped aside and the slow journey to the lit-
tle white hospital that stood on the outskirts
of the city was safely made

  they carried philip to the operating-
room while the crowd surged outside
padre gregorio his friend in the safe hands
of the surgeons went among the people and
begged them not to judge too harshly

   you have no finger to point against this
man except the finger of suspicion he said

began in the november railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

 that is not what wen do he is wounded
-maybe-fatally you must be charitable
even as he was charitable to you-and i
know that he is charitable for he is a good
man

  are you certain asked one

   i know him i will stake my life and
my faith on his honesty

  further argument drew a majority to
philips side padre gregorio was the lead-
er of the moment the leading business
men of rosalia and the ranchers who knew
philip and were his close friends asked die
priest to do his utmost to keep the crowd in
order

  first we must find the man who did
diis said padre gregorio

  it didnt take long to put two and two
together

  the body of dick bender--the dead man
found in the road-the fact that bender
had been the companion of seth waters
and the sudden disappearance of seth wa-
ters himself turned the tide of suspicion
only in one direction	r

  seth waters had killed dick bender and
seth waters had attempted the life of philip
garrick

  that was the verdict arrived at by every
man in rosalia whether he believed in gar-
rick or not if garrick had not been shot
by waters why didnt waters come forth

  a posse was formed and began to scour
the hills but waters the knowledge of
one murder resting lightly on his mind was
sleeping the sleep of a child dreaming of
the great city in the north whither he would
ultimately wend his way and be safely
drawn into its great vortex

   in a crowded city he wisely conjectured
he would be safer from capture than on the
farthest plains or in the deepest thicket

chapter xiv

the love of carmita

tyhile the surgeons were probing for
the bullet in the breast of philip
garrick a carriage was hastily driven to
the hospital door as the foaming horses
-topped the door opened and out stepped
the beautiful woman for whom philip had
exposed his life

  carmita the tears streaming down her
olive cheeks rushed with staggering steps
up the stairs that led to the hospital en-
trance there may have been men in the

crowd then who hated and suspected her as
they hated and suspected philip garrick
but if they were they stepped aside to let
her pass

  no man could have-doubted the anguish
that was filling her mind none could deny
that her face mirrored a love so deep and
sincere that to have placed an obstacle in
its way would have been a sacrilege

  so they stood aside to let her pass some
of the men who hated her-and there are
men who can hate even a beautiful woman
-turned their heads away it was a mark
of respect

  take me-to-philip garrick she
cried  oh take me-take me to him 

  an attendant supported her and helped her
to the operating-room there in the dead-
ly quiet the unconscious man lay on a table
his upper clothing cut from his body the
white-robed doctors and the gray-gowned
nurses working swiftly in the minute me-
chanism of their calling hunting for the
lodging-place of the little cone of lead
watching with eager eyes for each faint burst
of respiration

  this sad and solemn activity was sudden-
ly rent by a piercing wail

   oh heavens  shrieked carmita he
is not dead

  had not the hands of the doctors been
unusually steady a serious result might
have followed

  two of the nurses ran to carmita they
caught her arm and held her back they
used brute force to keep her from the oper-
ating-table

  she wanted to throw herself on the body
of the man she loved and pour her hot
breath onto his fluttering lips she wanted
to infuse her life into his life she wanted
to force her living breath into his almost
breathless body her strength augmented
by the sight of him lying under the surgeons
knife almost succeeded in overpowering that
of the nurses but they kept her back

  let me speak to him let me speak to
him she shrieked

  one of the physicians turned to her and
said sharply

   you must leave the room madam this
man is in a serious condition we must
have perfect quiet in order to save his life

  this was more than she could bear with
a cry that touched every heart in the room
she threw her hands above her head and fell
in a faint

  it was merciful because it was necessary
in the hornets nest



that she be absent from the room the
nurses carried her out tenderly and placed
her on a couch in a neighboring apartment

  it took some moments to bring her back
to reason she insisted on going to the man
she loved the nurses forbade and to ease
her suffering they told her that the wound
was not fatal

  but the doctors had locked the door of
the operating-room they could not brook
further interruption they clearly knew
that to save the life of the man on the table
they would require the greatest silence in
order to ply their skill

  the trying nervous hours wore on in
the operating-room the man who was once
the most popular rancher in all the south-
land was hovering between life and death
in a room close by the woman he loved and
who loved him better than all else in the
world was slowly going into hysterics be-
cause she could not be at his side

  outside the populace was wondering if
it had not judged the wounded man too
harshly indeed even among the lawless
element of the ranges the taking of an
unarmed mans life was looked upon with
horror and as that spirit was whispered
from man toman and the facts were weighed
to their finest point even the strongest oppo-
nents of philip garrick declared that seth
waters must be brought to justice

chapter xv

something about seth waters

oeth waters was a type of the fron-
 tiersman that is fast fading into
romance indeed it is more than a possi-
bility that one might wander the length and
breadth of the west and not find his proto-
type or anything that approached him

  he was what might be called an educated
criminal the ethics of honor on which
most men build their careers were a blank
in his mind honor to him was only a
means to an end if it occurred to him that
murder were necessary to gain a point he
looked upon the consummation of the deed
as only another life sacrificed to a purpose

   seth was close to fifty years of age at the
time of this story he stood nearly six feet
in his stocking feet his health was per-
fect the body and brawn of the mountain-
eer served him well he could not recall a
days sickness he boasted that he could
eat-and drink-anything that he feared no

man that his way was law and he obeyed
that most flimsy of all beliefs-that the world
owed him a living and that all he had to
do was to collect it in his own way

  just where he came from no one knew
only seth waters could answer that for
some reason or other he never said much
about his origin

  one day he rode into rosalia on the back
of a dusty mule-and lie attached himself to
the town in his kindly moments he was an
agreeable companion with those who liked
him for he could tell innumerable stories of
his escapades and adventures and a good
story-teller in his day was the most popular
entertainer in such a quiet commonwealth as
rosalia

  it was noticed by the more cultured people
of the town that he frequently spoke the
english language in a most perfect manner
although when lie was in his cups or playing
cards with the cattlemen he would use the
most ungainly patois of the time and become
as ungrammatical as a street urchin

  but what was most puzzling he had a
practical scientific mind - a mind stored
with all manner of useful knowledge regard-
ing chemistry and invention this was
known to such an extent by the people of the
little town that whenever any puzzling mat-
ter came to light the expression send for
setli waters was invariably used

  we left him in a valley close to the
borders of the river crood his tired mare
-his stolen but faithful steed-grazing her
fill of the succulent grass while he found a
sheltered spct under the trunk of a giant
sequoia and was soon asleep

  it was no trouble for him to sleep con-
science is the last thing in the human com-
pound to find surcease in repose but when
the human compound is devoid of all manner
of conscience sleep is merely a part of the
daily routine

  when seth waters awoke the sun was
already high above the hilltops the crisp
clear air laden with the tonic of the pines
put life into his veins and touched the edge
of his appetite his first glance was for
the mare he saw her still grazing some-
thing invisible told her that her master was
awake and she turned her head in his direc-
tion and neighed

  all right old girl said waters
straightening himself up  ill be with you
soon

  he scrambled down the bank to the river
tore off his clothes and plunged into the


the railroad mans magazine

cool water back and forth he swam the
great long strides of his powerful arms and
legs making a might wake that reached to
the opposite shore

  out in die middle of the river he stopped
and as he treaded the water he lowered his
lips to its level and drank his fill

  that would have to be his meat and drink
for hours maybe he knew that man can
live longer on water than on any other bodily
sustenance and with his customary philoso-
phy he drank till he could drink no more
then smilingly said this will keep me
for a while

  swimming back to the rivers bank he
stood on a dry rock in the hot sun until
every drop of water had evaporated

   these sun baths are fine he said to
himself so invigorating-and a good flesh
rub he continued as he plied his hands
over his body is the best way to create a
perfect respiration and perfect respiration
is one of the secrets of good health

  thus he mused as the sun sapped the last
drop of moisture and he slowly pat on his
clothes walking over to the mare he pat-
ted her neck fondly in a few moments he
was on her back and riding away

  he headed for the north-at least in the
direction that he surmised to be the north
he followed die river patiently and slowly
until he came to a point where the bluffs on
either side were so high that he could not
master them

  it was impossible to follow the bank-for
the bank and the bluff were one

  his intention was to go around the bluff
and strike the river at a more favorable
point with this in mind he turned the
mares head and started into the chaparral
for hours he rode but there was no opening
only a great forest enveloped him there
were naught but trees on all sides with birds
in innumerable quantities unbroken ground
that had never before known the tread of a
horses hoof or the foot of a man

  he kept on and on once he stopped at
a spring to let the mare drink and eat he
drank and ate also his food being the wild
blackberries that grew in profusion and the
eggs of a wild-fowl which he had come
across in a ground-nest and which he de-
voured raw

  his hunger appeased he began to think
in short he was getting serious - very
serious

  he looked at the sun he examined the
trees and hunted for animal trails and other

signs by which the hunter is guided-but

he was in a wilderness

  with perfect calm with a mind attuned
to the position into which he had thrust
himself he said half aloud to the mare

    we are lost

  he mounted and rode on

  night came-the deep black night of the
silent forest when-every rustling leaf sounds
like the footfall of death just as the last
spear of sunlight threw a shadow across the
treetops he reconnoitered for water

  he was thinking of the mare - not of
himself there was no water in sight the
grass seemed plentiful but water was more
important ta his mount than grass just then
the absence of it troubled him but there
was nothing else to do but stop for the night

  he staked the mare to a tree with his
hat for a pillow he stretched himself on the
ground- he could have fallen asleep but
he wanted to think just where he was on
the face of the earth was what troubled him
most he thought that he knew the sur-
rounding country pretty well there was
no other answer to it-he was lost

  in the morning he awoke early and rode
 and on-and still on he emerged from
the forest and found himself on a sandy
plain stretching far to the hills before him

chapter xvi
death valley

teath valley is a low desert in
southern california near the nevada
border-line it was christened by the sur-
vivor of an emigrant party of thirty who
late in the year  lost its way while
traveling through it

  after enduring indescribable sufferings
eighteen perished in the sands there is no
other spot on earth of a similar nature

   like all the great valleys of california it
lies oblong running from north to south
it is about fifty miles long and some thirty-
live miles wide and its surface is about two
hundred and ten feet lower than the level
of the ocean

  the panamint mountains on the west rob
it of the moist winds of the pacific ocean
in the middle of the summer its atmosphere
contains less than one-half of one per cent
of moisture its surrounding country is a
succession of volcanic ranges that form a
border of color-black red green yellow
and brown-giving the dried-up place a most
in the hornets nest



picturesque setting and furnishing the valley
with the beds of borax-the only thing that
has made it of any value

  death valley as seen from the summit of
the panamint range is a long gray waste of
desert traced with narrow bands of white
these are the thin deposits of borax to
the south one may see a narrow band of a
steely color it looks like a sword-blade
this is the armagosa river as it dies away
and sinks into the thirsty sands on entering
death valley it is a sluggish stream it
flows lingeringly along as if conscious of the
death that awaits it until absorption and
evaporation take it all

  the land was the center of a system of
lakes when the sierra nevadas had not yet
risen toward their summit the panamint
mountains are of carboniferous limestone
formation rifted and worn with a slight
growth of trees some are wonderful pines
others are mahogany and juniper near the
crests and below the vegetation becomes more
scarce

  in the gorges and narrow canons are nu-
merous vines and creepers on which grow
wild gourds resembling oranges similar to
the bitter desert-apples that grow near the
site of ancient sodom here also are the
most distorted forms of the cacti and an
inferior growth of greasewood or palaverde

  a sand-storm playing in death valley is
a wonderful sight sand-augers rise like
slender stems reaching up into the burning
atmosphere for thousands of feet and termi-
nating in a bushy cloud they travel hither
and yon and gradually fade from sight

   here mirage raises up spectral cities and
groves and fields and tree-margined rivers
a low ruin will seem to be hundreds of feet
high arrow-weeds are magnified into stately
palms and crows walking on the ground
appear as men on horseback besides the
crows there are seen a few poor lean jack-
rabbits a scattering of mangy coyotes some
hungry buzzards horned toads red-eyed
rattlesnakes and in the panamint range
there are still a few bighorns or rocky
mountain sheep

  at the summit of the panamint and fu-
neral mountains the thermometer falls to
thirty degrees below zero the mineral
wealth of this region is great in the pana-
mints are mines of antimonial silver-ore and
copper gold iron travertin onyx and mar-
ble in the funeral range gold silver lead
copper and antimony have been found in
paying quantities while the thick strata of

the east and southeast hills show almost
inexhaustible quantities of colemanite a bo-
rate of lime named for william t coleman
a san francisco merchant who was one of
the first to discover this deposit and its rich-
ness in borax

   very rich gold quartz has been taken from
the mines along the route traveled by the ill-
fated emigrant parties that dared its terrors

chapter xvii

the want of water

tarkness brooded over the face of
death valley star-sprinkled black
above sand salt and dust below silence
without motion this is night over the miles
on miles of gasping ashes of the valley
a withering fiend a world without water
death valley dries life to bones bones to
chalk chalk to dust dust we are and to
dust return is the alpha and omega of earths
most hideous ash-heap

   night rose like a curtain of black velvet
dawn a faint streak along the uncertain
horizon trembled upward and turned to
pearl morning blushed glowed red flamed
scarlet and suddenly paled the sun rolled
above the sky-line a dazzling blinding
burst of incandescent white

  under the gathering heat death valley
began to writhe and glitter like the sea
those level miles of salt and sand rippled
and sparkled like jeweled waves

   death valley is the sea-the sea without
water - a gigantic unreal sea where the
cloud and the fog and the mist are dust
where the spray is sand and the spume is
alkali and where the billows are rock

   alike to those who go down to the sea in
ships and to those who go forth over the
desert life is spelled in the one word-
water

   as the sun melted the eastern horizon and
even the shadows fled to the west death
valley awoke from the soft dim cruelty of
the night and squirmed just as it has each
morning for untold ages into laughing tor-
ture for every living thing gleefully dis-
dainful of everything but the hand of god
-yet sometimes at long rare intervals
conquered by man

  when the sun arose on this particular
morning death valley smilingly gloated
over a man stretched near to death who for
three days had been in itswaterless grasp

   three days before he had left lone rock


the railroad mans magazine

seventy miles away riding a roan mare
packing his own water risking all even
life itself he hoped to find more water in
forty skull water-hole but no rain had
fallen on death valley for many months
and fort- skull was dry

   forty skull was not only dry but baked
 and cracked at the sight the night before
 the tottering mare had swayed for a moment
 and then stumbled nose first into the sand
 -and died

   the man seth waters had drawn his
six-shooter against himself-for in death
valley suicide is no crime-then with one
last wild hope he had taken to the trail on
foot in the coming dark hoping that he
might meet another traveler in that dismal
waste-who had water

   but there was only one chance in a
thousand

   the night had worn on and on and out
into burning day again-and seth waters
lay babbling idiotically in the dry shadow
of a rock

   death valley laughed in its radiant way
 another victim to the millions of living
 tilings whose bones it had bleached and
 dried to dust for ages

   even birds in the air dropped to the fry-
 ing sands panted a moment then died dried
 and were blown away

   only the buzzards showed animation at
 first but dim specks they were beginning to
slowly circle over the dying man below
over all death valley the man and the
buzzards were the only signs of life-except
a creeping speck of white where the trail cut
the hot sky-line

 slowly crawling drawn by two weary
horses came a prairie-schooner canvas-cov-
ered followed by a staggering cow tied to
the tail-board in the wagon were an old
man two boys and a young woman

   an hour passed the man in the sand
his lips crusted with dried froth lay still
face down the wagon slowly creaked along
the trail until it came abreast of him then
it stopped

   father spoke the woman see

   she pointed with a whip to waters
stretched beside the wheel-ruts

   the old man looked down from the wag-
on and said no

   the woman drove on suddenly she drew
the rein reached into the wagon filled a tin
cup with water

   stepping from the wagon she went back
 to waters and held it to his lips he hardly

drank the water seemed to soak into his
cracked throat instead of being swallowed
 wa- water he gasped water

   i can spare no more answered the
woman perhaps i do wrong to let you
have even this and by doing so may be
robbing my own boys of life itself

   where can we find water   she con-
tinued  we have been short for two days
the team had their last water yesterday
which is the way to forty skull there
is always water at forty skull they told us
where is forty skull

  forty skullis dry whispered waters
then he reeled to his feet looked at the
woman with bloody eyes and demanded
hoarsely  have you no water  

  five gallons with two boys my father
the team the cow and myself to drink
she paused a moment and then continued
it is seventy miles to lone rock on the
back trail and i know there is no water
between here and there for i have just come
that way-

   sixty miles from high heel canon
where we left four days ago and every water-
hole dry on the way echoed the woman

  then that man and that woman looked
at each other not as man is wont to look on
woman nor woman on man for in each of
them was the same thought

  twenty quarts of water for five people-
no more within fiftv miles - and death
valley

chapter xviii

the modier of invention

dut a man will fight for a woman when
he will not fight for himself seth
waters silently put forth his hand raised the
woman from the dry dust of the trail and
led her back to the wagon

  no water-forty skull dry was all she
said to her father who took the death-sen-
tence as the old do-calmly

  the boys seized with the terror of the
sands began to whimper by brute force
seth waters grasped the water-can-but did
not drink turning to the woman lie said
thickly

   with this i could get to lone rock or
high heel but one thing prevents-i am
a man ill stay here with you let me
think-let me think

  his eyes roved over the contents of the
wagon then they swept the horizon
in the hornets nest



  not a cloud - not a cloud not one
for months yet right here sometimes the
heavens spill - why not now - water -
water - water in the middle of death
valley-no rain for months let me think
he rambled on

  waters doled out a cup of water to each
and washed out the mouths of the sweltering
horses then he once more overhauled the
wagon-load and with his eyes riveted on the
panting cow sat down to think

  he had a problem to solve the problem
that men have faced ever since man has been
on earth a problem before which millions
of men have failed and because they failed
have died

  seth waters sat there that hot august
morning amid the terrific beauty of the
desert looked at what were now his people
looked at the suffering cattle looked out
over the thirty miles of withering sands up
into the merciless sky and groaned
water he coughed water

  the woman was praying aloud but for
years prayer had been a forgotten tongue
to waters in the light of his twenty years
of frontier experience he gazed dully at the
kneeling woman and muttered labor is
the only prayer that is ever answered
then he fell to thinking once more and
his fevered eyes centered again on the cow

   milk   he mused  without water for
two days you have no milk even a bar-
relful would not save the horses and with-
out them water or no water what is the use
wring water from death valley 

  the thought threw him into a shiver of
grim silent laughter-merriment that is not
good for man to know for it borders close
on that of the maniac

  but you have blood he continued still
speaking to the cow  but of what use is
that ive seen it tried before and it means
only a harder death this is better and
he tapped his six-shooter-patted the hip-
weapon with that rare affection known only
to the westerner

   but in that hide of yours is water sev-
eral barrels of it nine-tenths of you is
water how-how ugh

  waters arose and once more looked into
the wagon-box then he began to unload
he tossed out a copper wash-boiler and
with a derisive laugh threw out a pump and
parts of a windmill then he kicked the
two empty water-barrels one on each side of
the wagon they ran hollow to his boot-

  o		o

toe lastly he threw onto the sand several

lengths of iron pipe also parts of the wind-
mill

  what have you got all this stuff for
here in the heart of death valley   he asked
of the woman

   we lived in kansas she answered list-
lessly as recalling a dream  my husband
and i and he died i took my two boys
here and my father and what of the old
home i thought we might need in california
and started on again that was part of it
-i brought it along for twas all we had

  then waters did something that to the
others seemed the outcome of an insane mind
first he cut the wagon-box to pieces-re-
duced it with the ax to a wood-pile-and
told the boys to collect withered sage-brush

  he rigged the iron pipe to the copper
wash-boiler by punching a hole through the
cover and pounding the metal tight about
the iron pipe the pipe he led into one of
the empty water-barrels 

  from the boiler set two feet off the sand
on four stones to the barrel was slightly
down-hill for the barrel rested on the ground
in a hole waters had dug with the ax be-
tween them reached the iron pipe for twenty
feet then he tried the pump but the
leather washers inside were dried and warped
-useless

  risking half a cup of the priceless water
he soaked it so that it held air-tight when
he tried the pump

  so far so good he said to the woman
who answered with a wan smile not under-
standing

  then he slaughtered the cow the hide
he cut into long strips and then sewed them
into a long six-inch bag or pipe of green
rawhide surrounding the iron pipe it was
burning noon now but waters did not stop
he again dealt out a cup of water all around
even to the horses

  the second water-barrel still air-tight
though nearly dried out waters covered
with air-tight rawhide and made two con-
nections one with the pump and the other
with the rawhide bag

  with the wood from the wagon-box he
started a fire under the copper boiler and
put therein a huge chunk of meat from the
carcass that lay on the sand

  the cover of the boiler he now loaded
down with a heavy stone as the fire gained
a smell of cooking then burning meat came
faintly then gushingly from the end of the
iron pipe that emptied into the water-barrel

  meanwhile waters had the two boys


the railroad mans magazine

pumping with might and main forcing air
into the closed barrel thus condensing it
when the air-pressure was nearly bursting
the rawhide cover he stopped pumping

  he put his bare hand to the wood and
jerked it away instantly it was nearly
burning-hot but it cooled as the meat in the
boiler turned to vapor

boys face death on engine pilot

three young boys whose homes are in al-
bany new york had a fast furious and
dangerous ride recently on the pilot of a locomo-
tive of the north adams express

  the boys who are charles child twelve years
old thomas funk fourteen years old and albert
marsh sixteen years old walked from albany to
chatham over the boston and albany railroad a
distance of twenty-one miles where they expected
to jump a freight-train for new york they
boarded several freight-trains the crews of which
put them off they then concluded that they
would walk down the harlem tracks to some sta-
tion where they might be able to board a train
without being noticed

  they-reached the hillsdale station at about the
same time as the north adams express driven
by engineer thojnas brissett and in charge of
conductor george marley arrived the three

boys were standing against the fence on the oppo-
site side of the station and as the train came to a
standstill they ran alongside of it to the front of
the locomotive where they climbed onto the pilot
and sat up close to the boiler-head

  it being dark they were not noticed getting on
the locomotive the train ran at a sixty-five-
mile-per-hour rate to north white plains a dis-
tance of ninety miles without a stop the north
adams express changed locomotives at this point
where the electric zone begins the engineer ran
his locomotive into the roundhouse

  in going to thfe front of his locomotive he dis-
covered the three boys huddled on the pilot almost
unconscious from the severe winds they had en-
countered in the ride of ninety miles he took
them off and helped them into the engine drivers
quarters where they had food and were warmed
up-new york evening sun

the worst workman and the best engine are alike in one thing
neither will go without being fired-the roundhouse foreman
on the middle-west main
lines

by john walters

 it is good to know that the railroads the bulwark of the entire industrial
 world of the western continent are showing an increase in earning power
 notwithstanding the economies and regulations to which they have been
 subjected during the past three years by perhaps a too severe legislation we
 present here a budget of information concerning the lines of the productive
 middle west and some other topics of keen interest to all who want to keep
 abreast of the railroad situation

why there is such a ishortage in cars - activity in freight - more and
larger moguls and mallets-the growth in illinois-

recent earnings

the railroads and especially
the coal-carrying roads of
ohio are being threatened
just now with a car short-
age such as has never been
known before in this coun-
try a prominent traffic official declared re-
cently  the railroads are threatened with
a car shortage and the country is facing a
coal famine-both of which are certain to
come this winter if present conditions can-
not be changed and the future situation re-
lieved

  authorities in the coal trade who have
been making a careful investigation say
that the coal supply for the coming winter
is now short by over twenty million tons
in the united states and that so far as
can now be seen there is no hope of bring-
 rr	

ing up the supply to normal conditions at
this season of the year

  the suspension of coal mining in the
states of illinois kansas missouri and
arkansas owing to the failure in setting
the mining scale until september will
cause a heavy shortage inthe territory
supplied by the mines in those states and
also in the other coal districts where mi-
ning was in operation

   because of this the latter districts will
be unable to take care of the future de-
mands because the supply will be drawn
too heavily upon by the general market

   the fact that the coal mines in the states
mentioned were closed down until recently is
one of the many causes of the present situ-
ation of a threatened car shortage during
the summer months the coal mines which
s

the railroad mans magazine

were being worked in pennsylvania ken-
tucky and die virginias were operated to
full capacity the product of these mines
was skipped to points far distant

  many of the cars in which this coal was
shipped have never been returned to the
roads where the traffic originated and which
own diese cars this condition has already
made the car shortage evident in the dis-
trict tapped by the hocking valley the
condition is acute

  general manager connors of the hock-
ing valley was obliged to send letters to
the general managers of all the roads which
connect with the hocking valley explain-
ing the situation he requested that all
hocking valley coal cars be returned to
that road as fast as they are emptied

activity in freight

  the almost unprecedented activity in the
freight movement all over the country has
pressed into service every available freight-
car and the railroads are finding it hard 
meet the demands made upon them dur-
ing each month of  business showed
an increase over the corresponding month
in 

  a peculiar phase of the western freight
shipments and they form the bulk of the
increase is the destination of the consign-
ments until this year the lower pacific
coast points and the middle western states
received a majority of the freight dur-
ing  however northern pacific coast
points in washington idaho utah mon-
tana and wyoming have been the heaviest
receivers the lower pacific coast points
have not fallen off in their demand but the
newer settled country is demanding a
greater amount of construction material and
manufactured goods than its sister coun-
try needs

  the shipments from the west to the east
have also increased little manufactured
material is sent east the bulk of the ship-
ments consisting of hides leather fruits
imported materials from the orient and
strange to say dynamite and blasting caps
these explosives are shipped in large
quantities a california concern supplying
most of the big manufacturing concerns in
the east

  of all objectionable freight from the
shippers point of view high explosives
probably stand at the head of the list
the national inspection bureau which

designates the manner of shipping this va-
riety of freight has decreed that it shall be
sent only in cars of a certain tonnage with
steel supporters packed in a certain man-
ner with no inflammable material in the car
the car must be liberally tagged with the
announcement that it contains explosives
handling and transferring a car-load of
percussion caps giant powder and dyna-
mite is not the most pleasant task in the
world

largest engine built

  two of the largest type of locomotives
ever built have been received by the duluth
missabe and northern railway the mon-
ster machines are in reality two locomo-
tives in one and are designed to have a
larger hauling power than any other two
engines ever used on hill runs these en-
gines will pull up a steep grade seventy
empty cars where the best done by the or-
dinary locomotive now in use by the com-
pany is twenty-eight cars

   each locomotive tips the scales at about
six hundred and sixty thousand pounds
a double set of cylinders - a higli-power
near the center and a low-power set in
front operate the sixteen monster driving
wheels each set of cylinders operates four
driving wheels on each side of the engine

   the boilers which look like monster cyl-
indrical tanks furnish a pressure of two
hundred pounds of steam

   it is not expected that the moguls will
eat up more coal than is now consumed by
ordinary locomotives used on hill runs all
the latest designs of machinery have been
installed on the engines to get the greatest
amount of power from them for the least
amount of fuel

  the engines are ninety-two feet long
from die pilot to the rear of the water-tank
they have been numbered  and 

still larger locomotives

   it is probable that within a few years
we shall see a five-hundred-ton locomotive
this statement was recently made by the
superintendent of motive power of one of
the largest railroad systems in the country
i can say that it is more than possible

    it would mean the expenditure of many
millions of dollars to strengthen the bridges
and road-beds of our road but i would
not be surprised to see such an engine
soon says the superintendent of motive
on the middle-west main lines



power of another great railroad the
engines we now have are capable of hauling
 trains as heavy as we are allowed to take
into chicago but in railroading as in
everything else the man who tries to set
a limit will find himself outgrown

   there is in service on the santa fe road
a freight locomotive which weighs 
pounds about  tons it created great
wonder when it was brought out a year ago
yet designs are already being drawn up by
a western road for a locomotive that will
exceed it in weight and a few months ago
there was delivered to the delaware and
hudson railroad one that exerts a pres-
sure of  pounds on the driving-
wheels alone

fifty more mallets

   the great santa fe engine exerts a pres-
sure of  pounds on the driving-
wheels that counts one of the features of
the new delaware and hudson locomotive
is the absence of the small trucks and the
placing of die entire weight on the driving-
wheels the advisability of this innovation
remains to be proven

  the santa fe has placed an order for
fifty additional mallet engines for deliv-
ery at the earliest possible date several
of these new monsters will be assigned to
the gulf lines increasing business from
year to year and gradual growth in loading
requirements demand these locomotives of
more power

  in fact these exactions-are growing so
stringent that the santa fe people have
placed an experimental order with the
baldwin locomotive works this calls
for a duplex locomotive designed by j w
kendrick vice-president of the santa fe
it will be an important experiment which
if successful will revolutionize present
transportation problems of railroads and
reduce present rate schedules

by rail to hudson bay

  the construction of the hudson bay
railroad will be pushed again as soon as
cold weather sets in and it is hoped by
next spring to have over half the trackage
finished for over a year the road has
extended as far as la pas

  the hudson bay line will be one of the
greatest stimulators the great north coun-
try will have it will serve a double

purpose firstly it will shorten the dis-
tance between die producer in the far north
of canada and the consumer in england
by making a great all-water route from
fort albany on the bay to liverpool
secondly it will take much of the cana-
dian traffic off the lakes and give over many
great steamship lines to american traffic
which it needs just now

   ten new oil-burning locomotives for the
western division of the hill roads will be
delivered soon and will go on the spokane
portland and seattle where they will be
used with fifty others already there the
company will begin work meanwhile on
changes that will convert many of the coal-
burning locomotives into oil-burners the
oregon trunk lines will also be supplied
with oil burners president john f
stevens who heads the western hill lines
is a believer in oil-burners from die stand-
point of economy in view of the cali-
fornia base of fuel supply

the claim of illinois

  illinois now claims to be the premier
railway state it claims nearly 
miles this includes the electric railways
the steam railroads already in operation
in  according to the report of the
interstate commerce commission totaled
nearly  miles in addition to these
lines various important new lines -and
extensions have been built bringing the
total up to the above figure

   the record is approached only by texas
and pennsylvania the lone star state
by reason of her vast prairies and intermin-
able distances has the largest mileage pos-
sessing at the latest official reports 
miles of railroads pennsylvania is the
only other close competitor with 
miles of track

which give a freight and passenger service
unequaled anywhere the suburban serv-
ice which has grown to be a factor of
the greatest importance in transportation
has been removed from the general field of
train operation and made a distinct fea-
ture of railroading thus giving better serv-
ice in both departments of travel

better equipment now

  illinois has witnessed a vast improvement
in the quality of her railroads during the
last ten years as well as a substantial in-
crease in the quantity in addition to the
improvements required by the state and in-
terstate laws the more prosperous roads
have entered into a rivalry in track im-
provement operating equipment and bet-
terment the block signal the telephone
system of despatching the improved road-
bed the construction of new stations the
automatic coupler the constant increase in
the size of locomotives and elaboration of
traveling appointments have all combined
to put the illinois lines on a high plane of
excellence

mr yoakums optimism

  b f yoakum chairman of the frisco
lines like nearly all the prominent rail-
road executives is unusually optimistic
he never tires of telling eastern capitalists
about the wonderful resources of the south
and southwest and few men can discuss
important questions more convincingly than
he

  in a speech at the oklahoma state fair
recently mr yoakum had for his theme
wagon roads and railroads hesaid
that the founders of this government had
no conception of the vast commerce inter-
ests which would move over  miles
of railroad instead of the little which then
dragged over a few miles of bad wagon
roads this was no reason however why
this new development should be treated in
any sense as lawless nor is there any rea-
son for attempting to arrest it because it
requires a readjustment of federal and
state jurisdiction as the commerce be-
tween states expanded and as transpor-
tation was extended a far-reaching con-
on the middle-west main lines



nected and interdependent industrial sys-
tem was created and this must be subject
to some system of law

   but after all said mr yoakum
this thing called interstate commerce
and these instrumentalities called railroads
represent the very vitals of our national
progress and the very health and wealth
of our whole people the people of the
country instead of being aroused by in-
flammatory appeals to adopt measures to
destroy them should be taught by enlight-
ened discussion to find some way to pro-
mote them and at the same time fairly
regulate them

                                                                

increased railroad earnings

  record earnings and record expenses are
shown by the interstate commerce com-
missions monthly reports of income returns
of the railways of the united states for
the year ending june   com-
pared with the previous banner year
 the earnings show an increase of
 and the expenses an increase
of  leaving  in-
crease in net income from operation to take
care of an increase of  in taxes
and the interest on at least 
new capital invested in the railways since


  between the high water marks of 
and  occurred the greatest slump in
operating revenues ever known in the his-
tory of american railways-the descent to
the bottom in may  and the slow re-
covery from which is shown in the follow-
ing statement -of earnings by months and
half years for the past three years un-
fortunately no official figures by months
are obtainable prior to july 

  more significant than the splendid recov-
ery of  or than the totals for  and
 are the figures for the half year end-
ing june   these are -
 below the earnings of the preceding
half year and nearly  below
these for the corresponding months of 
with which they are more properly com-
parable the six months from january to
june  is the mildewed ear that for
the past twenty-four months has blasted and
infected wholesome railway operations in
the united states

  in following the rapid increase in gross
earnings the public has lost sight of the
burden of forced and sometimes false econ-

omies the railways have had to bear as a
result of what happened to them in the
winter and spring of -

  while the figures for  are not prop-
erly comparable with diose for  owing
to changes in methods of accounting pre-
scribed by the commission they are suffi-
ciently so to enable the student to note die
sag in the two essential departments of
maintenance between  and  in
order to appreciate this at its true value
it is necessary to recall that between 
and  the charge for maintenance of
way and structures increased from -
 to  or well over
seven per cent annually instead of such
increase the table shows a decrease for
 and  while the larger figures for
 are very far from showing a normal
increase over 

  the figures for maintenance of equip-
ment in a lesser degree show the results of
the enforced economies of  and t
between s and  expenditures for
equipment rose from  to -
 or nearly twelve per cent annu-
ally

  any corresponding increases between
 and  would have necessitated an
expenditure of at least  for
maintenance of way and structures and
 for equipment in  with-
out providing anything for the deferred ex-
penditures of  and 

  that there is nothing speculative or un-
warranted about these percentages of in-
crease in expenditures for maintenance is
demonstrated by the fact that in  the
railways carried  per cent more pas-
sengers and  per cent more tons one
mile than they did in  and the traffic
congestion in  demonstrated the inade-
quacy of the decades expenditures for equip-
ment road and terminal facilities

mr harahans retirement

  with the passing of james harahan
from the presidency of the illinois cen-
tral railroad which must take place not
later than january   through the
operation of the pension system there will
come the close of one of the most strenuous
and interesting careers in the history of
american railroading mr harahan will
be seventy years old on january 

  of course said mr harahan in
speaking of his retirement  i feel deep re-
the railroad mans magazine

gret that i have arrived at the age where i
must retire but i suppose every man must
feel the same my deepest regret is in
having to leave the men with whom i have
been pleasantly associated so long i have
given the best of my life to the railroad
service and have taken great pride in see-
ing the illinois central grow from 
miles in  to  miles during that
period it has increased its yearly earnings
from  to 

  mr harahans first railroad job was a
clerkship with the boston and providence
road in s one year later he joined the
first massachusetts infantry and served
three years in the civil war he reentered
the railway service in  when he took a
position in the shops at alexandria virginia

  although mr harahan refuses to talk
about his success his ability to do most
of the things that he insisted others in the
operating service should do contributed
largely to it w l park his probable
successor was taken from the union pa-
cific where he was general superintend-
ent and was made vice-president of the
illinois central early in the year

railroads teaching farmers

  the railroads are teaching the farmers to
make two blades of grass grow where only
one grew before

  in some states the agricultural schools
are working hand in hand with the rail-
roads to teach the latest and best methods to
the farmers almost at their own farms by
uing cars as traveling laboratories lecture-
rooms and museums a writer in the farm
press says that the farmers need this sort
of instruction badly he quotes commis-
sioner coburn of the kansas state agri-
cultural college as thus defining what he
calls  the crime of agriculture  

  the average yield per acre is a dis-
grace the farmers are not seizing the op-
portunities among which they are thrust
they are not doing justice to the land and
climate with which a generous creator has
endowed them when they realize how
much more per acre can be produced by
only a little additional labor and at no great
additional expense and when they meet the
soil and climate half-way then the farmers
may be truly proud of their achievements

  commenting on this the chicago farm
paper goes on to note that the farmer did
not take advantage of the work of the agri-

cultural colleges until the experts decided
to take the mountain to mohammed
in the meantime we are told the railroads
beganto realize that they were not getting
the freight they wanted and they decided
that the crops would have to be increased

  at first corn was the subject tackled
and  corn specials  were sent out to en-
lighten farmers on the breeding and selec-
tion of corn its cultivation and harvesting
-in fact on every krinkle of corn culture
that leads to an increased yield and better
quality stopping at towns and villages
hamlets and way-stations they were met by
many farmers who could manage to take
off the few hours necessary to visit the train
and hear the lectures but to whom a trip to
the state agricultural college had seemed
like the mohammedans journey to mecca
a thing to be performed but once in a life-
time if at all the farmers had by the
way been duly notified beforehand as to the
exact hour of stopping so that they lost no
more than they had planned to give al-
ready results are very noticeable in many
sections by the increase per acre yielded in
the last two or three years but this con-
tact with the farmers in their own locality
only emphasized the need in the minds of
experts for instruction on all branches of
farming and it was not long before the
 dairy special  was going its rounds to
be followed later by trains covering other
subjects

  prominent among the roads which have
been from the start especially active in this
work are the northern pacific in the west
and the new york central lines in the
east and this year they took a long step
in the march of progress when they put on
their better farming specials made up
of trains of cars in each of which some one
branch of farming is treated the penn-
sylvania railroad has instituted a similar
service in the territory which it traverses
as one observer expressed it these trains
cover everything from the kitchen to the
pig-pen

  the plan of procedure is to have a meet-
ing between the farmers and lecturers in the
town hall at a stopping-point if it has one

  after the lecture the crowd is taken
through the train in detachments and a
demonstration lasting eight or ten minutes
is given in each car as one party passes
from the first car on to the next one another
party enters the car they vacate and in this
way there are eight or ten demonstrations
on the middle-west main lines

going on continually in the train which re-
mains from three to four hours at a stop

  however true the charge against the
farmers may be as regards their failure to
make the most of their opportunities in the
past they are proving by their attendance
upon the farm specials that they are
men of intelligence and willing to employ
progressive ideas when once they have had
the chance to acquaint themselves with such

  they are meeting these trains by the hun-

dreds and thousands and showing an en-
thusiastic interest in whatever the experts
have to show them so far as they have
had the chance to put the knowledge thus
gained into practise a large percentage of
them have done so with the coming of
another spring and harvest-time they will
place tangible results before us in proof of
the claim the experts make that the food
shortage may be staved off o long as man
inhabits the earth

 campaign against trespassers

pennsylvania adopts vigorous methods to rid its right-of-way of all
types of intruders

trespassing on railroad property has
caused the death of more than  people
in the united states in the last eleven years in
this same period more than  trespassers
havd been injured

  with a view of reducing to a minimum the
practise of trespassing on its property the penn-
sylvania railroad has determined to redouble its
efforts to secure on its lines that rigid enforcement
of the law against trespassing which in foreign
countries has done so much to decrease the num-
ber of fatalities resulting from trespassing on
railroads

  in  the pennsylvania railroad inaugurated
a vigorous campaign against trespassing and due
doubtless to this the number of trespassers killed
in  was only  in   lost their lives
in this way

  in the eleven years prior to january  
exactly  people who were on the pennsyl-
vania railroads right-of-way in violation of the
law in spite of thousands of warning signs along
the railroad were killed it is thus seen that in
the eleven years an average qf two trespassers a
day have been killed on pennsylvania railroad
property

  this long death roll is every year charged up to
the railroad even though these people are killed as
a result of their violation of the law under con-
ditions over which the company has no control

  it is not only tramps who are killed and in-
jured while trespassing though thousands of them
lose their lives in this way every year men of the
laboring class factory workmen their wives and
children who use railroad tracks as thoroughfares
are killed by the hundreds that the practise of
walking on railroad tracks isprevalent in indus-
trial districts gives added significance to the fa-
talities on the pennsylvania railroad system as a
result of trespassing

  the tracks of the pennsylvaniaare lined with
factories as they run through the densest indus-
trial section through territory which holds more
than half of the population of the united states
over  trespassers were arrested in 

  the pennsylvania railroad lias now posted its
tracks and stationed watchmen to see that warn-
ings against trespassing are respected by redoub-
ling its efforts the company is endeavoring to re-
duce the number of trespassers who are killed and
injured by an even greater number than it has done
in the last three years

  the cooperation of city and county authorities
has been solicited in this campaign heretofore
the actual punishment of persons violating the
laws forbidding trespassing on a railroads private
property has been infrequent the cost of im-
prisonment has deterred the local courts from
holding those arrested while trespassing on rail-
road property-machinery

the fine art of bridge
building

by otto schultz

there is no feature of railroad building in which so much depends on
careful construction and the maintenance of a large safety factor than
bridges and trestles tunnels may cave in and landslides block the
right-of-way but compared with the collapst of a high bridge all these are
as nothing

    fortunately for those who follow the iron trail american bridge builders
are recognized the world over as the most efficient and rapid workers of all
the engineering fraternity their work may be found not only in north and
south america but in europe asia and africa and are known as models of
safe and economical construction

    we present this month the first of two articles giving some of the hard
nuts these men have had to crack situations where nicety of calculation and
ingenious methods in overcoming difficulties have played an important part
you will find these two articles full of valuable information

some examples in bridge building when american hustling won out
against foreign competition moving bridges by
locomotives and other feats

nized by the bridge engineer are financial

commenting on this report gustav lind-
enthal a noted bridge engineer said

   i have no hesitation in saying that a
bridge with a span of  feet could be
built for the heaviest trains running at ex-
press speed fantastic as it may seem it
is nevertheless true that based on theo-
retical resources a bridge could be built
over the atlantic ocean which would be
perfectly safe resting on anchored piers
which the fiercest hurricane or the impact
of the heaviest steamer in collision could
not disturb and with long spans so high

pass beneath

  so long as one can be ferried across com-
fortably on a big liner there does not ap-
pear to be any pressing need of spanning
the atlantic with a steel highway but
smaller bodies of water in these modern
days are bridged at will provided always
that the precaution is observed of securing
the services of an american engineer

supremacy of our engineers

  it must be conceded that the first metal
bridge ever built was the cast-iron struc-
ture with a span of  feet erected over the
river severn in england in  and that
the firth of forth cantilever bridge at
queensboro scotland with its two main
spans of  feet each is the largest in
the world but with these exceptions all the
honors in bridge building belong to the
united states

  american engineers have built more
bridges better bridges and built them un-
der greater difficulties in quicker time and
at less cost than those of all other nations
combined the railroad bridge carrying
the greatest number of tracks is to be
found in america it is the thirty-three
track bridge which carries the erie rail-
road over a certain street in chicago the
only two railroad bridges in the world that
are built lengthwise of rivers are to be
found in the united states one of these
carries the santa fe over the rio galisteo
in apache canon near lamy new mexico
while the other enables the denver and
rio grande to get through a crack in the
granite heart of the rocky mountains two
miles west of canon city colorado known
as the  royal gorge which is more than
half a mile deep and has walls so nearly
vertical that from its depths stars can be
seen at noon as from the bottom of a well

  whenever a particularly difficult piece
of bridge building has been contemplated
anywhere in the world american engineers
have always been called on to do the work
the most spectacular feats of these man
spiders in spinning their steel webs in im-
possible places have always been per-
formed for the railroads

first bridges of wood

  timber being abundant and cheap was
the material employed in bridge building

some of the wooden structures erected dur-
ing the first years of the nineteenth cen-
tury were unparalleled in the history of
bridge building one of these notable
structures was the bridge across the dela-
ware river at trenton new jersey con-
sisting of five spans the center one of which
was  feet long

  it was built in - many years before
railroads were thought of yet when the time
came to establish railroad connection be-
tween new york and philadelphia this
sturdy old bridge was found to be strong
enough to bear the weight of trains it
was used as a railroad bridge until -
a period of nearly thirty years-before it
was replaced by an iron structure this
was the only old wooden highway bridge
in the world ever converted to railroad use

lasting wooden structures

  the portage viaduct on the erie rail-
road  feet high designed by silas sey-
mour in  built in  and burned
down in s has always been considered
the boldest attempt ever made in timber
trestles american wooden railroad bridges
have given wonderful service the last of
the wooden bridges on the philadelphia and
reading consisting of two spans  feet
and  feet at port clinton built in 
stood up under the steadily growing traffic
until it was replaced with a steel structure
in july  a period of thirty-one years

  recognition of american supremacy in
bridge building has not been limited to
americans m m malezieux ingenieur
lecole des pouts et chausses who in 
was sent by the minister of public works
of france to study methods of construction
in england and the united states said in
his official report

    in bridges we saw nothing original nothing
  to be compared with the instructive noetics
  of america

  when henry meiggs the spectacular
american who went to south america to
build railroads some thirty years ago had
amassed railroad contracts aggregating
 he was about the easiest
mark for solicitors that ever appeared no
man who applied to meiggs for a contract
went away empty handed-that is for
a while

  later in the proceedings no contractor
who could not prove that he was a free-born
american citizen and who did not have the


the railroad mans magazine

grip and password could get a red cent out
of senor enrique how this great change
was wrought was clearly set forth in a let-
ter written by meiggs in reply to inquiries
from a mr slater a contractor on a gov-
ernment railway in chile who sought in-
formation the letter dated lima janu-
ary   read in part as follows

    i am in receipt of your favor of nov 
  concerning french bridges i must say for
  these countries at any rate they are a com-
  plete failure they may perhaps stand well
  enough when once erected but when i tell
  you that the french contractors were en-
  gaged on the oroya railroad three months
  and twenty-four days putting up a single-
  span lattice-girder bridge a little over fifty
  yards long against three months and fifteen
  days occupied by our men on the varrugas
  viaduct  feet long with three piers one of
  which was  feet high you can form an idea
  of the fearful cost of ttansportation caused by
  such delays amounting on this road to more
  than the valv e the bridge

    i have be n still more unfortunate in my
  experiments with english bridges two of
  which failed miserably on the pascamayo rail-
  way so after all these trials i have returned
  entirely to the american market for all bridges

  meiggs might have added a wealth of
interesting details but he didnt for in-
stance he might have told that the order to
the foreign contractor was for three single-
track bridges of  feet span when the
first one was erected it collapsed under the
weight of three cars which was only one-
twentieth of the load it should have carried

a few comparisons

  it was lost in deep water with the cars
and three men who happened to be on them
the foreigner rebuilt the bridge on the
original abutments this time the bridge
fell down under die weight of five cars be-
fore there was a chance to remove the false
work

  an american then put up a bridge that
would stay up the last foreign bridge to
collapse weighed  tons cost 
and required eight weeks to erect the
american bridge that replaced it weighed
only sixty-one tons cost  and was
put up in eight days the third foreign
bridge is still lying at pascamayo just where
it was unloaded from the ship unless some
enterprising peruvian youngster has sold it
for junk

the varrugas viaduct to which meiggs

referred was a job which attracted world-
wide attention it was fifty-one miles from
callao and  feet above sea level be-
ing  feet long and  feet high it re-
quired a lot of iron all of which had to be
shipped to the spot on the backs of mules

  the building of the trail for the mules
along the fearful slopes and gorges of the
andes cost more than the grading of some
american railroads even at that the trail
was so perilous that ten or twelve mules
tumbled off it into the depths below every
day

  sometimes the iron could be recovered
but the mules werent much use how-
ever a few hundred mules more or less
were nothing to a man who could afford
to spend two hundred thousand dollars in
gold to celebrate the completion of a rail-
road and charter steamships and build roads
to gather his guests he kept a herd of
 mules at it until the material was
assembled

 examples of american hustling

  then l l buck an american who
has since made a great name for himself
took charge he strung eight wire cables
across the chasm from which he suspended
tackle by which the tall towers for the
bridge were erected after the towers were
up buck with a construction gang con- 
sisting chiefly of common sailors picked up
in callao finished the job in ten days and
did it so well that a party of insurgents dur-
ing one of the frequent peruvian revolu-
tions tried in vain to tear it down

  it was a barren triumph however for
london engineering in a ponderous edi-
torial proved that he couldnt have built
such a bridge in so short a time and as if-
that were not enough a hood came down
the ravine carrying with it boulders
weighing fifty tons and swept the bridge
to the bottom it was replaced in  by
a cantilever structure designed by buck

  as another example of american hus-
tling the louisiana bridge across the mis-
sissippi will serve very well this bridge
which had a draw span of  feet a work
of great magnitude was completed in less
than seven months

  a span of the cairo bridge across the
ohio  feet long was erected in six
days two spans were erected the false
work and traveler being erected for each
span and taken down and put up again
the fine art of bridge building



for each span in one month and three days
no work being done on five days of this
time compare this with the construction
of the godavari bridge at rajahmundry
on the east coast railway in india -

  the bridge  feet long in fifty-six
spans of  feet was begun november 
 and was not opened for traffic until
august   it actually took those
englishmen by their own account an aver-
age of twenty-one hours to lift one pair of
girders and seat them in building the
krisna bridge on a branch of the great
india peninsula railway between bombay
and madras the builders doddered over
each span for six weeks

contractors were too slow

  with this glimpse of british methods it
is easy to perceive why the egyptian gov-
ernment turned to america when in 
it needed a bridge in a hurry to get kitch-
ener across the atbara river to chase the
mahdi out of the sudan the army offi-
cers first asked british bridge manufactur-
ing firms how quick they could turn out a
rush job time just then was of more
consequence than money the best the
britishers could do was seven months for
a modest little bridge of seven spans of
 feet each weighing altogether only
 tons

  fearing that in seven months the mahdi
might get tired of waiting to be whipped
and do something really unpleasant to
kitchener the london agents of the egyp-
tian government on january  
cabled to the pencoyd steel works asking
if the american firm could do the job the
answer was in the affirmative

  on january  the specifications for
the bridge were received on january 
the pencoyd people cabled their bid which
was accepted as quickly as the message
could be flashed under the ocean and
march  saw the steel for the entire bridge
shipped to alexandria

beyond their comprehension

  the pencoyd company undertook to turn
out the steel and get it on shipboard in
forty-two days this was actually accom-
plished in forty days

  thirty-two days more sufficed to erect
the bridge though it could have been done
in six days less but for a storm that stopped

all work yet as the atbara was a tor-
rential stream the bridge had to be erected
without false work

  maybe there wasnt a row in england
about it the army officers who were re-
sponsible for sending the order to america
were abused until the english press ran out
of ink and epithets then they said it
wasnt so anyway a mr rigby of the
firm of rigby  westwood one of the
british bidders said in an interview

    i simply do not believe that any firm in
the world can turn out a bridge of that size
in the time mentioned we and other
british firms made special efforts to secure
this particular contract at a meeting of
our directors who are all connected with
large steel works it was agreed to divide
the supply of the required material and let
other orders wait

   we made a very low tender guarantee-
ing delivery by april  but no tenders of
british firms were even acknowledged of
course the bridge has undoubtedly been
shipped from philadelphia but i absolutely
decline to believe that work commenced
february  the american firm either had
the specifications beforehand or adopted a
standard bridge to suit the requirements of
the case no other explanation is pos-
sible

an american bridge in burma

  another case in which some britishers
wanted a bridge they couldnt get at home
was that of the gokteik viaduct in burma
on the line from mandalay this struc-
ture one of the famous viaducts of the
world  miles inland from rangoon and
 feet above sea level is  feet long
 feet high and contains  pounds
of steel

  this quantity of material together with
that for the great traveler weighing -

	pounds with which it was erected
had to be shipped from rangoon over a
narrow-gage road with four per cent grades
on which eighty tons made a train-load

  seventy american bridge builders went
out with the material they began con-
struction in january  and with the
aid of five hundred natives who thought
their pay of seventeen dollars a month ex-
ceptionally good finished the job in oc-
tober of the same year the fourteen tow-
ers were erected with the traveler which
had an overhang of one hundred and sixty-


the railroad mans magazine

five feet again there was such a row in
england over the impudence of the ameri-
cans that lord george hamilton secre-
tary of state for india wrote as follows to
the london times

     in the case of the gokteik viaduct the bur-
   ma railway company had no option but to
   place the order for its construction with the
   pennsylvania steel company there were no
   british firms who had anything like the same
   experience in this class of construction the
   tender of the pennsylvania steel company was
   much less in price and quicker in time than
   any of its competitors

  because one has the good fortune to be
an american it does not necessarily follow
that one is therefore a born bridge builders
the new york canal commissioners found
this out when the first enlargement of the
erie canal was undertaken in 
knowing that some hundreds of bridges
would be required and wishing to have a
uniform design the commissioners asked the
chief engineers to submit plans

  when all the plans had been sent in the
commissioners thought the could make
something a great deal better so they took
a feature out of this plan and a dab out
of that and more or less out of the others
and fixed up a crazy-quilt design that was
altogether lovely in their eyes they pre-
sented it to the engineers as a masterpiece
of genius and ordered it adopted as the gen-
eral plan for all the bridges on a canal
three hundred and fifty miles long

  john b jervis told the commissioners
such a bridge could not stand up but they
attributed this remark to professional jeal-
ousy and went ahead the first bridge
built at utica tumbled down as soon as it
was completed and killed two men the
second at syracuse also toppled over the
moment the false work was removed

  the president of the mexican national

to be oo

 railway in  conceived the clever idea
 of saving some money by manipulating bel-
 gian iron with american brains so after
 securing some americap plans for bridges
 lie trotted over to belgium and placed con-
 tracts for the material much cheaper than
 he could have done in the united states

   but when the bridges were shipped the
 iron turned out to be so wretchedly inferior
 that some of the eye-bars actually broke be-
 fore ever reaching mexico then the engin-
 eers tested a number they all broke at -
  pounds per square inch or less while
 the lowest for american iron was 
 pounds the whole lot of bridges was con-
 demned and the road on which large sums
 had been expended was bankrupted

   some of the cleverest feats of the bridge
 magicians have been performed in the
 avork of rebuilding railroad bridges have
 to be rebuilt almost as soon as they are com-
 pleted not because they are not made prop-
 erlv but because the operating department
 keeps increasing the size of cars and loco-
 motives so rapidly that a bridge which in
 the spring is deemed amply strong to sup-
 port the traffic for several generations is
 discovered in the succeeding autumn to be
 altogether inadequate for the growing loads
 it is called upon to bear

   no railroad management was ever known
 to discover that a bridge needed rebuilding
 until it was wanted immediately this
 means that some pretty lively hustling has
 to be done by the bridge department and
 of course traffic must not be interrupted

   the engineer who laid out a passenger-
 train for a minute or two no matter what
 kind of a bridge he was rebuilding could
 confidently count on having something
 pretty harsh said to him as soon as the
 president could get to the wire this con-
 dition leads to some phenomenal records in
 handling ponderous masses of steel

  t is often so difficult for users of pipe to dis-
  tinguish iron pipe from steel that a few hints
  the subject may be found helpful the scale
  steel pipe is very light and has the appearancc

  ath being smooth and rather white on iron pipe
  s scale is heavy and rough steel pipe seldom
  caks when fattened but when it docs break

 because of softness of the metal
getting easy money

 by emmet f harte 

            honk and horace for a brief moment
            enjoy a rich reward for baffling a brigand

fomebody came along one day
and tacked up a dodger on the
waiting-room wall neither
 time expense nor skill had been
squandered on that dodger it
had been struck off how-come-
you-so on rotten paper with
cheap ink but it set forth specifically three
facts of importance

  first that a depot presumably contain-
ing ticket telegraph baggage express and
accident insurance privileges located in the
town of pleasant lake montana had been
looted to the tune of-they never tell you the
exact amount-

  second that the brigandage robbery
thieving outlawry or dastardly deed in
question had been performed accomplished
perpetrated and pulled off by a lone bandit
described to wit height about  feet 
inches age about thirty-five build stocky
hair and eyes dark brown scar over right
eye wore black slouch hat and black rain-
coat and-

  third that a
reward of five
thousand dollars
would i e paid
for the before-
described young
gentleman duly-
apprehended and
delivered or upon
satisfactory proof
of his demise dur-
ing the process
of such apprehen-
sion and delivery

 honk and i
read it over and
palavered about it

considerably while we were resting every
now and then we couldnt either of us
recall an instance where anybody had ever
caught or killed a brigand and collected
a wad of easy money like that but it ap-
pealed to us nevertheless

  i shouldnt wonder if it wasnt because
we were a couple of devil-may-care fellows
who relished personal danger and hazard
for the sake of the pure excitement of it in
fact we would both go out of our way to-
hows that i didnt say to avoid danger
oil very well never mind

   it would be too much to expect that the
rummy would ever light around this neck
of the woods remarked honk to me  in
the first place hed have  occasion to
come to valhalla it being no suitable haven
for crooks and moreover anybody with the
sense that is set apart for little geese would

the railroad mans magazine

know better than to try to sneak past us
wed nail em on the spot my clairvoyant
sense would detect em at once

    right  i agreed  wed detect em as
far as we could see em-maybe but say
what would we do with-well five thou-
sand dollars now for instance if we had
it all paid down in crackly yellow and
brown fifties and hundred-case notes i
believe id lay off another month-

   why need you your job is an endless
vacation as it is i know what id do with
my share id buy that new ruhmkorff coil
and die big concert grand phonograph weve
been wanting and then id sit back in a new
leadier rocker with a fan and a panatela
and a colored boy to bring me cracked ice
for my lemonade-and under the table id
have a bucket with four gold-labeled
dust-- 

  and wed send off for caviar and reed
birds and a barrel of oysters bearded like
the prophets of old and wed have pheas-
ants and rice and chop suey cooked by an
imported chop su-maker i murmured with
rapturous and shining eyes

  hush he said in another minute
you wont leave me nothing to tell

  although the matter did-not come up for
discussion again for several days we could
not entirely dismiss the idea of that five
thousand in the meantime i noticed honk
scrutinizing every newcomer very narrow-
ly and whenever i saw anybody who looked
anywhere near five feet eight and sge
about thirty-five my left palm would begin
to itch which is an almost infallible sign
that im going to get money

  not even my most intimate acquaintances
were entirely exempt from suspicion during
this period so far as thats concerned
though it is sometimes a stroke of good
business policy to be uspicious of your best
friends for instance theres that  ill-
hand-this-to-you-saturday  gag and the
guy that wants you to make a talk for him
up at the shoe store so he can work his face
tor a six-dollar pair of kicks the day before
he leaves town forever

  but there i go holding another autopsy
while the gang is waiting for the score

  so far as i was implicated in this man-
hunt the prize money began to look dim
and miragic to me as soon as id had time
to cast up a brief census of everybody in
and near valhalla i couldnt even fasten
the thing on butch poteets father-in-law
while i harbored all sorts of villainous

opinions and ugly intents toward my fel-
low citizens i would have been compelled
to admit under cross-examination that i
couldnt lay my hand on the pleasant lake
bandit if id had to and that five thous
was some incentive too if theres anything
i wouldnt make a stab at for five thous
what it is lias clear slipped my mind

   as is usual however just when i dccided
that there was nothing doing honk struck
what he classified asa clue he broached
the subject to me one evening while we sat
on the observation platform of the medicine
house listening to the cicadas cicada-ing in
a near-by sycamore tree

   i see theres a fellow stopping at henry
hintons who never came in on the motor-
car he remarked

  the aforesaid henry hinton was one of
the poor white trash truck-farmers out
 by the reservoir he owned a five-acre tract
-that is hed paid a hundred dollars on it
and was behind with the rest of his pay-
ments

    this person answers to the name of tee-
garten-ezekiel or zeke teegarten hes
about five feet eight and might be thirty-
four or thirty-six years old according to
the light he looked thirty-two to me
but it was cloudy this morning when i saw
him he claims to be a cousin of hin-
tons

    how did lie get here if he didnt come
on the train i asked did he come on
horseback in an auto or blow in on a
biplane 

  neither one of the six honk vouch-
safed  he hoofed it in i made a few
judicious inquiries this morning he is
supposed to ve come from kankakee illi-
nois on foot for his health he is weston-
ing his way westward for the benefit of his
lungs or indigestion or neuralgia or some-
thing presumably

  he appears just about stiffand sore
enough to me from a distance to have just
about piled off from the rods of some night
freight-train at millardsville and walked
 over here during the wee small hours

    well i said scratching my left palm
wed better slip over and get him this
evening hadnt we it would be very dis-
heartening to make the arrest to-morrow or
next day and find him gone an arrest
without an arrestee i declared sagely is
as unsatisfying as a clam-bake without
clams

    yes but -it might not be our man  
getting easy money



   im convinced its him i said from
your description it must be him my sakes
-besides we need this reward money
mighty bad let us arm ourselves go out
quietly and you can secure him while i keep
watch at the gate to see that he dont elude

  we approached warily in fact as old
uncle tobe in the town where i was raised
used to say when describing one of the bat-
tles he participated in endurin ob de
war we snuck up froo dem dar weeds
des lack ku-kluxers it wasnt late

speak up you old bucca-
neer  wheres the dough  

you then well put him through the third
degree make him cough up the hiding-place
of his loot and wire for the officers to bring
on their prize money it will be as easy as
catching chiggers in a weed-patch

  it required sor urging to get honk
sufficiently warmed to it i was even forced
to play my big trump i e that lie was
afraid to go out and help arrest this ezekiel
teegarten person before i got him started
i was crazy about that five thousand my-
self i tell you

  we armed ourselves i took the target
rifle and honk his trusty old navy revolver
then we stole sleuthfully into the night

  henry hinton lived in a manor house
that in the gloaming oh my darling might
easily be taken for a common shack a
numerous noisy colony of dogs of various
sizes and ancestry made the premises a
stamping-ground

henrv and his supposed cousin sat smoking
their pipes on the lawn-or the place where
the lawn should have been

  we held a whispered consultation
honks feet began to chill just a trifle

    i tell you we might be too precipitate
in this he insisted you cant jump in
and pinch anybody haphazard and hit-or-
miss without no warrant or anything but
an empty suspicion what if the guy wasnt
-guilty he might get pretty sore about it
dont you think  

    oh hell be sore anyway as far as that
goes i whispered airily  if-he can prove
that lies innocent why well let him go
thats all there is to it what more can
he ask than that what im trying to
beat into your batter-cake of a brain is
this that hes liable to be the man we want
and we cant afford to take chances on him
getting away better that ninety-jnine inno-

cent should suffer than one guilt escape
i quoted  think of that five-

  all right all right he said grumpily
had we better rush in by main strength
and clumsiness or use a little suavity and
stratagem  what do you think-or do you
ever maybe youd better saunter up and
ask to borrow a bicycle pump or something
and grab his hands then i can come and
help tie him with a rope-by george we
forgot to bring a rope 

   how would it do to crawl quietly along
the fence to where we can hear what they

  taint no more dangerous than sol-
dierin hen an look at the diff-runce
in the pay if i wuz you id quit this
farmin as quick as i could pack my grip
of course it aint like clerkin in a store
but you can make more money in one month
than you ever could here in your whole
life

  aw its too much scramblin around in
the dark zeke i never would git used
to that

   yes you would youd git sos you
could see like a cat    an then you dont

are talking about if youre so picayunish
about the fellows innocence i suggested
mayhap the caitiff will convict himself
by his own word of mouth

  honk was perfectly agreeable to this so
we did the lizard act to the windward
that was a move in the right direction for
the immediate vicinity of the shack was
alive with dogs and if they had caught
our scent we would have been the focal
point of an uproar that could have been
heard for miles

  the same balmy breeze that carried away
the odoriferous evidence of our presence
also brought us snatches of conversation we
could use in our business something like
this

   yes but zeke you take it all around
and its durned dangerous work you never
know what minute-

have to work in any one part of the coun-
try all the time you can go east or west
or north or anywhere you want to    the
biggest killin i ever made wuz in-
maybe theres other rewards out for
this guy i whispered to honk signifi-
cantly

  well find out he replied hes a
bad egg and no mistake lets worm back
to the road and come up on them from
the front

  this we did we stopped at the fence
and halloed a riotous chorus of howls
yelps and ki-yis greeted the hail when a
lull came punctuated at intervals by the
yap of some cur that had just arrived from
a distance we climbed the fence and made
ourselves known to hinton

   seen anything of a spotted setter pup
hereabouts askel honk improvising an

that face was a hard looker
to fasten on the front of
anybodys cranium
getting easy money



excuse were looking for one you
seem to have a pretty fair assortment here
from the noise they make

    its the fellers that run the depot we
heard hinton tell his companion

   no i dont knows ive saw your dawg
he replied  but you cn take a look amongst
the bunch if you want to 

   hinton had no family whose peace might
be disturbed so we felt no qualms at kick-
ing a dog or using unparliamentary lan-
guage to defer the boldest from securing
souvenirs out of our legs

   after making a desultory search we de-
cided that the lost pup was not among those
present and paused to chat a minute

  this heres my cousin from illinoy
names teegarten hinton said

  teegarten said honk any kin to
the teegartens in streator illinois

   got an uncle there said our man
grouchily

  whats his first name

  john

  listen to that horace said honk
a nephew of old john teegarten at
streator away out here you boys have
got to go down and have a drink on that-
weve got a brand new jug-just came to-
day  whod ve thought wed find a man
from the old home country up here get
your hats both of you-youve got to come
thejjrospect of a free drink or two is a
potent dispeller of erstwhile dulness and
indifference in citizens of the hen hinton
and zeke teegarten persuasion they came
like little piggies to the lure of the slop-
trough

  sure thing said hinton never was
more willin in my life was you zeke
 never a time said our prospective
bank-roll

  thus does acumen and sagacity triumph
over the coarser and less discreet methods of
the knock-down-and-drag-out school of
criminal catchers it is the supremacy of
the trained detective over the village night-
watch the preponderance of brain against
brawn the vindication of mentality as op-
posed to the old-fashioned water-elm club

   we led the way in high glee escorting the
not particularly valuable looking zeke but
worth five thousand to us by the shortest
cuts to the medicine house on arrival at
that temple of progress and seat of learning

i dallied with friend hinton on the outer
battlements for a minute while honk play-
fully shoved ezekiel ahead of him through

   	r r

the gangway and introduced the muzzle of
his forty-four caliber persuader under the
gentlemans right ear

  it was done quietly scientifically and
with despatch i kept up a running fire of
voluble discourse springing wastefullv
many of my famous epigrams and brilliant
quips at the same time keeping an ear
cocked for war news from within

  all i heard was a muffled command or
two some clatter and the tinkle of an oil
can or something falling off the table and
then honk called affably

  well what are you fellows waiting for
arent you going to get in on this

   coming i said and in we bustled
hinton first honk had his prisoner trussed
up in a chair as neatly as if he had been
tied on a wager while he was leaning
against the table where our electric reading-
lamp glowed brightly with his redoubtable
revolver poised in readiness and a good-
humored grin overspreading his cheery
countenance

   stick up those unwashed paws of yours
a minute henry he directed  horace
tap his pockets lightly for a chance weap-
on will you no gun or knife on him
good sit down henry and behave your-
self

  the surprised and speechless truck-farm-
er did as honk directed our other captive
stared in a dumb amazement no less pro-
nounced

  now said honk easily mr tee-
garten so-called your harvest days are
over that last pleasant lake montana
deal was the blow that killed father what
we intend to ascertain just at this juncture
is whereabouts did you put that satchel
full of spoil speak up you old buccaneer
wheres the dough  

   whats this crazy mark here talkin
about the five-foot-eight man asked me
huskily in the stress of the moment he
looked almost forty years of age to me

   oh were on kiddo i said no use
quibbling it wont go with us we know
you stuck up the pleasant lake depot and
weve got you faded its all off

  me stuck up the what depot say
whats the joke fellers

  thats what it is hinton chipped in
relieved  theyre trvin to play a joke on
us zeke

  horace said honk you slip over
the way and get that dodger well compare
this brigand with his description im satis-


the railroad mans magazine

fied hes the crook were after but well
have to convince him it seems

  when i returned honk catechized the
prisoner how tall are you he began

   what the- a little revolver play
and- five feet n eight inches i reckon
sullenly

  how old are you

  thutty-five

  what color hair

   say whatn thunder you-

   stocky build honk read aloud  yes
he might be called stocky built but say
-wait a minute horace  honk seemed
to be losing some of his assurance  what
about this scar business over the right eye
hes short a scar over his right eye whatll
we do about that  

  i can hack one in a second i said
wheres my little ax

  honk wavered and then began to back-
fire

   i guess its a horse on us he said
 cut him loose while i get out the jug and
tin cup horace teegarten old-timer this
is a simple case of mistaken identity deep-
ly as i regret it youre not the man we want
pour yourself a snifter

  lemme see that paper our ex-captive
requested it undoubtedly interested him

  five thousand dollars reward he
ejaculated  how many years in the pen
do you spose theyd give the feller if they
was to catch him now

   that would depend on the judge said
honk  maybe two years maybe ten may-
be twenty-five why

   i was just a-thinkin returned tee-
garten  i wouldnt mind to serve two or
three year fer half of that there reward
of course i aint the man but that wouldnt
matter i could make out that i was but
excuse me they might give me twenty-five
 you ought to have twenty-five honk
declared  any man that proposes to
serve a term in prison for half the reward
is a swindler its mighty lucky for you you
havent got that scar over your eye-aw
scat get out i dont like your looks
just a minute i interposed ive
got a curiosity to know what it was you
fellows were talking about when we came
up over there awhile ago some kind of a
dangerous occupation i believe

  coal minin said hinton promptly
zeke here wanted me to quit truck-farm-
in and go to minin

  with that we closed the interview our

guests left taking with them four generous
drinks from our best jug for which we had
received absolutely nothing in return-not
even entertainment

   so much for that said honk  charge
up four drinks to the p  l account
anyhow it was a neat capture i said
ingratiatingly  slick as a greased eel
youre there with the claw-hammer and
alligator-wrench clutch if we only find -the
right man

  he grunted something and went to bed
  and what do you think

  the right man came all right look-
ing at it from the viewpoint of a booky
there was about one chance out of a million
for the man to actually come to valhalla
but that one chance turned out to be a safe
bet

  two or three days after the teegarten
incident honk and i were inside our little
grating pretending to be busy it was an
hour or so before the motor-car was due
to leave for millardsville somebody came
into the waiting-room and approached the
ticket-wicket after the proper amount of
time had elapsed to preserve professional
dignity i looked up one mustnt be too
prompt it looks like they were scared of
their job

  a dark and gloomy face was peering at
me no no im rattled i dont mean that
the face was peering at me i mean that
the man was peering at me with his f-no
not that either anyhow i took a second
look to make sure i wasnt covered with a
revolver gee but that face was a hard
looker to fasten on the front of anybodys
cranium then i noticed the scar above the
right eye five feet eight and age about-
 wot time does this yer car leave for
north rumbled a hoarse voice ominously

   honk i said information then
i added a warning s-st which in our
order same as geese snakes and other flora
and fauna means wake up look out and
beware theres something doing 

  honk hopped up with alacrity

  train for millardsville leaves at nifie-
tliirty he said where to please

   i want to send this yer grip to kansas
city kin i send it by express

  sure thing whats in it

  wot you want to know that for sus-
piciously

  have to know to tell the rate honk
toyed with a paper-cutter while the fellow
deliberated
getting easy money



   ore samples the man said finally
honk dashed off the way-bills entered a
nominal valuation and scratched his head
but did not collect the fee

   ill have to verify that rate by wire
he told the man  you come in in half an
hour and pay the charges and shell go on
the next train

  our friend with the scar shuffled out he

silver money included to make a pretty hefty
package

   aha  said honk i  aha-ed  a few
times myself honk continued briskly

  when this lad comes back well have
him come around behind to sign the book
or for some pretext or other and then well
nab him take no chances he looks
husky if necessary crack him over the

i belted mr cusser a good one
athwart the medulla
oblongata

didnt have on a black slouch hat neither
did he have a rain-coat but my leff palm
was doing some tall itching just the same

  quick  said honk lets see whats
in this gimme a piece of wire ill pick
this lock before you can say whats
trumps- 

  there were a few clicks and squeaks and
some seconds of suspense and then-the
grip was open

  yes it had ore samples in it all right-
not it had express money orders and pack-
ages of currency and rolls of gold coin in
original sealed wrappers with enough loose

bobbin with a stool or the stove poker or
anything handy

  we hadnt long to wait our man re-
turned promptly at the time agreed honk
invited him to come inside our scantum
scantorum and he came its a wonder he
didnt come with a gun in each hand and
stick us up in regulation style but i guess
it wasnt his working day honk supplied
a pen and showed him where to sign at
that moment we pounced

  did you ever fall down a flight of steps
in company with a cook-stove filled with
fire a bee-hive in working order a bunch


the railroad mans magazine

or two of bananas and a spool of barbed
wire with the end loose if you did you
can sympathize with honk and me we
undoubtedly started something when we
pounced

  that fellow was a bucking buzz-saw if

i	had ever got in reach of him hed have
suffered severe punishment but he invari-
ably hit or kicked me or both before i could
close in and use my terrible infield punch

  honk got fastened to the guy somehow
and when he could have let loose wouldnt
later when he would have most gladly he
couldnt and the fellow cussed without
pause real hateful throughout the fight
that was what aroused my ire

  to be kicked in the stomach and given
a knuckle-wrist-elbow swipe simultaneously
is annoying but when your assailant-or
lets see was he the assailant-well when
the kieker and swiper before mentioned
calls you a whang-blam-boom-zip blank-
ety-blank little sausage along with it ones
soul rebels

  so i rose up from my corner clasping a
section of inch galvanized-iron pipe some
seven feet long and danced across and belt-
ed mr cusser a good one athwart the medul-
la oblongata

  honk wrenched his throat out of the
clutch of the fellows twitching fingers and
we laid the geezer out on the floor with his
hands and feet tied and the ropes spiked
fast when he woke up from his nap we
kept away from him too

  but that belt i gave him with the gas-
pipe stopped his saw-mill he was very
quiet and well-behaved and made no more
comments of a personal nature

  we had wrecked the office and as a con-
flict always attracts the idle and the curious
soon the depot windows were clogged with
sightseers it became noised about that we
had raptured a desperado and valhalla rang
with the stirring tale of our bravery and
reckless daring

  once or twice i noticed the haunting eyes
of zeke teegarten green with a dash of
yellow in them watching us from the out-
skirts of the crowd he looked envious i

suppose he felt that hed been cheated out of
twenty-five hundred dollars by the rottenest
kind of a fluke

   as soon as we could get em word a whole
flock of officers came to get our brigand
yes he was the right man and hed been
caught with the goods it was a great catch
they all said so and our five thousand was
paid over promptly without a whimper
we heard that the fellow got fifty years as
the direct result of his visit to valhalla

  five thousand dollars in one gloojous
joyful wad think of it we spread it
out on the table in the medicine house
while the phonograph played since ive
got money in the bank and  shine lit-
tle glow worm shine

  valhalla came down to rubber at it
through the windows and to admire and
point the finger of pride at honk and me
toward evening of that delirious day i had
one lucid moment

    say i said  lets get this bunch of
dough up to the bank before it closes

  tut tut said honk whats the
use of hiding it in a gloomy bank well
keep it here in the car where we can see
hear and handle it it has such a cheerful
crackle to it besides nobody could steal
it while were here huh-nuh i guess
not 

   the rest alas can be told in a few words
alls me heigh ho it was nearly noon
when we awoke the following day our
heads felt as big as the pumpkins they
really were the sweet oily odor of chloro-
form hung in the air of the tightly shut car
and our five tlious yes it was gone
and the thieves left  clue-except a few
lioof-marks a bandanna handkerchief wed
seen in the possession of zeke teegarten
and hen hintons pipe lying beside the
empty jug on our table

  we traced them to the mexico line or
more explicitly el paso at that point we
learned of a certain game of chance or haz-
ard in which one velvet-fingered martin
had participated under the circumstances
the least we could do was to abandon the
chase
 helping em over the hill

by charles frederic

heavy grades are the bane of railroad men besides furnishing many
brain-racking problems for civil engineers and construction bosses the
tallow-pot always has to work harder the eagle-eye has more to worry
about and a thousand and one things are apt to happen to keep a train-crew in
hot water that could never occur on a level track

    but before the mallet compounds and the small-wheeled mountain-climbing
hogs came into use things were a good deal worse than they are now and
hundreds of inventors put in all their spare time trying to find a way to keep
the peanut-roasters of those days from getting stalled on the steep curves and
burning holes in their tires

    instead of planning heavier and more powerful engines however many of
these early locomotive designers seemed to have been convinced that if they
could only get a hard enough grip on the rails the weakest sort of an en-
gine could pull a full-sized train up anything that was not an absolute precipice

freak devices and strange schemes of early-day inventors concocted
to make hill-climbing easy found their way one
by one to the scrap-heap

f you wanted to build a railroad
  and there was a mountain right
  in your way what would you
  do about it

    out west that might not
be regarded as very much of a
conundrum there when a mountain
doesnt get out of the way so much the
worse for the mountain for the railroad
builders run right over it without compunc-
tion or remorse nevertheless this same
problem has caused many men lots of sleep-
less nights not to mention patent - office
fees expenses for stationery and models
and time without limit

   for twenty years after trevithicks first
engine was built everybody was certain that
the locomotive would never be able to move
even its own weight on level ground to
help the poor thing out blenkinsopp pro-
vided it with cog-wheels in  while
bruntou improved upon this by substitu-

   ting legs in imitation of those of a horse in


  after it had demonstrated its ability to
haul a goodly load in addition to its own
weight the knowing ones compromised on a
certainty that the locomotive could never
run up-hill afterward this was amend-
ed so as to limit the climbing capacity of
the locomotive to a grade of forty feet to
the mile

  but if railroads had been limited to a
grade of forty feet to the mile their field
of usefulness would have been so narrow
that they would have been practically value-
less perceiving this a host of inventors
has sought in every way but the right one
to help the locomotive out their efforts
form a most singular chapter in the history
of the railroad

the earliest and most persistent device
upon which many a fantastic variation has
been embroidered is the center rail not


s

the railroad mans magazine

a rack rail but just a plain rail by which
the locomotive was to pull itself up by ad-
hesion instead of by cog-wheels

  the first inventors to appear on the
rcene with a center-rail locomotive were
vignoles and ericsson whose british pat-
ent no  was dated september 
 charles vignoles was one of the
earliest railroad engineers who laid tracks
in austria prussia and russia and be-
sides being a pioneer railroad builder in
south america

  he was the inventor of the t-rail which
was long known as the vignoles rail
he was president of the institute of civil
engineers the foremost engineering society
in great britain in  a fact which in-
dicates his professional standing

  the vignoles and ericsson engine was
to have two horizontal driving-wheels in
addition to the usual vertical ones to be
used only in hill climbing one horizontal
wheel was larger than the other and was
worked by bevel-gear from the axle of the
ordinary driving - wheel which could be
thrown into gear on reaching the hill and
out again after getting to the top the
smaller horizontal wheel was to be pressed
against a smooth center rail by a lever con-
trolled by the engineer

a locomotive with a grip

  henry pinkus improved upon the origi-
nal device with a contraption for which he
obtained british patent no  dated
october   both horizontal wheels
in the pinkus attachment were of equal
size both were carried on the ends of
bent levers crossed like a pair of shears the
pivot being in the vertical plane of the cen-
ter rail

  the long ends of the levers were con-
nected by a screw with right and left hand
threads which was tightened by a ratchet-
wheel and lever talk about adhesion
pinku- had adhesion to burn with the
terrible leverage of his ratchet and screw
he could pinch that center rail until it
shrieked in agony an earthquake could
not have shaken a pinkus locomotive loose
from its prey

  next in chronological order comes an
american inventor george eschol sellers
whose  improvements in locomotive en-
gines  were given to the world from cin-
cinnati in  whether mark twain
had this inventor in mind when he created

  the immortal character of colonel mulberry
sellers may never be known but there is a
tradition that mark twains colonel sellers
was originally christened eschol mul-
berry being substituted before the manu-
script was given to the printer

  george eschol sellers was the son of cole-
man sellers one of the earliest locomotive
builders at philadelphia he died in
 leaving his machine-shops at which
locomotives were built to his sons george
and charles the sellers boys built sev-
eral engines for the pennsylvania state
railroads before george gave it up and
went west to improve the railroads

  by  locomotives in some instances
had reached the prodigious weight of thirty
tons and more in a long and elaborate
treatise sellers pointed out that the con-
sequences of running such enormous
weights at high velocities over the level parts
of the road are ruinous in the highest de-
gree to the rails and superstructure of the
road

engines upon engines

  sellers proposed to avoid all the expense
and vexation of railroads by building them
as cheaply as possible instead of heavy
grading he would lay his railroad on the
surface of the ground with as little prepara-
tion as possible he would also use wood-
en rails this would bring the cost of rail-
roading within the reach of all

  of course heavy locomotives could not
be used on such a road but then he didnt
want heavy locomotives on the contrary
he would build them as light as possible so
that they could run at the highest speed over
the flimsy track without injury to it or to
tire machine the only difficulty would be
in getting over the hills and he was ready
with a device to obviate this lone drawback

  he would have a third rail in the center
of the track on the hills which was to be
gripped by two horizontal driving-wheels
driven through bevel-gear by a separate pair
of engines placed beside the smoke-box over
the ordinary engines in order to get ad-
hesion the horizontal drivers were connect-
ed by a toggle-joint to which the train was
hitched so that its whole weight hung on
the horizontal drivers in going up-hill

  the center rail was also to serve as part
of a brake that was certainly effective in
theory the brake was an arrangement
like a pair of ice-tongs which was suspend-
helping em over the hill



ed over the center rail by triggers when
necessary to apply the brake or rather the
anchor you touched off the trigger the ice-
tongs grabbed the rail and there you were

  there can be no doubt that the sellers
locomotive created something of a sensa-
tion when a model thereof was exhibited in
new york in the autumn of  it was
enthusiastically approved by the american
railroad journal and some of the very
foremost railroad men of the day actually
wrote letters indorsing the device

disaster in spite of followers

  among them were horatio allen who
ran the stourbridge lion the-first locomo-
tive that ever turned a wheel on american
soil who built the charleston and hamburg
railroad who played an important part in
introducing the locomotive and who in
 was consulting engineer of the erie
railroad john b jervis and b h la-
trobe both among the very foremost of early
railroad engineers c e hudson and
john brandt a superintendent of motive
power of the erie were also among those
who thought sellers had made a great dis-
covery small wonder if under the cir-
cumstances sellers could see millions in it

  the millions seemed just on the point of
materializing but they vanished before the
inventors outstretched hands could grasp
them in  the board of directors of
the panama railroad instructed john c
trautwine then chief engineer and ho-
ratio allen to make tests with the sellers
model and report their report being un-
qualifiedly favorable two engines were or-
dered but the panama railroad was des-
tined never to have a center rail

  chief engineer trautwine lost his posi-
tion and colonel totten his successor took
the horizontal drivers extra cylinders and
ice-tongs off the sellers locomotives and re-
duced them to the ignominious necessity of
climbing hills like any other engine traut-
wine who next became chief engineer of
the new york and middle coal field rail-
road in  recommended sellers locomo-
tives for use on grades of one hundred and
fifty feet to the mile

  two engines were built and delivered
but the new york and middle coal field
railroad went bankrupt the engines were
sold and the new owners removed the hori-
zontal drivers and used them as ordinary
locomotives

  while sellers was pursuing his delusion
to its ultimate disaster another american
genius was helping the railroads out with
a variation on the same idea this was
james s french a virginian who was so
plausibly certain he had hit upon the cor-
rect principle for railroads that he actually
induced the legislature of his state to ap-
propriate money in  to build an ex-
perimental track and locomotive after his
plans

  document no  of the session of 
contains the report of the legislative com-
mittee which was appointed to witness the
tests of frenchs experimental railway it
was built on the manchester side of the
river a few hundred yards above the peters-
burg road it was one thousand nine hun-
dred feet long and had a grade of two hun-
dred feet to the mile except for one hundred
feet at the lower end like sellers french
was sure that what the country really need-
ed was flimsy wooden railroads laid on the
surface of the ground which could be built
cheaply

  his scheme to get adhesion was to lay
flat iron bars six inches wide and five-
eighths of an inch thick for rails the
outer edges of these bars projected over the
sill two and one-half inches and as the ends
of the ties were cut off flush with the sills
there was left a free open space for the ad-
hesion wheels

  the driving-wheels were solid the
cranks were on the outer ends of the dri-
ving-axle while between the cranks and the
inner surface of the driving-wheels friction-
wheels were suspended from the axle so
that they revolved under the outer edge of
the rails they could be pressed up by a
compound lever by the engineer and the
axle being the fulcrum the driving-wheels
were pressed down

won praise but not success

  when not in use the friction-wheels
dropped by gravity below the rails a
small steam-cylinder was arranged to throw
the friction-wheels out and above the rails
at crossings and turn-outs the locomotive
weighed three and three-quarter tons and
had cylinders eight by six inches with
the aid of the friction-wheels it took a car
containing a hundred passengers up the hill
at fifteen miles an hour but it couldnt
move without them this led the commit-
tee to report
s

the railroad mans magazine

  the mechanical arrangement is ex-
tremely simple and so far as we can judge
works remarkably well the committee
think that mr french has offered sufficient
evidence of his success toentitle him to the
approbation of the general assembly and to
further encouragement in his efforts to in-
troduce his very ingenious invention into
general use as a native citizen of vir-
ginia his success may well gratify our feel-
ing of state pride and claim for him our
favorable consideration	--

  this was very gratifying yet in spite of
it frenchs railway was never heard of
afterward

the rack railways

  after all these rosy prospects for ameri-
can inventors it remained for an english
engineer j b fell to reap the honor of
building and actually operating the first
adhesion railway it was built in 
on mount cenis and was actually used on
an eight-per-cent grade during the con-
struction of that famous first alpine tunnel
fells railway had the usual smooth rail in
the center of the track

  the engine had two pairs of horizontal
drivers driven by bevel-gear which could
be made to press on the center rail by wedges
actuated by screws fells road was un-
satisfactory and was abandoned after ex-
tensive tests yet it attracted so much atten-
tion that it was tried for a time on a steep
erade on the cantogallo railway in brazil
and also on a steep grade in new zealand

  it really performed a great service how-
ever for its failure led riggenbach to in-
vent die first rack road which was the vitz-
nau-righi railway with grades of twen-
ty-five per cent built in  to-day
there are eight hundred miles of rack rail-
way in operation in the world

  in spite of its conspicuous failures and
obvious impracticability the center-rail ad-
hesion idea dies hard in  h l van
zite a young civil engineer of albany new
york again patented the venerable idea
finally as recently as  m claret a
french engineer actually built a center-
rail adhesion railway from clermont-
ferrand to the summit of the iuy de dome
three thousand one hundred jfeet above the
town

  m claret convinced the directors that
neither a rack-rail nor a funicular as for-
eigners persist in calling a cable road for

some reason not explained was practicable
therefore they adopted the center rail the
road is nine and a quarter miles long with
eight per cent grades part of the way the
gage is one meter the center rail which
is double-headed and weighs fifty-four
pounds to the yard is mounted on brackets
seven inches above the level of the track

  it is gripped by horizontal driving-wheels
two feet eight and a half inches in diameter
at both ends of the locomotive driven by a
chain from the driving-axle and bevel-gear
the pressure on the horizontal rail which
may be anything up to fifty tons is regu-
lated by air the locomotive weighs twen-
ty-eight tons

  thus after a checkered career of three-
quarters of a century the center rail at
length has had a chance to vindicate itself
it is still in operation and if it holds on
for a few years more may earn a sum equal
to the amount squandered in patent fees
on the idea

  after all though the center rail is lack-
ing in picturesqueness also it is defi-
cient in action for an original scheme for
getting over the hills and one which always
gave the stockholders and the spectators the
worth of their money henry handysides
scheme was much superior

  henry handyside was an englishman
who undertook to find the only true way of
getting a train up-hill he did it too he
organized the handyside steep- gardient
company to build his locomotives the
london and northwestern railway of eng-
land was the come-on

it wound up its train

  two of the handyside locomotives were
built and were operated for a short time in
 on the hopton incline of the crom-
ford and high peak branch of the london
and northwestern which had a quarter of
a mile of seven-per-cent grade

  handysides locomotives were english
saddle-tank affairs weighing twenty-two
tons with three pairs of drivers and cylin-
ders thirteen by twenty inches the novel-
ty consisted in a pair of winding engines
which worked a winding drum on which
was several hundred feet of wire rope back
of the fire-box and an anchor consisting of
a steam-cylinder coupled to a rock-shaft on
which were arms that reached down and
gripped the tops and sides of both rails
this clutch was connected to the engine
helping em over the hill



frame fore and aft so that it could not
slip

  when the train came to the bottom of the
hill the engine was uncoupled the loose
end of the wire rope was hooked into the
draw-bar of the head car and then the en-
gine started off up the hill alone paying out
the rope as it went when the rope was
all out the engine anchored by jamming the
clutches down on the rails and the engineer
started the winding-engines which hauled
the train up hand over hand so to speak

  when the train had been brought up it
was anchored and the engine proceeded up
the hill another cable length and repeated
the process as before the average time up-
hill including all stops being two miles
per hour london engineering one of the
greatest english technical periodicals was
deeply interested in this performance but
avoided committing itself either way this
was in 

  if handyside and george l vose of
augusta georgia could only have got to-
gether they undoubtedly could have pro-
duced a locomotive that would really have
been worth while-one that could not only
have climbed all the hills that could be
brought to them but could also have got
over level ground vose wrote a booklet
in s to tell railroad builders how to
speed up the trains he was not worrying
about grades

-two engines in one

  voses locomotive as planned by the in-
ventor was to consist of two ordinary lo-
comotives built smoke-box to smoke-box
the drivers placed in the center of this ar-
rangement were to be eleven feet four inches
in diameter and were to be without flanges
thus according to the inventor  the pas-
sage of curves is perfectly easy there
were to be four cylinders sixteen by twenty-
four inches one on each side of both fire-
boxes the engines were to exhaust into the
open air because the steam would require
too early a release to act with sufficient force
for effective blast after so long a passage

  probably the firemen were to help out
the draft with their breath or by fanning the
fire with their hats they could have done
it easily enough for there were to be two
firemen and two engineers on each of these
siamese twins if they kept her hot vose
thought there would be no difficult- in run-
ning a hundred miles an hour

  both vose and handyside were outdone
by a genius who appeared on the scene
much later-as recently as - in
fact railroad men who have got thirty
days to go a fishing for the indiscretion of
sliding wheels will find no little consola-
tion in the discovery that in adding those
flat spots they were doing just what was
needed c e swinerton of new york
was the first to discover that the cause of all
the trouble with locomotives was that their
wheels were round

an advocate of flat wheels

  to overcome this he patented the polyg-
onal driving-wheel which as he described
it was  formed by cutting a large number
of facets or flat places on the tread con-
nected by very obtuse angles so that- when
the wheel passes over the rail an inch or
more is successively presented in actual con-
tact with the rail thus obtaining far greater
traction than is possible with the cylindrical
wheel which depends for its traction upon
merely a mathematical line a point of con-
tact so slight that scientific works state that
if the contact of locomotive driving-wheels
was any less than at present locomotion by
railway trains would be impossible

  the most amazing thing about swiner-
tons polygonal wheel was that it was thor-
oughly -tried out no fewer than four loco-
motives equipped with it being tried in regu-
lar service on the boston and maine will-
iam smith superintendent of motive-power
and machinery on the boston and maine
asserted over his signature that the locomo-
tive  onward equipped with the polyg-
onal drivers had hauled the portland ex-
press which consisted of six to eight cars
and which made a run of  miles inclu-
ding fifteen stops in four hours from jan-
uary  to july   giving good satis-
faction and made her time

  then the  onward  started on a trium-
phal tour to convince the railroad world that
wheels should not be round but got no far-
ther onward than the jersey central where
in february  it achieved a brilliant
failure

  polygonal wheels were tried on engine no
 on the manhattan elevated road but the
engineering news which had no use for the
polygonal wheel naively alleged that it made
a great deal of noise a statement which
will probably be accepted by most folk
without an affidavit to that effect
s

the railroad mans magazine

  at the very time that swinerton was dem-
onstrating that wheels should not be round
e moody boynton was still further im-
proving the locomotive by amputating most
of its wheels his famous bicycle locomo-
tives built in sss-ss had just three
wheels and  more all being designed to
run on a single rail

  boyntons scheme was the usual mono-
rail that is it had three rails two of them
being sixteen feet up in the air to balance
the locomotive  the other rail which was
on the ground the standard railroad of
to-day is just as much a monorail as the
crankiest scheme ever devised if you forget
to count half the rails

   boj-ntons first locomotive weighed eight
tons it never ran anywhere but it so
pleased the builder that he at once built a
second one weighing twenty-two tons it
had one lonely driver eight feet in diameter
under the center of the boiler which had a
recess built in it a sort of wheel-house to
receive it

  the other two wheels were placed tan-
dem under the tank which was on the same
frame as the boiler the cylinders were
 by  inches the locomotive was 
feet  inches long  feet  inches wide
and  feet  inches from the rail to the
top of the stack brackets on top carried
guide - wheels running between the two
guide-rails

eliminated friction

  boynton accomplished the remarkable
feat of totally eliminating friction-at least
so he said moreover his bicycle rail-
road could be built at one-third the cost of
the ordinary railroad its trains weighed
one-fifth as much as standard trainshaul-
ing the same number of passengers be-
sides it could be built right over mountain
tops and alongside cliffs on brackets fixed
to the wall

  finally one hundred miles an hour would
be just an ordinary speed for it think of
it a hundred miles an hour on brackets
on a canon wall no wonder boynton fig-
ured out that his royalties at one mill per
passenger or per ton per mile would amount
to  per year

   but of all the railroad schemes that ever
have been proposed the most startlingly
original was the one which the scientific
american described as follows in 

   it is a quick and feasible method of

ascending elevations - cheap safe and
worthy the investigation of our scientific
men and capitalists

a one-balloon-power road

  this cheap safe and feasible method
was embodied in  the american mountain
railroad patented by dr joseph auguste
fontaine and described by him in a book-
let penned by his own ingenious hand

  briefly the american mountain railroad
consisted of four lines of cylindrical iron
rails supported from brackets on two lines
of wooden posts considerably higher than
telegraph poles spaced about fifteen feet
apart between these rails ran a wooden
platform high enough above the ground to
allow a car to be swung beneath grooved
wheels above and below the platform en-
gaged the upper and lower rails

  to the platform was to be hitched a bal-
loon when the car was loaded all you
had to do was to unhitch the balloon
and away you went the upper wheels of
the platform trundling serenely along the
upper rails preventing the balloon from
getting too gay on reaching the summit
a windlass was hitched to the outfit which
was then snaked over to the beginning of
the down grade there water was pumped
from a reservoir  the hill-top into a tank
in the bottom of the car until gravity over-
came the buoyancy of the balloon and down
you went

   science teaches and experience shows
wrote dr fontaine that a very small
buoyancy ten pounds is sufficient to gen-
erate the ascent of a very huge balloon with
a high rate of speed and also that a very
little weight is sufficient to generate its de-
scent a superficial inspection might lead
to belief that the balloons of the elevators
can be easily inclined by the winds in the
opposite direction to that from whence they
blow it is not so the pressures from the
winds are counterbalanced by the weight of
the cars

  apparently the scientific men and cap-
italists did not agree with dr fontaine
for the american mountain railroad was
never built indeed if the discouraging
truth must be told notwithstanding all the
efforts of genius to simplify the operation
the only method of getting trains over the
hill that seems to be known in this so-called
enlightened age is to hitch engines to them
and snake them over by main strength

 magazine a monthly publication issued in the
 interest of the i c men they are a loyal set
 proud of their line and filled with the proper
 enthusiasm we take pleasure in reprinting here
 part of a short article that appeared in the octo-
 ber  i c magazine by a l chapin en-
 titled  dont knock-boost  

   one continually meets men with a chronic kick
 because the other fellow has something better or
 is having an easier time when if the truth were
 known the fact that the other fellow is living
 easier is due to the absence of the perpetual
 grouch and the continual nursing of the grouch
 as a hobby

   if the grouch would pull himself together and
 take an optimistic view of things in general he
 would realize that he is much better off than a large
 majority of people life is what we make it and
 the  man above  is hardly inclined to boost when
 your inclinations are to knock growl or grumble

   be not afraid that you will do more than your
 share and be ever ready to help the other fellow
 -you may need help sometimes yourself do the
 best you can at all times and at any old  lace

   at this particular time of adverse legislation
 against railroad companies if all employees would
 take a hand in the fight to overcome the general
 sentiment of rate curtailing etc things would
 soon change and the other fellow would sit up
 and take notice dont be afraid to  put in your
 little oars for the company which treats you
 right and needs your help

   one hears men say  i wouldnt do that youre
 not paid for it such employees should be drop-
 ped from the pay-roll forthwith as they not only
 retard the work of their fellows but put a stone in
 the path of the man who would serve his em-
 ployer conscientiously if left alone

   a man can do more harm in continually growl-
 ing about his position his superior or his pay
 than by adopting the alternative if things dont
 suit grit your teeth your silence will have a
 greater tendency to make matters right than will
 your growls

   get in and boost and if you cannot boost
 dont knock we are all treated right and
 better than the average working man in that we
 are put upon our honor and expected to perform
 an honest days work for fair pay

   when you hear an outsider finding fault with
 the railroad remember he is talking about your
 employer and if you do not think you can dis-
 suade him from his way of thinking do not take
 sides with him let the world know if necessary
 that you are proud to be a railroad man

winning a widow

                  by frank condon

               is it lucky for fireman and engineer to travel
               together when they love the same woman

here was once a widow in
chicago there are still
widows in chicago - hand-
some dashing buxom wid-
ows-with eyes like the stars
and a fund of miscellaneous
information concerning the opposite sex that
would make an encyclopedia look puny
there will always be widows in the city on
the edge of the inland sea but if you hap-
pened to be connected with the operating de-
partment of the genesee central railroad
and knew die facts as you certainly would
know them you would instantly recall the
widow

  her name was marie which is one of
the most appropriate names a widow can
have she had a final name but it doesnt
matter now-it is her name no longer

  when judson took the throttle of the
eastern limited he sent in an immediate
requisition the burden of which was that
unless orourke were made his fireman
life would be a dull drab thing the gen-
esee central people looked over orourkes
record and found that he had been firing
freight-trains in a thoroughly patient man-
ner for three years and that there was no
particular reason why he should not be ap-
pointed fireman on the eastern limited
so orourke got the job and judson de-
manded thanks

   i dont see any particular advantage in
this new job said orourke ungraciously
 ill have to work a little harder on this

old wreck you run thats all if youd
have let me alone id still be sleeping peace-
fully on the coal and iron special

  you have no ambition retorted jud-
son  i am directly responsible for this
promotion and if you work hard youll be
elected some day to handle a throttle

  all right son responded orourke
 much obliged for the new job as a mat-
ter of fact you had me appointed because
you need an intelligent human being in
the cab with you most of the rummies who
have fired for you wouldnt know the differ-
ence between locomotive firing and locomo-
tor ataxia

  orourke was twenty-nine and judson
had slipped along to thirty-seven they
had known each other for fifteen years
eaten out of the same chowder bowl slept
in the same bunk worn the same clothes
smoked the same pipe and loved the same
women

  they admired each others good qualities
in secret and openly criticized each others
weaknesses as often as the exigencies of
the business permitted they hunted each
other up and consequently they were the
best friends in the world and continued to
be such until-until the coming of the
widow marie

  this happened months after orourke
began firing for judson almost from the
very first the widow marie brought a bale-
ful influence into two hitherto peaceful ex-
istences
winning

  judson met her at the annual ball after
he had danced with her until the matter
became public scandal he escorted her to
an expensive food hangar and spent an
amount of money buying her choice viands
that would have driven his old mother fran-
tic had she known

  then as a matter of course he introduced
orourke from that vital moment the
forces of trouble began to gird on their
armor

  orourke discovered the cause before
judson he was standing before the gage
of the big atlantic when it occurred to him
that a little conversation might help matters
along

   thre is no sense in it he said shortly
looking up at judson who was staring
glumly out of the cab window

   there is no sense in what   replied
the engineer without moving

   in the way youve been acting lately
youd think i had suddenly murdered your
entire family by the way youve been treat-
ing me what you need is to have some
large -brawny individual come along and
hand you a tunk on the cabeeza

   i dont know what youre talking
about replied judson coldly

   im talking about marie said
orourke

   what about her  

  nothing except that you think ive cut
in on your preserves thats all i will admit
that ive tried to be pleasant to the lady
ive called at her home and she is certainly
one swell little widow i have seen some
very dapper widows in my time but this
one leads the army but the idea of your
getting sour thoughts-my my my

  i dont think i care to talk about this
matter just drop it said judson climb-
ing down from his seat  if youll keep
the steam up about twelve pounds well be
pulling out soon

  they dragged the eastern limited
through illinois and indiana that evening
without indulging in unnecessary conversa-
tion other evenings followed all similar
and the breach between the erstwhile good
friends began to acquire an appearance
of permanency

  the widow marie went calmly on her
way judson had long since passed the last
stage of complete sanity where she was the
question and orourke took an added in-
terest in her because of judsons hostile at-
titude

a widow		

  he visited her as often as he was per-
mitted and spent ridiculous portions of his
salary buying her gifts friends of judson
said things that in no way contributed to his
peace of mind

  on the night of the th of september
the heat sizzled and eddied through the
roundhouse in a cab it was almost un-
bearable and judson climbed up the ladder
in a temper that needed one harsh word-
just one harsh word and then devastation
and death

  orourke was late for the first time
since his appointment to the eastern lim-
ited the fireman was behind time and jud-
son puttered about the cab thinking of ap-
propriate remarks

  the excessive heat had acted directly on
orourkes disposition and he was boiling
in several places when he hurried through
the yards to his engine oddly enough
judson said nothing neither did
orourke

  they jolted the atlantic out through the
yards and down the side-track to await the
arrival of the limited from the west any
close student of human nature could per-
ceive at once that a cyclone was slowly
gathering in the cab judson poured oil
into the monster of steel and steam
orourke busied himself in the cab and
occasionally cast an idle glance towards the
passenger gates where the usual hurrying
nervous petulant mob waited for the lim-
ited

  she came in twenty minutes late the
engineer and fireman had not spoken a word
to each other and it was at scarsdale that
the storm broke in the comparative silence
of the cab judson looked across at
orourke through a wispy eddy of steam
and remarked

   youre a cur arent you  

  at first the fireman simply stared across
the boiler-head in mute amazement then
the full force of the question struck him
and his bronzed face flushed

  what did you say he asked quietly
looking intently at judson

   i said vou were a cur

  meaning what continued orourke
still more quietly his fingers were trem-
bling over the wrench in his lap

   i mean that and nothing else you
think that i dont know what youve been
doing and what youve been saying about
me to-to her you think that youve been
a sly clever dog and that youve pulled the
the railroad mans magazine

wool over my eyes that i dont know how
youve been telling lies to her about me and
how youve been knocking me just because
you want to win her yourself

  ive always thought youd play fair no
matter what happened between you and me
and now i find you out ive got friends
otherwise i dont suppose id ever have
found out what a mean pup you are

  if you mean all youve just said re-
plied orourke rising to his feet and drop-
ping to the floor of the cab youre a liar

   judson half rose with rage glaring in his
eyes the shrill squeal of the air-whistle
halted him midway and he sank back me-
chanically the throttle came out under his
firm pull and the eastern limited grunted
and bucked as it gathered headway

  i said you were a liar bellowed
orourke youre a chump to believe
what you heard-but you wanted to believe
it who introduced me to that woman
you did

  judson heard him and turned to answer
orourke was glaring up at him angrily
oil-can in hand with the light from the fire-
box throwing flashes in his face for five
minutes they yelled insults at each other-
hot bitter words that escape from a mans
lips when rage has the upper hand jud-
son turned suddenly and leaped from his
seat straight at his fireman

  orourke threw himself aside and caught
judson on his shoulder in the same mo-
ment the engineer swung his fist in half a
circle and the blow fell with a crash upon
orourkes open mouth the fire-box door
clattered back and forth and the blaze
from the furnace below outlined the two
men as they stood in the center of the cab
lunging wickedly at each other

  orourke dropped his oil-can and re-
covered from the impact of the engineers
blow he forgot that he was fighting a
-uperior officer and his heavy fist descended
rocking judsons head the men backed
away from each other poised a moment and
then came together orourke landed a
heavy swing and judson fought him back
madly almost to the tender

  there was no room for fancy fighting in
the cramped space fist crashed against
face neck and stomach for five minutes
the former friends battered each other with
every ounce of strength in their bodies

  the eastern limited twelve loaded pull-
mans slipped along into the night picking
up speed momentarily-a rushing monster

on twin strips of steel at lisbon the
hurtling mass flashed by a red danger lamp
at sixty-five miles an hour three minutes
later the trucks struck the open edge of
a switch and held an instant later the
rushing train smashed into the rear of a
coal train

  the wreck of the atlantic was complete
twelve pullman coaches jammed her snort-
ing hulk deep into the coal-cars with a
final gasp she turned over judson and
orourke went under with the cab

  the wrecking outfit hustled along within
an hour the big crane groaned and
creaked as it tugged at the hot mass of coal-
encrusted metal fifty men leaped forward
as the cab rose and disclosed the uncon-
scious figures of the fireman and engineer
somebody placed a skilful ear to their hearts
and announced that they were still alive

  in the third pullman judson and
orourke were laid out carefully and the
only physician on the train went at them
with sharp steel he found both men badly
battered he noted also with surprise that
both men displayed facial and bodily in-
juries that scarcely could have come to them
in the wreck

  they will live he said

  judson and orourke came back to their
senses almost at the same instant

  the head of each man was supported by
a silk sleeve and the silk sleeve covered the
tapering and shapely arm of a woman

  they looked up painfully as the widow
marie smiled at them

  youll get well she whispered gently
bending low  the physician says so

  judson tried to speak orourke at-
tempted a brief conversation the effort
threw both into their former state of obliv-
ion

  the injured men were hurried to chicago
and placed side by side in a hospital the
nurses worked over them determinedly but
it was more than a day before orourke
opened his eyes again judson lay five feet
off in a peaceful slumber

  what happened orourke asked the
attendant we were wrecked werent
we	

   you ought to be glad youre alive said
the nurse smilingly she was seated at
orourkes side and in her lap lay a morn-
ing newspaper  this is what happened

  she held the open paper before the fire-
mans eyes and he read the account of the
wreck painfully and laboriously half-way
when bill was boss



down the column he ceased reading and
stared uncomprehendingly at a sub-head-
ing which ran  angel of mercy aboard

 -	wrecked-flier

  then he remembered what followed
 assisted him it told of a beautiful woman
 a heroine she had plunged into the worst
 of the wreck she had given the injured men
 every possible aid she had helped the sur-
 geon as he worked over them and she had
 held their battered heads in her arms

  the widow marie orourke mut-
 tered as he read on

   while her husband of a few hours la-
 bored to restore life to the two mangled
 trainmen this beautiful bride etc etc ran
 the article orourke kept his eyes open
 by a violent effort and continued down the
 column

   the widow marie had married the sur-
 geon that morning they were beginning
 their honeymoon fortunately they had

taken the wrecked train and were thus able
to render valuable assistance the sur-
geons name was manners orourke
brushed the paper from him with his un-
bandaged arm and turned to the sleeping
judson

   how soon will he wake up  he asked

   in an hour or two replied the nurse

  are you sure murmured orourke
sleepily

   he should awaken then or a little later

   im pretty tired-pretty tired contin-
ued the fireman but ill wait until he
avvakes will you please look at that news-
paper again and tell me the name of the
doctor who was on his honeymoon with the
beautiful lady who held our heads

   his name was manners replied the
nurse

   manners-manners thank you said
orourke  judson will probably want to
know

when bill was boss

by c y warman

and it came to pass that bill is now the president of a great railroad
and the judge the governor of a great state

fdon after he had emerged from the
dewy dawn of his railway career
bill got a night-trick at detroit
and in a short time was made
trainmaster for he was a steady
worker and one of the best listen-
ers on the west end

  an enterprising traveling passenger-
agent conceived the idea of persuading
some of the people of bay city to circulate
over a part of the grand trunk to visit
detroit and see belle isle bust the river wide
open and told bill of his plan bill lis-
tened wide-eyed to the rosy pipe of the
passenger man and in a few days the latter
went to it scores of people said it was a
good idea and some said theyd go sure

  unfortunately for the affair however it
began raining in the early evening of the
day before and on the morning set for the-
excursion it was still pouring about noon
bill got a wire from the t p a dated du-
rand saying still raining only one ex-
cursionist what shall i do

  bill answered chain the poor boob to
the seat and run him through to detroit
we cant have anything fail on the west
end

  in due time bill became superintendent
and was sent down to a certain city where
the force was all flat-wheeled from being too
long in one place bill had been notified
that the baggage department at the east end
wanted icing and finding it in pretty bad


the railroad mans magazine

 -hape he wired the head of that depart-
 ment   send help quick  the answer
 came  sending thompson

 thompson took his place in the baggage-
 room looking very much like the bulldog
 in the express picture

 next morning one of the excess boys blew
 in and saluted the new baggageman

  here cholly  he called airily
  check me this box to kingston as
 thompson placed the box on the scales the
 other man laughed loudly

  evidently he is new on the job thought
 mr excess

 thatll be a dollar said thompson
 oh i guess not-d h and p d
 said the other with a smile as he shoved his
 hands deep into his sack-coat pockets
 squared his shoulders and turned to leave

 he glanced back but as thompson had
 only rolled the box to one side he came
 back leaned over the low counter and said
 check please

  dollar please said thompson

 say are you trying to be funny
 no said thompson

 know anything about vie

 no

 know anything about anything

   some

  well im goin to report you to the sup
 right now

  hes up-stairs

  dont you give me any lip v
 thompson went on with his work and
 mr excess hit the third step from the floor
 and went up he knew bill by sight and
 pulling up in front of the superintendents
 desk he began to tell his story bill just
 looked and listened when he finished bill
 was still looking and listening

 mr excess thought bill didnt under-
 -tand and started in to tell it all over again
 presently bill asked

 who told you that

 why your new trunk-wrestler

  sure he was the baggageman

 nothin surer-got the literature on his
 headpiece

 and he told vou that

  sure

  well i guess he knows hes the bag-
 gageman

 mr excess went down slowly produced
 a dollar got a receipt and said

  say mr wise guy do you know some-
 thins goin to happen to this jim crow
 jerk-water parody on a railroad

  yes

  yaas im goin to send everything i
sell over the c p after this

   then said thompson  i presume the
grand trunk will stop buying supplies
from black and white

  that made mr excess sit up and think
still he had a little fight left

   its lucky for us you dont do the
buying

  no but ill let em know how you feel
about it

  presently mr excess came back and
said guess well call it off eh

  too late said thompson just
dropped an r r b in the mail

  mr excess became nervous

  thats your train said thompson as
a ticket-taker bellowed  board 

  look here pleaded excess you
stop that report or ill lose my job

   cant stop that

   then send another kill it and youve
got my freight for life heres my hand
 all right said thompson as the tamed
traveler sprang for the last car

  in the course of railway events bill be-
came general manager of a considerable
railroad which had fallen into the hands
of a receiver this latter official was a
judge-lies a governor and presidential
possibility now-and he started out to look
the line over to cheer the live ones and re-
move the dead ones

  when he stepped ashore at detroit he was
somewhat surprised that the g m did not
appear to make him welcome and inci-
dentally to water his own stock personally
presently the judge observed a stout man
looking at him with big frank eyes

  each looked steadily into the eye of the
other for several seconds when the judge
ventured

  youre mr so-and-so-
  yes youre judge blank

   yes

  when they had looked and listened for a
long time the judge side-stepped slowly and
leaned on a fence bill followed and fa-
cing each other again they both said noth-
ing for a spell presently the judge spoke

  well i guess we understand each other
now like to have you stay on the job

    all right said bill

  of course im not mentioning any names
but william is president of the pere mar-
quette now and the judge is the governor
of ohio

the things that happen to the captains of the grip in the days run
are as varied as the lines of goods they carry and as
exciting as some of the stories they tell

mobile with
was just in

 how the railroad paid

here were three of us in the
small smoking compartment
on an afternoon train east-
bound out of asheville north
carolina paxton had covered
his territory as far down as
a line of hats and welling
from the mississippi valley
where he had been showing dress goods

  about the time we were comfortably set-
tled the train slowed up before the little
station at biltmore among the passengers
who came aboard there was a middle-aged
farmer who entered the smoking compart-
ment and took a seat opposite me he was
a seedy individual not only in his dilapi-
dated exterior but in his manner as well
he was a good type of the mountaineer class
of tar-heels of that section

  he didnt wait for the formality of an
introduction but immediately put himself
in communication with any one mutually in-
clined he impressed me as being a man
with a great mental burden who was look-
ing about for a little assistance to help tote
it around

    rr

   i done reckon he said in a tone of
inquiry looking directly at me that you-
all am genelmen from the noth

  we all live in new york i replied
well sah in that case i don min con--
fidin in you-all an trustin to yo honah
not to-

  just here his confidences were rudely in-
terrupted by the appearance of the conduc-
tor in the doorway with his polite request

 tickets gentlemen 

  each of the occupants of the compart-
ment pulled out a mileage book except one
man with a strip ticket and the farmer who
presented the most woful countenance i
have seen o tside of a funeral

  the conductor waited a decent length of
time for the man to produce a ticket and
then said firmly

    ticket please sir

  the man with the woful face had been
looking at his hands which were nervously
clasping and unclasping on his lap when
the conductor spoke he looked up and i
saw tears trickling down his wrinkled face

   please mistah conductor he said half
choked with strong emotion  im a poh
lone man an im in a powful lot of dis-

g


the railroad mans magazine

tress i havent a cent in the world and
my only daughtah is dyin-here he al-
most broke down but he choked back a sob
and continued- an i want to see her
again befo she passes ovah to the othah
shoah please dont put me off mistah
conductor its down at statesville that
she lives it aint very far down thar
well im very sorry for you said the
conductor with a touch of pity  but you
see sir i cant help you out by giving you
a free ride on this train im sorry but
orders are orders and you will have to get
off at the first stop we make which is
marion that is quite a way down the
line and will give you quite a lift on the
trip

   see here conductor said welling who
was much interested in the little scene
thats all right we are all gentlemen
here no one will ever be the wiser if you
let him ride through pass him along and
let him go to his sick daughter

   i havent a doubt but that you are gen-
tlemen all of you the conductor replied
 but ive a tip that there is a ticket auditor
on this train and if he checks me up
after ive done collecting why im going to
be short if i pass this man thats worth as
much as my job no i cant take any such
risk to-day

   well then said welling  ill pay for
his trip what is the fare to statesville
and he pulled out a roll of bills

  oh no you dont not on your life 
the broken-hearted man almost shouted
both the tone of his voice and his diction
had decidedly changed  i wont let any
man do that for me though i thank you
just the same sir

  as he spoke he drew from his inner
coat-pocket a big bill-case packed tight with
yellow boys from which he selected a twen-
ty and paid his fare the conductor after
collecting the fare gave us a look of com-
passion and passed out the door

    gentlemen said the farmer as the con-
ductor slammed the door  i owe you an ex-
planation and an apology for what has just
happened

  all right said paxton giving well-
ing a look that made him feel uncomfort-
able  we are all good listeners fire away
well its this way continued the
would-be free rider passing around a case
full of good cigars  about five years ago
this here railroad killed a mare of mine-
a fine roadster too she was-run over her

in broad daylight before a dozen wit-
nesses

    she got onto the tracks because of a
gap in one of their rotten fences i sued
the company for three hundred dollars but
their cussed lawyers beat me out

   ever since ive been trying to get that
three hundred out of em every way i could
and by hook and crook sometimes one way
and sometimes another ive managed to
beat em out of two hundred and ninety-six
dollars and fifty cents it was the other
three dollars and a half i was trying for
just now i failed this time but ill get
the money yet

when purdy paid up

well said paxton when the man
had finished  i take off my hat to
you for hanging on till you get even how-
ever you havent much on an old friend of
mine for dogged patience in waiting for an
opportunity to even up a score

  there was purdy said paxton i
guess you fellows remember purdy when he
was traveling through the south for a firm
of overall makers

    one trip when he was working ashe-
ville he met another drummer carrying the
same line out of chicago although they
were working the same territory and were
strong competitors they came to be very
fast friends sometimes going so far as to
split up a town between them or working
separate towns in the same territory and
dividing the orders at the end of the week

   some time after their acquaintance
they met in a hotel in raleigh and a few
minutes conversation developed the fact
that both intended to work the same towns
on one of the roads leading out of raleigh
each of them had calculated on working
four towns during the day

    it was summer-time during one of those
hot spells that just about meets a northern
man in the south so when his friend
harris suggested a community of interests
purdy instantly accepted neither was
falling over himself to make those burgs
the scene of a heat-selling contest

   there were seven towns each took
three agreeing to meet at the seventh at
the end of the days work when they
reached it they put up together in the same
room at the hotel

   both men had done a rattling good
days business in the towns he had cov-
told in the smoker



ered but both were fighters and in order
to keep in practise they agreed to fight it
out over the business in the last town the
next morning

  they went to sleep joking about the
hot fight each was going to give the other
on the following day purdy was a very
heavy sleeper and had said that he would
leave a call with the hotel clerk but har-
ris told him that he always woke early
and that he would call purdy when he
arose-so purdy let it go at that

  but harris did not keep his promise
in fact he hadnt intended to when
purdy finally awoke it was after eleven
oclock harris had not only gone but
had locked the door

-	by the time purdy dressed and was
able to get out it was after noon and when
he got down-town he found that harris
had sold every customer in the place and
had taken the limited to raleigh he had
left a note at thehotel for purdy saying
he was sorry that he forgot to call him
and that as he had only a few minutes to
catch his train he wasnt able to drop in
to say good-by which he regretted

   they met several times after that but
neither referred to the incident purdy
was waiting his chance to get even and he
waited nearly six years before the oppor-
tunity came

    they were both working the same ter-
ritory in the southern tier fever was
raging on the gulf coast and a shotgun
quarantine had been established in south-
ern alabama

    when purdy landed in one of the best
towns in that section he learned that har-
ris was to arrive the next day here was
his chance without hesitation he went to
the excited authorities of the place and in-
formed them that he knew of a man who
had been exposed to the fever in southern
mississippi and who had declared his in-
tention of defying quarantine and coming
into town the next morning

  beside giving them harriss name he
furnished them an accurate description of
him and the officials were soon carefully
watching every train that arrived when
harris finally landed he faced a dozen
shotguns in the hands of the local authori-
ties who despite all protests placed him
in the pest-house and kept him there for a
week

    in the meantime purdy was unusually
busy he worked and secured all the busi-

ness in every town in the surrounding sec-
tion before he left he wired harris his
congratulations with a very pointed refer-
ence to old times and an early call harris
thought it was just a bit more than an
even game and he has been gunning for
purdy ever since

the perfidy of the plug
custodian

well sakl welling when paxton
had concluded i hope he lias
better luck than two other fellows and i
had in our attempt to get even for the trick
played  us by a fellow traveler  a trip
over in tennessee a couple of years ago

   we four fell in together in a little town
and ran into a combination of circumstances
that would make a good comic opera

  we stopped at the best hotel but it
was onfi of those slipshod places where
they have four rooms with baths and only
one bath-tub plug when one of us got
ready for a dip he had to call the porter
and have him beg the holder of the precious
plug for a loan of it

   as you can imagine this was pretty
awkward at first but toward the last we
four got together and formed a close or-
ganization which we called the  independ-
ent order of the knights of the plug

   we had a constitution and by-laws
and formulated rules by which we swore
to govern ourselves with regard to this
very desirable and indispensable article
we agreed upon a schedule of hours when
each was to have the plug and the order
in which it was to be rotated among us

  we also placed a time limit  the
period for keeping the plug a system of
fines was established for keeping it over-
time

   the fines thus collected were to be
donated to the hotel management at the
end of our stay together with a pertinent
recommendation that the money be used to
purchase a full supply of plugs for our
next visit

   quite a sum was realized however
and we decided at the last moment to
amend the constitution and spend the money
in a way that would give us pleasanter re-
sults to this end we concluded to give
a banquet for the members of the i o
k p

the funds of the order were turned
over to a committee of one who was to


the railroad mans magazine

arrange for the feast when the time came
for the banquet we waited nd waited about
the door of the place where the spread
was to be served

  the man with the funds had not yet
arrived after the end of an almost in-
terminable time when our patience was
altogether exhausted a messenger came with
a note which read as follows

  fellow members knights of the plug

    i received a telegram this afternoon from
  the house calling me in i had no time to
  communicate with the other members so i
  have taken the afternoon train for chicago
  finding the funds of the organization very
  convenient as expense money also which
  will perhaps be even more reprehensible in
  your sight i took the plug with me i had
  become so attached to it that i just couldnt
  bear to part from it

    so i have gone-plug money and all i
  have no excuse to offer except that i couldnt
  stand to think of you fellows making merry
  at that feed without me and i knew you
  couldnt have the extra eats without the
  price

    forgive me as you hope to be forgiven for
  stopping at a hotel with four bathtubs and
  one plug i dont believe it will be laid up
  against me in the final judgment-that is if
  you fellows ever get a chance at me before
  that time yours brazenly

                custodian of the plug

 well concluded welling reminis-
cently  i guess you can imagine what a
disappointed lot we were it was too late
to get him back and mob him 
at

paxtons hot bath

   ay but you were lucky though to
have a real bath-tub laughed pax-
ton  it isnt every place in the south even
to-day where you can have that the
south has awakened all right and is
booming along but even now in some of
the little back - country towns the hotel
service is about the limit even to a fellow
who knows what it is to rough it

  ill never forget an experience i had
one evening in march down in the wilds of
kentucky i had driven thirty miles that
day over mud roads and i was wet and
chilled clear through arriving at the
hotel which had the outward appearance
of being quite comfortable i inquired if i
could get a hot bath to my delight i
was told that i could

   i went to my room disrobed and

throwing a bath-robe around me i called
the negro porter at his command i fol-
lowed him down the corridor outside a
fine rain half snow and sleet was falling
and a high piercing wind was blowing

   by and by we emerged upon the lat-
ticed back porch on the second story of
the hotel there in a latticework that was
covered with vines in summer stood a bath-
tub into which the negro boy had dumped
a couple of buckets of steaming hot water

  the latticework was all open and the
flaring lamp sizzling as the snow-flakes
struck its hot chimney revealed me to all
the neighbors in the rear of the hotel after
i had sized up the situation i tried to tell
the porter my teeth chattering till they fairly
snapped what i thought of such an arrange-
ment and passed up my bath in as good
order as was possible under the circum-
stances

   well you had the advantage of hot
water anyway said welling thats
something they didnt give me down in
georgia when i asked for a bath after id
come in from a hot days work i told the
proprietor of the little two-by-four hostelry
that i wanted a bath and he turned me over
to the colored boy who led me out to the
wagon-shed

   he told me there was  rangements fo
washin  out there i was piloted to an aban-
doned granary to disrobe after which i was
to step  ovah to th othah end whah th
rangements was

   when i got there i found the boy wait-
ing for me with a line of hose in one hand
and a big palmetto-fiber scrub-brush in the
other ready to turn on the water and give
me a bath together with a regular horse-
currying with that wire-edged brush

  the water in that hydrant was from a
tank filled by a windmill from a well and
cold enough to freeze the marrow in a fel-
lows bones i forswore the bath and also
swore at the  rangements
at

a patent cyclone-cellar

peaking of arrangements contin-
ued welling i had an experience
once that beat anything ive ever run up
against it was in my early days of trav-
eling when i was selling farm-machinery in
western kansas i had struck some queer
hotels but the oddest lay-out of all was
owned and operated by a genius named
sellers and im willing to wager he was
told in the smoker



some relation to old colonel mulberry sellers
his place was in a little village in sheridan
county about eighteen miles from hoxie

   sellers was a queer character his spe-
cialty was invention and he was always
telling of his dreams of that proverbial
million i suppose he had invented more
worthless things than any man almost
everything he made would work but they
all required more time and labor than the
things he had tried to improve

   his barn-lot and his barn as well as his
little one-story hotel were filled with the
things he had invented and i really think
he was only handicapped in his inventing
mania by lack of space to store his creations

  when i first called on him for accom-
modations he put me to bed in a small room
possibly not more than eight by ten feet
with one small window and an extremely
narrow door one peculiarity i noticed as
he showed me into the room was that the
place appeared to have double walls he
had the reputation of being a fine old chap
generally or i would have felt a bit squeam-
ish about occupying the room

   the night was unusually sultry and
close with only one window open at the
top there was little ventilation during the
night i was aroused from a sound sleep by a
creaking jarring and rumbling the first
thought that flashed into my mind was that
a cyclone had struck us with a bound i
leaped out of bed and ran to the window

   as soon as i touched the floor a sick-
ening sensation of falling came over me
everything was as dark as the black hole
in mv excitement i rammed my arm clear
through the window and was dumfounded
to the point of speechlessness when my fist
struck solid earth

  to say that i was terror-stricken isnt
overdrawing it a bit i was on the point
of doing something desperate when with a
sudden jar the movement ceased and we
began to ascend again and then stopped
suddenly

  just as we stopped a gust of wind struck
me through the open window and i was
about to climb out through the opening when
sellers opened the door and asked in a
triumphant tone 

  well how did she work were you
scared mister 

   in no very mild language i demanded
an explanation of what had occurred

   cyclone was his cheerful reply  took
the hoss - barn and two haystacks clean

pulled the windmill up by the roots and
mussed up the best part of town i thought
it was going to hit this shack and so i let
you down

   the next morning he showed me the
mechanism of his arrangement every sleep-
ing-room was as i had surmised a double
room the inside being on the same principle
as an elevator- he had rigged up weights
and counterweights on these elevator-rooms
so that by working a small windlass he
could drop all the sleepers in his hotel down
into the cellar until an approaching cyclone
had passed over

j

 - why he asked

ltrphat reminds me said paxton of
a cyclone i once took part in out in
kansas i was selling windmills and pumps
those days and the hotel accommodations
werent anything to make a boast of in the
territory i was covering

   one night i had to double up with two
cattle-drovers in one dinky little bed and i
thought that was going some but the limit
was reached three days later when i came
to a small town tired out from a long drive
across country and inquired of the only
hotel in the place for quarters over night

   the hotel proprietor said he regretted
exceedingly that he had but one small room
and that was occupied but he hoped i would
not object to doubling up with the occupant
who had already retired

   he lighted me up to the room showed
me the bed put down the light and as he
started to leave he asked casually

     i suppose you have had smallpox 
no i have not had smallpox i re-
plied wondering at the question

  well thats bad he remarked and
added cheerfully as he again turned to the
door  but i suppose it cant be helped

   he was about to close the door when i
called after him

    say what has smallpox got to do with
this deal 

  oh nothing he answered coolly
nothing-only your bedmate has it

   right then is when the cyclone started
it was a double-header the length of he
hall all the way down a flight of stairs
through the cluttered-up little office out
across the porch and into the starry night
finally winding up on the north side of the
horse-barn where it just naturally flickered
out because i was winded

synopsis of previous chapters

herman tillman whose real name is george clifford son of a titled englishman has
earned his fathers displeasure by marrying the daughter of a commoner and has sought seclu-
sion on a small island off the scottish coast here he is traced by his fathers secretary
peter raymond who for his own evil ends leads the villagers to believe that tillman is a murderer
forger and robber an old minister mr moreland who has come from tillmans father is as-
saulted and raymond tries to lay the crime at tillmans door but is himself accused by moreland
the old minister has been instrumental in winning the father over to the extent of providing a
yearly allowance for his son with the proviso that he and his family leave england and settle in
america they are wrecked and in the excitement of manning the life-boats clifford disappears

chapter vi
in an open boat

s	the life-boat in which george
clifford was being lowered
to the sea a block that had
in some way become de-
tached from the rigging
fell and struck him on the
head he was rendered unconscious but
his body in falling struck squarely in the
boat that was being lowered at the time

  several of the excited sailors imagining
that he was killed actually kicked the body
under the seats of the boat for be it known
a life-boat is unusually large and roomy
and its peculiar construction makes it safer
in a heavy sea than an ordinary ship

  it was useless to ply the oars in order to
make any headway all that the sailors
could do was to keep them in the water in
the hope of steadying the boat as much as
possible and wait for the terrible storm to
subside this they did the terrible black-
ness only adding to their horror

  the heavy sea dashed over the boat
drenching the men the able-bodied sea-
man knows how to brace himself against
such an enemy however and when he un-
derstands that the boat if not loaded too
heavily will ride the waves like a cork he
knows that he is perfectly safe

  he is much safc-r in fact than he would

be in a large steamer or sailing vessel for
the great weight of such craft puts them in
the position of a buffer and the waves are
liable to dash them to pieces while the ves-
sel is trying to ride them

  when morning dawned the sea had
somewhat abated and the cliffs of dover
 the maine coast stood sheer and high in
the distance

  though famished and weak the men
plied the oars willingly they estimated
that it would not take more than an hour to
make a landing they knew the coast
well

  they had not paid much attention to
clifford but some time during the night
the terrific onrush of the cold water had
brought him to his senses and he faintly
realized that he was in an open boat at sea

  he thought of his wife and little ones
and prayed that they were as safe as he
at that moment the thought that they
might have perished unnerved him so that
he could not keep his mind at ease

  the position he was forced to occupy in
the boat was more than uncomfortable but
he bore it with fortitude and a kindly sleep
robbed him of further torture

  a few hours after the men had sighted
the dover cliffs clifford awoke the bright
day startled him he sat up rubbed his
head and looked around there he was in
a large open boat five lusty men-some
in oil-skins others with scarcely any cloth-

began in the december railroad mans magazine single copies jo cents


through by sunrise



ing on-were tugging at the oars with all
their strength	

  clifford looked around the air was
crisp and cool the sun was shining bright-
ly and the greenish-blue sea with its suc-
cession of whitecaps somewhat fascinated
him

  his first thought was one of thankful-
ness for his own life as for his wife and
children-if a merciful providence had
taken them from him he would bear up
bravely under the strain and let the terrible
visitation make  better man of him it
would not suffer him to do otherwise he
said to himself he would take it all phil-
osophically

  but we cannot always do what we wish to
do the most

  he looked at the men plying their oars
and they looked at him

  are w safe he asked his voice
trembling with suppressed emotion

  there is land ahead sir said one of
the men  it will not be long before we
pull into shore

   where are we   he asked again
dover cliffs are on our bow sir if i
know my bearings and methinks i do sir
we are not far from devon

  it was awful said clifford recalling
the storm that had separated him perhaps
forever from all on earth that was dear to
him

  a bad storm sir went on the sailor
who was acting as the spokesman

  there was a long pause and then clif-
ford asked

  is this the only boat launched

  we were trying to launch them all when
the full force of the gale struck us sir i
saw one of them cut loose from the davits
and swamp said the spokesman  i have
been in a good many blows sir but that
was the worst-the most sudden

  clifford pulled himself up into a seat
alongside one of the men

  eagerly he scanned the now placidly
beautiful water-but there was no other boat
to be seen

   i have seen no boat sir went on the
sailor as if anticipating what was in the
mind of the searcher when we got
away i pulled in the direction of the shore
it was very hard to discern anything but
i do not think that the old hulk stayed an
top long after this boat-load got away
my god clifford hid his eyes for a
moment

    i wouldnt be surprised if this were the
only boat-load saved

  the words cut clifford to the-heart the
man meant to be kindly and sincere he
did not know the terrible force of that
statement which pierced the heart of the
grieved man as a blade pierces flesh

 chapter vii

 at south devon

a s they pulled into a little cove near
south devon clifford gave a sigh of
relief the men had naught to say they
abandoned the boat and hastened to the
nearest exchange to report the disaster after
bidding good-by to their grief-stricken
passenger

  soon the news spread through the little
town and scores of people left their homes
and their businesses to journey down to
the beacli where the boat stood-a grim
spectacle of the terrible night

  clifford made up his mind that he would
stay in devon until some news of his wife
and children came to him day after day
he went down to the edge of the cliffs and
watched and scanned the great ocean for
some tidings he took the solemn oath that
he would not return to his father or tell
him what had happened in the years to
come he would find surcease in his despair
alone-if fate had separated him forever
from them

  he decided to return to england so he
took the first steamer for liverpool and
went to live in devon because it bore the
same name as the american town in which
he had landed

  he stayed in devon found employment in
a drapers shop and lived with the great-
est frugality every penny that he did not
need for his living expenses he put away
for he intended to make occasional journeys
to america in the hope of finding his loved
ones if they were still alive all that
lloyds could tell him was that the ship had 
never been heard from and was reported to
her owners as a total loss

  tiring of devon and having saved suffi-
cient money he made a trip to new york in
the big american metropolis he found work
and prospered and he grew to like america
so well that he resolved to make it his future
home

  time wore on and he prospered more and
more and then came the day when he fully


the railroad mans magazine

realized that there was no further need to
search so blindly for the wife and little
ones

  they had undoubtedly gone to their
eternal rest in the ocean on that fatal night
-now ten years ago if they were alive he
would have heard from them

   in the course of time clifford became an
american citizen and established his home
in new york he had been in correspond-
ence with his father and had received his
allowance but when he renounced the brit-
ish crown his father asked to see him no
more that was more than he could stand

  but clifford did not desert england
altogether he made frequent trips to
south devon and in the little church there
he erected a memorial window to his dead
he resolved too that he would make fre-
quent journeys to the little town-perhaps
every summer

chapter viii

the nightingale

a goodly portion of the summer of
s- had been spent by george clif-
ford in england it included a lovingly
remembered fortnight in south devon so
dear to him-a land to whose ruddy head-
lands and topaz sands the gulf stream
tired of its lonely windings across the at-
lantic gives warm kisses of welcome

  devon not only receives a largess of
quaint and beautiful seaweeds and brilliant-
hued fish and water like transparent sap-
phires but other beauties that are not for
less lucky coasts the devon air is ever
bland and luscious and the dialect of her
people is full of softened consonants and
emphasized vowels her maidens are
famed for eyes of the hue of the deep waters
off mount edgecomb

  yet aside from its tender memories and
the memorial window the thing that made
the memory of devon dear and lasting to
clifford was just a little bird

   clifford on one of his journeys from new
york had as a fellow passenger on the
altic a fine sturdy mahogany-faced speci-
men of the british squire who like him-
self detested cards and preferred a quiet
talk in the saloon or a promenade on deck

  george trelawney was his name and
he was lord of one of those english country
homes which is a big spreading structure of
gray stone covered with ivy and lichen

stained laced with running roses and bow-
ered in apple orchards with a trout stream
pualing through the surrounding grounds
from a gorse-clad slope one could glimpse
the play and sparkle of the channel

   run down and see us at lynntor when
youve nothing better to do said the squire
with a touch of devonshire dialect

  clifford went to lynntor and the first
night at dinner his host said

  mr clifford you have no nightingales
in america

  no replied clifford-adding with in-
stinctive patriotism  but we have mocking-
birds

  so ive heard so ive heard and fine
singers at that im told but our night-
ingales are a bit different i believe in their
-in their-

  technique ventured mrs trelawney

   thanks dear replied the squire

  we generally go and listen to them if
the night is fine theyre only little brown
birds but as a substitute for grand opera
theyre not bad would you like to hear
them  

    i should be delighted replied clifford

   in the late twilight the party started a
quarter of a mile back from lynntor was a
copse its ledges fringed with clusters of
primroses whose blossoms shone luminous
through the dusk from the copse itself
came many fragrances including those of
countless violets the air was rich and
sweet and full of hints of small sleepy bird
songs in the hedges the glowworms looked
like blobs of brilliant emeralds

  the squire indicated the gnarled knee of
a big oak as a seat for his guest arranged
shawls on a grassy slope for his wife and
was in the act of lighting his brier when
from a point not far distant in the wood
came a tremulous burst of exquisite melody

   the squire slid quietly dowji by the side
of his wife dropped his maton and nodded
to clifford who nodded in return the
unseen minstrels notes grew faint swelled
again quavered stopped and then filled
the night with music

   the far-off recesses of the copse yielded
an answering song the nearer bird replied
in those liquidly tender phrases that make
the nightingales hymnal so infinitely sweet
and so entirely sad it was so clifford said
afterwards as if a lover was telling his
love to her who loved him and who yet was
saddening at the moment of his triumph
knowing that neither love nor beauty last
through by sunrise



   then too there was a longing for things
beyond inspired by the music that seemed
woven out of the magic and mystery of the
perfect night clifford listening felt much
that he had not felt before most did he
feel the rebuke that the aspirational purity
of the tones conveyed to him it was as if
an angel had come to him in the being of
his wife and children so his eyes were
misty and his heart beating heavily when
they started home

       chapter ix
       back in new york

tlt e was back in new york once again

      his cozy apartment seemed more
like home than ever

  nor was his pleasure in his habitation
diminished by the discovery that he had de-
sirable neighbors on the other side of the
hall

  there were four of them and they were
unmistakably bachelor-maids at that they
were young good to look upon possessed
of a certain dainty self-possession many
degrees removed from effrontery kept no
servant usually came in burdened with
divers parcels and made their abode tuneful
at night with girl chat and a piano

  the walls of the lysandria apartments
being not too thick clifford shared in their
talk and their music to the extent of hearing
a pleasant if unrecognizable medley of
both

  the lysandria was a bohemian cara-
vansary of the better class the dwellers
within its walls were for the most part wri-
ters and artists the histrionic element was
sparsely represented by a few of the lamb-
kins from the fold of a neighboring dra-
matic school innocents whose papas and
mamas paid big fees in order that their off-
spring might learn much which they would
have to unlearn if they ever  backed the
lights which ninety-nine per cent of them
never would

  clifford after a chance meeting or two
with his neighbors on the stairway decided
that the tall girl with the pretty face and
tired mouth was a newspaper woman that
the dark plump little soul was in business
-a stenographer or bookkeeper that the
young woman with the corn-silk hair and
dainty figure was a prospective maude
adams-or thought herself to be

  but the last she of the white forehead

placid gray eyes and trembling lips who
was usually dressed in brown and had such
an indefinable charm was the one that at-
tracted him most

  clifford after many guesses at her occu-
pation gave it up but he discovered that
she seemed to be at home more than the
others and that she it was who was respon-
sible for most of the music at night and all
of it by day

  but what attracted him most was that
she appeared to be an indefinable memory
of his he had a vague haunting impres-
sion that he had been with her or talked
with her amid surroundings that were dim-
 dear or somberly sweet

  an inquisitorial review of his woman
friends of the past and even his mere ac-
quaintances resulted in nothing save the
conclusion that he had never met the girl in
all his life

    in all my life he said to himself as he
dabbed mechanically at a bit of moonlight
on a nearly finished canvas for he had ta-
ken up painting to while away his idle
hours

   perhaps not in this life but in some
other life when i was-i was -here he
dropped his maul-stick thoughtfully filled
his pipe and smoked dreamily

  when i was what this is queer i
was-unless im going dotty on the subject
-about to get to the very verge of the little
break in the recollections that lead up to
her and then-then i come to a dead stop
this kind of thing hints at the reincarnation
chaps being  the right track after all yet
it might be inconvenient not to say unpleas-
ant if we could chuck bridges of memory
over to our own and other peoples defunct
pasts suppose i discovered that a couple
of eons ago i borrowed the equivalent of a
thousand dollars from that cad dauber and
didnt make good and dauber had similar
revelation of course the debt would be
outlawed under the statute of limitations
but dauber would talk horribly

  clifford rose and took off his painting
coat

    yet i do wish simply as a matter of sat-
isfied curiosity that i could find out what
has put this idea about the girl into my
head does it come from within or with-
out is it a mild mania or a spiritual in-
tuition it is-oh hang it ill take in
the elysian roof garden to-night and come
back to sanity	

  so matters stood for two or three weeks


the railroad mans magazine

and in die interval the singular impression
that die girl in die brown dress had made
on clifford did not weaken

   in spite of his efforts he failed to estab-
lish a friendship with his neighbors or
rather to advance the acquaintanceship
whose horizons never came closer than a
bow on the stairs and a salutation on die
street

  many were the devices he used to break
down the barriers of reserve which the girls
had built around them but all to no pur-
pose these devices were however of a
legitimate nature for cliffords instinct as
a gentleman debarred him from using aught
else

  for example he sent them a formal invi-
tation to one of his receptions it was as
formally declined on the score of previous
engagements a civic procession was to
pass the lysandria cliffords windows
commanded the street while the windows
of die other flat did not so he sent a mes-
sage to the lysandria janitor to the effect
that his flat was at the service of less for-
tunate tenants but that he desired his neigh-
bors to be included in the invitation

  again a brief and conventional note of
thanks and regrets

  meantime clifford thought that he de-
tected symptoms of trouble in the other
home the girl with the tired mouth began
to look more rired than ever and his
girl was certainly paler and a trifle thinner
than when he met her first

  the music at night became less and less
and the cheery flood of chatter in the eve-
nings had begun to diminish twice and
in the middle of the month he ran across
the man who collected the lysandria rents
calling at the girls flat with a dissatisfied
visage

       chapter x
       a womans voice

hp hex came the incident which estab-
a lished his fears an old southern
mammy had been discovered by him and
used as a model subsequently he discov-
ered that she was a cook of a divine sort
so he made her mistress of his kitchen and
overseer of his household much to her de-
light and his satisfaction

  one evening-he walked out to where she
v-as transmuting chicken into brown-coated
ambrosia and he sketched her while she was

so engaged the dumb-waiter door was
open on the other side of the shelf was
another opening belonging to die other flat
punctuated by die twinkle of plates clif-
ford couldnt help hearing this as spoken by
his girl and another

  mr gillespie says that he must have
the balance of the rent by saturday elaine
i met him on the stairs to-night he was
very unpleasant what shall we do
well came the voice of his girl
after a pause  i still have my bracelet
dear if the worst conies to the worst

  that mustnt be said the other
 youve already done more than your share
for us all besides if you do part with it
it will only put off the evil day

    we wont say that lets say it will tide
us over to the good day

   that never seems to come

    but it wall if we wait long enough on
saturday mr baring has promised to pay
me something on account of my work that
will enable us to look die grocer and the
laundress in the face again i sold diat lit-
tle picture of die surf to mr robinson to-
day for three dollars so that we shant
starve to-morrow anyhow

   three dollars only  what a despicable
shame for any man to offer you that figure
for such a lovely thing

   his  girl laughed cheerily  better
than an empty ice-chest

  true but think what things will go
into robinsons ice-ohest that really and
truly belong to you

   again the others laugh rippled musically
as she said

  well lets hope that he will have in-
digestion but what about yourself
nothing very hopeful the newspa-
pers cut down expenses in the summer you
know i may have a story in the planet a
week from sunday but im not sure i
have exactly four dollars and eighty cents
to collect  monday elaine i wish i
sold matches for a living

   something like a sob followed

  never mind may said the other
well pull through yet

    i suppose so but oh its heartbreak-
ing-this perpetual hoping against hope
this working for-

  now may said the other decisively

 i insist that you sit dowp swallow this cup
of tea and be good

   dont you think suggested may after
a silence that nellie and ethel might-
through by sunrise



well do a little more than they are doing
for the sake of themselves if not for others
 you must remember said elaine gen-
tly that nellies salary is very small and
ethels allowance is only just enough to
cover her studies and incidental expenses
 incidentals in her case include a host of
things that you manage to do without i
notice

  well what are luxuriesto me may be
necessities to her

  you angel cried may impulsively
 always making excuses for others and sac-
rificing yourself why elaine youve worn
that heavy old brown dress of yours all this
summer just because-

    i liked it

  fibber because you couldnt afford
to buy another which you certainly would
have been able to do if you hadnt done
more than your share for the fiat and-
for me

  the speaker sobbed again

   you are in danger of being put to bed
remarked elaine severely

   and-i-know that you had intended
-going home for a-holiday and now-
you-cant

  listen you bad girl replied the other
with mock anger  and listening dry your
tears and rejoice a winning tale i would
tell thee-at least i hope it will be winning
ive struck a theme that is simply delicious
as sure as youre sitting there its going to
capture everybody make me famous all of
us rich and-and-enable us to welcome
gillespie unabashed on the first of the
month

   really

   positively the thing has simply taken
possession of me it will do the same to
the public and may the speakers voice
broke a trifle  i think i shall be able to
see mother this summer after all-if one-
lialf of my hopes about it come true

        chapter xi
        to be answered

at this juncture clifford awoke to the
fact that he was to put it plainly eaves-
dropping with a flush of self-contempt on
his cheek he beat a retreat to the dining-
room muttering things of an uncomplimen-
tary nature about himself

  later when mammy june came to clear
the table she found her chicken untouched

and her employer staring at the gleaming
coffee-pot as if it were a gazing crystal
wherein he was trying to learn his fate and
future

  an hour passed and from the flat next
door came the thrill of music followed by
a series of disconnected dropping flute-like

phrases

  it was as if a string of melody had broken
and its silvern beads were falling in rhyth-
mical confusion

  presently the notes lapsed and died a
death of lingering beauty

  then came a resurrection of exquisite
liquid tones as of a flute played beside a
forest brook the harmony gained strength
and shape but lost none of its repressed
tenderness

  clifford listening felt himself back in
devon the primroses loomed through
the dusk the fragrant copse lay before him
and the song of the nightingale with all
its love and longing was touching the fibers
of his heart

  the music haunted him all the next day
from out the wreaths of misty emotion it
had evoked there seemed to gradually shape
an interpretation of his feeling for elaine

  the love notes of the nightingale had
caused something in his heart to vibrate in
unison the silent music of the girls had
renewed the work of the little brown bird
then a daring inspiration came to him-
one of those inspirations that took imme-
diate action during the day he dropped
in on doure doure was a musician who
had he cared might have been much more
than what he was a partner of and the
 arranger  for a well-known firm of music
publishers he put crudc material into the
crucible of his genius and the result was
music

  doure said clifford this is a con-
fidential mission ive a theme suggested by
the song of the nightingale ever heard
them

  doure had

  now i want you to retain the melody
but put your soul into the-the frills so to
speak i mean the introduction the ac-
companiment and the interludes

  doure nodded he was chary of words
then he listened and jotted notes on a
music score

  when will it be finished

  in a hurry

  in a desperate hurry

  to-morrow afternoon no-evening
too

the railroad mans magazine

    good come round and dine with me
 and bring it with you

   another nod and a grunt on the part of
 doure and clifford departed

   clifford had the knack of writing rimes
 when the humor seized him and the humor
 was strong upon him now

   so	he proceeded to fit words to the music
 that was insistently beating on his heart and
 brain i forget most of the lines but the
 final verse ran thus

 oli bird oh unseen bird

    who art by night and leafy curtains liid

whose throat and heart alike by love are stirred
whose song into my waiting life has slid

 oh bird with passioned trill

 beneath the stars above

would not thy song with joy more fully thrill

 in the dear day of love

   doure was punctual dinner ended and
 the pair adjourned to cliffords den where-
 in was a piano from the flat next door
 came the ripple of music doure opened
 the instrument

   want to try it over he asked

   the other nodded but not without a
 curious tightening around his heart doure
 began to play

   clifford was a fair musician as amateurs
 go and the owner of a good robust barytone
 voice the influences of the hour were
 strong upon him and his voice waxed more
 tender with the advent of each line doure
 had done his part magnificently and in the
 pauses clifford under the spell of the
 music once more felt himself in the shadow
 of the devonshire copse

   good muttered doure as the song
 ended  want to try it again  

   before clifford could answer there came
 a hesitating ring at the bell of the private
 hall

   the artist answered it there stood
 his girl her white cheeks told that she
 was laboring under distressful emotion

   mr clifford i believe she said with
 an effort

   yes wont you come in

   thank you no said the girl and he
 could see the fluttering in her throat

   my housekeeper is here and mr
 doure of whom you may have heard re-
 marked clifford with gentle insistence

   mr doure of blank  company

    yes

    oh said the girl doubtfully  i met
 him once but-

    may i suggest that you renew his ac-

 quaintance he is a very dear friend of

 mine

   she hesitated for a moment glanced at
 clifford and then stepped inside

  the man led the way to the parlor and
was in the act of summoning doure when
she stopped him

    before mr doure comes here she said
 haltingly will you permit me to ask you
 a question  

    certainly

    i heard you-at least i presume it was
 you-singing to-night

   clifford could see the unshed tears in her
 eyes

   will you-can you-tell me where you
got that song

   clifford was for the moment at a loss to
 answer the situation had developed on
 such different lines from what he had an-
 ticipated she misunderstood his silence
 and went on eagerly

  pray do not think me impertinent i
write songs for a livelihood i-thought i
had-an original theme on which i was
counting much

   she sighed deeply

   but i have heard it-to-night-here
it must she smiled have been uncon-
scious cerebration on my part i suppose
clifford groaned in spirit as he saw her
distress she was younger than he had an-
ticipated-much younger something drew
him to her queerly

   miss-

    aldyce

  miss aldyce will you permit me to
reply to your question before i call mr
doure  

    if you wisli she said looking at him
 with mild astonishment

  then pardon me for a moment

   he left the room and returned presently
 with the roll of music and a manuscript

    before i apologize to you for the great
 liberty i have taken with you and yours
 allow me to show you a copy of the words
 you heard me singing to-night please no-
 tice that the date that they bear is three
 days ago

   still wondering the girl looked and read
 the nightingale words by george clif-
 ford music by elaine-

  i did not know your full name then
explained the man quietly the girl crim-
soned but ansvered not

   this was done to-night went on clif-
 ford
through by sunrise



 there was silence for a space and then
 elaine spoke

  but what have you done-i cannot un-
 derstand all this mr clifford she said in
 a perplexed voice

  will you as a preliminary assure me
 that if i make my motive clear you will
 at least try to forgive me for those things

 he indicated the music and the manu-
 script

  im much indebted- she began

  is it a bargain 

  of which i have unquestionably the
 best she had recovered her spirits and
 looked radiant

  well then i was impertinent enough
 to think that a personal introduction to
 doure might be of some service to you
 and i knew it could be best brought about
 by this he tapped the music

 then you overheard me playing

  i did-and ive an excellent memory
 for musicwhen i want to remember

  but the words are exactly those that i

to be o

wanted how did you know my theme
was the nightingale  

    i have heard the birds and you too i
know

    yes

    that shows the faithfulness of your
treatment of the subject

    but-mr clifford why all this trouble
-this interest in-an-unknown 

    because- he looked at her with elo-
quent eyes  i thought you deserved it
and-miss aldyce-it was very hard to
get an introduction to you by conventional
methods now ill call doure

   he started to go for his friend then
he halted-looked at her steadfastly a mo-
ment and said

    do tell me where did you hear the
nightingale sing

  where dont ask me mr clifford
it is too sad a story i cant bear to think
of it

    you must tell me  he said  you
must tell me

down in her arms in a vain endeavor to stop its

followed his advice

the president of one of the prominent rail-
way corporations in america was making
a stirring address to an audience of young men
and dwelt with particular emphasis on the neces-
sity of making a good appearance

   when you are looking for work he said
 be careful that you are presentable if you
have only twenty-four dollars in the world spend
twenty dollars for a suit of clothes three dollars
and a half for a pair of shoes fifty cents for a
hair-cut and shave then walk up to the job
wherever it is and ask for it like a man

  this advice was greeted with great applause
and the railway president sat down amid a storm
of cheers

  the very next morning a dapper-looking young
fellow walked into the outer office of the orator
and handing a note to the clerk said 

   please give this to the president

  the note read as follows

   i have paid twenty dollfrs for this suit of
clothes three dollars and a half for a pair of
shoes and fifty cents for a hair-cut and shave i
have walked from harlem and i would like a job
as conductor on your line

  he got the job

             loquacious louie and his fellow wayfarer
             embark for a day in an infant industry

hat job of near - work of
petes when he did the res-
cue act at the powder works
said loquacious louie  puts
me in mind of the time i
was offered a job holding a
kid for a small woman who was in a large
hurry and the mix-up my refusal of the
job was responsible for

   i was loafing outside of a railroad
station one day when a woman rushed up
to me and asked me to hold her baby while
she went inside and bought a ticket

  avaunt madam i replied do i
look like the first vice-president of a
foundling asylum you are on the wrong
wireless my specialty is finance if you
want me to hold your purse while you take
the kid inside and have it checked im
legible

   she gave me the exqumaw optic and
rushed over to an easy-looking mark close
by i saw her say something to him and
he took the baby then she took a coin
from her purse and handing it to him
made for the ticket-office i walked over
and gave him the wayfarers wink

  what you going to do with the kid
i asked

   im going to adopt it and leave it all
my money he replied  what dyou think
i was going to do with it offer it for a
prize in a guessing contest  

   well if you did i says  i wouldnt
want more than one guess and that would
be that your female lady-friend is trying to
unload that baby on you didnt you ever
hear of that old stunt of getting rid of
a baby  	t

   sure i have he answered  but you

dont think im going to turn down real
money simply on account of an infant incu-
batus do you 

   say i asked  whats the use of
taking chances if that female dont come
to claim her kid i see you doing the shap-
pyrone act for life

    aw shut up he growled  do you
want to wake this slumbering volcano  

   i was on the point of making the re-
tort cortuous when a porter deposited a
trunk on the platform as prescribed by
the code and the easy-looking mark started
to earn his money the kid emerged from
slumberland and gave one of those shanty-
cleer crows but when it saw what was
holding it it started to yell like a peek-a-
boo indian

     better tell it a fairy-story i advised
 that may keep it quiet cinder ella is
a favorite with the kids

   the easy-looking mark gave me a scorn-
ful look and started to walk the indigent
infant up and down trying to quiet it i
watched him hiking up and down the plat-
form and noticed that his interest in his
job took him farther away on each suc-
ceeding lap

   i was patting myself on the back be-

cause it wasnt me that was holding down
that strenuous situation when a fellow
rushed up to me and before i could enter
any objections plumped a baby bunting
into my arms and made a rush for the
ticket-office -

    hey come back i shouted  do i
look like a depository for surplus in-
fants  

  that fellow evidently took you for a
man of family commented pugilistic
patrick

  well who said i wasnt demanded
louie  i guess ive had as much family
as most people ive had the usual job-
lot of fathers mothers grandfathers and
grandmothers and so on im like the
blooming aristocrat-im long on ancestry
but short on pro-jenny and im the last of
my line

  well as i said that fellow shanghaied
that innocent infant on the largeness of my
manly bosom and left me there feeling
fussed and fearful supposing that kid
took a notion to go into executive session
like the one the easy-looking mark was
holding i saw my finish i was trying to
decide on a course of action in case my
prize-package awoke from its suspended

 animation when that woman who had given
 the duplicate to the easy-looking mark
 rushed up and grabbed the kid out of my
 arms she murmured something that
 sounded like thanks and mamas tootsie-
 wootsie and rushed aboard the south-bound
 train which was about to pull out

    i felt too relieved to be astonished
 when the mistaken mother relieved me of
 that kid she also relieved me of a large
 chunk of anxiety i looked around for the
 easy-looking mark and located him at the
 other end of the station i made my way
 toward him as the train pulled out

   when i reached him his infant had
 quieted down and seemed to be treating him
 like an infinity it had evidently made up
 its mind to accept him at face value and
 take its chances

     say i chortled in triumph  what
 did i tell you she has went

   oh youre a profit all right he
 growled  likewise youre an innishiate
 of the inner shrine of i-told-you-sos if i
 had your power of preception id hire out
 as a sight-seeing see-saw what if she has
 went

      but shes got the wrong kid i said and
 then i told him about the hurrying henry
 who had mistaken me for a truant officer
 and how the unnatural mother had taken
 me for a bargain-counter and depleted my
 stock of babies

 i the easy-looking mark grinned

   heres where i unload on an unsus-
  pecting public he said  keep your eye
  on your uncle dudley whats the use of
 working when gray matter has the red
 corpuskels gasping for breath on the home-
 stretch  

   he walked along the platform carry-
 ing the kid innocently while i stood there
 and wondered what kind of a game he was
 going to pull off

   pretty soon that buckaneer what had
 abandoned that infant to my tender mercies
 rushed up and grabbed the kid out of the
 easy-looking marks arms and pushing a
 bill into his hand hustled aboard a train
 that was about to pull out in the opposite
 direction from the one the woman had
 taken

   well what do you think of that for
 head work  asked the easy-looking mark
 joining me

    great i replied  while your brain
 is working suppose you tell me where i
 come in on this youve got all the emolu-

 ments incruing from this deal and as an
 equal partner in your iniquity it seems to
 me that i should come in for a dividend
 just you wait until a dividend is de-
 clared he replied  theres only a dol-
 lar-fifty in the treasury and thats not
 enough to declare a dividend on

      say i protested  you dont expect to
get any more out of this mix-up do you
i should think the incident was closed
closed he said well i guess
not take two fond doting parents each
with the wrong infant on hand and the
situation is as full of possibilities as your
head seems to be deficient in ideas

     how in the name of the infant indus-
try do you expect to make anything inore
out of this mix-up  i asked

     as i said before he replied  just you
keep your eye on your uncle dudley and
youll learn a lot about high finance if
something dont happen in the money mar-
ket pretty soon i miss my guess

   there was no use arguing with that
fellow especially as he held all the trumps
so i shut up we hung around that sta-
tion for about half an hour and then a
train pulled in about the first passenger
to get off was that buckaneer who had acted
as chief mixer in the mix-up he still
carried the kid in his arms likewise a
troubled look on his countenance he made
straight for me the minute he spotted me
and tried to place the kid in my anns

  no you dont i said dodging be-
hind the easy-looking mark

  that fellow tried to circulate around
the easy-looking mark who immediately got
busy he took the kid away from the fren-
zied father and made a bluff at examining
it to see if it was all right

  see here you darned stiff he said

 what dyou mean by swiping that kid away
from me that was given to me by a lady
to hold a fine mess youve got me into
  but what has become of the baby i
gave to some one to hold   asked the puz-
zled parent in troubled accents

    i dont know anything about any baby
you gave to any one to hold answered the
easy-looking mark  whod you give it to
if i didnt give it to you answered
the puzzled parent  i gave it to some one
who looks like you perhaps it was your
friend he continued looking at me

   say do i look like that  asked the
easy-looking mark and me pointing at one
anbther
s

the railroad mans magazine

   the maker of the motion refused to
vote so the easy-looking mark continued

    i was standing here this morning
when a lady asked me to hold her baby
while i was performing this trifling serv-
ice to the best of my ability you butted
in and forcibly relieved me of the infant
when the lady found that some one had kid-
naped her child she gave me all sorts for
my seeming carelessness and finally took
possession of the infant you had thrust
upon my friend here claiming that you
had brought the baby here to facilitate the
execution of your scheme

    which way did she go   asked the
frenzied father

    say look here answered the easy-
looking mark kinder offended-like  dyou
take me for a blooming bureau of informa-
tion or a sideboard of statistics youve
got me into a pretty mess with your bung-
ling here ive got to stand around with
this kid and wait for the right owner to
turn up whos going to pay me for my
time and trouble id like to know 

  the sucker fell for the bait all right

    if you can tell me where the woman
went he said  i will give you five dollars
and in addition ill take the child to her
oh ill tell you where she went all
right replied the easy-looking mark  and
ill take your five dollars all right but
when it comes to surrendering this infant
to any one but its rightful owner its nix
for you the old guard may die on the
job but it never surrenders

  which way did she go asked the
sucker handing the easy-looking mark a
five-dollar bill

   she took a carriage lied the easy-
looking mark  and she said she was going
to hunt up the town burgess to see about
getting a warrant for your arrest no doubt
you will find her at his place and be able
to square things dont forget to tell her
that im waiting here for her with an un-
redeemed package

  that fellow swallowed the dope all
right and started off after he made his
get-away the easy-looking mark handed me
a dollar and told me to get two one-way
tickets for berwyn

   what you want to go to berwyn for 
 because he replied  thats where the
lady what owns this kid went she asked
me to hold it while she went in and got a
ticket to berwyn go on and get the
tickets

    say i protested  what you want to
ride inside for has the possession of so
much money at once affected your head 

    i dont want to ride inside any more
than you do he replied  but you cant
ride on a brake-beam when youre handi-
capped with an infant of tender age

but whats the graft  i asked

    as i said several times before and re-
iterate once more again he replied  keep
your eye on your uncle dudley now hus-
tle and get that transportation

  well i got the tickets and when the
train pulled in we climbed aboard i was
glad to get into a good soft seat for the
pace that easy-looking mark had set was
rather strenuous and seemed to affect my
physical incapacity

   there werent many people on the train
consequently there wasnt much comment
passed about our doing the beauty and the
beast stunt although the conductor did
look at us pretty hard and asked us how
we liked riding inside

  when the train reached berwyn we got
off the easy-looking mark went up to
the station-agent and asked him if he knew
the lady what owned the baby had she got-
ten off of an earlier train could he tell us
where she lived and could he spare a chew
of tobacco

  the station-agent pleaded guilty to the
first three counts but ignored the last he
said he knew her likewise she had got off
of the  and lived in the house with
the gray gables that was anchored on top
of a hill about a mile away which he
pointed out

   also he told us that it looked like rain
and that the crops needed it and that the
farmers thereabout were having a hard time
raising enough crops to pay for their auto-
mobiles when we were a half-mile up
the pike he was still talking with his face
and both hands he was a very vollible
man he was i think that he kept on talk-
ing sos we couldnt get a chance to brace
him for a hand-out

  that easy-looking mark was a natural-
born nurse-girl that innocent infant treat-
ed him with perfect trust and behaved in a
dignified discreet way we went tramp-
ing along that hot pike with peace in our
hearts and money on our minds and once
when the beauty of that pastureal scene
caused me to forget myself and offer to
carry the kid it was only the emphatically-
voiced protest of the leather-lunged young-
the boes and the babies



ster that brought me back to the prosaic
pike

when we got near the place we saw
the babys mother sitting on the wide ver-

  what am i going to do with it   she
asked in surprise  what should i do with
it but keep it 

   see here madam said the easy-look-

do i look
like that 

anda which ran around the house she saw
us coming with the infant and came to
meet us

    how good of you to bring him up
she gurgled  i didnt discover my mis-
take until i was half-way home and she
took the kid and started to talk infantyglot
to it

    madam said the easy-looking mark
breaking in on hex foolishness  the gent
what owns that other baby is down at the
other station making unparliamentary re-
marks about people what dont know their
own children

  he is is he says lie lady kinder
fussed like  ill give him a few points
on parliamentary usage when i see him
ill teach him how to care for infants

   but lady persisted the easy-looking
mark  what are you going to do with the
other kid  

ing mark gently but firmly  that other
baby belongs to the gent what left the other
baby with my friend here hes back there
worrying his head off about it

    i am aware that it belongs to him
answered the lady  but it also belongs to
me these two babies are twins all
babies look alike to my husband so i am
compelled to put some distinguishing mark
on whichever baby he takes out so that he
will be able to identify it

    this morning when he started out to
visit his mother i called his attention to the
fact that little arthur whom he was taking
along was trimmed up with blue baby-rib-
bon when things got mixed up down at
palmar and he found that he had a baby
with pink baby-ribbon trimmings he natur-
ally jumped at the conclusion that he had
somebody elses baby

  then said the easy-looking mark


the railroad mans magazine

with an ear-to-ear grin  both babies be-
long here

    certainly replied the lady  i wish
you would tell my husband when you re-
turn to palmar that i have both babies
here safely at home

our way to the station we saw him first
consequently he didnt have an opportunity
to hold converse with us we suddenly
became interested in cross-country running
and never stopped until we struck the rail-
road

    madam said the easy-looking mark
 i dont see how were going to get back
to palmar it took all the money we had
to bring the baby up here besides weve
both lost a day away from our regular
occupation i think some one should make
it good

  well he put it up to her with such
candor that she couldnt very well repudi-
ate the obligation she insisted on giving
him a five-dollar bill which he accepted
with seeming reluctance and we bade her
farewell after promising to ship her hus-
band home to her

   did you see the father of the twins
again asked phonograph pete

  yes replied loquacious louie we
saw him coming up the pike as we were on

   we hopped aboard the first freight that
came along and by night we were many
miles from the land of easy living the
easy-looking mark called a meeting of the
board of directors and declared a dividend
of five dollars and fifty cents apiece

   i gladly voted him a resolution of
thanks and we separated and went our va-
rious ways

   did you learn the name of that high
financier asked phonograph pete

   i asked him what he was called re-
plied loquacious louie and he said

 wherever i go they call me blessed i
guess he lied

  well commented pete i wouldnt
say he lied exactly but i do think he used
the wrong word

a leaky engine is like a talkative woman-it makes more noise than
a good one and refuses to dry up-the wails of a wiper

 didnt discover my mistake until i was half-way home
the a b g of freight rates

by john c thomson

of recent years we have heard a great deal of talk between the railroads
the shippers and the interstate commerce commission  the subject of
freight rates few writers have given us any information on the subject
that has not been such a wearisome maze of unfamiliar terms and expressions
that we might as well have read a chinooks essay  cheese

     almost every time we go into a store to buy something particularly if we
live in a city we unwittingly pay freight charges to one railroad system or an-
other so that there is every reason why we should be interested in knowing how
these charges come to differ so greatly from each other and what it is that they
go to pay for

    the problem of just and equal freight charges which mr thomson ex-
plains is one of the most involved in the whole field of modern commerce but
lie has approached it in such a simple masterful manner and has so carefully
avoided confusing the reader with a lot of unintelligible stock expressions that
we believe he has succeeded in throwing a great deal of light on a subject that
concerns us all whether we are railroaders or not

some of the difficulties of apportioning freight charges that worry a
railroad and keep the interstate commerce commission
at work hearing the protests of shippers

is usually the case that an expert
in any line-be it war medi-
cine or freight rates-is the
least capable of all men to ex-
plain his profession to the pub-
lic words that to the expert
are an every-day matter are to the outsider
things of mystery hence they are in the
position of a frenchman trying to explain
the arabian nights in the original to a
german each speaking a different language
with no common meeting-ground whatever

  the best newspaper editor i ever knew
used to employ a landsman even one who
could not swim to report all cases of ship-
wreck because he knew that most of his
readers were landsmen and could not un-
derstand the sailor-talk which a seaman
would naturally use in his report this is
largely the reason for the fact that the rail-

roads have wasted millions of dollars in
trying to educate the public concerning
railroad freight rates and that the public
is still in darkness about what deeply
and directly affects every pocketbook in
the united states

freight department nomenclature

  in other words as a general rule railroad
men cannot write clearly about freight rates
the phrases water competition joint
cost  blanket rates  class rates are a
part of the railroaders native tongue as
clear and commonplace as the words  cow
 ax and  home   and he uses these ob-
scure terms in almost every sentence he
writes or speaks about freight rates but
these technical terms are not understood by
the public and in fact are practically an


the railroad mans magazine

unknown language even to large shippers
who spend hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars every year for freight charges

  in this article i shall try to explain some
of the factors that go to make up freight
rates in the words of die man in the street
and shall try to discuss this complicated
subject-one of the most complex known
to the business world-in terms such as
smidi uses to jones smith being a butcher
and jones a doctor if the expert radroad
man feels inclined to smile at times over
these lines let him but open a medical book
and read a few pages then he will-see why
this article is not written in  railroad lan-
guage but in  united states with which
the non-railroader and the railroader not in
the freight department is more familiar

  to begin at the beginning it might be
mentioned that  distribution  is a part of
production not something different
when a man sends an article from new
york to san francisco he does just the
same thing as if he moved it from one side
of his work-bench to another so as to get it
into a more convenient position that he may
work on it to better advantage the dif-
ference is only one of degree-simply a
changing of places

what the consumer pays for

  now every business man-in fact every
consumer-is deeply interested in the
cost of production  we hear so much about
but few of them fully realize that the rail-
road freight rate is one of its most impor-
tant items

  for example suppose a man has a farm
ten miles from the railroad in kansas and
raises wheat wheat on the kansas farm
means bread sooner or later in new york
cityr or in seattle he sends a certain
amount of wheat to market say to new
york the cost of pulling the load from
the farm to the railroad by horses is about
five dollars the cost of pulling the wheat to
new york city is about five dollars and
the cost of cartage through the streets of
new york city is about two dollars

  this twelve dollars is a part of what the
bread costs when served on a new york
city dinner-table now the average man
will set up a roar if the farmer gets one
dollar and ten cents for his wheat instead of
one dollar but he usually ignores an in-
crease of ten cents in the freight rate which
amount to the same thing to the final bread-

eater the same thing applies to meat
clothing shoes hats and in fact to every-
thing used by human beings

  therefore the importance is seen i hope
without further expansion here of the rail-
road freight rate to every nan woman and
child in the united states nothing affects
the price of real estate the monthly rent
more than railroad rates cities have been
made and ruined by changes of freight rates
and so have individuals by the tens of thou-
sands although as a general rule few of
these knew what ruined them or made their
fortunes as the case may be

   mileage  and  joint cost  charges

  now what is a freight rate it is the
total charge made by a railroad or a ship
or a canal-boat or a horse - and - wagon
freighter for taking anything from one place
to another what the waiter is to the dining-
room the railroad is to the nation the manu-
facturer in this case being the cook while
you and i sit at the tables and pay the bills
in this article we shall deal largely with
railroad freight rates only touching on ca-
nal ship and wagon rates only as they
affect the railroad freight rate

  at first glance it looks simple enough
this matter of making just freight rates
 if it costs one dollar to haul one ton one
mile then it surely costs two dollars to haul
one ton two miles or two tons one mile
argues the average individual from a com-
mon-sense standpoint

  this is known as the  mileage basis or
charging for hauling goods according to the
distance hauled but soon we shall see that
this apparently simple proposition is impos-
sible in every-day practise the mileage
basis is the one the public are urging
while the railroads fight for the joint-cost
system of charging for hauling

a multiplicity of costs

  joint cost is somewhat harder to make
plain and perhaps a simple illustration
known to every one will help to make the
matter clearer when you go into a restau-
rant and order a twenty-five-cent meal you
get let us suppose the use of the room
table knife fork and spoon dishes table-
cloth napkin etc free of apparent charge
at least nothing appears on the bill for these
items yet they must be paid for and paid
for by the eater of the meal
the a b c of freight rates	

  the meal itself consists of soup boiled
beef potatoes bread and butter coffee and
a piece of pie the restaurant charges only
for the meal apparently but it is clear to
every one that the bill includes a charge for
the other things just mentioned such as the
dishes the rent the lights etc now the
bread and butter is also free but there is an
extra charge of five cents for another cup
of coffee and ten cents for an extra piece
of pie

  this means that the restaurant-keeper
makes nothing on the soup he loses money
on the bread and butter he makes only
three cents gross on the meat and one cent
gross on the potatoes and four cents on the
coffee yet the whole meal yields him a final
net profit of say two cents

  in other words the restaurant man does
not make an equal profit on each kind of
food sold but in fact actually loses money
on some kinds that must be served such as
the bread or the use of the table or the
knife and fork but makes up this loss on
his coffee or pie so practically he charges
o- each item just  what the traffic will
bear and by putting it all in together turns
out a cheaper meal to the eater than if he
charged for each item separately

a system that averages up

   in fact it would be practically impossible
to charge the man who stayed ten minutes
and gulped down a cup of coffee and a piece
of pie a just proportion of the rent and light
bill as compared with the family that spent
two hours in the place and ate up half a
turkey so the restaurant man meets these
overhead charges as they are called by a
more or less indefinite joint-cost system
he charges twenty-five cents for certain eat-
ables as a whole and out of them nets a
profit of two cents

  to attempt to charge each man his exact
proportion of the rent the light the laundry
and other bills would be to try to put into
operation the mileage basis in abstract
theory this last is the proper one no doubt
but it cannot be put into practise this is
clear enough to every one in the case of the
restaurant man but it is not so clear in
regard to the railroad man and his freight-
rate charges yet it is just as true

   the average man we will say ships a ton
of wheat and a ton of coal from kansas
city to denver the railroad charges him
say one dollar for hauling the coal and two

dollars for hauling the wheat though they
make the trip in the same car and one takes
no more space or makes any more trouble
than the other here is where the average
man sets up a howl and insists-with much
reason at first sight-that if the railroad
makes a fair profit on the coal for one dol-
lar it is robbing him on the wheat at two
dollars

bunching the charges

   but the fact is that it is just as impos-
sible in this case to figure out the exact
charge of the railroad presidents salary and
the track-walkers monthly pay that the ton
of coal should bear and that the ton of wheat
should bear as it is to figure out the same
problem in the restaurant case just illustra-
ted the railroad must bunch the charges
and get three dollars for the two tons
-one of coal and one of wheat-even
though on the coal it makes only ten cents
profit and on the wheat twenty cents profit
in a rough way this illustrates  joint cost 
as the railroad man uses the term when
talking of freight rates

  but now the plot thickens as the dime-
novelists say in the preceding paragraph
we have seen how the charge differs on two
different articles when hauled the same dis-
tance in the same car now let us take
another case the very bone of contention in
the present freight - rate situation that is
attractjng national attention this is char-
ging less for hauling the same article per-
haps in the -same car a long distance than
for a short distance

  take the case for instance of two tons
of wheat one going from kansas city to
denver and another in the same car going
on through denver to san francisco when
the car stops at denver the denver man
pays let us say two dollars to cover the cost
of hauling the wheat from kansas city
the car door is locked and the car rolls
away to san francisco the san francisco
man pays only one dollar to the railroad for
moving his ton of wheat twice as far as the
other fellows and the denver man shouts
till stones begin to jar loose from the top of
pikes peak

where the shipper kicks

  rank injustice  cries the denver-man
and many agree with him including to
some extent the interstate commerce com-
mission


the railroad mans magazine

  but at the hearing the badgered rail-
road man shows the following conditions
and even one-the denver man and even
the interstate commerce commission-feel
vaguely that they are up against a problem
that is almost impossible to solve here is
the case the railroad man shows that if
he charged say three dollars to haul that
ton of wheat to san francisco the man
in san francisco would not ship at all but
would buy his wheat from south america
getting it by ship from around the horn
the southern end of south america

the railroads justification

  then the railroad would have only one
ton of wheat to haul-the one to the denver
man-and would have to charge him three
dollars for hauling it from kansas city to
denver instead of the two dollars it now
gets the railroad must be kept up and a
two-dollar income will not do it it must
have three dollars from some one or go out
of business so by charging the san fran-
cisco man one dollar a ton it can afford to
haul to denver for two dollars

  but the denver man says

  you surely will not haul goods at a
loss to san francisco if you make a
profit say of ten cents on the one dollar
charge to san francisco you should charge
me the denver man only fifty cents and
make a profit of five cents

  and the railroad man answers

   it costs me two dollars and fifty cents to
run the road and ten cents to haul to denver
and twenty-five cents to haul to san fran-
cisco both hauls being from kansas city
this is a total cost of two dollars and eighty-
five cents for both hauls i charge three
dollars for the two hauls and make fifteen
cents profit

  now if i cannot haul to san francisco
for one dollar i cannot haul there at all
therefore the denver man would have to pay
the cost of the road two dollars and fifty
cents plus the cost of hauling to denver
ten cents or two dollars and sixty cents plus
a profit even the five cents he mentions a
total charge to him of two dollars and sixty-
five cents or sixty-five cents more than he is
paying now besides there then would be
no railroad from denver to san francisco
a very bad thing for the denver man when
he wants japanese silk or chinese floor-
matting shipped to him from san fran-

  to this the denver man must agree as
there is no way out of it but he conies
back at the railroad from another point of
the compass thus

   your railroad is paying dividends of
fifty per cent a year on the actual money
invested you are making too much money
you are getting more than your share
charge one dollar to san francisco if you
must but cut my charge to denver down
from two dollars to one dollar in other
words to use a railroaders slang expression
reduce the  hump  at denver

  the denver man is more or less right in
this at least the recent decisions of the
united states supreme court and of the
interstate commerce commission seem to so
indicate as a matter of climax it might
be mentioned in passing the interstate com-
merce commission is mentioned after the
supreme court for the court follows to a
large extent the fundamental principles
gradually being worked out by the interstate
commerce commission in past years the
court has practically reversed its position on
a number of vital questions pertaining to
railroad freight rates as national experience
has educated the court as it lias the com-
mission and the public

an unsolved problem

   freight rates odd as it may seem at first
thought are almost a new item in commer-
cial life especially in america no human
brain or no millions of human brains can
at once solve such a weighty problem it is
as vital as deeply important as is banking
with which the world has been experiment-
ing for centuries and has not yet solved
but in banking and in money affairs gen-
erally we are much farther advanced in
practical working knowledge than in the
subject of freight rates

  if the united states were as smooth as a
floor with the same climate throughout the
year in all parts of the country with no
snows in winter no rocky mountains to
cross no big crops to haul in the fall no
other nations to send goods to our ports by
ships and no more people in new york city
than in reno nevada then railroad freight
rates would be a simple matter the  mile-
age basis would be the only thing to conr
sider but such things cannot be hence the
bewildered rate-maker resorts to joint cost
to keep the railroad running and growing

  now because a system has abuses is no
the a b c of freight rates



reason for doing away entirely with that
system to set lire to the barn to kill the
rats will kill the rats all right but how
about the barn the live stock in winter and
the farmer because this joint-cost system
has been and no doubt is to-day greatly
abused in robbing the public through watered
stocks in wall street this is no reason for
burning the joint cost barn just to kill
these financial rats

   we as a people must pay freight charges
according to either the mileage basis or
the joint-cost system at least we must
use them till some one invents a new system
now all undreamed of by man and that
seems a long way off

  in some cases the two seem to have been
combined with more or less success thus
the freight-rate charges from the atlantic
seaboard to the mississippi river in the
states north of the ohio river are a mix-
ture to some extent of both the mileage
and the joint-cost system but more of
this later enough to say here that there
are no mountains to cross in this section no
wide stretches of unpopulated country and
that traffic is regular enough to keep the cars
full all the year round traveling in any
direction east and west west and east north
and south south and north-all things that
deeply affect freight rates

  now to change the subject somewhat
the railroad man cannot talk two minutes
about rates without using three terms
that at once cause a blank expression on the
face of his lay listener among these are
 class rates  commodity rates and
flat or blanket rates

an explanation of class rates

  on the witness-stand the average rate-
maker can toss and juggle these pet terms
of his till the court-room goes round and
round to the learned judge and even to the
questioning lawyer while the man in the
backseat reaches for his hat tiptoes out into
the hall and takes refuge in a smoke for-
bid a railroad rate man usin these three
terms and you might as well put a muzzle
on him he cant talk thats all there is to
it now let us see what they mean these
three sacred terms

  first of all i will give an example of
class rates to ship a bass drum costs
more per pound than to ship iron-ore the
drum takes more space in the car and is
more liable to get broken it also was placed

on the train by hand while the iron-ore is
dumped by the car-load and nothing except
a blast furnace can change its value

  bass drums baby-carriages and air-ships
are more fragile however and such kind of
things are roughly grouped into a class
carpets gunny-sacks canvas etc might be
grouped into another class crowbars
nails chains etc into still another class
and so on

  these classes are constantly shifting more
or less that is on some roads crowbars
might be in class iii and on another road
in class iv but this is a minor matter
enough to say that certain things more or
less alike from a shipping standpoint are
classed together and the freight charges on
all things in one class are equal

 commodity rates

  thus if the railroad charges  on crow-
bars it also charges  on nails and if the
charge is  on bass drums it is also 
on air-ships this is what is meant by
 class rates and by the terms  first class
second class double first class etc
depending on the nature of the goods the
roads over which they go etc in practise
these classes are much alike on all roads

  but as we have seen in the case of joint
cost some goods will not move as the rail-
road man so aptly expresses it or in other
words will not be shipped if the charge is
too high take the case of nails for in-
stance we will say that both nails and
crowbars are made in chicago and nails
but not crowbars are made in kansas city

  now the railroad can charge  for crow-
bars from chicago to omaha but if it
charges  on nails then another road will
haul nails to omaha from kansas city for
fifty cents so no nails will move out of
chicago for omaha so the nails are taken
out of their class and given a special
rate of fifty cents

  this special rate is called a  commodity
rate the public knows what a special
rate is but for some reason the railroad
man prefers to call it a  commodity rate
a term much less apt and clear than  special
rate however the railroad man does
make a special rate at times something
in regard to freight what excursion rates are
to the passenger service now that we have
seen what class rates and commodity
rates are we will take up flat or
blanket rates


the railroad mans magazine

  new york boston philadelphia and
other near-by cities all want to ship goods
to denver colorado for instance each
city has some one claim over all the others
new york for instance has a large ton-
nage to ship while pittsburg is nearer
though it has a somewhat smaller amount of
goods to transport

  also the kind of goods vary greatly pitts-
burgh ships iron and new york dresses
hats and so on so the railroad puts these
cities all on an equal footing as to rates
and charges the same price for hauling the
same kind of goods say paint and varnish
from all the atlantic coast cities to all the
colorado cities

  to do this is to make a  flat rate  to
all the cities alike or in the picturesque
language of the rail to  lay a blanket over
the coast cities and the colorado common
points here we meet a new term  com-
mon points that cuts a very deep figure in
railroad freight matters

 blanket or flat rates

  a  common point  in freight-rates mat-
ters is much like the wholesale house in
other business lines thus because of its
size and location denver colorado can
handle more business than can fort collins
colorado whieh is about seventy-five miles
north and on but one railroad just as the
man who buys a pound of beefsteak cannot
expect to get the same low price as the man
who buys a trainload of steers so fort
collins- cannot expect to get as low a rail-
road rate as denver

  but pueblo colorado on the other hand
one hundred and more miles to the south
of denver has a large trade and is the com-
mon business center for quite a number of
small towns scattered around within one
hundred miles or so in other words den-
ver pueblo new york chicago and other
places are common points not only in
a railroad sense but in many other busi-
ness ways in other wcrrds all common
points are under a blanket or flat
rate when the freight charges from such
points are equal

  comparing roughly freight and passen-
ger rates we have in the passenger service
the first and second class the pullman the
drawing-room the special car and even the
-pedal-train service these in the freight
end are  class rates we have special or
excursion rates in the passenger service

which are commodity rates when applied
to freight and when tickets are the same
price from new york and boston to san
francisco and seattle in the passenger
service we find the corresponding condition
in the freight department called  blanket 
or  flat  rates

no hair-splitting

  now let no expert railroad man grin
grab his pen and break into print over this
rough-cut comparison or over other equally
rough-hewn illustrations in this article any
more than should a horseman if i had said
that horses and cows were more or less alike
in that each have long tails are covered
with hair eat hay give milk etc as com-
pared to whales or eagles the whole sub-
jectxof freight-rates cannot be handled in
detail in a few thousand words especially
in an elementary way as i am trying to do
here

  the fact that the cow has split hoofs and
the horse has not if applied to freight-rates
in this article would fill this magazine
hence i omit much detail that while im-
portant in daily practise would not alter
but rather tend to confuse the subject for
the average layman this matter of con-
fusion is the very mistake ninety-nine out
of one hundred railroad writers make and
something i am trying even at the cost of
some exactness to avoid here besides the
man who knows all about railroad freight-
rates has not yet been born

  just how many elements enter into the
making of a freight-rate probably no man
knows i am sure i do not and i have
never met a man who did one thing is
sure distance alone is one of the least im-
portant items yet at first thought it might
seem to be the most important thing of all
more imporant than mere distance within
reasonable limits of course are terminals

the part a terminal plays

  it costs less to haul freight from the city
limits of chicago to those of new york
city than it does to move it through either
city a relatively short distance the reason
for this is that terminals cost hundreds of
millions of dollars those of the pennsyl-
vania and the new york central in new
york city including the tunnels under the
hudson river are an example of what ter-
minals cost compared to the relatively cheap
the a b c of

freight rates



construction between the two cities in
making a freight rate these terminal ex-
penses must be considered though the vary
greatly with each city

  chicago is so situated that it can have a
belt line railroad running around the city
connecting all the railroads that enter that
city while this arrangement is almost out
of the question in new york city this
 belt line  permits easy switching of a car
from one railroad to another say from the
northwestern to the new york central but
to switch the same car in new york city
from the new york central to the pennsyl-
vania costs much more in the end the
shipper or rather the consumer pays these
bills as he must and should

where the small towns suffer

  when one considers the vast difference in
physical conditions conditions no man can
change that exists between the terminals in
chicago and in new york city one cannot
complain if the railroad charges  for cer-
tain switching in chicago and say  for
practically the same service in new york
city this same question of terminals is
one of the roots at the bottom of the quarrel
between big and little cities over difference
in freight rates

  we will say that a man wants to ship
two mowing-machines from chicago one to
denver and another to littleton colorado
a small town -about ten miles to the south
of denver both machines going over the
santa fe which passes through littleton
when the train reaches littleton it must be
stopped and delayed perhaps half an hour
to properly switch out the car containing the
mowing-machine a delay which costs the
railroad at least  if not much more
counting interest on the money invested in
the cars engines the crews pay etc

  in other words the freight charge on that
one mowing-machine does not pay five cents
on the dollar that it costs the railroad to
stop its long freight-train and deliver the
machine at littleton

  hence in practise it pays better to take
both mowing-machines straight through to
denver break up the train and in a day
or two send one of the machines back ten
miles to littleton in a car loaded for little-
ton this car is so placed on a local train
that it is quickly and cheaply cut out and
dropped at littleton without delaying thirty
or forty other cars

  now this seems to be the common-sense
thing to do but when the railroad comes
to figure up its bill then the trouble begins
littleton is ten miles nearer chicago than
denver so according to some modes of rea-
soning-the abstract mileage basis-for
instance-the charge to littleton should be
less than to denver if the charge were
less then the shipper would order the ma-
chine put off at littleton but the rate to lit-
tleton via denver is made the same as to
denver and in some cases even cheaper than
from chicago to littleton direct

  this tends of course to build up den-
ver as a business center at the expense of
littleton and littleton objects giving many
figures some of which puzzle the wisest of
heads in case one place is much larger
than another and better situated there is
usually little real foundation for putting the
large and the small place on an equal basis
but if the two towns are nearly equal in
prospects though with yards maintained at
only one of them the other can show a
pretty clear case of discrimination

  the famous  spokane case considered
by the interstate commerce commission a
few years ago was somewhat along these
lines in this case seattle was the denver
and spokane the littleton of the example
we have quoted in the preceding paragraphs
the equally important  reno case  is
much on the same order

paying for the  back haul

  this condition of affairs is called the
back haul that is goods are pulled
through a town to a big terminal then back
over the same tracks to the town and the
local merchant is charged for the entire
haul the direct or through haul and
the  back haul

  take spokane as a sample say the rate
to seattle from chicago is  and the rate
from seattle to spokane over the same
tracks is fifty cents the charge from
chicago to spokane is then  now
it takes the disposition of a saint to stand
on the platform and see your goods roll by
to seattle then back to spokane and pay
for hauling them all this useless distance
when they might just as well be put off at
spokane

  so the goods were put off at spokane but
the bill is still  in other words the
railroad has charged you for hauling
the goods to seattle and back although it


the railroad mans magazine

has not hauled them one inch of this dis-
tance rank robbery again but what are
you going to do about it pass a law

  just what kind of a law please the
man who can properly word such a law
will make himself famous for before doing
so he must solve one of the hardest problems
in the actual operations of a railroad in
the case of spokane and seattle the two
places are each large enough to make them
more or less equal and the problem is tan-
gled but in the case of littleton and den-
ver as i have illustrated the same principle
appears in a much clearer manner

  if spokane is to have certain rights equal
to seattle then how about littleton hav-
ing the same rights as compared to denver
but if littleton has these equal rights then
how about the lack of great switch yards
at littleton one cannot build many side-
tracks and maintain a night-and-day signal
service at every little jerk-water station
where the freight in some cases will not
average one car a week

  now here are some of the actual physical
conditions under which a railroad operates
and how to adjust the bills to such con-
ditions constitutes the whole problem of
freight rates clearly the mileage basis
will not do and the joint cost system
seems to be full of weak spots while the
combination of the two systems simply
causes new problems to spring into life

  this brings us to the  zones or certain
sections of country under a blanket rate
and a blanket rate you will remember
is one where the charges from a collection
of shipping points are the same regardless
of conditions in the part of the united
states where the blankets are most used
that is from the atlantic seaboard to the
mississippi river and north of the ohio
river the territory is divided into different
 zones

  for instance say for the first hundred
miles out of new york the charge is one
dollar for the first two hundred miles the
charge is two dollars etc all the way to
the mississippi river

  now it is easily seen that such a system
of freight charges would divide the country
into zones according to the distance
from new york boston or any other at-
lantic seaboard city there would be the
 two-dollar zone for instance and the
three-dollar zone next to it the charge
to all cities in the two-dollar zone would be

two dollars and the charge to all cities in
the three-dollar zone would be three
dollars and so on

  all this looks very nice on paper and
even works fairly well in practise but how
about two cities near togedier say twenty
miles apart one in the eastern part of the
three-dollar zone and the other in the
western edge of the  two-dollar-zone 
here the two cities are only a short distance
apart yet the charge is one-half more to
one than to another this fifty per cent
difference in freight rates from the atlan-
tic seaboard spells ruin for the city in the
 three-dollar-zone because the city so near
it in the two-dollar-zone will sooner or
later run it out of business and reduce it
to a comparatively dead town

  now all this may seem merely abstract till
you own real estate in that  three-dollar-
zone city and your rent income drops
steadily every year this in fact is what
is happening every day to thousands of real
estate owners and the problem to them be-
comes a very live and important one in-
deed yet just how to adjust even this ques-
tion so that things will be right all the way
round we have not yet learned even the
supreme court of the united states does
not know and does not pretend to know

  the usual solution proposed by the
three-dollar-town is to demand the two-dol-
lar rate regardless of the fact that then the
town still farther west can on the same prin-
ciple demand the same two-dollar-rate and
so on till the last the  ten-dollar-zone is
reached of course this will not do for
then we would have a  flat  rate reaching
clear across the continent just like the
postage-stamp system

  this very postage-stamp system has even
been seriously proposed by some individuals
as a possible solution of the freight-rate
problem still it seems hardly right to
charge a man as much for shipping from
new york to albany as it does from new
york to los angeles the albany man
would find fault and give loud and long
utterance to that universal cry our rate
is too high

  i could so on for many pages giving one
detail after another of the problems that
confront the freight-rate man and through
him the nation for as i said in the be-
ginning this question of freight rates touches
swiftly and deeply every pocket in this
country though few persons realize it

the second article on the a b c of freight rates will appear in our next issue
lazy bill bentak

by s o conley

     had he not been such a tight-wad the
     kings treasury might have remained intact

king wore a crown made of
i iron band studded with
illiants the kings fore-
ad was low and avarice
d set its seal upon his face

            his nose shot out from his
profile like a hook used by sailors when
catching sharks it was a nose of active
mien and seemed ever ready to smell out
hidden money

  the ingenious limner who carved the
portrait of that venerable ruler upon the
everlasting granite that marks the entrance
to the province of gowat chiseled beneath
it the statement that king olfactuss name
had been given to him because of the pe-
culiar prominence of his olfactory organ

  the king was a miser and ordered a
stone-mason to build him a small pyramid
-a sort of stone purse wherein he could
lock up his untold wealth in those days
money was not loaned out at interest and
wall street was unheard of happily for the
simple-minded egyptians

  so the king had the pyramid built and
during the long weary winter nights he had
his hoards quietly carted to his treasury
one morning at breakfast while he was eat-
ing his oilsmeared fish and drinking his
wine the factotum reported that the deposit
had been completed and lo the key

  the king jumped from his seat at the
table and cried  my mare my mare
the desert 

  the slave bowed his black head and in
a few moments the neigh of the capari-
soned animal was heard at the gate

  the king mounted-he of the deep cop-
per-colored face he of the nose-and with
the speed of the wind he sped across the
plain a cloud of dust obscured the hori-
zon marking his trail but an instant after

the veil of the uplifted sand had been re-
moved no eye could discern the king for
he had entered his pyramid and his mare
was hitched in the shade at its base he
locked himself in and began to gloat over
his enormous and dazzling store

  diamonds rubies charmed bracelets an-
tique rings jewels worn by noah before
and after the flood together with his rich
drugs golden candlesticks pearl-headed
canes images in gold and silver crocodiles
with emerald eyes amber full of jet flies
silver lizards and bronze serpents miracu-
lously formed

  ali bentak the humble stone-mason who
built the pyramid lay on the bed in the
second floor front of his unpretentious
dwelling on salem thoroughfare egypt
his breath came feebly he was almost ash-
en in pallor the doctor who had been at-
tending him for weeks shook his perfumed
curls and waved an everlasting adieu

  the good old stone-mason was dying a
lingering illness was dragging him into the
realms of  the mystic beyond his widow-
to-be leaned over his couch she was a
hard-working woman and toil had given her
a sad countenance her left eye squinted
and was tearful her right eye was out and
therefore could do nothing

  two youths stood beside the bed of the
coming mummy they were his sons two
idle boys who had done nothing to earn a
living beyond holding horses and sweeping
the streets of their native city the stone-
mason having been the architect of the
kings treasury had nothing to leave his
children save a secret and a blessing

  what he had put up he philosophized
that also could he tear down and as his
bill for labor at one dollar and seventy-five
cents a day had not been paid by the king


the railroad mans magazine

he had no compunction of conscience he
beckoned to william c bentak his eldest
and laziest son to draw near

  i have a secret bill said the mason
 and before i die i want to tell it to you

    i built you know the pyramid for that
avaricious old fossil king olfactus he
has his treasure in it and goes there nightly
to see it

   when he leaves he locks the door and
puts his seal upon it so that any one get-
ting in will have to break the wax and the
king will find him out there are no win-
dows in the pyramid and therefore there
is but one way of entering and that is
through the door

  here old ali bentak gave a knowing look
at his son who winked away a tear and was
all attention

    perhaps there is another way of getting
into the strong box he continued and
perhaps there is a stone-mason who knows
it by the tail of the holy crocodile there
is four blocks up on the side fronting
east there is a stone that turns -on a pivot

  the eye of the holy ibis might search
in vain to find it but it is there touch it
where you see a rude and very small mark
that looks as if it had been made by the
slip of a chisel and-you can get in there
is a corresponding mark on the inside and
by pressing that you can get out

   finishing the thread of his discourse he
gave his bronze-colored soul to the protec-
tion of the holy crocodile and the holy ibis
and started for the domain of mummydom

  old ali bentak had been sewn into his
last shroud and placed in the front line of
the long ranks of mummies in the cata-
combs and his widow and sons looked
around them and bethought of the pyramid
as it was the work of the late lamented
head and guide of the family they felt
a natural pride in this monument to his
genius

  mrs ali bentak was too proud to take
in washing and too old to marry again so
she entered her right of dower to the secret
and suggested to her hopeful offsprings the
excitement that would attend a midnight
visit to the treasury department during the
day it was but natural that the sons of ali
bentak should walk around the pyramid
and admire the handiwork of the man who
had built it and while thus listlessly en-
gaged they easily discovered the mark made
by the chisel and they took note of it

  that night the bureau of mrs ali ben-

tak sparkled with a few rare stones of name-
less value and the dining-room displayed a
sumptuous supper

  frequent were the incursions made into
the hoards by those children of want aye
so frequent and so incursive were they that
the aged olfactus was bewildered  his
gods were leaving his heaven not singly
but in handfuls his coins were winging
their flight his crocodiles eyes had been
picked out and his mythology was orbless
even his coral eagle had lost its golden
front teeth

  where was this to end who was the
evil spirit who was to finish it and him
in vain lie searched with his hooked nose
among his chests and boxes in vain he
examined every corner of his mine no
red gnome or spirit-bat was found tucked
beneath a ruby or crouching in the shady
side of a diamond amazement filled the
king-despair the miser twofold emo-
tions took possession of the twofold man

  he had entered his treasury and as
usual the sacred seal of the kingdom was
unbroken he tapped on the walls it was
like striking a skull-a dead sound was the
only answer he appealed to the ibis the
bull the crocodile and all other sacred ani-
mals in egypts holy zoo that he had
been robbed and robbed vilely and the
worst of it was he could not discover the
robber

  why not take all the treasure away and
thwart the miscreant he thought why not
cast it far and wide over the lybian sands
that stretched southward and westward from
his regal home why not give it to the
cutpurses of the desert build churches to
the sacred birds and beasts crown his
queen with a diadem whose light would
make her dusky beauty shine like a star
over the dim mountains of the moon but
the old shylock of the nile left his great
wealth in the dark vault for its luster to
shine on the somber walls and cheer the
bandit in his foul success

  the king ate no supper that night and
next morning his breakfast left the table
untouched he mounted his trusty mare
and flew around the sacred depository of
his treasure no bird had lit upon the apex
of the edifice no serpent coiling through
the blazing sands had wriggled its way to
cool its scaly skin in the dark shadows of
the walls the wind from the lone lands
of africa had hidden the footsteps of the
masons sons and all was mystery and all
lazy bill bentak



was dim those sisters of seclusion silence
and safety reigned supreme

  a storm had gathered in the afric air
the day had fled and the night the rob-
bers friend was abroad in the land loud
howled the blast and the mysterious nile
chafed against her reed-fringed banks the
monstrous deities of her flood found safety
in their muddy shrine as they listened to
the rattling thunder of the skies

  all was gloom and darkness tempest and
terror and in the midst of it the broth-
ers once more left their home for their
egyptian el dorado the stone turned on
its pivot and they entered a torch was
lighted and stuck into the ground william
c bentak and his brother picked their way
in quest of the golden stores william lift-
ed from an open box a bracelet that was
worth a battle between nations his brother
was staring in hypnotic admiration at the
sparkling eyes of an ivory god

  hark there is a voice at the door
the wax is being broken  quick fly 

  it was the younger brother who spoke
both started to escape william was first
out of the secret passage and his brother
was following but the king was too fast
he had enteredjust in time to see a body
fall to the floor

  the gleam of a sword and the deed was
done william c bentak severed his
brothers head from its body and the secret
opening snapped closed he seized the gory
head and fled from the pyramid into the
sheltering seclusion of the stormy night

  he gloried in his freedom and in the
fact that he was outside of his brothers
tomb with his brothers head in his hand
he reveled in knowing that he had left the
king inside with the lifeless trunk and will-
iam c bentak ran on and on

  the king thought that he had made a
gallant capture but the lifeless headless
body before him only added to his misery
and chagrin he looked around and won-
dered whether he was in a dream or whether
the inmates of the sacred  zoo  had given
him into the hands of conjurers then it
dawned upon him that he had no time to
waste in thinking if he wanted to catch the
culprit

  he dragged the body out through the door
and onto the wet sands he reentered ex-
tinguished the torch locked the pyramid
and hastened back to his palace his pri-
vate guard was commanded to fetch the
headless body from the pyramid and then
 r r

the worried fretted frightened puzzled
king began to lay his plans for the morrow
wrapped in his dressing-gown and his
thoughts he drew a chair before the fire
and in it fell asleep

   william c bentak had cut off his broth-
ers head to save his own he believed that
the force of this argument would acquit him
of premeditated murder had both been
detected he soliloquized both would have
been destroyed and to prevent the secret
being discovered he had removed the only
evidence against himself-his brothers
speechless head

   the next morning the king was busy is-
suing an edict that edict commanded that
every inhabitant from the oldest to the
youngest of his city and the neighborhood
within a radius of one hundred miles
should pass before a gibbet on which was
to be exposed the body of the unfortunate
thief

   soldiers were placed near the gibbet whose
duty it was to scrutinize the face of every
person who passed to see if they could trace
any expression of recognition by ten
oclock the public square was crowded with
the dusky people they passed on won-
dering but not recognizing none knew
the masons son

   in egypt in those days death was looked
upon as a peculiar institution of nature and
great care was paid to the bodies of the de-
parted without burial they could not pass
that glorious gulf which separates mortality
from immortality an unattended mummy
was no mummy at all and was excluded
from that paradise where the highest enjoy-
ment is a full and social intercourse with
the crocodile the ibis and the bull

    you must bury your brother said mrs
ali bentak to bill

    how can i   asked the son

   you must bury your brother repeated
mrs bentak with seemingly unnecessary
vehemence  and she added  if you do
not i will tell old olfactus all about it

   william bentak left the room and pro-
ceeded to saddle his mothers mule in the
panniers of the impervious leather he poured
wine in the wine he poured a poisonous
opiate  in the saddle he deposited his per-
son and made his way toward the public
place the sun was setting  tower and
dome and steeple glowed in its ruddy splen-
dor and afar over the sands the wind be-
gan its mourning wail but onward in the
deepening twilight jogged the fratricide


the railroad mans magazine

  the people had obeyed in awe and si-
lence the dread mandate of the law and
had returned to their homes to talk over the
wonders of the affair the guard with
their white shawls folded over their heads
and armed with spears and heavy stone
hammers were grouped about the base of
the gibbet they were tired with the weary
and useless ordeal

  william bentak dismounted from his
mule and carelessly approached the group
he was the only civilian among the sol-
diery it was but an instants work to prick
a hole in one of the panniers and let the
wine flow out speedily it was observed by
the tired guardsmen they rushed to the
wine sacks-they filled the hollow of their
hands - they pressed their mouths to the
aperture-they laughed at the riders well-
affected grief and what was it to them
whose wine it was so long as they could
drink it

  the wine was not tardy in its potent ef-
fect through the brain through the mar-
row of the bones through the arteries of
the heart it flew like molten quicksilver
and worse than the arrows of the sand-
enveloped bedouin it killed the life within
them and one and all the captain and his
men were stretched upon the ground then
with all the dead about him in the thick
gloom of the evening william c bentak
tore his brothers body from the gibbet and
fled to the safety of his mothers house

  poor old olfactus his eyes turned so
red from weeping his famous nose so blue
from constant blowing and his step so totter-
ing that many thought he had begun a life
of dissipation his treasury invaded his
guards murdered the body rescued the cul-
prit fled and worse than all the secret of
the mysterious entrance to the pyramid un-
raveled 

  he could not understand why the croco-
dile the ibis and the bull had been so un-
kind to him he had acted like a king he
had been open and aboveboard and there
was no guile in any of his commands why
not change it all ha ha he would
be tricky and he would beguile he would
show the populace that in his old bald head
there were a few ideas worth knowing so
he feigned wonder and admiration for the
cleverness -of the mysteries and published a
brief exposition of his royal views and in-
tentions in which he said

be it known that i king olfactus under

the blessing of the great watc-r-god of the

  nile the crocodile and his brethren in holi-
  ness the ibis and the bull am willing to
  pardon the wonderful man who has robbed
  my coffers killed part of my brave and vic-
  torious army and robbed the gallows of its
  fruit

    not only do i pardon him but i invite
  him to come forward on the fourth day of
  the next moon and stand before my daughter
  the beautiful princess sopliina who will be
  present on that day beneath the palms in
  the golden hall of the whispers in my pal-
  ace of the silver peach and if he will re-
  count to her and prove that he is the person
  who performed the aforesaid wonders he
  shall have the hand of my daughter in mar-
  riage for his astounding and wonderful acts

  this was signed in the name of the croco-
dile and posted in the public square it
had a wonderful effect

 the princess sophina was beautiful
among women-lovely but not whiter than
the lotus of the nile-and heiress to the
large estates of the monarch day by day
the princes and peasants filed into the hall
of whispers to tell their gruesome concoct-
ed tales hope had inspired them with wit
and their tongues were eloquent but none
could account for the mystery of the
pyramid

  the princess sat in patience flowers of
infinite size and hue exhaled their loaded

eyes gazed upon her beauty two eyes that
seemed endowed with the expression of inex-

   those eyes read her heart read her brain
read her diplomacy for one instant they
wandered toward the shrubbery and a smile
played from the mouth to the eyebrow of the
mantle-covered stranger the princess was
seated in a regal chair the visitor stood di-
rectly in front of her they were alone
for he had waited until all had departed
baffled and disappointed

his silence

   i know all and did all  replied the
stranger

  ah then tell me

  she listened to the slow and deliberate
narrative wondering how so simple a thing
could have baffled the wisdom of her father
the narrator had just finished when she
too anxious to obey the secret orders of the
king hurried forth her hand to seize him
her fair mouth opening to call the guards
hidden behind the convenient shrubbery
he too extended his willing and unsuspi-
cious hand to receive hers she seized it

threw his coat aside he showed both his

a sleeping-car on an interurban line is
not an entirely new thing in this country
but such cars as are now being operated daily be-
tween peoria illinois and st louis missouri
are proving a boon to the traveler as well as some-
thing of a curiosity

  upon entering a compartment to prepare for
the nights rest one finds that the bed to be occu-
pied is folded snugly into the wall and that a
chair placed in a comfortable space is waiting for
the passenger

  if the upper berth is not sold it is not let down
which permits of standing upright if desired
when ready to retire the cot is drawn out from
the wall and if tall you will find to your great
relief that it is six inches longer than any berth
you have over occupied and permits of sketching
out to full length

  in the wall at the head of the bed is an elcctric
light which obtains its current from a storage

she looked at its withered flesh its shrunken
arm its almost rotting bones the guards
gathered around her they gazed in won-
der at the new demonstration from the land
of mysticism they pursued not the demon
that had just fled upon his wings of gloom
the king tottered into the chamber and de-
manded the person who was to be given over
to torture

daughter and the skeleton arm fell from
her grasp to the floor william c bentak

by sam henry

the true story series to think coolly and act quickly
while looking down the barrel of a revolver in the hands of a desperate
outlaw requires a nerve one seldom meets in the days run with the long
list of railroaders who have been killed by train-robbers in mind the engineer
who keeps his mouth shut and does as he is told under such circumstances can
justly feel that he has done all that could be expected of him engineer con-
verse did not believe in carrying firearms he did his part and did it well
pitting his wits against the train-robbers pistols and winning a fight which might
never have been won with bullets

true story number fifty-two

a train robbery that missed fire and ended in a bloodless victory for
the train crew through the quick wits of a
plucky throttle-handier

olonel your soldier comrade
certainly displayed wonderful
presence of mind your story
about him reminds me of an
incident in my railroad ex-
perience in which the main
actor was also a soldier having taken part
in our family row of the early sixties though
at the time of the exhibition of courage and
presence of mind of which i shall tell you
he was an engineer on a train called the
 cannon ball which the gould system in
the early eighties was running solid from
galveston texas to st louis missouri

 i was sorting mail on this train for
 uncle samuel  between houston and tex-

arkana leaving houston at  p m we
arrived at texarkana at  a m making
the three hundred and sixty-five miles in
sixteen hours stopping only at county seats
and junctions this train was the fastest in
texas at that time

  well i remember the engine-boys who
had the honor of pulling us one of them
was william converse he won the respect
of all his fellow railroad men as he used
the choicest language was always retiring
and never given to swagger if you saw
him arriving from his run his overalls
would still be neat and the tips of his white
collar always showed above a well-fitting
jumper

     pulling the throttle of engines since
  and an engineer on the i and g n
 between longview and galveston since
  he is to-day pulling no  and no

 	between longview and palestine still
 making schedule time on these fast trains

    but now to our story of the part this
 man played in an attempted train-robbery
 which occurred the latter part of septem-
 ber 

    ours was a fast through train and we
 were always believed to have lots of money
 aboard particularly in the fall or cotton
 season when the banks of houston and
 galveston shipped currency daily to the
 country banks to move the cotton crop the
 government must have realized that we ran
 some risk in consequence because they sup-
 plied us mail clerks with old army pistols
 as long as your arm with the warning how-
 ever that if they disappeared we should
 have them to pay for

didnt tote a gun

   mr converse was in my car at hous-
 ton one day getting a drink of water while
 i happened to be hiding my old army blun-
 derbuss under some sacks and seeing what
 i was doing he remarked that i evidently
 did not intend to use it if held up  no
 sir i replied  it is my opinion that when
 men get sufficiently desperate to hold up a
 train they value human life very little and
 i am not going to do anything that will
 give them an excuse to use me as a target

     he said that he also looked at the mat-
 ter as i did and therefore never carried a
 gun on his engine

     at our first station out spring twenty-
 three miles from houston where we had
 exchanged these remarks i heard the por-
 ter on the opposite side from the station
 shouting at some tramp as i thought to
 get off then i heard him say  all right
 boss and i looked out to see him trotting
 along ahead of a man with a pistol in his
 hand

     the train was moving off very slowly
 and they had no trouble climbing aboard
 the front end of my car then two more
  fellows came from behind lumber-piles
 alongside of the track and boarded the en-
 gine with pistols in their hands which they
 pointed at theengineer and fireman

   they ordered them to pull down to
 the san jacinto river bridge five miles
 away and stop with all the coaches on

the bridge except the mail and baggage
cars five of their pals they said were
waiting there who if tricked would kill
mr converse should it take twenty years
to do so

too much for the fireman

    after we got under good headway die
fellow who had the porter in tow on the
end of my car knocked him on the head
and pushed him off he then started to
climb up over the tender to join his pals in
the cab but coming over the tank he
slipped and fell headlong into the gang-
way of the engine accidentally discharging
his pistol the fireman covered by an-
other one of the robbers who had been try-
ing to frighten him by sticking his gun
into his face and telling him he didnt care
whether it went off or not had been press-
ing up into the cab window and was now
so startled that he went out backwards

    mr converse was also badly startled
he jammed on the air almost stopping
the train but the man covering him shoved
his pistol along his ear and commanded
him to go ahead mr converse asked if the
fireman had been killed and was informed
that he had caught the last sleeper

     i am sorry for your sake if thats
the case said mr converse  because you
know captain the state penitentiaries are
both on this road huntsville being only a
short distance away and the convict guards
are constantly traveling back and forth

the train was a fort

     they carried a hundred or more con-
victs to the state farm near houston yes-
terday to pick cotton and i saw eight of
these guards returning to-day get on our
train at houston all had shotguns and
side-arms and if that fireman caught the
train as you say he did the mail and bag-
gage cars are regular arsenals by this time
and some one will certainly be killed if you
attempt to carry this job through

   the robber lost his nerve pleaded with
him to save diem and threatened that if
they were hurt his pals would sooner or
later kill converse

     captain i have a plan said the en-
gineer  i will stop the train on the
bridge allowing only the pilot to reach the
bank you can then shout to your com-
rades in the brush to run for their lives


the railroad mans magazine

and then join them by climbing out over the
running-board and going down the track
keeping the engine between you and the
train so that the guards cannot get a shot
at you

  this plan evidently met with the rob-
bers approval for arriving at the bridge
their leader called to his pals in the brush
to run-that the train was a veritable fort

   they then took off down the track at
a speed which would have done credit to
a texas bronco firing back at the engine
to intimidate mr converse so that he
should not pull up and allow the guards
to give chase

  the truth of the matter is this with
the exception of the messengers old sawed-
off my army pistol and a  belonging to

a passenger there wasnt a thing on the
train that could have made powder smoke

  and the best of it is that we never
learned the story of how the robbers were
frightened away from mr converse at all
we got it from one of the robbers-from
the leader himself in fact-who was cap-
tured about five years later after doing a
similar job farther west in giving an ac-
count of the hold-up he said that he had
since learned how he had been tricked but
that mr converses story was so logical
and coolly told that at the time he had
not doubted a word

  if you knew mr converse as i do you
would agree with the robber who said of
him  that engineer was the nerviest fel-
low i ever saw  

balloon-power railroad

a railroad on which the motive power
is supplied by a balloon is certainly a
novelty such a railroad has been constructed in
austria under government supervision its object
is to carry passengers up and down iiochstaufen
mountain at bad reichenhall

  the top of this mountain affords a splendid
view but the climb to the summit is tedious and
uninteresting accordingly it was decided that
the tourists who visit the place would appreciate
the labors of the captive balloon devised to con-
vey them to the summit

  the balloon was made to run along a track built
at the side of the road-bed a trailer with many
wheels clasps this wooden rail or track and the
passenger-car is fastened to the trailer

  the operator sits in the car with a cord swing-
ing between him and the balloon by which he can

regulate the supply of gas safety devices are at
hand in case of accident

  before the car starts up the mountain the bal-
loon is charged with sufficient gas to enable it to
ascend to the summit and when the top is reached
and all is ready for the return journey some of the
gas is permitted to escape whereupon the car
starts down hill its speed being checked by the
retarding effect of the gas still left in the balloon

  it was not until the most rigorous investigations
had been made and the comparative safety of this
method of journeying demonstrated that permis-
sion was given to build the railroad there are
many novel safety devices to prevent accident

  the tank and generator from which the gas is
drawn answer the double purpose of supplying
power for the railway and furnishing gas for illu-
minating the town-chicago rccord-herald

pigeon acts as pilot

a blue pigeon with a peculiar fondness for
railroading for several months past has
been flying with the iron mountain trains be-
tween walco and gurdon arkansas a distance of
thirty-four miles the bird is known as the
 royal blue flier and it generally keeps just
ahead of the engine on a level with the head-
light stopping to rest when a station is reached

  for a long time the pigeon was regarded as a
bird of mystery for its origin was unknown and
it eluded all attempts to capture it not long
ago however it was finally made a prisoner by
special agent j m lambert while it was perched
on the headlight of engine  which had stopped
at witherspoon he succeeded in getting up to
the front of the locomotive and reaching around
the smokcstack grabbed the bird

  lambert shortly afterward discovered that its

owner was j w hall a resident of malvern who
took the pigeon home with him but lets it loose
that it may make its trips with the train

  on one trip engineer golleher who was in the
cab tried to overtake it but it was no use-the
pigeon always stayed just ahead when the train
stopped at arkadelphia for water the bird flew
out to one side and rested in a tree until the fire-
man rang his bell for the start when it resumed
its place just in front of the headlight flying at a
suitable speed to remain about the same distance
ahead whether the train was going slow or fast

  some of the trainmen are said to regard it as
a hoodoo and fear that its presence portends some
disaster to them but as yet no accident has hap-
pened to a crew while the bird was along others
look upon the pigeon as a pet and are always glad
to have it join them on a trip

regarded as exclusive then as mysterious

opened it only once an inch or so to hand
out his ticket just after the train had left
the windy city

  whenever the train stopped at a station

fromeyer noted that the window curtains
of stateroom a were drawn tight notwith-
standing the fact that it was on the shady
side of the car

  it was a chicago and alton tvlun
toward sunset it was within an hour of
st louis conductor fromeyer was think-
ing about the occupant of stateroom a

  there were seven or eight passengers in
the car in section  opposite the one in
which fromeyer was taking his ease sat a
young man fashionably dressed fro-
meyer watched the young man intently as

lie took a suit-case from under his seat
opened it rummaged among its contents
and finally took out a clean handkerchief

  the young man then closed the suit-case
and put it back under his seat mean-
time fromever noticed that the stenciled
initials on the suit-case were  j j w

   guess ill go to the diner and get a
bite while we run into st louis said j

j w to conductor fromeyer i open
there to-night-and ill save time by eating
now

  one of the profession asked fro-
meyer

  yes were playing at the olympic
theater he hastened forward to the
diner

  no sooner had the actor left the car than
something happened that greatly excited
fromeyers curiosity the door of state-
room a opened and the mysterious pas-
senger stepped out carrying a suit-case
he went directly to section  just vacated
by the actor and sat down placing his
suit-case on the seat in front of him

 not a regular occupant

  the man was unshaved his hair un-
kempt his clothes slouchv-not at all the
sort of person who usually occupied expen-
sive stateroom a

  looking across at the pullman conduc-
tor the man threw open his coat revealing
a badge

  im captain mcnaughton chief of po-
lice of hot springs arkansas he said to
fromeyer so kindly pay no attention
to what i am about to do im after a cer-
tain man you must neither see nor hear

  the man with the badge pulled from
under the seat the suit-case marked  j j
w he opened it took out a bath-robe
bath-slippers two shirts a bag of collars
and a tin box labeled make-up then
he opened his own suit-case and dumped
its contents in their entirety into the bag
marked j j w which he then restored 
to its place under the seat next he placed
in his own bag all the things he had re-
moved from the actors suit-case closed it
arose and carried it back to his stateroom
pausing on the way only long enough to
say to fromeyer

  mums the word conductor

  when the train pulled into the union
station at st louis the actor returned to
car  from the diner and said to the porter

  take my suit-case to the platform

please

  the porter did as requested then said
to the actor

   that bag o yourn is some hefty
boss seems like you was carryin a line
o hardware

it was some heavy

  no merely neckwear answered j
j w with a smile  here hailing a
station-porter put this bag on a cab

  after the station-porter had placed the
suit-case at the drivers feet on the cab he
turned to the actor and exclaimed

   gee but that bags got weight into it
mister

   whats the matter with all you por-
ters said j j w again smiling you
must be weaklings that bag is not heavy
at all then he called to the driver

  southern hotel

  when the cab pulled up at the southern
the bell-boy who came out and carried the
suit-case of the arriving guest to the desk
wiped the perspiration from his brow
though it was a cool day in november

  your bag is sure loaded with ore
the boy said to the actor after the latter
had registered himself as j t wilson
new york

   youre all crazy in st louis an-
swered wilson  heres my key num-
ber  carry that bag up for me

  in his room wilson hurriedly opened
his bag with the intention of putting on
some clean linen before going to the thea-
ter as he lifted the cover he stared in
dumb amazement

  only men of certain professions would
have recognized the contents of that bag
a newspaper man would have known in
a general way the nature of the imple-
ments

he had played burglar

  a detective or a policeman would have
been able to give each tool its name one
actor in ten might have been able to de-
fine the uses of those heavy objects

  j j wilson was the one actor in ten

  a burglars kit he exclaimed

  wilson had twice played the part of a
burglar in melodramas and he knew the
uses of the folding jimmy the rubber
gloves the electric lamp the squeezer
ten thousand miles by rail



and the  pitch  drills that were now re-
vealed to his astonished eyes as part of the
contents of his bag

   some ones playing a joke on me he
muttered maybe im cast to play bur-
glar again-and this is the work of some
manager who loves a practical joke and
yet-no it cant be whats the mystery
anyway supposing im caught with these
things in my possession its against the
law ill take them to the police right
away

  he emptied the bag of all else save the
burglars outfit then hurried with it to the
elevator as the elevator reached the lower
floor it jounced up and down a moment

looked at his watch it was a quarter to
eight

   hang the bag  he exclaimed  theres
no time just now to take it to the police
here boy take this bag up to 

  hastening across the street to the olym-
pic theater which is directly opposite the
southern hotel wilson entered his dress-
ing-room then suddenly cried

  by jove ive forgotten my make-up
dresser-oh dresser he called

  a tired seedy man thrust his head in at
the door

   go across the street to the southern
quick commanded wilson heres my
key go up to  and get my make-up

as elevators will in unskilled hands-and
the bag flew open

   jiminy cried the elevator-boy his
eyes bulging he winked at himself in the
elevator mirror as the actor hastily closed
the bag and stepped out of the car just
then too a bell-boy stepped up to wilson
saying

youre wanted at the telephone sir
the journey interrupted

  wilson hurried with his bag to the tele-
phone-booth where some one on the wire
invited him to come to a certain club after
the show that night to do a professional
 stunt

  as he came out of the booth wilson

kindly pay no attention to
what im about to do

box hurry make believe youre
going to a fire 

five minutes later the dresser reap-
peared the first thing he did was to
wink significantly at wilson

well wheres the make-up cried the
actor  ill be called in less than twenty
minutes hand the box over quick 

 i ransacked your room mr wilson
but i couldnt find your make-up box i
opened your suit-case during the search
and-

caught with the goods

  great guns man you found those
tools  

   yes sir thats all right i under-
stand youre cast to rehearse a burglars
part here in st louis

  never mind borrow make-up from
somebody be quick 

  after the play wilson went direct to the
club where he performed his professional
stunt and then returned to the south-
ern

  the clerk would like to speak to you
mr wilson said the bell-boy


the railroad mans magazine

  im to be pinched for having that kit
the actor thought

   mr wilson said the clerk when the
actor reached the desk a strange thing
has happened in your absence captain
mcnaughton chief of police of hot
springs-hes well known to us-called
and went up to your room and took pos-
session of certain tools-here the clerk
winked- that happened to be in your
suit-case he left word that if you want the
personal belongings missing from your bag
youre to come down to the union station

your bag is sure loaded with ore

before the rock island train pulls out for
hot springs at eight oclock in the morn-
ing

  more mystified than ever wilson went
up to his room and found surely enough
that some one had taken the burglars kit

  he was awake all night trying to make
a guess as to the meaning of the tools and
of the visit of the chief of police of hot
springs

he meets the detective

  the next morning wilson arrived at the
union station and hastened through one of

the gates to the rock island train that was
about to pull out for the southwest

  well here i am he told himself
but how the old harry am i to know
captain mcnaughton when i see him
just then a pullman conductor stepped
up to him saying

   you rode down with me from chicago
yesterday sir you occupied section 
and you carried a suit-case marked  j j
w all right chief turning-to a third
man this is the actor

    hope this thing hasnt caused you any
inconvenience mr wilson
said the stranger  a burglar
called  big joe  finlay took
liberties with your suit-case
yesterday in the pullman
hes wanted for robbing the
second national bank of
hot springs

  mr mcnaughton then in-
troduced himself

  i dont understand
said wilson whats the
game  

   just this finlay knew i
was after him his pals
passed him word through the
car window at one of the
stations on the way down
from chicago that i was
waiting to nab him at st
louis now finlay knew
that i could arrest him only
on suspicion he knew fur-
ther that to be caught with
that burglars kit would form
m o s t damaging evidence
against him so he con-
trived to get rid of the
tools by dumping them into
your bag

   but how and when did he do the
trick asked wilson

in the trap

   it was while you were in the diner
finlay came out of his stateroom showed
a fake badge to the pullman conductor
here-

    fromeyers my name put in the pull-
man conductor shaking hands with wil-
son

  yes ive fromeyer to thank for the
fact that i nabbed finlay and also his
suit-case containing your property said
ten thousand miles by rail



captain mcnaughton when i showed
up on the arrival of your train last eve-
ning and told fromeyer that i was after
a certain crook and described him fro-
meyer cried

    why thats the man in stateroom a
its all right cap hes in that room now
he hasnt come out yet youve got him
in a trap so he isnt a chief of police at
all but just a bank-robber 

    we then tried to open the stateroom door
but it was locked on the inside fromeyer
produced a key and we opened the door
but the prisoner had flown he had crawled
out of the window he left his suit-case
behind however-and here it is mr wil-
son take out what belongs to you

the lynx-eyed explains

   but how were you able to trace me to
the southern asked wilson

   easy enough replied captain mc-
naughton mr fromeyer remembered
that the initials on your suit-case were  j
j w we called up the various hotels
asking if any one with your initials had
registered and so found you

   but you say the bank-robber finlay
escaped by way of the window said wil-
son  yet you tell me you nabbed him
hows that

  yes we got him all right fromeyer
and i rushed into the station in the forlorn
hope that perhaps wed catch him passing
through we got as far as the cab-stand
when fromeyer suddenly cried

    there he is captain-the man get-
ting into that cab 

   a minute later i had my man good-
by mr wilson thank fromeyer for the
fact that you got rid of those burglars
tools so easily and that you recovered your
property im taking big joe finlay to
hot springs on this train tools and all

the would-be peacemaker

  a chicago and alton conductor out of
st louis related this story

   if ever a railroad man loved peace it was
thomas mooney the chicago and alton
station-agent at jerseyville illinois just
north of st louis tom mooney hated any-
thing resembling a row when the railroad
assigned him to jerseyville he was over-
joyed he had heard that jerseyville sim-
ply reeked with tranquillity tom mooney

liked to air his views on international peace
one day he said to a conductor ham
stone of the st louis local

   yes sir the day will come when the
profession of arms now regarded as hon-
orable will be deemed the most disgraceful
of callings

declaring war

  that same evening at ten oclock while
tom mooney was sitting in his office smo-
king his pipe of peace four young men en-
tered excitedly

  peering out through his ticket-window
the station - agent recognized four young
men of jerseyville headed by charlie
skates

  well get em here said one of the
quartet

  yes theyll come here to take the train
for their punk town alton said another

  just then tom mooney stepped out of
his office saying

   sounds like you are declaring war
against some one

  bet yer was the reply those four
alton fellers with curley maretta leadin
em to the bad have insulted us and the
town of jerseyville they say that jer-
seyville isnt on the map because were
some short of the fifteen thousand popula-
tion of alton and because were on a branch
line of the railroad while altons on the
main yes mooney they insulted us and
somebody started something and were not
through with em yet were layin for em
here

   you cant use this station for a battle-
field announced mooney authoritatively
 besides he added  why not settle your
row peacefully instead of punching those
fellows heads why not meet em like gents
and frame up a treaty of peace

  just then the four altonites entered and
one of the jerseyville men cried

  mooney you stay out of this

  the altonites certainly heard this warn-
ing yet one of them shouted

  so you jerseyvillians have got a reen-
forcement have you well you bet hell
stay out of this 

the fight is on

  with that one of the altonites seized a
framed time-table from the wall and
smashed it on the agents head

this of course started the worst row


the railroad man s magazine

ever known in tranquil jerseyville the
eight young warriors closed in and a ter-
rific hand-to-hand fight ensued

  no no cried the station-agent as he
wiped the blood from his face  dont
fight boys 

  he hurled himself into the melee to sep-
arate the combatants and received a blow
that sent him staggering across the room

  not content with hands for weapons the
warriors now grabbed various implements
of war such as the poker the coal-scuttle
the stove-shaker and a lantern one even
lifted off die door from the red-hot stow
and let it fly at the nearest of the foe an-
other produced a bowie and two of the
enemy were badly cut

  while using these weapons on one anoth-
er the battling champions of alton and
jerseyville herded against the stove they
knocked it over and the live coals set fire
to the building

  tom mooney wounded in a dozen places
found himself lying flat under a heavy over-
turned table which in the wrecking of the
station had been used as a battering-ram
to fell him

  one unkind warrior now proceeded to
jump on the table with both feet threaten-
ing to crush the life out of the man under-
neath

  at that critical moment two constables
burst into the room armed with pistols and
clubs all the combatants were imme-
diately made prisoners of war

mooney was well-creased

  when they lifted the table from mooney
however they heard the well-pressed and
well-creased station-agent saying in a weak
voice

   you cant take me a prisoner of war-
no sir im a non-combatant thats what

i	am i was merely trying to restore peace
when those fellers set upon me im the
flag of truce im the red cross

  in that case mooney said one of the
constables you can stay by the wreck
while we tote these prisoners off to the cala-
boose

    fire  shouted one of the prisoners re-
minding all that it would be a good thing
to get to work and save what little of the
station there was left

  all hands even the eight prisoners be-
gan fetching water and soon the flames
were extinguished having finished the ex-

  citing work of acting as a fire department
however some of the prisoners began edg-
ing away

   stand still  commanded the consta-
bles  the first man who tries to escape
gets shot

   the prisoners were marched off to jail

  the next morning mooney arrived at the
wrecked depot a mass of bandages and court
plaster

a real fighter now

   why mooney  exclaimed ham stone
the conductor of the morning local from st
louis as he entered the station to get his
orders you look like youd been in a fight
thought you were a rooter for international
peace

   i was mr stone replied mooney
wearily  but  aint no more why um-
pires at ball-games get better treatment than
peacemakers

  look at this station not a stick of
furniture left intact not even the cast-iron
stove and its colder to-day than the coast
of labrador and then-gaze on me i
say look--at me

    aint i a sight no sir i wont be an
advocate of international peace any longer
imgoing to resign my job and enlist in the
united states army soldiering is far more
peaceful than railroading

    but you cant enlist in the army pro-
tested ham stone  they wont have
you

  why

   because tom mooney this here busi-
ness of acting as peacemaker has caused you
to be disqualified physically now and for-
ever as a soldier in any army in the world
a soldier is a fighting-machine do you
think uncle sam wants a fighting-machine
thats been tinkered up in a repair-shop
not for a minute no 	-

in a barber-shop

  a buxom juliet sat in the waiting-room
of the union station st louis idling her
time until her romeo returned from the bar-
ber-shop

  the rise of the curtain shows the bar-
ber-shop with three men sprawled in three
chairs in the act of being shaved enter a
fourth customer keen of eye alert yet de-
liberate who in a single glance round the
shop seems to take in everything and every-
body
ten thousand miles by rail



  noticing that he will have to wait he sits
down and while pretending to read a news-
paper makes mental inventory of the facial
and physical features and the apparel of the
man in the chair nearest the door

  this observant man was one of the clev-
erest railroad detectives in st louis-bill
herren he had never failed to get his

  meantime he observed that the mans
trousers were ragged at the bottom and that
below the knee they were stained either by
blood or by chemicals

  when the man arose from the chair her-
ren took his place sitting in such a position
that in the mirror he could see every move
made by the red-headed man he noted

man he had caught so many train-rob-
bers through sheer luck that he was called
lucky herren

what herren saw

  herren noted that the man in the chair
nearest the door had just had his red hair
cropped close and that the barber was at
present separating him from his red beard
herren noted further that the man wore new
shoes

  that man is gradually getting cleaned
up like one who has suddenly found money
herren told himself

that the mans coat was faded as the man
took his hat from a peg the detective saw
that it was badly battered

  never mind the brush herren heard
the man say to the boy

  that man is now going to buy a new
suit after which he will patronize a hat-
ter mused herren

  the red-headed man having searched
his pockets for coin produced a few nickels
-not sufficient however to liquidate the
barbers bill

  suddenly after a swift look round the
shop he turned toward the wall shoved
his hand deep into his trousers-pocket


the railroad mans magazine

turned back and proffered a bill of large
denomination to the barber

couldnt change it

  the tonsorial boss said he would have to
go to die cigar-stand on the concourse to
get the bill changed and during the bar-
bers absence herren noticed that the red-
headed man acted nervously

  the barber returned and began counting
out the change but the customer stopped
the process saying

    oh thats all right

  at the same time he seized the bunch of
bills rammed diem into his pocket and
started for the door

  herren his face covered with ladier
jumped out of a chair

   just a moment my friend he said
stepping between the red head and the door
 if you havent urgent business elsewhere
id like a litde chat with you

  without making any answer the man
turned and rushed to the rear door-only
to find it locked in a flash then he turned
drew a six-shooter and let fly at herren

  the shot went wild and the detective
bounded at his man grasped the pistol with
one hand and began slowly choking his
prey with the other hand relendessly her-
rens fingers closed upon the mans throat
until he collapsed

  herren disarmed him handcuffed him
and when the man was again able to
breathe led him away to the four courts

  hanged if i know what hes wanted
for herren declared to the prison official
 but im reasonably certain hes wanted for
something hold him anyway for at-
tempted manslaughter

just knew he was wanted

   herren went to the office of the chief of
the wabash secret service in st louis and
said

   do you happen to want a man with red
hair a red beard a scar on the right cheek
the tip of his left trigger-finger missing and
a roll of bank-bills of big denomination on
his person  

  the secret-service chief thought a mo-
ment then exclaimed

  chi st lou

  herren sprang up staying i thought
so its chi st lou-wanted for that hold-
up of the express messenger on a train two

nights ago and for killing the messenger
ive got him-hes over in the four courts

now 

    whats he to say for himself  
nothing-except to ask me to take a
message to that girl thats waiting for him
in the union station waiting-room he
described her named her as nora tully
and asked me to give her his message

    well whats the message  

the interrupted wedding

  merely this  nora tully the wedding
is interrupted temporary 

  some days later herren again appeared
at the office of the chief of the wabash secret
service

   you can close diat chi st lou case on
your books hes dead said herren

   warden have to kill him   asked the
chief

no suicide cyanid of potassium
herren said the chief youre the
luckiest man on the force you first cap-
ture this train-robber by sheer accident
then your prisoner by poisoning himself
saves us the trouble of trying him did he
make any statement before shuffling off
 yes he asked us to search the cheap
hotels near the union station for nora
tully and give her his last message
well whats that message

  merely this  nora tully the wedding
is interrupted permanent 

gilpins lost mine

  charlie gilpin is not on the pay-roll of
any railroad yet he is a railroad man and
one of the most interesting of the boys at
the union station st louis charlie has
been manager of the union station cigar
company for nearly sixteen years if you
want to know about anything that has hap-
pened in the station at any -time in all the
sixteen years ask charlie

   gilpin is the hero of my tale-the tale of a
lost mine

   some lost mines exist only in a legendary
sense-but charlie gilpins is a sure-
enough really-truly lost mine its some-
where in the sierra madrcs in the state
of chihuahua mexico and some day gil-
pin may suddenly cry like monte cristo
 the world is mine 

  gilpin put up real money to outfit an
expedition to find that lost mine and the
ten thousand miles by rail



gold simply exudes from the wall of that mine

way he came to let the cash loose was some-
thing like this

  a negro named rastus warren in the em-
ploy of a certain county official in st louis
lay at deaths door with smallpox calling
in his employer rastus made this death-bed
confession

  he said that someyears before while in
batopilas mexico two greasers offered him
a job at their mine rastus accepted and
made a two days journey with a burro out-
fit over a trail so rocky and precipitous
that the mexicans called it el camino dia-
blo-the devils road

  rastus found the mine itself way down
in a deep gorge where it was so dark that
they had to work by the light of torches
gold simply exuded and oozed from the
walls of the chambers of that mine and the
three men merely had to pick it off with
their bare hands by day and hoard it in
their shack by night

the fortune vanishes

  once every three weeks rastus was sent
to batopilas for supplies on his return
from the last journey of the kind he found
the two mexicans murdered and their shack
burned their hoarded gold had van-
ished

  fearing that he would be held for the
double murder-if an investigation was
made and the bodies found-rastus started
for the rio grande carefully avoiding bato-
pilas on the way after terrible hardships
lie crossed the rio grande and found him-

self in brownsville texas he proceeded
to st louis and secured work with a county
official to whom after five years service
he made the death-bed confession here
given

  after making the confession however
rastus recovered his health in full much
to the delight of his employer who sug-
gested that the negro lead an expedition intd
the sierra madres to find the lost mine

what gilpin says

  capital was needed the county official
went down to the union station found
charlie gilpin sitting on his dais at his
cigar-stand and told him all about the
golden millions that were out of sight in the
lost mine

  the result of this confab was that gilpin
agreed to put up part of the money for an
expedition to mexico

  with gilpins cash plus the coin of sun-
dry other st louisans six men with ras-
tus as guide left st louis to cross the rio
grande and make a dash for the treasure at
the bottom of the gorge


the railroad mans magazine

 weeks passed and charlie gilpin had
made all sorts of preparations for starting
life anew as a millionaire when suddenly
he received a telegram from rastus warren
reading

    the five men deserted me the moment we
  struck el camino diablo leaving me without
  cash am stranded in chihuahua please
  send money for transportation and expenses
  home

  i had heard part of the story of charlie
gilpins lost mine on a previous visit to
st louis but did not learn all the details
until i arrived at the union station on the
present trip when i went to his cigar-

stand and asked his derk if the boss was
about the clerk called up to a round robust
and rubicund gentleman sitting aloft

   mr gilpin some one to see you
charlie gilpin descended from his
eery

  i introduced myself then said

  mr gilpin whats the present market
quotation on shares in the lost mine of the
sierra madres in the state of chihuahua
mexico on el camino diablo

now up to this time gilpin had looked
as pleasant as any photographer could wish
but now an expression of unutterable dis-
gust oerspread his countenance as he said
 have a cigar

             a few leaves from the biography of
             a boomer by his admiring friends

n to church to-morrow
bill inquired jack as
larry carrs crew settled
down in the old switch
shanty in the north yard to
wait for sixteen to show up
pop hickenlooper was on
sixteen that night and pop was a man of
too much spirit to allow his movements to
be dictated by an old time-card

  no i dont have to im immune ive
associated with railroad men for so long
ive got so tough that brimstone wouldnt
feeze me im going to stay at home and
pound my ear

  i havent been to church since i was -
first set up on the consolidated combina-
tion ruminated jack half to himself

 they gave me a corn-field sailor for head
man on my first trip his first crack out of
the box was a straddling switch which
blocked the main line and laid out the limit-
ed three hours since expressin my opin-
ion of mr sailors qualifications as a rail-
road man ive been ashamed to look a
preacher in the face

  speaking of language said bill re-
minds me of the winter i was firing for jim
fannum on the rebate route there had
been a blizzard that had tied up the road for
three days as soon as they got a snow-
plow through nothing would do hut they
must ship a lot of hogs from jay town al-
though a high wind was still blowing and it
was cold enough to freeze the hair off a brass
monkey	

  we were sent up light to get the hogs

by the time we were ready to start back it
was night and the wind was coming up
every minute some clever railroad man
had thoughtfully forgotten to set a brake on
 r r	

a box car that had been left standing on the
house track at reubenville

   the air was so full of fine gritty snow
we couldnt see that the wind had blown
this car down close enough to the main lme
to sidewipe our engine among other little
trifles we busted a valve-stem

   there we were in a young blizzard with
a lame engine and a trainload of hogs on
our hands fourteen loads was a full
train on a good rail up the reubenville hill
our conundrum was how to get eleven loads
up with an engine working one side and the
coal so full of snow that it was like turning
a hose into the fire-box to shovel it in

   but i managed to get her warmed up
finally and then we backed up and made a
run for the hill of course we stuck

double says jim to the head man

   aleck kupelo had picked up an old-time
rock off the q for head man that night he
was humped up over the boiler-head trying
to thaw out and shivering to think of what
was coming when she laid down

   he made some shocking remark or other
when jim spoke picked up his glim floun-
dered out and cut off behind six how we
ever got up the hill even with six cars
through the snow with an engine working
one side ill never tell you but we dw it

   the switch on the summit siding was
half a dozen car-lengths beyond the top of
the hill on a pretty stiff little down-grade
and being under the lee of the hill the snow
was drifting badly of course under such
circumstances nothing would do but she
must stop on the center

   the new brakey got out the pinch-bar
and grunted and clattered and slipped and
swore until he got her off the center when
jim gave her steam the wheels spun around


the railroad mans magazine

in die snow without taking hold and when
jim eased her she stopped on the center
again

   brakey pinched her over a second
time with exacdy the same result as before
by this time he was getting speechless but
he went at it once more

   by this time he was getting so mad he
didnt know what he was doing first
thing he knew he grabbed the frost pinch-
bar with his bare wet hand it stuck to the
bar instantly as if it had been glued

  well sir diat man let out a howl such
as ive never heard come from a human
throat before or since and followed it up
with a reglar cloudburst of such outrageous
language that die hogs in the head car
squealed and surged madly toward the back
end to get out of hearing

  that sounds like reddy flagg youre
describing

   sure that was his name dyou
know him

   know him everybody knew reddy
flagg he braked on every division from
new york to san francisco and switched
in every yard from st paul to galveston
reddy certainly did have the itching
foot always rode in the varnished cars
too

   yes he was an insinuating cuss and i
never heard of a conductor refusing him a
ride

   down on the indian valley road he
was known as  the-man-with-the-velvet-
touch a new man couldnt consider him-
self initiated until reddy had borrowed a
dollar of him permanent loan of course
 wonder what he ever did with his
money  

  spent it for dictionaries and bronchial
troches i guess give reddy an excuse to
say a word and youd get an artesian flow of
language in a voice that-well say-when
reddy was conversing in denver you could
hear him in omaha

  well youd have thought so if you
could have heard him that night we kept
pinching her off the center and twirling the
wheels around in the snow for half an hour
every time we didnt move em reddy
would hook his voice up another notch and
touch off a new cuss word

   when we tried shoveling the snow away
from the wheels it blew back just a little
faster than we could paw it out we couldnt
back them cars up that rise to save our im-
mortal souls so we did the next best and

went on down the hill to weed center
which was an ail-night telegraph station

    when we stopped at the station while
aleck went in to report instead of settin
his cars in on the side track or going inside
to get warm or otherwise conducting himself
like a civilized being reddy began prome-
nading up and down the platform cussin
everybody who ever had anything to do with
the rebate route from the aboriginal own-
ers of the right-of-way to the trainmaster
who had ordered us out

    there was a little runt of a deputy mar-
shal or night watchman or whatever you
call em who had just been put on the job
he imagined his nice new tin star was a
special license to butt in on all occasions
so up he trots to reddy and says says he

     say mister you ought to try to con-
trol your feelins if you was to get a piece
of that language cross-wise in your throat
it might choke you to death

    reddy let out a whoop and lunged at the
deputy who broke for tall timber with
reddy a close second i guess reddys chas-
ing him yet for he didnt show up again
that night and ive never seen him since

   of course you didnt see him again
such a night as that the deputy marshal
was an interposition of providence to lead
reddy out of the way of hard work no
fear of him sticking to the chase he never
stuck to nothing

   i was holding down the bind end for
billy train on local on the receivers snap
one fall when reddy floated into town and
i got him on ahead with billy said bill
 one day we were rawhiding at water
lake reddy was walking sidewise ahead
of a string of cars that was backing up try-
ing to get a crooked link into position to
make a coupling

    remember when  two cars with draw-
bars of the same make or the same height
from the ground were ever on the same road
at the same time every engine and ca-
boose had to carry half a car-load of assort-
ed links and crooked links and flat pins and
round pins and just pins and it took a spe-
cialist to make a coupling

  the road was new the siding wasnt
ballasted reddy got reckless and down he
went before you could bat your eye the
first car was upon him of course

   billy who was standing on the main
line watching him yelled at the engineer
and thrashed his arms around like a wind-
mill with the jim-jams signaling him to
reddy flaggs regrets



stop then he flopped down on the end of
a tie and covered his face with his hands to
shut out the ghastly sight

   old tom quadrant plugged his engine
but couldnt hold em quick enough to do
any good i was letting off brakes on the
cars we were getting hold of when i
heard billy yell and saw him flop down on
the end of the tie that way it made me feel
kind o sick for i guessed what was up but
i hoofed it back at my best gait

  when i reached the scene the cars had
come together and stopped i could see the
body lying between the rails when i tried
to speak my tongue was so numb i had to
make several efforts before i could utter a
sound

    reddy old boysays i  are you done
for 

  at that he rolled his head slowly till
i could see his face his eyes glittered like
a snakes when you have been poking it
with a stick-but he didnt say a word he
had fallen between the rails and had had
sense enough to lay down till they stopped

  he crawled out and felt himself over
with great deliberation

  there wasnt a scratch on him but his
coat-tail had been cut off about half-way up
his back he reached under the car and
drew out the amputated cloth still without
uttering a sound or even appearing to hear
the anxious questions of billy and myself

   he spread the coat-tail over his two
palms like a woman holding a pie-crust
and marched solemnly toward old tom
quadrant who was leaning out of his cab
window still looking blue around the gills
from the effect of thinking he had killed a
man

   reddy kept filling his lungs with air and
his mind with  indignation and swelling
out his chest at every step until he got his
face up within two feet of old toms then
he held up the coat-tail in his palms and
bellowed with all his force

    you infernal old wooden-headed
leather-jointed wind-broken misfit of a
plug-puller do you see what youve done 
that coat was too short already now ill
have to stand with my back to the sun all
winter to keep from freezing to death 

  remember the cactus and sagebrush
line that sticks out into wyoming like a sore
thumb   asked larry

  sure they started to build a road
somewhere but forgot where it was

  wrong reddy stopped the construc-

tion they were doing a land-office busi-
ness in track-laying on that line in 
there were two trains at the front a steel
train and a tie train and they were laying
about two miles of track a day half the
men were republicans and half democrats
and there was bad blood between them ow-
ing to the fact that there it was close to an
election

  reddy was braking for tom higbee on
the tie train the country was full of an-
telope every once in a while a herd of
the little rascals would come up on the crest
of a hill within a quarter of a mile of the
works and gaze at us until their curiosity
was satisfied then they would stick up their
heads and their stubby white tails and go
bouncing stiff-legged out of sight it was
enough to fire any mans sporting blood
and reddy decided one sunday that he
simply must go antelope-hunting

  reddy was the sort of marksman who
couldnt hit a barn if he was locked up in-
side of it in fact he had to stop and pon-
der to make sure which end of his gun he
ought to point at the game

  nobody would go with him for they
were all on to the quality of his sportsman-
ship so he borrowed a rifle from the en-
gineer of the steel train and started out
alone

    he kept to the tops of the ridges where
he could have a good view of the country
and whistled his loudest to keep from feel-
ing lonesome for about four hours he
paraded the prairies in this style without
bagging any antelopes

    then his whistle gave out and he began
to walk down-hill because it was easier un-
til he found himself in a coulee which hid
him from view thus he inadvertently ap-
proached so near a herd of antelope that he
caught a glimpse of a bunch of white tails
just tipping over a hilla mile away

    reddy sat down to lay out a plan of cam-
paign he was too tired to stand anyway
after harboring a suspicion for a few min-
utes that something was wrong with his an-
telope-stalking tactics he had an inspira-
tion

    he had heard that hunters on the plains
stuck up a little red flag on a stick and then
laid down near by and waited for the ante-
lope which are more curious than a woman
to come up to investigate when they could
be picked off at leisure he had no red
rag and no stick but he did have on a suit
of red underclothes now if an antelope
could work up a profound interest in a red


the railroad mans magazine

rag it stood to reason that the animal would
be simply entranced with a whole suit of
red

    reddy peeled off his outer duds cached
them in a cozy nook in the coulee and
marched off in his flaming undergarments
like the pillar of fire that led the israelites
out of bondage with his rifle at full cock
he was so lost in admiration of his own
clever scheme that he didnt notice that the
coulee opened into a little flat with a rank
growth of grass and that he was walking
straight into a herd of cattle which was
feeding there

  but a big bull did notice it and was
very properly shocked to see reddy appear
in the presence of the ladies of the herd in
such attire as soon as he could recover
from his astonishment mr bull said some-
thing which was the bovine equivalent for
 skiddoo  and then for fear the intruder
wouldnt beat it fast enough he put down
his head and stepped forward to see that
he went

   reddy forgot all about being tired he
threw the rifle as far as he could send it
and set out for camp as if he were going
somewhere for something and was afraid it
would all be gone before he got there

  fortunately for him he had been trav-
eling in a circle aad was not more than a
mile from camp the angels who are al-
ways around to take care of those who are
incapable of attending to the job themselves
turned his face in the right direction

   reddy didnt take time to side-step cac-
tus-beds or anything like that he took a
header or two got scratched and bruised
and everj- step he took the more scared he
grew in fact the more he thought of it
the more certain he became that he could feel
the maddened animals hot breath fanning
his neck as it strained to gain the one step
more that would enable it to plunge its sharp
horns into his gizzard

   but he didnt feel anything of the sort
for the bull and a bunch of steers which
had followed to see what the row was had
only kept up the chase to the top of the hill
where they all stopped and stood there ga-
zing after reddy and wondering what in
thunder the fellow was in such a hurry
about

  reddy was pretty far gone when he
reached the front end of the boarding train
hi- breathing sounded like the exhaust of
an engine that needed her packing-rings set
out

   he laid a course for higbees caboose
along the track beside the boarding cars
right through groups of republicans who
were lolling about in the shade smoking
sleeping sewing and jabbering ran through
a card-game upset a couple of men scared
another into fits and plowed on toward the
irish end of the boarding train

  naturally reddys headlong career
caused some excitement the republicans
shouted and jabbered and all jumped up
while some ran after reddy to find out what
on earth was the matter with him the
democrats heard the tumult and seeing a
man who looked as if he had just passed
through a hard winter running for his life
with a lot of republican sympathizers fol-
lowing him they jumped at the conclusion
that the republicans were trying to murder
a democrat that was enough

   the democrats raised a war-whoop and
seizing picks shovels spike-mauls crow-
bars and whatever else was handy fell upon
the republicans who were chasing reddy
and drove them back to their own end of
the train in another moment there was
one grand mix-up without any one know-
ing what it was about

  reddy couldnt speak for five minutes
after he reached higbees caboose and by
that time there wasnt any one to listen to
him for all hands had turned out to try to
stop the fracas-or to get into it there
were too many old scores to even up though
and once they were at it those fellows
didnt care what started the rumpus they
just swatted one another all around over the
landscape until the whole outfit was knock-
ed out or tired out

  next day there werent men enough fit
for duty to make up the gangs and the sur-
vivors were so hostile it wasnt safe to get
em together anyway the contractor fired
a few as a warning to the rest that made
some more mad and they quit aqd others
went back down the line to get their heads
sewed up and forgot to come back the
firt thing the contractor knew he didnt
have men enough to run a hand-car

   after reddy had paid for the gun he
threw away and had bought clothes to re-
place the ones he cached in the coulee and
couldnt find again he concluded that the
air at that altitude didnt agree with him so
he pulled his freight that was the last i
ever saw of him

 progress and a piece of news

  sgklaxo and graham had many more
wpl talks in periods of idleness be-
rriy tween crushes from his former
cell-mate and from the others
-a s graham learned to the utter-
most detail all the minutize of
yegg lore the language of the trade its his-
tory and its stringent moral code the ordi-
nary box-man he found out is usually an
ex-mechanic or artisan

  he learned that yeggs always operate
in gangs for the most part known by the
leaders name as chi jacks mob or
pitts whiteys mob their true names
are never asked or given but are replaced
by monicas derived from some personal
peculiarity or from the place of origin he
grew wise in reading their records on sta-
tions or water-tanks such marks as long
ed  e or  bb  s
came to convey much information to him

  he learned that the highest yegg virtue
is fidelity its basest crime treason a
bawl-out or a lek he found was
always punished by death sometimes they
told him a mob would have to wait years
to get a beefer who turned them up
but eventually the traitor always got a
leaden pill that sent him up the escape for
keeps

  the elaborate system of giving up or
greasing for protection by the police
he came to understand he discovered
where die proceeds of breaks almost in-
variably went-to the race-track or the
roulette-wheel on the principle of easy
come easy go very many yeggs he found

began in the octobcr railroad mans



olit were addicted to  coffin varnish
white-line and doctor hall that is
to say bad liquor which usually finished
them

  from their conversation he learned of the
ferocious sentences dealt out to yeggs when
caught and of how the policy reacted by
making yeggs never hesitate about killing
if cornered he learned all about  mooch-
ers and punk-kids and town plugs
who spy out the land in advance of a raid
about the use of phoney union cards to
insure freedom from molestation on freight-
trains or elsewhere and about endless ap-
paratus used in different circumstances-
endless methods too about which a fair-
sized book could be written he heard
many tales of fights resulting from the divi-
sion of the spoils and by way of contrast
came to know all about the collection of
 fall-money  and the liberality of yeggs
when asked to chip in for the hiring of a
 mouthpiece  to  spring  a friend in
trouble

  ciphers of a score of kinds he learned to
read and write the art of disguises be-
came for him an open secret wise he
became in methods for distracting the at-
tention of the bulls and misleading them
wise in lampblacking a key and by the
scratches on it reading the nature of the
lock wise in using the jimmy and in enter-
ing tight places he learned that a man
can always get into a place which will let
his head and extended arm pass and that
before going in it is always necessary to
be sure one can come out again

  under pianos careful tuition he learned
to read the inner structure of a combination
by die different sounds produced in turning
the dial so acute and sensitive did his

magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans- magazine

ear become that he could tell at what num-
bers the tumblers dropped into place he
grew to love their fine metallic sounds his
keen senses and delicate fingers attuned
themselves tc the work

  no wagner could thrill him no bee-
thoven set him dreaming so potently as that
slight and all but imperceptible click-chink-
tink that his instructor taught him to un-
derstand and to divine the meaning of
once or twice he had the chance of actu-
ally opening while out on a  hike a safe-
door by this species of manipulation it
fascinated and enthralled him

  the odiers were delighted adam proph-
esied great things for him and piano was
frankly radiant not even the jealousy
which deep down in his heart the teacher
already had begun to feel could stifle his
pride in having brought into the mob so
splendid an intelligence so deft a hand

  the crushes were only incidents after
all in a rather leisurely and luxurious ex-
istence much of the time graham read
and studied all his former friends and
acquaintances he carefully avoided where
he had vanished to none of them knew-or
seemed to care sometimes of an evening
he walked abroad with piano in strange
parts of the city he visited the  ink-pots 
of low-class members of his own trade
filthy dives usually run by an ex-yegg and
patronized by unkempt petermen

  on park row pell and doyer streets
he found a number of such places some-
times he dropped in to a  drum  where
stale beer and vitriolic whisky were sold
at two and three cents a glass again he
went the rounds of some of the  doss-
houses-bare and cheerless dens with a
whitewashed pot-bellied stove in the center
of the room recruiting signs and three-cent
lunch-room ads on the walls and discour-
aging wrecks of men lolling on the hard
wooden benches reading last weeks paper

  he came to know dozens and scores of
curious types the existence of which he had
never even suspected when a member of
the upper-world whole strata of society
opened out before his eyes strata with their
own conventions and standards of conduct
their traditions laws virtues and vices as
real complex and binding as those of so-
called respectability through and through
he came to learn the under-world from
gorillas to  scratchmen and from
super-twisters to mission stiffs

  some of the braver and cleverer ones
he respected some who sneaked and de-
frauded who as political heelers were  in
right or who acted as  fixers  and pro-
fessional go-betweens lamasters or pro-
fessional straw-bail men he despised
there were all sorts he saw in the world
below as in the world above

  one of the favorite diversions of his mob
was to see in the different papers the morn-
ing after a break the varying accounts given
by imaginative reporters and sensational
headline-writers to read that a dozen
desperadoes had swooped down upon a
town held it up at the point of automatic
revolvers blown the safe to atoms and de-
camped with crackling volleys pleased
them immensely for the truth usually was
as quiet and unobtrusive as they could pos-
sibly make it there was a little pepper
in the work once in a while to be sure but
not once that summer did any of the gang
take any bodily harm graham came to
believe that the fine old-time epics of crush-
ing were things irrevocably of the past

  next morning at breakfast while read-
ing an account of the  desperate pitched
battle between townspeople and masked
banditti piano came across an item that
made him start and frown

  he marked the place with his nail and
handed it across the table to graham

  graham his heart beginning to thump
read as at a glance

discovery

controlling by a mighty effort of
his giant will the strong emotion that
possessed him graham laid the paper down
carelessly enough shoved back his chair got
up and walked into the smoking-room at the
the steeled conscience



front of the flat the look he gave piano
bade him follow

  when they were together and the door
quietly closed graham seized the others
arm he thought a singular light was play-
ing in his companions eyes an odd smile
lurking about his mouth but this was now
no time for close analysis

  so then said graham with keen ex-
citement

  piano laughed easily  i guess you
know what that means said he

   means   repeated graham  why it
-it means that the old mans conscience has
been troubling him no not that-he hasnt
got any his bump of caution rather he
must have known for some time now that
my bits done and ended and that im at
liberty i dont doubt my disappearance
from the ranks of respectability has been
duly communicated to him so then-

    oh hes worried all right enough wor-
ried sure as guns but it isnt that i was
thinking about its nothing to us or to
you whats bothering him youve got
something of a bother yourself seems to me
hell be here now inside of fourteen days
yes two weeks from now things will be
settled one way or another hows your
nerve bo  

  graham laughed uneasily

  i guess its all right its got to be
i wish it was only a question of fierve down
there on spring street but from what
youve told me itll take more than just
that

  right you are fact is the nearer we
come to this thing the worse it looks give
me a tool-steel mountain and let me get at
it and ill guarantee to crack it plumb in
two but that crib there fixed as it is-
well-

  he drew a pencil from his pocket and
on the fly-leaf of a  history of the italian
renaissance that adam had been reading
rapidly sketched out a plan

    here you see he explained  is spring
street theres the courtyard in back
every window has electric alarms so that
if a single bar is cut a whole drove of bulls
will come stampeding no use trying to get
in that way absolutely out of the question

  the big door is worse he tapped
with his pencil on the plan  electric-
light post right in front of it you remem-
ber hopeless even in the dark a three-
hours job even without the alarms noth-
ing doing

  how about the roof asked graham

eagerly

  two skylights barred alarm at-
tachments fact is my boy it looks in-
fernally awkward all round ive been sort
of putting it off putting it off thinking that
maybe something would suggest itself to me
or to you it didnt look so ugly three
months ago just the general idea was fine
and dandy but now coming right bang up
against the immediate necessity of doing it
why- he ended with a shake of his head

  how about it inside asked graham
 youve already told me about the armor-
plate and concrete but just where is the-
the room you know

  sixth floor answered piano to-
ward the back-so

  he drew a floor-plan with square marks
for the elevator-wells a long corridor lead-
ing from side to side of the building and
several transverse ones opening out toward
the courtyard

    here said he touching a certain spot
with his pencil  i feel that if we could
only get a few moments interview with that
door right there wed be going some the
safe inside-thats a mere detail its get-
ting at it that bothers me that and the
knowledge that its got to be done c q d
not an altogether lovely layout now is it 
graham did not answer but leaving
piano still looking at the plan put on his
hat and went out they did not see him
again till late that afternoon

  his objective-point was the public li-
brary at fifth avenue and forty-second
street all the way dovvn-town as he sat
in a corner of the clattering l car ab-
sorbed in thought his mind was a tumult
of hopes fears plans speculations intri-
cate and seemingly unanswerable questions
first rose to his consideration the fact that
dill was coming back was even now on the
steamer plowing up the mediterranean to-
ward gibraltar and new york

   that once landed the old mans probable
first act would be to withdraw the packet
from its hiding-place even though he might
leave his other goods or valuables at the
warehouse and put it-where graham
knew not all that he knew was that be-
fore dill should have time to carry out what
was undoubtedly his plan the final coup
must be put through all must be risked on
this one cast of the dice the success or fail-
ure of his whole life must be staked his
liberty his happiness perhaps his very


the railroad mans magazine

existence must be pitted against this one
supreme effort which he knew baffled even
piano himself with years of training back
of him

  he thought of agnes had she he won-
dered changed much in those four years
which had so altered him did she still
think of him remember him believe in
him  or had dill been able quite to poison
her against him that too remained un-
solved in his mind he must wait he knew
and only on condition of success in this im-
minent undertaking could he ever hope to
approach her again with the proofs of his
first innocence the justification of all that
had taken place since his unspeakably iniq-
uitous sentence

  the warehouse came into his thoughts
he despaired at memory of that massive
stem gray solidity the type and picture of
property entrenched and defiant-property
however got however heaped together
something new he understood would have
to come into play some ruse some subter-
fuge some fresh principle if he were ever
to penetrate that fortress and take back the
thing which was his	-

  but what shall it be what how
he feverishly asked himself pressing a hand
over his eyes

  the forcing of that door supposing the
possibility of ever reaching it would have
to be done quite silently he knew in a
place of that sort where doubtless half a
dozen watchmen were perpetually on guard
and where quick escape would be out of the
question the work could never be under-
taken with nitroglycerin there was no
way of bringing electricity into play as at
reading yet - if there were only some
method of developing an equal heat some
noiseless way by chemical means then part
of the puzzle at least would become clearer

  the question he had asked himself be-
fore recurred to him vaguely he recalled
having once read-just where he could not
say - a dry theoretical discussion of the
properties of a certain iron compound which
when mixed with some other metal might
under certain circumstances produce a very
great heat

  what was it now what was it he
fiercely asked himself cudgeling his brains
in vain for the exact formula so intense
was his thought that his fae became set in
a savage scowl he noticed that two or
three people were looking at him and over
him came the guilty feeling that his true

occupation must be known to others-a feel-
ing which he never could quite rid himself
of even though reason told him he was safer
and more perfectly hidden in new york
than lie could have been in the most remote
village with an effort he looked out of the
window at the dingy second stories the bal-
conies and clothes-lines of manhattan

  no use getting a hot box over it just
yet he assured himself once i lay
hands on a good up-to-date chemistry man-
ual perhaps ill get on the track of the
infernal thing but that even that wont
solve the other riddle of how to get into the
place at all 

  on and on racketed the train it stopped
started swung round curves and sped its
way at forty-second street graham got
out

  now for the library said he

  an hour later found him at a broad table
half-buried with books on chemistry prac-
tical and impractical analytical synthet-
ical commercial heaven knows what not
one after another he searched them
through while an attendant brought more
and still more books and wondering
stacked them in front of this singularly ear-
nest young scientist with the mobile nervous
hands the pointed beard and the keen clear
eyes

  at last after more than two hours pa-
tient hunting he ran his quarry to earth
he gasped with exultation as a paragraph
leaped from the page of a french brochure
at him

  found it by jove he cried slapping
the table with his palm so forcibly that the
attendant frowned and coughed his disap-
proval

  again he read the paragraph translating
half aloud as he did so

    this substance known as thermit pos-
  sesses very peculiar properties it is a sim-
  ple grayish-blue compound of powdered
  aluminum and sesqui-oxid of iron when
  ignited with magnesium tape it burns quick-
  ly producing a temperature almost if not quite
  as high as that of electric arc itself

  for a moment he sat there as though half
dazed trying to let the possibilities of this
discovery filter through his brain then as
its full portent dawned on him his eyes
sparkled his chest expanded with a deep
breath his head came up defiantly he
closed the brochure thanked the attendant
and took his departure leaving the dry-as-
dusty fellow in as great astonishment as
it was possible for him to feel
the steeled conscience



   piano too was astonished when graham
 reached the flat burst into the smoking-
 room flung his hat on the table and cried
  ive got it 

     got it have you   queried the other
 looking up from his paper got what
 measles 

-- no no dont you understand an-
 swered graham too excited even to notice
 the jest  got the solution of the secret
 got the whole thing planned from a to
 z wheres adam he added lowering
 his voice

   where are the others

   out go on lets have it nobody
 here but us

    good i-i hardly like to let them in
 on any part of this until i know how its
 going to work see here i got it made up
 for me at the hooper-jordan laboratories
 he drew from his pocket a small paste-
 board box set it on the table which he
 cleared by the very simple expedient of
 shoving half the papers onto the floor and
 removed the cover with nervous fingers in-
 side a fine blue-gray powder appeared

   there it is cried he while piano
 stared in amazement

     there what is  

   why-dont you see the stuff i was
 looking for thermit

   oh come come ejaculated piano
  how do you expect me to understand you
 think im a mind-reader whats the-
 thats not all interrupted graham
  coming up on the train the whole thing
 dawned on me-not in its details you
 know those can be worked out later but
 the idea the main idea came to me in a
 flash so he snapped his fingers now
 then-

   you see here commanded piano
  calm down count out the pill-prattle
 and get down to first principles if i
 didnt know what a well-balanced head
 youve really got id think youd gone
 suddenly pipes above the ears now take
 off your collar and shoes get into slippers
 like me light the long pipe and lets have
 things straight you hear me no no i
 wont listen to a word till you get ready to
 do this thing right 

   graham found piano inexorable so had
 to obey

     this stuff you say is what   queried
 piano and what will it do

    its thermit explained graham nam-
 ing its chemical constituents in a few words

as for what itll do-well-ill show you
in a minute

  he reached over onto the table took up a
large flat paper-weight  which dave had
made out of a piece of some long-since shat-
tered safe rnd set it in front of piano then
he spilled from the box about a tablespoon-
ful of the metallic powder onto the middle
of the piece of steel he took from his pock-
et a bit of tape such as photographers use
for igniting flashlights and poked one end
of it into the little pile

  now well see if the scientists are right
or wrong said he fishing for a match
 of course even if it works right it wont
help us get into the security no its for
use inside but well get in all right
enough it all came to me-

  hold on cried piano one thing
at a time match eh here he struck
one shall i light it

   go on go on  exclaimed graham
more and more agitated let her go
piano calmly touched the flame to the
end of the tape the magnesium flared
then suddenly the powder took fire

  dazzlingly it burned with a slight crack-
ling sound yet almost without smoke the
heat that glared out at them made both men
shrink back and shield their eyes they
saw the steel redden whiten then go soft
and liquid boil up and disappear the
powder suddenly went out where it had
been their scorched sight beheld a clean-
edged opening down through the plate but
they had little time to stare at it for a
smell of scorching wood came to their nos-
trils then little tongues of flame began to
flicker up from around the edges of the
steel

  quick water cried piano these
papers-theyll all be going in a minute
he beat at the fire with his naked hands
while graham rushed water in a pitcher
with a tremendous hissing and smoking the
fire was put out and the piece of steel
cooled down but the table was an ugly
sight its varnish ruined a deep charred
patch burned deep down into the wood

  oi oi vat vill hixer adam say
exclaimed piano with mock grief then in
his own voice no matter whats a
table what are ten hundred tables side of
this

  he whacked graham enthusiastically on
the back graham coughed and blinked

  all right eh cried he shell do
business  


the railroad mans magazine

  will she jubilated piano oh my
-switch youre one genius no mistake
he seized the younger man by the hand and
wrung it till he winced sure as guns
he ejaculated sure as guns-krupps
siege guns mortars 

  graham laughed

  whos excited now he jibed mali-
ciously  my dear fellow sit down will
you light your pipe and listen if i
didnt know what a well-balanced head-
 there now thats enough  said pi-
ano quieting down  here just let me
brush some of this dirt off and lay a paper
over it so adam wont see it all at once
and im with you now then

  he sat down graham pocketed the re-
mainder of the thermit and sat down too

  my idea he began in its main gen-
eral outlines is like this-

  piano leaned forward listening intently
from time to time putting in a word or a
suggestion but for the most part letting
graham do all the talking

  for an hour they held council daves
arrival put an end to it but already the plan
was well matured

  nothing remained now they both felt
but to undertake the practical carrying out
of grahams ingenious inspiration

chapter xviii

preparation

p raham went down-town to spring
street next morning and dropped in
at the office of the warehouse he asked
the clerk to quote him rates on the storage
of two large crates of porcelain

  not in a vault you understand of
course he said merely in one of your
storage rooms one dollar a month you
say  for both  

  per crate answered the clerk shoving
his pen behind his ear and looking out with
mild colorless eyes through the grating

  too high objected graham i can
get a rate of half that in the united safety
yes but we guarantee against fire
water burglars and breakage that
amounts you see to insurance as well as
storage

   oh in that case graham returned
 its quite satisfactory itll do the
good will be sent in some time next thurs-
day

  the clerk nodded took down a large

flat book interleaved with carbon paper
and asking a few questions filled out the
necessary contract

  he passed it out to graham original
and copy graham read t over carefully
then signed in a bold firm hand  h k
everett 

  payable -in advance suggested the
clerk  one month at least

   heres for three said graham he
shoved in six dollars and the copyfolded
up and pocketed the original and took his
leave the clerk suspecting nothing went
back to his ledger and thought no more of
the incident which was like a dozen or a
score of others in his daily experience

  piano meanwhile had been hiring a
small disused carpenter shop on east eigh-
ty-ninth street close to the river neither
he nor graham dared trust the making of
the packing-cases to any hands but theirs
the very special manner of construction
they felt must attract attention and might
arouse suspicious interest

   next day tuesday garbed like workmen
they took possession of the shop-a dingy
cobwebby old place stored with consider-
able lumber and sufficient tools for their
purpose they had already told dave
that  something was doing though just
what they said could not be for the pres- -
ent divulged and had enlisted his services
dave was a good driver they knew he
could attend to the trucking of the cases
when ready from eighty-ninth street to
spring street

  tuesday afternoon they started making
the cases tumbler was out of town adam
was engaged in carrying on some further
experiments with the thermit which had so
delighted and astounded him that he had
quite forgotten to complain about the
scorched table or even his  history of the
renaissance that had been singed every-
thing favored the two conspirators were
jubilant

    i tell you switch said piano as he
peeled his coat rolled up his sleeves and
began hauling out planks from the pile at
the back of the shop i tell you this taste
of honest labor does me good its been a
long time since ive had a saw or a plane
in my hands quite an agreeable change
from a double-purchase wrench a  drag 
or a  puffmg-rod  you think four feet
by five will be big enough  

   maybe for one of them for yours
answered graham wed better make
the steeled conscience



mine about five by six im pretty long
you know

  long you are bo assented the other
on brains as well as carcass suit your-
self graham thought a tinge of pique
had crept into pianos voice but he could
not be sure piano went on casually
enough wed better have plenty of room
to turn around in rather too much than
too little well have a pretty long while off
and on to spend inside em i dont know
what youre planning but as for me i
take a little lunch and something wet
itll be a mighty tedious wait

  thus talking planning the last details
of the attack they set to work on the boxes
by mid-afternoon they had constructed two
large and solid cases of ample size loose-
ly built with considerable cracks between
the boards and lined with gunny-sacking
there would be no danger of suffocation
inside of each case they nailed a soap-box
to serve as a seat and also as a storage place
for tools provisions and the like

  the lids they made in such a fashion as to
give the appearance of being solidly nailed
down this they accomplished by using
nails cut off to the length of half an inch
and by fitting hinges to the covers inside
these could be readily screwed fast or un-
screwed from within

  there said graham at last straight-
ening up and wiping the sweat from his
forehead x guess theyll do now

  do well rather beauties arent
they if ali baba and hismob had only
thought of something like this instead of
their dinky old wine-jars things might have
come out differently for them eh now
youjust mark em switch and theyre done
ill let you do the brush-work-its in your
line 

  he laughed at the innuendo graham
smiled too as with a brush and a pot of
marking-ink he proceeded to give the final
air of verisimilitude

  when he had finished his work each case
was lettered in strictly professional style

  they both stood back surveyed the ef-
fect and pronounced it good

  nothing more to do now said gra-
ham with a sigh of satisfaction nothing
but to get some more of the powder and a
little clay then turn ourselves into freight
and sit steady for results this thing is
on the knees of the gods now for fair
if-

   if it doesnt slip off and smash things
will be didding right away quick piano
took up his speech well come on bo
its getting late we ought to be getting
back home what do you say if we take in
a good show to-night by way of celebra-
tion im dog-tired a workingmans life
is the life for me-not 

  graham smiled absent-mindedly his
thoughts were all in the near future now
so heavy with possibilities of utter failure
of capture of renewed imprisonment and
suffering or of dazzling success the real-
ization of all his hopes justification and
perfect happiness-which was it to be

  they padlocked the old shop door and
like the weary toil-stained men they were
slowly started through the fading light for
home

  piano talked more than was his wont
all the way but graham was unusually
silent the close approach of the supreme
trial weighed upon his soul

   how will this end   he thought with
alternating hope and fear  merciful
heaven if i only knew-if i could only
see

al the goal

c o perfect was daves make-up as a team-
 ster with overalls rough cap clay
pipe and all that the cleverest fiy-cop on
the slinkerton force could not have suspect-
ed either him or the true nature of the two
big crates in the truck which he drove slow-
ly down second avenue a little after four
oclock that thursday aftenoon

  without mishap of any kind he piloted
his pair of percherons along the streams of
traffic now and then he pulled up for a
car a blockade or the raised white glove of
a harness-bull once or twice he vitup-
erated a careless driver he smoked lolled
with bent back on the broad leathern strap
that served for a seat and played his whole
part to a nicety safely he brought his
team into spring street to the warehouse
and backed up at the freight-elevator


the railroad mans magazine

  it was just before the closing hour when
he arrived

  aw come on come on you growled
the elevator-man impatiently  what dyou
tink dis is an all-night bank

  dave only removed his cap took from it
a piece of paper read it slowly-scratching
his head the while - and then looked up
half stupidly

  security storage said he two
cases of crockrv sixth floor here and
he extended the contract to the ill-humored
employee

   all right shove em in  exclaimed the
latter  gee but youre the original bone-
head barry though 

  dave grinned

   gimme a hand   he answered climb-
ing up into the truck easy now-
e-e-easv hey wot you doin cant you
read naw you dont dey goes in right-
side up or dey dont go at all see an
you dont use dat hook neither

  the elevator-man swore

   hey bill  he shouted into the cavern-
ous dark behind him come git aholt
here will you

  bill appeared the three men carried
first one case then the other onto the broad
floor of the elevator

  all right now said bill

  dave extended the contract to him bill
scribbled a couple of crude initials dave
put the paper back in his cap straddled
into hteseat picked up the reins and with
an indifferent cluck-cluck drove away

  as he did so the elevator vanished slowly
upward and the big iron-bound doors
swung shut

  toward midnight faint signs of life be-
lan to manifest themselves in the larger
box there in the darkness of the storage-
room a slight sound became audible hard-
ly more than the nibbling of a mouse it
came from the slow gentle turning of the
-crews that held the hinges the screws
did not squeak for graham had nabbed
them with soap before having driven them
home

  one by one he withdrew them piano
in the other case was also now at work
hardly had graham finished and lifted
his cover when the lid of the other box rose
also

  s-s-s-st came an all but inaudible
signal it was answered then out
crawled graham

  he stood there a minute listening intent-

ly not a sign not a sound to indicate dan-
ger something clicked and the bright lit-
tle beam of the electric flash fell on piano
half-way out of his hiding-place

  douse it whispered piano the
light faded

  by sense of touch alone they took from
the cases all the material they would need
for the break-the keister with the clay the
sectional jimmy the package of thermit the
magnesium tape the revolvers and the
skeleton-key

  now let the covers down said gra-
ham so thats right if anybody
should happen to butt in here everything
must look all right

  correct answered piano with a
little luck well be back inside now in less
than an hour half an hour maybe then
nothing to do but wait for morning dave
wont fail us hell come back with his
story of a mistake being made-hell take
us out of limbo all right enough never you
fear

  as he spoke graham was already mov-
ing on noiseless felt-shod feet toward the
door which even by the momentary flicker
of the light he had made out piano carry-
ing the satchel followed him

  strangely enough graham was now cool-
er than his comrade although anticipa-
tion of this moment had set his nerves
a-tingle and keyed up his pulse now that
the actual time had come now that he was
within the fortress on the same floor with
dills storage-vault he found himself as
well at ease as though sitting quietly in the
flat reading a paper it had been the same
at the time of his trial the verdict had
overwhelmed him the sentence itself had
left him unmoved calmly die played the
light over the door

  nothing hard about this judged he
 only a simple lock no combination

  no need of any for a room like this
added piano getting out the skeleton-key
they arent wasting em on chinaware and
such but just wait till we strike the other
place down the corridor

  he fitted the key to the lock manipu-
lated it a moment without noise then turned
it the bolt slid

  cinch breathed piano as he picked
up the tool-satchel

  graham extinguished the light soundless-
ly opened the door stuck his head out into
the hallway and listened

  nothing no sounds of any sort came to
the steeled conscience



him no echoing footfall no gleam noth-
ing save silence absolute blackness so dense
that the hand was utterly invisible six
inches from the face

   come on  he indicated by a tug at
pianos sleeve together they slipped out
into the tiled corridor graham shut the
door behind them lest any watchman find
it open and investigate

-	though neither of them had ever so much
as been inside the vast building before they
both knew the way as accurately as though
it had been their home for years pianos
previous consultation of the architects
plans-a consultation made in the guise of
a chicago contractor-had put them in pos-
session of every detail and every distance

  forty-seven feet straight ahead gra-
ham remembered as in complete silence
they paced down the hallway then the
turn to the right twenty-four feet brings
us to the open space in front of the eleva-
tors that communicate with the courtyard
cross that and go straight on same corri-
dor thirty-six feet second door to the
right then another turn and first door
left

  almost as quickly as he had thought it
they reached the first turn along the
branch hall they passed almost unbreath-
ing guided by their sense of touch against
the reenforced concrete walls now they
were hard by the elevators  a pipe 
whispered piano with jubilation

  all at once he swore under his breath
yet angrily stooped and rubbed his shin
which had been  barked  by some hard
substance came a slide and rattle a box
fell noisily to the floor some late consign-
ment had been left by the warehousemen
standing in front of the elevators into it
piano had run

  now for trouble he said ought
to have used the light more darn the luck 

  graham pressed the button by the faint
gleam they saw the elevator-doors and a pile
of crates and barrels that more than half
filled the hallway

  suddenly from somewhere sounded a
footstep then at the juncture of the
branch and the main corridors a very dim
light began to show

 s-h-h-h quick there graham
breathed pointing over beyond the pile an
instant later revolvers in hand he and
piano were concealed

  none too soon for now the footsteps
sounded nearer then the light strengthened

it shone out suddenly as a watchman came
around the corner they could see the un-
steady lantern-beams dancing along the fire-
brick ceiling

  both of them held their breath the
watchman a keen-looking gray-haired fel-
low in jeans stood still for a long minute
listening he swung his lantern over the
pile of freight one sound one slightest
movement would have betrayed them gra-
hams finger tautened on the trigger

  for the first time in his life he felt the
killing impulse not the wrong that dill
had done him not even the many and griev-
ous provocations given him in the peniten-
tiary had ever stirred this feeling as now
the watchmans life hung in the balance
never had he been nearer death than just
that moment as he stood there half suspi-
cious half angry surveying the consign-
ment

  then he saw the box that had fallen it
explained or seemed to the noise that he
had heard he set his lantern down shoved
the box back out of the way grumbled a
bit and swore then with some half-mut-
tered word about  reportin that dugan to
the boss in the marnin sure  he took a
final look and departed his light faded
and died his footsteps echoed dimin-
ished ceased silence reigned again-si-
lence and the darkness

  graham and piano did not move or speak
they crouched there a full five minutes be-
fore they so much as dared draw a natural
breath who could tell but what the watch-
man might still be listening but what this
might be a ruse on his part to detect the
true cause of the trouble no novices they
to be so easily entrapped if trap there were

  but as the time lengthened and no sound
reached them they gained confidence once
more piano nudged his comrade and cau-
tiously stood up graham followed they
pocketed their  smoking-irons present-
ly they were sliding like wraiths down the
corridor beyond the elevators

  as they went graham kept his hand
trailing along the wall to the right he
counted the doors one two his
pace slackened even more they reached
the corner and turned again

   here  said he taking piano by the
coat

  both stopped piano set down the sat-
chel knelt and opened it graham threw
the light on the iron door that was all which
now separated him from dills place of fan-


the railroad mans magazine

cied security he saw the combination
then above it a second lock

  like many another vault it had two
fastenings one which could be opened only
by an employee one by the tenant thus ab-
solutely shutting out any unauthorized open-
ing of the door- or so they think  re-
flected graham smiling satirically well
maybe wellshow them a new wrinkle eh

  already he was at work piano handed
him the clay he took a lump of it stuck
it against die door immediately below the
combination and fashioned it quickly into
a sort of shallow trough the same opera-
tion he repeated for the upper lock the
rest of the clay he dropped back into the
bag

  taking the package of thermit he poured
into both cups of clay a quantity of the mar-
velous compound he inserted the bits of
tape which had already been cut to the
right length

  stand back now he whispered to
piano

  both men waited a moment looking lis-
tening

   go on-set her off  said piano

  a match flared in the black by its wa-
vering light their faces became visible set
and eager with eyes the pupils of which
were unnaturally dilated like a cats eyes at
night piano blinked but grahams gaze
was steady as his hand

  he touched the match to one tape then
the other there flashed a quick and blind-
ing radiance followed by the blue and
slightly crackling glare of the thermit then
to the floor dripped splashing an ardent
rain of molten steel

  piano looked anxiously over his shoulder
but graham merely smiling stood there
and watched the wondrous flame eat into
the door slight chance he knew that the
light should be twice or thrice reflected so
as to reach the main corridor with in-
credible rapidity the combination fused lost
form ran down and dribbled along the
plates of steel graham threw in another
handful of the stuff the metal rain in-
creased then where the lock had been a
tiny hole appeared

  it widened to a white-hot gap graham
closed his eyes which felt as though seared
a green light seemed to fill them he stood
there listening to the coruscating hiss of the
thermit no sweeter music in all his life
had ever reached his ears

  all right-all right whispered piano

  graham looked again the stuff had
burned itself out now nothing was visible
but just two glowing apertures like red-hot
windows in the dark

   when she cools a bit  said graham

  piano tiptoed to the turn looked and lis-
tened perceived no sign of danger and came
back

   oh but youre the goods bo  breathed
he in admiration

  s-h-h-h the jimmy now graham
answered oblivious to all but the immediate
task before them

  a few strong skilful twists broke down
the last barriers of resistance the door
swung inward

  piano seized the bag they both entered
the room graham pushed the door shut
behind him

   at last  he said coldly

chapter xx
the finding-and after

tte stood motionless for a second or two
a a flashing the electric beam here there
getting his bearings he sniffed the close
and fetid air of the long-closed place as
though it had been perfume his quick
glance showed him the situation of things

  the room he saw was very small-
hardly six feet by eight one side was
banked up with boxes and packing-cases
probably containing the old mans most
valuable books or art treasures some large
flat objects wrapped in sacking stood
against the wall directly opposite the door-
pictures no doubt grahrm turned impa-
tiently from these

  well queried he nothing but
junk here after all 

  there answered piano pointing to-
ward the right

  graham turned the light that way it
flicked spots of brilliance from metal

  graham saw a safe-door apparently built
solidly into the wall itself

   there she is switch   said piano ex-
ultantly now for business 

  graham stepped over to the safe to-
gether he and piano quickly inspected it
graham smiled

   i guess we shant have to waste any
more good ammunition on that decided
he just you keep watch a minute and
ill see what i can do with this pretty little
gopher
the steeled conscience



  piano took the light from him graham
knelt before the combination lovingly he
laid his ear against the steel plates like
a maestro touching a long-familiar instru-
ment he delicately took hold with his sen-
sitive artistic fingers upon the knob pfjhe
device

  he turned it slowly carefully listening
all the while thrice round he sent it then
thrice back noting each tiny sound for-
gotten seemed to be the perilous situation
forgotten the presence of his companion
forgotten even the object of his quest all
his attention keen and absolute centered
upon the minute fine hardly perceptible
little indications there within the combina-
tion

  at last he nodded

   ive got it he announced

  he spun the knob stopped it at  drew
it back to  then whirled it twice round
to  he brought it

  sixty now and-you see

  the action suited the words the com-
bination clicked graham pulled down the
handle tugged a little at the door and
swung it wide

  piano said nothing his eyes narrowed
though as he stood looking down at gra-
hams broad back in them that strange
look had appeared once more-the look
that graham had sometimes noticed there
as though the man grahams one-time
teacher harbored some secret jealousy or
some more poignant feeling but of this
graham knew nothing it passed too for
the moment in pianos growing eagerness

   one more and were in remarked
graham tapping the smaller inside door

   dont waste time figuring on that said
piano  its nothing but an a b c lock
here

  he took the light in his left hand with
his right he drew from the satchel the skele-
ton-key graham noticed that the key shook
a little as piano fitted it into the lock he
wondered momentarily at this but had no
time to give it more than passing thought
for already the inner door was giving way

  piano dropped the key back into the bag
and pulled the door it yielded dills
secret hiding-place stood open wide at last
before grahams searching eyes

  for a minute he did not see the thing he
sought in the drawer lay many papers
the sealed packet that piano had told him
about was hard to distinguish he knelt
there head bent slightly forward hands

eager to grasp a singular expression on his
fine intelligent face the color a trifle height-
ened in his cheeks

    eh dont see it asked piano breath-
lessly

  for all answer graham began taking out
the contents of the drawer

  there were deeds mortgages bonds
stocks-ah  what was that  a bulky pack-
age wrapped in manila paper and tied with
lawyers tape the knots of which lay buried
under seals of dark-red wax

  graham laughed a slight cynical laugh
if piano had expected him to taste the cop-
per of excitement to jump up to indulge in
jubilation he was disappointed with
hardly more emotion than as if finding a
bunch of newspaper clippings graham took
back his own took back his property the
justification of all that he had done his
proof the thing which was to give him once
more all that was to him far more precious
more dear than life itself

  justice piano heard him say only
that one word as he slid the bundle into
his breast-pocket then without rising from
his knees began carefully laying the other
papers back into the drawer again

  piano stared at him amazed the yeggs
jaw dropped he frowned with astonished
displeasure

   say switch  he whispered in an eager
trembling voice

    well  

   what-what the devil-

  you mean-

  those papers securities of all kinds
worth-

   i dont know that its any particular
concern of mine what theyre worth is it
answered graham closing the drawer and
making as though to swing the outer safe-
door shut

   piano laid a hand on his arm staying it

  maybe not maybe you dont care 
do

  why

  why theres swag to the value of
half a million perhaps and you-you ask
why what are you handing me

  piano could hardly articulate so great
had become his excitement and indignation
graham only laughed again

   so thats what you let me think this
thing out for is it he questioned
 thats why you let me solve a problem that
was too hard for you  not for the sake of
justice-not for the right of the thing-only


the railroad mans magazine

for a haul took me in taught me frater-
nized with me- he broke short off

  piano shoved his face close up to gra-
hams the rays of the flash-lamp reflect-
ed from the wall of glazed brick made only
a dim twilight yet there was light enough
for graham to see how ugly the others ex-
pression had become how bitter angry and
covetous

  it was as though all die jealousies the
half-perceived antagonisms of the past
months had suddenly crystallized had now
in a second been made visible

  hop-talk sneered piano trying
to play the parson all of a sudden now are
you think i risked my skin for nothing
but to see you get yours  where do i fit  
oh if its money thats bothering you
i guess ill have enough before long so that
i can pay you for your time  grahams
tone was so caustic and so stinging that
piano reddened

  drop that he answered it isnt
yours im after its the rest there inside
i want it you understand  

   sorry because you cant have it-you
see

    cant eh   and piano thrust grahams
arm aside why cant i

  largely because i say so not one
dollar of it not one cent you hear i
didnt plan this crush for loot planned it
for nothing but-

   i know all about that but you and i
are two different persons youve got yours
now im going to get mine stand off 
no

   switch said piano holding his rage
with an effort  see here youll let me at
that gopher or i think therell be a muss
in just about one minute

  i tiiink so too answered graham
cheerfully  half a minute maybe
piano his anger now wholly out of hand
cursed graham and struck at him gra-
ham caught his wrist in a grip like that of a
vise and held it

   fool  he exclaimed  what kind of a
place is this to raise a row in

  thick-walled enough i guess so no-
bodyll butt in panted the yegg you
going to let me at that box

  no

  piano threw a muscular leg round gra-
hams and tried to trip him

  they clenched staggered stumbled over
the valise and fell with piano on top
the light went out in the utter dark

graham felt the mans hands striving to get
a hold on his throat

  but piano in attacking him had reck-
oned without his host graham though ten
or fifteen pounds lighter was twice the ath-
jetgjhat piano even in his best days had
ever been

   the yeggs fingers could not find a hold
with one arm graham guarded his throat
and with the other dealt stunning blows upon
the mans head and neck his fist landed

savagely

  piano grunted trying in vain to guard
and at the same time to inflict some damage
the tide of battle turned

  with a supreme effort graham broke
pianos grip flung him aside and staggered
up piano clutched at him graham des-
perate kicked at him full force-the only
time in his whole life that he had been
forced by gutter-fighting methods to reply
in kind

   he felt his boot strike crushingly heard
a cry got free and leaped away

  half dazed by the sudden attack the
darkness and the violence of the struggle
he stood there a moment pulling himself to-
gether he heard pianos labored breath
heard the man groan and swear then al-
though he could see nothing knew by the
sounds that his opponent was getting up
again

   well had enough   graham gasped

  pianos only answer was a growl in-
spiration flashed to graham he dropped
to his knees felt here and there with his
hands gropingly found the valise then the
electric lamp	-

   curse you  he heard piano say
 what are you up to now wait till i get
a-

   the voice broke off

  graham heard a sound he knew right
well-the click of a revolver-hammer going
up

  even then singularly enough he felt no
fear but rather a wild sprt of exultation
a keen joy in battle with no light to guide
pianos aim the chances he knew were
good for escape even should the now mad-
dened man venture to shoot guided by
pianos breathing graham crawled away
crouching and on one hand the other
hand clutched to his breast the satchel into
which he had slipped the flash-lamp and
which contained the skeleton-key

stick and slug he remembered the
motto but now when his comrade had bro-


the steeled conscience



ken the pact had set upon him and was
even threatening his life he felt all the
bonds of the underworld code were utterly
severed

  answering no word then but reaching
the safe-door he pushed it and spun the
knob

  as he did so piano wholly out of the
bounds of caution with rage fired

  the report almost deafened graham in
that small and confined space the stab
of flame from the heavy - calibered pistol
singed his hair by its instantaneous light
he got a glimpse of piano crouched between
him and die door leading into the hall

  before piano had had time to pull trig-
ger again graham had rushed in on him
smitten him furiously upon the head with
the heavy tool-bag and floored him

  then waiting for nothing else he sprang
to the exit seized the still warm door and
pulled it open

  somewhere in the great dark labyrinth
of the warehouse he heard steps echoing
then a bell rang his heart leaped the
alarm he knew had been given

  yet even then when every second was
more precious than gold he could not desert
his former comrade without a last appeal

  he turned back and peering into the
gloom exclaimed

   theyre on come hike here-the
doors here ill wait for you

  no answer save a snarl and the click of
the revolver-again

  graham realizing at last the futility of
trying to reason with the infuriated yegg
said well good-by then on your own
head be it

  he drew the iron door shut down the
corridor he silently ran

  as he crossed the transverse hall where
the elevators were he saw lights at its fur-
ther end-lights and three men

  he heard a shout there he goes

  graham knew that he had been seen
that he was trapped there in the dark mazes
of a place stronger more formidable than
a penitentiary itself

chapter xxi
the leap

across his mind flashed clearly as 
though it had been outlined in flame
the plan of the warehouse which he had so
often and so carefully studied

    rr

  as he ran along the dark corridor with
the sounds of pursuit growing rapidly
louder nearer he saw the exact situation
the hall he knew extended some forty
feet toward the rear of the building then
a turn to the left would bring him to a
series of stairways that connected all the
floors

  up these stairs if he could only throw
his pursuers off the trail he could reach the
top story the skylights he believed of-
fered at least the chance of getting out onto
the roof once there- he did not know
yet since that was the only possible ave-
nue of escape he bent all his energies
upon it

  just before the watchmen debouched at a
run into the hallway where he was he
reached the turn

  a barred window twenty feet away let
in a few filtering rays of light grahams
eyes accustomed now to the gloom vaguely
perceived the iron stairway

  as with instinctive knowledge he felt that
his pursuers would all but inevitably con-
clude that lie had gone up if they did not
see him when they arrived therefore fol-
lowing the dictates of that instinct rather
than of his reason he hastily and noiselessly
slipped down the stair beneath the ascend-
ing one

  hardly had he reached the floor below
when he heard excited voices there above
him

  where is he which way up of
course you solid ivory

  he recognized one of the voices as that
of the watchman who had threatened to re-
port dugan  in the marnin in spite of
his imminent peril and throbbing heart he
had to smile

   guess i sized up your mentality all
right enough my friends thought he

  a moment he waited then sure enough
feet sounded on the upward stair

  graham kept utterly still all his senses
seemed as though merged and centered just
in the one sense of hearing to him came
disjointed fragments of speech as the men
stajing together through an irresistible feel-
ing of dread searched the corridors above

  they came back to the stairway puz-
zled he heard one of them say well he
cant git out nohow another answered
wait now till i ring up th rest of em
well have the bunch here in no time oh
he cant dodge us long 

  somewhere in the stillness an electric bell
s

the railroad mans magazine

trilled then on the stairs above he
heard the mens feet climbing higher still

  a daring ruse occurred to graham he
issued from the corner where he had taken
refuge and as the men went on up-stairs
he followed them

  the windows all up and down the stair-
way helped him greatly he neither hesi-
tated nor stumbled he made no slightest
sound yet steadily and swiftly he mount-
ed the stairs in the gloom blessing the
thick felt-sole shoes he wore

  on the sixth floor he paused-the floor
which but a minute or two past he had
quitted and where the watchmen had so
recently stood consulting to his mind
came the idea of seeking refuge among the
piles of freight out by the elevators but
this plan he at once abandoned those
boxes he knew could at best give him but
very brief respite if he hid there he must
surely be caught

  in this momentous game of hide-and-seek
upon which all his future all his life de-
pended he must at all hazards keep clear
and free of entanglements even a dozen
watchmen he lit certain could not suffice
to entrap him in those many dark and
winding hallways if he could only outwit
them until he could reach the top floor-
but after that who could say he set his
jaw and vowed that once there nothing
should stop him forgotten was his scorched
head where pianos shot had grazed

  now the watchmen were climbing again
again he followed this brought him to
the seventh floor while they were poking
about on die eighth but now he heard
sounds below him reenforcements were
coming suddenly a shot cracked sounds
of a scuffle burst out

  up from below rose a voice of command
you big stiffs here you what you
doin we got him shouts followed
came another shot a howl an oath

  graham fully realizing what had hap-
pened shrank back into the hallway cor-
responding to the one leading down there
below from the vault to the stairs

  he heard feet running rapidly down clat-
tering heavily in confusion the watchmen
reached the floor where he was concealed
for a moment his heart stopped still not
five yards from him the searchers were
suppose they should happen to come
through the passage where he stood all
open and defenseless but no-on they
went on and down the stairs again

  graham realized with a thrill of exulta-
tion that now all the men were below him
now nothing intervened between him and
the top floor thanks to the stupidity of
the men themselves and the diversion caused
by their finding piano his way stood clear

   dom funny how we missed im-how
he got down there agin when i seen him
wid me own eyes runnin up he heard
one of the descending watchmen exclaim
he did not wait for more but quickly stole
away up ever up still with the precious
packet safely in his keeping still with the
satchel gripped in his right hand his
pistol he did not draw but kept that for
extreme emergencies

  it took him but a few minutes to attain
the upper story of the tremendous building
as he went the light though still very dim
kept growing a bit stronger it served him
passably well inasmuch as he did not yet
dare to use the electric flash he thanked
fate that the warehouse windows opening
on the courtyard were not shuttered as were
those that overlooked the street

  on the top floor he stood still listening
his heart pounded with the exertion of the
long fast climb and with the excitement of
the chase far down below the sounds of
struggle had subsided piano he knew
was either dead or had been made a prisoner
the watchmen by now he felt positive
must have recognized their mistake must
know that there had been two intruders and
that one of these had succeeded in giving
them the slip

  as a matter of fact it seemed to him they
were coming up again some of them though
every sound in that echoing maze-like place
was so broken enlarged and distorted that
he found it difficult to tell just what was
going on

   at any rate outs the word for me 
said he to himself

  he hurried along the hallway skirting
the courtyard looking for one of the sky-
lights that piano had assured him were
there-but all in vain cautiously as he
went he raised the flash-lamp high in air
and pressed the button throwing the little
silvery beam up against the ceiling of fire-
brick no skylight no trap-door no
opening of any kind

  what  thought graham penned in
after all ive been through after all ive
done and suffered-just at the very last
of it just within an ace of going free shall
i be caged up here like a rat and taken by
the steeled conscience



those idiots by god i wont not while
i have life 

   he reached a turning to the right took it
and sped silently along the west side of the
court

   at his left he vaguely saw a row of doors
with here and there the gaping mouth of a
hallway at his right windows that looked
out into the yard twelve stories below-
windows all heavily barred

  he stopped peered through into the
night and pondered where thought he
were the skylights that piano had reported 
he did not know nor could he that the
architects plan had been changed in that
respect puzzled and confused he stood
there to breathe to rest an instant he
pressed a hand to the singed spot on his
head

  a light below him and off to the right
drew his attention through the windows
on the south side of the court he saw a
lantern swinging upward saw legs moving
up a flight of stairs

  after me again he realized far
away echoed the sound of footsteps climb-
ing climbing

  desperate he ran forward once more
then he stopped

   its no use said he  this game of
tag with me for it cant last long theyll
get me sure this way-if not now then
later its a losing fight ive got to make a
break	t

   if i die doing it thats all right too
thats a thousand times better than to be
taken robbed of everything ive waited and
suffered and labored for and sent back to
 stive  better ten thousand times 

  again he peered through a window

   above it perhaps three feet from the top
of its bars projected a broad cornice once
there he hoped he might lie able to swing
himself up onto the roof and from the roof
what possibilities of escape might not exist

  he scrutinized the window-pane vaguely
seen by the infiltering dim light that al-
ways hangs above a city

  h-m-m-m wire-glass said he
thats a job in itself 

  saying no further word he opened the
satchel took out the jimmy the remainder
of the powder and tape and set them on
the sill

  with a quick firm blow he struck the
jimmy through the glass and one by one
began twisting the wires off the glass
held by the wires fell only in small pieces

graham shoved these out so that they fell
in the court a hundred and twenty feet be-
low the slight noise he made could hard-
ly he felt certain reach the ascending
watchmen way round on the other side of
the great warehouse

  in less than two minutes he had broken
the wires all about the pane had lifted out
the glass and laid it noiselessly on the floor
beside the satchel

  there remained then only the bars

  at the base of two of these he dumped all
the remaining thermit and hastily set it off
the stuff so potent with steel ate the mere
wrought-iron like so much wood present-
ly graham saw that the bars were melted
clean through with the jimmy he priecl
them aside then bent them sharply up and
out of the way

  now  said he

  he thrust his head far out and looked
down he could see nothing there below
save a black fathomless gulf the court-
yard was wholly lost in shadow above
the cornice made a dark line across the
gray night-sky a desperate venture in-
deed he realized to try vxl reach it to
pull himself up and over it but nothing
else remained

   its that or-living death  thought he
 now then 

  hesitating no moment he pressed his
hand to his breast assuring himself that
the sealed package still rested safely in his
pocket then lightly climbed to the sill

  hark what was that a cry far down
the corridor-the flash of a lantern-the
crack of a pistol-shot a bullet snarled past
him  there he goes quick you  he
heard a voice shout

  graham laughed wildly then with the
agility of an acrobat climbed through the
opening he had made

  he turned clinging to the bars and
quickly scaled the tall window

  now he was at the top outside the build-
ing with nothing below him save a sheer
drop into the darkness twining his legs
around the bars he reached outward for
the edge of the cornice just a little too
far for both hands to reach strain as he
might he could not compass it

  here here we got him cried
somebody inside graham heard feet run-
ning full tilt

  desperate tilled with the strange abnor-
mal strength that comes to men in time of
supreme peril he grappled a bar with one


the railroad mans magazine

hand raised himself loosened the grip of
his legs and stood there above the chasm
one foot resting on a cross-bar

  with a desperate effort he managed to get
his right hand up and over the edge of the
eaves

  the fingers clutched and tightened

  graham let go with his left hand he
swung clear for a moment he hung there
by one hand alone in mid air

  a dark form appeared at the smashed
window

   hey quick here  screamed the pur-
suer

  graham kicked at him striking him full
in the face and blinding him as he flung
up the other hand and caught the eaves
with that also

  his biceps tightened the big muscles
coiled and swelled graham pulled himself
inch by inch up up till now at last he
could get one knee one foot up into the
metal gutter

  summoning his last ounce of strength he
held so for a second then with his right
hand clamped hold of the graveled edge of
the roof itself

  a moment later he had hauled himself
panting spent and dizzy up onto the flat
roof right at the very lip of the abyss

  the space of ten rapid heart-beats per-
haps he lay there while below him rapidly
swelled the chorus of disappointed execra-
tions of threats and confused commands
then away from the canon-like emptiness
he crawled on hands and knees up a sjight
rise over tar and gravel

  safe for the instant he scrambled to his
feet and looked around him

  dimly at the low crest of the roof he
made out a cluster of chimney-stacks and
ventilators to right a housing of some
sort possibly containing the wheels and top
framework of an elevator to left a dull
upthrow of light from spring street at the
front of the warehouse

  not that way he knew lay escape he
turned to the right ran rapidly along the
pebbles reached the corner of the court and
turned again to eastward

  ahead of him he vaguely saw more chim-
ney for a moment he thought of crouch-
ing behind them of hiding there like a hunt-
ed animal at bay but that idea he instantly
put from him it could not serve the pur-
suer- knew now where he was up some
stair or ladder he felt certain they would im-
mediately be after him again-half a dozen

of them maybe more-armed ready for bat-
tle ready to kill

   ive got to get down off of here-down
-some way panted graham as he ran

  his heart leaped painfully his breath
seemed to choke and stifle him like a hor-
rible dream a nightmare the whole thing
seemed-a nightmare from which he knew
he could not wake on his forehead he felt
the sweat starting copiously a sudden
weakness came over him and he began to
tremble fie pulled up short

  come come boy he exclaimed
this wont ever do he tried to get
himself in hand to think a moment to plan

  a noise on the other side of the build-
ing on the roof across the gaping black
square of the courtyard came to his ears
he turned

  by the vague light of a lantern that
seemed to be shooting its rays upward
through an opening of some sort in a long
inverted cone he made out the head and
shoulders of a man

   come on youse  he heard a cry all
we got to do now is keep him busy till the
cops coitfe 

  graham fell on hand and knees again
away behind the chimneys he crept sound-
lessly beyond them he passed in front of
him now he perceived the edge of the roof
running at right angles with the street

   its there or nowhere  thought he  if
nowhere then i fight 

  he reached the edge crouched there and
peered down

  by the half light that filtered up from the
street he saw at a glance the situation that
confronted him

  an old-fashioned building joined the
warehouse its peaked roof slate covered
twenty-five or thirty feet below

  a man leaping to it-even though he
could endure the shock-must land direct-
ly at the ridge else he would skid down
the slates either to back or front and shoot
off into the alley or into spring street the
drop from the eaves graham knew could
not be less than seventy feet sure death
to miss the ridge

  he groaned involuntarily and looked
back

  already the lantern bearer had climbed
up the scuttle on the roof of the warehouse
graham could see him and two others cau-
tiously treading along casting fantastic
ghostly shadows up against the chimney
stacks
the steeled conscience



   in three minutes theyll be on me in
 two realized the fugitive ive got to
do it

   summoning all his nerve and powers of
cool calculation he peered down again
the slate roof he saw was broken by a
row of dormer windows it terminated
sharply fifty or sixty feet away beyond it
was another flat roof somewhat lower
there he felt positive must be a skylight or
some means of getting down to the street

   well here goes said graham if i
pull through all right - if i dont thats all
right too ive done all a man could do
now its up to fate 

   erect on the very edge of the warehouse
roof he stood right on the eaves he bal-
anced a shout behind him and feet that
struck out a tattoo over the gravel told him
he had been seen he only smiled

    too late now for you to take a hand in
this  he cried

   coolly he judged the distance as so often
he had done in the university gym then
he clenched his fists crouched paused a
second-and launched out down into emp-
ty space

   despite his careful judgment and his
skill the shock all but stunned him the
breath was driven from his body he lay
there dazed and gasping conscious only of
one thing-diat he had struck the ridge
that he was not sliding down the roof that
he must hold on

   then came the realization that he could
not stay where he was painfully dragging
himself along the slippery peak he crept 
away a sharp pain in his right leg told
him he had injured it though how badly
he could not tell in his tense excitement
he put the pain out of mind and kept on on
with die steep slippery precipice yawning
for him at either hand

   he reached the farther end of the old
roof

  from behind him he heard shouts a
fusillade crackled he felt a dull twinge in
his shoulder as though it had been hit by a
hard snowball

   before him he dimly saw the next roof
only a few feet lower to it he fell rather
than jumped he hobbled grotesquely off
along it a housing loomed in front of
him

   round it he dodged out of range of the
revolvers

  he saw a door all but exhausted he
tried it the door resisted

  maddened then as though by the long
savage succession of pursuit and suffering
he flung his whole strength against it

  something broke the door swung open
graham staggered in holding the latch
vaguely he heard the disappointed shouts
and oaths fron the warehouse they seemed
very far very strange

  he stood there an instant swaying in
the gloom still clinging to the door

   where am i   thought he everything
seemed to whirl and spin a roaring filled
his ears

  buck up he said aloud why
fool you arent going to cave in now are
you  

  as though the reproof had been spoken
in scorn by some one else he pulled to-
gether he looked about him

  it was he saw an ordinary roof house
that he stood in before him stairs de-
scended at the bottom a low-burning gas
flame fluttered in the draft from die open
door

  quickly he closed it he squared his
shoulders hastily brushed the gravel and
soot from his knees dusted his hands on
his trousers and with only a slight limp-
despite the growing pain in his ankle start-
ed confidently down-stairs

  two minutes later before any of the
cautious tenement dwellers had had time to
awaken to the situation or molest him he
issued into the street below

  another minute and he was round the
corner on the opposite sidewalk he saw
two patrolmen running full drive toward
the warehouse his nerve was good enough
to let him stop turn and watch them with
an interest which would have disarmed the
suspicions of keener brains than theirs

  a car came by he signaled it swung
aboard went inside and sat down calmly
he picked up a newspaper lying on the
seat behind it he hid his face easily
enough from the sleepy and indifferent
glance of the conductor and the two fagged
passengers

  before the warehousemen had reached the
street and had incoherently explained things
to the officers he was a dozen blocks away

   only then did he realize fully that he had
been shot in the left shoulder despite that
fact and a sprained ankle he gamely board-
ed an l train by standing outside on
the platform lie concealed that fact from the
uard and also managed to keep from faint-
ing from loss of blood

  at one hundred and fourth street he
left the train a few minutes later he had
reached the flat and was safe

  the danger was all past and the prize
won his degree of master cracksman had
been signed with his own blood sealed and
delivered the way toward justice had
been made free and open his last his
greatest  crush  was at an end

 another railroad dog

his name was jack and what he didnt know about traveling wasnt
worth-while

the following interesting dog story was sent
to us by one of the old-time readers of the
railroad mans magazine

  jack was only a pup a black-and-white fox-
terrier when i first saw him dodging around the
roundhouse at lexington some ten or eleven
years ago it took about two years to get jack
to board an engine but when he once got ac-
quainted with the cab the strides that he took in
his education were startling

  he soon learned to sit on the firemans seat-box
and hang his head out of the window with his
paws on the arm-rest he gradually got up suf-
ficient courage to keep this position while the
engine was under headway my father who was
on the road at the time taught him to start the
hell by pulling the cord with his teeth

  jack had his favorite engineers and among
them were uncle dallas pulliam and james wilt-
shire one of the most thrilling rides that jack
ever had was with wiltshire on the 

  train no  a passenger was leaving lexing-
ton at  am one cold snowy morning when
the hostler w o vaughan climbed on to the
pilot to ride from the depot to the crossover to
throw the switch jack got aboard with him but
did not get off when he should have and was
carried on out of town wiltshire did not know
that the dog was on his engine until jack crossed
over the steam-chest made the trip along the run-
ning-board and scratched at the cab door for ad-
mittance how he ever got from the pilot to
the steam-chest has always been a mystery

  i have seen this dog on three different divisions
of the l and n and on a number of trains be-
tween louisville and cincinnati he would strike
a freight out of lexington and would not be seen
in that city for months but would be heard of
now and then from one of the other divisions
where he could be seen riding in the engines

  jack knew his friends and never forgot a kind
word likewise lie never forgot a harsh one
on the editorial carpet

     where we let some of our superheated steam
     escape and listen for a pound in the air cylinder

our first section of the  special will make
the run in schedule time unless some of you
flag it along the line every car is newly painted
the brasses are all polished and tine big atlantic is
steaming and ready as we look it all over before
it starts on its journey we cannot find one flaw
but we want our readers to be in their respective
towers of criticism ready to send word ahead to
give us the arm should they find anything that
does not please them

  that is the only way in which we can make a
magazine to give satisfaction to every one

  nq train leaves a terminal without some com-
plaining passenger and perhaps no other train
carries so many passengers as the one we are
proudly starting on its monthly journey in the
little back shop here in new york where the con
the eagle-eye the shack and all the rest of the
crew are forever busy it is a pleasure more than a
pain to know that you have found a poem with
disconnected joints a story that reads like a lot of
flat wheels on the down grade or a special article
that looms up as sadly as a liogger who aiming for
a record has got the washout sign

  we think pretty well of this january section
we have tried to start the new year right now
let us take a little look at our february way-bill

  there will be some excess pressure on  the
a b c of freight rates by john c thompson
the second part of this all-important discussion
will have a plush seat in the february pullman

  robert i-i rogers is another one of our writers
who went abroad last summer while there he se-
cured some red-hot cinders in the shape of articles
which are going to be mighty valuable to you boys
they will show you the great differences between
american and foreign railroads in all their
branches both mr regers and mr carter ran as
extra trains while abroad mr carters  europes
old-fashioned railroads  appears in this number
it clearly indicates that some of the railway
methods still in vogue in europe are about as
funny as a lead crown-sheet

  mr rogerss first article will tell of the fast run
of the french express-how a crack european
flier is operated as compared with one of our own
it is worth knowing

  we have a splendid bunch of stories about rail-
road men and their encounters wilh animals all
railroad men love animals and these stories are
the kind that hoist the steam in the laugh-injector

  the day of the pass is still a pleasant memory

to many politicians and others who found it neces-
sary-to travel without paying we all know how
the government put a stop to this form of graft a
few years ago if you will turn to the old letter by
bill nye which we print on page  of this num-
ber you will see what was an unexaggerated form
of demand some twenty odd years ago though
bill was a humorist the railroads received demands
for passes which were equally as preposterous we
have a special article for february which tells of
the old days when the railroads considered passes
equal in importance with rolling-stock how the
railroads were annually held up for these special
privileges makes one marvel that they stood for it
so long

  the help for men department will contain an
article of special importance to young men em-
ployed in the business side of railroading

  then there are other articles one tells of the
difficulties encountered by tramps sleeping on
trains we will have the second part of mr
walterss splendid article on bridge-building wal-
ter gardner seavers roundhouse tales will appear
again ten thousand miles by rail will have
its customary place and mr willets will tell of the
famous hold-ups in the missouri river valley

push it along

the letters of praise which have come to us
during the past three months from countless
of our readers are more than deeply appreciated
we say this with modesty bubbling from all our
flues when one man says  i would not miss a
copy of the railroad mans magazine for five
dollars  another  for my regular monthly laugh


the railroad mans magazine

i go to t e smith and emmet f harte and
another  t read twelve magazines and yours is
the best -with such words as these coming along
we feel as if we had struck a running as easy as
a down-grade on a sunny morning

  we want you boys to tell your friends how good
the magazine is we know you like it and when
you meet a friend who finds that his reading is
not just up to the mark ask him to look at the
railroad maxs magazine we believe it will
interest him even if he is not a railroad man and
it is surprising how many readers we have whose
only interest in railroading is the wonderful ro-
mance courage and heroism which we describe in
our pages

  you will do us a good turn by pushing a good
thing along we will reciprocate by giving you
each month the very best reading matter that we
can possibly secure

railroad education

railroad education in the university of
illinois appears to be assuming unusual
proportions it is planned we understand to
erect a large transportation building at champaign
illinois where technical railroading will be taught
the idea has been approved by railroad men and
it is understood the railroad companies of illinois
will lend substantial support to the originators in
their attempt to secure an appropriation from the
state legislature for the new work

  the santa fes shops are crowded with ap-
prentices the pennsylvanias schools at scranton
and bedford have tlieir usual quota of ambitious
young men who are looking to the railroads for
their future the international correspondence
schools which give an excellent education in all
branches of railroading are receiving their large
percentage of students who are destined to become
railroad men

   with all this it looks as if the railroads ofthe
future will have the very best men that the country
can produce educated up to the standard of tech-
nical and theoretical expectations in the most
approved manner wages have increased in rail-
roading at a greater rate perhaps than any other
calling but it is a calling for men of determination
courage and initiative because its future holds
out the greatest possibilities



marine engineering

editor the railroad mans magazine

in the october issue of the railroad mans
magazine i noticed an article in the light
of the lantern department asking for infor-
mation regarding what it is necessary to do to
become a marine engineer my advice on the sub-
ject based on my own experience is this

  first serve four years in a shop if possible-
the lime served in a railroad-shop counting the
same as any other next spend a year at sea as

an oiler and water-tender and you are ready to go
up for your examination before the united states
inspector of hulls and boilers if you pass you
receive a third assistants  ticket

   if the applicant has no shop practise it is much
harder the length of time spent at sea is about
six years two years in the shop and three at
sea however will prove satisfactory

  the pay for oilers on the pacific coast is 
a month and found a water-tender gets 
while both oiling and water-tending on small jobs
also brings about  on the atlantic coast
these jobs bring about  a month less according
to the regular union schedule-g e m san

moments of emergency

editor the railroad mans magazine 

in your issue of october  i read of the
experience of one joseph lutz engineer to
which i would like to take issue with you
under the heading of  moments of emergency 
is the story of how said lutz got out on top of his
engine and shut her off when his side-rod  strip-
ped  her

  in my experience which has been long and
varied and some of it right on that division too
such a thing could not possibly be done

  maybe you can explain how it was done if
you can you will certainly relieve the minds of a
big bunch of railroaders

  if you will publish this in your december issue
of  it will prove to all of us that you do not
fear criticism-j d hoyle winnemucca nev

  we could not grant mr hoyles request regard-
ing the publication of his letter in our december
number as that number had gone to press when
the letter reached our office

 the story of the snapped side-rod told in  mo-
ments of emergency in our october number
seems impossible to any one not familiar with the
type of engine commonly known as the  hog
the side-rods churn along immediately beneath
the cab which is divided into two parts and strad-
dles the boiler at its middle

  in this particular case as soon as the side-rod
broke the engineer was at its mercy it swung
up with terrific force wrecking his side of the cab
and throwing him to the floor badly hurt even
if he had been able to lift himself at once to his
feet the mechanism was so badly battered that it
would not have responded there was no way to
stop the engine from the cab

  as soon as he realized what had happened he
knew that nothing remained but to cut the air and
working his way through the scalding steam which
was escaping in great clouds he passed over the
boiler crossed to the tank and at the imminent
risk to his life swung down between the pounding
cars and opened the valve

  the hero of the accident fred wooley whose
identity was confused in the original reports of the
accident on account of his extreme modesty has
since received recognition for his heroic action in
bringing the train to a stop and preventing a

the brain teasers

you will notice that the brain teasers are
not in their accustomed place this month
we regret this just as much as the mathematical
minds who seek recreation in solving these choice
twisters from month to month-but the fact of the
matter is this the last crop of teasers was so
old that we did not deem them worthy of a place
even on the slow freight

  we hereby issue orders to all our readers to send
in some new teasers scratch your think-domes
and se what you can give us a puzzle for the
railroad mans magazine need obey only these
three rules

  	it must be a railroad puzzle

  	it must be solvable

  	it must be accompanied by its correct answer
and solution

  the following are the answers to the teasers
published on page  of our december number

despatching by telephone

editor the railroad mans magazine

having read the articlc on the telephone
which appeared in the december issue of
the railroad mans magazine and no-
ting that it sets forth only the advantages i beg to
submit to the readers of your magazine some of

the disadvantages of telephone despatching which
are numerous indeed

  it seems to me if morse were living and saw
the new arrangement called a telephone system he
would laugh it to scorn and say  why that is
no system at all and we operators would ad-
vocate morses views too

   on this road i cumberland valley railroad com-
pany of  miles single track and possibly 
miles double track i have not heard of an operator
that likes the telephones i will not say  tele-
phone system as it can not be called a system
for various reasons

   first as the operator cannot be at the phone
more than half the time he does not know whether
the scheduled trains are running on time or
whether they are two hours late

  second he does not know whether there are
any extras out and if there are whether within
one or ten miles of his station

   consequently when he hears a train whistling
he rushes out and looks up and down the track if
there are curves near the office to see which way
the train is coming when he ascertains its
direction he rushes back into the office and gives
the train the proper signal not knowing whether
the train is no   or  unless he can judge
by the make-up of the train the poor unpro-
tected operator is working in the dark no one but
the despatcher knowing what is going on

   third  when the operator wishes to talk to the
despatcher he has not time to stay at the phone
for half an hour at a time consequently he must go
to the phone take down the receiver and ascer-
tain if the line is busy if he finds it busy he
dare not break in he goes back to the ticket-
window and waits on half a dozen customers then
steals another minute and tries again with the
same result he repeats this operation probably a
dozen times gets disgusted and swears he will go
where there are no phones-and do you blame
him 

   heretofore under the telegraph system when the
despatcher called for an order the operator could
answer up and then resume his ticket-selling until
the despatcher had raised all the offices he wanted
for the order now he must stay at the phone
until several offices are raised and all have re-
peated the order while behind him he hears the
muttering of impatient scolding passengers
would it be any wonder then that he would get
the order wrong when he divides his attention be-
tween what is going over the phone and what the
passengers are scolding about

  fourth  there are so many words sound alike
on the phone and the operator may think he is
right and be wrong all the time

  many people have a mistaken idea that the
phone is the faster i have a  learners  instru-
ment in this office and have experimented on it
with the following result order repealed back
before the operator on the phone was two-thirds
done

  to sum it up in a few words railroading has
lost its charm heretofore the op no matter in
what part of the building he happened to be
could listen to the merry hum of the instruments
and know as much about the location of the trains
as the despatcher himself-and it was music to
his ears now he must put the harness over his
cranium and amid the hum of various noises like
so many horses going into a barn endeavor to


the railroad mans magazine

pick out what he is supposed to get while a mob
of angry passengers are making a break for the
train without tickets

  the leverman who heretofore listened to the
instruments and threw levers at the same time
must wait until the despatcher sees fit no allow
him to leav he phone if he fails to get the track
lined up properly for the approaching train it
means ninety days in the pie-house for him or
perhaps dismissal from the service

  do you readers call that a system

  under the telegraph system the operator knew
when a train was nearing his station and knew
what orders he had if tile despatchers attention
was taken up elsewhere he called the despatchers
attention to the fact that the train would soon be
in and want orders

  but how is the situation now often a train
gets by a station when it was the dcspatchers in-
tention to give orders at that point the only
instance i could point out where a telephone is of
any advantage is where the operator has nothing
else to do but listen to the phone those places are
scarce very scarce-clarence b naugle opera-

early walschaert gear engines

editor the railroad mans magazine

the walschaert valve gear has been in use in
this country since  on the boston
revere beach and lynn railroad and on
narrow-gage locomotives built by william mason
of taunton massachusetts

  shortly after mr mason built a standard-gage
locomotive called the  william mason for the v
northern division of what was at that time the
old colony railroad running between new
bedford and fitchburg the writer was well
acquainted with this engine and its engineer
having ridden on it several times

  in  william mason built a narrow-gage en-
gine named  onward fitted with the walschaert
valve gear this engine was on exhibition during
the centennial exposition at philadelphia haul-
ing passenger-trains around the grounds as the
road was composed almost entirely of sharp curves
and steep grades this service was exceedingly
hard but the engine performed the work satis-
factorily and at the end of the season it was in
almost as good condition as when it commenced
running

  at the close of the exposition this engine was
sold to the new york and manhattan beach rail-
road which resulted in an order for nine more
engines of the same pattern i remember this
engine and its engineer-the late william parks of
taunton massachusetts-very well

 between  and  mr mason built
twenty-five engines for the denver and south
park and colorado railroad fitted with the wal-
schaert valve gear in  he built a standard-
gage locomotive for the nantasket beach rail-
road in  one for the boston and maine to
run between boston and medford

  these engines were also very satisfactory the
writer had an opportunity of riding on both
several times after mr mason stopped building
locomotives the boston revere beach and lynn
railroad secured these patterns and had several
locomotives built in manchester new hampshire
fitted with the walschaert valve gear they have
now about  engines in service-j f damon

the brakeman on the freight

 by georce e bowen

      by my warm window snugly wrapped
      away from winters wrath

       i watch the tide of life go by
       along the commerce path

       they hurry on-the young the old

      the hungry rich and poor-

       a swift procession toward the priz

        all struggle to secure

       i may not measure them aright

       yet through each guise i peer
       into the purpose of the heart
       that knows the least of fear

      and though full many a hero may
      among them battle fate

        i hold above his fellows all

       the brakeman on the freight

          

       no wreath of holly waits for him
       who struggles through the night
       to make his sleepless duty whole
       and guard with anxious might
       the treasures of the rushing train
       that thunders on its way
       to feed and clothe and shelter men
       and help them as it may

       no feast for him is richly spread
       who through the storms delay

       brings succor to his starving kind
       and drives their fears away-

       a royal banqueter he sat

 with duty long and late
the railroad mans magazine

 while polar plenty surfeited
 the brakeman on the freight

 sometimes the heat is pitiless

 again the fatal sleet
 spreads death along the narrow way
 that offers no retreat

 vet be his train a solid one
 or mixed by wretched fate

 one duty calls forever to
 the brakeman on the freight

 always the crashing mighty jar
 of wheels that shake the earth
 proclaims the hero of the road
 and tells his rugged worth

 his constancy is color fast

 and wears through sun or rain
 the same devotion night or day
 though long or short the train

 i dont forget the engineer-

 his is an honored name

 for all the world has sung his praise
 and glorified his fame

 but i propose more than a toast
 wherein to fairly rate
 the conscience and the credit of
 the brakeman on the freight

 winter or summer wet or dry

 on mountain or on plain

 youll find him loyal to his trust-
 the genius of his train

 the language of his lantern cries
 along the blackest night

 defying death that men may live
 from cars delivered right

 the roughest work the toughest fare
 make this grim conqueror
 a rugged force of stoic mien
 and hard exterior

 but manhoods independent pride
 crowns the subordinate
 a ruler of the rail while hes
 the brakeman on the freight

 i	wave to him my best salute
 wheneer his train goes by-

 a brave commander tightly perched
 upon a car top high-

 no field of battle ever knew
 of courage grand or great

 a stouter kind than surely leads
 the brakeman on the freight

 good cheer to you my steady friend
 come weather foul or fine

 long may you live and ever bright
 your starry signal shine

 whereer you go oh be you safe-
 the tempest for your mate-

 and all the world a lover of
 the brakeman on the freight

 until another time good friend

 oh let it be-adieu

 for by my iin a braver heart
 than yours i never knew

 hold fast and duty give you grace

 on curving track or straight

        to fail nor fall while you shall be
        the brakeman on the freight

  trusting that i am not encroaching upon your
  time as i know so many do i am respectfully
  yours-w e fiedler louisville kentucky
  thank you for the poem mr fiedler you may

roy would take all care of the flock and supply eggs and chickens for the farm table and

full of energetic
capable men
whose days are spent in work which is not
suited to their natural talents thousands
of these men realize that all that stands be-

getting farther away from what they most
want we are going to help these men
we are going to lend them the cost of the
training they need and let them make their

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months on a city

to the average poultry-
man that would seem
impossible and when we tell
you that we have actually
done a  poultry bus-
iness with  hens on a
corner in the city garden 
feet wide by  feet long
we are simply stating facts
it would not be possible to
get such returns by any one
of the systems of poultry
keeping recommended and
practiced by the american
people still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

note the condition of these three months old pullets these pullets and their ancestors for seven
generation hare never been allowed o run outside the coops

the philo system is unlike all other ways of keeping
poultry

ati  i many respects just the reverse accomplishing things in poultry work

that are hard to believe without seeing

testimonials

lit dear mr philo	valley falla n y  oct  

after another years work with your system of poultry keeping i making
three years in all i am thoroughly convinced of its practicability  raised
all my chicks in your brooder-ooops containing your flreless brooders and
kept them there until they were nearly matured decreasing the number in
each coop however as they grew in size those who have visited my plant
have been unanimous iu their praise of my birds raised by this system

sincerely yours	irev e b lempler

mr e it piiilo elmira n y	elmira n y oct  ing

dear sir-no doubt you will be interested to leari ol our success in keep-
ing poultry by the philo system onr first years work is now nearly com-
pleted it has given us an income of over  from six pedigree hens and
one cockerel had we understood the work as well as we now do after a
years experience we could easily have made over  fmm the six hens
iu addition to the profits from tin sale of pedigree chirks we have cleared
over  running our hatchery plant consisting of mi cycle hatchers w
are pleased with the results and expect to do better the coming year wltli
best wishes we are	very truly yours mrs c p goodrich

mr e it philo elmira n y	south britain conn april  

dear sir-i have followed your system as close as i could  tin result is a
complete success if there can beany improvement on nature your brooder
is it ihe first experience i had with your system was inst december i
hatched  chicks under two hens put them as on as hatched in one of
your brooders out of doors and at the age of three mouths  sold them at c
a pound they then averaged lbs each and the man i sold them to said
they were the finest lie ever saw and he wants all i can spare this season

engineer

by robert fulkerson hoffman

every one of you railroad men - and your
wives and mothers too - should read this
story of mountain railroading in the southwest
because its characters are the kind of people you
work with every day and the scenes and events
described are familiar to you all

the rock island employes magazine says

its a book that a man with the vim of the road in his blood
will simply have to read if he once gets his eye on it one
of the best things about it is the fact that it is not one of
those long-winded novels that a man as busy as a railroad
man can only read in unsatisfactory snatches rather every
chapter is a powerful story in itself just the thing for a
cleric to tuck away in his desk till the latter end of noon
hour a book that a trainman might put in his locker to read
when he has to lay over sometime just the sort for an
engineer to slip into his cab seat to read when he has to hang
around at some little place on the line

get the book today - you will read it over
and over again and like it better each time

children are blessed with
a sweet tooth

so are you-and you should encourage it for the system demands sugar
more than meats of the three nutritive elements which support life-
sugar protein and fat-sugar is the most important you cant eat too
much of it in its correct form

 it is the native sugar in good ribbon cane syrup that gives it its wonderful
 food value-the whole substance is wholesome sugar

the sweetness of many syrups sold to the public is a little sugar or
saccharine matter added to an insipid by-product filler-tasteless until
the sugar is added such syrup by itself or made into cake and candy
has about as much food value as shavings

syrup

 is the finest example of a succulent georgia ribbon cane syrup made by the old plantation
 open kettle process put into cans direct from the evaporator while hot-thus insuring
 the permanency of its natural sweet flavor and inimitable taste its the good old-fashioned
 taste you remember in your grandmothers pantry-the most welcome food children can
 have if your dealer doesnt keep alaga write us and we will see that you are supplied

watches there is one though moderaie priced which has come to be con-
spicuous for its close liming-accurate as only high-priced watches have
