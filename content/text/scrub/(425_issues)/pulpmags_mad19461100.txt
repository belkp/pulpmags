mammoth adventure

was that hot and that dull

  juan espadin was justly an unhappy
man the passage out to new spain
from the homeland had been nearly as
dull as were the streets of nombre de
dios a man must fight dullness as he
fights an enemy in cordoba the house
of espadin had long been noted for its
skill at gaming guala who would
think a man of that house could lose his
modest fortune in a single ship-board
game-and make an enemy besides
yet it was so

  espadin grinned ruefully and shifted
along the wall against which he idly
leaned the woman on the walk passed
him he no more than saw her his eyes
turned inward on his misfortune how
could a man guess that the simpering
dandy he had so elegantly insulted at
the captains table was a man of note
in this city foul luck nothing more
it now appeared that dario lozan was
not only a man of note but that his
family ruled this colony

  behold city guards had sought espa-
din within an hour of his landing their
captain was a vicente lozan they
brought an order banning the cavalier
juan espadin from nombre by sunset
it was signed by reinaldo lozan gov-
ernor behind the order was the threat
of the old inquisition recently revived
in this colony and alfredo lozan was
chief inquisitor of nombre

  por dios the lozan were numerous
dogs espadin shrugged he must leave
the city but how along through the
jungle swamps across the isthmus to
panama foolhardy he might be but
a fool-no the beasts and brigands
of that steamy dark made no distinction
between the rich and honest men it
was yet three days until a train of silver
mules and a company of soldiery would
make the trip wait or stay it was a
bad matter

  espadin shifted again a stir drew

his lagging interest up the street the
woman with the shawl-and a man he
was about to turn away had not the
woman passed within a yard of him
without casting so much as a glance at
him-without raising one spark of in-
terest in return she must be in fact
a hag under her veil it was the man
who interested him an old pig and
showy the toledo blade at his side
vas too long for his arms he was too
hasty without a swordsmans grace
and he lacked an espadins judgment
in women

ispadin started leisurely up the
street it was not his affair but a
man should not wear the gear of a cav-
alier without first learning the duties
of a gentleman the man had a firm
grip on one of the womans arms halt-
ing her he turned angrily at juans
touch juan saw an arrogant face which
was somehow familiar

  tall friend he told the face with
formality the lady has grown already
weary of you i tell you this to save
embarrassment

  embarrassment the man pro-
tested hotly you misbegotten swine
hands off hands off you accost me
todos los santos ill read you a les-
son-

  only the great could afford such an-
ger over so small a matter espadin
wondered who this spindly old follower
of veiled women might be but it was a
faint curiosity he stepped back a pace
and as the mans long toledo scraped
from its scabbard his own cordoban
steel sang in his hand he was stiff from
long weeks on shipboard he took no
chance a man and his sword seldom
look alike and a clever wrist is often in
an old arm he made a single feint and
set his point a handbreath into the
mans shoulder

  the fellow bleated as though struck
the cassock and the sword



nigh to death and sagged to his knees
espadin caught a fistful of velvet in the
crown of the mans fanciful hat and
wiped his blade clean of such thin
blood he bowed then and spoke pleas-
antly

  my advice senor-it comes free
with a pinking forget the lady-and
get a shorter blade it takes a stout
man to make a cloth-yard of toledo
dance properly

  outraged the man gave over his
moaning and began to shout for assist-
ance

  guardia municipal aqui aqui
help brigands i am killed bring
soldiers bring police swiftly

  a sharp blow struck the calf of
juans leg he wheeled only the wom-
an was behind him she had swept back
her veil exposing the face of a red-
lipped warm-eyed saint espadin was
stunned por dios how could he have
made such a mistake a hag-ai-
perhaps in a hundred years but beau-
tiful now this old fool who thought
a shoulder pink a mortal wound had
showed better judgment than a cordo-
ban

  ah well a man is entitled to one mis-
take and he should be in favor such
a beauty could feel but nausea at the
old goat who had halted her she would
be grateful for a cavalier and per-
haps there would be reward bien for-
tunat even in nombre de dios an en-
terprising man might find an end to
dullness

  espadin bent low

  senorita- he said juan espadin
of cordoba-

  the old goat left off bellowing his
eyes sharpened malevolently

  espadin he snarled i shall re-
member that name

  at the same instant the girls thick
skirts rustled and a sharply shod little
foot struck juans leg again solidly

and she loosed a torrent of bitter abuse

  fool pig you and your hasty
sword before god i hate cava-
liers for three days i have baited my
trap then when my game at last is
in hand you spit him you then can
answer to brother paco when he asks
where is this worst of the lozans-the
carrion i promised to bring him
espadin saw soldiery at the lower
end of the street all too plainly in
haste he stood motionless appalled
at the continuing flavor of his luck

  this- he choked -this is also
a lozan

  the girl nodded then she saw the
guards wrapping her skirts close she
ran another company of soldiers ap-
peared at the upper end of the street
cutting off escape the girl ignored
them running lightly and with the pur-
posefulness of one who knows where
she goes espadin looked at the two
companies of city guardsmen-doubt-
less numbering among them still more
of the innumerable clan which seemed
to flush like rats from the stones of
nombre he felt a tightness in him

  pues he was a clever fellow he had
insulted one of a family he had ig-
nored the orders of another and he
had pinked a third to make certain of
their affection all for the whiling of
a dull afternoon and a girll

  juan espadin was not a man to run
after a woman the dignity of a cava-
lier set certain limits in such matters
but the guards were close he over-
took the girl as she dodged into the
doorway of a large house which backed
up to the outer wall of the city

           chapter ii
           jungle friar

he house was empty apparently
long deserted the girl raced


mammoth adventure

through dusty rooms to a door set in
the rear wall of the last the planking
was old it stuck under her hand the
guardia sounded close in the street es-
padin hit the door drove it open and
wheeled with drawn sword to face the
guards should they break into the room
before the girl had a fair start but she
pulled insistently at his arm

  this way will be useless to the
brotherhood now she panted it
will be watched thanks to the alarm
you raised but were safe from here
on come-

  espadin obeyed the door let into
a tunnel under the city wall the tun-
nel ended in a thicket the girl found
a trail with the ease of familiarty the
smell of the city faded with the sun-
light in its place was the damp aroma
of growing things and the perpetual
twilight of rank tree shaded under-
growth the swamp-the jungle

  espadin was uneasy he was a man
to see things as they were he knew
what kind of government was set up by
most of the favored nobles sent out by
the king to rule his colonial lands
there were indians in this jungle who
would admire a fine spanish head like
his own as a token of revenge for many
injustices and there were brigands
who would count a knife-stroke fair ex-
change for the privilege of feeling of his
pockets

  the girl ran untroubled through the
gloom she ran lightly and steadily es-
padin was vain of his body he gave
it certain care and it served him ex-
ceedingly well yet he was drenched
with sweat and his lungs were heaving
when the girl at last stopped in a broken
clearing

  she gave him a glance yet tinged with
bitterness and whistled-a shrill sound
from such soft lips the whistle echoed
and the clearing was suddenly full of
men some were indians sullen faced

and shadowy more were brigands the
rest were the poor which crowd the
streets of any colonial city-victims of
swindle and false hopes and rapacious
taxation they were a strange crowd
but the strangest was a round ruddy-
faced man with a bushy fringe of gray
hair around a red and shining pate he
wore the robe of a holy order but he
looked like a teacher from the college
of kings wrestlers at cadiz his
stocky body was as solid as the walls
of nombre

  the face was that of a man espadin
could savor with the color of a bottle
of claret and the genial humor af ma-
laga from a cask little round eyes
winked measurement and the robed
man turned to the girl

  not reinaldo not alfredo not vi-
cente not dario-nay nor any of the
rest this is no lozan pepita you
have disappointed us

  the girl nodded grimly

  ail she spat and ask this one
why he is yours paco he owns a
swift blade where is father monte-
santo i must talk with him

  brother paco tipped his head toward
a great tree beyond the clearing

  in the chapel still nor has he
eaten give him food pepita make
him eat then if he would come out
among the men again-they lose heart
and need his voice-

  the girl shrugged weary assent and
moved away brother paco called after
her

  pepita-you had word from your
father

  the girls voice floated back heavily

  does a man speak from the inquisi-
tion with lozans in the church

brother paco frowned darkly

      suddenly he wheeled back to es-
padin

  friend your catechism i instruct
the cassock and the sword



you when reinaldo lozan became
governor of nombre he wrought many
changes father montesanto bishop
of the city was driven out to make
room for a friend of the lozan who also
wore the cloth felipe de ardenas
commander of the old guards was
brought before the governor and or-
dered to levy taxes for the lozan as
well as the king he was also ordered
to pass the keys and hiding place of
the old citys treasury to the lozan
these things he refused he was then
sent to the chambers of inquisition un-
used in father montesantos time but
bloody enough since

  remember these things well none
here forget them you have been
brought to us by felipes daughter
rosalia de ardenas whom we call
pepita those who hate the lozans
have gathered here those who have
suffered find shelter with us we are
a brotherhood united under father
montesanto for-ah-prayer and self-
preservation you would join us

  the mans ruddy face was beaded
with sweat when he was finished juan
saw here was a man unaccustomed to
much talk and the use of fine phrases
slowly juan swept the circle of faces
about him among other duties such
as preserving his life and health espa-
din had a fortune to regain this com-
pany seemed barren ground he had
need of acquaintance with rank and
wealth the company of silks and velvet
if he was to fare well in this land the
dark of this swamp depressed him

  i travel toward panama he said
i am delayed only until i can reach a
mule-train on the highway

  brother paco shook his head grimly

  only members of the brotherhood
may stay one night in our haven will
join

  espadin shrugged pues why not
there was after all the girl pepita

how could even these jackals be op-
pressive when she was at hand brother
paco asked his name he gave it
brother paco grinned disarmingly

  pepita has said you own a swift
sword we will see to that but first
a man of god must see to the temper of
his flock art a hasty man juan es-
padin

  espadin had no time for answer the
flat of a thick hand rapped smartly
against his cheek he was stunned for
an instant anger shook him he
stepped back intending to repay the
holy brothers caress with a like one
from the flat of his rapier brother
paco moved swiftly his cassock was
swept back over steel belted under it
and a good blade winked and rang
against espadins own weapon

  oho brother paco exulted art
quick with the steel juanito pepita
told us true but art good with it
that is a thing to know-

  espadin lunged he met a wrist of
iron he feinted and was held brother
paco thrust espadin gave reversed
and layed open a rent in the mans cas-
sock it settled to something magnifi-
cent the squat man was a magician
grandee or rake man of honor or vaga-
bond juan espadin had never met this
burly ones equal the skill of a dozen
generations of swordsmen born flick-
ered wickedly in juan espadins cordo-
ban blade this jungle friar met it fair

  espadins arm grew heavy the man
in the cassock seemed lighter on his
feet more wicked in his thrusting
then suddenly it came an old trick
learned from a grandfather brother
pacos blade slipped from his hand he
tripped and fell juan leaped forward
and bent with his point at a corded
throat

  brother paco looked up at him but
without fear little eyes danced with
admiring pleasure and he laughed


mammoth adventure

  aho aha por dios-hed spit
paco like a pig pepita where is the
little flower pepita come here this
one will do how he will do i before
long we have fun in nombre de dios-
i promise you it

            chapter iii
            for fortune

t the supper fires pepita reap-
peared with a thin white faced old
man had he been without his robes of
office espadin would have known fa-
ther montesanto the man made espa-
din uncomfortable there was that much
of goodness about him pepita gentlest
of this company was near to being a
witch for the bitterness in her and
paco-at-even a saint does not learn
such mastery of living steel without
consorting with the devil in the learning
of it among the round hundred other
faces about the fires were many wolves
and few sheep violence and unrequited
wrongs burned close to the surface of
them all

  yet when the good bishop came
among them harsh tongues were silent
and rough hands turned gentle as-
suredly he was a man beloved

  the father had barely seated himself
when his eyes fell upon espadin

  i see a new face tonight my daugh-
ter he said pepita bent forward and
spoke quietly in his ear the old man
nodded and his voice was touched with
gentle reproof when he spoke again

  these are times to try us all my
son he said we built the king a
city and he has used our labor to re-
ward men of evil but violence will not
counter violence and a sword may not
save a mans soul give yourself to the
keeping of our brother paco he will
instruct you in our ways and the meat
of our prayers-

  when the fires began to die and most
of the banished citizenry of nombre
turned to pallets in the brush espadin
grew restless his belly was full but
his pockets empty he circled the
clearing and came to the huge tree un-
der which an altar had been raised the
good fathers chapel he eyed it won-
dering what manner of men these people
of nombre were who looked to a feeble
old man for revenge and turned their
hands to chapel building when the one
road to salvation must lie in blood and
ringing steel through the streets of the
city from which they had been driven

  why do we hide here when the road
is plain he asked

  pepita raised one shoulder listlessly
  consult with paco-

  it was a flat enough rebuff but it
seemed there was a flash of kindness in
the deep eyes the barest reflection of
his own ready ardor it gave him heart

  paco-guala-a great one with a
sword i dont deny but lacking in
charm i come to you-

  i have seen as much she answered
quietly art a cavalier juan espadin
a figure of a man and a fine gay devil
ill not say you no to that but it is
as nothing with me how can water
come from a dry well my heart is
dead

  juan snorted in half anger

  the warm blood of castile cannot
thin so much in ten generations in these
sun-blasted seas let alone one the
heart of a woman of spain dead because
jackals burrow in a heap of stones like
the town at our backs you only think
it but i match the thought ill
trade the head of a cursed lozan for
every kiss

  the girl suddenly ceased to be pepi-
ta she was again rosalia de ardenas
her proud eyes flashed sombre fire and
espadin saw deep into her grief

  i will trade with any man who will
the cassock and the sword



bring me my father-out of the in-
quisition of the lozans

che was gone then and juan stared
moodily at the night a man was
a fool to bargain with a woman he
was bested at the start to bring a man
from the chambers of the inquisition
was no fair trade what woman could
be worth the risk yet his mind fell to
thinking of some artifice by which it
might be done and he was powerless to
halt the thought

  a moment later a hand touched his
arm and paco spoke softly beside him

  find another woman and talk with
her that paco will not hear but
with pepita i am always close it is a
thing you should know jaunito

  it was a real enough warning such
devotion to the fair was unseemly in a
man of holy office and an espadin was
not one to brook inteference in affairs
of heart

  art a lusty man for a friar jaun
said savagely

  paco looked hurt

  juanito i have thought we should
soon have a talk he said sadly re-
member that i tell you things only pe-
pita knows first i am in truth no
friar when the lozans first arrived at
nombre my business did well for it
was one which thrived on disorder

  juan smiled thinly

  a cut-throat and a picker of pock-
ets he guessed shrewdly paco spread
his hands deprecatingly but he
grinned

  say better-a modest thief he sug-
gested however i touched the wrong
purse the lozans set a price on my
head i was cornered but one of their
frocked jailers for the inquisition was
at hand he suffered accident i took
his robe fleeing as a friar and hotly
pressed i passed the house of felipe
d ardenas i thought the house empty

but a girl beckoned from its door i
followed and she showed me a way
through the city wall into the jungle
here in the swamp i would have bar-
gained for a change of clothing but
father montesanto saw me too soon

  god witness it you should have seen
his joy that another man of the cloth
had joined him he did not even ask
me my order he needed help pepita
to whom my life was owing begged i
give it what could a man do thus
paco became a man of faith since
while the good father talks most earn-
estly with el senor dios pepita and
myself make certain small forays on
nombre which feed our hatred and the
bellies of the good fathers flock at the
same time but nombre is still in the
hands of that cursed family they sack
it as no englishman has yet dared to
do and we strike no real blow in re-
turn

  paco wiped at his broad red forehead
with the wide sleeve of his cassock

  i tell to you i am sick on it do 
look like a man whose legs are cut for
skirts no and this cursed robe
scratches like a bed of husks a cas-
sock over good steel-i tell you there
must be an end why not tonight
we are men of a kidney we go to
nombre eh two blades honed for
lozan guards we go behind the walls
of the cathedral we slit the throats of
scoundrels hiding in robes not even so
honest as mine and we bring pepita
her father back a man could sleep
better then eh

juan scowled paco made it live in
words-a fit foray for two bright
swords but where was the profit as-
suredly pepita had offered an exchange
for her father and a man could find
much joy in the face of a grateful
woman but beauty would not feed a
man nor found a fortune


mammoth adventure

  pacos eyes narrowed his face was
still genial but his eyes turned sly

  yell not go juanito he asked in
mock astonishment not even for a
treasure locked in nombre

  this ill-assorted friar had mentioned
treasure before the treasury of the
old city the hiding place of which fe-
lipe de ardenas would not reveal even
before torture perhaps the former cap-
tain of the guards now had enough of
torture having been offered a trade
by the daughter it was possible a
shrewd man might make another with
the father the treasure of old nombre
would handsomely replace the modest
funds with which juan had parted on
shipboard it was the curse of the es-
padins to be hasty in all things-even
with no for an answer a man should
consider things well juan shrugged
you have a plan

  pacos grin gave way to hearty open
laughter

  ail juanito juanito art as much
a dog as paco he roared ye sport
silk and sweet smells and a jewel in the
hilt of your steel but yed be no differ-
ent man in the rags of a brigand a
plan seguro the inquisition lies in
an old building back of the cathedral
it is dark of the moon and guards will
not be many i think then there is
my robe however far it takes us we
will go as friar and friend after that
-quick steel hard thrusting and swift
retreat when we have felipe de arde-
nas out of that cursed prison we talk to
him of golden bars you see it so
juan nodded not without uneasiness
it was not the nature of a cordoban to
take anothers planning for a risky
nights work but this could not be
otherwise paco knew nombre

jcspadin followed the friar through
a gate into a courtyard back of the
great buttresses which shored up the

rear wall of the catedral de nombre de
dios a dark walled yard closed at its
lower end by a darker building here
was the inquisition built in the days
when madmen were masters of the colo-
nial church and for the express purpose
of converting unbelievers by all the im-
plements of torture known to savage
man the evil of the practice yet clun
to the building here was proof of the
bloody tyranny of the lozan s-the an-
cient building reopened and its forget-
ten tortures put to their own use

  paco nudged his arm

  walk softly juanito he whis-
pered the bones of a thousand here-
tics lie beneath these stones ive no
relish for adding ours to the lot

  juan nodded half across the court
a man in priests robing rose from a
cluster of stone seats

  pax vobiscuml paco offered aloud

  pax vobis cum the man in the
robe replied and he moved on toward
the courtyard gate paco whispered
with glee

  fortunate i am a learned man he
boasted were it not for that latin
yon black imposter might have raised
an alarm i must learn more of the
magic tongue when we return to the
swamp-and father montesanto

  the language of a dead race seemed
a flimsy defense especially when the
rescue of another and a chance at for-
tune lay in the balance but juan made
no protest the robed man-priest or
masquerading whelp of the lozans
whichever he might be-appeared satis-
fied there was but now to make an en-
try into the building ahead silence such
guards as might be within and escape
with felipe de ardenas the sheen of
smelted gold was already lighting espa-
dins eyes when a bellow set up at the
gate of the courtyard the man in the
robe

  hola-turn out-turn out dogs
the cassock and the sword



in the yard-brigand-theives turn
out

  magic tongue juan spat you
charmed him with your learning for a
fact he was a guard the gate is
closed behind us quick paco-back-
to-back with me a dozen kirtled swine
cannot down a pair of good blades
standing in that fashion 

  espadin expected sound from his
companion-a laugh or a stout curse
which would ring well here in the dark-
ness but there was nothing he
wheeled to see paco clawing himself
with amazing agility up the rough stone
surface of one of the cathedral butt-
resses even as juan watched the man
made a prodigious leap from the but-
tress to the adjoining courtyard wall
paco was a dark blob there for a mo-
ment then he was gone-outside-to
safety

  juan espadin who had a store of
such for like occasions swore an oath
which rang like steel against the walls of
the yard a door in the building ahead
flung open men tumbled out one
carried a torch the rest bore pikes
they were deaths heads sheathed in
long black gowns and wearing sack-
like hoods with pierced eye-holes min-
ions of hell would look like these from
the building they quitted came the dank
odor of bloody sweat and agony these
were the iron hands by which the lo-
zans ruled a colony for their king a
man could run from such and count
himself no coward

  and espadin ran he flung himself
against the buttress paco had scaled
perhaps it was anger at pacos deser-
tion-perhaps that the long scabbard of
rapier fouled his legs but as the hooded
devils of the inquisition reached the
base of the buttress old stone crumbled
in juans hands and he fell he struck
heavily and fought to his knees there
just as his hand locked to the hilt of

his sword the haft of a pike caught him
the solid pole of wood rang brazen
thunder in his head and night vanished
into a deeper blackness

chapter iv

cavalier and soldier

jn time espadin had an impression
of a thin cruel-faced youngster
standing over him and a kick in the
ribs which was more than an impres-
sion the face belonged to that dario
lozan whose nimble-fingered trickery
at cards had shorn juan of his moneys
and whom he had castigated with insult
in return espadin comforted himself
that it was but a dream a part of the
haze in which a stunned man lies

  but it was not so his head ached
abominably could an unconscious man
feel pain he forced vision into focus
he was in a damp stone room with a low
ceiling a flambeau was thrust into a
sconce on the wall smoky torchlight
flung unsteady shadows of strange and
bloody machines against the wall eye-
bolts studded the mossy stone dangling
manacles and fetters in one place was
an erect scarecrow of a man who still
clung to pride although his limbs were
bent and knotted from stretching on the
rack

  there was strength and a bravery in
the pain-scarred face which sickened a
man with pity espadin turned his face
from his fellow prisoner just as another
kick crashed against his own chest he
coughed with agony dario lozan
laughed

  art a bravo now espadin he
mocked soon youll be neither so
glib with insult to the favorite nephew
of his excellency governor of nom-
bre and when youve had a brace of
days on the rack youll be no more
than a fair sword match for the old


mammoth adventure

chaser of mantillas whose shoulder you
pinked today ail ill have my pay-
ment and my second uncle alfredo will
have his for his wound

  but most-and i tell you this out of
kindness-you will pay dearest for your
boldness noble families are few here
and the lozan noblest of these what
if the swine of the streets and the
jackals of the swamps believed they
also could attack us we must guard
ourselves against rabble dogs so you
shall pay-lest you seem an example to
follow

  young lozan wrinkled his nose at
the stench of the dungeon he pro-
duced an elegant snuff-box juan
caught a drift of scent it was not even
a good mans nose-dust but some fancy
perfumed stuff lozan drew an affected
breath of pleasure in his vice

  think of these things cordoban
he suggested thinly we give you a
little time-to dawn it may be and
you think in good company yonder
is felipe de ardenas who loves street
beggars better than the honor and the
gold of the governors favor if you
think i jest ask him

  dario shut his snuff-box with a snap
of the lid and went out the hooded
devils who had come with him left also
taking the flambeau with them there
was a deep silence in which espadin
felt the throb of his hurts and fed his
anger with explosive fuel then the
shackled figure across the black room
spoke defiantly

  wasted felipe de ardenas said
all wasted your masters think that
if they give me a companion in my
misery ill cry out to him on what
ive been silent to them ha a
cunning trick even for a lozan but
a failure the only ears to whom id
trust old nombres secrets have been
driven from their city

  art hasty senor juan protested

let me but lay my hands one time
only on a snuffing lozan and you shall
see one man in nombre of whom they
are not master

  old felipe laughed unsteadily

  art but a dog at the heels of the
new governor he insisted have done
with your trial at winning me to you in
this satans dark give me peace for
my suffering and have done

  a sob shook the old captains voice
even in this juan felt the ring of steel
which made a strong thing of pepitas
slender body and set her above all
women in his ample memory the blood
of de ardenas ran strongly in father
and daughter alike the old man be-
lieved he was a decoy placed by the
lozans juan could see no way to gain
the old soldiers trust this troubled
him there was stubborness in espadin
he had come to this den of deviltry to
rescue this man he would not go with-
out him the cowardice of false friars
the sanguine torture of a colonys petty
tyrants the distrust of de ardenas-be
damned to them all an espadin
walked no return way empty handed
there would be an answer when a man
hit upon it

  thinking thus espadin slept his
weary body victor over the restlessness
of his mind when he wakened it was
day a vague change from night in this
pit where the lozans used old tools to
break men who brooked their will

juan was barely roused when the
door again opened two hooded
guards appeared with pikes and a flam-
beau with them were two more hooded
also but stripped to the waist in earnest
of coming labors felipe de ardenas
saw these and cackled

  the play is to be perfect eh he
snarled i am to feel pity for this one
and so not guard my tongue fools
tis useless i tell you ill not talk
the cassock and the sword



to this dog youve thrown me fagh
i can tell the hand of the lozan by the
stench which goes with it

  a wry humor seized espadin as his
fetters were struck free this father of
pepita was a hard man to convince
the guards spoke no words juan was
stripped to his clout such gear as
had not earlier been taken from him
was added to his baldric and rapier
and the finery he had purchased in lis-
bon the lot was carelessly cast in the
mouldy dust of one corner espadin
was spread-eagled and lashed on his
back across the frames of a rack the
wraiths of satin who wore no tunics
put themselves at the capstans which
forced the frames of the rack apart
wooden screws turned slowly building
pressure until they cried in their
sockets

  when joints stretched unbearably
juan espadin denied their pain he
fastened his mind on the hills of his
homeland the good malaga in village
casks the ancients and the wise of his
clan who had wed his hand to cordoban
steel-and on pepita the salt taste of
blood came in his mouth for a mans
teeth must shred flesh when he cannot
cry out but his lips remained closed

  in mid-morning dario lozan bent in
the doorway

  hes asked for a priest

  nay one of the bare chested
giants growled surlily not a groan
from him yet-and soon his flesh
tears

  a pity lozan said carelessly i
had hoped the priest would already be
here-one of our own what things
a cordoban dog with such a sword-arm
might have to confess ah well that
for later eh perhaps a turn or two
more but end it there for today a
man should have time for the repenting
of sins

  in the afternoon not even pepita or

the green hills of spain could vie with
agony only hatred could meet the
challenge but there had to be an end
to it there is a limit to all hatreds and
the trials of all flesh a haven of dark-
ness loomed and espadin plunged
eagerly into it

  he roused aching and sick to find
his jailers had been carelessly certain of
the ruin they had worked they had
flung him prone in the ancient filth of
the floor scorning the effort of support-
ing him upright long enough to snap
his fetters juan moved heavy limbs
found them free and felt hope felipe
de ardenas heard the movement he
spoke gently

  not for favor or gold would any
man endure what i have seen you suffer
this day i have mistaken you but i
do not know your face-you are not of
old nombre-

  no- juan said hoarsely -of
cordoba-

  he spoke slowly then bitterly he
told the old man of his fortunes ashore
in this colony of the king felipe de
ardenas clucked his tongue in wonder-
ment

  and you would have rescued me
  i would still juan growled

  for gold tis the citys and not
mine to give freely-

  for myself what is gold beside
thinking of lozans face should he
discover both of his birds flown

de ardenas clucked his tongue again
art headstrong-but a man juan
espadin yet i warn you find no
comfort from hope in this place none
can survive this black hole

  hopei juan spat do you kill
an enemy and feed revenge with hope
santissimo the fools have left me un-
fettered and my steel is in yonder
corner had i a way to keys for your
chains we should carve us a swift way
to freedom or death


mammoth adventure

 keys de ardenas muttered
plies it is not impossible-

rhe old man spoke swiftly juan
listened chafing and flexing mis-
treated limbs water was brought by
custom after sunset and by two
guards one possessed keys a ready
sword-a pair of swift strokes-quien
sabe the plan was made came then
a time of waiting in which espadin
worked and further loosened outraged
muscles he paced restlessly his rapier
clutched in stiffened fingers

  the waiting ended with little warn-
ing the two guards came briskly
espadin earnest of no failure drove his
weapon too deeply into the body of the
man with the water crock and so lost his
grip on its hilt startled the other
guard thrust out with the flambeau in-
stead of the short broad-pike in his
other hand

  espadin caught the thrusting arm
broke it at the elbow with a twist of
his body and seized the flambeau the
flaming torch was a terrible weapon
the mans head shattered dully espa-
din tore a brace of keys from him be-
fore the guard began to fall

  his manacles had cruelly chafed
felipe de ardenas at throat wrists and
ankles he winced as juan fumbled
at the locks but when the fetters fell
away he retrieved a guards broad-pike
and hobbled for the door his face was
a stone mask set in a smile of terrible
joy juan tore his own sword free and
joined his companion in the corridor
outside the dungeon

  the passage slanted upward giving
through an outer door into the court-
yard above de ardenas seized juans
hand when they reached this door

  if there is trouble push for your-
self cordoban he urged if you
make it free without me tell rosalia i
have counted you friend this night it

will carry your suit far with her 

  i ask no mans help with a woman
espadin growled beside a man must
live before he loves we started to-
gether we finish the same por dios
y sus majcstades del espana

  for god and the rulers of spain
de ardenas echoed and he thrust
the door open

  espadin hoped for luck-dark and
a sprint to the gate which paco and
himself had used there was a smoky
flood of torchlight instead and a com-
pany of guards in close rank under the
command of dario lozan and his amo-
rous uncle that alfredo who wore a
sling over a wounded shoulder juan un-
derstood leaving him unfettered had
been but another form of torture the
lozans had known he would try escape
they had been waiting like cats at a
rat hole

  i said it my uncle  dario exulted
the rack was not enough for cavalier
or soldier either leaving the sword
was a master-stroke for a fact if you
buried a cordobans steel with his body
he would fight his way above ground
though his flesh was already rotted
from his bones will not your brother
my other uncle order this pair quar-
tered on the public gibbet now
alfredo lozan grimaced

  the death order is in my pocket-
the manner of death my choice but
first let them sing for a quick ending
it would please my ears

  espadin had enough of this he
lunged forward de ardenas charged
with him the two lozans dodged
back dario screamed at the soldiers
guards surged forward dario yelped
again shaken with fury

  have done  he ordered the game
no longer amuses but do not damage
the heads they go through the city
tomorrow atop pikes as warning to the
reckless 
the cassock and the sword



  this was the end the writing was
clear de ardenas saw it too he set
his back to juans back and braced him-
self to take the first of the guards with
his broad-pike juan flexed his blade
and made it sing a last song-good
spanish steel which loved the blood of
tyrants but before rapier met pike
and broad-pike met lance a terrible yell
rang out

  the ranks of the guardia wavered
toward the courtyard gate through
that passage howling like wraiths from
hell came men of the swamp bound-
ing at their head his cassock girdled
high was the false friar of nombre-
grinning and as wicked as the blade in
his hand

chapter v

corridor to hell

jspadin for all his joy at relief
saw only the brigand juan fought
toward him paco threw wide his arms
as though he did not know juan was
more than half a mind to run him
through

  juanito-comrade of my heart he
roared i come in time

  black rascal juan gritted -
leaving me as a hale man leaves a leper
in time-fagh-hast overmuch thin
blood in they veins come up blade
and ill let me some

  pacos eyes grew roundly alarmed
no-before god no he protested
could i help a comrade were i also on
the rack better that one go for help
than that both be lost por dios would
you stick a brother

  the alarm was sincere and the hurt
look so honest that espadin could hold
no ill will he laughed paco laughed
with him

  make it a good fight amigo he
counselled pepita would nor risk our

company for her father alone but she
begged these wild ones to come after
the pair of you she gained father
montesantos agreement or i might not
have returned at all now is the time
eh we are here we fight and blood
runs why stop nombre is a rich
enough prize for us all

  with the ragged bulk of the robed
brigand at his side juan espadin
turned eagerly back into the fight so
it was pepita who had fanned the fury
of these madmen-pepita whose heart
was dead he grinned widely

  the disciplined guardia might have
stood solidly but discipline is no wea-
pon against the anger of an outraged
people they wedged the soldiery out
through the gate into a square before
the cathedral the doors of long-shut-
tered houses burst open to spew forth
more mild men turned savage with
hope

  with pot-hooks and fire-tongs they
fell on the rear ranks of the guards
here was raw justice espadin savored
this battle as he had none other the
little ones-the meek and the gentle and
the long-suffering risen now against
their enemies juan forgot he was with-
out means and that his sword must win
him fortune it was enough now that
it drew blood

  news of the fighting spread more
men poured into the city from the
swamp among them were pepita and
father montesanto they joined with
old felipe on the steps of the cathedral
the holy man juan had shunned in the
swamp as a man too goodly for earthly
life spoke to the crowd from the
gentle lips of the old father poured a
fighting mans prayer-a plea ringing
with simple faith that the good god was
with nombre and that his hand guided
whatever weapon struck at a lozan

  juan had believed that paco and him-
self gave heart to the men of the city


mammoth adventure

but this was as nothing to the exhorta-
tions of father montesanto in truth
nombre loved its bishop and his god
they turned wilder still those fighting
fools the guards fell back trembling
at collapse suddenly a fierce mounted
company poured without warning from
a side street two men rode at its
head one was vicente lozan who
had succeeded de ardenas as captain
of the guards the other was a fat
man so pompous that he could be only
his excellency reinaldo lozan gov-
ernor of nombre

rphe wild ones bunched against this
attack felipe de ardenas plunged
among the city men striving with a
soldiers skill to organize their forces
riders were dragged from saddle dis-
membered before they touched paving
but the charge was too savage for
clumsy weapons to turn it was done
in a moment father montesanto and
the girl beside him on the steps were
seized flung across horses and the
troop wheeled a brief skirmish and
they were free with their prisoners
dario lozan among the foot guards
flung an ultimatum

  the two were hostages to the end of
fighting all arms must be down by
dawn the crowds dispersed without
further violence certain leaders-fe-
lipe de ardenas a cordoban vagabond
called espadin and the notable brigand
paco-were to have surrendered at the
palace by the coming of light failing
this the good father would be hanged
in front of his people and the ardenas
wench impressed into the household of
alfredo lozan who had spoken for
her-

  a grapeshot volley from english guns
could not have more swiftly cooled the
ardor of the men of nombre they
broke permitting the guards to fall
back across the square to the facade of

the governors palace the bubble of
a great hope was near to collapse old
ardenas fought to save it climbing
again the steps of the cathedral

  i am one who will not surrender
he roared the girl is my own blood
the bishop is my friend but nombre
is my city forward circle the palace
theyll not dare to harm either hostage
if there is no escape for them after-
ward

  juan saw the old mans face it was
a brave gesture but it was not enough
nombres warriors did press on sul-
lenly toward the palace but it was
plain they would fight no more

  that you knew a serving-wench in
that place espadin breathed to paco

  the brigands small eyes lighted eag-
erly

  a rear door eh he guessed
shrewdly no wench and no door
but i do know a passage a risk juan-
ito-and no gold at the end of it

  pepita is there juan snapped is
that not enough

  paco laughed as though a last barrier
was gone

  i would have spoiled the bargain she
made with ou juanito he said but
not now pues we have been asked
to surrender we go then to the gov-
ernor to do this eh

  paco slid into a dark and narrow al-
leyway he found a ledge in the dark-
ness travelled it many yards to a but-
tress by which he climbed to a higher
level there was another ledge then
a tile drain all too insecurely fastened
to the towering wall from this they
reached a third foothold on which a
feeling of great height and hard stone
far below seized espadin suddenly
paco vanished from in front of him a
moment later he found a casement open
and crawled through also a room
took vague shape dull metal gleamed
from shelving juan understood pacos
the cassock and the sword



knowledge of this entry to the palace
in a few moments a man without prin-
ciple might load a sack with enough
silver to provide a months good living
from the cannisters and state goblets
stored here

  paco pulled open a door stepped
cautiously into a long hall juan fol-
lowed him the far end opened into a
stairwell from which short corridors led
to a number of apartments on what
must be the front of the third floor of
the palace a heavy gated grill closed
the head of the stairs four guards
stood on duty at the gate paco nudged
espadin pointing to the belt of one of
these keys hung there the meaning
was clear these guards could not be
attacked without alarm yet should
that gate be closed and locked this
floor would be cut off from the rest of
the house-and reenforcements so
well protected this floor could be none
other than the haven of the lozans
juan nodded at his companion and
freed his steel

  as they had done before espadin
and paco moved as one there was a
clash of steel a curse and one cry be-
cause paco was clumsy-and painful-
with his first thrust before his own sec-
ond victim struck the floor espadin
slammed the gate closed alarm rang
on the floor below guards thundered
up the stairs pacos stubby fingers
fumbled with the keys the tumbler
turned but an instant before the first
of the guards rammed his shoulder
against the barred portal paco spat in
the mans face laughed and twitched
in his robe as though the rough cloth
was again chafing him the brigand
then leaped into the dividing corridors
and tried three doors in swift succes-
sion only the fourth was locked-and
from the inside

  with the palace ringing alarm be-
hind him and soldiers wildly trying to

throw weapons between the steel bars
of the gate espadin foiled his comrade
and bent before this door thrusting
his thin cordoban blade into the case-
ment joint he found the bolt with its
point and shot it back the door
swung wide

chapter vi
not for king or gold

pspadin had hoped for triumph-a
moment of facing four craven dogs
who trembled in their slippers and
showed the pimples of cold fear through
the thin silk of their long and costly
hose a man looks no better to a
woman than when vengeance puts ene-
mies in his hands but the lozans
were desperate and a cowards cunning
is a terrible thing

  alfredo still hampered by his pinked
shoulder and always stupid sat as he
must when alarm first sounded in the
hall reinaldo his fat no longer lend-
ing dignity clutched a bodkin of a
dress sword in the center of the room
but it was vicente and the merciless
dario who held the prisoners they
stood beyond the open windows of the
room on a balcony beyond the railing
of which the square was far below paco
would have leaped at them espadin
stayed him with a quick hand dario
smiled thinly

  art wise cordoban he mocked
but to stand is not enough your
comrade has keys which belong to his
excellency hand them over

  paco looked helplessly at espadin
it was a hard thing but juan nodded
there could be no doubt dario and
vicente would not hesitate to fling the
girl and the old man into space pacos
hand moved jerkily sweating rein-
aldo lozan took the keys and waddled
into the corridor toward the stair-well


mammoth adventure

and the gate darios smile grew wider

  he moved a little and a stirring mur-
mur rose from beyond the balcony
proof that the sullen crowd in the
square could see what happened high
above them and so was watching dario
scowled and his lips tightened

  a hostage is useless when a trap is
sprung he said softly nombre has
not learned her lessons well she needs
stronger medicine than any we have
given her put the old man over first
vicente

  the hand of god could not have
stayed paco then he lunged forward
like an animal even so espadin was
onto the balcony ahead of him there
was but a moment father montesanto
who had stood with bowed head sud-
denly straightened and thrust a feeble
hand bravely into vicente lozans face
that gesture of defense saved the
bishop of nombre a terrible death it
stayed vicente just long enough for
paco to reach him juan heard vi-
centes breath choke off in a sob as
stout fingers tore deep into his throat

  rosalia de ardenas was already
swung from her feet when espadins
crashing weight shook her from darios
grip juan knew only that she fell-
and within the railing nothing more
at too close grips to use his long blade
espadin was put to it to fend off a
poniard in darios grasp and he was
but scantly successful razor steel
split his doublet from shoulder to thigh
and a thin line of welling red was traced
down the bunching muscle exposed un-
der the rent cloth

  juan had no choice before that
needle of death could strike again he
had to be free of his enemy dropping
his rapier he reached with both hands
and found purchase weight came on
his arms his shoulders his back a
weight which rose squirming high in
the air and went hurtling out from him

  a high thin wail sounded there
was an uglier sound from the pavement
far below and a sudden exultant
roaring as those at hand recognized the
crushed body which had plummeted
down among them the square which
had been nearly silent rang again with
men moving toward final battle father
montesanto peered over the railing of
the balcony with a strange look on his
face paco yet thrashed purposefully
on the floor with vicente lozan es-
padin thought of the fat governor and
the keys with which he was unlocking
a gate to send a flood of guards into this
room he wheeled-and stood stunned

  his rapier was not where he had
dropped it its hilt projected at a crazy
side angle from the trunk of alfredo
lozan the man held a weapon of his
own in his hand and stared down at the
weapon which skewered him to one
side ever so little to one side and close
to the lozan rosalia de ardenas stood
white-faced but she did not look at
alfredo her eyes were on juan es-
padin and the great fear she had felt for
him was not yet gone from them be-
yond believing juan understood al-
fredo had come at his back and pe-
pita had come between him and death

ylfredo took a tottering step and
fell juan caught his blade as the
man went down a single stride carried
him to the hall door to face a tall
guardsman plunging in a parry and
riposte then juan stepped aside the
guard fell inward and juan dodged back
to face another the doorway was deep
and of a right size for a swordsman to
work one foeman at a time the guards
shaken and uncertain did not think of
bringing up a long-shafted pike

  another fell and another blood
made the planking treacherous the
fallen bodies hampered espadin who
fought much with his feet then a hand
the cassock and the sword



reached past him a hand with broad
fingers and hauled one carcass away
it came back for another

  each time there came after a little
an approving roar from the square be-
low espadin puzzled at this but he
lacked time to think

  suddenly it was over tumult within
the palace reached the stairs and
climbed to the topmost floor familiar
faces from the swamp appeared behind
the guardia in the hall swords clat-
tered to the floor in surrender juan
turned back into the room then no
single body of the slain remained paco
grinned dusting his hands with pleas-
ure the collapse of the guards was
understandable then how could men
fight under a rain of their own dead
from above

  juanito my pigeon the swamp-
friar of nombre exulted -what we
have done come now swiftly i
once had connections in this house
reinaldo is still on this floor and he has
keys i will know if the fat fool lies-
but he will not the treasure of the
lozans for those who fought for it
juan shook his head

  for me only a small purse contain-
ing the value of five hundred cunas de
oro in exchange for one of like size and
weight i lost to darios shipboard
cheating the treasure of the lozans
for those who fought for it-ail-that
is just reinaldo and his keys are best
for father montesanto-for the poor
of nombre

  paco showed liquid disappointment
no fortune then glory juanito
quick onto the balcony talk to the
wild ones below they have loved your
good blade and we have need for a new
governor

  juan shook his head again

  por dios must you make me over
paco he protested am i a gray-
beard to rule a city put felipe de

ardenas on this balcony and let nom-
bre make its choice

  paco was near to tears

  art the friend of my heart juan-
ito he urged for the love of heaven
take some office where i may share the
glory have been a holy man long
enough i must be rid of this irking
robe or i die speak to the guardia
many are loyal to nombre a sword
makes at least a good captain

  juan grinned

  that much is true father monte-
santo is my witness that your sword is
not the sword of god but what bet-
ter wisdom than to make a brigand
chief of civil guards

  scandalized hurt leaped into pacos
eyes

  juanito he cried have betrayed
my secret-the father heard

  father montesanto turned to paco
dropping a comradely hand to his shoul-
der

  i have long thought you a most un-
usual friar brother paco he said
gently but even god may use strange
tools go to your policia take their
command and serve nombre as well
as you have served me 

    huge relief broadened pacos fea-
tures he mumbled thanks to the
bishop of nombre he grinned at es-
padin and he rushed into the hall
father montesanto followed after him
presently juan heard the fathers voice
suggesting that felipe de ardenas
might make a fit governor the men of
nombre answered with loud acclaim
with their bishop they moved down the
stairs in search of the proud old sol-
dier who had loved nombre more than
life carrying their vote and their confi-
dence with them the upper hall was
emptied when a group of loyal guards
turned also down the stairs prodding
reinaldo lozan along prisoner in their


mammoth adventure

midst

  thus order came simply to a city in
just revolt espadin was alone in a
room with a woman he once would have
taken at a bargain and now could not
the change was a softness in him and
he marvelled at it rosalia de ardenas
crossed the room to him and he saw her
again as pepita of the swamp-a girl
without family whom he would have
courted in the shadows of father
montesantos chapel

  art a strange man juan espadin
she said slowly there is a hunger in
you for i have seen it yet you have
turned down both bread and wine-
glory and reward you want something
more than these

  perhaps espadin agreed with
tight restraint i want to sail a ship
across to spain i want to take the fat
pig we destroyed today to face the king
who sent him to us i want to tell the
king what nombre chose in place of a
lozan it is time even kings learn that
here is a new land where little men are

stronger than the mighty-where peo-
ple will desert a wicked city for a
swamp where there is freedom and
honor for their god

  no more than this-you want no
more

  espadin had kept his eyes averted
and his thoughts on nombre he had
been a strong man in the thin light of
this dawn refusing this woman lest only
her bargain had brought her to him
but his eyes met her eyes now and
she was still the girl of the swamp-but
with a living heart pues strength
could rob a man of much

  the girls shoulder stung the knife-
mark on his chest and the blood of an
espadin stained her jacket but what
of this

  i will tell the king here also is a
land where the women are witches he
murmured huskily above her lips

  and i-i will stand behind you
juanito and smile in the kings face
he will think you a great liar

floating hell

                          by

               henrietta browne

      the ghastly story of the floating devils islands
      that were the prison ships of the th century

buried deep in the pages of the not-too-
ancient history of supposedly civilized peo-
ples can be found this very vivid descrip-
tive passage

  dr ullathome visited the ship to prepare
some of the condemned men for the death that
awaited them he went into the crowded cell to
announce his mission and read the names of those
who were finally adjudged to die one by one
the condemned men fell upon their knees as their
names were read out for death and deliberately
and calmly thanked god that the gallows was
about to deliver them from that horrible and
unspeakable place

  inspiring a dread so great that men could
prefer death to life the british prison ships in
use during the nineteenth century were a blot
on the history of mankind indirectly the ameri-
can revolutionary war was to blame for their
existence

  in the late th century there were  so crimes

listed in england which were punishable by hang-
ing women and children were hanged for shop-
lifting a loaf of bread the british began to find
out that hanging for petty theft was a serious

mistake they then resorted to transporting
criminals out of the country for a time the
british treasury benefited from the scheme
floating hell



criminals were sent to the shores of america
where they were sold as slaves to the planters
and  was added to the government cof-
fers annually but after the american colonies
waged their successful revolution that market was
closed and the british were forced to look else-
where to dispose of their undesirable countrymen
the penal settlements of new south wales were
founded and the floating torture chambers were
brought into being

  the work of carrying convicts from england
to the settlement was turned over to contractors
they carried on that duty under their govern-
ments military protection and they received six
cents per day for each convicts food allowance
besides a tonnage rate the stories told of the
wolfish greed of those contractors and the mur-
derous abuse of their task is borne out by recorded
fact the longer the voyage lasted the more
money the contractor was able to demand and
if the convicts happened to die he could pocket
the money for their maintenance thus a business-
like understanding was established under which
the human cargoes died off like rotten sheep a
report written by dr white the colonial surgeon
states that over two-thirds of the convicts were
either dead or dying upon arrival many never
arrived at their destination they had been over-
tortured and thrown into the sea

  the typical prison ship when used as a trans-
port carried all the prisoners in two huge cham-
bers hundreds of men women and children were
chained to one another and to the sides of the
hold where they remained for the entire voyage
with hardly any light very little air almost no
food and no provisions for sanitation it is no
wonder that most of them arrived at their desti-
nation in a dead or dying condition according
to the records at least one hundred and sixty-five
thousand convicts were transported from english
ports in this manner while the system lasted

  many of the ships were used later as stationary
prisons the success one of the most notorious
of the floating prisons stood several miles off the
coast of australia in order to completely isolate
the success and prevent the escape of any
prisoners a cordon of buoys was moored around
the yellow-painted hulk at a distance of seventy-
five yards any person entering the circle without
the proper password and identification was liable
to be shot on sight

  rows of cells were constructed below decks
they looked more like cages for wild beasts than
a prison house for men the massive iron-bound
doors were fastened with huge iron hasps and
heavy draw-bolts the black holes in which
special punishment was meted out to obstinate
prisoners were properly named these stood in
the corners of the lower deck and can best be
described as small and tapering torture chambers
they measured only two feet eight inches across
the doors fitted as tightly as valves excluding all
air except what could filter through the per-

forated iron plate that was placed over the bars
above the door in order to make the hole as dark
and oppressive as possible a stout iron ring was
placed about knee-high in the shelving back of
the cell and through this ring the right wrist of
the prisoner was passed and then handcuffed to
the left hand in this position he could not stand
up straight or lie down but had to stoop or lean
against the shelving side of the vessel as it rolled
with the motion of the sea in every cell on the
ship the floor was worn into hollows ruts and
grooves next to each doorway by the constant
jangling and friction of the prisoners leg-irons
as they stamped impatiently waiting for the
stroke of the bell that marked the times for meals
or exercise

  although there is not a single case of a success-
ful escape on record riots were of frequent oc-
currence on the success flogging was the most
common means of punishment resorted to as
many as one thousand lashes were ordered and
administered a doctor was always on hand
to time and direct the blows so that a glimmer
of life might still remain

  in addition to the numerous other horrible
punishments practiced upon the success and
other prison ships was the compulsory bath
ten prisoners were scrubbed at once in the large
trough provided for that purpose three well-
behaved prisoners scrubbed with the aid of long-
handled brushes and the salt water which was
made to spray over the bodies of the men there
are ugly tales related of prisoners being brought
straight from the flogging frame with their backs
torn and bleeding from the cruel lashes of the
cat o nine tails so that their wounds could
be cleansed by the steady flow of salt water used
in order it was said to prevent inflammation

  the prison ship is now regarded as a thing of
the past the ill-treatment broke the health and
spirit of would-be good citizens there was no
chance of reclaiming a man once the torture
chambers of the prison ships were brought into
play men became beasts their hearts were
filled with hate for the society which had banished
them from all living things their sufferings led
them to dwell upon the idea of the only means
of escape-death it is no wonder that dr ul-
lathorne was confronted with a group of de-
liriously happy men men who had just been
informed that they were on the way to achieving
a peaceful end to all their torment-on the gallows

  the year  was the last in which these
floating prisons were used public indignation
rose to such an alarming height that they had to
be abandoned these floating hells had served
their purpose if only to prove that medieval
physical torture methods had no place in a modern
penal institution in the modem prison the em-
phasis is placed on reform illiterates are taught
to read and write petty thieves learn useful trades
and many men are given a new lease on life

     it would be quite a trick
to kill the inca but it could
be done  if he fell for she
old gag about lost treasure

  a s the sun rose above the peaks
l of sallac and piquicho be-
tween which lies the castle of
sacsayhuaman little alana-relative
and servant of mama anac the empress
-ran to the great round window and
held up to the bright new face of the
sun a little carved box of rubra wood

  far below in cuzco fifty thousand
people watched the sunrise for this
was capak-raymi when the sun-lord
inti reached nearest to the land and
told the people of the new year

  about the mighty city of cuzco in
the wall openings four thousand sen-
tries stood at attention and held their
brightly painted shields and long lances
very straight the colored pennons whip-
ping and listened attentively to the
music of a three hundred and seventy-
five piece orchestra flutes little or-
gans guitars cornets trumpets and
drums and instruments without names

  when the inca raised his finger to
the height of his mouth every one of
the fifty thousand uttered a cry of joy
for this was the beginning of a five-day
holiday including free chicha for ev-
eryone the chicha was already stand-
ing in great ollas on every street corner
and had been tentatively sampled by
not a few

  then all were silent as the ceremony
went forward-watching the brilliant
figure of the inca his solemn face
topped by the llauto a diadem bearing
two tall red plumes of the pillco-pichui
bird and two white eagle feathers
about his neck was the royal collar of
fifty-two emeralds the size of pigeon
eggs from each of which hung great
topazes each carved to represent the
sun and moon and the fifty-two phases
of the moon his robe was the finest the

dered with gold embroidery in his

anced-which included an axe blade
in the round hammer head

  he looked very fine thought alana
looking down from her window in sac-
sayhuaman and so did everyone today
but alana had more to do than watch
silly ceremonies little alana had just
pilfered a most curious object from the
baskets of gifts sent the inca from
every neighboring ruler from every
vassal prince-from everyone who
could afford a gift rich enough to in-
terest the inca

  so it was that alana was not present
at the ceremony but stood looking out
the round window into the eyes of the
new sun through a little gem in the top
of the box of carved rubra wood with
the bird called ramantzan beautifully
flinging its plumes about the red wood
of the box

  alana was young and darkly lovely
and the thing she had stolen was very
beautiful the room she had chosen
for privacy to examine her prize was
wood-paneled of virumna wood and the
panels fastened with gold nails the
great round window silhouetting her
dark serious head pierced two feet of
solid stone wall to reach the outer air
and light

  into the room behind her strode the
tall strong figure of-was it an inca
no this was a priests regalia and from
the objects in the room this was his own
retreat which alana had appropriated

llre must have come direct from
the ceremony of welcoming inti
the sun again to earth for a year he
was still wearing the condor head-dress
with long golden sun rays terminating
in the sculptured metal heads of jag-
uars in his hand was the tall staff
with the golden condor head he flung
off the rainbow sheen of the feathered
ceremonial cloak he bent over the girl
for she had hardly looked up his cop-

per skin was taut over smooth-sliding
powerful muscles on his bared limbs
the sun disc on his chest glittered with
gems

  why do you sit here mooning little
flower of love why were you not in
the procession people will talk you
know

  her soft eyes looked up at his still
dreaming and hardly aware of his
words though his presence sent a thrill
through her compounded of love and
a sense of peril and a kind of happy
vertigo-like leaning over mysterious
deeps filled with glorious tinted mists
far down

  it is a magical little trinket sent as
a gift to the inca from that ugly sor-
cerer the masked ruler of the manabi
it contains some kind of crypt i have
been trying to puzzle out see it is of
rubra wood tiny and carved beautifully
as only the manabi can carve i open
it thus and upon the soft down is a
tiny golden bead and that is all
what is so cryptic about that is
gold so rare among the wood folk that
they can spare no more for a gift than
that his deep voice was not greatly
pleasing but harsh from long chanting
of the ceremonial words from long
barking of orders drilling on the mili-
tary plain

  then you close the box and put
your eye to the little gem in the center
of the carving you hold it up to the
light    here put it so what do
you see

  the priest stared through the gem
into the sunlight from the round open-
ing that was the window then grave-
ly little one this was never meant to
fall into our hands it was sent here
with our incas gifts to get it past the
border inspection unnoticed it is a
map-and a message a message to
some profound enemies of ours

  i knew it was a crypt but i couldnt
the tunca puncu nugget



make it nut what is the map for

  is is for the ancient treasure of the
bearded ones you know our race was
visited by the mysterious bearded men
an age ago they brought with them
many magical instruments and formu-
las which were left behind in a hiding
place long forgotten or kept a secret to
a very few those magical devices have
been long sought by our wise men and
also by those among us who long for
power to which they have no inherited
right

  would the treasure give them such

power

  yes little one for the bearded ones
were members of a race that knew much
more than we of the powers of earth
and sky and the gods ways there
are supposed to be weapons in this
cache which kill mysteriously at a
distance formulas of medicines that
make men young jewels of magical
value through which one can see-when
one looks as you are looking at the
small and invisible-even living ani-
mals which can be seen in no other way
it is a vast and valuable treasure-and
it has been long sought

a lanas black eyes shone with ex-
citement and her breath panted
sharply as she looked at the scenes of
the micro-engraving and we have it
the place of the magic of the bearded
ones

  yes the masked one who rules the
dark forests of the manabi probably
thinks to steal away a treasure right-
fully ours only luck brings it into our
hands how did you come by it truth-
fully alana

  the gifts wait in their baskets for
the hour of the audience i stole in
when no one was looking and looked
through the things this little box so
beautifully made caught my eye i
held it up to the light to catch the sun

on the gems -and behold the gem is a
window into the world of the small-
a world the skilled hands of the manabi
craftsmen alone can enter

  come little love-we will go and
look at the other baskets maybe we
can catch the one who was meant to
steal this box instead of you

  a rude and sudden voice broke in
upon the conversation of alana sweet
young sister to mama-anac the em-
press talking with huaycar wira chief
aide to the high priest of pacha-ka-
mac the creator of the universe

  the voice in that room walled with
the dignity and reserve of centuries of
polite usage-that room for royalty or
the relatives of royalty only a room
where no voice was raised in anger upon
pain of imprisonment a room where
the wall carvings were set with rare and
huge gems and where the very foot
stools were of gold    into that room
came this voice saying spawn of
supay accursed of inti you think to
have tricked me tumi hayta out of
the secret of the bearded gods power
i paid many strong slaves to learn of
the whereabouts of that little key to
the lost secrets i will not lose it so
easily

  alana sprang to her feet her mouth
a wide o of astonishment for through
the door stepped tumi hayta the in-
cas brother-in-law two of the tall
lucanas of the incas bodyguard
flanked him carrying short wide-
bladed stabbing spears in tumis big
capable hand was a bronze axe of war
a famous champi of the incas fam-
ily facing these three conspirators
so suddenly coming upon him huaycar
had but his dignity his condor-headed
priests staff and a tiny decorative dag-
ger as weapons

 	supay the devil lord of haek-pachac
 hell-ed


mammoth adventure

  but huaycar had his wits and he
stepped to alanas side standing be-
tween her and the spears of the grim-
faced lucanas and picked up the little
box of rubra wood saying-ah this
little plan of yours should come to the
ears of tupac yupanqui inca he too
might be interested in the treasure his
father sought for so long in the map
sent him so kindly by the masked one
of the manabi

  the blood darkened tumis face
with rage he raised the heavy mace but
huaycar went calmly on and how
would you explain my death kayta
you would then have to kill little alana
to keep her quiet and then your two
bribed guardsmen to keep them quiet
and then you would have to kill the
assassin you hired to kill these two
since the inca my cousin is known to
be more generous than yourself you
can trust no one quite a problem
the grim faces of the two fierce lu-
canas men sent from the north by their
ruler to do honorary duty to the inca-
became thoughtful at these words and
they exchanged glances which were not
missed by tumi hayta for he looked
to see if this thrust of huaycars clever
tongue was understood by them-who
were not expert in the subtler nuances
of the quichua tongue themselves
speaking chimu they understood well
enough for it was plain that if tumi
chose to kill these relatives of his to
silence them he would also have to si-
lence themselves

itayta lowered the heavy bronze
mace and a bewildered expression
came over him he muttered-how
in supays unspeakable name can i be
so stupid

  huaycar laughed mockingly that
is a question anyone can answer but
yourself my dear cousin-in-law it
were best that you go now while you

can for i hear footsteps and if my in-
can ears  are true they are the foot-
steps of mama-anac huarca who is
your sister and our empress she might
misunderstand your presence here with
our dear little alana-especially if we
are forced to speak of our mutual se-
cret you and i will confer of this an-
other time preferably when i too am
armed

  tumi hayta had a problem before
him too complicated for his dull mind
he backed through the doorway a pic-
ture of bafflement as he disappeared
through the opposite doorway hurried
mama-anac huarca empress of twelve
hundred thousand square miles of land
and some twenty million people but
mama-anac was not thinking of the
land or of the people she was hunting
little alana

  oh you young scamp it is past time
for audience and my hair isnt dressed
yet and you always do it so much bet-
ter-now come along and you huay-
car you are worse than this little trifler
why arent you down entertaining

  mama-anac huarca my beloved
cousin the guests are quite as aware as
myself that you are invariably at least
an hour late to the audience there is
no one present yet but the cleaning
women must i help them dust the car-
pet for your lovely feet

  oh you are insufferable and whats
more not even polite but i love you
you handsome rogue as much as do the
virgins of the sun who should have
their minds on more worthwhile things
than your own gorgeous self if any
more of our virgins become with child

  	incan ears the indian races of south amer-
ica are famous for an incomprehensible method of
hearing akin to telepathy by which they know
events that transpire even up to hundreds of miles
distance can count the number of horses ap-
proaching in pitch darkness at many miles dis-
tance  can follow a cold spoorless trail for weeks

the inca will have to take some action
must all the children look like you
couldnt you let some other man do a
little sinning you should be ashamed
of yourself how can you face people

  as aide to the aged high priest of
pacha-kamac he in a way was the
earthly representative of the sun-god
inti teing the son of pacha-kamac
himself in ceremonial represented the
inti and officially he was the only man
with whom the virgins of the sun were
allowed contact-their shepherd as it
were in this position he came in for a
great deal of kidding and if any of
the virgins backslid he was always
blamed for the resulting child for all
sun virgins are officially supposed to
be in love only with the son of god
and himself was his earthly vehicle

  huaycar laughed off her sally as he
laughed off the usual jibes on this count
saying well if you love me give me
a cousinly kiss and i will be off to tend
to the preparations-the gift-bearing
ambassadors of the masked one come
from the manabi and many another
spying guest from afar and things real-
ly should look as if we knew how to keep
house at least

lana started up from her chair by
the window where she had sunk in
relief at the departure of tumi haytas
dark and angry face her hand going
again to her throat in alarm but
huaycar what of the bead some-
thing will happen what will i do with
it

  that little golden bead from man-
abi eh i had not forgotten you little
thief-i had only wanted not to alarm
the empress but perhaps you are
right we should not delay in seeing it
well guarded its proper use will re-
quire much thought huaycar reached
for the great woven bell rope and far
off the mellow chime summoning the

guard rang and rang again as he pulled
the rope repeatedly

  within seconds the chamber filled
with the brown scarred limbs fierce
faces and the glittering obsidian wea-
pons of the veterans who made up the
palace guard

  huaycar turned to the empress
mama-anac this little box contains a
treasure vastly greater than its size
would indicate alana and i were just
threatened by your brother i will tell
you all about the treasure during audi-
ence this morning

  you can tell me while alana dresses
my hair in my own rooms in comfort
-and not in forced whispers while
everyone tries to get my attention-
while i must watch every move of the
foreigners so that none of them are
slighted unintentionally you come
right along you large lovely man and
earn your keep by being pleasant to
your empress

  it was nearly an hour later that the
three-alana the little ward of mama-
anac the empress and huaycar her
cousin and a priest as well as a famous
warrior of the nobles-left mama-
anacs chambers for the audience hall

tvtama-anac regally attired in the
long plumes of the pilco-pilcui red
and brilliant streams of glistening beau-
ty nodding from her head a robe of fine
cloth embroidered with gold fitting her
full - blown womanly curves tightly
swept on ahead with huaycar and
alana just behind she spoke over her
shoulder fretful as ever at the restric-
tions of her rank which made the two
young people she loved walk behind her

  that brother of mine gets too big
for his boots now he has threatened
you over some treasure what can it be
that leads him to such extremes when
the inca hears of it he will send him to
the prison at macchu picchu and i for


mammoth adventure

one will not miss him him and his
sneering superior ways he is no true
brother of mine

  i have often thought that myself
mama-anac but it is not polite to say
it

  it is no secret that my mother was
not always discreet my huaycar but
this little box why should it upset him
so there is more behind it

  at this instant they were traversing
the hall of the seven gods a tall and
gloomy passage full of the great sacred
images and their attendant trappings
they turned out of the lofty passage
into the smaller hall leading into the
great throneroom where the audience
would be held

  from the shadows of the great stone
figures from the little hall into which
the sturdy figure of mama-anac had
just turned sprang a dozen masked war-
riors a heavy black mace crashed up-
on huaycars skull as he fell the tiny
red box was twisted from his grasp
mama - anac screamed the startled
guards whirled up their axes raised
their spears or sprang to seize and grap-
ple the black robed masked and terri-
fying figures but the leader seized
mama-anac and held a knife to her
throat immediately another of the
black-masked assassins took his cue
from the leader seized alana their
meaning was all too clear and help-
lessly the guards stood watching the
attackers back away into the shadows
of the small passage that led away from
the throne room the whole affair had
lasted not a minute and the guards
knew that unless they found a way to
act the inca would find a way to avenge
their carelessness in allowing this thing
to happen helplessly they watched
their empress and her little attendant
disappear before their eyes tumi hay-
ta had won the second round in the
battle for the secret of the bearded

ones and he had mama anac the
empress as hostage

utside the great palace waited
litter-bearers to whisk them away
to hiding while the guards searched
the palace mama-anac and little alana
lay in a curtained litter borne swiftly
through the streets crowded with the
holidays merrymakers ever farther
from the safety of the incas protection
and in haytas hand was the tiny box
of rubra wood

  haytas assassins had left huaycar
behind because he looked very much
dead his head peeled open by a terrible
blow of the mace and all spattered by
his own blood-he did not look like a
man apt to talk a great deal about
what had befallen him hayta could
not afford the emperor learning of this
attempt of his to acquire the vast lost
power of the ancient bearded ones

  two hundred miles away lay tia-
huanaco upon the shores of titicaca
the original home of the bearded ones
vast and almost forgotten empire an
empire greater by far than the present
confederation under the incas tia-
huanaco the place of the dead was
the place hayta must go to search for
the hiding place of the treasure of the
ancients among those cyclopean ruins
he could hide and it was there he must
search by means of the tiny engraved
map for the power that lay in possession
of the treasure

  along the great highway of the in-
cas his caravan swung at the trot him-
self in a rich litter while ahead the
larger curtained litter contained the
bound forms of mama-anac and alana
across the gorges on the great waxed-
hair cable-suspension bridges through
the andes alps by means of the tunnels
-tremendous tunnels built by incan
engineers across the masonry bridges
which are still in use today-so might-
the tunca puncu nugget



ily were they built trotted the strong
legs of the carriers urged on by curses
and by liberal wads of coca in their
cheeks

  haytas incan hearing told him that
only some ten miles behind the pursuit
had formed and was on his trail and
the warriors of his brother-in-law had
no burdens to hold them back

  now that his flight was known hay-
ta had a means which would stop any
pursuit along these precipitous high-
ways

  their party numbered a hundred
warriors and half as many burden
bearers and slaves

  as they completed the swaying cross-
ing of the wide fabric of a great sus-
pension bridge the half dozen bridge
guards came out of their little guard
house at the great hair cables end it
was their duty to keep track of the
passage of any party as large as this-
for the records of the inca

  hayta signed with his hand to the
trotting captain of his warriors with-
out pausing in their stride their painted
hardwood maquahuitls flashed black
venom in the sun crushed through the
guards upthrown arms through the
bronze helmets slashed into the copper
hued necks left sudden blood and death
about the quiet guard house

  then swarming up the piled boulders
bolstering the great anchor rock of the
cable up to the round hole through
the anchor rock where the cable passed
-the black obsidian-edged maqua-
huitls gleamed sullen triumph as the
blades cut and cut again upon the cable
that was years labor for many hun-
dred hands-cut and cut until at last
the great bridge crashed resounding
into the deep abyss beneath

  hayta laughed at the swift destruc-
tion of such long hard labor for the
incas glory and signed to his men to
press on less swiftly the incas war-

riors would consume several days of
perilous climbing to pass that gorge

pour days later they rounded the
northern end of lake titicaca pass-
ing now among the awesome vastness
of half-fallen stone figures of the gods
-the sky god with his fierce condor
beak the frog faced god of the rain
past the great grotesque nosed nose of
the wind god who leered lewcfly at
them from where his fallen head lay
between his feet hayta looked at the
bright frightened and angry eyes of
alana where she lay with her adorable
young head thrust through the curtain
of the litter

  fear you the anger of the an-
cients little one

  not half so much as i fear yourself
rash ingrate that you are did you
have to slay my beloved huaycar
who is not a friend is an enemy
little one the fewer enemies the bet-
ter

  you should have thought of that
before you kidnaped mama-anac and
made an enemy of twenty millions of
people can you eliminate all those ene-
mies o master of cunning

  when i have the power of the
bearded ones again awake across the
land they will be either my friends or
they will be dead 

  even if you find their forgotten
horde of weapons and treasure you
will be too stupid to use them think
you they were fools to build such things
that a child-mind like yourself could
operate them i think that before long
your head will decorate a pole outside
the temple

  haytas face grew dark with angry
blood and the looks his men exchanged
at her jibes frightened him for in truth
everything depended on their belief that
he could do with the ancient powers
what he said he could do
g

mammoth adventure

  you are a magpie a birdbrain not
to know the powers of the bearded
ones none will stand before me-and
the place is marked well on the map
you so kindly obtained for me

  if i had known sooner what it was
you would never have gotten it oh man-
with-a-face-like-a-dog

  the trotting cavalcade passed the
great stone plumed serpent so differ-
ent in aspect from the plumed serpents
built nowadays-so different that ala-
na though no priestly student doubted
herself that the great mysterious thing
was kukulcan at all but some other
monstrous god of the past past the
slim scarred beauty of the lean figure
of xipe that was not xipe either but
some other god lately mistaken for the
same figure as the god-warrior of the
aztecs in the far north past the ele-
phant-headed god-and alana laughed
for it was so impossible that any crea-
ture could look like that yet the an-
cient peoples of this dead city had be-
lieved in him

  now at last the vast shadowed bulk
of the punca-puncu the place of the
ten doors-loomed up before them
and the procession passed into its
dwarfing shadow silently awed by the
great beauty and majesty by the
thought of the mighty ones who had
built this place-so much beyond the
power of modern incan engineers to
construct

mow tumi hayta and the smarter of
his men bent long over the little
crystal that enlarged the micro-engrav-
ing on the nugget long they searched
through the labyrinthine mystery of the
tunca puncu and long they compared
markings on the walls with markings on
the map and at last as day was clos-
ing hayta bent over the floor of the
inner chamber where the great old
master god of the ancients stared

down at them from his vast niche with
his ruby red eyes twinkling in the fire
from the sinking sun that struck even
here from cunning little slots in the wall
   hayta bent and lifted from the
floor one of the great silver interlocking
keys between the vast slabs of which
the tunca puncu was built-and as he
tugged out the key the slab tilted on
its pivoted center and revealed a long
flight of two-foot steps leading down-
ward into darkness

  the party passed down the tall steps
the litter-bearers grunting their sandals
slapping the dusty stone hard when the
weight of the litters hit them as they
lowered them down the two-foot drops
of the steps hayta came down last
carefully letting the great stone shift
back into place his shoulder helping the
groaning creaking ancient mechanism

  alana now dangling over the shoul-
der of a burly warrior her hands bound
behind her and her ankles trussed pain-
fully looked at the walls as they passed
through the gloomy abandoned home of
the ancient people the rocks of the
walls were huge many-faceted fitting
snugly together and held there by slots
in which solid silver keys locking bars
with t ends had been driven it was
a method of construction no longer used
or understood the torches flickered
mama-anac moaned ahead of her still
suffering from a blow on the head given
her when she screamed to a guard at
a bridge mama-anac would be all right
in a day or so maybe

  alana was scared and she knew that
there was little chance of the unimagin-
ative soldiers of the incan army finding
them here it was hot and close down
here her face dripped with sweat and
tears she wriggled and the warrior
bearing her sank his fingers painfully
into her leg to make her be still she
stopped wriggling

  they came out of the long dank pas-
the tunca puncu nugget



sage at last into the vast subterranean
chamber of magic where the priests of
ancient times had kept their secrets
their prisoners their forbidden plea-
sures their wine and the tools of their
sacred mummery

chapter ii

ttuaycar struggled back to con-
sciousness in a red haze of pain
over him the face of sana ptaoul the
incas own surgeon bent-and what he
was doing with his fingers to huaycars
scalp was excruciating huaycar mur-
mured must you torture me what
have i done father

  it must seem like torture my huay-
car but if you are ever to seduce
another sun virgin you will have to
have some hair on your head-so i am
sewing the pieces back in place your
attackers striking more squarely would
have left you your scalp but crushed
your skull so you should be glad to
be alive by the way just what was
the shindig about why did they take
mama-anac and alana it doesnt
make sense

  it was hayta he has the map to
the lost treasure of the ancients alana
found it showed it to me we were
going to the audience-he struck to
regain it he must have thought i was
dead

  you certainly looked dead half
your scalp torn off and bleeding a tor-
rent you would have died of bleeding
had you lain a few minutes longer but
i stopped the blood i will patch you
up i hope

  the old doctor squeezed a handful of
leaves between his fingers directing the
green juice droplets upon the great gash
he had just closed then thoughtfully
he mashed the leaves in a pestle and
lay them as a poultice along the wound
behind him stood two of the sun vir-

gins sent by the aged high priest to
care for his aide and probable successor
in their hands were tall black ewers of
water of the glossy glazed work deco-
rated with line figures in gold white
soft bandage-weaving - and on their
faces was grave concern for his welfare
for they liked the big laughing warrior
who had unwillingly become their
shepherd not long ago

  lovely innocent faces thought
huaycar so soon to die it did not
make sense he did not greatly believe
in the gods he served one could talk
to the gods yes sometimes but the
answers never sounded to huaycar like
gods voices and the results were never
anything he would accomplish if he had
a gods power so to huaycar the busi-
ness of pushing virgins into a well to
make rain next year was particularly
unfortunate and foolish

  as sana ptaoul finished the bandag-
ing of his terrifically throbbing head
huaycar relaxed and closed his eyes
but as sleep swept over him he heard
the soft voice of a friend and opened
his eyes again to see kapac tupa the
glorious inca talking to sana ptaoul
with a troubled face thinking that his
concern was for himself huaycar spoke
loudly-

  oh my inca trouble yourself not
about me for other than a sad headache
from the blow i am well the wound
to my knowledge is not serious

  the tall majesty of kapac tupa

  	according to most writers of the incas they
did not push virgins into the well for the rain god
or sacrifice human beings these cruel practices be-
ing confined to the aztecs and toltecs of mexico
and those races under their domination and in-
fluence but this paragraph slipped in-you can
take it or leave it i left it-as the idea of these
races without human sacrifice connected with their
ceremonies is so general but in truth the incas
laws were well enforced and they were infinitely
superior to the spanish who conquered them only
by deceits and subterfuges the incas found incon-
ceivable-author


mammoth adventure

swept closer his rich robes sending the
scent of the camac flower before him
the embroidered image of inti on his
breast glittering and above it all the
wise dignity of the man the gentle cul-
ture that was kapac tupas self smiling
down upon the injured man

  there is a something mysterious
about this disaffection of my brother-in-
law that i cannot put my finger on
huaycar can you help me

  he thought that the bead which
little alana purloined from the gifts
from the masked ruler of the forest
was a map to the treasure of the
bearded ones i thought so myself
when i first examined the engraving but
now that timi has gone overboard i
have another idea i am not yet ready
to declare to you what my thought is
but i too smell a strange odor of in-
trigue about this affair

  we do not have all the pieces of the
puzzle my gentle shepherd of the vir-
gins when we do we will see a great
light in this sudden action of haytas
it does not make sense that he would
throw away my favor for a chancy
affair like the treasure of the bearded
ones which is in truth but a legend
and not a reliable one to my mind we
know they had certain wonderful
things true but we do not know that
they placed them in this alleged cache
when they again left this land behind
them

  huaycar groaned loudly and shifted
his weight on the cushioned couch the
inca said in a concerned voice i will
talk of this with you another time
huaycar you are not yet recovered

  it is not so much my head that
hurts o my emperor it is that con-
founded joke about the virgins i hear
it morning noon and night it was one
of the last things mama-anac said to
me

  the emperor laughed the jest is

one inspired by envy noble son of my
friend you will always hear it till
you are too old for it to make sense
that is a dispiriting thought now
my head does ache

  i have set my best trackers after
the traitor he will not escape no
matter where he flees

  it would seem that he plots further
than a mere excursion after mythical
treasure o panaca tupa i would keep
my spies awake in quito and in the
land of the manabi something may be
afoot

chapter iii

itayta was not surprised to find
subterranean chambers as many
of the greater builders of his own people
built such places-escape tunnels un-
derground storerooms and dungeons-
but he was surprised to find an exten-
sive labyrinthine series of chambers
leading on and on no one now alive
knew where

  the party feeling safe in their hiding
prepared to spend the night hayta
and his chief officer sat themselves down
under a torch to study the tiny micro-
map at greater length for this latter
part of its detail gave the exact loca-
tion of the treasure they sought   
and now must find or eventually fall to
the searching inca soldiery

  it was with vast surprise that hayta
heard from his sharper-eared warriors

  	the tenth incan emperors name before he
became inca was panaca kapac tupa and after
he became inca his title was tupac-yupanqui
inca the first his actual name the last an honor-
ary or symbolic title

  all the empresses are titled mama something
like our queen-mother

  the eighth inca took the name of wira-kocha
inca although his right name was socsoc wira-
kocha was a mythical god-person who created
lake titicaca and is supposed to have built the
cyclopean pre-incan ruins the inca took the
gods name-author
the tunca puncu nugget



that in the distance marching feet were
approaching along some underground

passage

  hundreds of men armed men-and
they are not the incas

  now far off nearer and nearer they
saw a line of flickering torches the
wearied warriors sprang from the skins
and ponchos they had stretched on the
cold stone to look to their weapons
fo them was no retreating they were
too weary

  into the far end of the vast chamber
-gloomy with shadows and eerie as it
was-marched a mass of men fronted
by a frightful figure which made the
already frightened alana shiver still
more with apprehension and eerie dread
of the things that looked so much like
the armies of the dead talked of in
their legends

  hayta was surprised but not so
greatly as one would expect and as the
frightful foremost figure became more
distinct tumi hayta stood at attention
his weapon held before him in salute

  the clutched spears of his nen re-
laxed came to the vertical of their
military salute it was plain to alana
that this meeting while surprising to
hayta was at the same time not with
any stranger but with someone known
to himself and to his men

  that foremost figure stalked on
nearer and nearer but his marching
warriors stopped the foremost spread
out a little in the far end of the chamber
his face was a fierce golden mask wide
mouthed and hideous the face of cimi
the death god-or the face of supay
himself his height was not great but
he was extremely wide the legs bowed
and hugely muscled and twistedly de-
formed his arms hung to his knees
huge-handed and hairy as an apes
tumi hayta bowed in low obeisance be-
fore this hideous apparition and hum-
bled himself as he had never done before

his own inca

  welcome o lord of the dark for-
ests who holds in the hollow of his
hand the lives of all the myriad of the
manabi o visitor from the dark mys-
teries of haek-pachac o master of the
mysteries of the lost underworld-i
greet thee i did not expect to find you
here i came here thinking i had un-
covered at last the lost hiding place
of the treasures of the bearded ones-
only to find yourself already here with
me i have a hostage who should in-
terest you - the mama-anac huarca
the empress

jvtama-anac lifted her rather
sweet middle-aged face at the
sound of her name on her false brothers
lips but at sight of the fierce golden
mask and hideous deformed limbs of the
masked one she screamed and fell
again into the unconscious state in
which she had spent her time since the
fall of the great suspension bridge

  greetings faithful servant the
mysterious and frightening figure of the
masked one lifted a wide bulky palm
in the gesture of peace his deep frog
voice booming and echoing eerily in the
rock chamber though affairs have
taken a somewhat different trend than
i had planned yet there is much for
which to be grateful to chance and to
the gods you see my tumi i sent
that bead to the inca with a double
purpose with it i sent an agent whom
i told to rumor that it contained the
map to the long sought treasure of an-
cient power but i have never been
quite sure of you and your allegiance
for others of high rank like yourself
have failed me through an inability to
realize that i could offer them vastly
more than their rulers thinking you
likewise would fail me i did not tell
you why that bead was sent to the inca
-and it has trapped you into an in-


mammoth adventure

discretion which might have made you
useless to me forever i expected my
agent to tell many of the nobles of
cuzco that the bead contained the map
so long sought but he told you among
the first-and you slew him before he
could complete his work your impul-
siveness is understood and it is my fault
that i did not tell you what plan i had
in mind i expected the inca to fall
for my little lie and lead a search party
here to find the treasure for he has
searched other clues in person before
once down here i would have him-
and after him his empire-in my hands
it is unfortunate that you have removed
the little bait for my trap from his
hands

  the golden mask turned awkwardly
looking into all the shadows of the room
to see who might be listening to him
then he went on it were better we
two talked alone there are things i
must ell you now-now that i know
you are one who must serve me or have
nothing our positions the whole plan
has altered vastly by your action

  tumi nodded and barked an order
to his men they left the great cham-
ber taking alana and mama-anac with
them

  alana said savagely already this
traitor thinks like an inca he makes
sixty people leave the room where he
could himself walk a few steps and be
as much alone but mama-anac did
not answer and alana bent her mind
to overhear the echoing murmur of the
conspiring voices in the distance the
shape and acoustics of the rock helping
her she made out to hear much

  the masked one was continuing his
voice rolling in confusing whispering
echoes

  my friend i have lied to you and
i must confess it the map on the little
bead of gold is false there is no knowl-
edge in my mind of the location of the

mysterious powers of the god-like
bearded ones i sent that nugget to
the inca among other things and gifts
for a purpose i also sent an agent to
spread a rumor as to what the little
bead really was that it would lead
a man to the immense power of the
weapons of the bearded ones but
the agent i chose was a poor one and
he did not fully understand my orders
he told you of the value of the bead
because he believed that it really was
such a valuable thing and that you
would richly reward him you did you
killed him-which upset certain of my
plans it kept him from telling those
whom i told him to inform you see
if the inca should have that map and
should come to this place i have pre-
pared a force of men here to take him
-an army of men indeed

  tumis voice higher pitched yet
could be heard by alana you thought
to test me to see if i would tell the
inca of the value of this map
that was part of my plan if you
wish to think that

jumi was vilely disappointed it
does not lead to the power of the
ancients-it is folly i have thrown
away my life for this is not a good
thing you have done to me

  on the contrary your swift impul-
sive seizure of the golden bead and your
forced abduction of the empress to
keep her mouth closed about the map-
or for what reason you did so-played
into our hands beautifully i can now
show you how to become the inca 
how o mighty friend i will soon
be a dead man if you mislead me again
send that bit of engraved foolish-
ness back to the inca place it in the
hands of one of your men-the one most
likely to be believed have him say
that he heard of its value stole it and
brought it to his emperor in loyal up-
the tunca puncu nugget



holding knowing that his inca would
die if you tumi hayta reached the
trove of weapons before the inca the
dignified fool will go at once to the place
marked on the map taking with him
but a few hundred men at the most

  the golden mask-a sample of fine
but eveil handiwork in the precious
metal a mask that contained a lifelike
image of hells fiercest face-looked a
moment upon tumi with the inscrut-
able disturbing regard of two empty
eye sockets the too-deep voice went
on

  and that place is here-here-
where no tactical elusiveness or skill
will help him to escape us here in
these sunless borrows he will die at our
hands he will not bring a great many
men because he will want to travel
swiftly and an army cannot travel
swiftly for baggage he will think
that your own search for the hiding
place will be delayed or blocked entire-
ly by the loss of the map on the nug-
get-and will hasten to be sure to be in
time to forestall you in case you had
copied out the map upon a larger sur-
face he will believe in the truth of
the map quite as much as you did he
knows a great deal about the bearded
ones from the palace records he has
long sought the legendary cache of
mighty god-weapons

  tumis voice was gloating pre-ex-
ultant with the taste of imagined
triumph and here we set upon him
eh here we slay him and here he
will lie and rot in these forgotten halls
then we march at once on cuzco pro-
claim the mama-anac empress then
we force her to proclaim her brother
tumi hayta as her regent i will be
the inca within this moons passage
master of the manabi-i will be the
inca

  yes it is lucky for us that kapac
tupa has no lawful heir as it is the

greater part of the nobles will come
over to our side against those who see
through our plan-for the sake of sweet
legality had the inca a son our plan
would never work

  i understand the plan fully it is
a good and practical plan

  after you have become regent over
all the confederated quichua you can
cede to me the lands of the manabi
now held by the inca then a little
later we will march on quito in the
north and conquer our only rival in
this whole land after that who is to
say what could not be ours

  your plans are irresistible o lord
of death and life it is also a pleasant
thought to know that the nobles of
cuzco would never accept yourself as
ruler it will be to your advantage
to keep tumi hayta in the land of
the living

  yes that is a good and healthy
thought for both of us my own dark
minded warriors would want none of
your milk and water ways did you
think to conquer or to lead them in my
place to dispense with my own dread
mummery and dark mysterious claims
of kinship with the lord of death so
there is little danger of either of us
trying to annex the others power we
should work well together tumi hayta
so long as you remember who is boss
from the eyeholes of the golden
mask a long stare bored into tumis
face and slowly the power of the mind
behind that mask struck into tumi
hayta a cold and dreadful fear so that
he half credited that the masked ones
claim of kinship with the underworld
was not a lie and that his mention of
his claims as mummery was the real
lie and tumi shivered in his fear and
the masked one laughed at the sudden
craven face of him for behind those
holes in the metal face of the mask
tumi could see not the least glitter of


mammoth adventure

light not the least sign of wet eye-
ball but only a terrible red-lit dark-
ness and deep within him a flood of
cold fear welled up a superstition that
would not down this man was other
than life

  fighting hard against the fear that
gripped him tumi seized the tall black
torch that burned on the table and
held it up to the golden horror of the
mask and then he set it down again
with trembling hands and the masked
one turned away with a mocking
laugh that yet was triumphant evil

  for tumi hayta knew that never
would he do other than this thing that
looked so little like a man wished him
to do

qome seven suns later into the glit-
tering chambers of the inca of all
the quichuas staggered a sweat drench-
ed and dust streaked warrior one of
the lacunas he had been absent since
the flight of tumi hayta he fell on
his face before the emperor his breath
coming in great gasps above him
stood four of his countrymen their
faces like thunderstorms-for disaffec-
tion of a half-dozen of the royal guard
had thrown their whole race into the
shadow of the emperors doubt of
their loyalty it could lead to the de-
struction of their homeland the trans-
planation of their whole race to lands
farther from the center of the incas
power the breaking up of the homes
of their people forever-did any furth-
er thing cause his doubt to grow their
short stabbing spears were poised above
the prostrate mans back ready for the
death blow did the inca give the word
but he raised his hand saying let
the traitor speak

  the prostrate man raised his head
and held up his open hand in the
palm glowed a little golden bead from
his place beside the inca huaycar ut-

tered a low cry and stepped forward
swiftly lifted the tiny gleaming object
to his eye

  it is o my inca it is the map of
the hoard of the ancients this man
has somehow retrieved the cause of
this trouble and brought it again to
you

  the inca bent forward interest
glowing bright on his face speak o
fearful one speak of the empress
and why you have returned better for
you had you brought mama-anac back
to me than this tiny gaud

  i was forced by my brothers to
help them or die when i heard of
the mighty power that lay in the lines
invisibly written upon this bead i saw
my chance and stole it-bringing it to
you-that our kindly ruler might not
be replaced by an evil man like tumi
hayta he plans to use the power of the
bearded ones-which he will find with
this tiny bead-to slayyou to set
himself upon your throne to rule us
all with the lightning of the ancients
terrible weapons i have brought you
the map that you may be swifter than
he and with your armies seize this
place marked upon the map so that
tumi hayta when he arrives to un-
earth the hidden store will find your
anger waiting for him i have run
faster than any man other than myself
could run to bring you this power
with it you can be a greater ruler than
any before you ever was

  you have looked at the map through
the lens the inca had turned to
huaycar where does the map place
the ancient cache

  see i will show you i have another
of the manabi lenses look here
through the light

  the inca gravely held the gem to his
eye and moved the bead about till the
lines invisible upon it became pictures
until the pictures became understand-
the tunca puncu nugget



able places now the first picture
shows the ancient highway running be-
tween cuzco and lake titicaca it
shows the bearded ones traveling
along that highway does it not
yes it does show that

  next picture it shows the vast city
of tiahuanaco when it was the holy
city of all this land none of the build-
ings fallen and it shows the bearded
ones entering the greatest building of
all the tunca-puncu the temple
they built to their own invisible god
the creator whom we still worship
above our god and the inti-the sun-
who is the son of the creator

  yes the map shows the tunca
puncu

  now if you look carefully the trail
leads beneath the tunca puncu there
are subterranean chambers there about
which i myself did not know till i saw
this bead the last picture of all shows
the general layout of the subterranean
chambers and a cross marks the place
of the cache

trom the stone floor where he still
groveled before the inca the la-
cuna spoke o my glorious emperor
it is to the tunca puncu that tumi
hayta has fled with mama-anac he
lifted a pivoted stone and went down
into the bowels of the earth under the
mighty ruined palace of the ancients
what is his strength o man who
turns his coat every day

  the warriors face fell at the words
of the inca for it showed he was not
entirely believed

  his strength is some hundred war-
riors now and more come in from his
own lands from macchu picchu-and
there are too some dark skinned men
from the land of the -manabi

  manabi then the masked one
too angles for this treasure of the
ancients there must be more truth

than i had credited to the legend of the
weapons to be found there does the
masked one think to upset me o fear-
ful one the incas face was scowling
and the cunning mind of the lacuna
warrior knew that he had said too
much

  i do not know there was much talk
among the nobles i was not privileged
to hear

  the inca turned to huaycar his face
suddenly firm with decision this is
a gathering storm during which we can-
not sit upon our behinds huaycar call
together the officers and we will plan
to pull this little brother-in-law out of
that hole he has found to crawl into
there is a certain bad odor about
this panaca tupa the whole thing
could be a trumpery lie the inner
plan looks strangely to me like the cun-
ning twining of that dark mysterious
snake the ruler of the manabi his
mummery his passion for secrecy his
ways of thinking of which i have
heard from spies of ours among them
i would say this could well be a trap
of his-carefully planned you see my
inca did he succeed in killing you
mama-anac could proclaim her brother
the regent

  the incas face grew dark with
anger huaycar hastily went on

  i do not think the empress has a
hand in this but they could easily trick
her after your death into being an un-
willing accomplice holding her they
hold a claim to the throne

  whatever is in their minds your
warning is timely but your caution is
not too timely we will send against
that dark ruin enough sound warriors
to pluck it stone from stone and crush
the worms within before they grow into
serpents

  if they are planning a trap for you
they will insist that you come in person
to bargain for the raniom of your em-


mammoth adventure

press and for alana that will be the
give-away so do you remain here and
i will go to step into their little trap
then knowing what is in their minds
do not bargain but fling your whole
strength against them and crush them
at once just to make sure they do not
trap you i will take along your robes
of office the golden mace the feathered
crown-the whole trappings of your
glory when they ask for you in per-
son i will show myself from afar as
you-and they will spring their snare
upon the wrong animal then all will
be plain before you and their cards
will be upon the table while your own
strength remains untouched how do
you like that plan

  you are more cunning that i had
known it is not a good thing that your-
self should be a priest when the land
needs soldiers one day i may remedy
that

  that day i will marry alana and
be happy if she remains alive through
this treachery

jphe inca was thoughtful but i
think your cunning in this case is
wrong i think that my dear brother-
in-law is mad has no alliance with the
masked one and that there is no trap
and no plan to use the empress to re-
place me with her brother i myself
am going along with this expedition be-
cause i want to see with my own eyes
what this treasure of the bearded ones
is all about it is a strange tale to cause
so much anguish to us i would know
what lies under that gloomy ruin the
tunca-puncu it has ever been a curi-
ous dark mysterious and unknown
place if there are underground cham-
bers and passages i want to see them
for myself

  you should remember good friend
to me before my inca that this bead
came to you direct from the hands of

the masked one his people are skilled
in making these things and it could have
been inscribed only the day before it
was sent to you there is no reason to
think this so-called map is anything but
a bait and a rather obvious and silly
bait for a trap your own riches and
power are vastly more actual than any
prize of the bearded ones who are so
long disappeared into time that we do
not know for sure they had any treas-
ures we would value-or could use it
is to me too plain that the masked
one plays a devious game with us and
such is his reputation

  nevertheless my young pillar of
caution i am going i have not had
any fun for years i would like to hear
the battle cries the glorious thrill of the
shock of the charge the streaming
blood of brave men the feel of a weap-
on in my hands you would not allow
your emperor to scratch his little finger
had you your way what will my war-
riors think of me if i obey you and re-
main here like a fearful woman while
my own loyal men die to pluck my wife
back from a few hundred traitorous
kinsmen bah huaycar there is a
thing called too much caution there is
another name my own brave warriors
will give it if i listen to you i could
not face them

it was that a thousand of the
incas best trotted down the kings
highway toward the ruined city of
tiahuanaco toward the holy lake
titicaca and in the midst of them
swayed the painted luxurious palan-
quin of tupac yupanqui inca whose
actual name was panaca kapac tupa
and walking beside him marched huay-
car his priestly robes discarded for the
glittering weapons of a warrior officer-
and his priests benign smile for the
frank honest face of a man of action
going toward the action for which he
the tunca puncu nugget



was born

  the stone mile-posts each one mark-
ing the number in distance from cuzco
were swung by their rhythmic strong
brown legs and every twenty miles the
party of warriors stopped at the rest-
house for food wine and an hour of
sprawling talk and refreshment

  each night the inca talked with the
officers of the distant palace by means
of the fire-signals from the towers-
and there was little of importance there
that he was not informed of too he
listened to huaycars still insistant
warnings and ordered from cuzco
another force of five thousand men to
start the journey for the ruins of the
sacred city-and at those villages about
titicaca were some two thousand men
waiting to join their ruler thus he
insured the presence of a strong force
if he should need it but panaca tupa
did not believe he would need it to sub-
due the despised tumi hayta

  his rage at the destruction of the
suspension bridges was terrible to see

  night had fallen on the eighth day
when the incas thousand approached
tiahuanaco the city of the dead for
they were much delayed by crossing the
gorges this was the home of the
ancients the lake titicaca gleamed
silver and placid in the moonlight and
the gloomy grandeur of the mighty
home of the elder incas the holy city
where the majesty of a race greater than
their own but now passed into oblivion
struck into their hearts an awe and a
feeling of their own inferior worth

  huaycar counseled that they make
camp and enter the deserted avenues
of the mighty city in the safe light of
the morning but panaca tupa insisted
on looking on the hill of the tunca
puncu in the night it was in his mind
that some light some motion would be-
tray the presence of the men of tumi
hayta might show whether they were

many or few

  they made camp in the kalasasaya
the sun temple on the great paved
terrace in front-the steep walls of the
terrace forming a spot easily defended
-the only entrance being the broad
stone stairway at the western end of
the terrace the mighty gateway of the
sun insured them of the protection of
their god inti looking at the scenes
carved on the single great stone of the
gateway cryptically telling of the pre-
paration for the war with the jaguar
god of the night the assembling of his
lesser gods by the condor god who car-
ries the sun inti across the heavens
every day-huaycar mused that this
battle of evil and good is always present
in one way or another too he won-
dered why the incan stone-cutters had
no longer the vast skill of these an-
cients and wondered if it was that
they no longer knew how to harden
metal to their use as had the ancient
race he wondered if they should find
within the supposed hiding place of the
elder bearded races tools and weap-
ons and magic hardened metal stone-
cutters tools among the other things
so that once again their incan stone
masons might equal the mighty skill of
these ancient forgotten artisans

  huaycar himself saw to the posting
of sentries and made all secure

  	it is interesting to speculate if it was not this
legend of the bearded ones that assisted the
spanish conquest as much as their horse and
armor the incans had a reverence for all the
works of the races that preceded them they were
holy ones and the greatest of these were the
bearded ones who came from no one knows
where and disappeared the same place it is quite
possible the incas had difficulty persuading their
warriors to struggle against the bearded spanish

inca nervously he waited sending
word by messenger down the long sub-
terranean passage the escape tunnel of
the ancient cunning lords who had built
this vast pile-a tunnel that ran almost
to the coast opening in the foothills of
the andes on the manabi territory

  then night wore on and with coming
of the dawn came again the tread of
the marching warriors of the masked
one little alana woke mama anac
whispering that horror in the golden
mask is back now dont wake up and
start screaming just look at me and
dont think about him

  i cant stand the sight of the beast
he is as wide as he is tall-and more
ugly than is possible

 he seems to have tumi hayta
pretty well under his thumb your
brother looks at him as if he was
hypnotized

  he could be at that certainly tumi
is playing the fool for a lot of promises
from that one he does not exactly look
like a man whose word was untarnished
as gold does he

  he looks like a fiend from the pit
for all that he may be the kind of
animal that our religion says really lives
-the beasts of the abyss beneath our
feet we dont know he claims to be
related to the king of death the ruler
of the underworld and who is to say
different

  bah it is lies he has made up to
frighten his ignorant forest people into
obeying him he is just the misbegot-
ten freak from some mother who got
her love affairs mixed up and came out
loser he is a monster-and probably
his father was before him

  but where could such a hairy man
come from there are no hairy
indians

  there are tales of hairy races in the
past and he could be a throwback o
some ancestor of that kind

  but hush mama-he speaks-we
want to hear 

  the deep booming voice was not try-
ing to be secret and they could not miss
hearing

  well tumi hayta our condor has
come to the trap i told you he would
do what we expected he has taken
a few hundred men and rushed to be
the first to unearth the ancient wisdom
it is more like he has rushed to get
his wife and my head o masked and
secret one-but that is no matter
what matters is that he is here where
we can kill him he is camped upon
the terrace about the kalasasaya his
sentrys are well posted in the shadow
of each of the mighty pillars it is a
place easy to defend hard to take by
storm

  he will not stay in that position he
will march straight up to these deserted
doors enter the tunca puncu lift out
the silver key just as you did and come
down here the whole lot of them will
come down here as though they had no
fear i know their minds little things
of no strength

  you underestimate the inca he
will not enter these passages for you to
kill him he is rash and proud but not
that rash

  well post your men when he
comes club down the first that enter
silently then if he calls down these
stairs to know what is waiting you your-
self will call back that all is well the
chambers are empty of all but the
wonderous magic work of those who
built this city then he will come if
there is nothing to cause him caution
if there is a noise of combat and some-
thing arouses his fear-if he does not
enter-we will charge out upon him as
he retreats before our sudden showing
of greater strength panaca tupa will
not live to embrace mama-anac again
he has already entered our trap too far

chapter vi

js dawn brighted the sky above
the mighty andes huaycar stood
beneath the single massive block of
carved andesite that formed the ancient
gateway of the sun and chanted the
ritual of welcome with which the priest
greets every day silently the warriors
stood their eyes on the yellow and
awesome god of the skies and the
prayer had more meaning this day it
seemed than ever it had among the
living avenues of cuzco

  the short ceremony over panaca
tupa called the officers together for a
council of war a half-dozen warriors
left to scout the great bulk of the tunca
puncu a mile away to look for smoke
for signs of tumis men

  in an hour the scouts returned with
a wholly negative report the tracks
of the party could be seen entering the
great ruin none leaving they were
somewhere within panaca tupa
turned to the lacuna who had brought
was born

  can you guide us to the turning
stone within the tunca puncu where
hayta went into the underground
chambers

  surely o my emperor it lies not
far within the central chamber of pacha
kamac the creator

  the inca turned to huaycar we
will have to enter the burrow dangerous
as that may be for i see no other way
to lay the dog by the heels

  i have said be careful too often to
repeat it my inca it could be a trap
and the warriors of the masked one
waiting beneath to destroy you

  bearing that in mind we will spring
the trap-if it be one-upon empty
nothing

  huaycar take this fellow who claims

to have turned his coat twice in one
week and find that turning stone
send him down alone and then follow
after him just within hearing distance
as soon as you hear him speak return
and we will decide what the speaking
meant and you worthless one if you
want to stay alive turn your coat my
way this time for sure or your death
will not be a pleasant one if they wait
beneath speak to them in such a way
that they will not realize we test them-
and huaycar can return with the words
you say if there is no one there  

  but master i stole that bead and
fled tumi hayta wiil kill me at once
he sees me

  in that case huaycar will hear his
words and bear them again to me and i
will know you died honestly but in
case he does not kill you but welcomes
you as returned spy-what then
why then i will have served you
for you know tumi hayta waits below
with the empress-what more could
you know

  these manabi you witlessly men-
tioned how many of them wait below
i do not know master

  it would be better if you did know
for you now if you are a spy how
much do you think hayta will pay you
when he is through he will kill you so
that he will not have to reward you he
is not kind and generous not a good
man why do you serve him

  let me go alone and i will return
and tell you exactly what awaits
below

  that is a good idea now go 
quickly the tall lacuna set out for
the gloomy ruin towering in the dis-
tance the inca signed to huaycar
and huaycar-thinking like the inca it
were better if the fellow did not know
he were followed-set out after the man
at a distance of a hundred paces but
with him went a score of warriors and


mammoth adventure

they went at an angle so that when the
lacuna looked back he would think
they traveled to circle the ruined tunca
puncu

jjuaycar as soon as the tall la-
cuna had disappeared between the
huge portals of the place of ten doors
ran forward ducked his head into the
gloom saw the man turn the corner and
hastened after him behind him came
his twenty as silent as serpents

  into the dread chamber of the
creator where his red eyes glowed
startlingly through the gloom and gap-
ing upon the tilted slab down which the
spy had disappeared on swift but
silent feet huaycar stole to the opening
peered down into darkness no sound
came up-nothing quickly he lowered
himself down the two-foot high steps
but with his back first so that he could
sprint upward at the first sign of at-
tack with huaycar silent caution was
the better part of valor just now

  a distant rumble of voices did come
to his ear but the sliding feet of someone
just below him made him sprint again
up the great steps and hard upon his
heels came the rush of footsteps as he
burst up into the light an arrow shot
over his shoulder and out upon the
broad paving spewed a torrent of ma-
nabi warriors mixed with the condor-
symboled harness of the taller renegade
cuzco men

  huaycars score of warriors sur-
prised at the number and ferocity of the
outspewing attack cast their spears and
at the short range near half of them
found a mark in the bodies of the squat
manabi warriors

  flight was their only hope and huay-
car was not the last as they legged it
back across the rubble strewn wreckage
of the great plaza that surrounded the
tunca puncu and dodged into the nar-
row avenues of half-fallen walls back

toward the kalasasaya

  tumi hayta wishing to show his
valor before the masked one had him-
self led the first rush of warriors up-
ward after their attempted capture of
huaycar had missed its first grasp it
was useless to hide now that huaycar
knew they waited at the bottom of the
steps was tumis thought in ordering
the rush to make good their seizure or
the death of huaycar but if he could
have heard the masked ones great
booming voice cursing him for his im-
pulsive rush out into the light he would
not have felt so proud of his courage
the masked one sent an officer to order
back the hundred or so men who had fol-
lowed tumi hayta in his upward
charge but the whole chase had crossed
the plaza and were fighting and running
down the rocky littered avenues toward
the sun temple before he caught up
with tumi

  tumi hayta returned to the dark
chambers under the vast ruin to find
himself not praised but embarassingly
reproved for his rash action

  it so happens that not too much
harm has been done since the incas
watchers have seen but a short hundred
men-which is about the number his
spies have been led to believe await him
here but hereafter when a decision
like this of so much importance is to be
made consult me your action under
different circumstances could have
plunged all of us into defeat you must
realize my little man that only clever
conniving can wrest the incas empire
from his grasp and no sudden action
like yours will ever do the trick he is
evidently suspicious or he would not
have sent his favorite young huaycar
to see what awaits him here

  it was hard to keep from following
when the young coward fled so sud-
denly i expected to down him before
he reached the exterior of the ruin but
the tunca puncu nugget



he is young and swift and twenty of his
best warriors waited with spears at the
swinging stone

  we cannot live by alibi death does
not keep away for excuses tumi every
move we make must be a planned move
not a blunder nevermind we await
his next move and we do nothing
understand nothing until he ventures
again down here where we have the ad-
vantage of him he is not one born
yesterday that inca of yours

vkhen huaycar arrived back
among the nobles and warriors
the thousand of the inca force there
were no laughs at the expense of the
score-who were no longer a score hav-
ing left a half dozen behind

  the inca looked at huaycars red and
embarrassed face saying dont be
ashamed of flight from five times the
number i am only sorry we did not
expect just that to happen we could
have lined the ruined streets with sol-
diers and caught the whole lot of them
between our arrows

  huaycar stilling his hard breathing
said panaca tupa there are more
forces down there than rushed out even
tumi hayta is not so big a fool as to
send his whole force in a sortie like
that the fact that a hundred were
seen proves there are more men there
than we thought-for the lacuna told
use there were but a hundred hence
there should have been but fifty at the
most in the pursuit

  i think you are right there were
two manabi to each man of cuzco in
that bunch if the masked one is
planning what you suspect he plans it
very poorly call in all the fighting
men you can get on short notice and
we will ready ourselves to take tumi
hayta apart piece by piece and the
tunca puncu with him

  runners were sent now to every vil-

lage within a days march-and huay-
car figured that by tomorrow night their
force would be doubled or tripled

  the scouts and sentries of the
masked one posted in the tower of
the tunca puncu posted in the empty
buildings for a half-mile around the
ruin reported the sending of the mes-
sengers the masked one waited no
more for he saw the prize slipping
through his fingers cursing the neces-
sity of venturing his all upon an in-
creasingly risky venture he ordered an
attack upon the kalasasaya

  so it was that out of the tunnel
beneath the ancient pile now poured a
stream of squat manabi warriors rank
on rank steadily for half a day mid-
afternoon saw some twenty thousand
disciplined fighting men advancing
upon the ruined sun temple by every
broad avenue and by every narrow
street of meaner ruins the inca was
surrounded

  the warriors from cuzco tore up the
stones of the temple terrace-a space
about five hundred feet by four hun-
dred-and built breastworks between
the surrounding columns their sit-
uation was not good though the temple
terrace rose above the surrounding ter-
rain by some ten feet and the impro-
vised breastworks between the tall pil-
lars gave them protection still they
could be attacked from three sides and
from the fourth were only partly pro-
tected by the temple itself

  the squat big-chested manabi war-
riors advanced steadily to long arrow
range and poured over the breastworks
a gradually increasing shower of ar-
rows under cover of this fire the
heavier armored warriors advanced to
the assault of the terrace these their
armor consisting of cotton quilting in
layers of broad wooden shields and
long lances at their wrists hanging the
war axes of stone of obsidian and of


mammoth adventure

silver and bronze the obsidian edged
wooden maquahuitl which was near as
deadly as a sword wooden leg-
greaves bronze gold and silver hel-
mets topped the more well-to-do of the
manabi the nobles and the officers
who were in the favor of the masked
one the whole press were painted in
bright colors in startling stripes dots
and weird designs the metal
helmets were shaped like the heads of
jaguars of eagles and of bears it was
as gaudy and terrifying an assembly
as huaycar had ever seen on former
campaigns of the inca

janaca tupa now equipped in
full armor-wooden greaves on his
legs the quilted armor covering him to
his knees the golden champi swining
in his hand which was his badge of
office as well as a nicely balanced and
well-built weapon and topped by a
glittering golden helmet which fiercely
displayed the condors beak and
covered his face to the nostrils
-was snorting with the excite-
ment of the first action he had man-
aged to get into in over two years to
huaycars constant concern for him he
only growled let em come theyre
only ten to one since when did a man
of cuzco admit he couldnt kill ten
manabi

  but my ruler the whole object of
the masked ones attack is just to kill
you-nothing else that accomplish-
ed he will retreat at once and from a
distance proclaim mama-anac the
ruler and tumi hayta the new inca
by her orders then he will march
on cuzco and half at least of the nobles
will join his forces out of love for
mama-anac that is the sole pur-
pose dont show yourself-and we
can hold out for a day or two till the
men we have sent for arrive and start
trouble for him from his rear they

will get word to cuzco and perhaps
will penetrate his lines and bring us
food and weapons we have of ar-
rows not enough for more than a day
of fighting as you well know if you
must fight fight as one of us without
that condor helmet and gold mace
they are more famous than your own
face you big-headed    may man-
co kapac send his spirit to watch over
you certainly i cant unless you listen
to me

  not for all the manabi on the
western coast will i doff this helmet
or drop this mace and may the god of
all timid people centeotl watch over
you today

  that first charge brought the shout-
ing manabi up to the very top of the
steep ten foot slope the long lances
thrusts picked off many too many of
the inca warriors but the manabi
could not close what looked like a
simple climb and a leap over the
breastworks proved on closer approach
to be an impossible feat and every
scrambling manabi that shoved his
ugly face to the top of the breastwork
promptly got his skull split the dead
at the foot of the slope grew rapidly
in numbers and as fast as they scram-
bled up the slope they rolled down
again dead or dying or maimed

  above them all panaca tupa shouted
and his mace plied as rapidly and as
true as the most battle-hardened vet-
eran in the ranks at his side stood
huaycar his eyes and his quick shield
trying to catch the arrows that flew in
a stream toward the inca in time to
intercept each one

  the charge broke at last against
their iron resistance and the manabi
withdrew out of bow range to lick
their wounds and to plan anew

  the inca had caught but one arrow
in his forearm but the shield that
huaycar bore beside him was a splin-
the tunca puncu nugget



tered wreck bristling with arrows like
a porcupine with quills huaycar
showed this to the inca who wryly com-
mended him on his quick eye but
showed no desire to keep his person
less in evidence

  they counted their dead some hun-
dred and tended to their wounded
night was approaching and of their
living number but some six hundred
were fit to fight huaycar dreaded the
night attack he was sure would come
now they would be spread thinly along
the near t ghteen hundred feet of
breastwork and another charge would
surely break their line two more
such attacks spelled sure doom huay-
car knew-and looking at his emperor
it was evident he knew it too

jooking out over the enemy filled
landscape a dread and a fore-
boding of death filled huaycars breast
tenderly he thought of little alana
waiting in the subterranean corridors
beneath the tunca puncu-and him-
self beleagured here and failing at the
job of setting her free what would
be her fate did the inca fall he well
knew it was not a good thing to
think for the customs of the manabi
are not such as can be thought of with-
out loathing and as he leaned
against the great gateway of the sun
looking out upon the setting splendor
shining directly through the doorway
in the single great stone a little
light far-off in the gathering dark-
ness gleamed for an instant on the dis-
tant hillside-and disappeared in-
stantly it reappeared and again was
swallowed by the dusk huaycars
heart leaped within him for it was the
fire signal of the incan soldiery-and
only fresh warriors of the inca would be
using that signal huaycar hissed ex-
citedly to the inca hoping the too-near
manabi scouts would not notice the tiny

flicker of light the inca swore a great
oath as the light flashed again and in-
stantly with his own hands began to
prepare the scorched cotton for the re-
turn blaze tearing up his own quilted
armor to make the tiny fire needed
which huaycar quickly stopped seizing
the tunic from a dead warrior to kindle
the blaze about the blaze directly in
the center of the gateway of inti
shielded from all points but that far
hills view by ponchos held by grate-
ful warriors gathered the wounded
men and hope sprang in their hearts
as the swift interchange between the
inca and his distant forces took place
completed the light disappeared in-
stantly into the gathering gloom

  the inca turned to the grim faces
gathered about him few of whom had
been able to follow the rapid signal-
ling

  i have told them to attack directly
opposite the tunca puncu it has but
ten doors and our own choice of posi-
tions is all doors it seems they will
drive through from behind the tunca
puncu take it if they can we sortie
from here to join them eh how is
that even at the forst we retreat
into the ancient palace of the dead-
and have our mama-anac again in our
hands and our precious masked ones
plans are spiked

  an old noble at the side of huaycar
raised his voice-a voice that by its
firmness showed the grim experience of
old campaigns when this inca whom he
served had been a babe in arms

  i have been silent all this time
while you got us into this fix my re-
vered emperor but as one whose life
is now in peril as well as the freedom
of some two dozen noble sons and
some five thousand retainers in my
lands outside cuzco i think i have a
right to make a suggestion

  his rather ironical and contemptuous


mammoth adventure

manner did not nettle the inca he
knew he had it coming and he turned
to the old veteran a rich man of royal
blood himself though of another line
saying

  manco mayta my teacher you have
long been say your say

  your present plan has not one but
two flaws you have failed to pro-
vide a means of drawing off the masked
ones forces from your line of attack
i would suggest a feinted sortie here to
the east and shortly after that one a
second feint to follow up here to the
south if he realizes the first attack
is but a feint he will be sure the second
is the real attack and will fling at
once his whole force against the sec-
ond both of these are but simple
good tactics-suicidal to those who par-
ticipate perhaps-but quite necessary
to draw off his overwhelming strength
from your real attempt to reach shelter
within the tunca puncu and there have
the walls to protect you till more com-
plete reinforcements arrive

  the inca pondered for a moment and
slowly his proud head lowered in shame
for what the old man said made of him-
self a tyro in appearance

  i am a fool my friend here take
this mace i am unworthy to bear it
longer

  nay my emperor but hereafter i
would appreciate a more close attention
in yourself to such old heads on young
shoulders as young huaycar-who di-
vined all along this whole thing was but
a trap for your person and a more
close attention to such warriors as my-
self who have by battle experience
proved themselves worthy of a place at
your side in all counsels which may lead
to the risk of their own heads one
does not like anothers thoughtlessness
to cost ones own life when a few words
would have saved the whole affair now
that even an inca has proved himself

not all-wise let us all forget this inci-
dent-for we all love you panaca tupa
but in some ways you have badly neg-
lected your opportunities one of those
ways is in the study of tactics from
ancient has-beens like myself

rjhe inca his fore-arm bandaged
his helmet on his arm dented his
mace still bloody from recent struggle
looked at the oldster like a spanked
child the corners of his mouth drawn
down slightly his eyes doleful

  may supay devour me if i ever
allow your white head to be out of my
sight again if only to escape the shame
of another such deserved calling down 

  the laughter at the incas bearing
under the reproof lightened the strained
atmosphere and the inca went on and
may the god of idiots devour you if
you ever keep your mouth closed again
when i need it open and talking-do
you hear do you think i am too
proud to listen the warriors pressed
closer about the two to hear

  old manco mayta grinned a yellow-
fanged grin at his emperor such a grin
as only the privileged dare give an em-
peror saying you had better spend
your time preparing this next blood-
letting carefully for upon it depends
the whole fate of the inca nation as
well as my own worthless life my inca
the old man with this parting shot
turned and went to the breastwork
where he curled up on his poncho to
await the next need for activity at his
age one needed rest to keep up with
the young bloods

  huaycar    began the inca but
the young priest was not to be taken
again in the net of the incas impulsive-
ness

  oh no you dont i am staying by
your side to keep you alive as the old
man says-our heads depend upon it
some other can lead the feinting sorties
the tunca puncu nugget



not myself wisdom is needed here not
my own youthful intelligence smart as
i may be only your most experienced
warriors can come through such a job
alive and only myself realizes the ne-
cessity fully of protecting you for the
whole plan of the manabis dark ruler
depends on your death

  the inca growled under his breath
but as other leaders in difficulty have
found it necessary to swallow their
pride as well as a few digs he too
obeyed the youthful huaycar and se-
lected from those about him the two
best fitted officers for the feints old
manco mayta had recommended

  at moonrise an hour later they were
ready and none too soon for the dark
line of the manabi front had ap-
proached nearer in the darkness-was
obviously readying for a new charge
protected by the darkness the moon
a thin silver crescent did not appre-
ciably lessen the darkness

  the first party of fifty seasoned war-
riors leaped the stacked slabs of the
parapet and charged screaming insults
as to the origin of the whole manabi
race as the first impetus of their charge
dissolved into a howling melee the sec-
ond wave two hundred more leaped the
parapet and with vast noise and ap-
parent intent to wipe out forever every
living enemy of the incan ruler-sprang
across the bloody dead-littered plain at
right angles to the first sortie

  four minutes later the remaining six
hundred a third of which were seriously
wounded slipped over the parapet on
the opposite side and silently stooping
low raced northwest directly toward
the great shadow of the tunca puncu
even as they flung themselves into the
dark line of manabi before them a
tiny signal fire sparkled briefly from the
dark squat tower of the palace of the
dead telling them that at least the sur-
face portion of the tunca puncu was in

the hands of the new-come incan sol-
diery

plerce bloody hand-to-hand fight-
ing it was axe against axe brawn
against brawn savagery against sav-
agery the manabi a shorter race than
the incan quichuas were yet sturdier
of limb and were no mean antagonists

  the incans lives depended on the
swiftness with which they covered that
mile between the terrace of the sun
temple and the dark ancient palace of
the forgotten bearded ones half the
distance covered their progress halted
the manabi had erected a low barri-
cade of building rocks across the end
of the avenue beyond lay the open
plain clear to the tunca puncu but
across the street up which the inca and
his forces raced desperately was a
solid bank of manabi a dozen deep the
long lances a forest of death them-
selves a solid rank of shields behind
it was break through the living wall or
die and their hearts sank with sight
of the impossible task behind the
inca huaycar heard old mayta mut-
tering-and paused to bend his head
and listen for the old mans breath
was gone give them every last ar-
row from the quivers then advance and
seize their spears in your hands not
a charge just a slow advance so that
the stab can be avoided and the spear
head seized pull the spears to you
hand-over-hand they will either re-
lease them or come along to be maced
to death turn the spears upon them
then and drive home do it right
and you can make it do it wrong we
all die here and the quichua will learn
to speak manabi and our women will
bear manabi children do you want
alana to have bow-legged hairy chil-
dren the masked one has seen her
she will belong to him

  a fury arose in huaycar which swept


mammoth adventure

away all his caution all fear of the

incas pre-eminence in a loud voice
-calculated so that not a cuzco man
would miss the meaning but the ma-
nabi would fail to understand the idiom
-he detailed the old warriors plan to
them

  as one man the fore ranks fell to
iheir knees swung forward their quiv-
ers and steadily all fired upon the dark
ranks of the manabi until every quiver
was empty the solidity of the dark
mass visibly lessened under the concen-
trated fire but they had not a shaft
left among them

  they tossed aside their bows and
now sprang forward stopping just
short of the line of bronze spearheads
first one then another tempted a
thrust by starting forward dancing
back as the long lances reached for
them only to be seized by another
watching and ready once seized a
half-dozen hands grasped t h e spear
shaft and pulled head-over-heels the
luckless warrior from behind the barri-
cade

  just like trout from the stream
exulted huaycar like shooting fish
in a cask aye grinned mayta at the
simple effective strategy from be-
hind the lancers flung bronze hatchets
dropped some few incans and a few
well-directed arrows pierced the quilted
armor there were now but half the
six hundred with them and those sore
wounded

  they would have won through and
the inca was bellowing the battle cry
for the last desperate all-out charge
they might have hammered this stub-
born barrier of bow-legged manabi flesh
into blood and bones before them had
not there arisen before them at that
moment a frightful apparition

  from among the squat and weary
warriors retreating stubbornly before
them a wide lane appeared among the

manabi as they were shoved right and
left by powerful too-long arms came
the masked one-the son of death
he called himself he truly looked it
now h i s great head encased in the
golden horrific mask the false mouth
tusked and snarling the hinged jaw
opening with his fierce breath-and in
the two round eyeholes the red flicker-
ing rage from within was a fire of doom
a fire of fear that struck every brave
man that looked upon him with strange
awe that shivering terror that only the
supernatural suddenly made manifest
can bring

qut before the shattered remnants
of the slaughtered barrier of flesh
he had built so carefully to stop their
last effort at escape stalked this door-
wide figure his battle harness all gleam-
ing gold like his fearfully wrought hel-
met one ape-strong arm swinging a
great two-bladed bronze axe and in his
other hand a heavy too-long maqua-
huitl that no other warrior would have
attempted to handle with two hands
thus doubly armed h i s immense
twisted and unhuman limbs terrifying
in their weirdly sudden appearance be-
fore them stalked the masked one
here was the feared mysterious leader
of the manabi whom his followers be-
lieved to be a son of the lord of the
underworld the son of the death-god
himself

  meet me o braggart kapac tupa
you who falsely hold the title yupanqui
inca-meet me or forever be branded
coward and unfit to lead anv man to
battle

  in the incan code of honor there was
no other course open to the inca for
all rulers must first prove their valor
and worth to lead brave men upon the
battlefield before they are even con-
sidered claimants to the throne they
must likewise keep this reputation for
the tunca puncu nugget



courage untarnished or an election
among the nobles would create a suc-
cessor a successor whom all men who
hold courage and honor dear would
choose automatically as their ruler the
inca did not hesitate for to hesitate
here would be as final as an abdication
as his men drew back as the manabi
lowered their weapons the inca stalked
forward toward this apparition of su-
perhuman ugliness his hairy limbs look-
ing to kapa tupa like the limbs of some
spider the frightful golden masking
helmet like nothing so much as his own
skull not far in the future

  it was this meeting which huaycar
had dreaded-and knew the masked
one would bring about if he could-for
no such warrior had ever appeared no
warrior so capable and so strong among
the incas or their neighbors for cen-
turies if all reports about him were
true

  the inca armed only with his golden
mace in his right hand and a heavy
round target of wood in the other
closed with the fearful figure cautiously
knowing that one square blow from
either of the weapons in the huge hands
of the monster would be his end

  the masked one whirled up the
double bladed axe and sent it crashing
down upon the incas helmet but the
inca caught it on slanted shield flung
the blow aside and countered with a
roundhouse swing of the heavy mace
directed square at the center of the wide
bulk the inca was well trained and
canny knew that a blow at his wind
would cripple him more than to break
an arm the masked horror caught
the mace on his broad maquahuitl
grunting with the force as he parried
the blow and the mace shot past his
belly

  still carrying the momentum of its
original swing the inca arced the mace
up and around and down upon the great

gold mask the hairy arm carrying the
axe got the thick haft of his axe under
the down swing of the mace the haft
splintered as the mace slid down the
length of it to smash against the great
fist 

  the monster howled with pain and
the axe chopped in a short arc forward
into the incas fiercely grinning face

phe incas round shield broke the
force of the blow but the sharp
blade drew blood as it touched his chin
with the last spent force without pause
the sword-like maquahuitl whirled in
from the side and again the target in
the incas hand jaught the blade but
it bounded from the shield in a glancing
blow to his leg the inca gave a cry
of pain his knee would never be the
same supay would have this hairy
son of his back in short order if a curse
could do it

  in a red haze of anger the inca
whirled the heavy mace in alternate
continuous back hand and forehand
the giant squat figure gave ground
steadily the fierce unnatural glow
within his helmet flickered as he ducked
and parried parried and ducked the
inescapable golden head of the big ham-
mer a hammer with one end a razor-
edged axe

  huaycar was astounded that the inca
could give trouble to the huge masked
horror he had often watched the
emperor in desultory practice but had
never seen him in battle before he
realized now that all the praise of his
battle prowess was not flattery by far

  but the inca was weary with the
long leg-pounding drive from the sun
temple through the death-laden ruins
was ready for rest before they had even
seen the masked one the huge figure
was fresh unwearied had not before
raised weapon that night

  the steady arc and swing of the


mammoth adventure

incas shining weapon slowed he
paused and took the defensive

  time was dragging on they could
not wait for they heard footsteps of
approaching men of the masked one
grow ever more frequent they would
be surrounded

  honor be damned the masked one
was merely delaying the fight taking no
chances waiting till they were sur-
rounded fully when his arrows would
plunge among them huaycar took de-
cision again into his hands shouted at
the top of his young lungs we are
cheated the manabi advance behind
us to take us forward

  realizing they were allowing the code
of the warriors to dupe them all to
death the incas warriors swung their
maquahuitls their axes lifted their
short-bladed stabbing spears of bronze
lanced forward between the inca and
his opponent the inca cursed them all
as they swept him on through the now
open ranks of the manabi-and the
suddenness of their advance gave them
freedom two-score men died before
their sudden flashing blades and they
were through the great plaza of the
tunca puncu lay empty before them
and in the squat tower blazed the fire
of the inca signal men

  their feet pounded now hopefully
behind them the bowlegged manabi ran
hard but their short legs were not built
to catch the slender limbs of the men
of cuzco in a race

  they sprinted into the dark shadows
of the great southern doorway of the
place of ten doors and into the arms
of a mass of shouting warriors and
nothing was ever so glad a sight as the
little shoulder-symbol condor heads of
gold that marked the armor of the
incas army nothing so good as to
hear around them good round quichua
words instead of the dog-barking of
the manabi tongue

  as huaycar leaned wearily against
the great round pillars of the huge door-
way a flying little bundle of soft flesh
of weeping and laughing and talking all
at once of sweet smelling hands caress-
ing his face of welcoming lips upon his -
owm of flying hair that insisted on cov-
ering his eyes of clinging limbs that
somehow climbed upon him until he was
holding her like a mother holds a child
-all flung themselves upon huaycar
out of the darkness

  among other things alana said i
never thought i would be so glad to see
anybody as your own battle-gloomy
face and tall too-attractive self i
never knew till now how much i loved
you huaycar never let me go again
never never that monster the
masked ape of hell oh he looked
and looked at me and his men laughed
knowing what he meant to do with me
ill never tell you not i oh poor
mama-anac she fainted every time he
crossed her vision the poor woman has
been unconscious half the time she
has honest to inti she has the only
reason i didnt pass out i was afraid
too for fear of what might have hap-
pened to me when i wtoke up and me
not know i was dead its a dreadful
feeling not knowing when theyre going
to kill you day after day that tumi
hayta the snake kill him before this
is over huaycar kill him deader than
this old hole tiahuanaco for me

 huaycar got the hair and
kisses out of his eyes for the first
time he saw that yupanqui inca was
likewise engaged with the more rotund
mama-anac and seemingly very happy
about it

  little alanas voice went right on
telling everything at once with ges-
tures and kisses and words all inter-
mingled

  when the men came from hualla
the tunca puncu nugget



and chawin and the other villages and
gathered on the hill of tiaspnac over
there and got the incas signal and
came here they found the old door to
the down-stairs guarded by only two
sentries they killed them and sneak-
ed down into the underground and now
they hold the tunnel that the manabi
came here through that nobody knew
about but that musty old side-of-a-barn
the masked one-and he is one who
knows all about the underworld having
come from there anyway they drove
the soldiers he left to hold the tunnel
up the tunnel and are holding them
there-and tell me how are those ugly
manabi going to get home

  grimly the inca overhearing the
chattering sweet voice answered
they will get home as spirits little
alana just spooks thats all with-
in two days there will not be one of all
that force alive i swear it

chapter vi

rjhe masked one was a raging fury

   he realized that now his escape tun-
nel was blocked the whole barrier of
the mighty andes cut him off from his
own trackless forests and safety he
knew that but two days or so more
would bring from cuzco the vast
strength of the incan army that his
time was running out-that whatever
luck he may have had was now only
bad

  that fury he expended in assault
upon assault upon the immovable walls
of the massive tunca puncu those
cyclopean slabs of rock pierced by ten
great doorways saw fiercer fighting
now in the dull days of their ruin than
ever they had seen in the period when
they had been the mighty home of a
greater race than the incas hordes

  fruitless hopeless assaults they were
marked by the death of the brave

strength of the squat courageous people
who called the masked one their lord

  each of those ten doors was racked
by a continuous shower of the short
red arrows of the manabi and under
that canopy of arrow fire the warriors
charged again and again-to be flung
back by the savagely plied axes spears
and maquahuitls of the men of cuzco

  the day wore on and after each
bloody attempt the manabi withdrew
seemingly convinced of the futility of
piling their dead before those sombre
age-old portals a curse was on the
place they muttered it was protected
by the holy dead who were punishing
the manabi for their profaning of the
place of the dead

  night came again and the silver
crescent of the moon rode peacefully
over the bloody scene the moans of the
dying before the ten doors the cry of a
hunting jaguar among the far ruins
and the fierce mocking calls of the in-
cans to the hovering army of the
masked one to come and be killed

  day again and the watch in the squat
tower of the tunca puncu reported that
the dawn-fire signals along the incan
highway had stated the army from
cuzon would arrive sometime soon after
noon

  themselves had lost men sheltered
though they were behind the thick walls
the fresh thousand plus their own five
hundred who had lived through the
flight from the kalasasaya now joined
within the ancient place numbered
again among the living but a few more
than the thousand nearly a thousand
warriors had died in defense of the
inca and of the masked ones horde
one guessed but half remained for his
losses were ghastly

  with the suns advent the fruitless
assault began again the whistling ar-
rows fell among the warriors at the
doors like rain and their own arrows


mammoth adventure

hoarded desperately were now held
against the last resort

  this morning the wide and terrifying
figure of the masked ruler led the as-
sault in person he had heard from
his own scouts of the nearing over-
whelming force of men on the march
from cuzon knew that it was now or
never with him

  a long crescent of bow-twanging war-
riors ringed each of the ten doors of the
tunca puncu a crescent that tried con-
tinually to close tight and crush in upon
the beleaguered inca warriors-and
failed their steadily raining arrows
took a deadly toll of the decreasing
strength of the defenders but the
tunca puncu was built to perfection for
their need ten men could hold each
door against an army equipped as these
and the greater part of the constant
flight of arrows they caught on shield
or spent themselves in the thickness of
the quilted armor over their thighs

t the huge central portal of the
ancient palace the greatest number
of manabi concentrated and it was
here that the mighty and frightening
ugliness of the masked one boomed
his battle cry and led his chosen in
charge after charge against the de-
fenders only to bring up short against
the lances of the incan nobles

  that deep frog voice of the masked
one rolled steadily reviling the inca
kapac tupa for a coward and poltroon
one who dared not meet again the one
who had yesterday nearly killed him
meet him in honorable combat to his
repeated challenge the inca derisively
jeered his answer that soon his horde
would be laid low and that then he
would meet the masked one where his
own forces would insure fair play and
no tricks from the lying braggart who
claimed what was an obvious lie-that
he was a relative of the supernatural

lords of the underworld of the dark
that he himself was immortal here on
earth only for amusement which
obviously was not true as the masked
one was not enjoying himself but ap-
peared to be in great trouble and per-
plexity and could get none of his plans
to come right for that matter it
could be true that the gods of the dark
had tired of his bombast and had sent
him to earth and it was kind of them
for he kapac tupa was enjoying the
affair immensely

  at the close of each of these inter-
changes of mutual insults the masked
one would go into a rage and rush for-
ward whirling his great two-bladed axe
only to be stopped by the out-thrust
lances or pinked by one of the few ar-
rows the cuzco men had left in their
quivers

  huaycar standing beside the inca
with his shield steadily catching arrows
intended for the royal person shivered
at the raw power in the monsters limbs
at each of these charges and knew that
did he manage to break their defense not
a man would live slaughter would be
short and complete

  after each raging charge the masked
one and his bow-legged crew would
withdraw taunting them all for cow-
ards women afraid to come out and
fight and time and again huaycar drew
back the inca from accepting his chal-
lenge

  inti the sun rose steadily higher
stood at last directly overhead the
watch in the tower of the tunca puncu
called down that the gleam of weapons
and the color of the head plumes of the
armies of the inca coming at the trot
were in sight on the great highway

  the masked one too enraged to con-
sider flight made one last desperate
attempt to win again the safety of the
mighty ancient stone walls of the tunca
puncu-and the escape through his
the tunca puncu nugget



no-longer secret tunnel

  placing his men in a long column be-
fore the huge main door protecting
their front with a solid rank of shields
he tried to crush through the door by
main force regardless of the death of
his men the plan entailed

  in plunged the head of the huge spear
of flesh and flashing axe heads of gaudy
shields splitting against the lances of
the incas who ground the butts of the
hafts and let the manabi impale them-
selves upon the bronze points only to
replace the entangled spears with new
a little further inward steadily the
awful crush pushed in    in the
screams of the dying were a terrible
sound of death agony rising higher and
higher as the manabi trampled inward
driven by the fear of the now visible
approaching column of soldiery from
cuzco driven by the horrible shouts of
their leader whose terrible axe steadily
hewed a path for them through the
bodies of the incan warriors back
back the battle was now in the deep
gloom of the interior of the temple the
defense was broken and spreading out
within the vast chamber from the great
central doorway the manabi were
swiftly evening the score tipping the
scales of death with steadily plying
axes and maquahuitls herding the hard
pressed quichua warrior before them
and ever over the heads of the foremost
showered the short red arrows of the
stumpy manabi bowmen back back
into the inner chambers of the ancient
house of the long dead

    apac tupa seeing at the last mo-
ment his triumph over this gold-
masked horror slipping from his grasp
called an order and his words picked
up by his desperately fighting men
were shouted again and again through
all the hard pressed line giving for each
backward step its exacted payment of

blood and paying steadily with wounds
and death for the privilege

  to the tunnel-to the tunnel-down
through the turning stone

  suddenly all resistance ceased and
the last few hundred incan warriors
turned as one man and sprinted for the
gaping opening in the great central
chamber which led to the masked ones
tunnel under the andes to his own land
on the coast

  about the dark hole they formed
again a solid square of wooden shields
of ready maquahuitls of flickering lance
thrusts nearly every man of them
wounded and each conscious of the loss
of brother and comrade-they were a
sight to strike terror to stronger hearts
than the manabi who are fishermen
first forest hunters next and warriors
last of all

  we hold here to the death shouted
the inca and from each throat a roar
answered him to the death and
the echos of the word huanacu death
rang and rang through the great stone
chambers with an awful message of
doom tiahuanacu the place of the
dead and huanacu that day were well-
mated words for death was everywhere
sprawled and bleeding crushed heads
and gashed limbs lay before the great
ten doors in heaps four deep were
scattered singly and in groups every-
where across the great chambers
through which they had fought to the
gaping opening which was the escape-
way of the masked one and which he
would never enter again except over
their dead bodies

  that cheers echoing huanacu
reached even to the ears of the ap-
proaching inca army and was taken
up by ten thousand throats as they
broke into double time and came into
the great city of the dead on the loping
incan ground-eating run

  huanacu huanacu rang and rang


mammoth adventure

in the struggling manabi ranks like the
knell of doom like the cry of the death
bird come for their spirits like the
creak of the gates of haek-pachac
opening to admit their evil souls to
hell-and nearer and nearer came the
cry as the armies from cuzco deployed
to surround the temple of the past
the tunca puncu was to be their
huanacu pampa of ten doors
shouted the foremost ranks of the incan
soldiery as they cut down the rear-most
of the manabi still struggling to force
themselves into the already jammed
mass of men within the tunca puncu

  about the turning stone a ring of
dead had fallen and lay bleeding and
over their bodies they fought on the
raging axe of the masked one rising
and falling as though he were in truth
the lord of the realm of death and
the smaller manabi maquahitls flick-
ered and flickered in short quick blows
parried by the longer harder striking
incan weapons though their line of
living was now pitifully thin and closing
steadily nearer and nearer to the gaping
hole that meant freedom for the masked
one and which they had pledged to
die before he reached as each man
fell their ring tightened and shoulder-
to-shoulder they faced the swarming
maddened manabi hampered by their
own numbers and the jamming fright-
to-escape which crushed them ever
against the laboring weapons that slew
and slew as they were pushed close it
was a sickening butchery and one they
deserved but huaycar somehow pitied
these earnest bowlegged hardfighting
manabi-misled by their frightful
masked one into this impasse from
which they would not escape

ttsing the same tactic the masked
one had used the massed shields
of the freh inca soldiery crushed in-
ward through the great central door

their fresh cries of for the inca and
huanacu striking a terrible terror
into the manabi who now saw their de-
feat was inevitable and began to pour
from out the other nine doors in a
steady stream only to be cut down by
the longer-legged incan soldiers who
quickly overtook them and covered the
plaza of the tunca puncu with more
dead here and there a fleeing manabi
could be seen clambering the far slopes
of the hanca pira hill with a tall
quichua hard after and his far land
across the andes obviously a false hope
which he would never reach

  inside the now despairing manabi
flung themselves upon the weapons of
the incan warriors suicidally and swift-
ly the horde of the manabi became a
thousand and then but a hundred men
remained the best armored better-
weaponed nobles who made up the inner
circle of the masked ones council
these ringed him in defense it was his
last stand and theirs and they meant to
make their deaths count but were not
to be given the chance the incan of-
ficers brought fowling nets and cast
over them in sixes and sevens pulling
them to the floor and bount them at
the last the golden-masked and hairy-
limbed monstrosity stood alone his
great axe bursting the nets flung upon
him his huge legs still free-his mask
turning oddly as he watched for the
next attack the eyeholes emitting that
red glow of rage that was so mystifying
and awe inspiring

  kapac tupa called off his men and
they retreated from the great cornered
beast that had been king-and toward
him stalked the inca his golden mace
aswing in his right hand and this time
in his left hand a heavy hardwood
maquahitl which he figured better suited
to parry and block the double-weaponed
attack than the too easily shattered
standard shield
the tunca puncu nugget

  it is more than he deserves-why
let him have the opportunity called
huaycar to the inca but the inca
only growled back his usually gentle
and almost scholarly face after all this
blood and struggle and death a streaked
and furious mask of war-fury let
me have my fun you ninny and
huaycar shut his mouth

  the combat interrupted in their
flight from the kalasasaya continued
where it had left off both men now
equally wearied both wounded more
than once and both filled with a rage
that would be satisfied only with death

 the golden mask lifted and
seemed to light with some flicker of
hope of revenge the huge limbs
tightened their ropy muscles the great
axe swung whirled up-and the
masked one leaped upon the inca as
leaps the hunting spider on its prey

  kapac tupa caught the axe haft on
the heavy maquahuitl shoved it aside to
whistle past his shoulder strike a foun-
tain of sparks as the long arc of the
blade touched the stones of the floor
his counter blow was only partly par-
ried put a great dent in the golden
helmet-and the masks maquahuitl
flashed in a black whirling counter
waist high

  square on the massive head of his
mace the inca caught the blow the
maquahuitl spun from the masks grasp
and flew thirty feet into the air falling
into the great niche where the red-eyed
and awesome state of the creator-of-
all squatted staring unmoved down at
the mad interlopers who cluttered up
his peaceful gloom with their mad rage
for death

  fair the inca tossed aside his
own maquahuitl and faced the mask
with his mace against the great two
bladed war axe the gold champi
against the massive bronze with all its
weight and heft



jphey went at it hammer and parry
duck and swing-a vicious expert
performance of the ancient art of blood-
letting a demonstration fully worthy
of the many courageous veteran eyes
awatch

  both bled now from arm wounds
where they had failed to catch the
full stroke of a blow on haft or head
both gasped for breath and the blur-
ring arcing blows slowed became
shorter more carefully directed at-
temps to kill

  the mask was fighting only to kill
the inca and had no hope on earth of
any other thing did he win or lose but
death the inca was fighting for god
knows what intricate self-made code of
honor-to give this opponent his full
chance with the gods who rule the
earth perhaps was fighting to vent in
full his rage at the plot against him by
this man he hardly knew in any way
and who knew him only by hearsay

  the great figure of the mask was
weary but the power in his strokes was
still crushing and the incas knees bent
as he caught those fearful strokes on
his mace handle holding it long be-
tween his two hands to protect his
head to release with the left swing
in counter stroke the massive figure
ducking smoothly and countering
stroke and stroke sparks flew in show-
ers as the blades met and the dull
thud of the haft on head of mace came
steady and rhythmic they were
strangely almost evenly matched the
incas quick flow of strength evened by
the slower but stronger as skillful han-
dling of the heavy weapon of the mas-
sive mask

then as the mask struck a two-
handed blow down upon the incas
shining helmet kapac tupa stepped
wide and the axe showered bits of rock
from the stone floor-and the inca
threw caution aside and leaped in close


mammoth adventure

to those terrible arms and crashed the
mace full into the grimming mask
crushing the whole horrible sculptured
metal face the stubby giant staggered
back tugging to get the mask free from
his shattered face and blinded eyes and
the inca followed with a wood-splitting
full-arcing blow upon the now defense-
less head the sharp leading edge of
the heavy head of the champi pierced
full through the broad metal headgear
and the giant toppled fell sprawling
twitched and reached with his great
hairy hands moved his wide feet jerk-
ily-and lay still at last in death his
blood formed a slowly widening pool
around the bright ruin of his weird
head-gear the silence after the battle

could have been cut with a knife

  the inca broke this awkward silence

  i always wondered what the freak
really looked like he moved wearily
to the shattered globe that was the
masks fallen head tugged to get the
helmet off the mask came off with
little trouble and the great figure rolled
over the hairy face the thick red
lips the crushed bloody ruin of nose
and eyes and forehead were all there
were to see

  he was but a man like ourselves is
evident not any supernatural horror
from the abyss below just a man and
not too clever either to fling himself
against the might of the inca empire
with but ten thousand men

female bluebeard
by pete bogg

let those who look longingly through the
pages of the matrimonial journals beware
 there is a tale told and substantiated
about a female bluebeard-a woman of mys-
terious powers and a peculiar attractiveness who
lured and then disposed of an unknown number
of unsuspecting men with the aid of such pub-
lications

  someone should have tried warning her pros-
pective husbands and victims but there was no
one capable of undertaking that duty-at first
for the people of laporte indiana were only
mildly curious about their new neighbor the
widow sorenson the farm she purchased lay
less than a mile out of town and consisted of a
full forty-eight acres they heard rumors that
she was well-fixed financially with eight thou-
sand dollars in life insurance and a few thousand
more received from the sale of her home in illi-
nois

  the portly widow arrived with her two chil-
dren and jennie olson in the summer of 
and amazed the truckers with her ability to
juggle heavy boxes and crates the widow soren-
son was no petite creature and from all outward
appearances far from delicate she was five feet
seven inches tall and weighed two hundred
pounds most of which was pure brawn

  it was not long before the community learned
hat this woman wanted to be left alone-and
was capable of taking care of herself an ex-
perienced farmer she could pitch hay milk cows
and do her own butchering of hogs and calves
meat from the soienson farm was sold in la-
porte

  hardly more than a year elapsed when a
strange set of events began to occur in april
of  she married peter gunness a stranger to
the community all might have been well had
the groom not come to an untimely end after
only seven months of wedded bliss mr gunness
left this world for the next the death blow was
dealt by a sausage grinder that accidentally fell
from a shelf mrs gunness explained to the
coroner but the widow was well provided for
with a four thousand dollar policy and the peo-
ple of la porte ceased to think about the matter

  the widow now known as belle gunness con-
tinued to live modestly despite this new wealth
a son was born to her in  a hired man was
engaged to look after her place but she herself
was still active in the butchering of pigs and the
caring of the garden the farm help changed
from time to time but none of the men exerted
any deep influence over belles life a photograph
of her at this time shows a squat powerfully built
woman with an exceedingly dull face

  although it was not known until later-belle
gunness made frequent use of matrimonial jour-
nals she advertised in them regularly listing
her desire for a good husband she was not too
coy regarding her own personality and qualifica-
tions what belle wanted it seemed was a man
of scandinavian birth preferably norwegian who
was kind and honest and who would help a lov-
able and hard-working widow to lift the mort-
gage on her little farm triflers belles ad-
vertisement said coldly need not apply

	by leslie anderson	

the teeth which we brush so diligently
every day have so captured the imagina-
tion of men down through the ages that
literally thousands of legends and curious super-
stitions have sprung up concerning them the
power of the teeth to bring pain and anguish
as well as to determine beauty and ugliness has
focussed the attention on this part of the human
anatomy to a much greater degree than that
accorded the rest of the body

  in the year  a professor residing in
paris seriously taught that the characteristic per-
sonality of a man could be found out by studying
his teeth he tried to prove that teeth perfectly
in alinement were a sign of orderliness and mag-
nanimity in the person under observation teeth
which slanted toward the lips pointed to a passion
for imitation and mockery those whose teeth
bent inward toward the palate possessed the in-
stinct and the impulse to do wrong the pro-
fessors list of characteristics was long and
detailed but men of science have never taken his
statements seriously enough to accord him recog-
nition this study of the teeth belongs in the
same category as the reading of ones fortune in
the wrinkles of the palm and the bumps on the
head

	 

  the early romans thought that an infant born
with a tooth was so remarkable that he should
have a surname commemorating the oddity the
famous consul manius curius  bc owed
his surname dentatus to the fact that several
of his deciduous teeth had come through before
he was born

  on the other hand the country people of hun-
gary are very suspicious of babies born with teeth
they believe these offspring to be changelings
who shortly after their birth were exchanged by
witches for the real children stolen by them and
as a result are treated with general contempt

  much worse is the fate of such children in
certain negro tribes in africa among the basutos
the women assisting at childbirth mercilessly kill
each baby born with teeth or any other de-
formity by drowning it in a pot of water

	 

  at any time as far back as the history of
mankind can be traced at any epoch of civiliza-
tion and at any place where men live very
definite rules were and are observed reearding
the disposal of the childrens baby teeth after
they have dropped out although the traditional
prescription varies slightly from one national
group to another the basic act is this when a
milk tooth falls out the child is supposed to throw
it away over his shoulder backward or over a
roof or into a mousehole and ask a mouse or a
rat or a squirrel or a fox or some other animal

to take the tooth and give the child a better one
in its place

  

  the ancients prized white healthy teeth as
much as we do today but adequate cleaning
methods were unknown to many of them reg-
ular dental hygiene was not practiced in greece
until the country was made a roman province
under the influence of their western neighbor
the grecians learned how to use pumice talcum
emery granulated alabaster stone and coral
powder for dentifrices iron rust too was
recommended

  the romans themselves were not too particular
what they ground into powder to use for teeth-
cleaning purposes bones hoofs and horns of
certain animals crabs egg shells and oyster shells
were pulverized by them after first being burnt
and then mixed with honey

  

  plant remedies as well as those obtained from
animals were popular before the development of
scientific dentistry garlic was one of the most
popular remedies the ancient greeks considered
a decoction of garlic together with aromatic resin-
ous pine yood and incense helpful if kept in the
mouth

	 

  the most renowned example of honor accorded
to a tooth is found in the history of the celebrated
tooth of buddha tracing the worship of this
relic a strange and fantastic history is unearthed

  in the temple of kandy india there is assumed
to exist among other treasures of untold value
that most sacred and precious piece the tooth of
buddha which is esteemed with devotion by four
hundred and fifty millions of people it is said
to be one of the four canine teeth of gautama
which were among his seven great relics and has
been famous in ceylonese buddhism as the dalada
its miraculous preservation from every means
taken to destroy it by a hostile indian king and
its ultimate arrival in ceylon in the year of 
reads like an exciting adventure story the chinese
traveler fa-hian describes the procession of the
relic as he saw it in  in the thirteenth century
dhammakitti wrote a pali poem about it based
on an older singhalese work in prose named
datha vamsa once it was sold for many
millions to the king of burma at a later time
the portuguese are believed to have crushed it
into fragments and thrown it into the ocean yet
the ceylonese preserved it at kandy in a shrine
in its original form and size the size of a hippo-
potamus tooth it must be remembered that this
tooth was not taken from a common mortal mans
mouth but from the mouth of that worshiped
superman buddha

the cab purred off into the eve-
ning darkness leaving gregg
stacey alone on the curb he
wasted no-time lingering there a street
lamp several feet away enclosed him
within its circle of illumination made
his figure too conspicuous he wasnt
certain yet that he hadnt been fol-
lowed

  bending quickly he gathered up his
bags and strode across a stretch of lawn
to the sidewalk a short distance away
he sighted a broad shadowed opening
between two buildings flanked by tall
bushes it was the entrance to a drive-
way he turned into it stopping where
the shadows were thickest he couldnt
be seen from the street now

  he set down his bags again and
pulled out his pipe he began filling
it from an oilskin pouch watching the

street unable to shake off a feeling of
unease that lay like a black cold shad-
ow on his mind

  cars passed frequently on the street
they went rapidly going somewhere
not slowly as though looking for
something there were occasional pe-
destrians but they came and went with
a definiteness that carried no hint that
they might be searching

  finally carefully gregg stacey
lighted his pipe the match flickering
in his large brown hand illumined his
face it was a youthful face broad
with a pleasantly wide mouth and thick
dark brows that almost met over the
bridge of a short blunt nose the eyes
narrowed intently over the pipe were
a clear candid blue fringed heavily with
dark lashes they were quick straight
intelligent eyes that many people would

        men fought and died in search of the
alaskan bonanza while only two people held
the key-a split map that had to be matched




mammoth adventure

find disconcerting an easy humor
showed in the lines around his mouth
and eyes but they were deepened now
by grimness and strain he wore a
belted tan gabardine trench coat over a
gray tweed suit and a brown felt hat
the brim of which had been pulled low
over his forehead

  the pipe going satisfactorily stacey
resumed his watch of the street he
thought of the girl named norma red-
dick and impatience began to build up
within him norma reddick held the
answer to the mystery that had brought
stacey to seattle she lived just around
the corner in the next block if the cab
driver who had brought stacey here
knew his directions stacey had given
an address near the girls in case he
might be followed he hadnt wanted
to lead pursuit directly to her even
though he had changed cabs twice since
leaving the airport

    unknown to stacey he had seen
her several times the last being some
ten years ago when both were little
more than kids these meetings had
taken place on the infrequent occasions
when their respective fathers ben sta-
cey and warren reddick came down
from alaska to visit them the two
men were inseparable friends and as
partners operated a couple of mines
near fairbanks

  stacey remembered norma as an im-
pudent skinny brat with hair of an
indefinite blonde shade and a disdain-
ful snub nose sprinkled generously with
freckles he hadnt liked her and he
doubted that he would like her now
he reminded himself that his only rea-
son for coming to see her at all was
because she knew the explanation be-
hind the half of a map which he had
received a few days before it had
been sent by chinook vervain a half-

breed servant of his father and warren
reddick with the map fragment ver-
vain had enclosed a badly scrawled
barely legible note containing normas
address and informing stacey that the
girl had the other half of the map and
would explain the matter vervain had
added a strange warning for stacey to
be careful

  as it developed the warning hadnt
been an empty one the next day stacey
received a visit from two men obvious
toughs who had offered to buy his half
of the map he had refused to sell
that evening while stacey had been
out making arrangements for his trip to
seattle his room had been painstaking-
ly searched the map half hadnt been
found for the simple reason that stacey
had taken it with him

  the two men had followed stacey
afterward their purpose now evidently
one of robbing him of the map but
doubly warned stacey had managed to
elude them so far anyway he thought
it was possible that the sinister duo had
followed in another plane landing but
scant minutes behind him and even
now might be hot on his trail with a
lead furnished by a swift check-up of
cab drivers

  heavy dark brows meeting in a
frown of perplexity stacey puffed at his
pipe and watched the street for the
dozenth time he wondered what the
split map could mean to what did it
lead apparently to something valuable
enough to have brought his two hard-
faced visitors all the way from alaska
in the effort to buy or steal it who were
these men who was behind them
and above all stacey wanted to know
why chinook vervain instead of his
father or warren reddick had written
to him the fact that the map had been
divided showed the two partners had
expected trouble of some kind in con-
nection with it did their silence indi-
quest of the split map



cate that something had happened to
them

  the pipe went out between staceys
teeth he knocked it empty on the
heel of his hand decision crystallizing
in his mind he was going to see norma
reddick hed waited long enough to
be sure that he hadnt been followed

  tucking away the pipe stacey picked
up his bags and left the driveway it
was only a short distance to the corner
a sign there assured him that the in-
tersecting street was the one he wanted
he turned into it striding rapidly
watching the house numbers he hadnt
entirely abandoned his sense of caution
he scrutinized closely the people who
went by and the cars that drove past
but still he saw nothing that hinted
of danger

kjorma reddicks address
proved to be that of a tall apart-
ment hotel walking toward the en-
trance stacey heard a car door slam
behind him the noise was followed
by the sound of swiftly approaching
feet stacey whirled thoughts flashing
in alarm

  two men were coming toward him
he relaxed a little as he saw they were
not the men who had visited him in los
angeles but there was a purposeful-
ness about them that showed stacey
was their immediate objective

  stacey measured them grimly he
hadnt heard a car drive up the two
must have been waiting for him all the
time he discarded the idea of bolting
into the building as soon as it came he
wouldnt have been able to make it

  youre gregg stacey arent you
one of the men asked in a politely in-
quiring tone he was fully as tall as
stacey though somewhat slimmer with
sharp olive features that narrowly es-
caped being handsome even white
teeth showed in a smile below a thin

carefully trimmed black mustache he
was smartly and even foppishly dressed
his black homburg was tilted a bit too
rakishly and his gray double-breasted
topcoat fitted a bit too snugly at the
hips

  his companion was of an entirely dif-
ferent type the man was a giant h
had a square lumpy face and heavy
sloping shoulders from which swung
arms that seemed abnormally long his
clothes were several sizes too small for
him not to mention the fact that a
borneo bushman might have shown
more taste in their color scheme

  stacey forced a smile to his lips and
shook his head the names johnson
you probably have me confused with
someone else

  im more than positive i havent
the man in the black homburg said
evenly you look too much like ben
stacey for there to be any mistake
stacey said nothing he didnt in-
tend to commit himself the fact that
this foppish stranger knew his father
didnt necessarily mean he was a friend

  the others even white teeth gleamed
in a faintly mocking smile your si-
lence i presume is an admission that
youre actually gregg stacey lets
stop beating around the bush you
have part of a certain map mr stacey
i want to buy it

  im afraid i dont know what youre
talking about

  come come mr stacey im sure
we have more important things to do
than play games i happen to know
you have the map

  staceys mildly quizzical expression
vanished then you must be con-
nected with the two men who came to
me in los angeles youre here to get
norma reddicks half of the map and
the los angeles boys contacted you
after i gave them the slip somehow
you knew i was coming to seattle to


mammoth adventure

see the girl

  it pays to be informed mr stacey
the other returned coolly at any
rate im sure this knowledge doesnt
affect my offer to buy your half of the
map

  grimly stacey pointed out those
los angeles boys tried to steal my half
thats no way to do business youve
practically admitted being connected
with them

  allow me to apologize for the boys
then theyre just a bit too impulsive
sometimes the dapper stranger lifted
slim shoulders in a shrug suppose
we return to the subject of the map mr
stacey as i said i want to buy it
name your price

  i havent anything to sell

  is that a refusal

  you might put it that way

phe other thoughtfully fingered his
thin black mustache he said fin-
ally your words suggest that youre in
no position to sell the map mr stacey
-even though you might like to is it
because you dont have the map with
you

  the question rang an alarm bell in-
side stacey it seemed abruptly clear
to him that the strangers talk about
buying the map was merely a subter-
fuge to determine whether or not stacey
had it in his possession the two men
in los angeles had searched his room
after employing the same trick there
was little doubt in his mind about what
the pair before him would do if he were
to admit that he had the map on his
person

  you guessed it stacey said after
that stunt your friends tried to pull in
los angeles i decided id better be
careful so i mailed the map on ahead
since youre interested only in buying
it im sure it wont be necessary for
me to tell you where the information

wouldnt do you any good anyway
since im the only one who can claim
the letter

  clever-but you hesitated just a
bit too long mr stacey the man in
the black homburg smiled thinly and
nodded at his hulking clumsily dressed
companion all right buck

  the giant started forward thick lips
stretching in an eager grin stacey
glanced quickly up and down the street
nobody was in sight for the moment
he would have no help in what was
shortly to take place

  but there was no time to worry over
odds stacey moved into action he
ducked under bucks first swing and
heaved his shoulder violently into the
giants midriff buck staggered back
crashing into his dapper chief

  whirling stacey darted for the en-
trance to the apartment hotel he found
the door handle and pulled nothing
happened the door seemed to be
locked then he saw the small metal
plate fixed to the frame the door was
to be pushed not pulled against but
the information came too late to do
stacey any good before he could cor-
rect his mistake buck reached him
again

  a great hand closed like a trap on
staceys shoulder he felt himself
swung around as easily as though he
were a child an enormous fist leaped
out exploding against his chin all the
lights went out

ctacey regained consciousness to
find himself on a wheeltable in a
small white-painted room that smelled
strongly of disinfectant pain beat a
wild anvil chorus inside his skull

  after a while he sat up the effort
sent waves of white hot agony through
him he groaned raising his hands
to his temples he discovered that his
head had been bandaged another dis-
quest of the split map



covery came a moment later his
clothes had been soaked with whiskey
traces of it still lingered in his mouth

  awake eh a voice asked cheer-
fully

  stacey turned a short slender man
in white trousers and tunic had entered
the room an interne stacey decided
he said

  this is a hospital

  the interne nodded a motorist
found you draped over the tracks at a
railroad crossing and brought you in
you were lucky mister a train was
due in another ten minutes and you
were out cold probably stumbled and
hit your head on the tracks he
grinned that must have been some
party

  stacey opened his mouth then closed
it to explain what had actually hap-
pened to him would accomplish nothing
useful going over the events which
had lead to his awakening in the hos-
pital he thought suddenly of the map
anxiety flaming through him he
reached quickly into the inner breast
pocket of his coat

  the map was gone

chapter ii

hphis time stacey pushed the door
swung smoothly open and he strode
into the lobby of the apartment hotel
where norma reddick lived

  there had been no difficulty about
leaving the hospital the interne had
obligingly called a cab and after tidying
himself up as best he could in a wash-
room stacey had left luckily enough
the contents of his billfold had been left
intact the map had been the only
thing taken from him his luggage
amazingly had not been lost

  to the left of the lobby opposite a
self-service elevator was a small office
a woman night clerk set at a telephone

switchboard reading a magazine she
glanced up sharply as stacey appeared
her bespectacled eyes widened at sight
of his bruised face and bandaged head

  id like to see norma reddick
stacey requested he gave his name

  the woman glanced disapprovingly
at a clock on an adjacent wall before
she turned to the switchboard it was
almost midnight stacey saw hardly the
time to be calling on anyone-a young
lady least of all

  the woman clerks ring was answered
quickly enough she spoke into the
mouthpiece a moment then turned back
to stacey

  you may go up the room number
is 

  staceys thoughts were grim as he
ascended in the elevator it had been
ten years since he had last seen norma
reddick she was very much an un-
known quantity he couldnt be en-
tirely certain that she wasnt connected
with the two men who earlier in the
evening had waylaid him and robbed
him of his half of the map

  stacey already knew that the map led
to something valuable enough to make
robbery and attempted murder worth-
while he didnt know exactly what it
was but norma reddick apparently
did if she were able to explain every-
thing to him as chinook vervain had
written the girl might have decided
to get staceys half vervain might
have given her staceys los angeles
address as stacey had been given hers
in seattle thus the girl could very
well be the person behind the los an-
geles attempt and when that failed
she could have prepared the trap at this
end knowing through vervain again
that stacey was coming to seattle to
see her

  it explained very nicely the knowl-
edge of the map and of staceys where-
abouts possessed by the man in the


mammoth adventure

black homburg and his companions
stacey couldnt see how else the others
fitted into the picture and knew as much
as they did

jphe elevator stopped stacey
emerged with his bags into a long
hall locating room  he knocked
the door opened after a moment re-
vealing a girl

  despite himself stacey stared he
had seen lovely women before but he
hadnt expected norma reddick to fall
into that category for some inex-
plicable reason he felt suddenly awk-
ward and foolish

  the girl surveyed him cooly from
large long-lashed brown eyes their
expression didnt quite match the tense
set of her piquant oval features she
wore a maroon satin robe about her
slender figure and her small feet had
been thrust into furry white mules
blonde hair the color of ripe wheat was
piled in thick coils atop her head her
skin was delicately tanned and the
freckles stacey remembered lay like the
faintest of bronze shadows over her
cheeks and the bridge of her small
nose she had been preparing for bed
stacey decided or had already been
asleep when he arrived

  finally norma reddick stood aside
wont you come in her voice was
soft and cool like her eyes

  the living room stacey entered was
small simply but comfortably and
tastefully furnished it showed none of
the usual frills of feminine occupancy
stacey sat down stiffly not quite sure of
himself as the girl closed the door and
nodded at the sofa

  she leaned against the wall near the
door and looked at him hands buried
in the pockets of her robe the ten-
sion which stacey had earlier noted had
deepened in her face and now wariness
was apparent too her eyes moved

over his clothes and then from his
bruised jaw to his bandaged head sta-
cey was abruptly painfully conscious
of the whiskey odor that still hung
about him the girl said

  you claim to be gregg stacey its
quite possible that youre trying to trick
me the last time i saw gregg stacey
was ten years ago-and in ten years
people can change so much that it isnt
too hard for other people to impersonate
them she paused a moment as though
to note the effect of her words if
youre actually gregg stacey suppose
you prove it

  suppose you tell me how stacey
said you started the game

  well    you might have half of
a certain map for one thing

  youve got me there stacey indi-
cated his bandaged head and explained
what had happened beginning with his
receipt of the map half from chinook
vervain and ending with its loss in the
encounter with the man in the black
homburg and his giant companion
buck

norma reddick moved her slim
shoulders indifferently an interesting
story it could be just a little too pat
stacey felt a surge of anger you
dont believe me

  why should i you still havent
proved anything one way or another
neither have you for that matter
stacey pointed out grimly theres
no reason why you should be considered
entirely above suspicion i dont know
what the whole map leads to-some-
thing valuable evidently-but you do
you could have decided to steal my
half chinook vervain probably gave
you my address just as he gave me
yours so you could be the person be-
hind the two men who searched my
room in los angeles and when that
failed you could have had the other
two waiting for me outside knowing i
quest of the split map



was coming here to see you

  but i didnt have anything to do
with it norma reddick insisted with
a trace of indignation why mark
devore-the one in the black hat-is
after my half of the map too 

  too pat stacey said doesnt
prove anything one way or another

jphe girls face tightened angrily but
in another moment she grinned
some of my own medicine is that it
all right lets settle this once and for
all if youre actually gregg stacey
tell me what happened in the movie our
fathers took us to the last time we saw
each other

  stacey scowled you put a wad of
chewing gum on my seat and i sat on
it i was wearing my best pair of
pants too

  you sound as though you were still
mad norma reddick said she tried
to look serious though her brown eyes
showed a betraying twinkle if its
not too late to apologize id like to
do so

  stacey watched her unsmilingly from
beneath the overhang of his heavy
brows you may be satisfied about
me but im afraid i cant say the same
for you you havent proved that you
arent the person behind the men who
stole my half of the map

  red lips tightening the girl reached
into the neck of her robe and pulled out
an envelope she tossed it into sta-
ceys lap

  the envelope contained half of a
map-the girls half stacey discovered
he looked up at her puzzled she said
if you think i had anything to do
with the theft of your part of the map
then heres mine to make up for it i
dont know any other way of proving
my innocence

  stacey handed the envelope back
hastily i wouldnt think of doing any-

thing like that anyway your part
wouldnt be any good without mine io
go with it

  norma reddick thoughtfully re-
stored the envelope to its hiding place
you took that last hurdle nicely so
i guess i wont be needing this she
pulled a small revolver from a pocket of
her robe and placed it on a bookcase
near the door

  stacey wras staring in dismay you
mean if i hadnt given you back the
envelope    

  something like that the girl took
in staceys expression and grinned

  stacey sputtered wrathfully but in
another moment meeting the dancing
impishness in norma reddicks brown
eyes he grinned too

  the girl went to a nearby chair and
sat down stacey produced his pipe
and began to fill it frowning medi-
tatively he said

  but the fellow in the black hat-the
one you called mark devore how
does he figure in this if hes an out-
sider how does he happen to know so
much about everything that has hap-
pened here

  adding what youve told me to what
i already know it seems easy to guess
norma answered mark devore came
to me two days ago and explained that
he was a friend of my father he said
he had flown here from grubstake the
tiny mining town near fairbanks where
my father    and yours-her voice
faltered strangely-operated their
mines devore told me father was be-
ing held prisoner by a gang and unless
i gave my half of the map as ransom
father would be killed devore even
had a note from father verifying his
story father wrote he was being held
prisoner and that i was to give my half
of the map to devore a friend who had
been chosen by the gang to act as go-
between


mammoth adventure

jevore lied stacey growled

     after what happened to me a
while ago its clear that devore wasnt
acting as go-between for anybody but
devore hes most likely the leader of
this gang and forced your father to
write the note

  i didnt suspect anything like that
at the time norma went on but i
decided to stall him off until you ar-
rived i realized that my half of the
map was valueless unless your half
went with it i wanted to compare
notes with you to see if any demands
had been made upon you and what
sort

  i knew you were to visit me be-
cause i too received a note from chi-
nook vervain with my half of the map
but enclosed was also a letter from my
father which explained what the affair
was all about the letter had been
written not long previously father was
afraid that something might happen to
him and he arranged with chinook
vervain for the letter to be sent to me
in case anything did chinook also had
the map with orders to send a half to
each of us father took this precaution
since he suspected without actually
knowing who they were at the time
that unscrupulous men were after the
map-men who would stop at nothing
to get it

  stacey emitted a cloud of pipe smoke
and leaned forward theres one
thing i dont understand where was
my father while all this was going on
norma hesitated glancing away
youll have to prepare yourself for a
shock gregg

  why    what do you mean
  your father is dead

  stacey rose slowly from the sofa

    murdered

  no gregg he was sick norma
paused a moment as though groping for
continuity perhaps id better ex-

plain everything in order

  stacey nodded mechanically he
stared at the floor not seeing anything
the lines in his face had deepened

  norma resumed i learned about
ben staceys death in my fathers let-
ter its tied in with the explanation
for the map you see several years ago
an old prospector came into grubstake
with the story that he had discovered a
fabulously rich vein of gold which he
called the golden dream the pros-
pector drank himself to death in a wild
orgy of celebration before he got around
to doing so much as filing a claim but
he was only person who knew the gol-
den dreams location and the secret
died with him hundreds of men later
searched for the vein but none ever
found it-that is until ben stacey did

  he and my father had a theory
about the location of the vein and
planned to set out together on a pros-
pecting trip but a few days before
they were to start my father had an ac-
cident at one of the mines and broke his
ankle ben stacey and chinook set out
alone they found the vein all right
and ben stacey made a map of the lo-
cation then as he and chinook were
on their way back ben stacey took
sick by the time chinook got him to
the hospital in grubstake it was too
late to do anything

  before he died however ben stacey
was delirious and revealed not only that
he had rediscovered the golden dream
but had drawn a map leading to it the
news spread father had the map by
this time and decided to take the pre-
cautions ive already mentioned he
ordered chinook to go into hiding
since chinook had been with ben sta-
cey and could have been forced to tell
where the vein was chinook thus had
the letter and the map and was free
to send them on to us in the event that
something happened to father
quest of the split map



  why didnt your father file a
claim stacey demanded he would
have been safe then

  things evidently happened too
fast norma said fathers ankle
hadnt entirely healed yet and he didnt
have time to do even so much as wire
you about ben staceys death if it
hadnt been for his ankle he could have
gone into hiding with chinook any-
way no information could have been
forced from him since without the
map he didnt know where the golden
dream was located

ctacey nodded thoughtfully as
regards devore its clear enough
how he got his information he was
one of a number of people who heard
the news about the golden dream and
the map that dad gave out while delir-
ious we already know devore must
be the leader of the gang that is holding
your father prisoner devore appar-
ently forced your father to tell what
happened to the map learning it had
been sent to us then devore got our
addresses either from your father or
from old letters which we had written
stacey puffed in silence a moment
how long did you succeed in keeping
devore stalled off

  im supposed to give him my deci-
sion about the map in the morning
norma answered

  id been hoping for more time than
that stacey said in dismay the
only way to beat devore is to file a
claim to the golden dream thats
impossible without my half of the map
but devore probably thinks a train fin-
ished me by now and with enough time
i could have flown to grubstake to find
chinook he knows the location of the
vein and friends of his would have told
me where he was hiding then i could
have tried to find your father hes
most likely being held prisoner some-

where near grubstake

  norma said slowly i could try to
stall devore off a while longer the
drawback is that he now has your half
of the map and would refuse to wait i
couldnt do anything that would en-
danger my fathers life

  stacey stared morosely into space
gnawing at the stem of his pipe the
situation was hopeless if only he
hadnt lost his portion of the map-
abruptly stacey slapped his knee face
brightening

  ive got it he told norma lis-
ten devore wants your map half
theres no way we can stall him off
without risking the chance that your
father will be killed all right well
give him what he wants-but not ex-
actly devore doesnt know what your
half of the map looks like we could
give him a faked map-a map showing
a false location for the golden dream-
and hed never know the difference
and thats just what well do itll put
your father out of danger for the time
being and before devore finds out hes
been tricked ill have found chinook
and filed a claim

  norma was smiling eagerly but in
another moment she sobered the
faked map will have to pass a close in-
spection devore is certain to compare
it with your half

  well get around that stacey said
with assurance well use paper and
ink as nearly like that of the original as
can possibly be found and well see
that its properly aged by soiling and
creasing

  norma snapped her fingers theres
an all-night drugstore down the street
it has a large stationery department
but if we cant find exactly what we
want the manager will get it for us
or for me rather norma grinned
wryly just one of my many admirers
well get started at once stacey


mammoth adventure

said when were finished with the
map ill check in at a hotel and get
some sleep in the morning ill take a
plane to juneau from there ill be
able to get another to take me to grub-
stake

  you dont seem to be including me
in your plans norma pointed out
youd better-b e c a u s e im going
along

  stacey objected pointing out the
dangers that lay ahead but the girl
remained adamant finally stacey gave
in somehow it wasnt hard to do

chapter iii

tvcorning sunlight was warm on
staceys face as he stood watch-
ing the entrance to norma reddicks
apartment hotel from a deeply recessed
doorway on the same side of the street
but a safe distance away he puffed
impatiently at his pipe and wondered
how much longer it would be before de-
vore and buck came out almost fif-
teen minutes had passed since the two
had gone into the building

  staceys thoughts became worried
could something have gone wrong
had devore discovered at the very out-
set that normas map half had been
faked

  the possibility was one that stacey
couldnt avoid despite the fact that he
and norma had been able to secure
materials closely similar to those used in
the original map and that stacey had
worked into the small hours of the
morning over the imitation it had
taken longer than stacey had expected
there had been no time for sleep after-
ward stacey had checked in at a hotel
but only long enough to take a cold
shower and change his clothes then
hed had breakfast and made air reser-
vations to juneau restlessness and a
nagging anxiety had made him decide to

be present near normas apartment
hotel when devore arrived with buck
to get normas map half he had been
watching since the two appeared and
entered the building

  while waiting stacey had toyed with
the idea of calling the police to arrest
devore and buck and even of jumping
the two alone when they emerged he
had realized however that he could do
nothing while devore held warren red-
dick in his power to take any sort of
action against devore at this point
would only doom normas father be-
sides stacey saw his big advantage lay
in keeping himself out of the picture
for the time being as long as de-
vore thought him out of the way he
would be able to wage a campaign that
would take devore by surprise right on
his home grounds without running the
risk that innocent persons would suffer

  peering from his doorway vantage
point stacey stiffened- as he saw two
men leave the apartment hotel there
was no mistaking the pair devore and
buck

  they seemed highly elated stacey
heard devore laugh then the two
crossed the sidewalk and entered a car
parked at the curb the machine looked
like one rented from a drive-yourself
agency

  the car pulled away from the curb
and sped off in the opposite direction
stacey watched it dwindle in the dis-
tance and finally disappear into an in-
tersecting street he felt certain that
devore wouldnt return leaving the
doorway he strode toward the apart-
ment hotel

orma was busy packing when sta-
cey arrived she grinned excitedly

  it worked like a charm she re-
ported devore swallowed that fake
map hook line and sinker he didnt
examine it very closely evidently sure
quest of the split map

a

that id be too afraid to trick him

  i was starting to get worried sta-
cey admitted he was up here so long
that i thought hed found out what we
were up to

  norma made a face devore was
giving me a song and dance about how
worried he was over father and how
sorry he felt that the gang in alaska
should force me to give up the map this
way he insisted that he was fathers
friend and that nothing was too good
for the daughter of a friend of his he
was so concerned about my future that
he offered me a job

  a job stacey snorted doing
what cracking safes and cutting
throats

   private secretary it seems devore
operates a few mines around gurbstake
himself he named a salary too large
for honorable intentions and every time
i refused he raised it finally though
he accepted the idea that i wasnt in-
terested in working for him at any
price and left

  stacey was thoughtful if devore
was sincere about the job that means
your father doesnt know devore is
responsible for his being kept prisoner
thus when your father is released de-
vore will be in the clear he can file
a claim to the golden dream and no-
body can prove anything without the
map neither we nor your father could
tell if it was the golden dream or any
one of a dozen still undiscovered veins
of gold

  norma resumed packing while sta-
cey used the phone to send for a cab
when the girl had finished and readied
herself for leaving they talked while
waiting for the cab to arrive typical
small-talk that did much to relieve the
nerve-gnawing tension which both felt

  stacey learned that norma had been
working as a fashion designer for a
large exclusive seattle dress shop al-

most shyly she revealed her plans for
opening a small shop of her own to
sell clothes which she had designed
finding the conversational gambit in
his hands at one point stacey told the
girl that he had been taking a post-
graduate course in chemistry at a uni-
versity in los angeles studies that had
been interrupted by two years of war
duty with a chemical warfare division
in europe

  no time at all seemed to have
elapsed when the clerk downstairs rang
to notify that their cab was waiting
stacey took the girls bags and they
left the room hed already had his
own luggage sent to the airport

  stacey didnt overlook the possibil-
ity that devore and buck obviously on
the way to grubstake also might take
the same plane on which he and norma
had booked passage at the airport
he gave the cab driver a bill with or-
ders to check the passenger list on the
pretext that he was trying to locate a
fare who while enroute to the airport
earlier had left a wallet in his cab
the driver was also to tour the terminal
building looking for devore and buck
on the basis of descriptions which sta-
cey supplied stacey realized that de-
vore and buck might travel under false
names

he cabbie found no trace of the
two however stacey remained cau-
tious nevertheless until the plane bear-
ing norma and himself finally took off
for juneau

  the trip was uneventful yet to
stacey it had all the glamor of a flight
to the moon how much of this mood
was due to normas presence he didnt
dare guess the girl was intelligent
humorous fascinating to talk to he
found that they had an astonishingly
large number of outlooks and ideals in
common


mammoth adventure

  stacey was startled when the stew-
ardess announced that they were short-
ly to land in juneau it seemed im-
possible that the trip could have been
made so soon

  immediately after landing stacey
made inquiries at the air terminal about
the next flight to fairbanks a plane
was due to leave in twenty minutes
stacey was elated it meant that no
time would be lost he made the nec-
essary arrangements for passage and
then after a quick meal in a restaurant
adjoining the terminal he and norma
were once more in the air

  at fairbanks stacey found that a
train on the alaska railroad would take
them to grubstake the train was the
last that day from seward and would
arrive in two hours stacey didnt
mind the wait with norma time had
little if any meaning and he was cer-
tain that he had a more than sufficiently
large lead on devore and buck

  stacey bought tickets and then he
and norma took a seat in the station
they didnt talk much by this time
a depth and warmth of understanding
between them had been reached that
made words superfluous

  norma fell asleep her head resting
against staceys shoulder after a while
he put his arm around her he thought
of his pipe but filling and lighting it
would have required taking his arm
away he decided that the situation
was sufficiently perfect as it was

  the train arrived on time less than
an hour later stacey and norma were
in grubstake

  a dilapidated flivver with the word
taxi crudely painted on its sides was
parked at the depot the driver an
elderly man whose appearance was com-
pletely in keeping with the car took
stacey and norma to grubstakes only
hotel it was after midnight and the
drive showed the town dark and desert-

ed stacey was grimly glad of that
fact his and normas arrival couldnt
have been timed better since it would
draw hardly any notice

  the hotel was a large frame building
covered with asbestos shingles stacey
and norma registered under assumed
names according to a prearranged plan
the clerk took them up a broad stair-
way to the doors of their respective
rooms he was short and bald with
protuberant eyes that showed a strong
curiosity

  stacey and norma parted with a
deliberate casualness that left the clerk
plainly disappointed once in his room
stacey lost no time preparing for bed
hed had little if any sleep the past few
days and had been going along mainly
on reserve energy sleep engulfed him
like a tidal wave as soon as his head
touched the pillow

jhe sound of someone knocking at
his door awakened stacey sun-
light poured into the room from around
the edges of the drawn window shade
he gazed about him uncomprehending-
ly for a moment while the knocking
came again

  who is it he called out

  its me norma do you feel like
getting up

  stacey glanced at his watch it was
almost eleven oclock he answered
id better get up if i feel like it or
not

  ill meet you down in the dining
room then

  be right with you

  stacey washed and dressed quickly
and went downstairs the hotel dining
room was small and pleasantly old-
fashioned he found norma seated at
a corner table he had hardly sat
down when a buxom waitress came to
take his order

  well here we are norma said with
quest of the split map



grim cheerfulness when the waitress
had gone where do we start first
the most important thing to do in
the beginning is to find chinook ver-
vain stacey responded chinook
knows the location of the golden
dream and with his help we can file a
claim devore will be blocked off in
that direction then well try to find
your father chinook knows the lo-
cality around grubstake and may have
an idea about where your father is be-
ing kept

  but how are you going to find chi-
nook norma asked hes supposed
to be in hiding-and he really must be
well hid if devore hadnt been able to
find him

  chinook has friends in grubstake
stacey pointed out the obvious
place to look for them is among the peo-
ple who worked for your father and
mine the stacey-reddick mining
company has an office here in grub-
stake

  norma grinned with characteristic
impishness mastermind then she
sobered gregg it seems almost too
easy suppose something goes wrong
i dont see how anything can go
wrong until devore and buck get here
and we have enough time stacey
put a confidence into his words that he
didnt entirely feel

  norma remained grave stacey made
no further attempts at false light-heart-
edness he saw that the intimate mood
which they had shared the previous day
was not to be recaptured to both
grubstake had become synonymous
with danger and their presence in the
town seemed to cast a shadow over their
thoughts and emotions

  the waitress returned bringing nor-
mas order along with staceys they
ate in silence a short time later they
left the hotel a pedestrian directed
them to the offices of the stacey-red-

dick mining company grubstake was
small and they found that they could
easily walk the distance

  their objective proved to be a small
single-storied brick building of compar-
atively recent construction sight of if
and the sign over the entrance acted a a
catalyst upon them releasing a long-
pent excitement

  stacey caught normas eager gaze
and nodded this is it keep your
fingers crossed

  hey strode inside just within the
entrance was a wooden railing be-
yond which a group of a dozen or so
people sat at work behind desks their
appearance made them the targets of
a concerted barrage of curious stares-
the longest and most intent of which
seemed to be directed at stacey after
a moment a young woman rose from one
of the nearest desks and came forward
can i help you

  id like to see whoever is in charge
here stacey said

  that will be superintendent bill
haekstrom who shall i tell him is
calling

  stacey gave his name the young
womans face showed a look of sur-
prise though the answer didnt seem en-
tirely unexpected she turned quickly
and strode into one of a group of three
offices partitioned off from the rest of
the room almost at once she returned
opening a gate in the railing

  mr haekstrom says he will be de-
lighted to see you

  haekstrom was a red-headed burly
man with broad scandinavian features
he wrung staceys hand with a delight
that was almost tearful

so youre gregg ben staceys boy
id have known it a mile away youre
a regular mirror image of your dad
a regular chip off the old block 
haekstrom greeted norma with simi-


mammoth adventure

lar enthusiasm he bustled about ex-
citedly closing the door and settling
his visitors in chairs finally he sat
down on a corner of his desk and his
broad face turned solemn he said
slowly

  a lot of strange things have hap-
pened here within the last few weeks
maybe you can explain some of them
for me what i want to know most of
all is what happened to warren red-
dick he was laid up with a busted
ankle you know then he suddenly
went away somewhere without letting
me know where he was going or why
just left me a note telling me to take
charge of things until he got back

  warren reddick was kidnapped
stacey said

  haekstrom stared incredulously
but the note he left me i know his
handwriting like i know my own face
he wrote it all right

  warren reddick was undoubtedly
forced to write that note stacey ex-
plained but before i go any further
i want to check on something you
heard about my father finding the
golden dream and the map he made of
its location

  haekstrom nodded his bristling red
shock sure-and so has almost ev-
erybody else in grubstake your dad
was sick you know and talked about
the lode and the map before  be-
fore he died

  stacey went on to tell about receiving
half of the map from chinook vervain
and the attempt which had been made
in los angeles to steal it then he de-
tailed its loss in the encounter with de-
vore and buck in seattle where he had
gone to see norma he outlined de-
vores part in the affair explaining what
had actually happened to reddick and
told of the trick which he and norma
had used to prevent devore from ob-
taining normas map half finally he

related his and normas purpose in
coming to grubstake

  chinook knows the location of the
golden dream and he might know
where warren reddick is being held
stacey told haekstrom i came to you
on the chance that you could tell me
where chinook is hiding out if i can
find chinook devore is through

  haekstrom smiled sadly bitterly a
note from chinook reached me a little
over a week ago he wanted to see me
and told me where he was a cabin up
near birch creek he said i shouldnt
let anybody else know and to be care-
ful well when i got there i found
the cabin burned down investigating
i found bones among the ruins-hardly
more than cinder and ash chinook
vervain is dead

chapter iv

jhe hotel dining room was filled
with the buzz of voices it was eve-
ning and almost all the tables were oc-
cupied

  stacey and norma sat at a table be-
side one of the windows they had just
finished eating norma was gazing
pensively through the window at the
lighted signs and storefronts of grub-
stakes main street heavy brows fused
in a scowl stacey brooded into his
empty coffee cup smoke spiralling from
the pipe gripped between his teeth de-
jection was a weight that lay heavily
over both

  there no longer was any doubt in
staceys mind that chinook vervain
was actually dead at first he had re-
fused to believe haekstroms story he
had trusted the man instinctively from
the very first moment of their meeting
but chinook had been his only hope for
defeating devores ruthless plans and
he had been reluctant to accept the fact
that is should be so swiftly lost that
quest of the split map



afternoon however haekstrom had
taken stacey and nofma to birch
creek and stacey had seen the evi-
dence of the burned cabin with his own

eyes

  knowledge of his helplessness ate at
staceys mind like an acid there
seemed utterly nothing that he could
do now nowhere that he could turn

  stacey was startled as he felt nor-
mas fingers grip abruptly at his wrist
the girl was peering tensely through
the window following the direction
of her eyes stacey saw two men passing
a lighted store-front on the opposite side
of the street he recognized them at
once devore and buck

  the two carried suitcases and were
striding along swiftly and purposefully
they had obviously just returned to
grubstake

  a cold emptiness spreading through
him stacey met normas gaze the
girls features were drawn with despair
she whispered

  gregg what are we going to do if
devore finds out that were here my
father will be killed father is all the
evidence we have against devore and
devore wont take the chance that we
might get to him

  well have to take the fight directly
to devore stacey answered grimly
were here and we certainly wouldnt
accomplish anything by hiding out like
a couple of mice if we act fast enough
devore wont have time to do anything
about your father staceys face
tightened with sudden decision and
i know just how to start im going to
follow devore 

  but gregg if something happens
to you-

  thats the risk ill have to take
stacey rose tossing a bill to the table
you go to your room norma and stay
there until i get back heedless of
the girls protests he grabbed his hat

and hurried out to the street

tevore and buck were still in
sight keeping to the side of the
street opposite that along which the pair
were striding stacey followed rapidly
in their wake

  the pursuit led for two blocks along
grubstakes main thoroughfare then
devore and buck turned a corner they
proceeded for almost a block more
stopping finally before the entrance to a
small wooden building it seemed to
be an office for a sign over the door
read greater alaska mines and metals

  stacey drew back into the shadows
of a building on his side of the street
while devore produced a key and un-
locked the door then devore strode
inside buck following and the door
closed lights sprang on behind the
windows in front but in another mo-
ment shades were drawn

  crossing the street quickly stacey
slipped into the dense shadows filling
the space between the side of the build-
ing and the one next to it shades were
drawn behind the windows here too
but at one of the windows further back
stacey found the shade hadnt been
pulled entirely down to the sill the
bottom of the window was on a level
with hi chin he could see without
difficulty into the room beyond

  devore was standing at a desk a bare
five feet away his sharp olive face vis-
ible in profile bucks hulking form
was sprawled in a chair nearby

  as stacey watched devore reached
into the inner breast pocket of his suit
coat and pulled out an envelope he
toyed with it a moment smiling exult-
antly he said something to buck and
the giants thick lips stretched in a grin
stacey found by pressing close to the
window that he could hear almost every
word spoken

  best way to get rich but


mammoth adventure

quick devore was saying after all
buck nothing ventured nothing
gained

  you said it chief buck agreed

  devore went on i have the entire
map now and once i file a claim and
start mining the gold ill be top man
in these parts-financially speaking
and i wont have anything to worry
about gregg staceys out of the way
and as for the girl she swallowed the
story about her old man that i gave
her which means shell swallow any
other story i choose to give

  what about reddick chief buck
asked

  devore drew a finger across his
throat reddick would be able to
make too much trouble for me kid-
napping is a serious offense you know
and the money from the golden dream
wouldnt do me any good in jail well
go down to the trump card in the
morning and see that reddick is taken
care of

  devore toyed with the envelope an
instant longer then turned toward a
large safe placed against the wall on the
side of the room directly opposite sta-
cey devores back hid his manipula-
tions of the dial

ctacey waited no longer he
guessed that devores next move
after locking away the envelope would
be to leave the building with buck
stacey considered only briefly the idea
of waiting until the two left and then
tackling the safe in an attempt to re-
gain his half of the map it would
have been merely a waste of time he
was anything but an expert safecracker

  leaving the building quietly and cau-
tiously stacey strode swiftly back to
the hotel his pulses raced with ex-
citement devore had dropped a clue
leading directly to normas father

  at the hotel stacey went at once to

normas room the girl opened the
door at his knock and he hurried in-
side he checked an eager rush of
words as he saw norma had a visitor
it was haekstrom

  just dropped in about some business
matters that i didnt think youd feel
like discussing this afternoon haek-
strom explained he gazed at stacey
curiously norma told me about you
following devore and buck did you
turn up anything

  stacey nodded and proceeded to re-
late what he had overheard while eaves-
dropping on the pair he finished
devore doesnt know it yet but hes
furnished us with exactly the informa-
tion concerning normas father that we
want the reference to the trump
card in connection with warren red-
dick obviously means that the trump
card is the place where hes being kept
prisoner

  normas small face had brightened
with incredulous joy that means
everything isnt entirely hopeless after
all gregg we now have a chance to
rescue my father she frowned
slightly but where and just what is
the trump card

  its an abandoned mine about ten
miles out of town haekstrom replied
i believe devore holds the title to it
think youd care to take the risk
of leading me there stacey asked

  haekstroms broad features set de-
terminedly i dont see why not this
is my fight as much as yours

  stacey nodded good if we can
get warren reddick away from devore
well still have a fighting chance at the
golden dream according to what de-
vore himself said reddick knows that
devore is the person who is keeping him
prisoner by rescuing reddick well
have a weapon against devore-force
him to return my half of the map or
charge him with kidnapping devore
quest of the split map



knows that reddicks testimony would
form an air-tight case againsf him
you can count me in on anything
you do haekstrom said when do
we start for the trump card

  immediately if possible stacey
returned

  haekstrom hesitated ill need a
little time to get some things together
it wont take me long besides theres
a fairly good road leading to the trump
card and well be able to drive out in
my car

  stacey nodded quick agreement ill
wait for you then as for norma shell
remain at the hotel while were gone
normas red mouth tightened stub-
bornly i think i have something to
say about that gregg stacey i came
this far and i dont see why i shouldnt
go any further after all warren red-
dick is my father i ought to have a
chance to help him too

  stacey was about to remonstrate but
haekstrom shrugged and said itll be
all right for norma to come along with
us there wont be much if any dan-
ger devore wont be out to the trump
card until morning and he cant have
more than two men guarding reddick
stacey gave in and haekstrom left with
the understanding that stacey and nor-
ma were to get ready while he was gone

axtithin twenty minutes haek-
strom returned stacey and nor-
ma were waiting for him in normas
room they had both changed into
rough clothes

  haekstrom grinned took me a
little longer than i thought it would
he had removed his business suit and
now wore a wool jacket corduroy
breeches and laced boots

  what did if i may ask norma
inquired gregg seems to understand
but its a mystery to me

  well have to persuade your fathers

guards to let him go haekstrom re-
sponded i just went to get a little
persuasion guns in other words i
have two rifles and a revolver down in
the car

  oh normas brown eyes widened

  do  do you really think well
have to use them

 haekstrom nodded solemnly
theres a good chance

  i hope so for one stacey grunted
men wholl work for a skunk like de-
vore deserve to get shot he gestured
toward the door all right lets get
started

  they left the hotel unobtrusively
and haekstrom led the way to his car
a battered sedan parked at the curb
outside a moment later they were
moving toward the outskirts of grub-
stake

  the lights of the town dwindled and
presently vanished altogether behind a
turn in the road the sedans head-
lights bored into a darkness that was
deep and still and menacingly primeval
a wilderness reached out to gather them
in on either side rugged hills rose out
of broad stretches of fir and pine and
in the distance ahead a quarter moon
showed the tips of mountains a vast
jagged outline against the sky the
cool air streaming past the car was
fragrant with the mingled scents of
pine and wild flowers and moist grass

  stacey norma and haekstrom rode
in silence faces grave with thought of
the task before them after a while
haekstrom turned the sedan into a nar-
row rough dirt road they progressed
more slowly now lurching and bump-
ing

  almost t h e r e haekstrom an-
nounced at last he drove for several
minutes longer then brought the sedan
to a stop well have to walk from
here if i drove in too close the noise
from the car would give us way


mammoth adventure

  stacey and norma climbed out
haekstrom joined them after a moment
holding the revolver and two rifles and
a flashlight stacey took one of the
rifles and haekstrom handed the re-
volver to norma who declined it

  i have one of my own thanks the
girl explained she produced the little
revolver which stacey had seen back
in seattle

  haekstrom chuckled and shoved the
extra weapon into a pocket of his jack-
et with a gesture he swung into the
lead cautiously lighting the way with
the flashlight

  they followed the road along a line
of low hills on one side and a dense
stretch of brush and pines on the other
the road gradually grew steep curv-
ing around to meet the hills and enter-
ing them between a narrow pass be-
yond the pass the road slanted down to
the floor of a tiny valley

  haekstrom switched off the flash-
light this is it well really have
to be careful now

                                                                   

jdeering into the valley as his eyes
became adjusted to the unrelieved
darkness stacey saw a number of
lights they came from the windows of
a long low wooden building

  stacey caught haekstroms glance
and nodded grimly they started down
the descent stepping carefully over the
ruts and loose stones of the road a
number of other buildings shortly be-
came visible in the gloom these were
unlighted the only sign of life was
that shown by particular building upon
which they were closing in

  presently their objective was only a
scant dozen yards away they crept
forward moving with extreme caution
among rocks and clumps of brush
reaching the lighted building stacey
norma and haekstrom slipped up to
one of the nearest windows and peered

inside

  the illumination came from two ker-
osine lamps hanging on wires from the
low ceiling directly under one of the
lamps was a table at which two men sat
playing cards they were roughly
dressed and unshaven revolvers lay
close at hand on the table before each
bunks were placed around the sides of
the room in one of these visible across
the table lay a slim elderly man whose
disheveled sandy hair was streaked
with gray at the temples he seemed
to be asleep

 stacey glanced at norma she
nodded brown eyes suddenly filmed

  beckoning to haekstrom stacey
moved back from the window he whis-
pered 

  im going in through the door when
you hear me kick it open knock the
window in with your rifle and cover the
two guards from your side

  haekstrom nodded and stacey crept
toward the door he paused a moment
gathering himself then threw his shoul-
der against the panel in a sudden lunge
the door burst open amid a crash of
splintered wood stacey catapulted
into the room beyond the two guards
rose half out of their chairs hands
reaching instinctively for their guns

  dont stacey warned levelling
his rifle stay just as you were

  its no good son youve walked
into a trap warren reddick had sat
up in his bunk and was regarding sta-
cey sadly

  the two guards grinned and com-
pleted their act of reaching for their
weapons stacey stared in dazed in-
comprehension reddicks words flam-
ing in his mind then he realized that
haekstrom hadnt carried out his part
of the strategy what had happened

  the two guards had their revolvers
now they turned to stacey one of
them spoke
quest of the split map



  all right boyscout drop your iron
stacey swung the rifle the little that
was needed to cover the speaker-and
pulled the trigger

  the rifle clicked loudly in the silence
stacey pulled the trigger a few more
times then tossed the weapon aside
it hadnt been loaded

  from the doorway came a soft mock-
ing chuckle devore stepped into the
room after him followed buck thick
lips stretched in a huge grin then
came norma herded forward at the
point of haekstroms rifle

  stacey gazed at haekstrom bitterly
so you were in with devore all the
time eh

  it pays to be connected with the
right people haekstrom said

chapter v

gtacey took a deep breath fighting
down the sickness inside him i
understand now you warned devore
about what i was up to while pretend-
ing that you had to prepare for the trip
up here

  haekstrom nodded mark had a ten
minute start on us he told the boys
here that you were coming it was my
idea to give you an empty rifle and let
you jump through the door i intended
to suggest it if you didnt think of it
yourself mark and buck were waiting
behind one of the building outside all
we had to do was walk in once you had
made a fool out of yourself with that
empty rifle both were empty by the
way since i didnt know which one
youd pick i loaded mine later
what about chinook and the
burned cabin stacey asked was
that a trick too

  haekstrom shook his head no i
got a tip chinook was hiding there while
mark was gone we wanted him bad
as chinook knew where the golden

dream was but when i found the
cabin it was the way you saw it
devore chuckled satisfied mr
stacey

  as well as i can be under the cir-
cumstances stacey said shrugging

  i thought i finished you in seattle
devore said this time im going to
be more thorough one of the reasons
why this mine was given up is because
the main shaft leads directly into a huge
crevice-bottomless as far as i know
and it happens that the roof at that
part of the shaft is faulty knocking
away just so much as one of the sup-
ports will cause a cave in which is
just what i intend to do-once you the
girl and reddick are pushed into the
crevice

  norma released a low cry heedless
of the guns on all sides she ran to
where her father sat in the bunk and
buried her face in his chest sobbing

  devore watched in sardonic amuse-
ment i really hate to add insult to
injury miss reddick but ill have to
trouble you for your half of the map
mr haekstrom told me about the little
deception which was practiced on me
in seattle quite clever i never re-
alized i had been tricked

  you can go to the hotel in grub-
stake and get it if you want to norma
snapped

  tut tut im sure you consider
the map too valuable to leave in hotel
rooms miss reddick i have no doubt
but that you have the map with you
right now

i hid it-and its going to stay hid
im afraid youre forcing me to have
buck search you devore glanced at
his giant satellite youd like that
wouldnt you buck

  buck leered sure chief

jorma looked at buck and shud-
dered she hesitated a moment


mammoth adventure

then reached into the neck of her
blouse she pulled out an envelope and
threw it to the floor there just
keep that monster away from me

  devore was unable to hide his gloat-
ing triumph as he retrieved the en-
velope and examined its contents
well thats that since there now is
no longer any reason for keeping you
people alive i suggest that we start for
the mine at once

  the volcano of fury and despair
seething inside stacey boiled over he
reached devore in two quick steps and
his fist smashed squarely into the
others face

  a gun went off something burned a
furrow along staceys shoulder then
buck emitted a bellow of rage and
rushed at stacey wildly ducking under
the swing of a huge fist stacey plunged
his fist into the giants midriff buck re-
leased a grunt of surprise and pain he
stood for a moment as though frozen
the flat of one hand pressed against the
injured spot stacey swung again the
blow caught buck on the jaw and sent
him reeling backward to crash against
the table

  stacey was given no chance to follow
up one of the two guards had circled
behind him and now the barrel of the
mans revolver flashed down the
room went black

dough hands slapped stacey
awake the first person he saw
was haekstrom who had evidently been
working over him stacey sat up on
the floor pain flashed and roared in-
side his head his cheeks burned from
repeated slaps and his shoulder was
stiff and sore where the bullet had
grazed him

  xorma was seated on the bunk with
her father her eyes were red and
swollen reddick looked unutterably
weary the lines of his face sagging with

hopelessness

  devore was seated on the table
smoking a cigarette his nose had evi-
dently bled a lot and his upper lip was
discolored and larger than normal he
eyed stacey balefully

  i could have had you tossed down
the crevice while you were out but that
way youd have missed the fun now
that yourre awake well get started
at an order from devore buck
hauled stacey to his feet buck didnt
try to be gentle about it great waves
of agony battered stacey threatening
to engulf him he clung to awareness
with dogged effort

  devore crushed out his cigarette and
stood erect he picked up two lan-
terns that stood already lighted on the
table and handed one to haekstrom
all right lets go

  devore and haekstrom led the way
out of the building buck followed
next clutching the back of staceys
jacket in one hand and propelling him
forward with repeated jabs of the re-
volver in the other norma and red-
dick brought up the rear forced along
by the two guards reddick was able
to hobble along with the aid of a crude
crutch he fell several times

  the procession wound it way over
the valley floor toward a rectangular
opening at the base of a large hill de-
vore and haekstrom strode into the
opening their lanterns lighting the way
for the others in the rear they were
swallowed up by a long tunnel that
slanted steadily downward the air
became clammy and dank as the de-
scent continued to stacey breathing
it seemed like inhaling the very at-
mosphere of death itself the thought
made realization of what lay ahead sud-
denly sharp and clear in his mind

  the tunnel abruptly broadened out
ending at the brink of a broad chasm
fully twenty feet across it was a nat-
quest of the split map



ural pocket in the earth which the man-
made tunnel had intersected the roof
of the cavern was formed by huge rock
slabs that sagged precariously pre-
vented from falling only by numerous
support beams

  devore held his lantern high and
glanced at haekstrom never been
here before have you

  haekstrom shook his head a grow-
ing unease showed on his broad face

  devore gestured at the crevice
nothing to worry about theres no
bottom to this thing just take a look
haekstrom peered cautiously over
the edge of the chasm extending his
lantern over it devore smiled slightly
-and pushed haekstrom vanished
he left a scream behind him a scream
that seemed to go on and on growing
fainter before is suddenly ended

  one less to divide with devore
said cheerfully he looked at stacey
see what i have in mind for you how
do you like the idea

  youre mad to think you can get
away with it stacey pointed out
well be missed sooner or later the
authorities will connect you with our
disappearance

  theyll never prove anything de-
vore returned confidently youll be
hundreds of feet under the earth buried
under tons of rock and sand anyway
you were last seen with haekstrom-
and haekstroms dead no trail lead-
ing to me there chinook vervain might
have been able to figure things out but
hes dead too devores air of studied
suavity abruptly vanished his sharp
features became set and cruel ive
wasted enough time on you the sooner
i get this over with the better ill like it
buck-over with them

ctacey felt bucks great trap-like
hands close inexorably over him
he heard norma scream

  then with stunning unexpectedness
came the repeated insistent honking of
an auto horn

  buck gasped and involuntarily re-
leased stacey devore stood as though
frozen staring toward the tunnel
mouth

  the honking came again

 somebodys outside devore
hissed he whirled to buck give
me your gun ill watch these people
you go with hank and matt and see
whos out there

  buck obeyed the orders automatic-
ally shortly he disappeared up the tun-
nel with the two guards

  devore placed his lantern on a rocky
projection and settled down to wait
he kept licking his lips nervously
glancing from stacey to the tunnel en-
trance

  in another moment the sound of
shots rang out striking like sudden
thunder into the tense stillness it
startled devore into inattention for just
the instant stacey had been waiting for
he left the ground in a leap catching
devore about the legs they hit the
ground in a squirming tangle a scant
dozen feet from the edge of the chasm

  once he had recovered from the sur-
prise of staceys attack devore fought
like a madman his struggles were the
frenzied struggles of one who has had
victory within his grasp and feels it
slipping away he had dropped his
weapon in falling his fingers having
splayed instinctively to clutch for sup-
port the gun had hit the ground a
few feet short of the crevice devore
sought frantically to kick loose from
stacey in the effort to regain it

  stacey was unable to maintain his
grip he rolled aside quick as a cat
devore scrambled to hands and knees
and lunged for the gun stacey caught
devores jerkily retreating ankles and
pulled desperately devore was


mammoth adventure

stretched flat on his chest the wind
leaving him in a pained gasp but in
the next instant threshing wildly he
broke staceys hold on his ankles
whirled and pushed himself erect

  as stacey climbed to his feet devore
closed in with a barrage of swift numb-
ing punches momentarily confused
stacey gave ground shielding his face

  norma cried gregg-look out
the edge

  stacey stopped barely in time he
ducked under pistoning jabs of de-
vores fists and caught the other around
the waist they wrestled for some sec-
onds with quiet savagery one straining
away the other pushing toward the
brink of the chasm

  slowly slowly teeth clenched face
beaded with sweat stacey forced de-
vore back then suddenly he broke
free and began to hammer in blows of
his own devore dodged away but
stacey closed in quickly and relentless-
ly he battered down devores guard
and while it was down shot a numbing
punch to the others middle following
it almost instantly with a piledriver
cross to the jaw

gyes glassy devore went staggering
backward he teetered for a mo-
ment on the edge of the chasm-and
then he was gone

  good work lad a deep voice ap-
proved

  it was a voice that stacey had never
heard before he turned puzzledly

  a man strode into the circle of light
cast by the lantern he was short and
thick-set with deeply tanned features
that had a faintly indian cast his lips
were parted in a broad smile revealing
large teeth that seemed startlingly white
by contrast with his skin he wore a
wool jacket with denim trousers stuffed
into boots a battered felt hat was
pushed to the back of his head reveal-

ing grizzled black hair he held a rifle
in the crook of one arm

  chinook warren reddick gasped
chinook he hobbled forward with
his crutch and grasped the others arm
unbelievingly but    but devore
said you were dead

  chinook vervains smile broadened
still more it didnt hurt anything to
let him and his friends think so i
burned the cabin down on purpose
leaving a bear i had killed inside so
that when the bones were found people
would think i had burned up with the
cabin devore and haekstrom were
trying to find me and were getting a
little too close for comfort especially
haekstrom he was trying to beat de-
vore out of the golden dream

  but how did you get here stacey
demanded and wheres buck and
the other two men

  i saw you and miss reddick up at
the burned cabin with haekstrom this
afternoon vervain explained i do
all my hunting up there so it wasnt
just luck i knew haekstrom was in
with devore and decided id better
keep an eye on you and miss reddick
it wasnt so easy because haekstrom
and devore had cars and i have to do
my traveling on a horse i followed you
miss reddick and haekstrom when
you left grubstake this evening the
tire tracks of the car led me to the
trump card riding a horse i got
here almost too late

  but i saw devore and haekstrom
taking the bunch of you down into the
mine and guessed what was going on i
couldnt tackle devore and the others
all at once so i waited until they went
into the mine then i pressed the horn
of devores car which hed parked be-
hind one of the old mine buildings not
far away when buck and the other
two came running out of the mine i
picked them off as easy as eaiing pie
quest of the split map



  reddick grinned and thumped chi-
nooks shoulder he seemed younger
and stronger already he glanced at
stacey and norma

  theres a lot more to be explained i
think but first id like to get out of
here after all the time ive spent
cooped up in this place theres nothing
more i want right now than to have
lights noise and people around me

  chinook hurried to comply he took
the lantern and with reddick limping
at his side lead the way out of the tun-
nel

  stacey and norma followed slowly
stacey was thoughtful

  with chinook alive we wont have
any trouble about filing a claim to the
golden dream that means were as
good as rich right now i    ah   
suppose that with your share youll

open up that dress shop you men-
tioned

  i suppose so norma murmured

  about myself stacey went on
even more thoughtfully i think im
going to stay here and help your
father run the business-including the
golden dream as part of it this is a
nice country clean with plenty of el-
bow room good place to raise children
too

  wonderful country norma agreed

  stacey said desperately but it
wouldnt be wonderful at all unless a
certain girl-that is    well look
norma wouldnt you rather open up a
little cottage instead of that doggoned
dress shop of yours

  norma grinned i think the idea
has a dress shop beat hollow

ruffian dick explorer

 	by robert clayton	

little known to the world at large in the
th century there lived a great man he
will not be remembered for the good things
he has done there was nothing of the humani-
tarian in him a selfish adventurous soul he was
completely consumed by one feverish desire to
do what others dared not attempt to make him-
self notorious by his daring and yet this com-
pletely self-centered mania which possessed him
demonstrated that even it could be utilized in the
discovery of truth

  richard burton was an explorer of great but
unrealized worth it was not until years after
his death that the value of his wonderings was
established he was bom in england in march
of the year  his father a retired army of-
ficer suffered from asthma seeking relief from
his suffering he led his family from one country
to another and returned to england young
richard as a result was learning greek at the
age of three and latin at the age of four he
was unusually receptive and attentive to all the
languages he heard in those youthful days he
was all his life to be a great language-learner

and language-user they were the means to de-
veloping and satisfying his curiosity ways of
escape from that sense of frustration that was
to haunt him all his days

  young richard was a continual source of worry
to his parents his pranks caused him to be re-
garded first as an imp and then as a scoundrel in
thei eyes in pisa mt vesuvius loomed mysteri-
ously for him on the horizon there was nothing
for him to do but explore it for himself he wasnt
content with reaching the crater for the fumes
twisting slow wreathings of smoke far below his
feet intrigued him considerably he had himself
lowered to investigate and as a result was al-
most suffocated

  in  though not yet twenty years of age
he was sent to oxford to trinity college in the
company of his brother edward trinity as
might be expected bored infuriated and amused
richard he bought a gun and amused himself
on the campus with it he took to rowing to
fencing to anything but lectures only one sub-
ject interested him and that was the study of

the glories of conquest were gone from new
spain in their place marched a haggard troop
of soldiery bent on a futile mission of death

gone now was the great show of
pageantry the banners no
longer fluttered proudly in the
blazing sun of new spain and the ar-
mored soldiers of charles  had lost
their great air of bravado the raw
land had reached up to smite the con-
quistadors and the glory of the span-
ish crown dragged in the dust coro-
nado had said we fear not for our
lives for the arm of the true god is
over us but it seemed to every man
from mounted cavalier to lowly foot
soldier that only the dark spirit el
diablo traveled with them

  the advance patrol of don carlos de
hernandez who was as fanatical as
coronado himself wasted itself upon
the unknown desert and if this mad-
ness continued was surely doomed

  me thinks even don carlos be-
gan to say that this heathen devil
of an indio lies

  his doubt was confided only to his
nephew don miguel cordova a very
young man who was fresh from spain
and upon his virgin adventure but
don miguel was not surprised he too
had suspicions of the native guide a
cunning fellow who talked a few words


mammoth adventure

of the white mans tongue learned from

the good friars and professed to be a
christian but  a wondrous city
called quivira where there was a great
tree hung with countless bells of pure
gold-where every native possessed
dishes of the same bright metal as well
as jugs and images and all manner of
ornaments to even so young and in-
experienced a man as don miguel it
seemed beyond belief yet it was qui-
vira that the conquistadors sought
don miguel   

  the cry came from an agonized
throat don miguel turned his gaunted
mount about and saw that yet another
man had fallen the eighth in two
days madre de dios thought miguel
and felt pity in his heart that he too
might die here in this empty land
seemed a certainty yet his heart could
go out to these other wretched humans

  he saw how the foot soldiers-only
the two caballeros were mounted-
straggled in a ragged line they were
crossbowmen arquebusiers and swords-
men transported across the seas and
now turned into sorry creatures by the
desert no longer did the dream of
riches lay in their dulled eyes no
fanaticism drove them as it did the
fierce don carlos but the indian
bearers who came last moved steadily
under their burdens and were un-
touched by blazing sun and scorching
heat they are the children of this
land thought miguel and so it can-
not harm them

  miguel come along

  don carlos was shouting from his
place at the head of the column he
was looking back at his nephew and
the fires of hell seemed to glitter in his
black eyes he had a hawkish beak of
a nosea cruel traplike mouth don
carlos was one of coronados most
trusted captains there was no mercy
in him no sympathy for the weak if

a man fell he remained where he fell
again don carlos bellowed miguel
come along

  but the fallen man cried out have
mercy- 

  miguel was swayed he ignored his
uncles command risked don carlos
temper he rode back and dismounted
he took the goatskin waterbag from his
saddle and he knelt-with an effort
because of his armor-to give the sol-
dier water the goatskin was more
than half empty when the man ended
his greedy gulping gracias don
miguel    you are a good man
you must get to your feet mateo
i cannot

  i will help you my friend and
you will ride my horse

  that was unthinkable a mere cross-
bowman riding while a castillian don
walked the soldier shook his head
leave me he said but miguels arms
were already about him already lifting
him

  miguel got him onto the horse then
handed him his heavy crossbow and
sheath of arrows they went on and
a life had been saved for how long
miguel did not know

rjhey made night camp by a great
arroyo tana had promised that
there would be life-giving water in the
creek bed and there was none at all
the indian was a squat man of middle
age he had a bland sort of face but
his darkeyes were full of guile he
wore a religious emblem from a chain
about his neck the gift of the friars
with whom he had associated he
showed chagrin as don carlos in a
black temper questioned him about
their failure to find water but it seemed
to the watching young miguel that
tana was not at all put out it seemed
that the indian had known from the
start that his promise of water would
valiant dust



not be fulfilled

  one days march tana now said
in his bad spanish we come then to
the land of the humped cibolo-cattle
bigger than those of the white men
and there is quivira

  quivira

  the name fell from the indians lips
with a magic sound and perhaps he
believed in it but miguel knew with-
out understanding why that there was
no such wondrous city tana lied
whether he knew it or not and he was
leading the patrol to its death miguel
looked at his uncle don carlos had
removed his flanged helmet he sat
upon a rock a big man with pointed
beard and bristling mustaches he
stared at tana with a cruel smile and
he said one days march    then
it is either quivira or i will have your
tongue out 

  miguel saw tanas ready answering
smile and he turned away in disgust
he had lost faith what was to have
been a glorious adventure a quest to
add land and wealth to the spanish
crown had degenerated into a shabby
effort of a band of men to stand off a
creeping death there was no glory
nothing but greed motivated don car-
los   for miguel knew that his
uncle was impoverished and was seek-
ing to find riches for himself-so that
he might retire comfortably to spain-
rather than to raise the banner of spain
over a fabulous city greed was don
carlos fanaticism his madness

  the campfires glowed red pushed
back the eerie desert night the span-
iards hunkered down munching their
half-rotted food and sipping their wine
-when what they really needed was a
bellyful of water they talked in low
uneasy voices they stayed close to the
brush fires like children afraid of the
dark the indian bearers actually
slaves kept apart from the white men

and talked among themselves in their
unintelligible tongue miguel went be-
yond the camp and peered into the
darkness almost as though hoping to
see something of what the indian guide
promised-a fine city wells full of
crystal clear water the great humped
cattle gold that did not need to be
mined    he believed none of it
but in his heart he still faintly hoped

  he stepped by a growth of jagged
cactus heard a rattling sound and
drew his sword while his heart for an
instant stood still a creature slithered
toward him a snake struck at his leg
fangs against the steel greave protect-
ing the leg miguel struck down with
the sword then withdrew back to the
camp he was a man greatly shaken

a dark figure loomed a man com-
ing to meet miguel it was mateo
the crossbowman now somewhat re-
covered from his weakness of mid-day
something is wrong don miguel
miguel saw that the soldier had his
crossbow loaded and ready he said
nothing mateo nothing but a snake
mateo shuddered this land is lost
to the devil he whispered only hel
could be so bad the men are say-
in   

  saying what friend

  mateo hesitated as though afraid his
words would bring him trouble but
then they are saying that the indian
is leading us deeper and deeper across
this barrens so that we will die terribly
they say he hates all men whose faces
are white and don carlos-

  they are saying don carlos is
mad miguel prompted as the soldier
broke off it may well be  i will
talk again to my uncle

  he walked through the camp and
found don carlos still perched upon
the boulder like a man enthroned but
now wrapped in his once proud but now


mammoth adventure

shabby cassock one thing about don
carlos miguel realized was his cour-
age he had the heart of a lion and
he feared nothing on earth he was
proud and arrogant and he would go
on even though he lost every man of the
patrol

  a lanky hatchet-faced soldier sat
crosslegged on the ground before the
don he was the patrols scribe and
in the glow of a fire he was writing
upon parchment with a quill dipped in
ink don carlos was dictating in a low
voice and finally he said now i will
make my mark and affix my seal

  quill and parchment were handed to
don carlos and he made his mark
the scribe heated wax dabbed some
upon the parchment and don carlos
pressed his signet ring upon the seal
he looked up at miguel with a friendly
smile that was a rare thing

  i am making ready for the event of
my death my nephew he said he
rolled the parchment and handed it to
miguel should i not live out this
adventure then you shall inherit the
de hernandez estate in spain he
lifted his hand as though to halt any
protest miguel might utter no it
must be so you and i miguel are
all the remain of our family it is good
that my property should go to you

  i am overwhelmed said miguel
yet he knew that all that remained to
don carlos estate was a farm of little
worth but what if i do not live
uncle

  you should make some disposal of
the rich lands you inherited from your
father miguel said don carlos you
might have made such a document as
this one i have given you-in my name
although you are young and strong
and will surely live to see spain
again    he looked at miguel with
his bright eyes oddly veiled but it
is a matter for you to decide

  miguel nodded he saw that there
was wisdom in his uncle it would be
a good thing to make sure that the
cordova estate did not pass out of the
family in the event that he don
miguel lost his life he feared don
carlos yet he respected him and who
could say that blood was not a strong
tie miguel said i will sign such a
document don carlos and so had the
scribe write out the testament unlike
his uncle miguel had learned to read
and write he signed the parchment
with a steady hand then gave it to don
carlos

  but we must not die here he said
i ask you my uncle to turn back be-
fore it is too late

  the friendliness went out of the
older mans manner and now his face
darkened with quick rage i ask no
sniveling boy for advice he all but
shouted

  and miguel then knew for a cer-
tainty that don carlos had no real
doubts about the existence of a golden
city called quivira

jphat night miguel nearly died he
awoke and was suffocating some
heavy cloth had been thrown over his
face it was his own velvet cassock
the cassock was held -in place to
smother his breath and his voice by
strong hands that were also closed hard
about his throat terror gripped his
mind and for an instant he could not
fight back blackness seeped into his
brain his lungs seemed ready to burst
for want of air but then he managed
to get a dagger from its sheath and into
his hand he raised the weapon and
struck blindly the blade struck against
his assailants breastplate and slid off
he thrust again and again trying to
strike flesh he was squirming fight-
ing now with a wildness then the
throttling hands left his throat the
valiant dust



weight of his attacker was lifted from
his weakening body

  miguel lay gasping still feebly strik-
ing out with the dagger but his attack-
er was gone and he was safe  at
the very moment when he would have
lost consciousness he was too shaken
in his mind to throw the smothering
cassock from his face but now that the
choking pressure was gone he could get
enough air even through the heavy
cloth his throat ached was swollen
thick and there was a numbness all
through him

  finally some of the weakness left
him he flung aside the cassock he
sucked in great gulps of air he saw
the night sky the stars he pushed
himself up on his elbows and looked
about the camp seemed asleep in its
entirety no lurking figure moved
about in flight men lay sprawled un-
moving miguel looked toward where
don carlos slept    his uncle lay
nearest him not more than ten paces
off but miguel could hear the rattly
snore of don carlos breathing and it
seemed that he must be asleep yet
someone had tried to murder him mi-
guel fiad only to feel of his throat to
know that it had not been a mere night-
mare

  he rose reaching for his waterbag
he drank and his mind seemed to clear
he stood thinking knowing  it had
beeh don carlos the soldiers had
nothing against him so they had no
reason to want him dead but that
document he had signed and given to
don carlos it was reason enough for
murder to a greed-mad man despair
if not hatred filled the heart of miguel
he moved toward his uncle the dagger
still in his hand he stood over don
carlos a wild desire to kill in him-
a urgent need to get back that docu-
ment gripping him

  but miguel hesitated he could not

kill don carlos

  he shuddered and went back to his
bed-place but he did not close his eyes
in sleep during the remainder of the
night

ihe sun climbed into the brassy
sky against the deserts distant
rim a heat haze shimmered in con-
stant waves the pathetic column
moved on heading northward once
more driven by don carlos mocking
voice the morning ration of water
had been parcelled out so much for
don carlos a little less to don miguel
cordova a smaller amount to each
foot soldier and even less to the in-
dians tana the fool had taken his
in an earthenware bowl and then had
deliberately spilled it to the dust he
had grinned wolfishly at the watching
white men had mocked them agua
he had said water-end of days
march

  miguel thought of that as he rode
along behind don carlos it had been
a crazy thing throwing away water
that was worth all the gold that was
supposed to be at quivira or was it
crazy wondered miguel it might be
that tana was merely baiting the span-
iards on

  miguels horse was dying under him
miguel himself was in bad shape per-
haps out of the fear forced upon him
by last nights attempt upon his life
his throat still hurt proof enough of
how close a call it had been he
watched his uncle sought guilt in the
man but don carlos was not a per-
son to reveal his hidden thoughts even
now don carlos said miguel you
are silent this day has the desert
sickness gotten you

  they rode side by side the failing
horses slowed to an uncertain walk
miguel said i was nearly murdered
in my sleep in the night


mammoth adventure

  murdered said don carlos and
swore a round oath my nephew set
upon by a murderer who was the
blackguard name him miguel and
i will cut his heart out

  miguel had hoped to startle the older
man into some sign of guilt but don
carlos was a fox as well as a lion and
as miguel made no answer he said
one of the natives i swear

  miguels horse stopped quivering
in every muscle its eyes had a wild
look miguel dismounted and none
too soon the animal collapsed a vic-
tim of its thirst miguel removed the
waterbag from the saddle and there
was nothing more to salvage he looked
up and found don carlos watching him
with a thin smile ah well said the
older man you are young and strong
tana too had stopped to watch his
eyes were malignant

  miguel learned the agony of being
afoot on the endless desert he re-
moved the steel greaves from his legs
threw them away    and later re-
lieved himself of the weight of his
breastplate his helmet he retained
as protection against the sun he kept
too his sword and his dagger for a
soldier must not abandon his arms

  the sun climbed overhead began the
descent westward the partol lost two
more of its men they fell and the scant
portion of water that could be afforded
them was no help at all the survivors
complained with despairing mutters
but don carlos was too much their
master for mutiny to flare the mad-
ness continued and now there seemed
no escape at all to turn back meant
death for now even that chance was
gone

rjhe sun arced downward a fiery
red ball at the deserts rim don
carlos called a halt he was by some
miracle still mounted and the man

showed little strain but then don
carlos had had the lions share of the
precious water he called up two of
the arquebusiers and ordered them to
lay down their firearms he pointed
to tana

  seize the heathen he ordered

  the indian guide was roughly seized
and don carlos said stake him out
the order was quickly obeyed and
the indian soon lay spread-eagled and
helpless on the ground a fire of brush
was built up a knife blade heated to
a glowing red dismounted now don
carlos received the blade and walked
to the indian this was a game a con-
quistador really understood

  a liar and a fool are one said
don carlos heathen you will talk
you will tell us how to reach quivira
manana said tana

  no not tomorrow heathen now


  miguel had to turn away he heard
the indians wild scream his nostrils
caught the odor of burning flesh he
was sickened and his whole nature re-
volted it went on and on until miguel
could stand no more he swung around
shouting enough don carlos i for
one can stand no more

  don carlos looked up ah you
cross me nephew

  you are the fool miguel said wild-
ly you should know there is no
place like this quivira this indian
for some secret reason hates us span-
iards-perhaps for some wrong done
him or his people he has lied but he
is no fool he has baited us into this
devils den and now we are lost-just
as he wanted but i will have no more
of this madness

mutiny said don carlos rising
he flung away the torture knife he
was smiling with some evil thought as
though this was a thing he found to
his liking and to miguel it was sud-
valiant dust



denly very clear don carlos had failed
to murder him in the night but now
he had his victim in an even better trap
don carlos would never find the gol-
den city of quivira but he was hoping
to escape from the desert-to return
to spain and claim for himself the rich
cordova estate he would have mi-
guel die here now it was a thought
alive in the glittering black eyes

  seize this mutineer ordered don
carlos

  the haggard dull-eyed soldiers
stared and were unmoving a kind-
ness occasionally given now repaid don
miguel cordova don carlos saw that
here was more mutiny and he swore
with a great blasphemy he drew his
great sword with a flourish

  be my witnesses he said i pun-
ish a mutineer

  he lunged at miguel whose armor
had that day been discarded miguel
dodged the first deadly blow then drew
his own sword the naked blades
glinted dully in the fading light the
two men fought with savage strokes
with lightning thrusts don carlos
drew first blood a stab to miguels left
arm the soldiers made way for them
the indian stared with dull fascina-
tion the tortured tana forgot his
own pain to strain in his bounds and
watch miguels blade glanced off don
carlos armor he was beaten back
and back but he could move more
quickly and now he swung a great
stroke the blades clashed and don
carlos weapon was knocked from his
hand miguel held his point to his
uncles throat

t should kill you he said gasp-
ing for breath but i let you
live because you are of my own blood
you will harken don carlos-i am
taking command we shall forget
quivira and try to find our way out of

this death trap mutiny well enough
i shall stand before coronado if we

live

  he turned from don carlos and had
his slight arm wound bandaged by one
of the soldiers then he went to tana
mateo he ordered release this poor
devil

  he could see that the indian was
dying don carlos torture had not
loosened a tongue but it had taken a
life a sip of water was given to tana
and then he talked to the indian bear-
ers he talked long and the others
nodded finally tana turned his dull-
ing eyes toward miguel

  it is good to find one a man with a
clean heart among the spaniards he
said in his awkward spanish his voice
was weak a mere whisper i have
told my people to take you out of the
desert amigo water is not so far
you will be safe- a shudder swept
over him then there is no qui-
vira  

  miguel rose from kneeling beside the
dying indian then he heard the sol-
dier mateo cry out some warning he
turned and saw don carlos lunging at
him almost on him a dagger striking
down fear clutched at miguel he
tried to jump backward but he tripped
and fell don carlos bent over him his
black eyes full of a look of triumph
but the knife blade missed miguels
throat by a scant margin a crossbow
had twanged an arrow drove through
the neck of don carlos the don
fell he died hard   

rjphe sun was gone a purplish haze
lay over the desert the indian
bearers were already setting out to lead
the way to water as tana had ordered
them two shallow graves had been
opened and were now filled in rocks
were gathered a cairn was raised the
small pathetic band of conquistadors

stood by the burying-place the cross-
bowman mateo was pale and shaken
he had killed a spanish don one
of coronados captains and that meant
punishment

 miguel read mateos unspoken fears
he stooped and picked the arrow which
had been withdrawn from the dead
mans neck he snapped it in two

belles ad from elbow lake minnesota with
him was the tidy sum of one thousand dollars
to be used to pay off the mortgage on his in-
tended farm for almost a week he was seen
about the house then one day he wasnt there
john moo has never been seen since

  george anderson was the next to arrive and
like both peter gunness and john moo was a
norwegian by birth demonstrating a certain
well-placed wariness of the kind and honest
widow anderson did not bring much money with
him to belles place attracted by belles de-
scription of herself in one of the marriage papers
anderson made the trip to laporte with the in-
tention of matrimony after the usual amenities
george was seriously considering returning home
to get what might be termed the entrance fee and
then marrying the woman but something oc-
curred to make him throw aside these plans
during his stay at the farm he awoke in the
night and broke out in a cold sweat at finding
himself meeting the gaze of belle who had been
peering intently into his face a lighted candle in
her hand what she intended to do if anything
george never found out with a yell he leaped
out of bed into his clothes and out the door
as fast as he could go at the railroad depot the
frightened mr anderson hopped the first train
for his home town

  in the next few months ray lamphere was
hired to help out on the farm it was about this
time that young jennie olson took a trip to
california as belle explained to the neighbors
jennie was never seen after that midsummer of


  the gunness farm began to assume an aura of
mystery hack drivers in la porte told of de-
livering trunks at night the neighbors noted
belie kept the shutters on her house tightly drawn
both day and night farmers going by late at
night often saw belle herself on the prowl around
her barn or in a small yard some fifty by seventy-
five feet which she had recently enclosed with
an eight-foot fence of stout and fine wire mesh

  the cellar of the house was always kept locked
except during the hog butchering season at

across his knee he threw the broken
pieces to the dust

 don carlos de hernandez died
he said of the desert sickness

  he turned and walked after the in-
dians followed by his sorry band and
what would tell if men did not the
secrets of the trail to quivira

the end

these times a stray neighbor or two had happened
to call when belle was in the cellar her sleeves
rolled up wielding a knife and cleaver with un-
usual skill all around the room lay implements
of the butchering profession

  the stream of suitors continued in  and
 ole budsberg arrived with  in his
pocket and andrew k helgelein with  and
neither has ever been seen since belles smooth
plans seemed to be clicking in good order that
is until she and lamphere had a disagreement
he like many another poor man had fallen in
love with her jealousy had made him pack up
his belongings and leave in laporte he told
friends that belle owed him back wages he in-
timated that he knew enough about belle to make
her pay him not only his wages but to keep his
mouth shut too

  lampheres talking must have frightened belle
she had him arrested on complaint that he was
insane and a menace to the public found sane
by the court he was prompuy released and then
trouble came from another quarter a letter ar-
rived from mr asle helgelein wanting to know
what had become of his brother andrew

  belle gunness was worried she told an at-
torney in laporte that she was mortally in fear
of roy lamphere the ex-hired man she said
he had threatened to kill her and promised to
burn her house down with these threats hang-
ing over her she wanted to make out her will
there was nothing out of order about the will
it left her estate to her three children in case
the children did not survive her the estate was
to go to a norwegian orphanage in chicago

  on the day following the signing of the will
farmers on the mcclung road saw the gunness
home in flames it burned to the ground only
the hired man joe maxon escapcd and he said
he barely made it noise of the flames licking
at his room had awakened him be said and he
jumped out his second-story window in his un-
derwear he vowed that just before jumping he
had shouted loudly to wake mrs gunness and
the children but had received no reply they had
been in the house when he went to bed

  when the embers had cooled slightly searchers
found four bodies three were readily identified
as those of belles daughters and of philip gun-
ness her son the other corpse was the headless
body of a woman all four were found on a

female bluebeard

female bluebeard



mattress in the cellar on top of them were the
charred remains of belle fine upright piano

  the first move made by the sheriff was to
arrest roy lamphere a neighbors boy claimed
he had seen launphere running from the gun-
ness place just before the flames were noticed
lamphere was indicted for murder and a charge
of arson was left hanging over him just in case
the other charge wasnt sufficient the victim
named in the murder charge was mrs gunness
but soon people began to wonder whether the
headless body belonged to mrs gunness

  those who had seen her talked with her and
did business with her were quick to state that
the body was too small to be that of belle gun-
ness physicians measured the charred remains
of the headless woman making proper allow-
ances for the missing head and neck they con-
cluded that the corpse was that of a woman
five feet three inches tall weighing about one
hundred and fifty pounds belle as those who
knew her agreed had not been a hair under five
feet seven and weighed at least  pounds if
not more

  clerks in the town who had sold mrs gunness
various articles of wearing apparel were inter-
viewed and they were able to furnish valuable
information as to her clothing sizes these fig-
ures were compared with measurements made by
the examining physicians the two sets of figures
indicated that the body found in the cellar must
be that of someone other than belle

  while the baffled authorities busied themselves
in the hunt for the head or the skull of the corpse
asle helgelein appeared on the scene he was
the brother of andrew and had come in search
of him he told the sheriff of his fears that
andrew had somehow been done in by this
woman he had come to marry

  a very thorough inspection of the grounds
followed the diggers went to work in the high-
fenced yard under the soft earth they came
upon rubbish of every sort among the dis-
order of old cans and bottles lay an innocent
looking sack andrews remains were found in-
side hacked up but still in a recognizable con-
dition before sun-down that same day four
more bodies were unearthed one of these was
identified as jennie olson the girl who had gone
to california after the third day of digging in
the yard a total of ten bodies were found so
many bodies and unrelated parts of skeletons
were found that it was hard to estimate just
how many people had met their end at the
gunness farm

  a rumor grew and spread in laporte

  dr ira p norton a laporte dentist recalled
that he had done some dental work for the
late mrs gunness work which he could easily
identify if found the problem at this point of
the investigation was how to sift the ashes and
debris of a large house and find a few small
teeth louis schults a public-spirited citizen of
the town heard of the quandary and went to

the officers with a suggestion he offered to put
all his talents acquired in the yukon as a gold
miner at their disposal with some lumber he
could build a regular gold-mine sluice box right
on belles place the schultz offer was readily
accepted the sluice was built in belles front
yard water was piped from the barn and louis
went to work on the strangest mining job of his
career

  thousands gathered to cheer him on as he
shoveled tons of debris and washed it down over
the riffles newspaper photographers flocked to
the scene bets were made on the outcome chi-
cago bookies formed pools on the day and hour
louis would strike pay dirt on may  after
four days of hard work louis came upon the
piece of dental bridgework he had been looking
lor dr norton examined it carefully and pos-
itively identified the piece as the work he had
done for mrs gunness

  ray lamphere the ex-farm hand went on trial
in laporte for the murder acquitted on that
charge he was tried for arson and convicted
obviously the jury did not believe mrs gun-
ness was dead confined in a prison in mich-
igan city lamphere told what he knew to his
cellmate myers in  when lamphere died
myers repeated the story to prison officials

  highlights of the account were that despite
the evidence of the dental work the body was
that of a woman belle had lured from illinois
on the promise of housework then killed and
beheaded to prevent proper identification the
head had been destroyed in quicklime lamphere
claimed that belle had killed the four children
one after another then piled the bodies on the
mattress after dressing the womans corpse in
some of her own clothes

  lamphere was sure that belle had done away
with at least forty-two men getting large amounts
of cash varying from  to  from each
usually she first drugged their coffee then bashed
in their heads while they were in a stupor she
then dissected the bodies on the big table in the
cellar tied the parts into neat bundles and buried
them in the locked yard occasionally she put
the bodies into the hog-scalding vat and added
generous amounts of quick-lime

  lamphere admitted to myers that he had helped
belle bury several bodies but denied he ever had
a part in the actual killing although lamphere
was convinced belle did not die in the fire the
police have not ever caught up with her many
people around lapore believe she is still roving
in a distant part of the world

  the legend of this female bluebeard still lives
on and has become a permanent part of the
folklore of that region of indiana a song is
still sung about her which begins like this

belle gunness lived in indian

she always always had a man

ten at least went in her door-

and were never never seen no more

we were sitting in the
shade leaning against a
building and looking out
across the waters of the tompkinsville
navy yard to a ferry that was coming
to staten island from manhattan we
werent talking much because it was too
hot to talk it was almost too hot to
live on a day like that

  a one-and-a-half striper came walk-
ing down the dock to some pcs that
were tied up near us id seen him be-
fore and knew he was the skipper of

the nearest of those pcs i watched
him go aboard the way he turned aft
to flick a salute to the ensign and hed
taken no more than three steps on deck
when a rating came over and hauled
down that repeater they fly to show the
skippers ashore i felt sorry for that
rating having to get up in that heat and
pull a flag down and for what

  for what i asked this guy who
was with me

  what for what he asked me

  that poor guy i told him

when a couple of guys are swap-
ping yarns theres bound to be a little
exaggeration that needs convincing


mammoth adventure

stretched out having a fine time until
his old man showed up makes me glad
im station duty

  what are you talking about he
asked me

  tradition i said tradition in
this mans navy now why should they
haul the repeater up and down all day
just to show the old mans gone for an
ice cream cone or hes playing gin in
the wardroom for what even them
little pcs they got so much tradition
stowed aboard its a wonder it dont
drag em down to the bottom

  youre against traditions he
asked me

  not all of em i said not pay-
day and liberty but you can have the
rest of them what are you making
faces for

  im for em he said all of em
you just for em or you got a rea-
son i asked

  i got the best reason in the world
he said

  im listening i said

  i can see that by the way your ears
is quivering he said im for tradi-
tions because one of em once saved my
life and i know two more guys feel
just the same way for the same reason
convince me i said

  sure he said and he told me a
story

jtor reasons of security he said i
will not identify the exact location
of this action i am about to relate i
will merely indicate that it took place
somewhere between the carolines and
the solomons west of both of them and
at that time deep in jap waters

  we were a little convoy trying to
sneak through to one of our advance
bases we had a few four-stacker de-
stroyers and a light cruiser to protect
maybe twenty freighters i was just
a few weeks out of boot camp and i was

aboard one of those freighters part of
a seven-man gun crew

  the gun we had wouldve sunk our
ship if wed ever got to fire it i fig-
ured wed captured it from the british
in the war of  and it still wasnt
friendly to americans anyway in
those days we didnt have to know
much they taught us only three com-
mands ready aim and abandon
ship it was a rugged life

  it got more rugged pretty fast our
fourth day out just before sundown a
flight of twenty-one jap bombers
spotted us the next thing we knew
they started coming down the con-
voy scattered and it was every ship for
itself the destroyers started zig-zag-
ging and they had the speed to make
it work but this tub i was on could
do maybe seven knots running down-
hill she had an old skipper whod
come back to the sea from some cab-
bage farm and what does this old sea-
dog think he can do he thinks he can
learn new tricks he sees the way the
destroyers are going and he decides to
do a little zig-zaggery himself

  well maybe we should have zagged
when we zigged the next thing we
knew we had two heavy bombs aboard
one took the bow and the other sliced
off the stern and the middle went for
the bottom like an anchor

  wtien i looked around again i was
floating a few hundred yards away
i saw two guys climbing aboard a raft
so i decided to pay them a visit even
though they werent navy but a couple
of deck hands from this freighter i
made it just before dark and there i
was safe in body and mind but very
lonely except for these two guys what
was left of the convoy scattered and
was out of sight before i got to the raft
there wasnt even smoke on the horizon
in an hour if the destroyers came back
later to hunt for survivors they never
convince me i said



came out our way we were orphans
right from the start

  and we stayed orphans we had
some food and water aboard and some
gadgets like fishing tackle and flash-
lights and we figured wed be picked up
pretty soon but we werent picked up
the days went by and the raft went
wherever it wanted to go sometimes
it went so fast it looked like it had an
appointment some place and after the
first week we didnt any of us know
what ocean we were in

  it kept getting worse these two
guys with me hadnt ever shipped out
before and they didnt even know the
sea was salty we ran into some rough
weather one night and most of our food
went overboard because i trusted them
to make the stuff fast and fast was the
way it disappeared what was left
didnt last much longer and then the
water gave out

tt was desperate i mean to say we
had some poles aboard they wanted
to use for oars if they knew where to
go and cared to row five hundred miles
and i used those poles to knock down
an albatross and once we stunned a lit-
tle shark and ate its belly while the
tail was still kicking about every
fourth or fifth night thered be a squall
and wed catch rain water in our shirts
and pour it into the cans we had and
every day that south pacific sun would
rise and bake us crisp before noon and
every night wed shake with chills and
fever

  we had blisters the size of coffee cups
all over our bodies and barnacles started
growing in our beards then the fourth
week we were out we had another blow
and the raft started breaking up and
we kept it together by using our clothes
for line

  the fifth week was the hungriest
and that was when these two guys

started to break up worse than the
raft i hardly got any sleep at first
because i was afraid of the skinny one
he used to look at me all day and ask
me how much i weighed after awhile
i figured i was safe because i didnt
weigh enough any more so i slept a
little until the other one tried to slide
overboard and after that i had to
watch him pretty close

  when the sixth week started i finally
got ready to tell myself i wasnt going
to get saved i might have dived over
myself but i didnt have the strength
to stand up and i didnt like the idea
of just rolling off after that i lost track
of the days and nights and when i
could think a little i tried to figure out
just where we might be just for the
sake of thinking about something i
knew we were finished but i wanted to
know where theyd taught me a little
something about stars in the boy scouts
and id try to work them out but every
time i looked at the big dipper id think
how nice it would be if it was full of
beef stew and it almost drove me crazy

  then came the day we spotted the
sub it was late afternoon and i saw
it laying way off against the horizon
running due south on the surface and
heading towards us at an angle id
learned my lessons and i knew from its
silhouette that it was an american sub
and a big one at that

  the closer it came the crazier we
went we were half blind from the sun
and more than half deaf from the sea
pounding our raft but we were sure
theyd spotted us and we thought wed
heard the guy in the conning tower
yelling at us

  it was that close when it submerged

  thats what it did it submerged
when it was no more than a mile or so
away and that was the last we saw of it
did i say wed gone crazy just seeing
it you can imagine how it was with


mammoth adventure

us when that sub just nosed under and
vanished at first we thought it would
come back that it had ducked under for
a good reason but when it started to get
dark and that sub still hadnt showed
up again we knew what the score was
it hadnt seen or heard us and it had
been close enough to have smelled us

go there it was the end finished

   i lay on my back and looked at the
stars and wondered if i would be alive
the next morning i was crying like a
baby half the time and cursing myself
for having asked for the navy when i
went for induction the rest of the time
the navy i kept yelling the blankety-
blank navy with its blankety-blank sea
and its blankety-blank tradition and
chicory in the java and thirteen buttons
on the pants and piping the admiral
aboard i really spoke my mind that
night what i mean

  and then it hit me-the big idea i
mean why had that sub gone under
why in the blankety-blank-blank had
it picked just that time to go under
there was only one answer i could fig-
ure out it was based on a navy tra-
dition about subs the tradition was
that no sub crossed the equator on the
surface

  you hear that you understand
what im saying i figured that sub had
submerged because of the navy tradi
tion about submerging when it crossed
the equator and that meant that we
were sitting right smack on the equator
i kept looking up at the stars and think-
ing about the equator and suddenly i
let out a yell that was louder than any
nf the yells id let out that day and
some of em had been loud enough to
kill fish in a radius of half a mile

  i figured i knew where we were by
looking at the stars and placing us at
the equator i got on my knees and
shook those two guys with me and

yelled at them until they understood
what i was saying i was telling them
id figured out a group of islands we
were near and i grabbed one of those
poles and used the flat ends for oars
and made them take the others

  and then we rowed i dont know
how fast we rowed but we had a wake
and i dont know how far we rowed but
by morning we saw land we hadnt
had the strength to raise our eyelids
the night before but hope is what did
for us and prayer didnt hinder any i
guess when i said i knew there was
land just ahead they didnt know
enough not to believe me and thats
what saved us

co dont go knocking down tradi-
tion when im around he said to
me theres a bona fide case where
tradition saved three lives

  i shook my head and made a clicking
noise with my teeth and i asked and
it was really land-american land
nah he said it was just a lost
little island nobody cared about but it
had trees and coconuts and birds and
turtles and we lived there six weeks
more before a catalina spotted up and
took us off

  if it was a lost island i said how
did you know about it

  i didnt he said i was crazy i
went so nuts when that sub disappeared
i just couldnt think straight anymore
but i didnt know that i really thought
 could navigate lying on my back on a
raft and reading the stars but if it
hadnt been for that sub id never have
thought of the tradition and id never
have thought we were at the equator
and id never have made them row
wed be fish-food in the fifteenth gen-
eration by now

   but i said if it wasnt for tradi-
tion that sub wouldnt have submerged
and youd have been saved right then
convince me i said



and there without that wild piece of
luck

 nah he said we found out
about that later when we told our
story to naval intelligence they
checked their subs and the place wed
been at and the time we werent any-
where near the equator not any nearer
than two hundred miles

  what i said then what made
that sub submerge just then

  they told us that later he said
after they checked it seems theyd

chief among the legends which originated
about the sea is that of the glamourous
maidens of the briny deep and their male
counterparts the mermaids and mermen these
creatures are prominently featured in prose and
poetry and in the folklore of many lands the
crews of the old sailing ships firmly believed in
their existence

  one of the first experiences a man is supposed
to have had with one of these lovely women of
the seas is told by alexander ab alexandro while
his friend gaza was travelling in the morea a
live mermaid was cast on the shore she looked
very much like her sisters on dry land possessed
a beautiful face and a well-proportioned body-
as far as it went towards the waist the scales
began and instead of legs she had a fishs tail a
great crowd gathered around her so frightening
her that she burst into tears gaza who was a
considerate man remonstrated with the spectators
and requested them to stand to one side as soon
as an opening was made the mermaid scrambled
back to the sea using her fins and tail for locomo-
tion plunging in head first she disappeared from
sight and was never seen again

  from the folklore of sea-faring peoples such
as the danes and the norwegians there are tales
of mermen sea-cows sea-horses sea-dogs and
an entire civilization in the hidden depths of the
ocean

  in one of the early dictionaries jablonskys
universal dictionary the merman is discussed to
great length he is regarded as a real being

  merman is a sea-man a fish found in the seas
and in some rivers in the southern parts of africa
and india in the philippine islands moluccas
brazil north america and europe the length
is eight spans the head oval and the face re-
sembling that of a man it has a high forehead
little eyes a flat nose and a large mouth but no
ears or chin it has two arms which are short
without joints or elbows but with hands or paws
to each of which there are four long fingers con-
nected with each other by a membrane like the

spotted three jap planes way up and
they crash-dived before the planes
could come down to take a poke at the
sub we were so blind and so deaf
we never even knew those jap planes
were around

   i tried to say something but i couldnt
make it

  so dont go knocking tradition to
me he said im the living proof of
the value of tradition got anything to
say now

  you convinced me i said

maidens 

foot of a goose the females have breasts at
which they suckle their young so that the upper
part of their body resembles that of a human
species and the lower part that of a fish they
make a lamentable cry when drawn out of the
water

   in the th century several people claimed to
have set eyes on these elusive creatures of the
sea in  four danes testified before a court
of law that they had seen a merman to them
he appeared to be an old man

   in june of  a french newspaper told of
the experiences of two girls on the island of
noirmoutier off the coast of la vendee they
had been spending the afternoon searching for
shells in the crevices of rocks when they dis-
covered in a kind of natural grotto an animal of
human form leaning on its hands one of the
girls had a long knife within a moment she
had thrust the blade into the animal which uttered
a groan like a human person the two girls cut
off its hands which had fingers and nails as well
as webs between the fingers the surgeon of the
island who went to see it says it was as big as a
full-grown man and that its skin resembled that
of a drowned person the chin was adorned with
a kind of beard formed of fine shells and over
the whole body there were tufts of similar shells
it had the tail of a fish-and at the end of the
tail a projection which resembled feet

   in  a mermaid was exhibited in london
causing much excitement edmund burke the
famous philosopher was among those who went
to see it and he believed in it nevertheless it
was later proved to be a fake made from the
skin of angelshark the exhibitor was punished
for the hoax a clever american exhibited a
similar curiosity not many years ago his was
made up of a monkeys skin sewed on to that
of a seal today there are no living examples
of either mermaid or merman scientists deny
they ever existed and yet the legend lives on

at eight oclock in the	what startling

yorks financial district is pretty much	one old fellow sat up and sleepily

deserted the nations great financial	scratched his head looking around for

   in fact the district was somewhat be-	buildings of assorted sizes and ages

low the end of number one broadway	faced battery park beyond was the

which made it the battery the very	choppy sweep of the harbor some

southernmost end of the stony rock pile	energetic little tugboats scurried up and

on the streets of new york
you see a lot of strange sights
so an indian would seem to be
a natural thing-maybe

mammoth adventure

the indian any undue attention you
see just about anything cockeyed in
manhattan it is said that strangers
travel to new york to study the natives
of that city rather than the other way
around

  also the indian wasnt dressed like
an indian is usually dressed

  he wore plain store variety clothes
he was hatless and his black straight
hair gleamed in the early morning sun-
light he was about the tallest indian
imaginable his skin was the color of
well-cured leather and his eyes were
cold black

  for the past hour the indian had
been making regular trips at exact ten-
minute intervals to the building across
from the east side of the park the
building was still locked and the indian
sat there on the one deserted park
bench a straight ramrod of a figure
and watched the doorway of the de-
lapidated office building

  the structure was in sharp contrast
to the imposing buildings that started
at number one broadway it was
ancient the grandchildren of count-
less generations of pigeons used it for a
nightly roost bronze work on the en-
trance doors was green with age

  finally near nine oclock a man in
overalls unlocked the front doors and
propped them open with a wedge the
fellow disappeared into the cavernous
interior of the place again

  instantly the tall wide-shouldered
indian was on his feet he quickly
crossed the street and sharp black eyes
first searching right and left along the
street he dived into the doorway as if
a coyote was after him

tte found the directory on the
lobby wall there were only six
floors and on two of these were no
tenants listed at all which gives you
some idea of what people thought of the

building address

  obviously the indian could read he
noted the name listed for the fifth floor
it was the only tenant on that floor
the directory said adventurers
inc

  the indian made a satisfied grunting
sound in his throat and turned away
he saw the elevator cage nearby it
was the old-fashioned type v i s i b  e
through open grillwork the man in
overalls sat on a stool inside the cab
reading the morning newspaper

  the indian was just turning away
from the directory when sharp heels
tap-tap-tapped along the marble hall
ancient dusty walls threw back the
sound as though resentful of the intru-
sion

  it was a girl a tall a straight-shoul-
dered girl in a gabardine skirt and
sweater both fitted nicely in the places
where they were supposed to be filled
out

  the girl paused a moment adjusting
her eyes to the dimness inside the lobby
the sudden change from bright sunlight
had left her partially blinded

  the indian saw this he took ad-
vantage of it pressing farther back into
the corridor flat against the wall al-
most as if he were scared to death
about something if the girl had come
directly to the bulletin board she would
have seen him standing rigidly there
instead she moved directly to the ele-
vator and stepped inside

  all right she said impatiently
lets get up to the fifth floor    ad-
venturers incorporated

  its the heat the elevator operator
-he was well over fifty and kindly
mannered-said to the girl makes
people restless and fidgety a pretty
girl like you shouldnt let it get you
i always say-

  please the girl said

  all right all right miss
the crazy indian



  the elevator operator started to close
the gate peered through the diamond-
shaped openings at the indian back
there in the gloom he had seen the
man come in but had not recognized
him as an indian

  where do you want mister he
called out

  the tall black-eyed indian took out
of there as if released by a spring he
streaked toward the front doors

  the girl saw him she stared then
she yelled mike

  pushing past the elevator operator
she dashed into the hallway and started
pursuit mike she called again
mike wait

gunlight struck the coppery red of
her lovely hair as she reached the
sidewalk the indian had just turned
the nearby corner she dashed that
way-and almost collided with a patrol-
man who was just crossing the street

  she clutched the officers arm gave
the arm a shake and said worriedly
catch him hurry

  the patrolman had seen the tall
dark-skinned man turn the corner he
had not noticed that the man was an
indian or a frightened one he was
a young long-legged cop with a good
jaw the jaw pushed forward with de-
termination as he looked at the attrac-
tive red-haired girl

  you bet ill catch him for you
promised the patrolman

  he plunged up broadway his whistle
sounding as he ran his long legs gob-
bled up distance

  the girl saw him turn down a side
street apparently the indian had dis-
appeared in that direction she waited
tapping a foot an uneasiness in her
clear gray-green eyes

  ten minutes passed finally the
lanky patrolman returned he was
breathing hard his face was flushed

  wheres mike the girl demanded

  if you mean that guy i was chasing
for you said the cop grimly hes
gone like the windl my god i
never saw anyone run as fast as him

  dont be silly snapped the red-
head

  the young patrolman rocked back
on his heels he looked at her curiously

  come again he prompted

  i said dont be silly you ought to
be ashamed of yourself a young man
like you

  the cop frowned at her for such
a pretty girl the young woman cer-
tainly had a fiery disposition maybe
the red hair explained it

  mike-the fellow you were chas-
ing she went on is over one hundred
years old and you couldnt catch
him

  that tears it thought the young offi-
cer whacky she was

  now look- he started

  huh repeated the girl you
ought to be ashamed

  she turned abruptly on her heel and
hurried toward the old office building
facing the battery

  the patrolman stood there with his
mouth open staring after her slim
shapely taut figure

  naturally he couldnt see the change
that had come into the redhaired girls
eyes anger had been quickly replaced
by a troubled expression

  damn she murmured to herself
as she swung into the cool shadowy
hallway of the old building and then
again damn

chapter ii

he plane sitting on a ramp at la-
guardia field gleamed like bright
silver in the hot morning sunlight
low-winged sleek it carried two en-
gines and looked as if it were built for


mammoth adventure

unusual speed

  a ground crew fussed around it the
pre-flight check had already been made
yet the five men looked over the ship
again

  the big plane was parked near the
hangar of a private charter air line
well down the huge field it appeared
to be brand new

  inside the plane the fat man-the
sole passenger-sat and fussed also he
was a round man-round chins florid
round face a fringe of gray hair form-
ing a round halo around his otherwise
bald head he mopped perspiration
from his face grunted as he raised up to
stare out the window sat back again
and grunted with displeasure

  forward in the large cabin the door
to the pilots cockpit unlatched and the
tall wiry man in uniform stepped into
the cabin aisle the pilot glanced at
his watch and moved up the aisle to-
ward the fat passenger

  benson should be here he said
dammit yes said the fat man
whats keeping him

  the pilot shrugged his shoulders a
little i cant imagine mr marsh
he told you ten oclock didnt he
yes then i phoned him and
changed it to nine oclock as i told you
a while ago now it is ten and he isnt
here yet i havent all day

  im sorry murmured the tall pilot
a lot that helps a fine way to
handle a buyer for this ship i have to
be in washington this afternoon

  he ought to be here any minute
  hed better

  the fat man was jordon marsh it
was said he had made his millions in the
coffee business in south america then
hed become interested in politics
money had bought him a high political
position in washington he was an
ambitious fat man money got him the
things he wanted his small round

dark sharp eyes told you he was a man
who wouldnt be kept waiting patience
was not one of his virtues

  ill turn on the air-conditioning
said the pilot and he returned to the
cockpit latching the small connecting
door behind him

  in the quiet of the empty cabin jor-
don marsh could hear a faint vague
murmur of voices as the pilot conversed
with the first officer of the flight up
there in the cockpit

  footsteps sounded atop the portable
steps at the rear doorway and a man in
white jumpers entered the plane he
looked like one of the mechanics

  mr marsh he asked

  the fat man jerked his head im-
patiently yes yes he snorted

  it looks like well have to make the
flight without benson it wont make
any difference

  what do you mean it wont make
any difference demanded jordon
marsh

  bensons tied up just phoned the
field office he says to take you up see
how you like the way the ship handles
the pressurization and so on at high al-
titudes then if everything is satisfac-
tory you can close the deal for the plane
afterwards hell be here by the time
we return

  thats a hell of a way to treat a
customer said the fat man

  sorry murmured the mechanic

  the fat man snorted

  the mechanic went to the doorway
said something and the remaining four
members of the ground crew came
aboard they each took a seat

  the boys want to take the flight
too explained the mechanic theyve
never been up in this new job

  without pausing to see if this was
agreeable with jordon marsh or not
the mechanic slammed the door firmly
and turned the latch he went forward
the crazy indian



used a key to open the narrow door to
the pilots compartment closed it be-
hind him

the first motor was started it sput-
tered a bit then settled into a vi-
brant roar the second followed
power pulsed through the entire plane

  shortly they taxied out to the end of
a long runway the pilot made his
checkoff the great engine roar shook
the plane as the powerful motors were
revved up

  noisy commented the fat man
sourly

  one of the ground crew said re-
flection of sound against the earth you
lose that as soon as we get in the air

  jordon marsh grunted

  brakes were released and the plane
edged out onto the runway awaiting
the signal from the tower a moment
passed then they were taking off

  jordon marsh thrilled to the surge of
power that held his huge frame back
against the seat he liked power in
anything

  shortly they were airborne the big
ship climbed smoothly and steadily
the thousands of homes and apart-
ments in queens below them shrank
to matchbox size they headed toward
the lower end of manhattan crossing
the east river

  the air-conditioning had cooled the
interior of the cabin somewhat never-
theless jordon marsh was still perspir-
ing he turned once looking at those
who accompanied him the men were
all silent merely sitting there

  fine company he thought

  he sat gazing out the window as the
ship continued to climb it didnt level
off but kept going higher and higher
they were over new jersey now he
knew the countryside below it wasnt
the first time he had flown

  fifteen minutes passed the earth

became a silent unreal miniature world
far below them twice jordon marsh
frowned as he gazed downward from
the window

  finally he remarked to one of the
men behind him were still heading
west

  thats right agreed the member of
the ground crew

  marsh said the flight is only for a
half hour the orders were to merely
circle over manhattan why are we
going straight west

  guess said the man nearest him

  i dont like this rapped the fat
man and he got up and went toward the
door at the front of the cabin he tried
the door found it latched pounded on
the panel with a huge fist while ae
waited he turned and looked at the
other passengers for the first time
and with some uneasiness he noted
their blocky jaws and hard features it
occurred to him that they did not look
like regular air line personnel

  the cockpit door opened a stranger
stood there in front of him not the head
pilot who had talked to him earlier he
was a thin trim man with cool gray
eyes

  well the stranger said

  what is this demanded jordon
marsh why arent we staying over
new york he leaned over glanced
out a window again were still going
west

  he doesnt like it said one of the
men behind him the fellow gave a
peculiar brittle laugh

  i think suggested the man in the
cockpit doorway youd better get mr
marsh some warmer clothes out of the
cargo compartment it will be quite
cold where were going

  going where asked the fat man
uneasily

  the man merely smiled

  now look-jordonmarsh started


mammoth adventure

and he moved grimly toward the seated
man somebodys going to explain
this and damn quick

  he seized the first man he came to
by the collar yanked him out of the
seat for all his size and fatness
marsh was quick-moving and powerful

a fight got underway in the nar-
row passage the other crew mem-
bers joined in the fat mans huge size
was a disadvantage to them he bowled
men over with his size his hamlike
fists slugged out men cursed

  the man from the cockpit came down
the aisle we cant have this he was
saying coolly a good thing i pre-
pared for this trip here you guys
hold him still what the hells the mat-
ter with you

  marsh struggled with four men at
once even at that he managed to
jerk around and stare at the speaker
he saw the instrument that looked like
a hypodermic needle in the thin trim
mans right hand he saw the mans
intention and tried desperately to break
loose and knock the instrument aside

  but now he was held rigidly his
coat sleeve and shirt beneath were
yanked back and the long needle jabbed
into his arm

  brother said the thin small man
you got a long trip ahead and youll
need some rest itll do you good
everyone started to laugh

  the drowsiness flowed over the fat
man swiftly his knees started to sag
he was lowered into a seat and the
back of the seat was reclined so that
they could stretch him out

  shortly he slept

  one man had been fumbling through
his own pockets he swore next he
searched in the cabin seats after that
he got down on his hands and knees
and peered everywhere

  whats got into you someone

asked

  lost it said the searcher he ap-
peared worried

  lost what pal

  the indian thing

  all eyes swung toward the man who
made the statement someone prodded
you sure

  i aint kidding chum

  everyone started searching the cabin
  they all looked worried

chapter iii

rjphe two men who waited just ouside
the fence that enclosed a walk bor-
dering the airport were an unusual-
looking pair

  one was a short wiry hard-bitten
character with lively bright-blue eyes
his homely face was tanned the color
of oak it was impossible to estimate
his age he could have been thirty or
fifty in turn in his colorful career he
had been a tunnel sandhog construction
worker and prospector there was not
a corner of the world where he had
not sought adventure

  they called him buzz casey and
he was tough

  right now he was muttering the
hell with it rush must have made 
mistake in the time lets shove off
and eat	

  the tall gaunt-looking man standing
beside him frowned with annoyance he
said

  the trouble with you is runt you
got worms rush said to meet jordon
marsh here and were going to meet
him come hell or high water marsh is
big money you dope rush knew him
once in south america it must be
something pretty good or rush
wouldnt chase us out here

  ha said buzz casey

  speak english snapped the tall
man with the gloomy face
the crazy indian



    look said the wiry little man we
  get here see some mechanics tell us
  that new plane is due back here in a few
  minutes see now its an hour and
  no plane  no jordon marsh no noth-
  ing i say the hell with it lets eat
  malcolm dean-better known as the
  deacon-continued to stare at his
  small partner as though the man were
  some kind of worm

    perhaps he suggested it might
  be better if you werent here when
  marsh arrived my god whered you
  buy that race touts sport coat youd
  frighten off any client- and ive got a
  hunch this millionaire marsh is a
  prospect rush said over the phone to
  be sure to meet him here

    this coat cost me ten bucks on sixth
  avenue snorted buzz casey

    youd better not wave it near a
 bull warned his tall partner

    aw shuddup 

    they continued to argue

    clothes were one of the things they
  argued about for the deacon dressed
  as somberly as his nickname implied
  dark suit black tie black hat suited
  his gloomy features no one would
  have ever surmised that he was a naval
  - hero explorer holder of various de-
  crees in science and engineering like
  hi partner buzz casey adventure had
  feaken him to the faroff corners of the
  world

    the two men formed two-thirds of
 the unusual organization known as ad-
 venturers inc

 a nother fifteen minutes passed

    the deacon stood there with his
 long boney hands folded in front of him
 for the past five minutes his thumbs
 had been chasing one another in a twirl-
 ing movement as he kept his hands
 folded

    buzz casey watched the twirling
 thumbs and there was a twinkle in his

lively blue eyes it was the one indica-
tion that the deacon his partner was
getting restless for action you could
always tell when those thumbs started
twirling it paid to watch out he did
the same thing when he was spoiling for
a good fight

  abruptly the deacon moved down
the walk toward a gate there was a
sign that read no admittance to
airfield ignoring it the tall gaunt
man continued on to the field and ap-
proached a nearby hangar some men
were standing there they looked like
mechanics

  buzz casey tagged along behind his
partner

  the deacon was talking to a field at-
tendant when casey cai ght up with
him the man was saying

  frankly they dont know what to
think the plane was due back here
an hour ago theyve tried to contact
it by radio with no results right now
theyre checking emergency landing
fields in this area

  apparently there was something
wrong the field attendants stood
around in little groups talking their
faces grim buzz casey saw his part-
ner slip the man a crisp folded bill

  what else the deacon prodded

  well i really shouldnt- the at-
tendant started he looked at the bill
a funny thing he added

  yes

  no one has been able to check on
the ground crew who serviced that
plane the attendant said frowning
the regular crew was due here on the
field at ten oclock but through some
change in plans the plane took off be-
fore that and this other crew ap-
parently was aboard no one knows
who they were theres going to be
hell to pay

  i should think so said the deacon
solemnly


mammoth adventure

  buzz casey asked hasnt anyone
tried to check the plane in flight

  theyre doing that now said the
man he pocketed the bill said wait
a minute and disappeared toward an
office in the hangar he came back
in a few moments

  i dont understand it he said
tensely the plane was seen passing
high over pittsburgh a twa pilot
bringing a constellation into the field
there saw it said it was flying plenty
high and fast no one has seen it since 

  flying where asked buzz

  west

  the two partners waited another half
hour but there were no further reports
the plane it became apparent had
vanished

  they decided to return to the office
and report to rush randall the third
member of their organization they
rode a cab back to the battery

  the pretty redhaired girl was sitting
there in the outer office in the old build-
ing facing battery park and she looked
as if ready to punch noses

a bout time she exclaimed as
    they entered the room

  time for what said little buzz
casey a pleased grin touching his
homely features as he saw the attractive
redhead

  she had jumped to her feet slim and
pretty her expressive eyes flashing

  i dont see how in the world you
can expect to do business she raced
on heavens coming to work at this
hour

  her gaze swept over buzz then went
to malcolm deans long gloomy-look-
ing figure she said coolly you dont
look like ive heard rush randall looks
like she said it as though she were
disappointed

  the deacon said quietly im not
rush randall maam we are merely

associates of his he politely intro-
duced himself and his partner he
looked puzzled i dont believe i re-
call you-

  the name the redhaired girl said
sharply is williams    lucky wil-
liams ive got a different first name
but i dont like it dont ask me what
it is you just call me lucky like
everyone else does

  she talked rapidly as though she
were all keyed up about something she
added this is certainly a funny-look-
ing office for a business concern hard-
ly a place to sit down either

  buzz said we dont do business in
the usual manner miss were dif-
ferent

  ill say snapped the girl

  her description of the office was an
under-statement to say the least

  the big room was cluttered with an
amazing collection sitting on a wide
windowsill was a dumpy bronze chinese
figure that grinned at them fiendishly
beside this was a beautifully made
model of a three-masted sailing ship in
contrast on the wall nearby hung a
large photograph of a lean tall young
man in a pilots garb standing beside a
fast sleek-looking airplane

  there was a portable diving bell suit-
able for a shallow water diving an as-
sortment of hunting rifles in a wall case
a framed diploma showing that one r
j randall was a graduate of mit
and covering the entire floor an oriental
rug that had not been cleaned in sev-
eral years

  a huge desk was littered with nick-
nacks that must have been gathered in
the four corners of the world books
and circulars were stacked on chairs
there was a sagging old couch with two
colorful indian blankets thrown in a
heap atop it

  the girls eyes swiftly inspected these
things then came to rest again on tall
the crazy indian



malcolm dean i should think youd
have a receptionist ive been waiting
for ages a fine thing 

  buzz casey offered hopefully look
miss maybe we can be of service you
act like youve been chased by a pole-
cat something wrong

  i want to see rush randall thats
what i cant wait forever either
the deacon was moving toward the
rear of the big room he said quietly
rush should be in he opened a
heavy paneled door and continued
through a room beyond

  come on said buzz casey and he
and the girl followed

jphe next room they entered was also
an office none would have ever
suspected its presence in this old rattle-
trap building

  its walls were pine-paneled and from
floor to ceiling there were built-in book-
cases a massive exquisitely hand-
carved desk practically filled the room
the study was deserted

  they passed along a orridor from
which doorways opened into rooms of
a private apartment at the rear of
the hall they entered another office and
the girl was in for another surprise

  for the place was more of a labora-
tory than an office electrical gadgets
were everywhere there was a radio
transmitter and receiving unit of the
type recently used in the armed serv-
ices there was equipment stacked in
a corner and it looked like the type of
stuff carried on expeditions there was
a large desk in this room also before
a wide window that overlooked the
hudson river

  the man seated at the desk had been
phoning he seemed to be completing
the conversation just as they stepped
inside they heard him say all right
keep checking and call me

  he hung up and turned to look at

them seeing the girl he stood up he
got up legs body arms straightening
out into a very tall very straight figure
that was taller than anyones in the
room

  he was blond probably close tc
forty and he appeared to be a person o
very sound muscles he had pale gra y
eyes that searched through one hi
lips were too thin and a little too stern
he looked like a man who did not smile
enough

  the deacon said miss williams
id like you to meet rush randall
he introduced them adding what-
ever it is that is bothering you im
sure he can help you

  the girl said immediately your
outfit helps people who are in trouble
doesnt it she was looking directly
at tall blond rush randall

  that depends he said

  on what

  on whether were interested he
made a slight motion with his hand in-
dicating the other two men those
gentlemen are my partners its true
that we handle cases in various parts of
the world-with certain limitations

  such as the girls tone was again
impatient

  rush randall shrugged his broad
shoulders sometimes we simply take
an assignment because it is in a cor-
ner of the world where weve never
been and which wed like to see or
the job might be mysterious enough to
be fascinating again we take it just
for the sake of adventure

  and sometimes put in homely
little buzz just for the hell of it

  rush randall smiled for the first
time he nodded agreement

  the girl lucky williams said ab-
ruptly well i need help and i think
its in your line ive heard you fel-
lows dont scare easily and i have an
idea this jobs going to be plenty scarey


mammoth adventure

before youre through

  perhaps youd better tell us about
it suggested rush randall

  it starts with the indian blurted
the redhead

  indian

  she jerked her head eyes wide hes
like no other kind of indian youve ever
met they call him mike and hes
from central america or some awful
place hes over a hundred years old
and can run like a deer

  she paused and no one spoke for a
moment

  well she demanded crisply
why dont you go ahead and call me
a liar

chapter iv

jduzz caseys leathery face crin-
kled in a grin youre sure this
indian called mike is a hundred
positive

  she explained uncle clarence
brought him back with him from some
place uncle clarence and the others
they had him on the summer place
down in florida for awhile then they
brought him to new york just recently
uncle clarence said he could prove
that mike was a hundred years old
she bit her lip a moment then rushed
on well a few days ago mike dis-
appeared i was coming here this
morning to see you-she nodded to-
ward rush randall-and i bumped
into mike in the lobby a policeman
tried to catch him for me and he even
outran the young officer so you see
rush randall said quietly so far
miss williams it is rather confused
the girl sighed shook her head
why wouldnt it be she said tensely
im all mixed up too because uncle
clarence has disappeared also thats
why i came to you youve got to
find him for me

  who is uncle clarence asked
rush randall

  clarence hobart certainly youve
heard of him

  the deacons dark eyes flickered and
he glanced at rush

  clarence hobart they all knew was
big money and big time he owned a
chain of large newspapers across the
country he was an influence in wall
street more recently in the past few
years he was also an influence in wash-
ington

  rush had been studying the girl
now he placed her and you he
stated are the young woman who gets
her name in the newspapers from time
to time you were lost once on a solo
flight to alaska half the police and
fliers in canada and alaska were
searching for you another time you
set out in a fifty-foot sloop for florida
and ended up on a reef off one of the
virginia capes

  she nodded eyes flashing

  thats why i came to your organiza-
tion now ajxmt uncle clarence i
mean

  rush made no comment but merely
waited for her to go on

  she said ive caused enough pub-
licity for him the last time he was
furious said it hurt him politically
thats why i dont dare go to the police
and now its him poor dear he must
be in some terrible kind of trouble ive
been frantic worrying about him and
so  so i came here

  you say asked rush calmly
clarence hobart has disappeared
yes and now mikes gone too
mike-thats the indian-was living up
there at uncle clarences apartment
also and now theyre both gone mike
was frightened about something this
morning when i saw him downstairs
if we could find him perhaps he could
tell us
the crazy indian



  mike speaks english

  they taught him the girl ex-
plained

  the deacons gloomy face showed a
little expression he appeared puzzled
who are they he wanted to know

  my uncles associates she moved
a hand impatiently judge english
and jordon marsh-

  marsh

  it was wiry little buzz who gave the
exclamation

phe girl turned her gray-green eyes
querulous you sound like you
were jabbed with a pin do you know
something about him

  i- buzz started and he caught
the imperceptible head shake that rush
quickly gave him he finished ive
heard of him is all pretty important
man isnt he

  the girl nodded expression in her
eyes said that she was not completely
satisfied with his answer

  she turned back to rush i have
plenty of money to pay you neednt
worry and if uncle clarence is in
trouble he has plenty of money to pay
you too

  rush didnt seem interested in that
part of it he asked you say your
uncle and his business associates or
friends-whatever they are-have been
interested in this indian called mike
yes

 why

  i dont know really hes the
craziest indian i ever saw he eats
herbs

  tell us suggested rush randall
just what has happened i mean the
reason you think your uncle has dis-
appeared

  the girl said tensely it was several
days ago i went up to see him he
has an apartment on central park
west but no one was home and i fig-

ured they were out at the time but
now ive been back every day since
no ones there no ones been there
   because ive made inquiries at the
apartment house and now at his office
downtown the office has been closed
no one knows a thing my uncle has
completely vanished

  rush said nothing for a moment then
asked anyone living in that section
of new york employs servants cer-
tainly the servants must know the
whereabouts of your uncle

  but thats the strange part of it
the girl cried there are no servants
theyve disappeared too    the but-
ler chauffeur    everyone

  buzzs homely face brightened
heck he put in maybe your uncle
just up and moved out

  but the girl shook her pretty red
head no she said i had the build-
ing superintendent let me into the
apartment everything is still there
just like it was before the table was
even set for dinner last night nothing
has been changed but    but no-
body is living there

  rush randall decided to accompany
the girl alone to her uncles address
they departed a few moments later
and on the way uptown in his car rush
asked further questions but there was
no slightest clue that the girl could give
him regarding her uncles whereabouts

yt the central park west address
they had no difficulty gaining ad-
mittance to the apartment obviously
the girl had visited here often and was
well known by the building officials
she was given a key and permitted to
take rush upstairs

  rush his eyes missing no single de-
tail went through the richly furnished
rooms and he found that the girl had
told the truth

  everything was in order even to a


mammoth adventure

table already set for a meal

  but there was no clue as to the where-
abouts of wealthy clarence hobart

  an hour later they left the apart-
ment

  back in the car rush asked who
would be the most likely person besides
yourself to know about your uncles
activities

  rush was driving the big closed car
and lucky williams was seated beside
him for a moment she gave him a
thoughtful look then she said judge
english

  judge english

  she nodded continuing yes he
was associated with uncle in politics i
was talking to him just a few days ago
on the phone and he had seen my
uncle he should know about him if
anyone does

  she gave an address near the east
river drive and rush swung the car
in that direction they crossed th
street cut onto the drive and headed
uptown again

  as rush swung the limousine into the
curb he was aware of some kind of
excitement beneath the canopy leading
into the building entrance

  a doorman had hurried out to the
curb was excitedly blowing a whistle
for a cab another building attendant
came running outside followed by a
heavy-set gray-haired man in his fifties

  the girl beside rush exclaimed
thats judge english he seems to be
excited about something 

  the moment their car stopped
lucky williams was out on the side-
walk hurrying toward judge english
evidently the big middle-aged man
knew her for he turned spoke ex-
citedly

  rush arriving behind the girl heard
her gasp no

  she swung toward rush randall
eyes wide with horror as she an-

nounced his son    howard   
is missing i

  then realizing that rush randall
did not even know the young man she
explained howard is a lawyer i know
him well why now that i think of
it he was one of the last persons to
see uncle clarence he mentioned it to
me on the phone yesterday i was
talking to him

  rushs quiet gray eyes went to the
big well-built man he asked whats
this about your son

  judge english drew in his breath
deeply let it out again as if trying to
gain control of his nerves god he
said worriedly i wish i knew just a
few days ago howard was elated about
some new work that clarence hobart
had sent his way i never saw my son
in higher spirits and now    well
hes simply dropped from the face of
the earth we cant locate him any-
where

  work rush asked curiously
what kind of work

  legal stuff i imagine what else
i hadnt had a chance to discuss it with
him it was something confidential for
clarence hobart thats all i know at
the moment

the big man talked his dark eyes
kept blinking nervously rush
wondered if it was an involuntary habit
or merely something brought on by his
wrought up condition

  then judge english was saying
quickly look youre r j randall
arent you ive seen your pictures in
the papers from time to time

  rush nodded

  perhaps you can help would you
mind calling me back in say an hour
he indicated the girl miss williams
can tell you i   

  he seemed visibly upset

  yes rush prompted
the crazy indian



  a man  a man i do not know
just called me he said it was some-
thing about my son howard he
sounded    sort of terrified in a
way hes going to meet me right
away

  rush said if you would like me to
come along  

  judge english shook his head
quickly no that would be dan-
gerous    for howard the man
who phoned warned me to come alone
but ill be back tonight perhaps
then you can help me i hope you
will   

  the last was said pleadingly as the
gray-haired man paused with his foot
on the cab running board

  rush nodded you will hear from
me later he offered

  judge english left then urging the
driver to full speed for a brief mo-
ment rush and the girl stood looking
after the disappearing cab

  then lucky williams touched his
arm said breathlessly i was hoping
   howard might know something
about uncle clarence but now with
him missing  

  she broke off staring at rush ran-
dall she was trembling as she asked
what could have happened to them

  instead of answering he motioned to
his own car said you can wait at our
headquarters until after my interview
with judge english that might be
best

  frowning the girl climbed back into
the car but as they started up she
said but what about uncle clarence
arent you going to try and find him

  that will be taken care of rush
said quietly

  lucky williams appeared upset
about something and she sat there her
hands again knotted in her lap and
from time to time she cast furtive
glances in rush randalls direction

  he had noted these actions he had
also seen something else he said ab-
ruptly you might show me that object
which you have been trying to hide
the girl jumped what    she
started evasively

  rush continued you have been
holding it ever since we left your uncles
apartment

  the girl was on the point of making
another denial but there was some-
thing about the intent grayness of the
mans eyes that caused her to give in

  she opened her hand and held a small
object toward rush

  it was a figurine carved out of finest
mahogany not more than four inches
long an intricate piece of workmanship
it was the tiny figure of an indian

  rushs eyes happened to catch the
girl watching the object rigidly fright
was plain on her pretty features

  he said abruptly why do you fear
it

  the girl gave a start she looked at
him

  fear it she asked i dont un-
derstand

  you seem to be frightened

  i    im not frightened lucky
williams said i never saw it before
in my life it was on the divan in
uncle clarences apartment

  rush was convinced that she was
lying about her fear

chapter v

tater that night alone rush ran-
dall returned to interview judge
english he left the girl at headquar-
ters with his two partners she had
not protested staying there she ap-
peared too frightened to do anything
else

  buzz had reported that there had
been no further reports about the plane
jordon marshs disappearance was still


mammoth adventure

quite a mystery rush was still keep-
ing this part of it from the girl she
did not know hed had an appointment
to meet jordon marsh

  rush left his car parked in a dark
side street walked a block to judge
englishs residence the doorman rec-
ognized the tall blond man having seen
him earlier when he had talked to judge
english at the curb

  you are to go right upstairs the
doorman said

  judge english is at home

  the uniformed man shook his head
he returned sir but he has de-
parted again however he left a mes-
sage for you and you are to go right
up he named the floor and apart-
ment number rush took the elevator

  a butler admitted him to the apart-
ment obviously he had been expecting
rushs visit and recognized him for
he said this was left for you sir
judge english had to leave again im-
mediately but i was to be sure that this
envelope was turned over to you
rush looked at the white envelope
which the butler had picked up from a
table and handed to him he broke the
seal and studied the brief note that was
inside

  the hastily written message read

 i am certain that i have
met the man who knows
what terrible fate has hap-
pened to my son i am going
with him to make positive
that howard is alive any
investigation at this time
might be disastrous wait
five days if i have not re-
turned within that time
please investigate

  rush looked at the butler judge
english wrote this note

yes sir the butler jerked his
head i saw him write it myself sir
 have you any idea whom he met

  no sir

  or where he went

  no sir i have no idea he didnt
say sir

o ush put the message in his pocket
and departed he did not intend
to wait for the five day limit to expire
he decided to investigate immediately

  the doorman of the building recalled
a certain familiar cab that judge eng-
lish had taken he gave the name of
the driver and the address of the com-
pany which owned the string of taxis

  he said that driver is on the stand
here every night sir but he finished
about now he looked at his watch
you ought to be able to catch him as
hes checking in tonight sir he gave
the address of the garage where the cabs
were turned in

  rush arrived there twenty minutes
later he located the driver who had
picked up judge english and was in-
formed that the man had been driven
to a small flying field not far from the
new jersey end of the george washing-
ton bridge

  rush drove out there

  the field except for red marker
lights was in darkness but there was
a small office near the edge of the field
and it was inside the building that he
located the night watchman

  he asked discreet questions

  shortly the man was explaining
why sure they left some time ago

  rush randalls eyes flickered
they

  yep the gray-haired man you
described and three or four other guys
it was these other guys who owned the
plane and they waited until your friend
arrived

  the watchman with gestures de-
scribed a modern-type plane that ob-
viously was equipped for long-distance
flights the plane he said had been
the crazy indian



kept at the field for the past couple of
days no he didnt know the owners
they had merely rented temporary
space at the field

  what was their destination rush
prodded

  the man scratched his beard

  w e  now he murmured i
wouldnt know exactly but they did
a funny thing before taking off they
changed to heavy clothing and i
heard one of them guys say it was going
to be pretty cold where they were go-
ing

  that seemed to be all rush could
learn about judge englishs where-
abouts and so he returned to his lower
manhattan headquarters

tut if rush randall had been in
judge englishs place at that mo-
ment he would have known little fur-
ther

  the gray-haired man was seated in
the cabin of the big plane and the men
were grouped around him as the ship
droned through the night

  one man was saying and so thats
the way it is were taking you to see
your son you will be shown that hes
still alive but we do this only under
one condition

  judge english glared at the speaker
and that is   he prompted

  a hypodermic needle flashed in the
big mans hand the fellow had leath-
ery sunburned skin and a lot of jaw

  he said you take an injection of
this stuff which keeps you asleep until
we get there youll also get a shot on
the return trip its harmless only
thing is you wont have any idea where
youve been taken okay

  how do i know ill ever wake up
again judge english demanded

  the man with the hypodermic needle
grinned

  dont be a chump youre the guy

whos gonna save your son from death
so you dont think wed kill you do
you

  that appeared to be logical and if
judge english was going to see his son
alive it looked like hed have to agree
to the proposition he yanked off his
coat and pulled up his shirt sleeve

  all right he said

  there was only the prick of the long
needle that hurt for a moment then
he was aware of a swift drowsiness
that was flowing over him

  he tried to remain awake to hear
what was being said but all he could
remember at the very las was some-
one saying waitll he wakes up two
days from now

judge english was surprised
when he did wake up he had ex-
perienced doubts just before losing con-
sciousness that he might ever see this
world again

  but he did and it was a strange
world at first-very silent very mys-
terious as though all time had suddenly
stopped and he was the only individual
in the entire universe

  he was lying in a crude swing on
the porch of a large rustic hut of some
sort judge english sat up and rubbed
kinks from his arms and legs he felt
incredibly hungry he stared around
him and all that met the eye in every
direction was deep forest trees grew
everywhere heavily foliaged very
green it was warm and from some-
where overhead the rays of a hot sun
slanted through the trees and cast
grotesque patterns on the earth

  judge english had no idea how long
hed been asleep

  he stood up and walked the length of
the porch it had been well built of
sturdy logs

  he returned to the open front door-
way and yelled hey


mammoth adventure

  immediately someone moved inside
the house a man shortly appeared in
the cabin doorway he was one of the
big fellows who had been aboard the
plane and he was rubbing sleep from
his eyes

  seeing judge english awake he gave
a shout and hurried out onto the porch
soon more of his associates were out
there with him they too looked like
they had been taking some sort of si-
esta half a dozen men gathered
around the gray-haired man

  one though appeared to be the
leader this one had not been on the
plane

  he was a tall well set-up man with
sandy-colored hair he looked very
healthy and very grim

  he said you understand why you
were brought here

  judge english nodded my son dis-
appeared mysteriously why i do not
know but i have been told that he
is here and i have been brought to see
him

  exactly said the leader

  well demanded the judge

  come along

  the tall leader of the group led the
way inside the shack the leader
swung into a room stepped aside as
closely watched judge english was fol-
lowed in by the other men

  the cage extending from floor to
ceiling had been built in the center of
the large room it was made of poles
stout enough to have the strength of
steel bars

tnside the cage sitting on a chair
and looking terrified was a slender
young man with dark hair and some-
what pallid features he had the same
angular strong face of judge english
himself

  he jumped up and cried father

  judge english stood there emotion

plain on his stern face his big form
trembling howard he said then
you are alive

gripping the stout bars howard
english asked tensely did they tell
you about the    the little indian
judge englishs eyes narrowed care-
fully the indian he asked

  before his son could answer two men
grabbed the judge by the arms and
started out of the room with him

  thats what youre gonna learn
about now one guard said

  the others in the room with judge
englishs son waited silently a half
hour passed finally the judge was led
back into the room

  sweat covered the mans features
he was trembling terror was mirrored
in his wildly staring eyes

  his son stared asked what is it
what did you see in there

  but judge english merely shook his
head dazedly he muttered theyre
taking me back to new york ill raise
the hundred thousand dollars then
   then youll be released

  raise the money for what young
english prodded

  but the elderly man merely shook his
head he appeared too terrified to
speak i cant tell you he blurted
he was led out

  but outside the room a trace of cour-
age seemed to return to him judge
english was a solidly built man and he
suddenly whirled on his captors he
roared damn you   

  he was slugged from behind by some-
one with a blackjack

  when he awoke he was in a plane
and the plane was moving he was
tied hand and foot and was in the
cabin of the same ship that had brought
him to the mysterious hideout

  a man stood over him and the fel-
low smiled

he said this will hold you until
the crazy indian



we get to new york

  he had a hypodermic needle in his
hand and now he quickly seized the
judges arm rolled back the sleeve and
jabbed in the long needle

  within seconds the drowsy feeling
was stealing over him he tried to fight
off the heaviness it was hopeless
there was only the droning of the plane
motors and someone talking at another
point in the big cabin and   

  judge english woke up on a park
bench behind the big library at  nd
street and fifth avenue in new york
city it was just shortly after dawn
and there was a cool chill in the air
he felt half starved

  but before doing anything about his
hunger he hurried to a cigar store and
put through a telephone call to rush
randall

chapter vi

tarly that same morning shortly
after receiving the telephone call
from judge randall rush left his office
but first he gave himself an injection
of a peculiar chemical he also left a
message for buzz and deacon stating
that they were to wait in case there
should be any word from jordon marsh
the millionaire

  it had been six days now since the
millionaire politician had vanished

  strangely rush had done nothing-
so far-about the disappearance of
clarence hobart or the judge and his
son the girl lucky williams had
been quite upset about this and she
was so anxious for information that
she had remained at his headquarters
waiting for any news

  she had been given a private room
in their unusual apartment

  lucky williams looking bright and
attractive as a new spring hat was in
the library when some time after rush

randalls departure buzz and deacon
came from their rooms

  deacon was wearing dark somber
clothes as usual but now a fresh
flower was in the lapel of his coat

  buzz yawning as he strolled into the
room looked as if he had slept in his
clothes-much to deacons disgust
but both men brightened at the sight
of the trim pretty-looking redhead

  buzz casey said honey did any-
one ever tell you that youre beautiful
yes the girl said brightly dea-
con did

  deacon laughed thatll hold you
you flat-footed runt

  buzz made a swing at his partner
there threatened to be a fight

  the two men started a loud argu-
ment

  the telephone started ringing

  lucky williams said the phone is
ringing

  she tried to make herself heard above
the racket taking place between buzz
and deacon finally her words pene-
trated the somewhat blue air

  i said the telephone is ringing
little buzz casey leaped to answer
it it was rush calling

  rush announced judge english has
returned to new york

  that was news for hard-bitten little
buzz he had not known where their
partner had gone that morning buzz
repeated the news for those in the room
with him

  rush continued you and deacon
will remain at headquarters try to
pick up any word about the kidnapped
men from any of the airports i might
be gone for several days

  buzz frowned where you going

 i here was a slight pause then
rush randall said judge english
has seen his son but is too terrified to
go on i am replacing him the jour-


mammoth adventure

ney will take several days

  the girl listening heard his words
she seemed startled she moved for-
ward took the phone from buzzs
hand said into the mouthpiece but
what about my uncle

  rush did not reply to the question
darn the girl said stamping her
foot she handed the phone back to
buzz casey

  rush buzz said

  yes

  what about that little indian gadget
the girl found

  that seems to be tied in with the
mystery

  but   

  you will continued rush keep
your eyes open for any further sign of
that omen

  omen buzz was puzzled

  it is an indian superstition said
rush randall investigate anyone
who knows something about that thing
that is quite important also you
might keep a lookout for that crazy
indian mike was apparently fright-
ened away because of it

  you mean asked buzz because
of that omen

  yes

  a moment later rush hung up

  the girl her lovely face tense looked
at the two men she said where is
rush randall going

  buzz shrugged we have no idea
he said

  no we cant even guess said dea-
con looking gloomy

  if they had only known they would
have been convinced that rush ran-
dall had no idea either

either would they have recog-
nized their leader and partner
skin stain and pieces of paraffin in-
serted inside his cheeks had changed
rushs character he now had dark

leathery features and a limp he was
stoop-shouldered he looked like an
old codger who might have spent most
of his life in the maine backwoods

  the instructions for meeting those
who knew about the indian thing men-
ace-turned over to rush by judge
english-had been quite specific rush
was to take the noon ferry from th
street cross to fort lee and enroute
watch for a man on board who would
be wearing a derby and whistling mex-
icale rose he was to follow this per-
son from the ferry on the jersey side
and get into the car which the man in
the derby hat approached

  the contact was made and derby
hat was a big powerful fellow with
sunburned features and wedge-shaped
shoulders there were three other men
waiting in the car on the jersey shore

  rush limping a little and bent over
climbed into the car and the machine
started up and they went away from
there in quite a hurry

  all the individuals in the machine
were browned and husky-looking the
driver seemed to be in charge with-
out turning his head as he sent the car
climbing the long hill up out of town
he said you have the money

  rush speaking with a slight twang
said reckon as i have check

  a check

  yep it will be handed over to you
when i see howard english released
in my custody

  lets see that check someone de-
manded

  rush slowly and painstakingly ex-
tracted a check from a worn billfold
that he carried in his inner pocket
his coat was of a design that had gone
out of style almost a dozen years ago

  the two men seated on either side of
him looked at the check

  one exclaimed what the hell
theres places on that check for two
the crazy indian



signatures    but only judge eng-
lish has signed it

  yep agreed rush still using his
old-codger twang

  whats the idea

  tell you said rush when the
other signature is put on the check
that piece of paper will be honored at
any bank in new york thats judge
englishs agreement

  whose signature someone wanted
to know

  mine said rush randall

  another man commented nobodys
kidding that foxy judge

  i guess not said the driver then
well that plan is okay with us i
think well take this old geezer out
there

  he continued driving at a fairly good
rate of speed

  and some time before one oclock
that afternoon they arrived at the
small private airport in the jersey hills
the big silver plane was waiting on the
field and rush as the old man was
taken aboard a few moments later
the plane took the air circled the field
twice so the pilot could mke certain that
no one had followed and then headed
north

  two men came into the cabin where
doc was seated one said pop you
gotta get a treatment

  treatment

   yeah we re gonna give you a little
shot it wont hurt you any youll
just sleep the rest of the way you see
we aint taking no chances on you find-
ing out where were taking you

  the old fellow seemed to think that
over for a moment

  wal i reckon ill have to take it
he said finally

  they gave rush the kind of an injec-
tion they had administered to judge
english

  soon rush was stretched out limply

on a bunk that had been installed in
place of some of the cabin seats he
snored loudly

  one of the passengers grinned

  wont that old boy be surprised
when he wakes up he said

  i guess so agreed his partner

  rush randall listened to the remarks
and tried to decide whether the plane
was still heading north or not later
if the men should step into the cockpit
he might be able to find out

t first the drug reaction in his
system was terrific for the in-
jection that rush had taken earlier
as an antidote for the hypodermic given
him aboard the plane was now counter-
acting effects of that hypo rush
fought off the strange sleep

  judge english had told him of the
injection which kept him asleep
throughout the journey to the mysteri-
ous hideout so rush randall had
been prepared for the same thing

  he was not asleep now in fact
he was quite wide awake as a result of
one drug trying to overcome the other
in his system it was his splendid phy-
sical condition that finally won out ho
remained awake-though to anyone
who might have closely examined him
he appeared to be a person in deep
slumber

  he listened carefully careful not to
make any movement and after awhile
he was certain that the plane was not
heading north

  men came into the cabin at intervals
they discussed the flight rush lis-
tened   

  a day and a night passed and some
time early in the morning the big ship
came down and landed on the long
stretch of hard-packed sand that
formed a beach bordering a river

  all around the isolated region heavy
foliage was everywhere a dark forest


mammoth adventure

grew to the waters edge excepting
the strip of beach and this forest of
stately trees slowly mounted upward
into mountains that lay beyond

  but the entire thing the green for-
ests the mountains even the cloud-
studded sky was reflected in the flat
smooth water like something done in
oils the air was motionless and warm

  the great silence everywhere was
somewhat breath-taking

  rush randall was removed from the
plane laid down on the beach and a
discussion followed as to just how the
big fellow was to be carried nobody
seemed to relish the job

  while the men were talking about
that a man appeared along the trail
that led out of the deep forest hailed
them and came down the beach to the
plane

  someone said its mort hell tell
us what to do

atort it turned out was a thin
trim man with cool gray eyes it
appeared he had arrived from some
camp located not far from the river

  he said now were not taking this
old guy up to the camp

  rush knew that mort was referring
to himself through slitted lids rush
had obtained one quick glimpse of the
man but he dared not look again
someone might see the movement of
his eyelids

  why not one of the men from the
plane demanded

  because weve moved howard eng-
lish

  moved him

  yeah we think maybe his father
might have figured out something
maybe he guessed the location so
weve sent him up to the passage thats
where youll take this contact man

  you mean someone said in sur-
priseup to the crazy indian

  thats right

  there seemed to be some doubt in
the mens minds about making the trip
to the crazy indian at this time this
was more of a feeling that rush sensed
rather than hearing any actual words
spoken

  howard english continued the
man named mort is at the passage
itll take you about two days weve
got things all ready and waiting for you
so youd better get started

  rush randall listening continued to
assume his sleeping unconscious atti-
tude he had planned a break when
the plane flight was ended but that plan
was swiftly changed now

  for he had an idea now where he
was the plane had not flown north
the comments about the direction the
plane was flying were made simply for
his benefit before they thought he had
been knocked out by the drug they
had wanted him to believe the hideout
was somewhere north

  rush guessed it was south america
they had flown too long to make it
panama or central america though the
country what he had seen of it was
similar

  the thick jungle growth all around
them the odor of tropical foliage the
quiet motionless warmth told him these
things and something else

 the girl had mentioned south
america when she told rush and his
partners about mike the strange-act-
ing indian who was supposed to be
more than a hundred years old and
all three men who had so mysteriously
dropped from sight-jordon marsh
the girls uncle clarence hobart
judge english-all of them according
to the girl had been associated in one
way or another there was her com-
ment about a project the three wealthy
men had been interested in down in
florida somewhere mike the in-
the crazy indian



dian was tied in with that too

  and now judge englishs son how-
ard had been apparently abducted also
where did he fit into the mystery

  well it looked as if rush was going
lo find out they were going to take
him inland from the comments he
heard to the spot where they were hold-
ing howard english where was the
crazy indian and just what was it
they spoke of it as if it were an in-
animate thing odd

  mort was saying you guys will be
met by the chief when you get up
there hes got some other stuff lined
up

  someone whistled

  there were exclamations

  from the undercurrent of tenseness
that rush randall quickly sensed he
knew a reference had been made to the
real brains behind the mystery some-
where in this vast jungle of space was
the solution

  would he live to return to the out-
side again or to get word to his asso-
ciates he wondered if for once he
had carried this thrill for adventure just
a little too far

  they were getting ready to start

chapter vii

jn improvised rack was con-
structed and his big hard-muscled
frame was tied securely to that rush
still pretended deep slumber

  the trek through the forest lasted
several hours the heat was not un-
bearable for the thick green foliage
shut out practically all sunlight and it
was moist and humid in the shadows
beneath the trees there was the heavy
sweet smell of wild orchids growing
atop the tall trees

  they reached another smaller river
he was transferred to a boat it was a
large affair made of stout saplings and

logs there was a cabin of sorts its
walls laced with heavy matlike material
that was was as secure as the bars of
a prison light came through tiny
cracks in the latticed material

  he was placed inside still tied hand
and foot and a door was latched se-
curely the trip continued men poling
the wide flat craft downstream

  another day passed

  rush knew that two men stood guard
outside the cabin he had heard them
talking from time to time mort ob-
viously was taking no chances-though
everyone still believed rush randall to
be under the influence of the sleeping
drug

  night came again and some time
after dark the boat stopped there was
heavy silence for a while and then ac-
tivity began rush listened

  he heard men talking

  someone came into the dark cabin
where he lay motionless on the hard
floor others followed rush chanced
a look before a lamp was lighted

  they were cool gray-eved morts
men but the leader was not with them

  one said i got this thing all figured
out and this is one job we get out of
well make that big fellow carrv this
old guy

  rush was suddenly very alert

  you mean someone asked that
guy they captured along with jordon
marsh

  yeah him hes built like a horse

  then were gonna push through to
the crazy indian without waiting for
the chief

  right someone replied

  men picked up rush randall and
carried him out on deck lanterns
moved in the night and it was cooler
now though the heavy humidity was
everywhere blackness cloaked every-
thing around them

  bring that big bozo aboard some-


mammoth adventure

one said

  rush chanced a slitted glimpse
through his eyelids the darkness cov-
ered his guarded glance he saw that
the raft-like craft was tied up along the
shore

  shortly under guard a tall powerful
dark-skinned figure was led aboard he
wore only tattered trousers and a
ripped dirtied white shirt appearance
of his clothing indicated he must have
put up a magnificent fight before being
subdued

  it struck rush sneaking a glance at
the figure that the fellow would have
looked more natural clad merely in a
loin cloth especially in this wilder-
ness jungle interior

  for he was an indian native

  then the single name flashed through
rush randalls mind mike the
indian the girl had talked about hadnt
someone just referred to the guy who
was captured along with jordon
marsh mike the indian was jor-
don marshs protege why rush still
had to learn

  right now though he saw an oppor-
tunity for an escape while at the time
learning what the mystery was about
the girl had said mike spoke english

  rush wondered why the indian had
been coming to his office that morning
did the fellow know him

tf the tall hard-muscled indian rec-
ognized rush randall he gave no
sign he stood there in the quiet night
his face impassive

  behind him handcuffed to a guard
was a little mousy-looking man with
thin gray hair and jumpy eyes rush
almost opened his eyes wide in amaze-
ment

  clarence hobart the girls uncle
the wealthy owner of a chain of news-
papers

  naturally clarence hobart did not

know rush-at least not now the way
rush was posing as an old codger he
doubted if the newspaper magnet knew
him anyway

  all rush could do was bide his time

  the fussy-looking little newspaper
owner was saying in wonderment my
goodness what are you going to do
with us now

  a man laughed

  were going to take a little hike
pal

  they went ashore

  rush to all appearances still
drugged was picked up and loaded on
the powerful indians massive shoul-
ders he was slung across the big fel-
lows back like a limp sack then the
crooks use a neat trick to assure them-
selves that the indian could make no
dangerous move

  heavy rope was passed around his
waist and the rope bound rush ran-
dalls hands and feet to this also
where the indians hands were support-
ing rushs body they were also tied in
this position thus the indian was tied
to his heavy burden and it would have
been impossible for him to make any
sort of attack against the men who ac-
companied him

  the party set out along a forest trail
that bordered the shore line

  throughout the remainder of that
night using the lanterns the men
trekked through the wilderness at
intervals there were rest stops big
mike was made to lie down with his
heavy burden still tied securely to him
he was watched every moment by two
men who carried guns

  rush randall apparently was still
unconscious

o	ush so far had made no attempt
to escape because there was
something he still sought-location uf
this object referred to as the crazy in-
the crazy indian



dian finding it meant finding howard
english and perhaps the others also
it could be the real hideout or the clue
to the location of the person behind the
mysterious disappearances

  who was he and what was the sig-
nificance of the little carved wooden
images of indians

 the trek kept moving onward
through the night the trail was fairly
well defined the men obviously had
used it before and before them some-
one else had worn a path through the
jungle growth

  the air changed became still cooler
they climbed steadily with the rest
stops more frequent and from time to
time rush saw patches of star-studded
sky sometime before dawn they fol-
lowed a high ridge completely clear of
the jungle now and the blue sky was all
around them there was some wind

  dawn came

  a rest had been called and every-
one seemed to be waiting for something
as it became brighter rush through
narrowed eyelids saw a surveyors
sighting instrument set up on a particu-
lar high point of ground another man
stood by with a notebook in his hand
and he started calling off figures

  everyone was watching and waiting
which gave rush randall the oppor-
tunity to watch also he made a men-
tal note of the readings and comments
he heard that reference to the pass-
age again

  the man at the instrument finally
announced there she is itll take
us about four more hours to reach the
crazy indian

  he gave a few more figures to the
man with the notebook apparently
they were the directions to be followed
until the crazy indian was reached

  just as the party was ready to set
out again a man approached from the
rear he had been trailing the group

was one of the guards himself he
carried some sort of small paper in
his hand

  damn good thing i brought up the
rear he announced he passed the
paper to the leader thin wiry mort
but to the others who were watching
him he said that dropped from in-
side the old guys shirt while he was
being lugged through the forest hes
rush randall

  rush slid from the indians wide
shoulders the ropes seemed to fall away
as though theyd been severed in a
dozen places by a knife and both men
leaped toward their nearest guards

  a wild confused battle followed

at the first hint of trouble two
guards had seized protesting little
clarence hobart and rushed on ahead
with him they were soon out of sight
along a path that dropped sharply
downhill from the high exposed ridge

  the others closed in on rush and
big mike

  mike rumbling with rage and mak-
ing big bear sounds grabbed two men
got his massive arms around them and
started banging their heads together

  rush had already knocked out two
more men with two single blows the
tall blond adventurers speed was
astounding

  the fight moved back and forth
across the high point of ground men
fell knocked down but they got up
again and kept slugging at rush and
the indian

  there were enough figures in the
fight that confusion was too great for
the use of guns

  but one man-he had been carrying
an equipment pack-broke free of the
melee at the beginning and he had now
run off to one side and was frantically
working at the draw-string on his pack

  shortly he had a heavy-looking wea-


mammoth adventure

pon in his hands was busy snapping two
portable parts of it together he in-
serted what looked like a magazine
drum filled with cartridges

  the weapon was a portable machine
gun the man straightened with the
object in his hands and he yelled

  back you guys out of the way

  those who had not been knocked out
fell swiftly away from rush randall
and the giant indian they ran

  the machine gun was pointed toward
rush and big mike

  but even in the split second when the
gunner had yelled to his partners rush
and the indian moved with amazing
speed they carried no guns them-
selves to remain there and face the
machine-gunner would mean certain
death

  and so they plunged down a steep
path that led back the way they had
approached the lookout point the nar-
row path skirted a hump of ground
and it was this that protected them
from being seen

  for the machine gun gobbled and
roared sending chunks of dirt flying
around them but the gunner was ex-
cited his aim was faulty by the
time he got the deadly weapon under
control forcing it downward for better
aim rush and the indian had reached
the protection of the trees downtrail
soon they were completely hidden in
the forest again

  the gun though continued to send
out blasts at intervals it continued to
do so for some time giving the two men
no chance to stalk their captors

  and so since they were unarmed
they continued along the backtrail
through the great silent forest and
about midafternoon of that day they
reached the point where the large flat-
bottomed raft had landed them they
looked for it

  it was gone

chapter viii

rjhere had been little time for talk
during the tense hours of escape
along the backtrail half running half
dog-trotting rush randall had been
hard put to conserve every ounce of his
strength several times they had
stopped at fresh water springs where
rush had flung himself down to gulp
the cool water

  his entire body had been feverish
because of the lack of water and the
effects of the drugs he had been so
long without food however that he did
not feel hungry yet big mike must
have known that he had not eaten
from time to time as they hurried
along the shaded trail the indian had
dodged off into the matted undergrowth
to swiftly return again with fistfuls of
wild berries he had forced them on
rush

  eat  the indian ordered

  the berries had acted as liquid as
well as food they had taken the fever
from his body and soothed his parched
throat

  now the two men sweat-bathed and
panting stood there and stared at the
deserted narrow muddy river that
flowed past them

  mike said abruptly us being in one
hell of a fix boss man

  any other time rush would have
laughed at the comment coming from
the powerful man who looked at this
instant as if he had never set foot from
this tropical wilderness

  the girl lucky williams had been
right about big mike being able to
speak english perhaps now there
would be a solution   

  rush asked quickly mike you
know who i am dont you you tried
to see me in new york

  the tall brown-skinned man nodded

  i euessing last night he told rush
the crazy indian



i keeping piece of glass so us escape
maybe

  rush grinned you do all right
mike

  the glass had been a small bit of
broken bottle which the indian had
managed to hold concealed in his hand
during the trek through the forest un-
der cover of night the indian had
managed to cut one of rushs hands
free then they had taken turns using
the bit of glass sawing through the
ropes freeing themselves

  after that it had merely been a case
of waiting to see what would happen
rush had hoped to learn more about
the mystery but all he had heard was
the information about the crazy in-
dian whatever that was and then he
had been recognized

  he asked now mike what is hid-
den down here why are those wealthy
men being kidnapped

phe indian made a pointing motion
with his hand indicating the trail
they had just covered back there in
hidden valley    my people

  your people

  the indian nodded

  where are we anyway

  amazon mike pointed back
there no white man ever coming
there my people living many years 

  rush suddenly remembered whats
this about you being a hundred vears
old

  again mike nodded secret he
said matter-of-factly secret of hid-
den valley where my people living
mister marsh him coming there   

  jordon marsh

  last year said the indian him
finding hidden valley him taking me
to florida i bringing herbs and mister
marsh and the others are raising in
florida

  suddenly rush was beginning to

piece the thing together a hidden
valley somewhere up the amazon and
natives who lived to be well past a hun-
dred many times in his adventures
to strange corners of the world hed
heard the story hed often wondered
how true it was

  and he recalled that wealthy jordon
marsh had been a plantation owner in
south america hed met the man at
one time marsh obviously had found
the secret valley of the amazon

  but what strange enterprise had jor-
don marsh started with his friends
after they had taken mike here to
florida and later to new york mike
had just stated that he had brought
some of the herbs with him

  did marsh and his associates have
some wild idea about outliving other
men by raising and eating the herbs

  could be men have tried stranger
things

  but the real puzzle was why had
each of the men been kidnapped and
by whom

  he asked mike who kidnapped
you

  the indian shook his head i not
knowing boss man

  where did they grab you

  new york

  rush thought a moment his pale
gray eyes curious

  why did you come to my office
mike and why did you run away
when you saw the girl lucky wil-
liams

  mister marsh one day telling me if
anything happen to him or his friends
to be seeing you right away i going
to mister clarence hobarts house and
finding him gone so i am coming to
you mister hobart always saying i
am not worrying miss lucky williams

  you werent supposed to frighten
her

  the indian nodded


mammoth adventure

  do you know the men who grabbed
you in new york

  not knowing they taking me in
car to new jersey to airport

  rush was puzzled

  more to himself than to the indian
he started to comment damned if i
can understand why-

  he stopped saying that and watched
the indians figure mike was standing
stiffly apparently listening to some-
thing his head half cocked to one side

  rush listened also and he couldnt
hear a thing in the utter silence of the
afternoon

  mike said abruptly we keep mov-
ing we getting away from here they
coming he motioned toward the for-
est trail

  youre positive you hear someone
  mike nodded

  he led the way picking a trail that
followed the river

  rush randall following wondered
if he had ever been in such a predica-
ment it was imperative that he get
word to buzz and deacon in new york
he needed food also he needed equip-
ment if he was going to accomplish any-
thing down here

  he stared bleakly at the wilderness
all around him mike there ahead of
him was the only person in hundreds
of miles who could help him

  he wondered if he could even trust
mike

tt was almost two weeks later that
the message reached rush randalls
office in manhattan tough little buzz
casey and deacon at the moment were
enjoying one of their arguments the
argument centered around attractive
redhaired lucky williams buzz wav-
ing a fist in front of deacons gloomy
face was saying acidly

  the poor girl moved out because of
you thats what waitll rush hears

that shes gone

  deacon glared

  i had nothing to do with it he
snapped she got tired of waiting to
hear from rush she thinks rush isnt
going to do anything about her uncles
disappearance

  buzz strutted up and down the office
he was wearing baggy trousers and an
old turtle-neck sweater

  even if youre right i wouldnt be-
lieve you muttered the homely man

  deacon paid no attention to the re-
mark

  besides he continued even
though she doubts rush is trying to
help her we can still reach her shes
going to be at her apartment and we
can get in touch with her any time we
want

  buzz immediately jumped toward the
phone he turned glared at his tall
partner demanded what was the
phone number

  deacon consulted a small notebook
that he took from his pocket he read
off a number and then as buzz dialed
it added ill talk to her when you are
connected

  the hell you will buzz piped he
swung blocked deacons path as his
partner tried to reach for the phone a
moment later

  a womans voice said hello

  buzz immediately became all smiles
in a sugary voice he said into the
mouthpiece look honey child this is
your big moment    buzz calling
   i wanted to tell you how badly i
feel about that gloomy guy who hangs
around here i mean the way he scared
you out of the place now i was think-
ing   

  with a yell of rage deacon tried to
reach the phone

  but buzz casey still blocked the
way holding the phone in front of him
and moving around so that deacon
the crazy indian



could not reach it

  the voice at the other end of the
line said well listen honey chil you-
all will have to call later

  buzz jumped whats that he
said who is this

  the voice drawled clarabelle an
you-all is callin the wrong big moment
you is talkin to miss williams maid

  deacon behind buzz overheard the
words and the southern drawl as buzz
slammed up the receiver deacon
dropped into a chair and howled with
delight he held his sides

  hello honey chil he said to his
tough little partner

  buzz grabbed the telephone book
flung it deacon ducked

   buzz muttered all right forget it
he looked upset

  anyway he added glumly im
worried about her im at my wits
end

  well agreed deacon you didnt
have far to go

  this time buzz grabbed up tele-
phone stand and all and was ready to
let it fly when the skinny unhealthy-
looking man appeared in the hall door-
way

  the man wore a messengers uniform
hey he yelled loudly i said tele-
gram

he two partners instantly forgot
their argument and swung to face
the messenger deacon seized the en-
velope ripped it open unfolded a
lengthy message buzz tried to read
over his shoulder but he was so short
it was impossible for him to see

  all right he snorted what is
it

  from rush said deacon continu-
ing to read swiftly hey hes some-
where in the amazon valley south
america says were to get a fast plane
equipped for landing on water load

aboard all the equipment we can and
get down there its a river down there
some place

  how in hell we gonna find it 

  rush has directions here he sug-
gests we pick up the girl because he
thinks maybe she can help us find her
uncle

  buzz grinned wow he exclaimed

  also deacon continued were to
try to locate the crazy indian from the
air rush gives us the possible loca-
tion he looked at his partner re-
member those maps we have of south
america were to check one of them
rush was down there once a long time
ago

  buzz demanded how the hell you
gonna find a crazy indian from the
air

  it appears to be a boat of some kind
you dope rush says so here

  ill be damned

  they decided that first they would
tell the girl lucky williams the good
news also deacon put the machinery
in operation for readying a plane for a
flight at different times on special
jobs they used a charter service air
line that was familiar writh their unusual
jobs in various parts of the world dea-
con called the number and ordered the
air line to begin loading the plane he
rattled off the supplies needed other
items he and buzz could pick up here at
the office

  buzz gave the elderly messenger a
dollar and shooed him out of there the
fellow had been standing in the door-
way listening open-mouthed

  deacon still on a phone snapped at
buzz call lucky williams and tell
her were on the way up to see her get
busy you nitwit

  buzz got the same maid again and
gave the information

   a little while later they arrived using
their own car at an exclusive apartment


mammoth adventure

section near riverside drive deacon
wanted buzz to wait in the car but the
smaller man only grinned and followed
him into the ornate lobby of the apart-
ment building

rjhere was a reception clerk and a
switchboard operator both gave
hard-bitten buzz a doubtful regard his
features his clothes were enough to
place him as a roustabout

  so deacon in his smooth way did
the talking he stated that they wished
to see miss williams if she had re-
turned

  the operator called the apartment
waited then spoke to someone she
turned and said yes theres someone
up there you may go right up suite


  they took the elevator

  on the tenth floor buzz pushed on
ahead it had been several days since
they had seen the girl and buzz had
been worried about her his weakness
was pretty girls and he had fallen hard
for the trim redhead

  he rapped on the door waited

  try to act like a gentleman dea-
con advised

  from inside the apartment a voice
called come in

  they opened the door found them-
selves in a small foyer and moved to-
ward what looked like a large living
room beyond the living room was ex-
pensively furnished there were nu-
merous deep armchairs the hall door
slammed behind them

  the men with guns in their hands
rose up from behind the wide chairs
one particularly ugly-looking fellow
said we thought you romeos would
come here sooner or later

  the speaker started shooting

o the amazement of both buzz
and deacon there was no thunder

of gunfire

  the gun simply made a little putt of
a sound and a small object whizzed
past deacons arm

  he suddenly understood

  darts he yelled at buzz and they
went into speedy action

  deacons long fast-moving body
hurtled a chair and he seized one of
the men his fist slashed out the
fellows head snapped back and he fell
down behind the chair he lay there
motionless

  buzz in the meantime and with a
bellow of rage leaped over chair and
all and took hold of the man who had
shot at him there were five assailants
in all the hard little man reached out
and seized another who was trying to
aim a dart gun

  obviously the thugs had decided on
the dart guns in order to avoid too
much noise in the apartment building
the darts were probably poisoned or
contained a knockout drug

  but now with buzz ripping loose in
the midst of the assailants there was
little chance to use the strange weapons
buzz swept up a pair of heavy metal
book ends from a table gripped them
in his fists and started cracking skulls
there were assorted painful yells

  buzz casey was never happier than
when in a good fight at such times he
roared and bellowed he made a lot of
racket and he did a lot of damage

  deacon leaped after a man who was
trying to escape toward the hall door
he reached the fellow and brought him
down with a vase that he had scooped
up from a table

  the man lay still

  buzz was in the midst of three others
who were still on their feet but not
for long

  he hit a man with one of the book
ends then followed through with his
foot the fellow did a flying dive over
the crazy indian



a chair and didnt get up

  another man had reversed the air
gun in his hand was bringing it down
in a smashing drive toward buzzs head
buzz was not quite fast enough to avoid
the blow the steel gun butt struck his
skull

  for a moment leathery-faced buzz
looked dazed then shaking his head
blinking his small bright eyes-he dived
in again he was making a terrific
racket

  outside the apartment someone was
pounding on the door

  a voice yelled behind the panel
hey you guys ive located the
dame she sneaked into the building
next door

tuzz hardly heard another man
went down the last one remain-
ing on his feet suddenly looked scared
to death dived down the long room and
headed for a window that was open
there was a fire escape platform di-
rectly outside the window

  deacon jumped after the man while
buzz bent down to scoop up three of the
dropped air pistols he put them in his
pocket then leaped to help his gaunt
partner

  but the swift-moving deacon had al-
ready clipped the last thug out on his
feet the fellow swayed around in a
crazy circle sagged down across the
window sill

  deacon started to lower him to the
floor he started to say the girl
must have ducked out just before they
broke in here  

  he paused his gaze going out the
window and apparently freezing on
something out there

  buzz demanded what the blazes
you staring at

  in the next moment he stared also

  the tenth floor of this building was
just slightly above the roof level of an

adjacent structure ventilators and
air-shaft chimneys dotted the graveled
roof-top

  the girl had been standing there
looking toward the apartment where
the fight was taking place but now
she turned streaking toward a doorway
that was open atop the roof

  it was lucky williams hatless her
lovely red hair shimmering in the morn-
ing sunlight

qoshamighty buzz yelled
and in the next second had the
sash up and was out on the fire escape
distance to the adjacent building was
only about three feet he leaped

  long-legged deacon was right behind
him

  hey buzz yelled as he took out
across the roof the girl was almost to
the open doorway

  but at his yell she stumbled went to
her knees however she was quickly
on her feet again and running

  behind buzz and deacon a gun
blasted the slug whined across their
heads and a voice bellowed halt in
the name of the law

  both men spun around

  a policeman was sticking his head
out of the open window of the girls
apartment there was a  in his fist

  another cop appeared in a window
adjacent and he started to raise a gun
also

  buzz without waiting shoved dea-
con behind an airshaft projection near
by hell with em he said we
gotta help the girl come on

  deacon paused long enough to scoop
up some small object from the roof
slugs knocked up gravel around his
feet

  ducking low buzz and his partner
reached the door opening through which
the girl had disappeared they plunged
down a flight of iron stairs found them-


mammoth adventure

selves behind a fire door that led to a
top-floor hallway of the apartment
building

  they flung out into the hallway and
saw two sets of elevator doors the
elevators were the self-operating type
and a small glass button next to one
shaft was lighted showing that the car
was in use

  they leaped to the other and deacon
held his finger on the button the
glass above it lighted and they waited
fuming

  buzz said shes in the other car

  must be agreed deacon forget-
ting to argue for once

  it seemed hours until their car ar-
rived and then they were inside push-
ing a button that would take the cage
to the ground floor even as the eleva-
tor started slowly downward they both
heard a commotion in the hallway out-
side

  buzz still pressing the first-floor but-
ton within the car grinned they cant
follow until one of those elevators
is not in use  he said

  deacon jerked his head i hope
not he said thered be a lot of
questioning and we havent got time
for that now 

  they finally reached the ground floor
and raced out into the hallway it was
deserted

  they hurried out to the street drew
up short as they saw police prowl cars
drawn up before the building next to
the one they had just left

  but deacon pointed out nobody in
the cars come on

  they managed to reach their own
machine without seeing any police and
with buzz at the wheel got away from
there

thjzz caseys driving would hardly
be recommended for persons with
weak hearts

  deacon gripped the seat he said
take it easy

  got to find her buzz said

  he went down the block at break-
neck speed they saw no signs of the
girl he took the corner on complain-
ing tires went down a square and
turned in again at the street which par-
alleled the girls

  they found no trace of her

  but buzz determined turned in at
the girls street again just as he did
so a police car left the curb its siren
whining

  buzz flung the steering wheel over
hard started a complete circle in the
street he went up over the curb
missed a lamp-post by inches but they
managed to make the turn and then
buzz sent the car racing away from the
spot

  the siren behind them made wailing
sounds in the morning air but their own
machine was faster soon they had out-
distanced the police car turned numer-
ous corners and were safely away from
the spot

  buzz finally slowed down deacon
let out his breath with relief

  he said well i hope youre satis-
fied

  about what buzz asked

  that girl shes in with those
crooks of course we almost got
caught in that nicely planted trap

  buzz frowned shaking his head
dont believe it he snapped

  all right deacon sighed what
have you got to say about this then

  he held out his hand in it was the
small object that he had picked up on
the roof the thing the girl had dropped
when she stumbled

  it was one of the small wooden min-
iatures containing the carved figure of
an indian

  deacon said grimly every time
someone runs into one of these things
the crazy indian



theres trouble

  for once homely buzz made no com-
ment as they continued downtown to-
ward their office he thought of the girl
perhaps he decided deacon was right

  could the girl be involved with those
behind this unexplainable mystery

chapter ix

the start for south america was de-
layed because of the girls absence
the following morning while buzz
checked final loading of the plane at a
long island airport deacon said

  ill go to her apartment once more
ive called judge english he doesnt
know a thing hes under a doctors
care because of the ordeal hes been
through

did he hear anything further from

rush

  no

  deacon left but it was several hours
before he returned

  no trace of her he announced
no one knows a thing

  buzz gave his lanky partner a skep-
tical look hell he demanded what
about that maid of hers-the one who
answered the phone

  we were sucked in said deacon
  meaning

  there never was a maid thats
something i found out at her apartment
hotel

  but- buzz began

  that was a gag those smart joes
did it to lead us into a trap

  the cops catch up with them
  deacon shook his head gloomily

  it looks he said as if your girl
friend has flown the coop

  they tried to get a message through
to the little village in south america
from which rush randalls wire had
been sent but the telegraph office
would not guarantee that their wire

would get through they sent it any-
way

  late that afternoon they were ready
to take off the airport was on the
south shore of long island and there
was a ramp down which the plane was
eased into the water

  both associates of rush randall
were excellent pilots but deacon took
the controls for the takeoff as he com-
mented you got your mind too much
on that babe

  buzz beside him in the cockpit
snorted shes cute

  too damned cute if you ask me
the argument helped to pass the long
hours as they flew steadily southward
they spelled each other at the controls
the other holding air charts on his lap
or taking a catnap they landed sev-
eral times for fuel

  sometime within the next thirty-six
hours they were over the area described
by rush randall in the message dawn
had just broken they came down to
a thousand feet and closely scanned the
endless green carpet of tropical wilder-
ness beneath them

  a huge carpet that was torn here and
there by a twisting narrow river there
were several of the rivers each sepa-
rated from the other by the impenetra-
ble forests

  it wasnt until they were flying low
that deacon remarked theres moun-
tains down there too id hate like hell
to get lost in this country

  you think this is the river rush
mentioned buzz was busy checking
a chart he had transferred figures
from the telegram to the air map and
was studying them

  if you havent made any mistake in
figuring it is

  they watched for a shack that was
supposed to be located along the shore
that and a sandy strip of beach they
dropped to five hundred feet


mammoth adventure

  then deacon was banking the plane

and circling he lost more altitude

  take it easy pal warned buzz

  i think this is it said deacon

  he watched the river below them
saw the narrow strip of beach alongside
the river saw a rooftop that gleamed
momentarily in the morning sunlight
he looked especially for smoke or any
signs of activity

  then he announced well chum
here we go 

  he circled again throttled back on
the gas and went into the approach
glide he brought the craft down on
the glass-smooth water with scarcely a
ripple taxied toward the beach eyes
alert

  buzz held a gun ready in his fist just
in case

  nothing happened

yhey beached the plane and made
it secure then moved along the
beach

  the morning stillness was almost
startling each carried a gun now each
was wary buzz looked uneasily at the
closely growing matted underbrush

  he said i hope theres no fuzzy-
wuzzies around

  deacon indicated tracks in the sun-
baked sand that was as hard as a ce-
ment floor a plane landed here he
pointed out

  the beach followed the shore for a
good mile midway down its length
they located the big shack almost con-
cealed beneath the trees they still
had seen no signs of life anywhere

  soon they were searching the de-
serted cabin there was evidence that
some of the skimpy furnishings had
been hastily removed

  buzz found his partner standing be-
fore a cracked old mirror on a wall

  admiring yourself again he asked

  look at this said deacon

  there was writing on the mirror
the words read

 follow to crazy indian
according to directions
given you in telegram
watch out for tricks

-rush

  buzz exclaimed then rush was
here

  naturally said deacon this
means he must have gone on ahead
were to follow  if we can locate
that damned crazy indian

  deacon rubbed out the writing with
his hand they returned to the plane
and soon were in the air again theyd
checked the maps and the directions
given in the telegram and saw that
their route was downriver

  what would take hours by slow-mov-
ing river raft was only minutes in the
air soon deacon was convinced that
they had found the area where the craft
had pulled up along the shore they
came down and taxied slowly along the
river eyes watching

  buzz spotted the trail opening into
the heavy forest that looks like it
he pointed out

  they came up to the tiny point of
land and killed the engines buzz
climbed out in knee-deep muddy water
and looked around he saw where a
flat-bottomed boat had landed here
he noted the trail coming down to the
tiny patch of beach he looked for any
further messages from rush randall
but could find none he went back to
the plane

  i wonder where the boat is

  deacon his head stuck out a window
gave the spot a gloomy regard who
knows look wed better tie up down-
stream a bit not right here

te climbed out the plane floats
barely drawing six inches of water
was easy to handle they guided it
the crazy indian

down along the shore until they reached
a curtain of trees that hung veil-like
down over the water like weeping wil-
lows they concealed the plane as best
as possible

  they removed distributor parts from
the engines locked the cabin deacon
carried an equipment case buzz
strapped on a walkie-talkie radio outfit
in his pockets he stuffed some sand-
wiches taken from one of the food cases
that were stored in the plane

  it would have been impossible to fol-
low the forest trail from the air and
rush in his long telegram had said this
trail was important it led to the point
where the readings were to be used for
locating the crazy indian so there was
nothing to do but follow his directions

  they plodded through the deep green
forests the vast silence bothered little
buzz casey dammit he commented
once itd be good to hear an ambu-
lance siren going up broadway some-
thing familiar huh

  deacons long face was more gloomy
than ever you just keep your eyes
open he warned there might be
more guys around here than you think
the blasted woods could be full of
them 

  that gave buzz something to think
about his sharp bright eyes remained
on the alert and he carried a heavy 
ready in his hard fist

  they had switched on the walkie-
talkie just on the chance rush might
be trying to contact them rush though
probably had no equipment with him
they were still uncertain as to just how
he had arrived here it had not been
mentioned in the telegram

  the day wore on

pearly that afternoon they came out
atop the ridge high above the tops
of trees monk found several brass
casings from machine gun bullets and

exclaimed somebody was doing some
shooting 

  this must be the spot all right
said deacon he was removing some
instruments from the equipment case
lets get done and get out of here
before we get a slug 

  which seemed to be a good idea
buzz kept watch while his tall bean-
pole of a partner set up a small port-
able sighting instrument then dea-
took a slip of paper from his pocket
he repeated aloud the readings that had
been sent to them by rush he sighted
the instrument on a spot far off

  he seemed puzzled passing the piece
of paper to buzz he said read those
figures to me

  as buzz read he again checked the
sight finally he said dully hell 
see anything

  only a river and theres plenty of
rivers in this country the crazy in-
dian rush said is a boat it isnt
there he removed one of the air
maps from his pocket and made nota-
tions perhaps we can locate it from
the air theyve probably moved it
at least now we know where its sup-
posed to be

  they started the trek back to the
plane

  buzz cursed the humidity the air
was thickly wet and gave the impres-
sion of coolness beneath the closely
growing tangled trees nevertheless
both men were streaming with perspira-
tion as the afternoon wore on buzz
was stripped down to the waist now
and his sweaty body looked like a
skinny shaft wound with steel bands

  the afternoon was waning when they
reached the river again their first
thought was of the plane if someone
had heard them land this morning   

  but they found the ship secure and
intact they had just completed a
quick inspection when both heard the
mammoth adventure

sound they listened

  it was a gasoline engine and the
engine was on a boat somewhere on the
river for it came down there

  coming this way exclaimed buzz

  they waited

  shortly the boat appeared it was
an old gas boat with a small cabin built
on its deck as the boat approached
they made out the figure of a man at
the wheel buzz yelled before deacon
could stop him regardless the man
had spotted the plane concealed beneath
the trees

  buzz said golly hes an indian 

  this was true

  the man at the wheel was a tall big
man with coppery features and heavy
straight black hair his features were
very sharp and very grim-looking

  they noted these things as the motor
on the boat was silenced and the craft
drifted slowly toward them they
waded out into the water and waited

  the boat was almost up to them now
its bow gently scraped the bottom and
the indian turned and said something
to another person who must have been
in the cabin

  there was some sort of muffled an-
swer and next the girl appeared ab-
ruptly on deck

  they gasped

  the girl as pretty as ever was lucky
williams

chapter x

duzz was excited

    but deacon murmured sourly
trouble i see it coming

  disregarding his remark buzz
scrambled aboard the craft he grasped
the girls slim straight shoulders
gosh he said and then gosh
youre all right huh

  deacon had followed with some mis-
giving

  of course im all right buzz she
said she smiled at deacon she in-
dicated the tall wiry indian this is
joe he has a name a mile long so
i call him joe for short hes one of
the best guides in this country

  joe nodded

  howd you pick him up buzz
wanted to know and howd you get
down here

  she smiled again her eyes were
blue now in the fading sunlight i
flew one of the regular airlines then
chartered a pilot to bring me to that
little village from where rush randall
sent the telegram i picked joe up
there

  it was deacon who asked have you
been able to locate rush or any of the
others yet

  lucky williams shook her head her
lovely eyes clouded im worried
she said tautly

  we go now said joe the guide
deacon looked at the girl instead of
the guide whats he talking about
go where

  he knows of a camp upriver he
told me jordon marsh built it several
years ago he thinks it might be the
best place to start the search

  deacon thought that over a moment
all right he agreed well use the
plane

  but the guide shook his head place
we go river too narrow he said with-
out expression only go by boat
deacon frowned looking at the girl
can this guy be trusted

  absolutely she said quickly

  the tall lanky man shrugged well
i guess we cant be any worse off
obtaining some additional food sup-
plies from the plane they set out

  the river grew narrower the for-
ests closed in around them as dusk
neared the solitude was tremendous
only disturbed by the steady throb of
the crazy indian

the boat engine which echoed far up
and down the inland waterway

  it was dark when the guide put the
craft into shore again deacon held a
powerful flashlight all saw the float
made of heavy logs and which served
as a landing point the raft was an-
chored to the shore line by heavy chains

  they went ashore

guzz was particularly solicitous
about the girl but she was first off
the boat first to have a small pack sack
up on her shoulders

  she said impatiently well have to
hurry joe told me the camp is a mile
from here

  they had brought additional lanterns
as part of their equipment deacon
had had little to say to the girl

  however as far as buzz casey was
concerned she was tops she had ex-
plained to his satisfaction why she had
so abruptly disappeared from new
york

  joe the guide saying nothing his
jaws occasionally working on a wad of
tobacco led the way through the woods

  everywhere there was the vast
strange silence as though the whole
world were waiting for something to
happen in the next moment it was
uncanny what menace lay ahead in
the deep interior of this vast country

  this feeling grew upon them as they
plodded beneath the trees the spongy
slightly damp ground muffled their
steps and about the only sound was
when they spoke to one another

  buzz said abruptly i was just think-
ing

  tall deacon was behind his partner
the girl between them as they walked
single file

  deacon said sourly dont flatter
yourself

  disregarding the comment buzz
went on i was thinking what a heck

of a spot wed be in if this guide walked
out on us he waved his arm indicat-
ing the impenetrable forest that com-
pletely surrounded them

  shut up  said deacon

  the girl gave a soft laugh buzz
she said youre worrying needlessly
joe is dependable hes a wonderful
guide

  i hope so said buzz

  they abruptly emerged in a large
clearing and there before them was the
camp

  whoever had built the cabin should
have been given credit it was well-
made heavy logs forming its sides

  the girl pointed ahead and ex-
claimed theres someone herel
theres a light

  they all hurried forward toward the
doorway of the building but suddenly
the guide spoke in a voice that was
more of a soft hiss than anything else

  you wait he said

  buzz gave the indian one of his bel-
ligerent looks wait for what he
demanded

  the guide had turned was motion-
ing for the others to crouch down he
pointed behind them toward the heavy
woods from which theyd barely
emerged

  look he said very quietly

  they all stared

  buzz impatient as always started to
mutter what the blazes   

  then he paused his small eyes blink-
ing all of them saw now as their eyes
concentrated on the darkness beyond
them

  dark forms were moving out from
the trees those near the cabin were
being surrounded

  the moving forms were men

hphe guide made a deep sound that
  sounded like a grunt

  trap he announced
u

mammoth adventure

  buzz shot a look in the general direc-
tion where the guide was also crouched
down in the darkness yeah he
agreed and heap big

  they could perceive several dark
forms advancing swiftly across the
clearing

  deacon was the first to act he
leaped to the door of the cabin pushed
the girl inside

  keep out of sight he ordered
theres going to be a little trouble
im afraid

  buzz had dropped his pack was ad-
vancing across the clearing his bright
small eyes gleamed and his fists knotted

  ill say theres gonna be trouble
he yelled

  he was first to meet the circle of
advancing assailants deacon and the
guide were quickly at his side

  fists swung men yelled in a strange
tongue bones cracked

  there was enough night light in the
clearing around the cabin to show the
moving of figures buzz banged his
way through several of them they
were dark-skinned natives they be-
came confused

  buzz was shouting now making a
racket he grinned every time a figure
went down beneath his flailing fists
deacon was busy with his fists too
trying to handle a couple of natives at
once the natives appeared to be un-
armed so the two partners hesitated
at using guns

  joe the guide seemed to be doing his
share of fighting

  deacon seeing his small partners
predicament worked out a little system
he picked up a man whirled around
and around with him until the fellow
was dizzy

gering backward like a drunk looking
for a place to light

  buzz was waiting he held his 
by the barrel he tapped the dazed
native with the gun butt as the fellow
staggered past him

  they tried the same method with
another victim it worked

  three men leaped on scrappy buzz
casey-and this time deacon hit buzz
with a gun it was a mistake a result
of the confusion but that didnt help
buzz casey

  he fell flat on his face   

  when buzz swayed to his feet he was
aware that the fight had worked its way
around to the rear of the cabin there
was some commotion back there and
so he leaped that way

  but it wasnt a fight it was deacon
yelling worriedly the attackers seemed
to have disappeared

  buzz glared at his lanky partner

  where are they he demanded

 deacon waved toward the deep
woods they took out for the wild
spaces he announced and now were
in one sweet mess those birds grabbed
joe our guide

  buzz stared

  you mean hes gone

  his partner nodded

  suddenly buzz yelled poor lucky
she must be scared to death he
leaped toward the rear door of the
cabin

  a moment later he appeared outside
again his eyes goggled

  goshamighty  he yelled

  whats wrong with you now dea-
con demanded

  those fuzzies have got her too

chapter xi

then setting him upon his feet	a tense moment following his

again deacon sent a single hay- partners announcement deacon
maker to the jaw the man went stag- said nothing for once buzz was not
the crazy indian



joking

  around them there was the dark
deep solitude of the forest more omi-
nous than ever nothing stirred

  buzz finally said bet you those guys
figured the girl knows something thats
why she was seized

  deacons features were grim has
it occurred to you he demanded that
she might have arranged this trap

  apparently it had not for buzz
looked surprised at mention of the idea

  dont believe it he exploded

  deacon said shes in trouble her
uncle clarence hobart is also in some
sort of trouble as are the others where
are they whats happened to them
he spread his hands hopelessly it
looks like some menace threatens that
entire crowd

  buzz still didnt look convinced aft-
er some arguing it was decided finally
that perhaps theyd better try and trail
the girl she might be in danger

  they spent a few moments locating
things that had been lost in the fight
finally they got started

  the beginning of the trail led along
a fairly well-defined path through the
big woods men-or possibly animals
-had made the trail it skirted the
thicker undergrowth walking was not
too difficult

  they continued onward for about an
hour they found no signs of the girl
or of the guide or of anyone else for
that matter

  the trail had narrowed now was
nothing more than a narrow pathway
they came to a fork

  since the left branch of the fork
seemed to be the main route they fol-
lowed this naturally they first searched
for footprints but a heavy carpet of
old leaves that lay on the ground gave
no clues

  they continued

  and there were more forks in the

skimpy trail beneath the dense trees
and at each of these points the two men
stopped and argued argued about
which trail to follow

  for another hour they kept boring
deeper into the heavy forest

  finally buzz drew up short and said
i think we took the wrong turn at that
last fork better go back he pointed
ahead there was nothing but a wall
of trees now i think we made a mis-
take

  they returned watching for the last
fork where they had turned off and
they discovered a startling fact

  going in the opposite direction
things were reversed they came to
forks in the trail that could lead in other
directions they tried one discovered
that the pathway ended against a
snarled mass of undergrowth they
returned again-to find that they had
somehow missed the trail theyd been
on

  buzz blinked his eyes what the
blazes  he said

  deacon frowned i could have sworn
this was the right path

  ill tell you what i think buzz
said were lost

  deacon nodded i rather figured
that an hour ago he admitted

  and then as an afterthought buzz
exclaimed daggonit i wonder if rush
is lost too

tf rush randall was lost his
movements at dawn the following
morning did not indicate the fact

  with big mike the indian at his
side rush seemed to be following some-
thing or somebody the two men moved
silently along the forest trail not hur-
rying pausing from time to time in
order to listen for some sound that
might come from ahead

  rush asked youre sure were not
mistaken mike


mammoth adventure

  the big fellow shook his head not
being long now boss man missy
lucky williams and man not far
ahead

  for sometime rush had seen no sign
indicating the presence of the other
two people along the trail yet mike
had insisted they were not far away

  you seeing he said

  and a few moments later he proved
that he was right

  sunlight showed through the tall
trees just ahead and almost in the same
moment rush saw water it looked
like they were approaching a river

  leading the way quietly mike moved
closer to the clearing that led down to
the water suddenly he paused mo-
tioning rush to a position behind a big
tree trunk

  they watched

  the indian guide had obtained a boat
from somewhere along shore quickly
he had the craft in the water and then
he and the girl were aboard each
handled a paddle

  the canoe slid out into the water and
headed downstream

  rush said follow them we can
keep to the trees along shore

  they set out their movements silent

  the canoe made good time it was
necessary for rush and big mike to
run at the same time keeping them-
selves concealed along the shore line
this was somewhat difficult

  the river was narrow and made a
considerable number of bends in its
course it was around one of these
bends that the canoe had disappeared
now and when rush and his friend
again caught sight of it-they stopped
short

  for rush saw the amphibian plane
drawn up close to the shore practically
concealed from the river by low-hang-
ing tree branches

  mike turned asked others being

here

  rush nodded his features thoughtful

  mike started forward again

  wait rush warned

  and then mike saw the reason for
the warning

  because the girls indian guide had
seen the plane and had now paused
his paddle resting across the gunwales
he said something to the girl

  in the next moment she was slipping
from the forward seat and easing her
slim form into the bottom of the canoe
she lay down and remained out of sight

  the guide picked up his paddle and
looking alert started toward the spot
where the plane was moored near shore
he used his paddle silently making no
splashes as it dipped the smooth water

  the gun being fired by someone
aboard the plane started shattering the
still morning air

d ush immediately swept into
   smooth action

  get to the canoe he ordered mike
take care of the girl

  instantly rush disappeared through
a screen of underbrush that hid him
from the moored plane he made little
sound as he worked his way down close
to shore it would have been unlikely
if anyone aboard the plane would have
heard him anyway so great was the
sound being created by the blasting gun

  the indian guide had at first des-
perately tried to paddle away from the
spot but slugs kicked up water dan-
gerously close to the flimsy craft

  perhaps figuring on drawing the gun-
fire away from the canoe the indian
leaped overboard and started swimming
frantically toward a protecting over-
hang along the river bank the canoe
drifted

  cabin door of the plane was open
firing stopped for just a moment per-
haps the gunman suspected a trick per-
the crazy indian



haps he knew someone was still aboard
the canoe

  he appeared in the cabin doorway
of the plane and raised the gun again

  that was when he was seized by rush
randalls powerful hands there was
a fight

  the gunman was fairly young and
well-built he was dark-featured with
cheeks that were pale for a man found
in this part of the country

  he tried to fling rush from the plane

  and instead found himself held in
a viselike grip as he was thrown back
inside the cabin of the ship the cabin
was crowded with equipment cases and
paraphernalia the man stumbled over
a case-and the gun fell

  his feet whipped out and attempted
to kick the blond whirlwind the fel-
low could have saved his energy

  because rush picked him up pin-
ioned his arms and then held him the
man found himself absolutely helpless
he stared in bewilderment

  rush said quietly it might be a
good idea to learn identities before try-
ing to kill people

  there was a commotion just then
outside the plane

  big mike climbed aboard with his
left hand he gripped the grim-faced
guide in his other was the girl lucky
williams

  the girl took one look at rush and
gasped then she cried someone
aboard this plane was trying to shoot

  she broke off her gray-green eyes
widening she stared in wonderment
at the man held by rush randall

  she stammered howard   
howard english

chapter xii

ttoward english stared at the
girl at rush randall and at big

mike he appeared too stunned to
speak

  finally he blurted i  i thought
you were some of them following me
i    i guess i was pretty scared
that was quite evident said rush
that is why it was necessary to hold
you you might have shot somebody
howard english gave him a grateful
smile

  thanks he murmured

  rush questioned you said you were
escaping from them who

  howard english though he was a
tall very capable-looking man started
trembling

  he stammered i    i  

  were you seized asked rush be-
cause of the miniature indian thing
howard english jumped as though
he might have been struck by someone
terror was now plain in his eyes he
said evasively well    yes  in
a way

  what is it all about

  i   i dont know howard eng-
lish gasped but as the same time his
wild gaze veered to ageless mike it
was a fleeting glance and yet it was
observed by rush

  well then rush said finally all
we do is return to this place where you
were being held and blast out this
crowd

  howard english shook his head

  it wont be as easy as that he said
  why not

  because first youve got to find the
crazy indian thats where they have
the real hideout where they hold all
captives i was being taken there when
i escaped

  and you didnt learn the location
no i was unconscious part of the
time also they have moved the boat
and they were pretty careful about
mentioning definite locations i came
upon this plane and i was investigat-


mammoth adventure

ing

  rush thought howard englishs
story rang true enough in rushs
pocket was a check that had been drawn
by the young mans own father for his
release strangely though rush made
no mention of that fact now or that he
had played the part of the contact man

  he said perhaps the guide here
can help us

  they all looked at the man named
joe whose name the girl had mentioned
he had been listening to the conversa-
tion his lean hard paws working on his
tobacco cud from time to time now he
took time out to spat

  he made a motion with his hand in-
dicating the river maybe i find for
you

  rush turned to big mike how
about this hidden valley where your
people live why not there

 but mike shook his head my
people are being what you call very
timid and peaceful race they are
getting frightened when too many peo-
ple coming they go away

  rush asked you dont think the
boat was taken there

  mike shook his head hidden val-
ley of my people is being inland boss
man no way to going by boat as
large as crazy indian boat is being
some place else

  rush sighed looked at the girl
what do you think

  in turn lucky williams touched
howard englishs arm what about
the others  were they mentioned while
you were being held captive

  yes your uncle    marsh too
  any others queried rush

  im not sure sir

  rush had removed the makeup some-
time after escaping with his friend
mike he realized that howard eng-
lish had immediately recognized him
when he had seized the young men here

on the plane a little while ago it oc-
curred to rush that howard english
had not been too surprised

  well rush said finally all
aboard then well see what we can
learn from the air

o	ush checked the fuel tanks and the
reserve supply of gas there was
still enough gas for many hours in the
air

  it was crowded aboard the plane but
everyone managed to find a spot to sit
down the girl was in the cockpit with
rush randall

  she told him about the camp where
the attack had taken place against buzz
and deacon

  she explained i escaped from there
during the excitement last night i was
afraid but now i think those natives
were merely trying to frighten us
away

  rush made no comment and in the
next few moments he was busy getting
the heavy ship in the air they climbed
for altitude headed back up the river

  everywhere for endless miles was
the forest it looked like wild jungle

  rush said we will first try to lo-
cate my partners

  a half hour later he was setting the
plane down again taxiing up close to
the log landing raft which buzz and the
others had used the night before

  leaving mike in charge of the plane
they had the guide lead the way through
the woods to the camp

  it was deserted they looked around
outside but found nothing rush made
a special examination for any hidden
messages that might have been left for
him

  he found none

  however rush did not seem particu-
larly concerned by his partners ab-
sence he said perhaps we can con-
tact them later from the plane
the crazy indian



  they returned to the plane were soon
in the air again

  the guide joe watched the winding
river below and gave directions

  at no time was it possible to tell
whether the poker-faced guide was try-
ing to be cooperative or not his cop-
pery features continually held a grim
look it was as though he was always
mad about something

  while rush checked the route with
the guide howard english manipulated
dials that controlled the short-wave
sending and receiving apparatus he
knew something about radio he tuned
in on a wave-length suggested by rush
finally he announced i cant pick
up those guys 

 ush himself manipulated the dials

    but he got no response his eyes
were thoughtful

  next he sent the plane in a banking
circle and turned back up the river
they reached the point where the cabin
was located a mile back from shore
from there he flew a course inland
in ever-widening circles

  below them spread the thick tangle
of forest the trees growing so close to-
gether that it was impossible to see the
ground beneath them here and there
they picked up a tiny isolated lake but
the forest itself appeared endless

  rush said if they were down there
they would hear the plane they would
build a fire or give us some kind of
sign

  howard english nodded in other
words theyre not down there

  apparently not said rush

  he turned back to their original
course after instructing young english
keep the radio tuned in

  the big plane gobbled up miles what
would take days of weary travel on the
ground was now covered in a matter
of minutes but one thing was obvious

  the plane was only good as long as
they followed some waterway the in-
terior was nothing but wildly growing
jungle there was little of anything
else

  sometime later they reached another
river the guide indicated that rush
was to swing north and follow it

  they flew perhaps twenty miles-dis-
tances were deceiving to those aboard
the plane due to the vastness of this
great country-and then the guide mo-
tioned to another river that lay below
them

  it was still another of the many wat-
erways that sliced into the interior

  follow the stoney faced guide or-
dered briefly

  and shortly the guide pointed to a
tiny indentation along the shore

  down he said

  rush brought the ship down from
five thousand feet and they all saw the
cove was of a good size a crane
startled took off from the water and
disappeared

  they landed

  howard english said doubtfully
nothing here but more wilderness
what the devil

  but rush indicated something that
was almost hidden beneath trees far
back in the cove only a sharp eye
could have detected the object

  a gas boat young english said

  everyone saw the deserted craft tied
up near shore

  rush nodded looking at their guide
joe

  it was as though rush had inter-
cepted the guides thought for joe said
gruffly we use boat now this thing
no good he indicated the plane

  it was impossible to get too close to
shore due to rocks that appeared just
beneath the surface there was dan-
ger of wrecking the plane

  but part of the plane equipment in-


mammoth adventure

eluded a portable rubber raft this was
inflated and put overboard

  the girl and the indian guide were
first taken ashore by big mike the
trip was perhaps two hundred yards
across the inner curve of the cove

  then mike returned for rush and
howard english rush had anchored
the plane

  they started out for shore

  from the gas boat another hundred
yards off to their right men suddenly-
appeared on deck and started shooting

chapter xiii

t the first staccato sound of gun-
fire rush whipped toward howard
english

  can you swim he asked swiftly

  the young man jerked his head

  then try to get on the far side of
the plane rush advised dive

  rush was an excellent swimmer it
turned out that mike was also they
plunged from the raft howard eng-
lish between them they disappeared
below the surface

  the guns held by the assorted group
of hard-looking men aboard the fifty-
foot gas boat whacked out lead and
spray was knocked up from the water

  but the range was bad for small arms
it was not far a man appeared on
deck with an armful of rifles and these
were put into use

  the gunmen however jumped to one
wrong conclusion they figured that
the three swimming men must be mak-
ing toward shore judging about where
heads would break the surface they
directed the gunfire that way

  the swimmers meanwhile came to
the surface on the far side of the plane

  they worked their way by reaching
up with their hands and still remaining
in the water toward the cabin of the
plane on the far side of the plane

rifles were cracking and there was some
shouting from the gas boat located
across the cove

  obviously the gunmen now sus-
pected the truth-that their prey was
behind the protection offered by the
plane bullets started arriving that
way a couple thumped into the metal
body of the big amphibian

  rush had swung up to a wing and
crouched down had reached over and
opened the cabin door on their side
in a moment they were inside

  howard english stared through a
window look he yelled

  but rush had already seen wait 
he warned

  a small rowboat had set out from
shore in it were half a dozen men
five of them with rifles a sixth rowed
the gunmen kept firing in the direction
of the plane

  english said worriedly i dont see
the girl-or that blasted guide

  rush nodded he was working with
an object that looked like a type of hare
pistol his hands moved swiftly and
he seemed oblivious of the crashing im-
pact of leaden pellets against sides of
the plane

  the guide said rush is probably
hiding with the girl in the woods

  rush had the pistol ready now it
contained a short barrel perhaps an
inch in diameter he stepped near a
doorway he fired a single shot

  there was a loud sound-and then a
peculiar phenomenon took place

  a great black cloud seemed to mush-
room over the cove it spread rapidly
thick and dense and it enveloped ev-
erything within sight-water trees
men

  rush put away the gun motioned
to the others ordered swim for
shore he was already urging them
out of the cabin for the cloud was fast
enclosing the plane and shortly they
the crazy indian



wouldnt be able to see a thing

  howard english understanding
something of the blond adventurers
scheme said well circle and get
aboard that gas boat

  rush nodded

  but how will we see

  stick close to us suggested rush

  they got out onto a wing and then
slipped back into the water the shoot-
ing had stopped now and all around
the cove there was the racket of men
trying to shout directions to one an-
other

  the black curtain however had
them confused

    howard english rush
randalls sense of direction seemed
amazing all around them was the
shouting of the excited gunmen and the
blackness and yet rush pushed through
the water quietly intent on one course
he was very calm mike swam beside
them

  shortly their feet touched bottom and
they were climbing out onto the shore

  they could barely see each other in
the black cloud that had even spread to
shore they circled the shore of the
cove the men out on the water and
aboard the gas boat were still yelling
excited orders to one another

  but abruptly the shouting stopped
there was heavy silence

  careful rush advised leading the
way it might be a trick

  they were keeping to the woods so
naturally their progress was necessarily
slow

  but they finally reached that part of
the inlet near where the gas boat had
been tied up

  rush moved ahead silently every
sense alert the black cloud was like
a heavy fog all around them

  and then from out of the fog loomed
the bulky outlines of the boat rush

had stopped almost at the waters edge
warning the two men with him

  wait here he said very quietly

  he was gone two or three moments
and then his tall figure appeared from
out of the foggy blackness

  whats happened howard eng-
lish wanted to know

  theyve disappeared rush said

  they started a quiet search they
covered the shore line located the point
where the guide and the girl had been
landed

  they met no one heard no further
sounds from the gunmen who had been
aboard the boat it was clear now that
the men scared off must have taken to
the woods what their plans might be
was a question

  rush had been stooped over examin-
ing the ground he had found some-
thing that now held his interest

  he finally said the guide joe en-
tered the woods at this point there
are the imprints of his moccasins

  howard english blinked there is
only one set of prints he pointed out

  the cloud had been slowly lifting it
had raised several feet above the water
now they could see the gas boat
deserted and off to the right they noted
the plane intact

  there was no sign of the gunmen
though or of the girl or of the guide

  rush said there is one other pos-
sibility in regard to the girl

  what would that be queried eng-
lish

  the guide could have been carrying
her there is a chance that they are
in hiding nearby

tt had started to grow dark now

  they had little time to prepare for
the search

  big mike located the rubber raft
some distance up the shore they re-
turned to the plane rush selected


mammoth adventure

certain items from his equipment as
much as they could comfortably carry

  rush tried once more to contact buzz
and deacon there was no reply he
moved a switch that set some kind of
device on the plane they returned to
shore and made a complete search of
the fifty-foot gas boat and found noth-
ing of importance except a number of
five-gallon tin cans containing gas

  it was dark when big mike finally
picked up the trail of the guide and
led the way into the deep forest the
route seemed to be following a fairly
definite course it did not waver

  howard english asked worriedly is
there anything to show that the girl is
still with that fellow

  rush shook his head he was car-
rying a small black device of some kind
in his massive fist it looked not unlike
a voltmeter he had been holding onto
the thing ever since they had left the
cove

  and now unexpectedly the device
started making a small vibrating sound
howard english looked at it then at
rush randall

  if we hurry rush said we can
reach the plane in half an hour

  young english stared youre go-
ing back he asked puzzled

  rush nodded

  it is possible that buzz and deacon
are in more danger than we figured he
said it is obvious that there is a rea-
son for the girl and that guide disap-
pearing

  what do you mean

  there is a second crowd in this mys-
tery what their exact purpose might
be is not yet clear but the danger
from them is just as great as this other
thing it is possible that this second
group are trying to trap buzz and dea-
con

  but the girl- english started

  the girl said rush apparently is

acquainted with one group she is either
working with them or trying to reach
them at the same time she is terri-
fied of the other that would explain
her actions her disappearance from
time to time

  but what about the guide

  he could be working for either
crowd said rush which one we
do not know

  howard english understood then
there is a purpose in their trying to
confuse anyone who is trailing them
he exclaimed one crowd wants to
get us off their tail the other would
just as well kill us as not

  rush nodded

  worried howard english asked
which one

  rush did not answer

  they had been returning through the
forest english was silent awhile ask-
ing no further questions then suddenly
he asked but what about this thing
that you say is installed on the plane
how did you know   

  rush explained indicating the device
which he carried in his hand i turned
on a sensitized alarm gadget before we
left the plane he said it sends out
short-wave pulsations thats what is
making this thing register now

you mean asked english some-
one is trying to get aboard the plane
rush nodded either that  or
buzz and deacon are trying to reach us
on the radio

chapter xiv

pwo men drifted slowly down-cur-
rent on a flat primitive large raft
they were disheveled they had grown
fairly heavy beards they sat there
in the hot sunlight and acted as if they
didnt care whether the raft ever
reached any place or not

  buzz said dully what day is it
the crazy indian



  thursday i think murmured dea-
con

  you sure

  no

  then why the hell say thursday

  shuddup said deacon gloomily

  they continued drifting along

  deacon had long since given up try-
ing to figure out where they were they
had wandered through the tangled for-
est for well over a day they had come
upon this river which one it was they
had no way of knowing hours later
they had located the discarded raft
along shore and so they had set out
downstream knowing not where they
were drifting trusting that they would
spot some familiar landmark seen be-
fore

  the day wore on

  hey said buzz of a sudden

  deacon roused he had been dozing

  eh

  buzz pointed

  the next moment and lanky deacon
was staring

  the white sleek-looking yacht moved
in midstream the river was wide
here and there was a fairly strong cur-
rent the yacht bore down upon them
swiftly someone hailed them

  buzz gave a sigh of relief boy
our troubles are over he stood up
and yelled a greeting

  suddenly there was a crack from the
deck of the fast-approaching yacht
something whined close over the wiry
little mans head he dropped to his
stomach and stared

  men on the yacht were holding guns
now several had rifles all the wea-
pons were aimed in the general direc-
tion of the raft

  the yacht slid smoothly alongside
there was the sound of powerful diesel
engines throbbing instantly men
leaped over the rail landed on the raft
they held clubs in their hands now

  other men covered them with guns
from the deck rail but one of the men
boarding the raft made a mistake he
got too close to buzz casey buzz saw
his chance figuring those above dared
not shoot

  buzz yelled went into action he
leaped into the midst of the men dea-
con immediately joined him

  a terrific fight started taking place

rjhere had been no chance for
monk or his partner to reach their
pack sacks they carried guns in the

packs

  the fight a tight furiously moving
mass swayed back and forth across the
raft the yacht pulled away standing
off as a battle took place

  buzz slugged one fellow dumped him
overboard as though he were an empty
sack he grabbed another he managed
to twist one of the clubs out of the fel-
lows hand he hit the man a single
crack saw him sway crazily buzz
booted him and knocked him into the
river he leaped back into the melee
the club swinging heads cracking

  deacon was trying to hold his own on
the opposite end of the raft

  both partners were so busy fighting
that they had not noticed something
about the raft but deacon got a quick
view now

  ahead the river divided into two
channels where it passed a heavily
wooded island that lay right in mid-
stream the raft was doing a crazy
circle in the river currents swinging to
the left of the island but it was quite
close to shore moving swiftly

  deacon had already eliminated sev-
eral assailants all were in the river
swimming being carried downstream

  three others were picking themselves
up dazedly from the float and looking
somewhat amazed they had figured
capture of the two men was going to be


mammoth adventure

easy

  the three men remaining on their
feet suddenly backed off as buzz and
his partner started a wedge-formed
drive in their direction and then with
wild yells they ran back along the float
and dived into the river they had had
enough

  the yacht meanwhile had held
back its pilot apparently afraid to ven-
ture too close to shore and for good
reason

  abruptly a submerged rock hooked
the forward end of the moving raft
jammed it and suddenly the huge float
swiveled in the swift current and made
a half circle its forward end still
jammed then the raft slammed against
the river bank pushing up beneath low-
hanging branches that hung down al-
most to the water

  someone was shouting from the
yacht still out in midstream a small
boat was being lowered over the side
aid was being sent to those struggling
in the water

  for a moment buzz and deacon
were screened from those remaining on
the yacht the raft was still stuck
against the jamming rocks it was half
hidden beneath the overhanging trees

  buzz yelled wed better hurry

  he was ripping at a draw string on
his pack sack shortly he had one of
the pistols in his fist breaking the gun
open he removed the shells and started
wiping them with his shirt

  deacon located one of the guns in his
sack and started doing likewise

  buzz grumbled hope these blasted
things still work

  they got the guns ready crouched
down near the back of the raft and
waited for the attack that they knew
was soon to come

  but before that happened they heard
the screaming of the girl and the sound
was nerve-wracking

jduzz screened by the branches had
been standing with one of the pis-
tols held ready in his hand

  taking a desperate chance he ran
out along that part of the log raft which
still protruded into the river the small
boat had just returned to the yacht
and it was loaded with men rescued
from the river but on the deck of the
yacht itself another form of activity
was taking place

  there were two men struggling with
someone buzz stared

   it was a girl

  sunlight touching the red-gold of
the girls hair he gasped

  lucky williams

  and she was struggling with men who
held her captive aboard the sleek-look-
ing yacht

  buzz gave a yell he raised the pis-
tol and fired a blast over the yacht

  look out deacon warned

  guns blasted from the yacht lead
sprayed all around them peppered the
leaves of tree branches just above their
heads

  they bellied along the raft reached
the inland bank dived behind protec-
ting trees it was either that-or get
shot

  the siege of the island took place
throughout the remainder of the day
each time one of them ventured out
onto the log float to note what was hap-
pening aboard the yacht there was a
rattle of gunfire and he was forced to
retreat to the island again

  the yacht deisels throbbing as it
held steady against the downriver cur-
rent lay two hundred yards off-shore
the yacht could not come closer than
this because of rocks which surrounded
the shore

  neither did the small boat put out
for the island the raiders were taking
no chances

  darkness finally came and the situa-
the crazy indian



tion was the same there had been no
further sign of the girl on deck nor
had they heard any further cries for
help

  later that night they heard men sud-
denly shouting aboard the yacht it
sounded like there was some kind of
trouble clearly across the water they
could hear men pounding along the
deck shouting

  and then there was the girls cry
again a cry of terror

  buzz out on the raft now with dea-
con squinted his gaze as he tried to
see across the water they could see
the trim outlines of the white yacht

  he said grimly im gonna swim out
there im gonna find out if  

  even as he spoke they saw some-
thing clear the railing of the yacht
there was a brief shrill scream and
then a splash

  silence strained and ominous fol-
lowed

  almost immediately the boats pow-
erful engines swung into a deep throb
and the yacht started moving upstream
its speed was amazing within mo-
ments it was out of sight

  buzz whipped off shirt and shoes
leaped into the river and started swim-
ming he soon disappeared in the sur-
rounding darkness

  deacon waited minutes passed a
half hour

  finally he heard underbrush crack-
ling and then buzz water still dripping
from him appeared from behind him

  worked my way back to shore at the
other end of the island he said he
was still breathing hard from the ex-
ertion of swimming damned current
almost got me he said

  deacon said and the girl-

  buzz held something in his hand
deacon looked at the object in silence

  it was a brightly colored scarf lucky
williams had been wearing the neck-

erchief the last time they had seen her

  buzz his features strained said
quietly i found this    floating in
the river but    but thats all i
found

  the two of them stood there and
they were silent

pinally it was deacon who said
we misjudged lucky williams
shes been a captive of that crowd all
the time she must have tried to es-
cape tonight and rather than be held
by those devils she jumped off the
yacht

  he looked at buzz you dont
think she reached shore

  buzz shook his head his face was
somber

  deacon said weve got to get off
this damned island no telling if those
birds will come back

  buzz nodded but wed better not
try swimming he pointed out well
never make the mainland

  they spent an hour trying to pry the
big log float loose they used the long
poles that had already been on the float
and they located pieces of heavy drift-
wood along the shore using pieces of
the driftwood as fulcrums they pried
the raft slowly off the rocks it finally
came loose and started easing away
from the shore they jumped aboard

  the moon had come up now all
around them was the night white and
bright and in the distance the dark
somber fringes of the forest

  buzz said were in one hell of a
fix now if that yacht comes back

  he still held one of the pistols but
like his partner he realized their
chances were slim if the yacht returned
they would be starkly revealed out
there in the white moonlight

  it was while buzz was worrying
about return of the yacht that they
heard the drone of the airplane both


mammoth adventure

men stared overhead the steady drone
became louder and then they saw the
silver object silhouetted against the
moon-bright sky

  buzz squinted then he gulped in
amazement as the plane swooped rap-
idly toward them and came down out of
the skies

  he howled thats our ship

  ham added rush must have found
it

  the plane had leveled off now was
flying close above the water it zoomed
over them they saw that a cabin
window was open and a man was lean-
ing out of the plane the man was
holding something in his hand

  buzz let out a whoop and jumped to
his feet he started waving his arms

  rush  he yelled its rush 

  rush randall was leaning out of the
cabin window just as the plane
skimmed close over the log raft the
package that he was holding dropped
it landed on the raft the plane lifted
and continued on

  buzz leaped toward the object that
doc had dropped and then he let out
a yell

  wow he cried food

  deacon in the meantime had been
watching the silver ship he said curi-
ously i wonder why rush doesnt
land and   

jie paused his gaze going up the
river behind them buzz followed
his stare

  like a sleek white ghost the yacht
had appeared again it was moving
downstream swiftly heading toward
them

  deacon shouted rush has spotted
that boat thats why he didnt land

look

  they saw the plane start to circle
the yacht it dropped low again

  and then without warning the thing

happened

  a powerful searchlight sprang into
life aboard the yacht its revealing
gleam picked up the silver wings of the
plane

  rush randall must have suspected
a trick he immediately sent the am-
phibian in a steep climb the motors
were a deep roar now he got up to
five hundred feet  a thousand   

  the gun that must have been
mounted on the deck of the yacht
made a barr-o-o-o-om of a sound a
shell exploded high in the air danger-
ously close to the climbing ship

  another followed

 astounded buzz and deacon
watched

  then suddenly the plane stopped its
climb jiggled crazily in the air for a
moment then started a screaming de-
scent toward the shore of the river a
wing dipped and the plane looked like
it was going into a dive

  within seconds the plane had dis-
appeared across the treetops it was
out of sight now

  several moments passed then a red
glare touched the sky

  buzz gasped they crashed

  deacon exclaimed come on weve
got to get ashore weve got to do
something

  he grabbed up the tin box of food
the box was tied with rope he
loosened his belt slid the belt through
the ropes on the tin box fastened his
buckle again

  whether they would be able to out-
swim the river currents or not was a
question

  but they managed to make it

jhe river made a long sweeping
curve near the point where they
dived from the raft ahead there was
a finger of land that jutted out into the
curve of the river it was toward this
the crazy indian



point that the river currents flowed

  they made use of the currents they
managed to reach land about a half
hour later they dragged themselves
up on shore

  for moments they were too ex-
hausted to speak

  but thoughts of rush drove them to
action they started toward the forest
across a bit of beach deacon taking a
line on the point where the plane had
disappeared inland there was still
some red glare in the sky and they
could use this to go by

  just then a tall dark figure detached
itself from the darkness in front of
them and came quickly across the small
open space

  both men drew up short then they
stared

  the fellow was an indian he held
up a hand in caution buzz was al-
ready fumbling inside his shirt for the
pistol he had placed there   

  and the man said i am being mike
i am coming from the plane

  that stopped buzz and deacon
deacon demanded you are the guy
who disappeared in new york you
were with rush randall

  the big powerful fellow nodded
everything being all right boss man
he landing the plane he saying plane
cannot flying again but no one being
hurt so he setting the plane on fire
deacon said smart work he
looked at his partner rush did that
to fool those babies on the yacht
mike the indian was warning them
to silence you being quiet that
boat landing above here we hurry 
where demanded buzz suspi-
ciously

  we going to meet others  

  too late they saw the other figures
the woods were literally full of them
men from the yacht they came from
behind the trees and they held guns in

their hands one man rapped

  just relax chums nobodys going
any place

  it would have been suicide for buzz
to try to use the pistol they were
hopelessly outnumbered

  they were seized but at the last
moment buzz in his customary fashion
started to fight someone hit him with
the stock of a heavy rifle he was hit
solidly across the back of the skull

  the night suddenly became very
black indeed   

hen buzz woke up again he saw
that he was a captive along with
lanky deacon and the big indian mike
he along with the others was tied hand
and foot and lying on the floor of a
room of sorts the room had a pecul-
iar way of seeming to rock beneath his
aching head he wished the aching
would stop then he realized that the
rocking sensation wasnt caused entirely
by his head

  he was in a cabin and the cabin was
located on some kind of boat the
thought hit buzz casey-the yacht

  it was the indian mike who said
so you being awake

  buzz stared around twisting his
head from his flat position on his back

  deacon said unhappily figure your
way out of this mess pal 

  then he turned his attention to big
mike what happened to rush ran-
dall where were you with him
mike explained how he and rush
had met the girl and the guide and
howard english they had been un-
able to locate this yacht the crazy in-
dian so a search had been started for
buzz and deacon then they had
found both and when the deck gun
had been fired at the plane rush had
been forced to crash land some djstance
away the plane had been nicked
mike told them and they had closely


mammoth adventure

escaped death

  then buzz told about the girl and
her apparent death she ducked out
on us he told mike i dont know
why she did that

mike said i thinking her guide may
be one of the crooks he fooling her
deacon asked you mean the guide
deliberately led her to this trap  to
this boat

  yes

  who else is on the boat mike

  i thinking all captives are being
prisoners here he was ready to say
something else when he paused an in-
tent expression coming to his ordinarily
blank features he seemed to be lis-
tening to something

  watching him deacon asked what
is it mike

  the indian didnt seem to hear he
continued to listen intently

  then buzz and deacon both heard
the far off sound it reached them
through the open portholes of the small
cabin

  it was a sound somewhat like a loon
call and yet it was some other kind of
tropical bird deacon could not place
it the faint sound affected mike oddly
he was very tense

  deacon and buzz in their twisted
positions watched him the sound
did not come again

  what was that prodded deacon
still watching the indian

  mike started to say i thinking may-
be my   

  all heard a faint sound outside the
cabin door they forgot everything
else as each watched the door a key
turned in the lock the door started
to open

  and then little buzz casey could
scarcely contain himself

  she was standing there tall slim
straight as beautiful as ever not a
thing wrong with her

  lucky williams

jphe redhaired girl slipped quietly
into the room closed the door be-
hind her looked toward them and made
a motion for silence she hurried across
the small room

  has anyone of you  a knife
she asked softly

  deacon moved his head back
pocket he directed he stared at the
girls face his own showing complete
amazement

  she located the heavy penknife got
the blade open then went to work on
the ropes that held each captive se-
curely and as she hurried she talked
softly and breathlessly

  someone might come down here any
minute she whispered ill tell you
what happened   

  we thought interrupted buzz
you drowned we heard you hit the
water   

  shuddup snapped deacon

  lucky williams continued that
guide joe was working for them he
tricked me and brought me to this
boat but the rest of it  i cant
understand i mean for some reason
they have not made me a captive i
have the freedom of the boat they
havent looked me up like the others
the prisoners are aboard asked
deacon

  she nodded ive heard their names
mentioned

  how about your uncle have you
seen him

  she shook her head hes the only
one they havent talked about but
they keep the cabin doors locked and
theres no way to find out anything i
cant learn a thing my cabins right
down the passageway so i knew when
they brought you aboard a hard
tough man named mort seems to be
their boss i waited until they had all
the crazy indian



gone on deck then i slipped in here
they left the key in the outside of
the door

  buzz grinned honey remind me
to kiss you later youre a wonderful
girl

  deacon groaned

  listen pal he snapped start fig-
uring a way to get off this rat trap
three of us against a boat load of  

   mike on his feet flexing his powerful
legs and arms made a warning hissing
sound climbing to their feet the others
stared at him mike was standing near
the passage door and was intently lis-
tening again

  all heard the commotion above
decks men were moving about some
running there was a yell

  yet big mike seemed to hear some-
thing else there was an expectancy
about him abruptly he turned and
said to them my people are coming
maybe we are escaping come
deacons eyes were sharp he asked
that bird call that sounded like a
loon

  mike nodded signal he said my
people coming

  buzz was rubbing his hands together
he exclaimed

  then what the hell are we waiting
for

teacon however paused long
enough to look worriedly at the
girl he motioned to a double-tiered
bunk in the cabin hide in that upper
berth he suggested otherwise you
might get hurt

  but there was a brightness in her ex-
pressive eyes she shook her head

  not me she exclaimed im
helping out too

  mike had already slipped noiselessly
from the cabin they followed along
the way they managed to locate an ob-
ject that provided them with weapons

  it was a long boat hook which pow-
erful mike snapped into short lengths
as though the object were a matchstick
they each grabbed a length of the solid
wood

  on deck now a loud racket was tak-
ing place

  buzz deacon and the quick-moving
indian arrived on deck via various lad-
ders the girl trailing deacon a weird
sight met their eyes

  dark-skinned half-naked indians
were everywhere they fought with
white men who had apparently been
taken by surprise aboard the yacht
the fight surged from spacious deck
cabin to the wheelhouse and out to the
wide decks again

  the natives carried no weapons
they were all powerfully built fellows
and they merely grabbed the white men
and throttled them until the crooks fell
down they did this in an efficient
strangely silent way which made the
battle the more amazing

  buzz let out a whoop and started
cracking heads he shouted these
joes sure gave us plenty of hell now
we even the score

  oddly some of the white men seemed
to be fighting among themselves and
the dark-skinned natives were grabbing
them indiscriminately buzz did like-
wise

  the deacon spotted rush randalls
tall blond-headed figure just disappear-
ing down a ladder leading below deck
he jumped that way the girl buzz
and mike had not seen rushs quick-
moving figure there was another
white man just ahead of rush deacon
saw and this worried him

  he ran along a passageway saw rush
some distance ahead rush and the
other man had paused near a stateroom
door deacon called out

  rush

  rush turned his pale penetrating


mammoth adventure

gray eyes bleak and then those eyes
lighted as he saw lanky deacon i
guess we were none too soon he said
and you could tell there was relief in
his voice

  ill say exclaimed deacon he
told about the girl releasing them and
of the strange bird call that mike had
heard

  rush indicated the young dark-fea-
tured man with him deacon he
said this is judge englishs son-
howard english

the two men nodded briefly there
was little time for formalities rush
was explaining

  dont ask me how he did it but
somehow mike got word to his people
where that hidden valley is i dont
even kiow those natives who scared
you off from that deserted camp the
other night were mikes people they
were after the others

  ill be damned said deacon
amazed

  they also located this yacht for us
you see they were aware of its move-
ments mike had arranged the ren-
dezvous place here along the shore
then he was captured along with you
and buzz so i met his people we
swam out here under cover of darkness
if it wasnt for them  

  rush moved his broad shoulders

  yeah deacon said grimly

  then he noted the ring of keys held
in rush randalls hand whats up
they were still standing before one of
the cabin doorways

  weve taken care of the one called
mort said rush hes locked him
up in the brig now well take care of
the prisoners we have the room loca-
tions

  he started fitting keys into the door

  when the door was finally opened
the huge fat man stood there he

looked none the worse for his experi-
ence except that he had grown a beard
he sputtered growled and finally bel-
lowed well its about time

  jordon marsh rush said in ex-
planation for deacons benefit then
coolly to the fat man consider your-
self lucky my friend you might have
been dead

  fat jordon marsh still sputtered
why didnt you rescue me in new
york randall i called your office
asked for help   

  rush interrupted quietly if you and
your friends hadnt had such worldly
ideas none of this trouble would have
happened he turned to howard eng-
lish see if he needs anything how-
ard then come along

jphe fat man seemed about ready to
explode then looked at rush ran-
dalls peculiar gray eyes changed his
mind and said nothing

  they continued along the passage
there was some commotion ahead
buzz casey appeared with two subdued
very meek prisoners he grinned when
he saw rush got a place where i
can lock these joes up he asked the
brigs already full

  they found an empty large cabin
rush turned the key over to little buzz
for the tough assistant explained i
got me some more up on deck he
turned added the battles over dam-
mit

  rush had been looking at cabin num-
bers on the doors howard english was
saying theres only the girls uncle
clarence hobart to be accounted for
dads safe in new york and youve
found jordon marsh   

  rush nodded

  young english frowning asked
why was i kidnapped randall in
place of my father who was one of that
partnership
the crazy indian



  rush shrugged because the man
behind this knew your father would
pay off if you disappeared he knew
that your father would pay plenty for
your release also by kidnapping you
it kept your father from knowing too
much 

  you mean asked howard english
it would keep dad from knowing who
the real villian was

  thats right

who is it the young man asked

  youre going to meet him now said
rush and he opened the door beside
which they stood oddly it was not
locked rush had not thought it
would be

hphe man inside jumped up nervously
from the bunk he was a small
alert fussy little man with jumpy eyes
he started to gasp with relief thank
heavens youre here i thought  

  clarence hobart  exclaimed young
howard english

  rush randall said coolly you can
lay off the dramatics hobart youre
washed up

  the fussy little man acted as if he
was going to have a nervous breakdown
rush said harshly cut it

  and clarence hobart stood there
fluttery eyes holding on rush randall
on the strange calculating cool gray
eyes and he became silent

  rush motioned english and deacon
inside the room then he closed the door
he said to the small nervous man
your niece miss williams isnt wise
to you-yet it explains why she wasnt
harmed by mort and his crowd when
she was brought aboard this yacht be-
cause its your hideout and youve been
behind the whole scheme he paused
then added for her sake possibly
theres a way of keeping you out of
prison but by god youd better talk
-and fast

  they waited

  you could see the turmoil taking
place in the small mans mind it was
mirrored on his face and in his jumpy

eyes

  finally he said just what do you
mean randall

  i mean said rush you can make
retribution understand i dont hold
with any of your crowd-you jordon
marsh or judge english he glanced
at young howard murmured sorry
then the three of you were out to
make a killing only you thought you
had a better idea than the rest so you
had them kidnapped all right lets
have the rest of it

  clarence hobart sat down on the
bunk he rubbed his small hands across
his sweaty face suddenly he looked
like an old man he murmured all
right

  the others were silent

  then hobart said jordon marsh
as you know was a coffee plantation
owner in south america some years
ago he stumbled onto this indian
thing he located the hidden valley
where that tribe lives hed heard they
live to be a hundred or more because
of certain herbs that grow there in the
valley and which these indians live
upon one day he took me in on the
secret

  in other words prompted rush
he wanted a little financial backing
hobart nodded judge english and
i joined him we helped buy this yacht
we spent a lot of money coming down
here and finally making friends with
the natives ordinarily theyre a shy
lot it took several trips then we
took mike back to florida

  where you were going to raise the
herbs in a part of the everglades tiie
climate there the moisture duplicated
that found here

  yes
mammoth adventure

 why

tjobart looked up smiled dully

    why does any man want to live
to be a hundred or more think of the
things he can accomplish in life each
of us was active in washington politics
we saw a way to outlive any who op-
posed us and to become the greatest
power group in history we would be-
come famous

  rush said the only trouble with
that kind of power is that it gets you
each of you thought it would be swell
if you could gain complete control of
power and wealth so you started
chiseling   

  jordon marsh did cried little
clarence hobart he bled me for al-
most every cent i had i was going
broke my newspapers are mortgaged
to the hilt

  rush nodded so you hit upon the
scheme of kidnapping them shaking
them down for several hundred thou-
sand and going through with the
scheme yourself right

  slowly the man nodded

  rush sighed well this little ad-
venture has cost me money i have a
plane to pay for-not counting my time
and trouble i can turn this whole
rotten business over to the police and
you three men can pay take your
choice remember theres your niece
to think about

  hobarts low-spoken yes indicated
he was thinking about the girl too

  i think he said softly wed all be
better off forgetting this long-life busi-
ness it has only led to unhappiness
and trouble ill make amends with
you he looked at rush you wont
tell her-lucky

  i think rush said we can tell
her that the tough little man named
mort was behind it who were the
others

hobart explained typical new
york sharpsters who got wind of the
deal from the man i employed one
group was trying to cut in on the other
i thought so said rush

ver the forests there was the
calmness of the vast silent night
 a quiet that extended to the deck
of the motionless yacht

  decks that were now cleared of fight-
ing men only rush randall deacon
and mike the indian now stood there
buzz and howard english were below
seeing that all captives were locked up
in separate cabins or in the brig

  oddly there was not another indian
on deck but out there in the river
dark forms swam toward shore the
figures were fast fading in the moon-
light

  mike said my people returning
they not liking trouble they being
always a peaceful people i returning
too

  he turned to rush and the girl i
thinking it better if white men not com-
ing here any more

  rush nodded mike i want to thank
you and your people for what youve
done no i dont think youll be both-
ered with white mans kind of civiliza-
tion again it isnt very good is it
mike seemed to smile a little he
shook hands with them both then
quickly climbed the rail his power-
ful lean body flashed overside it cut
the water smoothly then he was swim-
ming away

  lucky williams sighed maybe
she murmured he has more sense than
any of us

  maybe agreed rush

  the girl asked rush what was
the meaning of those little carved minia-
tures of indians

nothing r e a  v he explained
mike told me his people used to
the crazy indian



carve them out of mahogany marsh
got hold of some of them and they got
scattered around they were odd
enough to be puzzling

  and said the girl frightening
buzz came on deck there was a
large lump on his forehead and he was
dirty and disheveled but he seemed
as bright as ever

  boy he said chicken found
it in the galley refrigerator he
grabbed the girls arm how about
making some coffee honey lets put
on a feed he glanced at rush join
us

  rush said in a moment in a little
while well have to divide up duties here

ruffian dick
explorer

continued from page 

arabic finally he was sent home from the school
after very carefully attending the forbidden races
under the watchful eyes of the proper authorities

  the next few years were spent in india at
the boys request his father had purchased a
commission for him in the east india companys
private army which still governed india he em-
barked endured the boring days of heat and
stench and monotony on the journey around the
cape and landed in india on the th of october
 ambitious he set about learning the lan-
guages manners customs of the peoples of the
east very unpopular among his fellow officers
he came home on furlough bearing the nickname
that stuck throughout the rest of his life-that
of ruffian dick he had been over-bearing brutal
and unmannerly but what alienated his fellow
countrymen the most was his queer behavior
among the natives in his free time he was al-
ways to be found wandering in the native bazaars
more often than not himself in the garb of a
native unclean and unashamed he had even
been admitted to the native order of mystics as
a master-sufi he was an atheist and very prop-
erly he had been forbidden active service

  at home on a long furlough he responded to
the urge to write and put down his thoughts on
paper several insignificant volumes were pub-
lished it was at this time that he met isabel
arundel who was so greatly to influence his later
life her parents refused to consent to their mar-
riage until richard could prove himself worthy
penniless and disreputable as he was there seemed

on the boat were setting sail as
quickly as possible tell deacon hell
have to navigate

  buzz and the girl met deacon com-
ing along a passage buzz said grin-
ning sorry you cant join us rush
wants to see you about navigating the
ship

  where you going lanky deacon
asked suspiciously

  got a dinner date-with a red-
head beamed buzz casey

  the gloominess dropped from dea-
cons face he joined them you did
have pal he said but three makes
more pleasant company

  that started them arguing again

no chance for him

   setung about to answer that challenge burton
prepared himself to attempt what no other white
man had ever dared to do before    make the
pilgrimage from medina to mecca disguised as a
moslem south arabia was still - though not
entirely-unexplored country from the viewpoint
of the european the real nature of the ceremonies
at the kaaba that focus and shrine of al-islam
were still uncertain

  obtaining a further years furlough burton
descended upon arabia in the form of a persian
moslem staining his skin with walnut juice ac-
companied by a half-witted but devoted moham-
medan servant and bearing the name of mirza
abdullah of bushiri his disguise was complete
in  he landed in alexandria cairo was
reached by river boat after that leg of the
journey he felt reasonably sure of his disguise
the boat to suez was loaded down with pilgrims
burton was the only white man among them by
the time the vessel docked at yambu he had
complete confidence in his venture

  at yambu a camel caravan was formed the
trek into arabia furnished the daring englishman
with his first real taste of thirst and sunglare the
days melted into one another and months passed
before medina was sighted burton won a place
in the hearts of the mohammedans for himself
by using his scant knowledge of medicine to good
advantage by the end of august medina was
reached there caravans arriving from all direc-
tions were formed into one huge concourse and
made ready to march on the holy city

  the march began on the st day of september
and was an uneventful journey of ten days inland
toward the holiest spot in arabia from which
mohammedanism had sprung the closer burton
moved to the revered city of mecca the more

wanted-dead man

ha stood there with the chair poised across his shoulder watching them slug it out


he was a precise little man not
fussy you must understand
but precise exact like when
he cut the steak he ordered at the
howling cat the beanery which cat-
ered to the crows nest crew of which
i was a member

  he had walked in a small man in a
well-worn though neatly pressed dark
suit and with quick quiet movements
went to the hall tree and deposited on it
the derby hat which was part of his
costume then turning he surveyed
the gang at their dinner hour i saw
him clear his throat as though he had
intentions of saying something but if

  he had intended that he changed his
  mind deliberately he looked about
  and though there were several vacant
  stools he chose the one next to mine

    ah miss he stopped jenny the
  only slinger the beanery boasted he
  lifted a cautioning finger the other fin-
  gers curling delicately toward his palm

    his voice high and slightly nasal
  brought attention to our end of the
  counter jenny stopped as though her
  feet had hit a glue puddle she turned
  wide protruding eyes on him

    yaas her husky voice asked

    i would like very much to have a
  steak the little man said a t-bone

they say it takes big men to
make a big fight but this little
man didnt see it quite that way
so there was only one thing to do


mammoth adventure

steak you may tell the chef that i
would appreciate him broiling the steak
for a period not to exceed five minutes
at the end of which time he will find
that the steak will be done to my taste
that is if the flames are not too high a
temperature of approximately eight
hundred degrees would be about right
jennie had a row of orders slung down
the length of her arm the wide grey-
ish-blue eyes went even wider the full
pouting lips pouted a little fuller and
the high rounded bosom an attraction
which we found irresistible heaved into
more delicious roundness this was
something new in jennies life

  just sit there mister jennie said
dont go away ill be right back
the stranger turned slightly puzzled
eyes to me as jennie continued on her
way to her customers

  dont go away he said more to
himself than to me but where could
i go in this benighted town

  well i said more to make con-
versation than for any other reason
you can go to the rattery

 the rattery whats that he
asked

  another joint only more so than
this i replied

  he had peculiar eyes i noticed
where the skin on the rest of his face
was set flush to the bone structure so
that it looked as if someone had knotted
it tightly at the back of his neck his
eyes lay buried in folds of leaden skin
behind which peeped the palest blue
orbs id ever seen they looked like a
pair of fleshy icicles

  unless im greatly mistaken he
said there is under that gloomy ex-
terior an intelligent being at any rate
ill chance it can you tell me    

yre looked away at the same
time jennie had come back she
stood looking down at the little stranger

as if he were a being from another
world he probably was too dead-
end gulch was not the most cosmopoli-
tan town in the country matter of
fact it was just a copper town which
owed its existence to the fact that the
gentry claim lay a half-mile from its
dust-shrouded streets

  now would you come again on that
order mister jennie said

  the thin lips of the stranger drew
tighter until they were a pale thread of
flesh across the taut skin i started to
avert trouble but he was too quick

  my dear young lady he said in
the oddest of gentle voices it made me
think of a wire being drawn through a
vise i dont think its necessary to
repeat my order because i think you
hear perfectly well therefore youve
come back for a bit of amusement at my
expense the proof if which im sure
lies in the grinning countenances of
these men watching

  i hid a grin quick like behind a
palm and waited for the buxom jennie
to blow her top it wasnt long in com-
ing

  look skinny she blazed out any
time you think id waste time on a
sawed-off pencil-pushing blue-nosey
who comes into a joint like this and
orders like hes at the ritz and then
gives the hasher lip youre nuts i
dont go for no stuff like that and if
you dont like that-you can go to  
to   

  atta gal jennie a new voice said
its harsh throatiness could only belong
to bull benton a mucker at the gentry

  he was sweet on the gal just as the
rest of us were but in a kind of way
that brought blood to our faces so that
even when he said the most innocuous
of phrases to her they seemed cloaked
in vileness i knew that suddenly i
was hot under the collar what was
more i suspected that he had put his
wanted-dead man



two cents in just to throw his weight
around he was standing to my right
and i could get the sweetly-sour smell
of his clothes sweat which hadnt been
washed away in a long time

  go on he continued tell the
little tinhorn what you want old bullll
back you up

  she turned on him like a tigress get
away from me you stinkin hunk of
dirt she shouted i dont need your
protection    i dont need your help
just mind your own little business
which is feedin your face

  i whipped my head around as the
little man beside me said in his pene-
trating voice

  precisely she could not have put
it better so why dont you do as the
lady suggests and go feed your face 
blood made a mottled mask of the
bearded face of the mucker he could
only glare in surprise at the words
then their import struck home and he
started for the little fellow

 heres one thing in common with
all muckers theyre usually mus-
cle-bound all their work is done with
their shoulders and legs benton was
no exception he moved like a milk-
heavy cow

  i whirled on my stool sending a stif-
fened arm at the end of which was a
very bony elbow into the midriff of the
big guy he doubled up with a howl of
pain it was long enough for me to
get to my feet

  we were about the same height but
the resemblance ended he outweighed
me by twenty pounds at least and he
was more muscular in the right places
but he was slow and that was my ace
in the hole my speed

  i shoved my hand against the top
of his head trying to get him off balance
it was a mistake which almost ended
the fight before it had more than

started he shot both hands to the one
i had on his hair and jerked down at
the same time butting upward with his
head

  i ducked that is partly his head
caught me a glancing blow along the
cheekbone and ripped the flesh as
though he had used a knife it was a
good thing i was wearing cleated boots
even as i went back i kicked sideways
the cleats catching him just below the
kneecap and again almost doubling him
up

  i heard the sound of jennies scream
as my blood spattered the counter when
i whipped my head to clear it of the
pain-fog then i could see clearly
again and bull was charging in i
danced out of the way and as he went
past i clipped him but good he half-
fell against the counter almost knocking
it over once more there was the high-
pitched sound of jennies voice but
i heard it only in the back of my mind
because i was busy trying to wear my
knuckles down on bulls jaw he
grunted every time i hit him but those
thick legs of his kept moving him for-
ward his arms were high he was
wide-open and i was slugging the hell
out of the guy but he kept coming in
for more i knew what he wanted to
get me in the circle of those arms and
what theyd do to me once they got me
there

  one eye was closed where i hit him
with a straight right but the other was
staring with a fearful intensity into
mine as he moved forward i feinted
with my left instinctively he blinked
and i started a right hook with all the
power at my command straight for the
button    and fell over one of the
spectators legs i landed hard enough
to knock the breath right out of me

  and bull was over me his arms still
hooked his body bent at the waist i
could see he was going to give me the
mammoth adventure

miners knockout jump on me with
both cleated boots and he wasnt going
to hit me in the belly it was my face
he was after i saw his tongue come out
in curious concentration saw his pants
belly out as the huge leg muscles con-
tracted in their jumping movement and
saw him suddenly topple sideways

phe little guy just stood there the
broken chair gripped in his hands
he stood there looking down at the
knocked out bull and turned slowly
deliberately to the rest and said

  i dont approve of fighting like
that

  i guess i ran lightning a close second
the way i got to my feet the place
was full of miners i knew these guys
their conception of fair play was a
long way from the man who had saved
me no fight no matter how dirty it
may seem brooked interference even
as i stepped to his side i could hear the
growls of the men

  without turning my head from the
circle of sullen bearded faces which had
suddenly formed a ring about us i took
the chair from the little guy i felt a
surge of admiration for him he was
breathing in gentle nasal gasps and
i could see from the corner of my eye
that he was as unflustered as if all this
was a meeting he was to address

  better step aside gloomy some-
body said from the rear i have always
noticed that its always someone from
the rear who starts the ball rolling
keeps feeding the flames the guys in
front are the ones who do the battling

okay boys i said softly fights
over go on back to your eatin
fights over for you the voice said
but not for nosey joe we want him
better do as gloomy says jennies
voice commanded

  she was suddenly the center of the
stage i guess we had all forgotten her

in the excitement of the fight she was
unforgettable now i looked up at her
she stood on top of the counter a 
looking a bit incongruous in her hand
yet somehow as if it belonged and
her eyes were narrowed in determina-
tion there was no doubt in my mind
that if needs be she would use the gun
i guess it struck the rest that she would
too

  if you guys think she continued
that im goin to run my size nines
down to the ground because your food
got cold you got another think coming
that hash you ordereds gettin mighty
heavy just sittin around and i aint
gonna cook up a new mess

  that did it jennie was not only the
waitress she was also the cook and the
proprietor of the place someone
laughed another said atta gal jen-
nie and another said well nothins
cookin gang lets go

  the sigh that i heaved came right out
of my boot tops no wonder it
squeaked the way i laced up my twelve
inchers but the little guy wasnt fazed
at all by the excitement he resumed
his seat and turned again to me it was
as if nothing had happened

  uh i began uh thanks for  
you know he said interrupting
me she is a primitive sort simple
but on the whole a rather decent sort
might even say splendid in her own
way

  jennie yeh i said falling in to
his mood a good kid came out
here on her own opened up this place
and made a go of it through her own
perseverance and    huh charm
plural you mean he said

  i thought i detected a twinkle in
those cold blue icicles of a sudden
i realized that i liked this strange little
man why i didnt know yet i felt
that there was something about him
which compelled my liking
wanted-dead man



t grinned down at him he smiled
a rather shy twisting of the lips
then the smile was wiped away by an
intent questioning look

  as i started to say before the ruck-
us began you look like an intelligent
sort ive come to this place to find
someone

  i put my hand on his arm turned my
face from him and looked to where
bull had fallen the big mucker had
skipped my mind entirely i was just
in time to see his friend a ratty indivi-
dual called jimsy assisting him
through the door then i turned back
to the stranger

  as i was saying i came to find
someone a man named alex soren-
sen the little man said

  sorensen sorensen i thought the
name was familiar but   

  what about this sorensen i
asked

  i have to deliver something to him
he said i heard he works at the
crows nest

  could be i said lots of swedes
up there

  hes not a swede the stranger
said hes a norwegian

  whats the difference hes big
blond and dumb like the rest of them
you work there also he asked
yeah im a machine man 

  his eyes narrowed in bewilderment
whats that he asked

  a fancy name for a dynamite tap-
per jennie said she was standing
before us her right arm loaded with
dishes the topmost two bearing steaks
from which smoke faintly curled she
set them before us and a couple of side
dishes of potatoes and vegetables and
said

  i dont know whether thats been
broiled like you want it but its done
like id want it now dont let me see
any of that steak on the plate when i

come for your dessert order

  there wasnt any either jennie
could cook like she had the gift the
strangers eyes were alight with pleas-
ure and he exuded a warmth which i
imagined was unusual with him after
the first bite

  as i said in the beginning he was a
precise little man it showed in the
way he cut his steak not fussy pre-
cise the pieces were all of one pat-
tern and size i imagined he was that
way in everything he did nothing ever
to be left to chance the kind of man
who was meant to be an auditor or
clerk in some lawyers office i could
see him drawing up briefs meticulously
briefs like traps from which there were
no loopholes of escape everything in
its place and a place for everything

  we got back to sorensen after our
coffee

  do you know many of the men who
work there he asked

  well i said theres about six
hundred working the three shifts cop-
pers in great demand of course ive
only been here some ten months and
the claims been going since the year
before the war however  

  yes he nudged me with the word
i know the night man in the office
i imagine hed go through the payroll
sheets if i asked him

  he would splendid the little
guy crowed he had a queer way of
accenting words to give them special
meaning

t looked at my watch just eight

  we had another four hours to go be-
fore my shift went on i got up from
the stool and said

  no use sitting here all night doing
anything

  why no i just got into town a little
while ago took the bus in from doug-
las a rather rough ride too matter


mammoth adventure

of fact ill have to look for a room to-
night but i was so hungry i couldnt
resist dining first

  i looked toward the tree on which his
derby hung there was no bag below
it nor did i remember him having
any he intercepted the look

  i left it at the bus station he ex-
plained

  lets get it i suggested he
closes a little after eight the last
auto-bus comes in then

  the howling cat was just around
the corner from the station but we had
to cross the dark depths of an alley be-
fore we hit the corner the motor
transports a trucking outfit had their
siding just past the alleys mouth i
was a little ahead of the little guy sort
of leading the way when all of a sud-
den a human catapault hit me at the
bend in the back of my knees and i
fold over like a broken accordion i
think the sound of the shot came a sec-
ond later

  i was a little shaky when i got to my
feet

  the little guy was standing facing
the darkness of the alley he was sort
of bent in a crouch i noticed that his
right hand was held kind of high and
close in to his left breast and that hand
was hooked like a claw then he turned
to me and said

  looks like someone was practicing
pistol shooting it was a fortunate
thing he stood before the overhead light
there

  i followed his pointing finger the
truckers had rigged up an overhead
light just above their platform it was
a three hundred watter at least and
i got the little guys meaning who-
ever had taken the pot-shot had been
outlined he had seen the shadow in
time to my life-or his life i said as
much

  he shrugged his narrow shoulders

and said

  no use worrying about it theyre
gone

  i laughed sharply who the hell was
going after them certainly not up that
alley

tjte had a single bag a plain leather
affair i lugged it for him up to
the joslyn house the only hotel in
town

  well he said after we had left the
room and descended to the lobby what
do we do now

  there isnt much to do mr beem-
ish he had registered as sylvester
beemish except do a bit of drinking
or go back to the cat or shoot a
little   

  i think ive had enough of shooting
for one night he said

  we can sit here and talk i said
frankly im curious about that
swede

  hes a he began sharply then less
irately whats the difference weve
been looking for him it seems that he
has something coming to him  

  we  i said

  oh i only represent these people
beemish said there is a matter of
debt    sorensen is involved and so
i was sent to find him it has been a
long quest i assure you

 why where are you from i
asked

  from    he hesitated then went
on chicago

  wouldnt it be a hell of a thing if
you were chasing the wrong man

  it would be he said though i
dont think so

  you mean youve got a picture of
him a description to go on i asked

  yes

  well i said that makes things
simpler mind if i see it

wanted dead man

by berkeley livingston

continued from page 

  he slipped his hand inside the breast
pocket of his serge suit and pulled out
a picture it was of a thick-shouldered
smiling man whose bland and rather
full features showed no distinguishing
traits

 looks like any of a hundred
swedes i said

 my god beemish exclaimed
arent there any others but swedes
who work here

  swedes and mexs i said this
is arizona mines depend on cheap
labor south of the border labor is
cheap and men work hard for a few
bucks a day the biggest end of get-
ting copper is a hard dirty job and
lately theyve been stopping new open-
ings that meant new help muckers
particularly had to be hired mexs
of course but to get back to the
swedes somehow theyve always been
associated with digging of one sort or
another and they make good foremen
beemish digested that in silence

  i asked is there more besides the
picture yknow identifying labels
sure beemish said and suddenly
reached for my hand pulling it off the
chair side and turning it palm-up sor-
ensen had a   he stopped and his
eyes went wide when he saw the criss-
cross of a dozen lacerations what un-
der the sun happened to you he
asked

  some caps went off when rocks fell
on one i said that fulminate makes
a hell of a show

  so i see he said slowly soren-
sen had a peculiar scar on his palm i
was going to show you what it looked
like

t was still holding the photograph in
my hand i looked at it once more
and noticed a peculiar graininess in the
texture beemish must have noticed
that i wasnt paying any attention to
him for he sullenly asked

  whats wrong do you recognize
something about the photo

  i shook my head n-no i said
or rather i should say that the photo-
graph strikes a chord of sorts but
well soon know wed better get to
the office before the shift goes on pay-
rollll be made up tonight and hell have
all the sheets there

  johnny was in the supes shack id
left beemish outside explaining to him
that it were best he did so johnny
was alone i asked him what i wanted
and he showed me the sheet i hap-
pened to look through the window and
saw beemishs face through the glass
he was watching us i smiled grimly at
him and nodded my head to show him
that id gotten what he wanted

  he was impatient inwardly excited
it showed in the sudden jerky sound of
his high voice

  well did you find out

  yes i said funny thing sor-
ensens working on my shift and in the
same stope of course we dont ask
anyone their name but usually some-
body knows

  so what do we do now he asked
tell you what i said come along
with me ive got to get things ready
and by the time im through the rest
of the shift will be there

  he was willing

  we hitched a ride on a dump truck
going back in number twenty at the
short branch i hopped off picked up a
couple of helmets and lamps for the
two of us got the lamps going and
started down the railbed

  we were about twelve hundred feet

wanted dead man

continued from page 

 in the air was still okay but i knew
 that another hundred feet where the
 tunnel narrowed and made the turn
 toward the stope i was working the air
 would become heavier damper

   there was the sound of voices and
 feet coming toward us i stopped beem-
 ish and drew him back along some
 muck sheets along the damp walls he
 grunted a sour something about his suit
 then the crew came along their lamps
 making glow-worm lights in the near
 distance they all looked curiously at
 the neatly dressed beemish a couple
 of them greeted me then they were
 gone

   at the turn we clambered over two
 trucks lying empty on the tracks and
 started up the stope timbers blocked
 beemish but i showed him around them
 and we came to the stope

   its a shame about your suit i
 said theres a good bit of water
 seepage here and this mucks heavy
 with it

   must we come here he asked bit-
 terly

   if you want to meet sorensen i
 said

   lead on he said

tvty hammer was lying near the
neatly coiled hose i looked up
at the face of the wall i was going to
blow tom my helper had done a good
job of marking fifteen streaks of sil-
ver against the grey walls showed where
hed tapped out my markings i at-
tached the hose to the hammer let it
take a couple of snorts to clear it and
turned to beemish

   he was standing against the wall
 watching me the taut skin of his
 face looked leaden and his eves were
wanted-dead man



slits of glowing ice his hands hung
limply at his sides he coughed a sigh
and said

  how long before sorensen gets
here

  i shrugged my shoulders and bent
over the cases of hercules a fifty foot
coil of fuse and four boxes of caps lay
beside one of the cases of dynamite i
knelt down and slipped my knife out
began to notch the fuse into two foot
lengths

  suddenly i felt him standing over me

  i turned my head and looked up at
him he was grinning tight-lipped at
me it was an odd grin twisted bitter
vengeful

  what the hell did you think youd
gain by telling me that sorensen will
be here he asked

  i started to stand and that hand
delicate and small as a womans went
to his shoulder holster with a deadly
speed

  stay put sorensenhe snarled

  i felt cold all of a sudden and it
wasnt because there was a chill in the
air just the look on his face was
enough it was a deaths head looking
at me

  what do you mean beemish i
asked

  did you think you were fooling
me he asked by dyeing your hair
black losing weight and scarring your
hand up that way ive been on your
trail too long three years

  i got tired of kneeling so i twisted
over and sat my back against the pile
of muck his hand had come out
there was a short-barreled automatic
in his palm the black hole from which
death was going to come at me looked
like the finger of doom

  xo i said slowly i didnt think
i was fooling you nor did you fool
me you look like your brother the
same features though he was heavier

but not meaner but tell me why did
you put your two cents in at the restau-
rant and back there when we were
coming to the bus station

  because i wanted it like this he
said and that bullet wasnt meant
for either you or me someone was just
shooting for some reason but i thought
id throw your mind off any track it
might take leading to suspicion

  i laughed though i didnt feel like
laughing its hard to be gay when
death is standing beside you and this
guy was a killer

t needed time i had to have it

  talk was one way of gaining it i
talked

  no you didnt fool me that pho-
tograph for instance was a copy it
was made from another picture the
original had a grained finish yours
showed the grain of the original then
the business of the scar you grabbed
my hand just to make sure no you
didnt fool me too much

  you almost did though  he said
the alex i was told to get and the
picture i had didnt stack up to what
you looked like but you gave yourself
away

  i wondered how he continued
first by little things like your
deliberately wanting to forget that sor-
ensen was a norwegian you kept in-
sisting he was a swede then a lifetime
of talking like an educated man cant
be lost in a few years but the clincher
was    he paused dramatically for
a second then went on the fight you
had with the big guy once a guys
been a fighter he never forgets how to
handle his mitts that straight right
after a double feint    only you had
it ive seen you fight and i sud-
denly remembered how youd shift your
left leg a trifle just before youd send
that right in
wanted-dead man



  there was a silence for a few seconds
after that

  so they didnt forget did they i
asked

  you mean about welching on that
deal beemish asked no not till
hell freezes over you were supposed
to blow that fight but no you got mad
because harris was fighting dirty so
you knocked him out well the big
guy lost fifty grand on that fight he
swore to get you

  he always was a bad loser that
brother of yours wasnt he i said

  i didnt see his hand move and im
not the slowest man in the world but
before i could more than shift the
smallest bit the barrel had smacked
me along the side of my skull stars
swung around me and for a second i
blacked out then his face swam into
view again the grin was wider now
he was enjoying this he was his
brothers blood

  god damn you he grated my
brother fried because of that fight
thats why im here not because of
fifty grand

  my mouth popped open i felt a
sticky wetness slide down the side of
my face where the barrel had raked me
his brother dead in the electric chair

  yeah he continued thats why
i wanted you    dead because you
were the reason he died

  but how i asked

  you skipped town but your man-
ager stayed and he and ned got into
an argument ned shot him and was
caught red-handed they gave him
the chair i vowed id get you for
that

  i made my move then i was in a
bad way sitting on my haunches the
way i was but i had to take the
chance he was already on the verge
of letting me have it so i heaved the
knife straight at his head at the same

 time scrambling erect the knife caught
 him over the eyes getting him off guard
 for a minute

   but quick as i was he was faster
 that damned gun came up again and
 smacked me gashing my mouth from
 the right corner all the way up the
 cheek worse it stopped me cold
 through a haze of blood and pain i
 saw the gun come up somehow i
 knew it was aimed at my head i
 ducked though a thought came to me
 how futile it was the gun went off
 in a flash of red and a sound like thun-
 der but that shot wasnt meant for
 me

   i stepped in and hit him he went
 back on his heels and i followed fast
 my hands clawing for the gun

 t never even saw his foot come up

   i only felt it strike me the whole
 damned tunnel exploded in a wave of
 pain as he caught me squarely in the
 groin i dont know how many times
 he hit me from then on there was a
 feeling like i was sinking under a warm
 blanket and everything went dark

   something struck me in the side i
 groaned and opened my eyes he was
 standing over me that damned gun
 pointed at my middle i reached in
 sudden sickness and he laughed at the
 sound

   get up he said

   i got to my feet weaving like i was
 drunk

   now tie that fuse around your mid-
 dle he commanded

   i did as he said

   now stick one end into one of those
 sticks of dynamite

   i understood what he wanted then
 he was going to make me blow myself
 to kingdom come

   i broke open the top to one of the
 sticks and inserted the fuse then he
 made me face the wall when i was
wanted-

the way he wanted me he stepped to my
side shoved the gun against my back
and brought the stick around so that
i couldnt reach it i wondered what
he was up to

  put your hands behind your back
he said

  when i did he slipped a piece of
rope around my wrists he had evi-
dently made a loop while i was out be-
cause he just slipped it taut then he
told me to turn around again before
i knew what he was doing he went
down to his knees and slipped another
noose around my ankles then he
pushed me down i fell flat on my
face gashing my nose on a piece of
razor-edged quartz

  i heard a match sputter then heard
the unforgettable sound of a piece of
fuse taking fire

  in a little while i heard him say
that fuse will burn to where itll fall
off but you wont be able to do any-
thing about it id love to stay and
watch you try to take those ropes off
thatd be a race id like to see but i
cant itll be an accident and im
in the clear easy isnt it

  once more his foot drew back and
came at me this time he ripped the
flesh right off my cheek it was his
farewell to me

  turning he scrambled down the
slope i heard his feet move off in
the darkness then he made the turn
in the tunnel i waited for a few sec-
onds it came a shrill scream of fear
   then silence

  he had fallen into the shaft it was
three hundred feet to the bottom we
had pumped the water out of it when
number twenty was flooded i had
fixed his lamp so that the flame would
not last more than ten minutes it had
gone out just as he had made the turn
coming up i had shielded the pit with
my body hed never noticed it

ruffian dick
explorer

continued jrom page 

perilous his position became it was certain death
if his true identity as an unbeliever should be
discovered his remarkable linguistic ability stood
him in good stead quiet and unpretentious he
drew little attention from the rest but always his
dark eyes darted to and fro taking mental notes
for the future so that the outer world the world
of the west might someday know what they had
only been able to guess at for so many years
were the stories true that told about the fabulous
riches of mecca what did the mysterious rites
consist of burton was bent on finding out at
last shining white and dirty in the sunlight stood
mecca burtons heart rose high at the sight

  now he was called upon to exercise even greater
skill in imitating the actions of the others utilizing
all the patience at his command to maintain the
character of a pilgrim he had to live the arab
as completely as it was possible for any alien to
do and he seems to have done it very completely

  there followed days of pilgrimage to this and
that site throughout the holy city culminating
in the visit to the kaaba that centre of islam
older than islam itself with the sacred black
stone much be-kissed by the crowding pilgrims
burton when it came his turn knelt and kissed
with an equal piety but a sharp eye he noted
the texture and appearance of the stone decided
that it was an aerolite stored the fact away in
his mind for future use and passed on with pray-
ing lips and hooded eyes   

  the strain on burton was very great he was
haunted by the thought that some night some
hour his veil would slip aside and he would be-
tray by alien gesture or motion that un-islamic
soul of his then the caravan gathered and mecca
became once more a mere speck on the horizon
burton reached the british consulate on the coast
a different man memories of little indignities and
the discomforts he had to bear preyed upon his
sensitive mind until outwardly in every respect
he was likened to the ruffian dick people had
dubbed him the account he later published of
his exploit in penetrating arabia cast off the veil
ruffian dick explorer

of darkness that had hung over it for so long

  back in service in india he was selected to
undertake a new venture this time in the interest
of the east india company for some time thc
indian government had toyed with the idea of
the exploration of eastern africa particularly
somaliland they wished to know the population
of the region the habits and appearances of its
people the exact location of the forbidden city of
harar far inland burtons proposal was that he
be landed on the east african shore with suitable
provisions and money in the company of two
others the expedition would set out across the
country visit mysterious harar pass on to gan-
anah and so reach zanzibar

  without delving into the actual day-by-day
account of the incidents which befell the group
it is enough to say that the venture was a com-
plete success from the standpoint of knowledge
gained on the other hand the sufferings and
hardships of the trail from raiding bands of rob-
bers from dangerous animals which lurked nearby
in the night dysentery and fever made the effort
call for a very rare brand of heroism burton
returned home with scars a somali had thrust a
javelin into the explorers mouth lacerating his
lips and cheek

  resting in england he wrote his first foot-
steps in east africa burtons now peaceful and
placid existence got on his nerves and he was
anxious to be off again the arundel family still
regarded him as an unfit son-in-law and advised
him to make an attempt at success in his own
profession

  the crimean war was now being waged burton
sailed for the crimea on his own responsibility
there he joined beatons irregulars became adju-
tant drew up elaborate plans for new modes of
cavalry attack and general tactics and impatiently
awaited action

  he waited in vain the war dragged on by
now a war of siege and sortie and repulse hav-
ing little or no need for gay irregulars in cavalry
uniform burton sank to quick despondency   
and as he dreamed of what he might be doing
his thoughts drifted to africa again and the pos-
sibilities of another expedition this time to seek
out the sources of the nile

  back in england after the war burton laid
his plans before the royal geographical society
remembering his joumey to harar and also the
news of livingstones discoveries in the southern
parts of central africa burtons plan interested
them the primary object of the expedition would
be to ascertain the limits of the sea of ujiji-a
great sheet of water of which rumor had travelled
down to the east coast he was also to in-
vestigate the exportable produce of the interior
and the ethnography of its tribes

  with a grant of  pounds and speke to
accompany him burton set out on his fourth
journey into unknown regions it was a large
and well-equipped e-pedition which disembarked

 at zanzibar in december  a thorough study
 was made of every aspect of the island and its
 people this took several months and it was not
 until june of the next year that the expedition
 headed into the interior burton was the first
 white man to look upon lake tanganyika

   burton set about to plan for a thorough ex-
 ploration of the lake region too ill to move he
 called speke to him and laid before him a tenta-
 tive plan speke agreed to take half the caravan
 and set out on the mission when speke later
 rejoined burton he had vague news to tell of a
 great lake he discovered burton became disgusted
 with the roundabout replies he received to his
 queries and gave up the caravan set out for the
 coast

   while burton lay ill in the hospital speke
 hurried to england he published an account of
 the expedition stressing his own discovery of the
 lake he named victoria nyanza made no mention
 of burton and affirmed his opinion that the nile
 rose in the victoria nyanza he was greeted with
 great acclaim honored everywhere and funds
 were raised to equip a new expedition under his
 command burton arrived in england to find him-
 self robbed of his fame

   at this time richard burton faded from public
 view he wrote bitter articles against speke which
 were not widely read and then looked about for
 something to do voyaging to america he spent
 some time with the mormons he returned to
 write the usual book and to marry isabel arundel
 to the end of his days he moved from one
 foreign and distant shore to another appointed
 counsel to fernand po then brazil damascus
 and trieste his curiosity for new places was only
 partly satisfied when well over fifty he rode out
 in search of the gold mines of midian from da-
 mascus spent a vigorous holiday in iceland and
 continued writing manuscript after manuscript
 finally between  and  he set to the
 translating of a completely literal english version
 of the arabian nights the translation was
 very well received and burton was now a rich
 man

let your head take you

the average american today has a choice of iust
where his feet take him or choosing wisely the
course to follow lets skip ahead  years and take a
look at john ones-and listen to him   

      omftimkv  irr vo good f almost scares me

      this house- i wouldnt swap a shingle off its rnof
for any other house i n earth this little valley with the
pond down n the hw it the back is the spot i like best

 ill all the wnrkl

and theyre mine i -wn em nobody can take em
away from me

ive got a little rrone coming in regularly not much
-but enough anv i tel you when you can go to bed every
night with nothing on your mind except the tun youre going
to have tomorrow- thats as near heaven as man gets on
this earth

it wasnt always so

hack in - that was right alter the war and sometimes
the going wasnt tou easy-i needed cash taxes were tough

and then fllen got sick like almost everybody else i was
buying bonds through the payroll plan-and i figured on
cashing some of them in but sick as she was it was ellen
who talked me out ot it

   dont do it john she said please dont for the first
time in our lives we re really saving money its wonderful
to know that every single payday we have more money put
aside john it we can only keep up this saving think yvhat

	can mean maybe someday you wont have-to work
maybe we can own a home and oh how good it would feel
to know that we need never worry about money when we re
old

  well even after she got better i stayed away from the
weekly poker game quit dropping a little cash at the hot
spots now and then -gave up some of the things a man feels
he has a right to we didnt have as much fun for a while
but we paid our taxes and the doctor and-we didnt touch
the bonds

  whats more we kept right on putting our extra cash
into i  s sivines bonds and the pay-off is making the
world a pretty swell place today
