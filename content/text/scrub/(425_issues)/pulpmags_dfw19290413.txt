      how america gets its rum-the inside story of the

 as told to don h thompson

chapter i

the bootleg chief

there we sat the two of us
empty of stomach and pocket
with nothing to do but wonder
if we would ever get another square
meal

    a fat negro played a monotonous
  jangling tune on an ancient piano
  waiters hurried to and fro glasses rat-
  tled on the bar there was much loud
  talking and laughter but we paid no
  attention to the merriment we sipped
  our beers as slowly as possible for we
  had but a dime between us inside the

detective fiction weekly

piccadilly cafe it was light and warm
and outside it was a wet chilly new
orleans night

  if we can get a flop some place
said graves as calmly as though he
had a hundred-dollar bill tucked in ev-
ery pocket  we might be able to snare
a berth on a rum runner to-morrow

  i did not even answer i was im-
mersed in gloom being broke was no
new experience to me but our luck had
been consistently bad for more than
two weeks and i could not make myself
believe that it was about to change for
the better

   would you ship on a whisky
boat persisted graves

   id do anything i growled
 anything to get the black cat off my
back

  we returned to gazing with medi-
tative dejection at the damp table top
from the corner of my eyfe i saw a
waiter hovering expectantly behind us
after a few minutes of watching he
approached

   another beer

   no said graves

   anything else

   no 

  the waiter dropped his servile pose
he was a burly fellow and he spread
his big hands upon the table and said
 you bums cant sit here without
buying buy or get outand make room
for somebody that  spend some
dough

   who said so 

  graves was on his feet he was big
and tough and wicked his temper
strained by hunger was as mean as
that of a wild cat the waiter undis-
mayed took a step toward him one
hamlike hand doubled into a hard fist
then gravess punch caught him be-

hind the ear and he went down like a
log without even the subconscious re-
flex of arms thrown out to break his
fall

  in an instant the place was in an up-
roar a bartender and a half a dozen
plug-uglies started toward us armed
with bottles they were the riffraff
of the new orleans water front and
their ragged clothes probably concealed
more than one sharp knife

  were in for it said i

   well clean em up snarled
graves he peeled off his coat swift-
ly  come on you dirty bums

  a shadow fell across the table a
well-built well-dressed man of medi-
um size stood between us and the
crowd

   whats the matter boys  he in-
quired pleasantly  havin a little
trouble

   yeah said graves  and it looks
like were due for worse

  the newcomer turned to the men

   have a drink on the house he
said  ill handle this thing to suit
myself the crowd surged back to
the bar our rescuer touched a match
to a fat cigar before he spoke again
broke

   flat said i

   want a job

  yes retorted graves well
take any kind of a job

  the fellow grinned at my compan-
ion

   a man with a right hand punch
like yours hadnt ought to be beggin
for work he said  come on fol-
low me

  and without even a backward glance
at the fallen waiter who was now be-
ginning to stir and gasp for air like a
fish out of water we walked away to

    editors note-don h thompson the man who wrote the history of
the mafia in america in  black hand  an article which appeared in detec-
tive fiction weekly and also wrote the gripping story of dint colbeck
st louiss  king of crime has scored another journalistic triumph with this
inside story of the working of the liquor traffic his informant is a wealthy
and powerful bootlegger
the roaring road



a narrow little room under the back
stairs where we sat around a table and
talked

   my names hurd said our host
removing his derby  i own this bar
and i do a pretty good business with
some big guys over in cuba they run
the stuff in but i have to go out after
it in small boats and get it into town
some of it i use here and the rest goes
north over the highway to kansas city
and st louis

   its a risky business but a good one
 can always use good strong depend-
able men you birds looked like pret-
ty good prospects and thats why i
stepped into your fight what do you
say  interested 

   absolutely said graves i said
nothing at all

   who are you 

   sailors

   show me something to prove it i
cant take any chances on getting the
wrong guys to guard my liquor
graves had several letters addressed
to him aboard our last ship and i had
my mates papers hurd spread them
all upon the table and read them care-
fully

   looks all right he said at last
 you see i prefer to pick my own
men as  go along i never hire a guy
who asks me for a job figure that if
i used that system id be payin wages
to some prohi and my next stopping
place would be leavenworth

   now listen bovs this job takes
cool steady heads and plenty of insides
but youll find its easy work and good
money you guard the stuff and your
pay goes on as long as you bring home
the bacon if you lose a load thats
your tough luck and youre fired
agreed

   right said graves

   heres a ten-spot went on hurd
 get yourselves a good square meal
and come back about eleven oclock
well start out to do some business
 say said graves  are we guard-
ing this stuff against dry agents

  hurd laughed exposing solid gold
teeth

  dry agents hell he snorted
 we dont worry about those birds
its hi-jackers that get our trucks i
lost two last month and by god i dont
propose to get stuck for a third one
theres going to be a lot of plain and
fancy shooting on some of these roads
to-night if bascoms bunch tries to lift
any of my stuff

  yve took his tenner and headed for
the nearest restaurant

  and that my friend is how i became
a rum runner that is how i quit be-
ing an honest ships mate and tossed
my lot with the ex-convicts ex-prize
fighters bouncers gamblers and gun-
men who combine to make a mockery
of the law which says that strong drink
shall not be consumed in these united
stales once in with them i never
had a moment of hesitation all about
me i saw ignorant men many of them
criminals growing rich i determined
to make a fortune

  i began at the very bottom toting a
shotgun to keep hi-jackers from steal-
ing the cargo and worked my way up
until i owned distilleries ships trucks
and warehouses and commanded the
services of several hundred sea cap-
tains shore men drivers bottlers and
label counterfeiters

  during the year just past the syndi-
cate of which i am the head shipped
more than five million dollars worth
of alcohol rum whisky and champagne
north from new orleans the tre-
mendous percentage of profit on this
amount of liquor will be readilv re-
alized when i tell you how the stuff was
manufactured and run into the coun-
try the losses to government dry
agents have been practically none but
the ruthless hi-jackers are and always
will be the fly in the otherwise smooth
ointment of the bootleggers for them
we wear bullet-proof vests and carry
sub-machine guns and many a battle is
fought on a lonely road at night the

prize being a five-ton truck filled to the
top with cuban whisky

  when i retire from this business
with more than a million dollars i will
go to my country estate and live the
quiet life of a rural gentleman but
there will be others behind me the
unslaked thirst of the big cities will
continue to roll fortunes in gold into
the laps of those who are strong enough
to take and hold control of the liquor
supply the prohibition law will never
be enforced until people get tired of
the rotten stuff we give them there will
always be rum runners and bootleggers

  it would take the whole army and
navy to prevent the whisky pirates from
landing their cargoes at new orleans
alone there is a town that is the rum
runners dream of a perfect city it is
so situated that all of the natural ad-
vantages are with the smuggler and
it has become the home of the syndicate
men the ship owners ship captains
truck owners salesmen and thugs who
form the motley bootleg army the
pirates who infested new orleans in
olden times never mustered a more
hardboiled murderous bunch of men
they make a handsome living bringing
in the liquor and since there are more
than eighty ways of getting a boat into
the mississippi from deep water hun-
dreds of islands where a schooner may
anchor thousand of places where small
boats can unload and many routes into
the city it will be seen tht the risk is
really very small

  to combat this vast army of men
who quench the nations thirst the gov-
ernment had two cutters and between
thirty and fifty men on the job in new
orleans they might as well try to
drink all the water in the ocean now
and then they capture a fellow with a
small load but i have never known
them to get their hands on one of the
big operators if they catch a loaded
boat the men who are sent to jail are
just hirelings

  i believe that i know this game as
well as any man in the united states

certainly i have been a success at it
ive gone all through the mill

  to give you a clear comprehensive
picture of the inside operations of the
liquor rings i am going to tell you my
own story i am going to tell you
where the whisky is made how it is
made what it costs to manufacture
how it is smuggled into the united
states how it is sent to your home
town how it is distributed and who
gets the huge profits that you pay every
time you buy a drop of illicit liquor

  i am going to take the cover off the
underworld of booze and let you see
the distillers label counterfeiters sea
captains gunmen hi-jackers and boot-
leg kings in action i am going to tell
you of the murder blackmail bribery
graft and corruption of every kind
which is closely interwoven with the
activities of these men the whole ma-
chinery of the enormous industry
which has resulted from the eighteenth
amendment will be revealed none of
it will be opinion it will be the facts
the true story of a desperate young
man who saw an opportunity to win a
life of ease and luxury and took it

chapter ii
the first skirmish

for the proper beginning of my
narrative i must again go back to
that rainy night in new orleans
when my friend graves and i started
out to guard a cargo of liquor being
hauled in from a bootleggers hangout
on shell beach

  it was a night as dark as the inside
of a wolfs stomach with a fine rain
being driven in from the sea i sat
in the rear of a lurching truck a shot-
gun across my knees beside me was
 shady  smith a noted and talented
administrator of lead poisoning he
was a wicked little morsel of a man
with a bent beak of a nose and the
cauliflowered ears of a former ringster

   new aint you asked smith tak-
ing a generous chew of cut-plug
the roaring road



   new on this job i replied for
i had no intention of letting him know
that i was a green hand

   well you picked a hot spot
theres always hell to pay when the
booze hustlers fight among themselves
and bascoms gang has been gettin
away with so much murder that he
thinks he owns all the hooch thats
shipped into new orleans baby
wont he get fooled if he monkeys with
this layout

    ill tell the world said t

  smith leaned out of the jolting vehi-
cle and peered into the darkness ahead

   guess were all here got three
big trucks and four hearses to-night

   hearses

   sure didnt you ever hear of
that racket before one of kid hurds
brightest ideas the booze that goes
to his joint goes in trucks the stuff
that goes through the town and north
travels in undertakers dead wagons
they split up each travels a different
route and who the hell would ever
think of looking for tiger-juice in a
nice pretty gray hearse neat eh

  i laughed to myself truly there
was more to this bootlegging game
than i had suspected a resourceful
fellow with a little ingenuity and a
small organization could make a for-
tune right then i began to lay plans
for the future

  the truck came to a shuddering halt

   here we are said shady smith
and tumbled out of the truck lugging
his sub-machine gun i followed suit
and saw that we were at the waters
edge on a narrow sandy beach the
trucks and hearses were turned around
and the work of loading them with
the cases of whisky and tins of alcohol
began the stuff had been piled upon
the beach and was being watched by
a picked crew of hurds gunmen

  as i came up to my truck with a
tin of alcohol i passed graves

    great stuff isnt it he asked

    it is said i  it looks like were
in a big game all right

  as each vehicle was filled it started
back toward the city a guard on the
front seat beside the driver and an-
other sitting in the body with the
liquor the men worked like machines
each fellow knew his job and did it
with precision

  when our truck was ready smith
found me and restored my wreapon

    ill ride with the driver he said
 you get in the back and stay there
if anybody starts anything with us
you stick in the back dont hop out
into the road if you do theyll get
you the edge will be yours if youre
shooting at em from the inside this
canvas top wont protect you from bul-
lets but it  hide you get me

  i got him the ride back to the
city began i could see nothing there
was nothing to do but wait develop-
ments once or twice the truck came
to a halt and i sat up tense and alert
with my shotgun ready but we moved
on again and i relaxed leaning against
a case of liquor and wondering how
much i would be paid for the trip

  we had gone about halfway to our
destination when i was jolted out of
my reverie by smiths hoarse excited
voice

   theres something doing down the
line he bawled  heads up now
the truck stopped then crawled for-
ward slowly growling along in low
gear there came a brief rattle of
rifle and pistol fire the truck swayed
into a ditch

  chak chak chak chak smiths ma-
chine gun ate into a belt of clips and
spat death into the night

   take that you thieving dogs he
howled the gun chattered again i
crouched on my knees with my shot-
gun ready for action but there was no
need it was all over in an instant
a gang of hi-jackers had tried to cut
off the truck just ahead of us had
shot and seriously wounded one of the
guards but had fled into the surround-
ing woods when mr smith arrived
with his stuttering weapon


detective fiction weekly

   i told you wed get em exulted
that worthy his white teeth gleamed
in the darkness  wait until i tell
hurd well get a bonus for this
-nights work

  the trucks climbed back to the road-
way and proceeded cautiously into the
city without further difficulty we
drove to a dry goods store in a middle-
class neighborhood unloaded our
liquor and stowed it in the cement-
lined basement under the place then
the six of us including the driver and
two guards from the other truck got
into a small touring car and hurried to
hurds saloon where smith recited the
details of the encounter

   good work said hurd he
scratched a few words on a piece of
paper and handed it to the gunman
here give this to limpy see you
to-morrow night may have some stuff
cached down on that bayou by then

  we reentered our machine and drove
to a water front warehouse which we
entered by a secret door up two
flights of stairs and we came out into
a large room where a man sat behind
a kitchen table he was hanked by
four heavily armed ruffians this man
at the table was unlike an ordinary
human being he was stoop-shoul-
dered with a mean narrow face and
ratlike anxious eyes before him was
a dirty ledger and a pile of currency

   hello limpy said smith with
easy familiarity  we come for our
dough

  the man lehind the table snickered

  always first arent you he
asked

   i like to get paid admitted smith
 you act as though you were giving
away a quart of your blood every time
you fork over i earned my money
to-night look at this he tossed
the paper which hurd had given him
upon the table

  limpy looked at it carefully then
he dipped into the currency and
counted out fifty dollars

   twenty-five for the trip and twen-

ty-five for saving the truck he said
grudgingly

   this guy gets the same said
smith pointing to me limpy paid me
off and then began counting out money
for the others

   well kid laughed smith  i
guess thats all for to-night see you
to-morrow maybe well ride together
again

  we left limpy writing in his dirty
ledger and i set out to find graves to
see howr he had fared on our first night
of adventure as the paid hirelings of
the rum ring i had made fifty dollars
and was content the fact that i might
just as easily have been lying at the side
of a lonely road with my hide full of
bullet holes did not enter into my cal-
culations this was the game for me
and all manner of wild schemes raced
through my head as i strode through
the darkened streets

chapter iii

a dead mans cargo

once more we sat in the piccadily
cafe graves and i and this time
we looked upon our world and
found it good we had been working
for hurd for two months we had
made a stake and were restless with
the plans which wre had been discussing
while we watched over our employers
whisky we had agreed to seize the
first opportunity to get into the rum
game for ourselves

  and nowr graves smoking a cigar
and looking quite prosperous in a new
suit of clothes was outlining a propo-
sition

   theres an old guy over near point
a la hache who has about fifty cases
of scotch that he wants to let go of
hes broke brought the stuff in and
landed it on the beach then got in 
row with his pals and drove them off
with a gun he hasnt been able to
get a truck and even if he had one
lies afraid to try to make it into town
figures his former friends tipped off
the roaring road



bascom and fears that the hi-jackers
are laying for him

   we could buy the stuff cheap prob-
ably as low as twenty dollars a case
we could sell it right here for thirty-
five and if we wanted to run it north
we could get a lot more of course
if we get stuck up our investment is
sunk want to take a chance

   sure i said without hesitation
 this whole game is based on chance
i can get smith to help us

   and i could get the truck said
graves  well drag the hooch in and
peddle it to burney hes got a flock
of phony milk trucks going to st louis
next week

  we were mulling the scheme over
in our minds when a girl in a short
red dress and a rov of spangles around
her neck came up to our table she
was one of hurds entertainers

   you gave me a five-dollar bill last
night she said to graves

  yeah he agreed i gave it to
you to get rid of you think you can
tap me every night

  the girl smiled at him

   no i just want to tell you some-
thing bascotns on your trail and you
better look out i was told all about
it by a red-hot who hangs out in his
gambling hall bascom says you two
birds kept him from copping one of
hurds trucks and pumped one of his
best men full of lead hes looking to
get even

 thanks said graves dryly
well take care of brother bascom
when the girl left he turned to me
 looks like weve made an enemy
 its a bluff said i if we can
get a start on this first job well hire
smith and a few of his hardboiled
friends away from hurd and they can
all go to hell lets have a drink

   not me objected graves  the
more i see of this bootleg stuff the
more i like orange juice we better
go see hurd and arrange to get off to-
morrow

  so it was that we journeyed toward

point a la hache the next night in a
rattling truck outward bound on the
first of our many bootlegging adven-
tures in the rear with his legs hang-
ing over the side was mr shady
smith a machine gun in the crook of
his arm

  thirty miles from town we parked
the truck at the side of the road left
smith with it and struck off through
the brush and scrub trees presently
we came to a trail which we followed
with the aid of a flash light and soon
we emerged into a little clearing i
saw a sort of a shack an open affair
with a canvas roof supported by four
posts under the canvas was a table
and at one end of the table was a man

   asleep said graves  come on
make some noise hes liable to get
excited and drill us

  we walked noisily forward the
man suddenly awakened jumped to
his feet a gun in his hand

   steady called graves  weve
come to take the white elephant off
your hands

  the fellow grinned sheepishly and
lowered his weapon

   i remember you he said  you
were over here last week well ill
be glad to get out im about dead for
sleep and i figured some of these high-
binders would have my stuff before i
could sell it

   weve got nine hundred dollars
said graves  its yours for the
liquor providing you help us load it
thats a good price since we are tak-
ing all the chances

   it isnt as much as i expected
replied the runner  but i guess it will
do im in no spot to bargain come
on lets get busy

  i passed over the money and the
work of loading the liquor began the
cases were hidden in the brush back
of the camp and we were hours getting
them out and down to the truck when
the cargo was stowed and we were
ready to leave graves invited the run-
ner to ride into town with- us


detective fiction weekly

  not a chance was his reply
 why because im afraid you boys
will never get there no sir ill walk
and with that cheering pronounce-
ment he ducked off into the weeds and
was gone

   look sharp now commanded
graves who was driving  shoot first
and talk to the corpse afterward if
these buzzards get the jump on us
were done

  we moved forward slowly and with-
out lights

  it had been a dark night when we
started out with a sultry premise of
rain in the air but now the moon was
climbing the sky a dim silver bubble
striving against the heavy clouds we
could see the road as it stretched out
ahead of us

   a little light wont hurt said
graves  we can get a look at any-
body that comes along anyway

  as he spoke he jammed on the
brakes threw out the clutch and we
rolled to a silent stop

   something around that next curve
looks like a truck you and smith
scout ahead ill stay here

  smith came from the rear with his
machine gun and together we hurried
along the road turning the corner cau-
tiously

  truck whispered the gunman in
my ear there it stood a heavy well-
made machine with a brown canvas
cover there was not a soul in sight
we hurried forward

   holy smoke cried smith who
was in the lead  theres a dead guy
on the runnin board plunked right
through the head

  the man was sprawled out in awk-
ward fashion his head and shoulders
jammed under the wheel his legs dan-
gling on the running-board smith ig-
noring the body trotted to the rear of
the truck and lifted the canvas

  loaded boy this is just like
finding money come on lets try to
start her up

  we worked for ten minutes and gave

up in disgust the battery was evi-
dently dead

   thats why them hi-jackers didnt
move her explained smith  they
bumped this guy off then they went
away and left the whole works when
the rig wouldnt start say ill bet a
bullet musta hit the battery eh he
lifted the floor-boards of the car quick-
ly  sure enough knocked it all to
hell well we aint beat yet we can
shove her hurry the boys will be
back here pretty quick

  we jogged back to the waiting
graves and explained the situation he
agreed readily with smiths suggestion
and a few minutes later we were again
on our way to town this time we
had two trucks loaded with liquor in-
stead of one

  urged on by smith graves made
good time although it was awkward
work shoving the seized truck and we
had nothing to use for a towline it
was almost dawn when we pulled up
to the garage owned by a gentleman
named burney the garage was just a
blind mr burney was one of the
most extensive liquor wholesalers in
new orleans we drove into the place
and graves and burney talked in low
tones in one corner

  when graves returned to us he
said

   all fixed burney takes the whole
works and hell get rid of the truck so
nobodyll know who grabbed off their
hooch well come back for our wagon
to-morrow all right 

   fine said i  if the price is
right

   its one hundred per cent profit on
the stuff we bought and two thousand
for the other

   okay approved smith and the
bargain was struck we gave smith
a third on the truck we bad found and
went home and to bed very well satis-
fied with the result of our initial ven-
ture as big-league bootleggers it had
been an interesting night we had made
more than two thousand dollars and
tiie roaring road



our belief that we were in the right
business had been confirmed

  we realized of course that we
could have made more with the proper
kind of backing and organization
graves mentioned it the next day when
we were talking over our plans

   burney will truck that stuff to
kansas city and almost double his
money said graves he is in touch
with a mob and he gets the best prices
possible thats what we should be
doing buying this stuff at the beach
and selling it to saloon keepers up
north where liquor is worth big jack
i know where i can get enough for two
trucks suppose we make a stab at
peddling it in st louis

   it sounds good to me said i
how do we go about it

   heres the dope ive been keep-
ing my ears to the ground ever since
we worked for hurd and theres two
things i know we need one is a place
to store the stuff and the other is a
stand-in with a certain gangster in st
louis this fellow controls the whis-
ky business there and he is lined up
with politicians who carry the keys to
the jail

   if we get in right with them there
is no limit to our market we can run
all the booze we want to and clean up
suppose you hop a rattler north buy
some kind of a business joint as a blind
and put the fix on the gang leader and
his friends

   a good idea i replied  in the
meantime you can snoop around and
get another bunch of liquor lined up

chapter iv

graves gets vengeance

a few days later i was in st
louis registered at a good hotel
and spending most of my time
reading newspaper advertisements of
various business concerns which were
for sale one by one i looked the
prospects over and finally i found a
place that appealed to me as being al-

most perfect for our purposes it was 
a feed store  the south side ap-
parently on its last legs for the ger-
man proprietor was glad to sell out
lock stock and barrel for a thousand
dollars down and my note for a like
amount he was voluble in his de-
scription of his wonderful establish-
ment he did not know that i had no
interest in anything save the fine dry
strong basement underneath

  now for the gangster i had learned
by now that one of the most important
things in my new profession was to
know the right people it is seldom
that the rum runner approaches the
representatives of the law themselves
he usually works through other per-
sons in this case i was depending 
the gangster to pull the correct political
strings and see that our trucks were
not molested either by the authorities
or by the thugs who made a business
of robbing honest hooch carriers

  i met my man in his st louis
county resort it did not take me
long to outline my proposition and i
tossed in the name of hurd to help
things along

  when i had finished he looked at
me from brooding eyes and said

    itll cost you five bucks a case

   thats fair enough

   you wont be bothered by the red-
hots went on the gangster  and the
law will lay off as long as you work on
the quiet phone me from down the
line each time you come in one of
my boys will meet you count the cases
and take the dough then hell ride in
with you therell be no trouble
we shook hands  the bargain and
i left to return to new orleans where
i found graves fuming and fretting at
the delay he had two good cargoes
spotted and he craved action he got
it

  we rented three trucks hired
shady smith and several of his rough-
neck pals and headed north the
trip was completed without trouble
the whisky was stored in the base-


detective fiction weekly

ment of the feed store and in a
week it was all sold to st louis bar
owners and we were back ifome with
more money than either or both of us
had ever seen in all our lives

   we need a bigger layout de-
clared graves  were working on
too small a scale just think how much
dough we could make if we pulled off
one of these trips every week

   acting on his suggestion i hired an
office in a down town building where i
set myself up as the representative of
a new york leather company and
from this place we transacted all our
business graves became the buying
agent and i handled the arrangements
for the transportation and sale of the
stuff at the other end with the mur-
derous mr smith as my first assistant

  it was a busy life we worked
night and day sleeping and eating
when and where we could we bought
cargo after cargo from the independent
shippers running out of cuba and
various south american ports and sold
the liquor-s c o t c h and canadian
whisky and raw alcohol-in st louis
louisville and kansas city our con-
nections in all three of those towns
were excellent and grew better as our
importance in the underworld in-
creased in proportion to the size of our
bank roll

   despite our success i found myself
at times in the depths of despair for
a fellow who would have peace and
quiet and the caresses of a wife and
children it was a hopeless outlook for
a man who would sleep in a bed and
smoke his pipe in security it was a bad
business we lived violently and gave
promise of dying the same way we
wore bullet-proof vests never went out
minus our pistols spent our nights on
the front seat of a lurching truck and
our days in plotting our schemes of
bribery and corruption

  graves usually jollied me out of
these fits of depression

   youre in the greatest game in the
world he would say  in a few

years you can quit and do just as you
damned please for the rest of your life
snap out of it

  his words were unnecessary i knew
i was sitting pretty and i had no in-
tention of quitting but i could not help
but wonder now and then if the effort
was worth the result

  it was at this stage in our careers
that we were dealt a blow that almost
ruined us

  we had invested a large part of our
capital in four truck loads of whisky
and had delegated smith and his bullies
to bring it into new orleans bascom
and his gang after lying low for
several months came out of hiding
suddenly surrounded our vehicles on
the road killed one of our men
wounded smith and drove away with
their loot

  graves swore dire vengeance when
he heard the news but i reminded him
that vengeance would not restore our
stolen whisky or revive our waning
bank accounts

   then said he  ill figure out
some way to get our money back if we
have to hold bascom up and rob him

  it was days before he perfected his
plan but i found him in our little
apartment one night bubbling over
with enthusiasm

  ive got it he cried heres
where we stick bascom well get our
cash and have a good laugh at his
expense remember jacobs the loan
shark

  i said that i recalled the gentleman
as an extremely unsavory individual
who frequented the tavern a gam-
bling house in which bascom was re-
ported to have a financial interest

   hes more than that said graves
 hes bascoms agent sort of a society
bootlegger he was well acquainted
among the wealthy people of the town
and he keeps them supplied with liquor
at fancy prices all of bascoms best
stuff goes to jacobs and they split the
profit

   a shrewd fellow from all that i
the roaring road



can hear the story of how he got his
start is a good example of the mans
ability he ferreted out a society
dame who was rather hard up for cash
this lady was famous for her parties
jacobs made a deal with her every
time a guest asked where she got her
fine liquor she replied from a very
high-class gentleman mr jacobs he
handles only the best then she would
slip the guest mr jacobss telephone
number he would cut her in on the
profit and they both did very well a
clever bird indeed but i believe we
can put a fast one over on him we
are going to sell him some liquor

   how will that get our money
back i demanded

   leave that to your uncle replied
graves  come on were going to
see him now bring your gat-you
may need it

  we walked to mr jacobss establish-
ment which was only three blocks
away and came upon that oily gentle-
man in his tiny office where he was
ostensibly a loan agent he was ex-
pecting-its for graves had telephoned
and after grunting an acknowledgment
of introductions he waved us to chairs

 what iss it you want he asked
there was just the trace of an accent
in his soft voice  a loan perhaps
 no mr jacobs said graves
 weve got some very fine whisky
and we were told that you handle the
best stuff in new orleans its all in
barrels you can let it age as long as
you want to its a bargain twelve
barrels for twenty-five hundred bucks
so mr jacobs pursed his fat
lips and raised his thick black eye-
brows you will deliver it yess
nope we cant do that youll
have to come after it somebody
might relieve us of it on the way they
will know better than to touch you
jacobs laughed

  quite right he said well if
jour stuff iss good i can use it i will
bring a truck and take a look to-
morrow night give me the address

  graves wrote the street number on a
piece of paper and we departed when
we were outside graves snorted and
said

   can you imagine that old buzzard
wanted us to deliver it so he could
stick us up he wont dare to try to
storm our own joint though

  apparently if he had any thought of
robbing us mr jacobs had forgotten
it by the following evening for he ap-
peared at our storage place with one
man and a small truck graves
took him down to the basement and
they went from barrel to barrel while
the wily bootlegger tasted the contents
of each

   very good he cried when he had
finished  i can use them remem-
ber if you get any more like this
jacobs is the man i will always give
you a fair price and i know enough to
keep my tongue between my teeth
we helped roll out the barrels and
place them in the truck jacobs passed
over the money held out his hand
graves shook it and they rattled away

   did it breathed graves when the
machine turned the corner  trimmed
him and trimmed him good lord
what a yarn this will be for rum
row jacobs the smartest guy in
town buys one barrel of good whisky
for twenty-five hundred plasters oh
boy itll be good for a laugh ten years
from now

   one barrel i objected  it
looked like twelve to me

   twelve barrels corrected graves
 but only one barrel of whisky i was
a week getting those things made each
one had a false bottom was just the
right amount of wood for weight the
whisky is  top there is nothing but
wood below it took exactly one bar-
rel of the best stuff money could buy to
fill those barrels do you see the
light

  i	did and i enjoyed the joke nearly
as much as graves did it was a real
accomplishment  we had most of
our money back plus the very real


detective fiction weekly

satisfaction of having put one over on
our ancient enemy by the next day
the story was all over the city and ail
the rum kings hi-jackers and sea cap-
tains were talking about it the
righteous mr jacobs was said to be
three times as angry as a rattlesnake in
august bascoms reaction to our little
joke was not made public

chapter v

hooch war

we soon forgot the incident under
the stress of protecting and ex-
panding our own interests
from this point on wre grew rapidly
we acquired additional capital from
an attorney who was a pillar of his
church but who was not above invest-
ing five thousand dollars in what looked
like a sure thing

  our syndicate continued to buy from
the independent skippers and in a few
months we were taking nearly every-
thing they could bring in if our mar-
ket got much larger we might be hard
put to till the demand i mentioned
this to graves and he countered by
buying a small power boat which he
put under the command of shady
smith

  there are two kinds of ocean-going
rum runners you know the ships
which are owned by syndicates and
which run in close to shore are under
one classification while the boats
which lay outside the twelve mile limit
and wait for customers come under the
other these latter ships are usually
owned by their skippers who do not
care to take chances of losing their
craft by running the blockade they
prefer to loaf along out of the reach of
the coast guard cutters until somebody
comes along to buy and unload their
cargoes it was to meet these latter
boats that graves made his purchase

   it was at this stage of things that we
began to meet the grafters wre were
just getting big enough to merit their
attention naturally there were some

spots where we were more than will-
ing to make an investment in protec-
tion but for the most part we turned
down the proposals of the petty of-
ficials and peanut politicians graves
was hardboiled about it too

   you cant do us any good he told
them  and we wont pay you a dime
if you think you can make it tough for
us step right out and try it two
can play at that game

  we had one or two influential gentle-
men on our pay roll in new orleans
we also kicked in to three or four con-
stables on the road north and we con-
tinued to pay the st louis gangster
who delivered the goods for us in his
territory until the government sent him
to leavenworth for being so indiscreet
as to rob the united states mails

  however while we did not pay out
a great deal as we went along we al-
ways knew where money would square
almost anything except murder

  graves and i made it a rule to play
ball with our friends if they helped
us we helped them there was not
anything within reason that we would
not do to assist the boys who were in-
strumental in making our game a suc-
cess there was no sentiment at-
tached to it we knew that it was
good business that it would pay real
dividends in the future-and we in-
tended to be rum runners for some
time to come

  an example of the way we worked
there was a prosecuting attorney in
missouri who had made it very easy
for our trucks to run through his
countr despite all kinds of opposi-
tion he had used political pressure to
force the sheriff and his deputies to let
us alone election time was drawing
near the prosecutor was under fire
from his opponent and in several of
the newspapers it looked as though
he was certain to be defeated for re-
election he came to new orleans
and appealed to graves for assistance

   go back home said graves  and
defend your record in a few speeches

i d
the roaring road



bring the bootlegging issue up get
them to talking about it as soon as
some politician or newspaper demands
to know why you havent made war on
the rum runners send me a wire ill
do the rest

  the wire came a week later graves
loaded up an old truck with some odds
and ends of whisky and alcohol which
we had in one of our warehouses he
started it north in charge of two of
our men

  then he called the prosecutor on
the telephone and in a guarded con-
versation gave him his instructions

  the next night the prosecuting at-
torney single-handed seized a whiskv-
laden truck as it passed through his
town in a battle with the desperadoes
-according to the local newspapers-
more than twenty shots were fired
both men escaped but the whisky was
the prosecutors prize it was poured
into the sewer with appropriate cer-
emonies and plenty of photographers
when the ballots were cast and counted
our friend had been returned to office
with a record-breaking majority and
our rum trucks continued to roll
past the courthouse every night

   thats the way to do it said
graves  now if nothing happens in
st louis new orleans louisville or
kansas city we are all set to make
that million dollars in mighty short
order

  it developed that graves was a bit
optimistic we had a long way to go
and the road was to be rather rocky

  i was sitting in the leather company
office discussing ways and means with
shady smith when the door was
thrown open and in walked hurd the
man who gave us our first job in the
whisky game we had always been
friendly with him in fact we had
effected a sort of a combine to present
a more united front against the raids
of bascom and his hi-jackers

   howdy gents said hurd  i
come as the bearer of sad tidings
brother bascom has figured out a new

	d

one and if it works were out of
business

   aw sit down retorted smith
you musta been drinking your own
stuff how can bascom put us on the
bum

   just like this said hurd sitting
down and lighting a cigar  he has
served notice on all the independent
skippers that they will not be allowed
to sell to you fellows or to me if
they do he threatens to put his men in
boats and start raiding them most of
these lousy sea captains are scared to
death of bascom im afraid lies
going to make it tough he orders
them to sell to charley crouse they
get the same price why not save
themselves trouble see

   a sort of an embargo said i
were out crouse gets all the
business

   exactly

   say snarled smith  you
birds arent going to let him get away
with this are you 

  hurd shrugged

  how are you going to stop him
if he can bluff the skippers hes got
us on the pun

    ill bet graves wont stand for it
growled smith  well see what he
has to say

  graves had plenty to say but he
ref-used to fall in with smiths proposal
for a war to the finish with bascoms
crowd

   a waste of time and money he
declared  wre dont want a long
drawn-out fight if we can avoid it
this thing simply means that we will
have to do what we should have done
a long time ago we will go- into the
shipping end of this game too well
form a syndicate the three of us with
shares to a few outsiders then well
buy a boat or two hire our own cap-
tains and bring over our own booze in
the long run we will make twice as
much money as we make now

   but we take twice as many risks
objected hurd


detective fiction weekly

  risks shouted graves of
course therell be risksv this whole
game is made up of risks the fellow
that takes em is the fellow who col-
lects youve got to come in with us
in self-defense if you dont bascom
will break you

  hurd smiled

   i guess youre right he admitted
 ill get busy in the morning and
see if this is as bad as its supposed to
be went on graves  if it is ill
take steps to buy a ship and get a cap-
tain well meet here to-morrow at
noon and clean up the whole affair
ill show this bozo bascom a thing or
two about his own specialty

  what do you mean

    mean that i am going to organize
a crew of hi-jackers and rob bascom of
his stolen goods as fast as he gets em
watch me

  attaboy yelled smith i ap-
point myself chief hi-jacker

   shut up barked hurd  you
crazy guys will have us all in the gov-
ernments boarding house if you are
going to start a free-for-all battle you
can count me out im not afraid of
bascom but im not going to get
mixed up in a hooch war that wont
get us anyplace

   this wont be a hooch war said
graves  the first thing to do is to
get ourselves fixed up then we can take
care of bascom nice and quiet like
wrell just hoist his stuff and what the
hell will he do about it

   nothing answered smith

   and you better come in with us
hurd went on graves  or youll be
busted flatter than a pancake how
about it

   oh well declare me in but keep
your heads dont let that blood-
thirsty smith start a lot of shooting

   ill keep my head growled
graves  im in this business to make
the dough getting even with bascom
is incidental now you boys amuse
yourselves for the afternoon and ill go
out and talk turkey with the agents of

some of these yellow-livered skippers
if things are as bad as theyre cracked
up to be ill be back here this evening
with some real news see you then

  graves stalked out the three of us
went to limpys pay-off room in the
warehouse and played pitch for two or
three hours ate in an italian restaurant
and returned to the office to find
graves grinning like a donkey wait-
ing for us

   brother bascom has certainly put
the fix on the boys said he  all of
em ae scared pink wouldnt talk to
me said it wasnt even healthy to be
in the same neighborhood we cant
buy one dimes worth of liquor from
the boats but we should worry i
bought a boat remember the old
romolda well shes ours and-

   that old tub yelled hurd  why
the lousy scow wont hold together for
one trip

  yes she will and one trips all we
need if we lose her we wont be in so
deep anyway ive bought her and
ive got cagle for a skipper guess
that isnt good eh

  captain cagle was the toughest sea-
going man on the new orleans water
front a man-breaker and a man-
driver who was feared and hated
wherever he was known he had a rep-
utation for square dealing that was
something unusual among the motley
army of double crossing cheaters who
made up the rum rings queer tales
were whispered about the wharves
about cagle it was said that he was
a madman bloody yarns were told
of how he had beat off and sunk a boat
manned by hi-jackers how he had sub-
dued a mutinous crew and had thrown
-some of the members to the sharks

   cagle is a good man said hurd
 hes tough as leather but he is 
the level if anybody can bring that
old mudboat of yours into port its
cagle where are you going to get a
crew

   the captain is picking them re-
torted graves  hes making the
the roaring road



rounds of the joints now expects to
have all hands ready by to-morrow
noon

   now heres the lay of the land
one of us birds will have to go to cuba
and buy the cargo the other two can
stay here make plans for landing the
stuff and take care of bascom wholl
make the trip

   id like to go said i  im a
sailor i could probably help out if
anything happens

   wouldnt mind going mvself said
hurd

  graves laughed then said

   well draw the fellow that gets
the short piece of paper takes the ride

chapter vi

where bootleg liquor grows

went to a party the other night
the host one of those amiable busi-
ness men-fat florid and forty-
was very proud of his private stock
for my benefit he went down into his
basement and brought up an assort-
ment of bottles covered with fancy
labels he exhibited them proudly
extolling the virtues of each

   the best stuff money can buy
said he no bootleg liquor for mine
i get this direct from the fellow who
runs it in he charges me plenty but
its worth it here taste this

  he uncorked a bottle of scotch and
poured out two generous drinks we
downed it the stuff was passable
but that was all i recognized it im-
mediately it had never seen scot-
land it was from cuba perhaps
my own syndicate had brought it in

  my host hypnotized by the beautiful
labels actually believed that he was
drinking first-class liquor

  there are thousands of persons like
him in this country to-day they suf-
fer in more ways than one from the
belief that any kind of liquor brought
in on a boat is naturally good liquor
nothing could be further from the
truth a fine label which sets forth
that a bottle contains scotch rye bour-
bon or gordon gin means no more
than a fine dress upon a handsome
woman the drinkers let their eyes
deceive their stomachs

  let me make this point here and
now

     there is very little real liquor in the
   united states the warehouse whisky
   is diluted the moonshine is poison and
   the stuff which is run in from south
   america and cuba is of un inferior
   grade the man who tells you he is
   selling you real whisky gin or cham-
   pagne is a liar practically speaking
   there is no such animal

  when prohibition came along and
created another giant industry those
bent on violating the law went to eng-
land france and scotland for their
goods but it was a long and expensive
trip the profits did not compensate
the runners for the risk and then
as the available liquor supply in the
united states was consumed the
drinkers became less particular some
of them took to hair tonic others
drank one-day old moonshine any-
thing that had a kick in it was market-
able so said the bootleggers to them-
selves why should we give these peo-
ple real whisky when they will drink
something half as good and where
they asked themselves can we manu-
facture the stuff without interference
from the law

  cuba provided the answer and cuba
took this new industry to her heart
now nearly all of the booze consumed
in the united states is made there
hundreds of distilleries have sprung
up the stuff is turned out over night
it is about half as good as the cheap
whisky of other days bottles are
decorated with counterfeit labels and

liquor supposedly from all points of
the compass is made to order for the
rum rings and the american public
which has lost its sense and itshaste
drinks the stuff and likes it

  the base for most all the varied
liquors manufactured in cuba is the
same-alcohol made from sugar cane
it is easily and quickly produced and
sells for from twenty-five to thirty-five
cents a gallon the same gallon of
alcohol in chicago st louis or kansas
city costs from twelve to fourteen
dollars

   i had no idea of the immensity of the
trade when i arrived in havana with
captain cagle we docked at a wharf
which had been constructed for rum
ships and which we had reserved by
cable then we left the boat took a
taxicab and went to the office of one
of the hundreds of brokers who made
a business of supplying the wants of
american skippers

    i think ill take you to jensen
said cagle  hes honest and will give
you a good price

   okay with me said i cagle had
won my confidence on the trip across
he was a peculiar man tall lean sun-
burned with thick black hair and shin-
ing dark eyes his high cheek bones
bespoke the indian blood which un-
doubtedly coursed in his veins

  we went to jensen he was a huge
square-faced tow-headed swede who
greeted me with a grin and a bone-
crushing handshake

   we want a load said cagle  i
think about forty-five hundred cases
will do the trick what have you got 

   everything i can give you what-
ever you want look over the price list
while i transact a little business in the
inside office he handed me a printed
sheet and left hurriedly

  together we examined the list

  jensen like most of the cuban
brokers featured scotch whisky and
he had a large assortment of the stuff
in his warehouses the price list on
scotch was as follows  peter daw-

son -case-fifteen dollars haig and
haig case-twelve dollars lawson
case-twelve dollars and fifty cents
house of lords case-six dollars and
fifty cents old smuggler case-six
dollars and fifty cents

  for american and canadian whisky
he had hill and hill at five dollars and
fifty cents a case green river at five
dollars and fifty cents a case and wil-
liam penn at fifteen dollars a case he
also listed apricot cherry and peach
brandies at ten dollars a case cognac
at seventeen dollars and fifty cents a
case benedictine at twenty-two dollars
a case and all kinds of wine

  when jensen returned i told him
that we would take two thousand cases
of scotch a thousand cases of ca-
nadian a thousand five-gallon tins of
alcohol and five hundred cases of
mixed brandies

    righto he cried

  the order was made out and handed
to one of his assistants who hurried
away with it

  when can we get loaded asked
cagle

    well start right away said jen-
sen  itll all be in your hold by late
to-morrow afternoon you can bring
the money here to-morrow now that
we have business off our minds lets
go into my office and take a shot

   in the private office jensen unlocked
a desk and produced a bottle and three
glasses

   this actually came from scot-
land he said  when i first got into
this game i ran a boat load of scotch
in here to be used as flavoring for some
of this synthetic stuff ive still got
enough of it left for my own needs
well heres how

  we sat and talked and drank
through the warm lazy afternoon
across from jensens office were two
of the largest liquor wharves in cuba
and from the window i could see the
thousands of cases of liquor piled up
and awaiting ships to take them to the
united states trucks were arriving
the roaring road



constantly from the warehouses dis-
gorging more booze for thirsty amer-
icans beyond  the wharves were
dozens of ships lying in to get their
cargo fishing smacks schooners with
auxiliary engines several small steam-
ers and a beautiful high-powered
yachtlike affair with guns fore and aft

  prohibition what a joke it was
what a comedy hundreds of men
fighting scheming killing to get liquor
to thousands of other men and women
who had passed a law declaring it a
crime to sell or drink it six dollars
a case in st louis six dollars
wouldnt buy one bottle

  jensen was talking telling of his ex-
periences

   four years ago you couldnt sell
this synthetic booze for love or
money he was saying  now you
can sell every bottle you can lay your
hands on and the distilleries are going
full blast thats because the supply
in the states has fallen away off
there isnt any more good stuff and
the drinkers will stand for this phony
scotch made out of sugar cane alcohol
so why not give it to em

   all you have to do is to preserve
the illusion ifvyou labeled your bot-
tles  cuban whisky made from sugar
cane there isnt a rum runner in new
orleans or miami that would look at
you but if you put on a phony scotch
or canadian label its fine thats
why havana has one of the biggest
printing plants you ever saw devoted
to printing bum labels for our booze
the engravings are made by workmen
employed by the distillery owners

   it reminds me of tbe time the boot-
leggers complained that we were mak-
ing our whisky cases out of cuban
wood they kicked like mules said
the customers were getting hep to the
fact that the hooch was synthetic we
had to give in now all the whisky
cases made in cuba are made out of
wood which is sent over here on a
schooner theres a big load of it out
there right now can you beat that

   wthat about the bottles i asked
 oh theyre imported too no
facilities here for making them and
they wouldnt measure up the old
customer who drinks this stuff insists
on being fooled he knows hes a
sucker but he wont admit it

   say if a fellow could get control
of one of these distilleries along with
a distribution organization in the
states he could make a fortune so fast
hed be dizzy he could make this
stuff for a few cents a bottle and the
net profit would be something tre-
mendous too many people handle
this stuff now each one gets a cut
out of it

   you may hear from me on that
said i  my partners got big ambi-
tions in that direction if we can get
the capital we may do something soon
 i could swing a fourth interest in
a plant said jensen how about
you cagle want in  you could be the
commodore of our fleet

  cagle shook his head

   no the sea is all i know im
afraid im too old a dog to get mixed
up in anything new sometimes i wish
i had the nerve and the ambition to
step out and make a lot of money but
i havent

  jensen laughed

   sounds funny- he commented
when a guy like you talks about
nerve youre supposed to have plenty
of it

   only in one way replied cagle
 ive got the nerve to fight a gang of
drunken sailors but i cant burn all
my bridges behind me and become a
rum runner i can command a ship
that carries booze but i hang onto a
shred of respectability by pretending
that i am just the messenger queer
perhaps but thats the way i feel
about it

  the conversation languished pres-
ently cagle and i departed promising
to return to-morrow for another chat
before we sailed for home we strolled
down the dock and watched the yawn-

ing holds being fdled with cuban
liquor at the romolda an escalator
rattled and banged as the tins of alco-
hol were shot into the ship one of
jensens checkers stood near by keep-
ing tab on the cargo as it was loaded

    it  all be in by to-morrow noon
he said  we were short on scotch
and had to have some made up before
we could fill the order

   then we can leave by two oclock
said cagle  to-night well go see
the scratcher

  the scratcher whos he

   youll see when we get there

  we dined at a hotel and returned to
the water front after dark cagle led
the way down a narrow evil-smelling
street he stopped in front of a house
and pushed the bell-button which was
set in the wall a panel in the door
was opened cautiously and a pair of
eyes gleamed in the gloom

   ah captain exclaimed a voice
 come in it has been some time
since we have seen you

   it has that said cagle is the
boss in henry

   he is hell see you in a minute
will you sit down here and have a
drink

  henry brought the drinks and van-
ished when he returned he announced
that his employer was ready for us
and we stepped into the next room
a man tall lean with narrow droop-
ing shoulders sat behind a mahogany
desk which was littered with papers
before him was a row of pens at his
elbow were dozens of ink bottles be-
hind him stood a drawing board on an
easel

  he looked up as we entered and i
was struck immediately by his face
which was deadly pale and the burning
darkness of his eyes

   hello captain

  when introductions had been accom-
plished cagle plunged into the object
of our visit		 

   want some papers scratcher he
began  need them by to-morrow i

have to get out of here in a hurry and
i knew you wouldnt turn me down
you can get them out by morning for
me cant you

   ive got a lot ahead of me re-
plied the scratcher  and my hand isnt
as steady as it used to be my eyes
are bothering me cap im afraid im
going to have some trouble

   rubbish snorted cagle  youre
looking better than ever how about
it can i drop around again in the
morning

  the scratcher smiled wearily

   ill start in right now what do
you want the usual stuff honduras
and new orleans

  yes the price will be the same
i suppose

   the same old three hundred

  we took our leave and as wre walked
back toward the hotel the captain told
me what it was all about every ship
engaged in international trade must ob-
tain clearance papers before leaving a
port the papers set forth the name
of the ships owners home port the
cargo and the destination captain
cagle had arranged to buy two sets of
forged papers one showing our desti-
nation to be honduras and our cargo
to be liquor the second showing that
we were running into new orleans
without cargo

   then if wre are boarded at sea by
a revenue cutter i show em the hon-
duras papers he explained  theres
nothing they can do but let me alone
and after we unload our stuff i toss
the honduras manifest overboard and
use the others to get into new orleans
with its the best scheme yet devised
for protection from the prohis

   thats one bill that i always pay
myself that three hundred for the
phony papers and i figure that it is well
worth the money may keep me out
of the pen some day

   this scratcher is an expert 

   the best in the business

   oueer-looking fellow queer com-
plexion and funny-looking eyes
the roaring road



  cagle laughed grimly

   hes a sleigh rider you know
sniffs coke made a fortune writing
papers for booze hustlers and has spent
every dime of it on snow

chapter vii
the hi-jackers attack

the old romolda her insides
bulging with liquor rolled like a
drunken man as she fought her
way toward the states through great
green seas the sky was dark with
gray storm clouds and the howling
wind tore masses of foam from the
tops of the waves and hurled them at
the ship

  no need to ask whether the glass
rose or fell with such a wind shrieking
about us we were in for a hard light
and the success or failure of our ven-
ture depended upon the ability of this
old hooker to pound her way through
the vast stretch of tumbled waters
tossed and tormented by the gale boil-
ing and swirling as it smashed and
swayed to and fro

  i stood on the bridge with stilson
the first officer

   looks bad said i

   rotten he retorted bitterly
 this dirty old tub will be mighty
lucky if she gets through a sea like
this

  the day wore on the romolda
struggled and fought a huge mass of
water swept over her forecastle head
and crashed against the upper bridge
wrenching the lifeboats from their
davits

  from aft there came a hoarse
shout-

   engine room skylights carried
adrift

  the romolda moaning and groan-
ing in every rivet rose slowly on the
crest of a great wave and slid down
into the trough

  on the after well-deck members of
the crew struggled with the ships can-
vas others not needed for the work

had taken refuge against the sea in
the wheelhouse

  as the romolda rolled on her side
a man broke from the crowd around
the sails shouting

  well sink were done well
never get ome we wont

  instantly the members of the crew
dropped their work and gathered in
knots muttering to themselves

   we ought to take to the boats

   theres a steamer on this lane
make cagle send an sos

  stilson was bawling orders cursing
and yelling for the men to get back on
the job

  suddenly cagle appeared dressed in
black oilskins one hand clung to the
shattered bridge rail the other
gripped a wicked-looking revolver

   back to work he roared menac-
ing them with the weapon  you
givens you dirty little cockney i
heard you squawking about not getting
home one more word out of you and
your home will be some sharks belly
step lively

  sullenly the men -returned to their
duties

   a rotten gang said cagle to me
 theyd scuttle the ship and take to
the boats in a minute

  all night long the booming gale held
us in its grip we rolled and pitched
through the savage darkness now in
the depths of despair and certain that
the next minute was our last and again
riding high and hoping for the best
the wheelhouse was smashed the
boats ventilators and davits were so
much wreckage and still the romolda
hammered ahead her broken nose
pointed toward new orleans cagle
never left his post by the binnacle
light his face showed up thin and
cruel but his eyes were the eyes of a
man who would never surrender

   get us through and ill see that
youre taken care of i told him

  the captain smiled grimly

   i never lost a ship to a storm he
said  and i never lost a cargo to a


detective fiction weekly

hi-jacker thats about all ive got to
be proud of

  by morningthe gloom had lifted
the wind veered off the glass began
to rise we knew that the worst of
the gale was over we were safe with
our precious load of liquor

  all the next day we made good prog-
ress the wreckage was cleared away
the upper structure was patched

   the old scow stood up pretty well
said cagle  shes good for another
trip or so if she doesnt run into more
bad weather

  sunset found us skirting the coast
the watch was doubled to keep an eye
out for coast guard cutters and whisky
pirates cagle and his officers wore
automatics and sawed-off shotguns
were placed in handy places where fhey
could be reached by the crew in case
we were boarded

   well run for it if we can ex-
plained cagle but if they corner us
theyll get a hot reception

  when darkness came we nosed in-
shore without a light burning from
time to time the engines were shut
down while the captain listened intently
for the throbbing engines of a pursuer
hearing none we proceeded cagle
knew every foot of the way and lie
steered the craft without difficulty the
channel was wider now almost the size
of a small lake

   must be about here muttered
cagle to himself with a flash light he
consulted the written instructions
which graves had given him before we
sailed then he ordered the motors
shut down holding the flash light be-
fore him he turned it off and on four
times

   watch he said

  we strained our eyes peering into
the darkness from far away toward
the shore came the answering winks
of light-four times

 okay said stilson  theyve
spotted us and the coast is all clear
twenty minutes later a small power
boat came alongside and shady smith

sang out his greeting from the dark-
ness

  all ready he cried lets get
going

  another boat was in his wake and
presently three others appeared the
work of unloading the ship began
all hands including the negro cook
turned to cagle and i got into smiths
boat which was the first to make the
run for shore we wanted to see
graves i was hungry for news of
new orleans and the rum kings

   looks like weve made it i said
to cagle

    looks like it but dont be too sure
youve got a long way to go yet

   right said i

  as we neared the sandy beach i
could make out a knot of men gathered
there they came toward the water to
meet us gravess bulky figure loomed
above his companions

   as the boat ran its nose into the sand
our shouted greetings were stilled by a
shriek of terror from behind the dense
undergrowth which lined the shore
then a crowd of milling fighting men
crashed through the brush and came
toward us

  gravess face was a white mask of
fury

   bascom he bellowed  bascoms
gang has jumped our truck drivers
come on

  we leaped from the boat and joined
in the fray it was too dark and the
quarters were too close for the use of
firearms knives clubs and fists were
the only effective weapons there was
scant time before the whole mad mob
was upon us and we were at handgrips
with the professional bullies hired by
bascom

  there was the scuff of sand the
gasps and howls of men the thud of
terrific blows now the melee sloshed
calf deep into the sea now they were
on the sand swinging kicking biting
in primitive combat

  graves fought with the end of a
smashed whisky case knocking his as-
the roaring road



sailants right and left blood stream-
ing from a great gash in his forehead
cagle dour and silent used his fists
and struck like a sharpshooter making
every blow count every time he
lashed out with those terrible hands
a man went down

    my side was numb from a blow that
  i did not remember my nose bled
  freely using both hands on a rifle
  which i had picked out of the boat
  i cleared a space around me then
  picked out a big hulking ruffian and
  cracked his skull as i did so another
  man dived for my legs and brought me
  down in the shallow water rolling
  - over to extricate myself from his
  grasp i almost drowned before i got
  to my feet again a blow with the
  barrel of the rifle ended the fellow who
  had tackled me and i returned to the
  fight

    in the meantime the second boat
  came ashore and we were strengthened
  by ten men enough reenforcement to
  make the contest more equal slowly
  we drove the attacking force back to-
  ward -the underbrush and then as sud-
  denly as they had appeared they broke
  and ran for cover

    now bawled graves give it
  to em

    shady smith was ready his auto-
  matic rifle chattered its song of death
  and bullets sang about the heads of the
  fleeing hi-jackers as they fled into the
  darkness

     thats enough said graves  let
  em go lets make speed with the
  loading

    the fight was over not a man en-
  gaged in it had gone unscathed graves
  had suffered a scalp wound cagles
  face was a mass of beaten and bruised
  flesh smith was covered with blood
  several of the truck drivers were un-
  conscious but none of them was seri-
  ously hurt a broken arm seemed to
  be the worst of it

    my side pained fearfully one of
  my eyes was closed my jaw ached
  the whole world seemed to be sliding

about me crazily as i walked toward
the lineof trucks

   youre about all in said graves
 youre white as a sheet better go
in on the first truck come  ill fix
it with the driver

  he conducted me to a machine an
oil truck with a false end which could
be taken out to make rodm for liquor
and said to the driver

  take this fellow in to the station
hes all right

  a few minutes later we were rolling
down the dark road toward new or-
leans

  i had a sawed-off shotgun across
my knees i was earning my ride by
acting as guard

   wonder how they got wise to us 
i asked

   dunno said the young driver
 bascom paid somebody for the tip i
guess they tried to stick us up then
they were going down to the beach
grab you fellows and take what hooch
they could get but we wouldnt be
stuck up there was about a dozen of
us and we just jumped right out in
the middle of em and the whole gang
of us rolls down to the beach fighting
like mad he laughed at the memory
of the battle

    boy this is a fighting business if
you dont fight you dont last won-
der if smith clipped any of those boys
when they beat it for the brush he
was layin down on em pretty heavy

  we passed through several dark and
silent villages and headed toward st
bernard the young truckman was
peering anxiously into the gloom

   things look right to-night he
said  no signs of hi-jackers or dry
agents

  we rattled through st bernard and
turned north to poydras as we did
so a speeding sedan came from behind
tore past us and came to a halt about
fifty yards down the road two men
leaped out and hurried toward us i
raised my weapon

   keep your shirt on said the


detective fiction weekly

driver  they may be a couple of the

boys

  both men were heavily armed but
they made no motion to draw the pis-
tols which were strapped on the outside
of their garments

   whats your number called one
after they stopped at a discreet dis-
tance

   sixty-nine said the driver

   whats the word

   red roses

   get rollin to town

  the men stood aside and we pro-
ceeded on our way

   what was all that  i demanded

   dunno myself guess this mob
im workin for has got the business
on this road sewed up they put out
numbers and passwords and if you
aint got em its just too bad for you
if we hadnt been right chose two birds
would have started shootin

   you see the guy that runs this out-
fit is no sucker he aint going to buy
protection for a lot of stiffs to muscle
in on his game sec

  i saw and marveled at what graves
had accomplished in the short time that
i had been in cuba with the help of
ilurd no doubt he had provided for
the safe landing and transportation of
our goods into the city

  but there were other surprises in
store for me when we arrived in
town we drove to a long low building
which looked like a factory or a garage
as we approached two wide doors
swung open and we drove into the place
which was lined with trucks of every
description in one end of the room
cases of liquor were piled high and
there was a complete bottling capping
and labeling outfit

  when graves arrived an hour later
he took great delight in showing me
around the new establishment

   safe as a church he explained
 ive got it all fixed we can haul our
stuff here and start it north ive fig-
ured out that we can make about twen-

to be c

ty per cent more profit by buying alco-
hol in cuba shipping it here and mak-
ing it into synthetic whisky

    thats why i bought all the equip-
ment and look at this- he pointed
to a big tank with a huge faucet at
the bottom

    this is the best rig yet when you
get the stuff in the case you tuck in
a lot of straw then you shoot the whole
works under the faucet and give it a
dose of salt water when the old cus-
tomer opens his case he gets a whiff
of that salt water and he says  the
real stuff right off the ocean and
youve made a customer for life

  we sat for an hour making high
plans for the future  told graves
about jensen and his scheme for buy-
ing an alcohol plant

   great idea he said  it would
give us a complete production and dis-
tributing outfit but the first thing we
want to do is to buy a couple of real
ships well sell the romolda and get
a line on something worth while then
well put cagle in charge of the fleet
and well run the stuff and count the
money

   now theres one thing thats got
to be done right away the business
is so big in kansas city and st louis
that weve got to have more storage
room and more men on the job up
there suppose you look after it all
right 

    im ready to go

   want to go now 

    sure

   fine said graves  you can
ride up with the boys when they take
the first of this stuff up theyll be
ready to start in an hour come on
over ill introduce you to henry the
bos driver

   just as the first gray tinge of dawn
was touching the sky the booze trucks
rolled out of the plant and headed
north i sat on the front seat beside
the square-jawed henry a repeating
shotgun across my knees

murder at the locust

on the night of the murder the
night clerk at the locust apart-
ments saw the side door open
and three men come in they were
supporting mr skeets brady the
clerk said afterward when common-
wealth versus jordan came up for
trial that brady appeared to be drunk
no he was not close enough to smell
liquor but he knew a drunk when he
saw one and brady had spoken of
attending a dooners birthday party
which from what the clerk had heard
meant a party wringing wet

  yes brady had been a permanent
guest he lived on the same floor as
whitey higgins the men had taken
brady upstairs accompanied by a bell-
boy who had a pass key

    then the three went to higginss
  room the bellboy had told him so and
  he knew them as his friends higgins
  had arrived and gone up to his apart-
  ment about fifteen minutes earlier in
  a minute or so he phoned down and
  asked for ginger ale the same bell-
  boy took it up

    then went on the night clerk floss
  jordan rushed in and demanded ex-
  citedly is mr brady in the
  clerk stalled for time but she de-
  manded the key her breath was
  heavy with the sweet redolence of
  flavored alcohol could he smell it
  he eould but he had not thought it
  unusual miss jordan was bradys
  girl she had also been at the party and
  he gave her the key she was yelling for
  brady had said she could have it in his
  absence why not therefore when he
  was at home

  two minutes later-the clerk said it
was exactly twenty minutes after two
-she came flying down the stairs and
through the lobby he noticed that
her hat was askew and that she was
very pale she went out and he
thought he saw her getting into a cab

  was he sure about the cab not
exactly because at that moment the
poker game was telephoning for more
ginger ale and at the same moment
some one else came flying up to him
but this time it was the bellboy whis-
pering wildly  say listen bradys

  captain ryan and his assistant
wtood answered in person because
this looked like the latest of a series of
gangster killings that had aroused the
newspapers almost to frenzy all pre-
vious arrests had achieved only new
editorials wounded gangsters had
died with buttoned lips and suspects
had managed to squirm out but ryan
arrested floss within an hour lodged
her in a citv hall detention cell and
iiad her finger-printed the first thing in
the morning

  the finger-prints were identical with
those on the revolver found by bradys
body but she refused to say a word
at ryan wood or brown the as-
sistant district attorney whose spe-
cialty was murder she only shrugged

   you know whatll happen to you
if you dont talk they said

   i wont talk she answered

   well said rvan  how about
those waiters at a dooners party that
heard you scrappin with the boy
friend  how about them hearing you
say you were gonna kill him how
about that huh

   well what about it she retorted

  why did you say it

   i was sore at him thats all

   why did you follow him home
when you knew he was drunk

   say listen she said putting her
knuckles on her hips  who had a
better right to follow him home

   have you talked to higgins
lately 

   i wouldnt spit -on higgins she
said sweetly

   you used to be higginss girl be-
fore you were bradys werent you
put in brown

   well cant a girl make a mistake 
  didnt higgins give you the air
   i just took it

   so you took up with brady

   well-yes

   higgins didnt mind did he

   nobody cared if he did

   higgins ever try to get you back 
  she was silent shrugging

  after they left her brown said to
ryan theres a story around that she
and higgins made it up and laid for
brady youd better check up on
where higgins was last night

   i did said ryan  and its all
o k thats what makes me sure she
did it brady didnt cheat himself on
dames no matter how he cheated on
them an that jordan babys no lamb-
stevv and lilies im givin it out to the
papers shes gonna get the works im
goin back to bradys

  as he entered the- locusts lobby a
tall gaunt unshaved individual whose
battered stetson hung like a cloud over
his hawks beak laid a hand on his
shoulder it was arthur beele crime
reporter for the telegraph that hat
and that beak had followed every mur-
der of consequence since the day that
gyp the blood dago frank and lefty
louie had made themselves a part of
the history of crime

   so youve made a pinch eh
ryan

  there was that in beeles nasal
greeting which always made ryan ap-
prehensive he looked up at him
the silent witness



 oh-hello arty thats right got
the goods on her too

   nice work said beele  youre
getting better all the time ryan
ryan did not answer they walked
up the stairs to bradys aparament on
the second floor the door was locked
but one of ryans men opened it the
body lay on the couch awaiting removal
to the morgue everything else had
been left as it was the night before

   when is doc smythe going to
make his autopsy asked beele

   say arty why are you always
tryin for individual information
ryan demanded  cant you wait
until the other boys get here from their
papers an then take it with them  you
always act like-

   hell ryan said beele sharply
 whats individual about that 

   oh i dont mind telling you its
some time this afternoon but dont
ask so many questions

  but beele was bending over the
body two bullet holes close to-
gether from which the blood had
bubbled slowly marked the white sheen
of the stiff shirt the eyes were open
beele examined the couch and the floor
around it

  you said last night there were three
bullets out of his rod ryan

   say how many times do you have
to be told demanded ryan truc-
ulently

   i was wrondering where the third
bullet hit him beele examined the
body more closely  here he said
 look ryan it grazed his shoulder
and buried itself in the frame of the
couch how many shots did the bell-
boy hear

   for the love of mike beele
whats eatin you cant you wait for
the other guys to get here to find out
the kid heard three shots whats all
this monkey business anyway you
always think you know it all three
bullets

   three shots she killed him an
there you are put that in the paper

and cut out this sherlock holmes
stuff

  beele shrugged  i like to get the
facts he said and began to wander
about the room ryan scowled at him

  there was a knock at the door
ryans man opened it to admit the
other reporters beele nodded to them
and continued his explorations yes
ryan began it looked very much as if
the girl had done it her threats
bradys other women the waiteys
the night clerk the bell hop three
shots three bullets her finger-prints
 the revolver he preened himself
as he talked and beeles long nose
drew down to sour mockery softly
he slid open the bureau drawer which
he had been fingering fumbled about
inside and took out something which
he slipped quickly into a handkerchief
in his pocket

   see you later ryan he said
 theres something i want to show
you

  ryan ignored him beele pulled his
hat down hard and went out with the
greatest possible haste he sought his
city editor

        chapter ii
        higginss alibi  

t tarrington he said as
jhj they retreated into a corner of
the local room  i think ive
got something

  harrington looked at him quizzi-
cally wearily a city editors life is a
dogs life a hound dogs life and he
and beele had worked together from
the beginning for a long long time

   what do you think about the case
artv 

    j

  do you want a hunch

  we cant print hunches

  beele fished a cigarette out of his
side pocket  ive never steered a
paper wrong yet and you know that
harry but youre right just the
same we cant print hunches he
expelled a cloud of smoke through one


detective fiction weekly

nostril  and yet i think shes in-
nocent and i think ill prove it
ive never let you down harry and
we havent scored a beat together since
--since when

  harrington sighed  there arent
any beats any more arty

   if we said the girl is innocent that
would be a beat wouldnt it if we
turned out to be right wed be sitting
on the world wouldnt we

   if said harrington

   lets do it beele said

   whats up your sleeve 

   its in my pocket

  for a moment harrington looked
at him then he said  weve been
out of jobs before and i guess we
will again but theres a typewriter
and the office is lousy with copy paper
write that story go ahead dont
stare at me like a damn fool

  an hour later the first night extra
hit the street the telegraph de-
clared that floss jordan was a victim
of circumstances but who had made
those circumstances-and why did
the police think they could wipe clean
a record of past futilities by the arrest
of an innocent girl when there were
others with definitely established
motives for wanting the dead man out
of the way floss jordan was in-
nocent of bradys murder the police
being willing the telegraph would co-
operate with them in an effort to fix
the blame where it belonged

  there wras a picture of floss a pic-
ture which showed her a slip of a girl
with an uptilted chin and a big picnic
hat it was the kind of picture that
editors love readers adore and district
attorneys fear no newspaper reader
seeing that picture would ever believe
that a girl who looked like that could
ever kill a mouse much less a man it
looked exactly the picture of the poor
innocent young thing sacrificed for
somebodys honor or pocketbook and
arty beele with diabolical circumlo-
cution hinted so in eleven paragraphs
after all gangsters are no angels and

she was a gangsters girl two gang-
sters girl in fact and the make-up
man wrote under the picture  a face
a man could die for and the cir-
culation of the telegraph multiplied
like mayflies in may

  that night a slim young man whose
blond good looks would have distin-
guished him anywhere strolled into the
detective bureau and smiled genially
at the detectives in the outer room he
knew them all and he greeted them
like hail fellows in his way whitey
higgins was an ingratiating person

   the captain around woody 

   he want to see yon

    thats what i want to find out
wood shrugged  hes in there in-
dicating ryans private office  hes
talkin to arty beele

  yeh higgins too read the
telegraph he knocked at ryans
door and walked in

    want to see me captain 

   what about whitey

  higgins smiled slyly and gave beele
a look  why brady

  did you knock him off

    hellno

  know who did

  higgins shook his head  i just
came up here because the boys out-
side -he jerked his thumb toward
the outer room- they all know i was
after brady if somebody else hadnt
a done it i wouldve but i didnt
see what i mean

    just called to be sociable is that it
higgins said beele  just come in
to put your alibi on file eh  he gave
a tug at the battered stetson  where
were you a little after two last night
higgins

    plavin poker

   where

    in the apartment

  can you prove it

   higgins again smiled slyly  i guess
the captains done that already

   did you hear the shots whitey
 how could i help it  im on the
same floor aint i
the silent witness



   willing to testify to that

   sure any time

  why were you after brady

   you ought to know that without
askin he wras poachin in my terri-
tory we  had an agreement brady
and i did he was to keep out of
south philly i meet him in front of
the sylvania last week and i tell him
 brady youre workin the wrong side
of the street cut it out he said sure
hed cut it out and the same night
one of his trucks delivers a load of
beer on snyder avenue so thats
why id a got him if somebodv else
hadnt

   and if somebody else should hap-
pen to be the girl brady took awav
from you that wouldnt make any
difference either would it

  higgins lit a cigarette  im sorry
about the kid he said  its just
tough she had to get mixed tip with a
guy like brady but dont get it
wrong brady never took her away
from me you know how a guy gets
with a dame soon as she started
tryin to run me i smacked er down
told her i liked her all right but shed
better hit the breeze and try a change
of scenery so brady took her over
and if she killed him it serves him
right for trying to take over my ter-
ritory too

  you were at a dooners party
last night werent you said beele

   sure so were you arty a lot of
the newspaper crowd was there i
understand the captain here got an in-
vite too

  ryan scowled a dooner was a ris-
ing racketeer beele went on   and
brady was there and so was floss
listen higgins i saw how you kept
your eye on floss what did she and
brady fight about

   he was neckin with some other
dame-thats all i could see so she
got sore but thats the kind of rat
brady was never had enough-
money liquor women-	

   brady got drunk didnt he 

   and howr

   did he start home alone 

   i wasnt that interested arty
somebody did say he started to go
home with that dame hes been warmin
up but i couldnt say i was too
anxious to get back to the apartment
and play poker myself to worry about
that punk

  beele regarded him closely then he
said  what are you going to do for
floss

   what do vou mean-what can i
do

   take care of her see that she has
a lawyer dont you know that shes
held on suspicion of murder dont
you know that yet higgins 

  higgins looked undecided then he
took a sheaf of bills out of his pocket
 if a couple of grandll help ill come
through he handed beele two one-
thousand dollar notes  heres two
grand arty hell-heres another five
hundred get the kid a mouthpiece
anything else

  beele pocketed the money and shook
his head ryan said  hit the breeze
higgins f i want you ill send for

   k o with me higgins replied
and turned to go

  just a minute said beele  when
did you get that apartment on the same
floor as brady

business youd like to know

  beele considered  yes while im
at it and if you dont mind whitey

   sure anything to oblige hig-
gins slipped a colt automatic out of his
hip pocket and handed it to beele  its
a  if thats what youre after

the clip then snapped it back and re-
turned it to higgins  thats what
im after all right bradys was a 
smith  wesson thanks whitey

ryan cut in  leave that gat here

nerve an i got a mind to pinch

weapons

growled

  higgins left when the door had
closed behind him beele said  id

  ryan bridled  never mind tellin
me what to do and never mind ask-
ing me about it either cornin around
here suckin up information an goin
back an puttin me on the pan- he
picked up a copy of the telegraph
 where the hell do you get this stuff
anyway ive checked up on higgins
and hes not mixed up in it he an
floss had a fight and i know damned
well shes off him for life

   theres a mixture some place
beele replied calmly  i dont like its
smell and the better that blond
beauty frames his alibi the less i like
it now im asking you ryan do
you want me to work with you or
around you

   i want you to get out of here and
stay out

   all right if you feel that way

   because i say so

  beele pulled down his hat  ill talk
to her all right and no thanks to you
when will you learn ryan that it
takes more than a flat foot like you to
keep me from a story never said
beele answering his own question  cr
you wouldnt be the kind of flatty you
are

  ryan felt a familiar twinge of ap-
prehension he knew beele of old as
did the local rooms of a dozen cities
from new york to chicago  listen
arty he began in a conciliatory tone
but beele had opened the door and

ryan turned in time to meet it closing
quietly in his face

chapter iii
pop dinsmores case

on arch street facing the north-
ern wing of city hall stands a
row of once sturdy but now de-
crepit five-story buildings whose ten-
ants in view of many postponements
view with equanimity its perenially an-
nounced destruction henry kendall
dinsmore esq attorney and counsel-
lor-at-law whose offices occupied the
second floor front of  intended to
retire when the building was razed and
he said so as beele dropped his gaunt
frame into dinsmores favorite arm-
chair

   arty i know a place in maine
where-

   youre too rheumatic to fish any
more pop and youre too old to retire
come across with a drink and ill give
you a retainer he displayed one of
the thousand-dollar bills he had got
from higgins  like the looks of it
i know where theres another just like
it

  the old lawyer his little blue eyes
popping his tongue incapable of
speech slid open a desk drawer and
produced a bottle and glasses

   rye said beele

  dinsmore esq nodded then the
drink made him articulate

   its from judge grays stock how
dyou get a thousand arty hon-
estly

  beele threw the bill across the desk
 its good rye counsellor tell the
judge i said so yeah i got it hon-
estly what made you ask me do
i look like a lawyer 

  dinsmore stuffed the retainer into
his vest pocket and adjusted the wing
collar which encircled his heavily
fleshed neck dinsmores corpulence
his little marblelike blue eyes belied
him more than one jury had discov-
ered to their surprise and several of

 d
the silent witness	

the younger prosecuting attorneys to
their sorrow his rapacious brilliance
since beeles visits more often con-
cerned negotiations for a five-dollar
loan than the casual tossing over the
desk of thousand-dollar fees those eyes
now glittered zestfully

   whats the trouble arty

  no trouble pop just murder

   perpetrated or merely intended
   maybe both  dont know yet

   by whom

   the police say floss jordan know
who she is it doesnt matter but
the bad smell that assails my beezer
comes from a long-lashed blond boy
not unknown to the police his name
is higgins and the dead man is-
 brady of course im part of your
public arty

   anyway your client is dark and
petite and shes got eyes that can swim
in tears better than any youve ever
seen you wont have to tell her how
to act in court and shes even bet-
ter looking than her picture and with
all that pop shes a good kid-and
too damned good for the guys that
have had her youll enjoy defending
her

   why are you interested

   it doesnt matter much does it
said beele shrugging  but ive got a
luinch theres a story in it for me
dinsmore reached for his pipe
 how goods her case

   youll have to decide that yourself
after ive told you about it thats
why im paying you

   beele related the details of the previ-
ous night then dinsmore said  who
did you say is paying me

   higgins said beele quietly
 lets go over and talk to floss

  she wras sitting in her cell giving
herself a careless manicure when ryan
took them up

   hello mr beele come to bail
me out

    just to introduce you to your attor-
ney kid the jam youre in isnt bail-
able is it rvan

   d

    ill say it isnt come along arty
if mr dinsmore wants to talk to her

  dinsmore rising from his bow over
flosss hand said  mr beele is as-
sisting me in this case captain ryan
if you dont mind-he will continue to
do so thank you captain

  ryan turned grumbling to go

   thank you captain said beele
  wont eat your prisoner charming
as she is he waved ryan to the
door  read all about it in the paper
ryan then he turned back to floss
and dinsmore she was busy with
her orange stick

   floss said beele  if anybody at
all can get you out of this pop dins-
mores the one tell us just what hap-
pened did you plug him kid 

   i dont want to talk about it mr
beele im telling you now i dont
care what happens to me so dont pull
any soft stuff he was just like the
rest of them once they get a girl where
they want her the devil with the
whole works if they want to burn

   but my dear girl- dinsmore
started to say

   you heard me floss interrupted
 i mean it she flung down the
orange stick  its swell of you and
all that mr beele getting mr dins-
more for me i appreciate it all right
dont think i dont but-

   dont thank me kid beele said
 thank higgins hes paying for it
dinsmore noted approvingly how the
tears rushed to her eyes but beele
was pleased to see that they were tears
oftage she half rose  i dont want
him to pay for-for anything-for
me she was trembling now or
any other time after what he did to
me why-

   in that case said dinsmore
suavely  it would please me to repre-
sent you without fee miss jordan-if
you irill do me the honor

  she choked back a sob and did not
answer beele gave her a cigarette and
lit it for her


detective fiction weekly

   youve known me for some time
havent you floss since you came
to town and got a job as coat-room
girl at the old cyrano thats two
years now and you know that a lot
of people think im a pretty square
guy can you believe im playing
square with you when i ask you if you
werent pretty sweet on higgins once 
 everybody knows that she re-
plied  but i wised up

   and brady you sort of liked
him too didnt you

  she exhaled a ring of smoke it
floated slowly upward dissolving into
nothing

   i liked brady-at first i wouldnt
have gone to him if i hadnt but
these racket guys are all the same just
because they can flash a roll they think
they can have any girl or as many of
them as they want but that stuff
doesnt go with me

   like last night at the party

   sure she said

   floss havent you ever thought of
laying off these racket guys and tying
up with some regular fellow that could
give you a home and a radio and a pay
envelope on saturday night you
know what i mean-be regular your-
self and have a couple of kids-

   she flicked the ash off her cigarette
 forget it she said  i had my
chance and i muffed it it was just be-
fore i busted up with higgins the
kid was crazy about me and id known
him back home-before i came to
philly kid stuff you know we used
to go out in his brothers flivver and
neck in the moonlight then i run
smack into him on chestnut street and
he buys me a soda and wants to marry
me got a good job and the rest of it
but would he handle me now not
for a dime a dozen her tears this
time were not of anger

   whats his name  asked dins-
more	

  who cares and she was silent
again

   how the hell arty am i going to

defend her dinsmore said as they left
city hall  when she wont even talk 
to me  how are you going to help her
when she wont even talk to you  and
her finger-prints on the gat that killed
brady as plain as an engraving

   shell talk said beele  after
shes been in jail for a week and when
ive produced the kid sweetheart she
comes from phoenixville and thats
where ill find him but tell me pop
how does it look to you 

   it looks to me replied dinsmore

 that as long as she wont talk we
wont talk maybe its the best thing
after all well make em believe she
came in grabbed the gun got scared
and ran out we wont offer an- de-
fense let em prove she did it no-
body saw her shoot him just as you
say others-higgins for instance or
one of the lads that was with him
might have done it well make the
jury believe that-if we can if we
can arty well offer no defense at
all and let them get a good long look
at her good looks

   ilm-m they walked on toward
dinsmores office beele whistled a
lugubrious melody which if it sounded
like anything at all was reminiscent of
chopins  funeral march then as
they paused before  he said

 pop you think she did it dont you

   dont you dinsmore was mildly
surprised  admitting that higginss
mixed up in it somewhere do you real-
ly think shes innocent

  i do said beele lets get
straight in this if i-we-get her off
im entitled to all the story there is
all the story possible im a reporter
and i dont rescue maidens in distress
unless theres something in it for me-
and that means my paper ill let you
in on all i know already ill tell you
everything else as i find it out but
when she goes to trial-well its my
party and short of getting her con-
victed youll do as i say and get the
glory ok

   certainly arty ill get the glory

from judge lacey

chapter iv

witnesses for the defense

and so ladies and gentlemen of
 the jury said brown when
commonwealth versus jordan
came up a month later  the state will
show that the defendant had a motive
for killing brady and that she did in
fact kill him he lowered his voice
to conversational tones a favorite de-
vice  the commonwealth of penn-
sylvania is not vindictive it does not
seek vengeance as its instrument i
am not vindictive nor vengeful and
ladies and gentlemen of the jury
neither i know are you but the laws
by which you and i and the defendant
are governed say that floss jordan
cannot on the peril of her own life
take the life of another if she had a
grievanceagainst the deceased real or
fancied these very laws this very
court would have provided a remedy
but as i shall show she disregarded
these laws she killed i want yoit to
give the defendant when the time
comes for you to decide her guilt or
innocence the benefit of every doubt
but i ask you now if the evidence you
shall hear points unequivocally and un-
deniably to her guilt to act as men
and women who wish to see the law
upheld i shall ask you ladies and
gentlemen of the jury when the time
comes for me to do so for a verdict
of murder in the first degree

  brown bowed sat down and called
his first witness it was dr smythe
the coroners physician who took the
oath like a temperature

   dr smythe you are the coroners
physician are you not

   i am

   did you examine the body of the
deceased

   i did sir the deceased died of
two bullet wounds through the heart

  did vou extract the bullets

  i did

 brown held up three leaden pellets
  do these look like the bullets you
 extracted 

 smythe examined them  they look
 like thirty-eight caliber bullets i ex-
 tracted two of them there was a
 third wound a surface wound over the
 shoulder i did not find the bullet
 which caused it

  thank you doctor said brown
 resuming his seat and indicating by a
 wave of his arm that dinsmore could
 cross-examine

  no questions said dinsmore

 the commonwealths next witness
 was the head waiter at the club cy-
 rano where a dooner had given his
 party

  do you know the defendant 
 brown asked

  fairly well

  did you hear what she said to
 mr brady on the night of the rd of
 september

  i did

  what did she say 

 the head waiter paused for a second
 she said listen you two-timing
 skunk i dont give a damn if you take
 on every tramp in town when im not
 around but i wont go for it here get
 me 

  were those her exact words 

  pretty nearly

  and what did brady say

  he didnt say anything at first
 then floss-i mean the defendant-
 said something i couldnt hear she said
 it so low and brady turned around-
 not all around because some one was
 sitting in his lap-and told her to go
 back to higgins

  do you recall his exact words 

  as closely as i remember he said
  go peddle yourself to whitey deary
 youre no bargain 

  then what happened

  she started to cry i dont remem-
 ber just what she said but she did
 say she wouldnt take that from any-


detective fiction weekly

 body she said whitey was a wet
 smack but if he were half the man
 whitey was hed still be a louse and
 then she cried again and she said
 again she couldnt go for that stuff

   what did brady say then

    he said  go to hell deary 

   do you remember what happened
next

   i interfered i asked her to sit
down somewhere

   did she do so

   no

   what did she do

  she said you may think im
drunk charley but i know what im
saying and ill do it too im going
to kill that skunk if its the last thing
i ever do and she snatched up a bot-
tle of ginger-ale and started to bring
it down on bradys head i took it
away from her and then a dooner
came up and made her dance with
him

   were there any of the other wait-
ers near you when she threatened to
kill brady

   there were frank tetti and oscar
gantz

  your witness said brown turn
ing to dinsmore

  dinsmore pushed down his collar
do you mind if i call you char-
ley

  the witness smiled  youve al-
ways called me that mr dinsmore
 well charley how long have you
been a waiter

   seventeen years

   and a head waiter

   the last six years-ever since i
left the bellevue

   now charley in your business
you have found it necessary from time
to time to deal with people under the
influence of liquor have you not

   many times mr dinsmore

   i thought so so that in plain par-
lance you know a drunk when you see
one

  brown interposed an objection  i
fail to see your honor how mr dins-

mores attempt to qualify the witness as
an expert on alcoholization is within
the scope of my original examination
 the witness said dinsmore
 has testified that the defendant inti-
mated that he thought her drunk i
am about to ask him if she appeared to
be

   objection over-ruled said the
court

  dinsmore continued  charley was
brady drunk 

   oh yes

   was the defendant drunk

   verv drunk

    thats all charley

  brown then called tetti one of the
other waiters but before he could be
sworn dinsmore was on his feet
 your honor if it is the purpose of the
district attorney to prove by the next
witness and other witnesses that the de-
fendant threatened bradys life i sug-
gest in order to spare the patience of
the court and jury that the defense ad-
mit that the defendant threatened
brady ifit please the court the de-
fense admits that floss jordan threat-
ened to kill brady and more than that
had an actual jealous motive for kill-
ing him

   im satisfied said brown and
called the hotel clerk

  the clerks testimony passed un-
challenged more than that dinsmore
nodded approvingly and said to the re-
porters table  good witness has
anybody seen arty to-day

  nobody had nor had he been in
court they were curious but they
had more immediate concerns

  brown was putting the bellboy 
the stand he said his name was henry
collins that he had worked at the
locust for seven months and had been
on duty on the night of the twenty-
third of september

  brown asked him  did you have
occasion to enter mr bradys room
about twenty minutes after  a m 

    yessir

   tell the court and jury in your
the silent witness



own way the circumstances which led
you to enter his room and what you
discovered when you entered it

  it was evident with his first words
that collins had rehearsed his nar-
rative he told it tersely

   i took some ginger ale up to mr
higginss room then im coming
back and turning the corridor corner
when i heard three shots i noticed
that the door to bradys room was
open and when i went in there he was
on the couch with blood all over him
 dead prompted brown

   he looked dead to me

   collins said brown  was there
a revolver on the floor by the couch
 yessir

  brown held up a  caliber smith
and wesson revolver

   is this the one

    it looks like it

   thats all said brown turning
to dinsmore

   collins said dinsmore  when
you took the ginger ale up to higginss
room what was higgins doing

   objected to as irrelevant snapped
brown

  dinsmore looked grieved  i do
not wish to question the credibility of
this witness i pay him no compliment
when i say that his honest face im-
presses me however the district at-
torneys objection compels me to ques-
tion it if he can tell me what mr
higgins was doing when he entered his
room he can convince me that he really
entered it or may i ask the district
attorney whether he intends to call mr
higgins to corroborate the witness
brown growled inaudibly and the
court said  i think the witness may
answer the question

  well collins said dinsmore
 what was higgins doing dinsmore
held up one finger like a rotund school-
master

   he was playing cards collins re-
plied

  dinsmores finger dropped he
smiled approvingly his blue eyes very

bright and turned to the bench  i
 longer question the credibility of
this witness  make this remark your
honor for the record and for his ben-
efit  collins you delivered the ginger
ale to the poker game you took your
tip and departed and then you say
three shots ran out upon the still night
air is that right

   yessir

  now tell us collins did the shots
follow each other quickly like this
he gave three staccato raps with his
pencil

   no sir there was one shot i
stopped when i heard that and then
right before i turned the corner of the
corridor that bradys room was on
there were two more shots thats
when  smelled the powder i thought
at the first shot that it was the backfire
of some engine

   youre pretty sure about the shots
are you

   im pretty sure

   and was a revolver like the one
mr brown showed you on the floor
yessir

   and mr brady looked rather
dead eh

   he certainly did

   thats all collins thank you
dinsmore looked pleased

   captain john ryan brown called
out

  ryan walked to the stand with a dig-
nified tread took the oath and hung 
his cap on his knee as he prepared to
testify

   captain ryan- brown began
but stopped as beele walked down the
center aisle pausing for two seconds to
whisper to dinsmore and then sat
down beside floss jordan there was
a murmur at the press table and judge
brazleton looked inquiringly at dins-
more dinsmore rose if the court
please mr beele is assisting me in this
case and sat down judge brazleton
nodded beele with his elbows on the
table looked at ryan steadily without
a smile


detective fiction weekly

    captain ryan give us the circum-
stances which led you to arrest the de-
fendant said brown

  ryan related how the clerk had
called headquarters and how he and
wood had hurried to the locust and
made their first investigation  then
i went to the defendants apartment
and arrested her

    did she protest her innocence

    she didnt say much

    didnt she say anything at all
nothing important just cracked
wise at first and then got sullen and
shut up

  you say she cracked wise what
do you mean by that

   why she said she wasnt sore at
me ryan attempted a lighter pose
 she said i was all right even if-i-
did look dumb ryan felt impelled to
chuckle

   you say brown continued
 that you arrested her did you have
prints made of her fingers and the re-
volver you found in bradys room

    certainly

  thats all	  

  beele moved closer to dinsmore
dinsmore took a handkerchief out of
his inner pocket and fluffed himself
with it but he kept his seat as he pro-
ceeded to question ryan

   captain ryan how long have you
been in the police department

    twenty-seven years this january
said ryan

   thats a long time isnt it

    i guess it is

   now then captain you say that
my client jocosely declared that you
looked dumb you are not so in fact
are you or you would not hold the
office you now occupy isnt that
true

    i know my business he said
then why asked dinsmore in a
puzzled voice did you arrest the
defendant

    because i figured she did it

   of course captain you thought
she did it

  ryan nodded

  were you so thoroughly con-
vinced captain that this girl had com-
mitted murder that you questioned no
other occupants of the hotel and made
no inquiries as to their possible con-
nection with this crime

   i did check up on various people
   miss shaw for instance

    dont know miss shaw

  then ill inform you miss shaw
is an elderly lady who lived on the floor
above bradys apartment-directly
across the court and opposite to mr
higginss apartment hadnt you
thought it possible that she was the
murderer

   i didnt figure elderly ladies for
shootin racket guys said ryan

   and yet said dinsmore piously
 there are more things in heaven and
earth than are mentioned in the police
regulations did you question mr
higgins

    had his movements checked up

   did he account for his movements
at the time that brady met his death
 he was playing poker said ryan
 now then you arrested the de-
fendant ymi had her finger-prints
compared with those on bradys gun
and as a result of that comparison you
were convinced that she was the kifler
is that right

  yes thats right

   you were so certain in fact that
you refused the cooperation of some
one not connected with your depart-
ment some one who in the past had
been of assistance to you

   the detective bureau said ryan
can take care of its own business

   of colirse agreed dinsmore
 and you are still convinced that no
more searching investigation was nec-
essary that no possible ally no possible
detail was overlooked am i right
you are said ryan

   and i thank you said dinsmore
 thats all captain

  brown frowning called major duf-
field the finger-print expert he ques-
the silent witness

g

tioned him as briefly as was possible to
establish the fact that the finger-prints
on bradys revolver were floss jor-
dans dinsmores cross-examination
was equally brief

  you have written a book on your
subject havent you major

   i have replied duffield  i col-
laborated with mr bovd fredericks

   and is mr fredericks a recognized
authority 

   he is not only a recognized au-
thority answered duffield  he is
the authority

  dinsmore thanked him and sat down
brown got up bowed to the court in-
clined his head to the jury and said
 the commonwealth rests then
beele patted floss on the shoulder
winked at dinsmore and went out

  there was a moment of silence
dinsmore adjusted his collar and
walked slowly to the rail of the jury
box

   ladies and gentlemen of the jury
on the basis of the testimony you have
heard to-day given by impartial un-
biased witnesses floss jordan is
guilty of murder it is evidence
which calls upon floss jordan to stand
before you and tell you under oath
what she did in bradys room and why
the wreapon which killed brady bears
the marks of her hand my friends
 can put her on the witness stand i
would do so-if i were sure she would
talk if i were sure that she would
tell us just what happened during
those minutes which elapsed between
the minute when she hurried into the
lobby of the locust and the minute
when she raced out of it again we
would have a basis to work on we
would have the facts that would vin-
dicate my own belief in her innocence
i regret that my able opponent the dis-
trict attorney does not have even a
stronger case against my client strong
as it is but if it were so convincing
that instead of the pity i see in your
eyes as they rest upon this little girl
your gaze was such as would make her

shrink in terror then perhaps aban-
doning hope she would tell her story
and we would have the real truth

   ladies and gentlemen i repeat-
and  have practiced in these courts for
more years than i care to remember-
i know no more of floss jordans ac-
tions in the room where brady was so
foully slain than you do but why
doesnt she speak  there are theories
my friends floss was a gangsters
girl perhaps in keeping with gang-
ster code her mouth is sealed even with
her life to pay for silence perhaps
there is some one she wishes to pro-
tect perhaps afraid of the ordeal of
cross-examination she relies blindly on
the mightiness of truth which must
prevail but i can only surmise

   but this i know because i have
not lived so many of my years in these
courts without learning a little about
my fellow man  i know that floss jor-
dan is innocent of this crime mr beele
of the telegraph knows from that
fountain of instinct with which god
sometimes blesses newspapermen that
floss jordan is innocent hence he is
assisting this defense fortified with
faith in that innocence we shall fight
the good fight in her behalf i ask
you ladies and gentlemen of the jury
when her fate is put into your hands
to consider everything brought out by
our evidence which may be in her
favor i shall ask her once more to
speak if she still refuses remember
there are some things which to all of
us are better more sacred than life
itself

  dinsmore sat down looked at a
memorandum and called his first wit-
ness   ralph higgins

chapter v

i shot him

the reporters table in front and
the gangsters at the back sat up
pop-eyed this was better than
they had feared the whisper flew
about the room  flosss first sugar


detective fiction weekly

 higgins very debonair in english
 homespun and a rosebud in his coat
 took the stand

 you live at the locust apartments
 dont you mr higgins

  n v  y

      es

  on the same floor as the apart-
 ment occupied by the deceased

  right

  isnt your room just on the other
 side of the corridor from bradys

  yes

 were you home about  a m
 on the twenty-fourth of september

  i was

  and did you hear any shots about
 that time

 three

 do you recall how they were
 spaced were they fired in rapid suc-
 cession or like this dinsmore tapped
 once with his pencil paused and tapped
 twice in succession

  i dont recall higgins answered
  do you know the defendant miss
 jordan

  about three years

  do you know about her association
 with brady

  well-yes

  were their relationships pleasant
 so far as you know

  so far as i know

  and you knew her rather well at
 one time didnt you

  pretty well

 was she familiar with the use of
 firearms 

  not that i know of

  did you ever see her handle a
 gun

 not that i remember i didnt
 answered higgins

 were you friendly with brady

  not very

  would you mind telling me why
  oh he just didnt click with me
 thats all higgins relaxed a little
 from his elegance

 dinsmore said slowly  but in spite
 of your unfriendliness with brady in
 spite of his-association with the de-

 fendant nevertheless you were willing
 to assist in her defense isnt that so
  yes

  in fact you were willing to
 finance it you are financing it isnt
 that so

  higgins looked embarrassed  well

 -yes-

  why said dinsmore gently
  higgins fingered his hat  well
  shes not a bad kid i think she rates
  a break

   i see you think shes innocent
   do you think id pay out that
  good money any other way higgins
  demanded irritably

   did the police question you in con-
  nection with this case

  they certainly did

   thats all cross-examine

 brown began  higgins you say
 youve been a friend of the defendant
 for three years tell me did you ever
 live with her

   i dont see what thats got to do
  with it higgins protested

   answer yes or no put in judge
  brazleton

  higgins shrugged  no he said
   but wasnt she your woman
  again higgins shrugged  we ran
  around together

 brown grinned significantly and
 nodded  was she bradys-girl
 too

   i dont know

  you dont eh

   no i dont

   all right then thats all said
  brown and again nodded significantly

  the reporters nodded significantly to
  each other also one remarked
   pretty punk for her and four
  women on the jury but dinsmore
  quite unperturbed motioned to a
  middle-aged man who had entered the
  court room while higgins was testify-
  ing and signaled him to the stand
  what is your name sir

   boyd fredericks said the witness
   are you the same boyd fredericks
  who is the co-author with major duf-
the silent witness



  field of a treatise on identification by
  means of finger-prints

    i am

   how many years have you devoted
to your subject

   twenty or more

  now then mr fredericks said
dinsmore taking two pieces of card-
board from his briefcase  i show you
two photographs of certain finger-
prints have you compared one with
the other

    t have sir

    are thev or are they not identical
    they are

  dinsmore handed him the pho-
tographs

   will you tell me where you saw
these before and how you came to ex-
amine them

   fredericks held up the prints  this
one i secured from the bureau of
identification or  rogues gallery  of
the police department the other i
made myself from prints on a maxim
silencer given me by mr beele
dinsmore held up a metal object is
this the silencer

  fredericks looked at it  it has
my mark of identification on it it is
there was a scramble in the court
room dinsmore wheeled and yelled
 stop that man stop him higgins
had darted down the center aisle
bowling over the rheumatic tipstaff
who tried to block him but as he
reached the swinging doors one of
them hit him full in the face and
beele coming in through the other
bent his arm back in a hammer-lock
pinned him face against the wall and
reaching over higginss shoulder
pulled a revolver out of his arm-
holster ryan elbowed his way down
the crowded aisle and beele smiling
sardonically said  ryan hes got a
 this time as an officer of the law
youve got to arrest him for carrying
concealed and deadly weapons

  uniformed officers and plainclothes
men together with the tipstaves were
quieting the court room ryan took

higgins away dinsmore fluffed him-
self with his handkerchief while the
court pounded for silence which was
immediately broken by another stir at
the door the court frowned judi-
cially up the aisle dinsmore turned his
head expectantly then he grinned and
the reporters stable stood up as a body

  it was arty beele again sauntering
down the aisle baggy-legged rough-
jowled weary-eyed yet smiling faintly
he came his hands in his pockets his
hat crushed under his arm and be-
hind him stumbled a nice straight-
nosed brown-eyed young man the
kind that every girl hopes to be able to
invite to sunday dinner

  well beele was beginning half-
audibly  here we are see me nab
that higgins baby dinsmore

  but floss was on her feet crying out
brokenly  don oh don

  im here floss the young man
shouldered arty aside  itll be all
right now

   oh don-i- she choked and
then he was clinging to her hands and
they were sobbing and laughing to-
gether the women in the front rows
whispered to each other and smothered
applause sounded-at the back the re-
porters table sat down and scribbled
madly

   for the last time there will be
order in the court thundered judge
brazleton

  your honor interposed dins-
more suavely  may i ask for a recess
of five minutes

   is this young man also assisting
you in this case rasped the court
 your assistants seem to partake of
the quality of a circus

   not precisely but he is assisting
the defendant

   no recess declared the court
arty beele sat down in the chair
which somehow had remained invio-
late to him took out a cigarette put it
away and leaned back to take in the
proceedings dinsmore removed the
young mans arm from flosss shoul-


detective fiction weekly

der and replaced it with his own he
whispered to her she nodded her
head the reporters table heard him
say  everything floss and they
heard her answer  everything air
dinsmore - so help me dinsmore
led her to the witness chair

  she was nervous but it seemed the
nervousness of courage she seemed
supported by the fact that not ten feet
away was the young man that adored
her and by the knowledge that she
looked as well as it was possible for
her to look the effect produced by
her smartly plain hat her suit of vel-
vet-soft tweed her scarf of pointed
fox held every eye her hands in
gloves of immaculate doeskin rested
on the rail before her she did not
look like a gangsters girl-like two
gangsters girl

  dinsmore waited a moment for the
picture to register then stepped before
the witness stand

  what is your name

   florence jordan her voice wras
low

   speak a little louder floss said
dinsmore

   florence jordan she repeated in
a louder voice

   thats better dinsmore smiled
at her  thank you floss

   now tell us please what happened
on the night of september  and in
the early morning after

  nervously at iirst and then with
more control she told of what had hap-
pened at a dooners party dinsmore
interrupted her once to say were
you jealous of this woman brady was
making love to floss

  she answered  i wasnt jealous i
just didnt want to be insulted that
way and the way he spoke to me
drove me crazy

   what did you do after brady left
the party

   i went home

   where do you live

   around the corner from the lo-
cust

   and then what happened 

   somebody called me on the phone
somebody called me on the phone and
said that brady-that he had taken this
woman to his apartment

  you had been drinking hadnt
you 

   well it was quite a party

   and who was it that called you
she hesitated  does it make any
difference

   the truths important now floss
dinsmore told her

 well-it-it was whitey hig-
gins

   your friend higgins who testified
here awhile ago 

   not my friend

   and you wrere still under the in-
fluence of liquor

   i bet i drank a months rent

   then what happened

   i ran around to the locust i went
up to bradys room i saw his gun
on the dresser he was lying on the
couch she stopped her breath was
coming hard

  dinsmore said now take your
time floss just take your time weve
got all the time there is want some
water 

  floss shook her head the words
came slowly but terribly clear  you
understand i was cock-eyed drunk i
grabbed the gun-i closed my eyes-
and i-i shot him her hands in
their new gloves gripped the rail

  the court room was so silent that
the creak of browns chair sounded like
a whip-crack dinsmore shoved one
hand into his pocket took it out and
said  so thats wdiat you wouldnt
tell us is it floss

  she nodded and closed her eyes an
attendant gave her a glass of water
dinsmore went on   how many times
did you fire

  her whisper was clear at the very
door  once once-and then i ran
 cross-examine said dinsmore
and sat down

  brown walked up close to her  you
the silent witness



say you shot brady as he lay there on
the couch

   yes i said it god help me-
i did

chapter vi
the lady in black

and you say you only shot him
    once

         once

   well if as you say you were-
er-cock-eyed drunk how can you be
sure you only fired once

   i am sure there are some things
youre sure of

   why did you run away

   say she demanded  do you
think i was waiting for the tabloids
brown looked annoyed  you say
you only shot him once all the other
witnesses of proved credibility have
testified to hearing three shots

  she nodded  i heard the other two
shots myself i heard them just as i
was running out of the room

  brown permitted himself to smile
 so you account for three bullets in
bradys body by two of them being
fired after you threw the gun on the
floor

   i am not accounting im telling
you what happened i heard them i
dont know where they came from

   do you expect me to believe that 
brown cried savagely

  well she snapped if youre
really interested to know i didnt ex-
pect you to

  brown waved her angrily away she
smoothed the doeskin gloves with
trembling fingers and sought the chair
beside don

   now said dinsmore grimly  i
will call mr arthur welliver beele
beele took the stand without a
change of face

   what is your occupation mr
beele

   im a reporter for the telegraph
were you in the course of your
duties assigned to this case

  it looked to me more like an act
 of god

  did you inspect the room where
 the crime was committed

  oh yes said beele ves indeed
 alone

  if you mean  had company yes
 if you mean i had help no

  who was there

  among others captain ryan

  during your inspection did you
 find anything which you considered
 evidential with respect to this case
  oh yes said beele calmly

  what was it

  a maxim silencer designed to fit
 the barrel of a thirty-eight smith and
 wesson revolver

  did you know that when you
 found it

 beele shook his head  im only a
 reporter so j took it to an ordnance
 expert that i know

  wrho is that 

  frank johns that fat man over
 there with the fuzzy overcoat

  you took the silencer away with
 you 

  i did

  why

  it would have been a shame to
 waste it

  didnt you endeavor to cooperate
 with the proper police authorities when
 you were in possession-wholly inad-
 vertent possession-of what might
 prove valuable evidence

  i always try to

  did you snapped the court  or
 did you not

  your honor returned beele  the
 answer is yes

  and what about the police depart-
 ment said dinsmore

  the police department beele de-
 clared sadly  gave me the cold shoul-
 der

  so thereafter dinsmore went on
  you worked by yourself

  you might as well call it that

  what did you do with the
 silencer


detective fiction weekly

   i turned it over to mr boyd fred-
ericks for finger-print comparison with
some prints in the rogues gallery

   whose prints 

   ralph higgins arrested for high-
way robbery with intent to kill in 
but never brcnght to trial

  object shouted brown
objection overruled snapped the
court  the witness may continue

   then i made the rounds of the
residents of the hotel the one i
wanted had become an ex-resident

   who is that

   miss euphemia shaw-that nice
little lady there in black shed lived
 the iloor above higgins and brady
right across the court from higgins
she told me she ate lobster on the night
of the murder she remembered being
awake at two fifteen because she was
trying to read a magazine story in less
time than the minutes allotted at the
beginning of the story shed heard
the shots and she thought lobster was
a better way to die beele paused
why said dinsmore

   because it sounded to her as if
somebody was trying to kill her two
of the bullets landed in the woodwork
over her window

  are these the bullets dinsmore
handed them over

   they are

   did you ascertain their caliber

   theyre thirty-twos

   and brady was shot with thirty-
eights

   exactly

   go on

   well  just had a hunch that they
might have been shot from an auto-
matic an automatic ejects the cylin-
ders so i climbed down the fire es-
cape from miss shaws room-theres
a glass roof that covers the court and
there they were two nice little
cylinders

  these said dinsmore handing
them over

   these

   go on

   then i went to visit captain ryan
he took away a thirty-two automatic
from higgins one day when i wjas
there i went to see it again

   did you get to see it

   see it why he even told me to
go and shoot myself with it so i took
it and gave it and the cylinders and
the bullets to mr johnswho is as i
said the fat man in the fuzzy overcoat
who knows all about ordnance

  mr johns who was indeed fat and
fuzzily overcoated corroborated what
mr beele had said about the silencer
the automatic the cylinders and the
bullets

  miss shaw declared that mr beele
had broken both blades of her sewing-
scissors in digging the bullets from her
window-frame and had forgotten to
get her a new pair also that hence-
forth she simply couldnt bear lobster

  dinsmore shoved together the ex-
hibits his little eyes glittered above
his flushed cheeks

   your honor he began  the de-
fendant has admitted firing a shot at
brady but it is my purpose to give
emphasis to the proof by reestablish-
ing the time of the murder and calling
back mr higgins and collins the bell-
boy that higgins was in his room at
the time when floss jordan ran out
i shall prove that there were not three
shots fired but five shots of these
five only one as i shall prove could
have been fired by floss jordan i in-
tend to prove that the other four were
fired by higgins i-

  brown was on his feet interrupting
 your honor it seems to me-

   mr dinsmore may continue
ruled the court

    shall show dinsmore went on
a little faster  that higgins fired two
shots the shots that killed brady he
fired those in bradys room from
bradys gun the gun with the silencer
they were not heard the dead man
lay on the couch i will show that he
took off the silencer and placed it in
the drawer he wiped off the gun and
the silent witness



put it on the dresser but he forgot
to wipe off the silencer they always
forget something then-

   your honor said brown  i-
 go on snapped the court  go
on mr dinsmore

   then dinsmore coninued quick-
ly  he telephoned to floss jordan his
lying story of brady and the other
woman he knew floss well-well
enough to know she wouldnt let it go
by and when he knew she was in
bradys room he heard the shot she
fired immediately he went to his win-
dow and fired twice from his own gun
and-

   if the court please brown was
shouting wildly then some one shook
him by the elbow it was ryan his
face red

  dinsmore raised his voice  the
number of shots heard correspond to
the number of thirty-eight caliber bul-
lets fired from bradys gun i will
show that floss jordan fired her shot
at a dead man and so-

  if it please the court brown
shouted still more loudly 

  judge brazleton exclaimed wrath-

fully  mr brown you are decidedly
out of order

   i beg to differ brown retorted
 captain ryan informs me that he has
just elicited a confession from higgins
claiming self-defense

   well said beele an hour later in
dinsmores office  now lets see five
hundred for experts five hundred for
expenses that leaves five hundred i
have and a thousand you have write
a check for that pop before you go
fishing

   check  dinsmore demanded  i
dont have to make checks out to my-
self

   dont you ever think of anybody
but yourself  its not nice to give wed-
ding presents in cash checks are a
lot more refined and you can give
me a drink because im going to brace
old harrington for a five-buck raise

  dinsmore made out the check and
filled the glasses  this is nice bene-
dictine arty real extra-legal stuff

i	got it from judge brazleton

   well said beele holding up his
glass  save a shot for ryan

concealed weapons

out in kansas city joseph desmond night attendant at the monarch
garage was going about his work shortly after midnight when he felt
a nudge in his side turning he sav standing beside him a masked
negro the negro had one hand hidden in his coat pocket the pocket bulged
in a highly suggestive manner the object that caused the bulge seemed to
be pointing at desmond

    desmond paused not to argue without a word he went to the cash
register and surrendered the sixteen dollars and some odd cents it contained
the bandit pocketed the money and started out of the garage

     alas for thebandits plans fate stepped into the ring in the person of
w j brown a street car dispatcher who had seen the whole performance
brown had a revolver he displayed it to the negro who curiously enough
showed no fight made no attempt to draw his own weapon and hastened to
admit that brown was the boss

    at police headquarters the bandits curious lack of belligerence was
explained a search of his bulging side pocket brought to light not a snub-
nosed automatic but-an empty soda bottle

    the negro explained that he needed the money but didnt want to kill
anybody to get it
two shot roared out and a bullet chipped
a splinter off the railing

                his trail almost beyond unraveling

                    by leslie macfarlane

duke puccelli was shot in
the back early saturday after-
noon as he sat at a table in
morans speakeasy and within an hour
gangland was in an uproar

  dukes slayer made a quick get-
away moran was out in the back open-
ing a case of beer at the time and he
didnt see the shooting there was
only one other customer in the place
then an inoffensive citizen from up-
town and he cleared out in a hurry
so in a manner of speaking the iden-
tity of the killer wras unknown

  in a manner of speaking

  every one knew that the man who
had finished duke was either butch
sikorski or one of his henchmen

  butch was a beer baron duke was
another and duke had crossed the
sikorski deadline once too often it
was common knowledge that one or
the other was ripe for the hurdles

  at any rate reprisals followed
swiftly

  somebody heaved a pineapple onto
the veranda of sikorskis home and
blew a hole in the house that you could
have driven a truck through some-
body else took a pot shot at a sikorski
torpedo as he was coming out of a river
front poolroom and put a hole through
his hat brim it was that close

  the war was on

  it had been brewing for months
down in gangland men kept their rods

loaded their eyes and ears open and
their mouths shut the homicide
squad turned out almost to a man
ready for action there was a dirty
night ahead

  all of which is by way of leading
up to the announcement that detectivc
murphy didnt get the job

  like any normal man he had no
particular relish for a bullet in the back
but like any normal irishman he did
have relish for excitement and the
prospect of a battle so when the in-
spector detailed most of the homicide
squad for the puccelli case and the
resulting uproar detective murphy
was disappointed because he was kept
in the office detective levinsky whom
murphy didnt like was also retained

   gorry and its no place for a man
warmin a chair when theres all sorts
of murderin cutthroats out lookin fer
trouble groaned murphy

   you should worry chirped levin-
sky  its better than spendin a
couple of weeks in hospital aint it or
havin the rest of us cough up to buy
you a wreaf 

  ye would say that grunted
murphy  sittin down is no job fer
an irishman when theres fightin in
the air

   somebodys gotta stick around
said levinsky never know when
something else might break

   therell be nothin else break this
day-excepting down by the river
where we wont be sent

  but detective murphy was wrong
something did break the inspector
called him in

   beat it out to  manley street
he ordered crisply  chap named
fenwick killed house belongs to a
man named white

  ah beamed detective murphy
 thank ye inspector its more than

i	hoped fer

  youll have to handle it alone i
cant spare levinsky just now

   and its not me thatll kick about
that either

  murphy departed happily at any
rate a death in the suburbs was better
than nothing although deaths did not
always mean murder levinsky mut-
tered you love work dont you
and lit another cigarette

  murphy clambered into a depart-
ment car and drove out to manley
street where he found that no 
was a neat little brick house exactly
similar to a score of other neat little
brick houses on either side and across
the road a patrolman was at the
door while a little group of bystanders
stood at a respectful distance and
stared

  whats it all about dan asked
murphy

  guy named fenwick got bumped
off said dan opening the door
 shot through the head he roomed
here

   anybody else in the house

   white and the wife theyre up-
stairs havin hysterics together

  dan led the way toward a kitchen
at the back of the house and there
murphy saw the body of the man lying
on the floor it could be seen at a
glance that he was dead and that his
death had been caused by a bullet that
had struck him in the forehead

  the victim was in his early thirties
a square-faced solid-looking fellow al-
most six feet in height and heavy in
proportion beside his body lay frag-
ments of a bottle that had smashed on
the floor and the neck of this bottle
was still grasped in his right hand on
the table just beneath the window
were two glasses one of which con-
tained a small quantity of colorless
fluid

  murphy inspected the room the
patrolman spying half a dozen young-
sters who had clambered to the roof of
the garage in the back yard for a better
view of proceedings brandished his
baton through the open window and
ordered them to clear out

  youd think it was a ball game
grumbled dan
c

  on the floor near the body was a
sheet of crumpled newspaper murphy
picked it up carefully it was page
fifteen of an evening paper published
in the city of a date about two weeks
previous

  the detective examined it thought-
fully to the patrolman he gave the
sheet considerably more attention than
its importance warranted murphy
finally put the paper on the table with-
out folding it looked around the room
again and asked where he could find
mr and mrs white

   theyre  upstairs said dan
 she went sorta cuckoo and lies been
tryin to quiet her although hes al-
most as bad himself

   who told you about this busi-
ness

   the woman she came gallopin
out of the house yellin murder kept
sayin oh tom killed him tom
killed him i come in and white -was
sittin in the front room talkin to him-
self scared green i got a whiff of his
breath and i think hes kinda stewed
tom killed him eh whats
whites first name do ve know
toni

  detective murphy went upstairs in
a bedroom at the top of the landing
he found mrs white a fragile pretty
little blonde lying  the bed sobbing
and moaning convulsively sitting be-
side her was her husband

  murphy had seen frightened men
before but he had never seen a man
quite so frightened as mr white his
face was gray beads of perspiration
stood out on his forehead his lips were
blue his eyes stared vacantly he was
a big man and for one of such bulk
such abject fright was somehow incon-
gruous murphys practiced eye saw
that while the fellow was not drunk he
was under the influence of liquor to
some extent

  well said murphy this is a
bad business what happened

  white gulped then said thickly
 he-he was shot

   thats easily seen who shot
him -

   i-im not saying anything mut-
tered white  theres  use asking
me ill have to see my lawyer
murphy rubbed his chin reflectively
 ye dont have to- talk unless ye
have a mind to he admitted  did
ye shoot him yourself

  white shook his head

  no  didnt kill him im not
going to say anything ill have to see
my lawyer-

  mrs white sat up suddenly

  you killed him she screamed
 you said you would ive seen it
coming your suspicions-all those
things youve said about jim and me-
why couldnt you let him go he was
leaving anyway

  overcome she fell to sobbing hyster-
ically again

   there w-as some trouble between
ye and the man who was killed  asked
murphy

  white his hands twitching stood
up no there wasnt any trouble-
 there was clamored the woman
fiercely  theres been trouble all
along ever since jim came here to
live with us youve been silly and
jealous

   lets get this straight said
murphy patiently  who are ye
talkin about maam who was he
jealous about

  jim tim fenwick and now hes
dead murdered

   i wasnt jealous said white sul-
lenly jim was a friend of mine i
wouldnt have asked him to come and
room here if he wrasnt

  yes snapped the woman you
were the one who asked him and from
the day he came into the house you
were suspicious of me you accused
him of all sorts of things theres been
nothing but trouble

   thought he was tryin to break up
your home eh said murphy to the
man

   i did raise a row white admitted

 d
murphy kills two birds



 he wasnt to blame though he
convinced me that there was nothing
wrong why we just made up the
quarrel this afternoon we shook
hands on it and we were having a few
drinks just to show there was no hard
feelings

  yes encouraged murphy

  well-we were having a few
drinks he got killed

 how

   thats all im going to say mut-
tered white doggedly  ill have to
see my lawyer

  you killed him screamed the
woman  i heard the shot i came
downstairs and he was lying dead in
the kitchen

ii

 when ye came downstairs
 maam said murphy  where
 was your husband

   in the dining room sitting by the
table mopping his face with a hand-
kerchief

   did ye see the revolver 

   no i didnt see it i guess he threw
it away out the window probably
but he has a revolver-a great big
one

   you heard the shot maam
yesthen i heard somebody fall
on the floor and a bottle smashed i
ran downstairs right away

  and your husband was sitting in
the dining room

      i	es

   how long did it take ye to get
downstairs

   only a few seconds i ran

   did they have a row this after-
noon 

   they had one this morning tom
had been throwing slurs at jim all week
-about me this morning jim took
him up and told him what a fool he
was and that there was no reason for
being so jealous and suspicious jim
said be was sick and tired of it and
he was going to room somewhere else
tom went out after lunch and came

  d

  back about the middle of the after-
noon j im was upstairs packing tom
went up and they talked for awhile
they came downstairs and went out
into the kitchen i went up to my room

i	could hear them talking and drink-
ing

   how long were ye up here before
ye heard the shot

   more than an hour i guess

   hmm murphy turned to white
now have ye anything to say

   shes right as far as it goes im
not talking ill wait until i see my
lawyer

   mebbe yell need him murphy
said politely nevertheless as he went
downstairs again he was aware of a
certain professional admiration for the
suspect  the lad knows his potaties
the less he talks the better chance his
lawyer will have to get him off
there was no doubt in his mind that
white had killed fenwick that seemed
clear enough just the same there
were a few points that puzzled him he
went out into the kitchen and found
that the doctor had arrived and was
now examining the body

  if ye can dig that bullet out doc
id like to have a look at it suggested
murphy

   i guess i can get it for you it isnt
in very deep and i have my instru-
ments here

   he went out quick eh 

   like that said the doctor snap-
ping his fingers  never knew what
hit him

   didnt even have time to let go the
bottle said murphy shaking his head
sadly  we never know do we
one minute were here and the next
minute we aint its a caution to be
sure

  he went over to the table and looked
long and earnestly at the two glasses
then he gathered up the fragments of
the broken bottle from the floor and
subjected them to scrutiny even mak-
ing an attempt to fit some of the pieces
together after that he made various


detective fiction weekly

measurements in relation to the posi-
tion of the body he went outside and
prowled around the garage for awhile
looked at the newly planted garden
finally returned to the house

  the doctor had extracted the bullet

   there you are he said handing it
to murphy  what kind of a cannon
fired that

  murphy turned the slug of lead over
in his hand

   a big one eh  he grunted
 forty-five caliber by the looks of it
he looked at the body on the floor
 ye didnt have much of a chance
me lad

  he put the bullet in his pocket then
went over to the table and picked up
the sheet of newspaper again it in-
terested him the page had been torn
from a two-page sheet and it was
crumpled at the top and bottom
murphy made various experiments re-
storing the paper to its original folds
and at last nodded sagelyt

   of course he said  i should
have seen that in the first place

  he telephoned to headquarters and
reported to the inspector then went up-
stairs again the man and the woman
silent and fearful were still in the bed-
room

  yell have to come with me he
said to them

  white stood up readily

   are you arresting me 

  yes - and no said murphy
 the lady will have to come too

  mrs white was astonished

 me

   im sorry maam but the inspec-
tor will have some questions to ask ye
both

   theres no need of that declared
white brusquely  my wife was up-
stairs when this happened she doesnt
know any more about it than she has
told you already

   mebbe said murphy enigmati-
cal  shell have to come along just
the same

   but why  she doesnt know any-

thing i tell you she didnt see the
shooting

   listen roared murphy suddenly
 listen me man are ye trvin to
shield somebody

  the question caught white off his
guard he made a nervous fright-
ened gesture then licked his dry lips

   no of course not but-

   then why dont ye talk  why
wont ye tell what yeknow 

   i dont have to talk i know things
look bad for me thats why i want
to see my lawyer first

   sure growled murphy he
swung suddenly about to face the
woman  why was fenwick leavin
this house

for a moment she coidd not answer
then she said in a high tense voice
 ive told you he was tired of
toms attitude he didnt want to
cause trouble-

  arc ye sure bellowed murphy
 are ye sure it wasnt because he had
a quarrel wid him were ye sore at
him because he was leavin

  listen here exclaimed white
angrily

   shut up hurry up maam an-
swer me was that the reason

  she began to sob hysterically

   no it wasnt ive told you the
truth

  murphy turned to the man

   wheres that revolver

   downstairs

   where

   in a cupboard in the kitchen

   i want to see it both of ye can
get ready to come with me to head-
quarters

  white accompanied the detective
downstairs and led him to the kitchen
cupboard where he took a heavy re-
volver from an upper shelf it was
a forty-five caliber weapon murphy
held it by the barrel then wrapped a
towel about the revolver in order that
possible finger-prints would not be
eradicated

   well take a look at this later on
murphy kills two birds



he promised  better get your hat
and coat

  white hesitated

   i wont walk to headquarters he
said  will you let me call a taxi

   no need of that murphy assured
him  ive got a car outside we
never let our customers walk-at least
not until were finished wid em
murphy left the house under police
guard and drove down to headquarters
with mr and mrs white he sat in
the front seat with the chauffeur but
he noticed something that made him
think white turned up his coat collar
and pulled his hat down over his eyes
even in the shelter of the car it was
natural enough perhaps that the man
would want to hide himself from the
eyes of curious neighbors but it struck
murphy that the suspect carried his
caution to an extreme 

  suddenly he slapped his thigh

   a hunch he exclaimed  ive got
a hunch

  whats that you say asked the
chauffeur

   nothin

  at headquarters he reported to the
inspector and the whites were brought
in for questioning

  the inspector who could bluster and
bellow with the best of them when it
came to cowing some tough victim
adopted a more subtle technique in this
case he made his inquiries suavely
even sympathetically treated the pair
with quiet courtesy tried to lull them
into a sense of security but he learned
no more than murphy had gathered
the woman asserted that her husband
had slain fenwick in a jealous quarrel
the man doggedly clung to his determi-
nation to say nothing until he had con-
ferred with his lawyer

  they wrere detained pending arrival
of the district attorney murphy was
left with the inspector who turned to
him and said

   its the woman of course

   i had that idea meself observed
murphy

   she killed fenwick and now her
husband is trying to protect her i
guess he figures that if he keeps his
mouth shut well charge him with the
murder instead of her and when it
comes to trial we wont be able to get
enough on him to convict so theyll
both go free

   its a smart scheme so it is sir

   well give her a grilling later on
shell come through

   if she did it said murphy  she
will 

   well stay on the case you may
be able to pick up something new talk
to the neighbors nose around

    ill do that sir

  murphy withdrew but instead of 
returning to the white home he made
his way directly to morans speakeasy
where duke puccelli had met his death
earlier in the afternoon had any of
his superior officers encountered him
and inquired the reason for his pres-
ence in a locality to which he had not
been assigned murphy would have ex-
plained with perfect truth that he was
still working on the fenwick murder
as a matter of fact he was following
the  hunch  that had occurred to him
while he was bringing mr and mrs
white to headquarters

  the speakeasy was located above a
pool room and consisted of two
sparsely furnished rooms with a busi-
nesslike bar at the rearand a little al-
cove back of that one of the precinct
men hansen bv name was still on 
the ground puccellis corpse had long
since been taken away

  who sent you here growled
hansen  i dont need no help
murphy grinned as he eyed the neck
of a bottle protruding from hansens
pocket  no he said  i dont be-
lieve ye do

   have one then growled han-
sen reluctantlv  they missed it in

   	j

the clean-up

  murphy was prowling around back
of the bar  none fer me thanks
not when im on duty


detective fiction weekly

   what are you lookin for asked
hansen suspiciously

   evidence

   everythings gone there was a
squad here from uptown they took
away everythin theyd need

   sure but im thinkin they might
have left somethin  might need
grunted murphy he was hidden be-
hind the bar then he straightened
up thrusting something into his pocket
 and they did

   i dont get this at all whats the
big idea

  murphy whistled amiably

   have they found who killed puc-
celli yet he asked

   no and they wont nobodyll
talk you know how it is these
mobs settle things themselves

   i guess the sikorski mob could
tell eh

  hansen became confidential

   thats just it he said  ive got
more than a pretty good idea that they
dont know either one of them birds
is a guy i can talk to see and if he
knew anythin hed tell it to me and
lie says that it wasnt a sikorski man
butch himself said so they figger it
was some outsider that had a grudge
against duke and bumped him off
knowing sikorskis mob would get
blamed for it

   boloney

   you dont have to eat it im only
tellin you what  know if it was an
outsider did the job hes probably sit-
tin back all safe and sound and laugh-
in to beat hell because hes stirred the
gangs up to battle theyve been look-
in for an excuse long enough

   i dont like to brag said murphy
expansively  but im willin to bet ye
a cigar-a ten-center-that inside an
hour ill know who shot puccelli

   i thought you said you werent on
this case

   im not returned murphy  im
just performin a delicate little trick
known as killin two birds wid one
stone its an old irish custom

  whereat he strode out jauntily and
hastened back to headquarters

ill

in a private room he faced white

 have ye seen your lawyer yet 
     white shook his head

   hes on his way down

    and ye still insist ye wont talk 
    no

  slowly murphy took a sheet of
newspaper from his pocket unfolded
it and put it on the table

   see that

   what about it  a sheet of paper
thats all

  know where i found it

  white hesitated his eyes shifted
he was pale  why-no he stam-
mered

   back of the bar in morans speak-
easy

  white tried to remain calm but the
effort was a failure

   yell notice said murphy  that
its half of a full sheet of newspaper
that was torn in two and here he
continued taking another sheet from
his pocket unfolding it and piecing
the two together  is the other half
ye can see how it matches i found
it in the kitchen at your house it was
used for wrappin up a bottle of gin
so by puttin two and two together in
a manner of speakin i guess you were
at morans place this afternoon thats
where you got the gin that fenwick
was pourin out when he was shot
white was silent he rubbed the
back of his hand across his perspiring
brow at last he said

   yes-i got the gin there this morn-
ing

  murphy shook his head

  ye got it this afternoon ye were
workin this morning and ye left the
house early this afternoon went to
morans got the gin and then came
home murphy leaned across the
table  who shot duke puccelli 
white leaped up

 i dont know i wasnt there-
murpiiy kills two birds



  ye were tell me who shot
him

   i dont know i tell you i dont
know his name i only saw him for
a few seconds i dont want to say
anything about it white clamored
 you know what it means if i get in
wrong with any of these gangs if
you use me as a witness ill be mur-
dered theyll get me moran said so
he told me to keep my mouth shut
white sat down weakly he was
trembling frightened

  murphy studied the man for a few
moments then he remembered what
hansen had told him

   is that what yere worryin about
he laughed  well just listen to me
the man who shot puccelli aint in
any of the gangs hes playin a lone
hand he dont belong see if he
wants to shut you up hell have to do
it himself and as long as hes run-
nin around loose the more dangerfor
you once we get him locked up yeve
got nothin to be scared of for he
wont have any friends on the outside
gunnin for ye figure that out
white figured it out

   is that straight goods he asked
finally  i wont have the whole si-
korski gang on my neck if i tell what
 know

   the sikorski gang wont give a
good-sized hoot what happens to the
man who killed puccelli he aint in
their crowd if its playin safe ye
want to be tell what ye know and have
him locked up

  white nodded his head thoughtfully
 if hes an outsider that makes a
difference he said

   i was tipped off to it not less than
twenty minutes ago

  white drummed on the table with
his finger tips

   i was in morans place all right
he said  i went down there to get
a bottle of gin i sat down and had
a drink puccelli was sitting at a table
near the door he was pretty drunk
the door opened i guess the fellow

must have had a duplicate key for
moran keeps it locked and only opens
if you give the right knock this man
stepped into the room looked over at
puccelli hauled out a revolver and let
fly he drilled one at me too but i
was under the table by then moran
gave a shout from the back and was
just coming in when this fellow beat
it moran didnt get a look at him
 do ye know his name 

   never saw him before he was
short and slim dressed in a gray suit
a neat little chap but tough thin
face his nose looked sort of funny
i think it must have been broken at
one time

  murphys big fist thudded on the
table

   yeve as good as told me his
name he declared  wait a minute
and ill show ye his picture

  he hastened out of the room and re-
turned in a few minutes with two
rogues gallery photographs profile and
full-face of a young man officially
listed as hymie kranz alias grant
alias robinson former pugilist confi-
dence man and convict in the order
named when white looked at the
pictures he nodded

   thats the man

   ah said murphy

iv

according to all the rules and
l regulations murphy should have
reported to the inspector but he
didnt he had handled the case alone
so far and he had no mind to let some
one else - levinsky for instance -
share the glory of the climax so he
hastened out to locate hymie kranz
without assistance

  there are ways and means the un-
derworld has many eyes so has the
police department in twenty minutes
detective murphy was ascending a
flight of stairs in a cheap apartment
house uptown

  he halted before a door and rapped
  footsteps some one called out


detective fiction weekly

   whos there

   headquarters growled murphy
 open up

   just a minute

   come on come on open up

  there were vague sounds in the
apartment and then a sudden and sus-
picious silence murphy tried the door
it was locked

  no time to lose he whisked out a
bunch of keys designed for just such
delicate emergencies he tried one
and then another he lost valuable
moments before he found one that
fitted the lock he thrust open the
door rushed into the apartment it
was deserted he ran into the kitchen-
ette at the back the window was
open he looked out a steel fire
escape dangled against the brick wall
it swayed slightly and the window just
below was open at the same time
murphy heard the scream of a woman
and a confused uproar in the apartment
beneath

  he wheeled about and ran back
through the apartment into the hall
and peered over the stair railing just
in time to see a man plunge through
a doorway just below

   stop roared murphy tugging at
his revolver

  the man looked up something
flashed twro shots roared out and a
bullet chipped a splinter off the railing

  murphy returned the compliment
but the man was already racing toward
the street door he fired again glass
crashed hymie had reached the door
the apartment house was aroused a
woman was screeching people were
running out into the hallways

  detective murphy plunged down the
stairs hymie was out in the street
now murphy gained the pavement
just in time to see his quarry leap to
the running board of a taxi parked by
the curb and thrust his revolver into
the face of the astonished driver

  the taxi man was taking no chances
the car began to move away from the
curb

  murphy crossed the pavement in two
bounds and leaped toward the car just
as hymie swung around revolver up-
raised more by good luck than good
judgment murphy struck hymies
wrist and the revolver went off harm-
lessly they grappled together tum-
bled off the running board and crashed
to the paving there even hymies
pugilistic skill was of no avail because
detective murphy weighing close on
two hundred pounds was uppermost

  hymie did make an effort to get rid
of the gun he managed to free his
arm for a moment while murphy wtas
reaching for the handcuffs and hurled
the weapon far out into the road into
the traffic the taxi driver however
retrieved it this was fortunate be-
cause the revolver was important

  a certain laboratory device at head-
quarters revealed the cold fact that the
bullet extracted from the body of duke
puccelli had been fired by the revolver
of hymie kranz and could have been
fired by no other weapon it was a
big revolver and the markings on the
bullet were distinctive

  the laboratory device revealed a
further astonishing fact at least it
was astonishing to every one save de-
tective murphy the bullet that took
the life of duke puccelli was identical
in markings with the bullet that killed
jim fenwick

  later on hymie kranz admitted
what science had already proved he
had murdered both men

   i bumped off the duke all right
he confessed sullenly  he stole my
sweetie while i was in stir so i come
back to get him there was another
guy in the speakeasy when it happened
and he got a good look at me this
beak of mine gives me away every time
so i got scared hed tell i figured id
better get him out of the way too
i made moran tell me his name and
where he lived so i went up to the place
and hung around the garage until i
saw him standin in the kitchen pour-
in a drink then i plugged him
murphy kills two birds



   the mistake he made said mur-
phy discussing matters with the inspec-
tor  was in pluggin the wrong man
poor fenwick was just about the same
size and build as white was he was
the goat

   you certainly killed two birds with
one stone said the inspector approv-
ingly  but howr did you dope it out
what made you figure that neither
white nor the wife killed fenwick
murphy shrugged

   anybody could see it he observed
modestly  fenwick had the bottle in
his hand when he was shot and there
was only a bit of gin in one glass and
none at all in the other the glasses
were on the table so fenwick must
have been standin at the table facin
the window when he got shot the
bullet was right in the middle of his
forehead that showed two things-
that whoever did it wras a fine shot and
that he was standin outside the house
more than that the bullet hadnt gone
in very deep and it was fired by a big
revolver if it had been fired close to
him it would have gone clean through
his head puttin two and two to-
gether i figured that the lad who shot
him must have been standin out by
the garage so that got me to thinkin
that it wasnt white nor his wife if
they was doin any murderin theyd
stay in the house to do it

   but how did you hook that up with
the puccelli affair

   that was where me hunch came
in i was wonderin why white
wouldnt talk when things looked so
bad agin him at first i got to think-
in as ye did-that his wife did the
killin and he was just tryin to protect

her then i noticed how he kept him-
self hid when he was in the car on the
way to headquarters  had seen the
smashed gin bottle in the kitchen and
the newspaper it had been wrapped up
in the paper bein on the floor showed
me he must have got the gin just that
day and when mrs white said he had
gone out for awhile in the afternoon
and started drinkin wid fenwick when
he come back it showed me he got the
gin early in the afternoon he must
have been in a speakeasy and then
it all popped into me head at once sir
he was scared and he was keepin his
mouth shut because if he told us that
fenwick was killed by mistake hed
have to tell its about the affair at mo-
rans he was afraid if he give evi-
dence agin the lad that shot puccelli
the whole sikorski mob would lay for
him

   cant blame him

    just sorta guessed that he must
have been the customer in morans
place when duke got bumped off after
that it was simple enough i went
down to morans to make sure and i
found the rest of the sheet of news-
paper moran had used to wrap up the
bottle of gin that proved it then
i talked to white quietlike and he had
to admit he saw the killin i per-
suaded him hed be a lot better off if
he told me who did it so he described
the lad and i knew it must be hymie
kranz the broken nose pinned it on
hymie so then i went out and got
him

   it sounds simple when you say it
quick remarked the inspector ayd
he grinned approvingly at detective

chief inspector gilmartin takes
a hand in the riddle that
baffles scotland yard  who
murdered sarkisian

by charles barry

 im millie buchan
the girl cried hyster-
ically  let my
father go

what has gone before

leonidas sarkisian an un-
scrupulous money lender was
 found murdered in his office in
the brandt building his secretary
miss ransome summoned buchan the
elevator starter who called the police

  miss ransome could shed little light
on the circumstances of the murder
she did relate to the police that
buchan bending over sarkisian mut-
tered   you deserved it you dirty
swine buchan confessed to barber
of scotland yard that he had said such
a thing because he knew sarkisian was
the man responsible for sending his
daughter millie  on the road to hell
suspicion was also directed against
bertram w buckeridge but he
proved an alibi buckeridge was a
debtor of sarkisian a sudden develop-
ment of the case sent barber on an-

other angle sarkisian he learned was
one of the conspirators in a huge white
slave traffic plot barbers informant
was rose bamberger who with millie
buchan had narrowly escaped being-
shanghaied

  while barber was tracing down the
white slave angle two men called at
sarkisians office where sergeant wil-
kins was in charge one was kypri-
anos sarkisians partner the other
was a young man named barraclough

        chapter x
        the open safe

kuring the journey back to lon-
don rose bamberger was no
longer the vivacious creature
who had enjoyed telling her story to
the

d

police she was subdued and

 this story began in detective fiction weekly for april

silent and her handsome eyes were
now and then on the point of shedding
the tears which she would fain have
kept back

  barber was thoughtful also lie
found himself wondering what his next
step should be and he was less con-
fident than he had been that morning
of solving the mystery of the murder

of leonidas sarkisian already within
a few hours he had run up against
several developments which might or
might not provide clews to the identity
of the killer but practically every one of
them pointed in a different direction
from the others to follow one track
might mean the cooling of the scent
upon another

  remembering his promise to look in
on sergeant wilkins he decided to
visit the brandt building first and so
having deposited the grateful rose at a
spot not far from her lodging he ar-
rived there to find that his subordinate
had been nothing if not thorough not
only had kyprianos been detained
against his will but his visitor as well
having received barbers instructions
the sergeant had promptly gone to the
outer office and without a word of ex-
planation had asked that young gentle-

man to give his name and address a
request which met with the indignant
refusal which its heavy-handedness un-
doubtedly deserved

    all right the bluff detective said
calmly  youll stay here till my in-
spector comes along

  kyprianos advised his friend to
comply with the sergeants demand but
wilkins had already retired to the
inner office with a wink to the con-
stable whose back was now made to
lean against the outer door it was the
resistance of that back which met in-
spector barbers effort to push the
door in from the landing

 hello he said when the
door opened  whats the
 trouble 

  without waiting for an
  answer he asked

   which of you is mr ky-
prianos

sarkisians partner rose from
the easy chair in which he was
sitting tranquilly smoking

 i am he said politely  to
whom have i the honor of-

 ah there you are the ser-
geants voice interrupted from the
door just a word sir

  barber went into sarkisians office
 the other young chap the ser-
geant told him hurriedly  is the one
i told you about over the phone he
saw kyprianos in town last evening
but kyprianos says he came up from
folkestone this morning says he can
prove it the young un wouldnt
give me his name and address when i
asked for them so i thought id let
him cool his heels out there till you
came his first name is reggie thats
all i know

  barber smiled then nodded and went
back to the outer office

   so you are mr kyprianos he
said as if he had not been interrupted
i should like a word with you in a
minute or two in the meantime i
wish to see your friend mr reginald
-er-
	detective fiction weekly

   barraclough the young man in
question supplied at once in an ag-
grieved tone  i dont see why i
should be kept here like this  have
nothing to do with this bally murder
and-

  he stopped probably because he had
not expected to be allowed to get so
far and stood gaping open-mouthed at
barber who was quietly listening with
a slight femile on his lips

   yes the inspector said  and
  barraclough was silent

   now barber resumed in a cheer-
ful tone  will you kindly give me your
address mr barraclough

  the young man after a short hesita-
tion handed over a card which bar-
ber immediately passed to wilkins

   verify this he ordered

  he turned again to barraclough

   while the sergeant is going
through that little formality he said
it would save your time and mine if
you would just tell me in what circum-
stances you saw mr kyprianos last
night

   i was probably mistaken barra-
clough answered readily enough now
 but i must say-sorry kip if it puts
you in a hole-i must say i thought i
saw him getting out of a taxi in the
strand-corner of craven street-
about nine oclock last night but if
kip says i was mistaken then  was
mistaken thats all about it

    i see

  barber turned to kyprianos but the
latter said nothing he was standing
with a smile on his handsome face
looking at the smoke curling up from
the cigarette he held in his hand

   excuse me sir the constable ad-
dressed barber but this gentleman
hasnt said that he wasnt in the strand
last night i heard every word theyve
said about it

   the constable is quite right ky-
prianos said then  i have neither de-
nied nor asserted the fact

   will you do one or the other now
please barber requested

   well no i dont think i will the
roumanian replied

   why not

   because frankly speaking the
other said  i dont see the relevancy
of my presence or otherwise in the
strand yesterday to my partners death
in the brandt building this morning

  barber was spared a remark on this
by the return to the room of sergeant
wilkins the latter nodded to his
superior

  you my go now mr bar-
raclough barber told that young man

  if i want you i know where to find

you

  the tone in which this was said
made it equivalent to an order and
barraclough went though now he
would have been quite willing to stay
barber returned to kyprianos

   i am quite aware mr kyprianos
he said  that the matter may not ap-
pear relevant at first sight but there is
this to be considered if i find that you
have been in london during the past
few days when you have told sergeant
wilkins that you were in folkestone
i may feel inclined to doubt the state-
ment that you arrived in london this
morning and act accordingly

   quite so kyprianos answered
coolly  but before you go any fur-
ther may  correct you in one par-
ticular i have never told sergeant
wilkins that i spent two days in folke-
stone

  barber turned to the sergeant who
was now glaring at the roumanian

   well - ill - be - d - sorry-
blowed wilkins exclaimed almost
apoplectic with anger  he told me
just that didnt he crocker

   i believe so sarnt the constable
to whom he had appealed answered

   i distinctly remember kyprianos
told barber  telling the sergeant that
i came over from france on saturday
and that i stayed two nights at the
queens hotel in folkestone

  by george yes thats right
wilkins conceded handsomely after a
the clew of the clot



pause  so you did its a mistake i
shouldnt a made

   hm barber commented  so
you ivere in london last evening-

   i have not said so

    hm the inspector reflected aloud
 sunday now if i remember aright
the last train to folkestone on sunday
is somewhere round about half past
nine that would get you into folke-
stone about midnight eh

   that is so i believe kyprianos
agreed with a smile there is a
train which arrives at folkestone junc-
tion a few minutes after midnight

   wilkins barber said to the ser-
geant after a pause get on to the
queens hotel folkestone and find
out firstly if mr kyprianos has been
staying there second if he had his
meals there in other words how much
they saw of him when he went out and
when he came in and all that sort of
thing third when he left definitely
and lastly above all get a description
of the mr kyprianos who stayed
there

  wilkins disappeared into the other
room

   that last point was a clever idea
kyprianos commented with a smile

   now look here mr kyprianos
the detective inspector said  it is
quite clear to me that you are trifling
with me i dont know why but let me
tell you that its not a profitable
pastime however while the sergeant
is in there we will talk of other
matters just tell me how you found
out that sarkisian was engaged in the
white slave traffic

   ah you know that 

  barber nodded

   in that kyprianos declared  i
am out to help you all the way but i
tell you honestly inspector that i will
not give you the slightest help in the
matter of finding out who killed my
late partner

 oh why

   because the man deserved to be
killed i have no strong feelings at all

about the murder as murder-crime
against society and all that sort of stuff
a greater crime against society is the
one he was engaged in that is my
opinion at any rate and i will tell you
all i know as you probably have
been told i went to the continent on
a business tour in a paris hotel i
came into contact with a man-a
greek who discovered in the course of
conversation that i was sarkisians
partner and took it for granted that
i was in with him in all his affairs
in fact i believe that sarkisian gave
him so to understand this man is
doing on the continent what sarkisian
was doing in england and is the in-
dividual who practically controls the
whole business in france

   at first when he spoe to me about
it i was somewhat bewildered and
probably showed it for the man
thought that i was merely-how do
you say-playing safe and began to
chaff me i am not very slow inspector
and it occurred to me to humor him
i asked him how was i to know that
he was who he said he was and that he
wasnt trying to pump me in other
words i played the man who was
afraid of a police trap he immediately
produced a little brass token which
looked indian in type

  barber nodded

  ah you see the significance at
any rate i pretended to be satisfied
when i saw it and he began to talk of
certain details of the organization
believe me inspector it will need all
the efforts of the police of a dozen
countries to smash that organization
why there are even police officials
mixed up in it-not in england but
elsewhere-so you see the difficulties
i let this fellow think that i had been
away from business for some weeks
and that i was rather  out of it  for
the moment and that gave me an ex-
cuse to take notes quite openly of what
he said so i have a lot of data which
i can let you have--addresses changes
of address and all that sort of thing

i


detective fiction weekly

   i was lucky though in one matter
this creature complained that sar-
kisian had not answered his last com-
munication and i happened to ask
how the fellow had addressed it-to
the office or to sarkisians house he
told me that he didnt know what the
address was except that it was a place
in greenwich i wrote that down too
and told the man that that address
had been abandoned i gave him the
crouch end address in order to keep
my end up atid made that an excuse to
get his list of english addresses to see
if it needed revision i may say that
im afraid i rather messed up his list
so that the police will probably be
getting curious communications from
the dead letter office soon

   you will let me have all that in-
formation as soon as possible i hope
barber said

   yes as soon as you like after i get
to my rooms

  barber could not help congratulating
himself on the  leg-up  that these dis-
coveries would give him with his
superiors even if he did not succeed
in elucidating the murder case

   that will be very useful he said
aloud  but i must say that i am not
quite satisfied about you mr ky-
prianos i can quite well imagine you
killing mr sarkisian especially after
getting possession of the knowledge
that you were being associated with his
dirty traffic

   i can quite well imagine it also
kyprianos replied  in fact i think
 had almost intended to do it up to
saturday evening and-er-ah-

   oh  why up to saturday eve-
ning barber asked quickly

   that is my affair inspector was
the suave reply as kyprianos seemed to
recover from a momentary confusion
 let us put it that i thought that he
would meet with his deserts other-
wise

   youre a bit of a mystery to me
the detective said bluntly  in fact
im rather astonished even at your at-

titude with regard to the white slave
traffic in the part of the world you
come from they arent easily moved to
indignation about it  believe

  the greco-roumanians face dark-
ened

   i was mostly brought up in eng-
land inspector he said curtly  be-
sides i have special reasons for my at-
titude in the matter

   wilkins came in and barber did not
hear what the special reasons were

    whats the report he asked

   the sergeants notebook was in his
 hands

    i spoke to the porter on duty at
the queens hotel folkestone he re-
ported also to the receptionist at the
same hotel both state that a mr
kyprianos arrived at the hotel in a taxi
which came from the harbor at half
past one on saturday afternoon as if
he had come from the one oclock
boulogne boat after engaging his
room he washed asked for that days
london papers looked through them
quickly and went out immediately did
not come back till dinner dined in the
hotel restaurant and went to bed early
yesterday mr k breakfasted in his
room a fiat car from a local garage
came for him mr k drove off in it
and was absent all day until about half
past eleven both porter and recep-
tionist are certain to within five min-
utes of the hour as they happened to
have conic into the hotel a few minutes
before this morning mr k break-
fasted at the hotel and left at seven-
thirty was heard to direct taximan
to central station

  and the description barber
asked

  its mr k all right wilkins
declared  tall handsome dark
small black mustache heavy eyebrows
almost touching over bridge of nose
scar on back of index finger of right
hand-receptionist noticed that when
he signed the register

   kyprianos held out his right hand in
silence the scar was there
the clew of the clot	

    

  wilkins continued reading from his
notebook

   dressed in a brown double-
breasted suit turned down collar with
pointed ends dark and light brown
check tie fastened at the  v  of the
waistcoat by a plain gold bar safety
brooch

  the description was an accurate one
of the man standing before them

   mm  the inspector murmured
that seems all right

   it is all right kyprianos averred
may be barber replied but i
wish you were more frank about your
movements

   sorry not to be able to please you
inspector the other said  but i can-
not all that matters i presume is
that it is clearly demonstrated that it
was physically impossible for me to
have been here this morning to kill my
partner

   m-yes the detective agreed  t
suppose that is all that matters but i
dont consider that it has been clearly
demonstrated

 oh why

  if you were able to get to folke-
stone from london in less time than it
takes a train to do it on one occasion
what is to prevent you getting from
folkestone to london in a similar
manner

   true kyprianos admitted  but
that is an if

  well we wont discuss it now
barber told him  and if you wish to
leave you may do so provided you
leave me the keys of any safes there
are

   i have only a sort of tin cash box
thing kyprianos said  sarkisian
has a safe but it is open i believe
however here is my key ring

   the premises will be at your dis-
posal some time later in the evening
the inspector informed him  but i
hope to see you at the yard before that
with that information you promised
me

  after the roumanian had left bar-

ber stood looking at the floor for some
minutes

   i say wilkins he said suddenly
 did you let kyprianos into sar-
kisians room

   no took him into his own office

  barber unfolded the evening paper
lie had bought on his way and skimmed
the meager account of the brandt
building murder which nevertheless
filled several columns of print

   humph he muttered  theyve
even got my name but not a word
about that how the dickens did he
know that sarkisians safe was open

  wilkins turned to the open-mouthed
constable

   did you tell him he asked

  never spoke to him the man
replied

  the two detectives looked at each
other

  unless barber reflected he
met that ransome girl and she told
him but-yes-why did he never
mention her-not once

chapter xi
father and daughter

tm off to the yard barber said
j then  here take these keys go
through all the papers you can
find you constable-you look an
intelligent fellow-you give the ser-
geant a hand all papers that you
dont understand or that refer to any-
thing outside the business of the firm
put aside and take to the yard and
wilkins its a case of white slave
traffic so hurry

  you dont say the sergeant
gasped and would have asked more
but his superior was already halfway
down the stairs

  barber found his way out through
the front door blocked by the broad
back of the commissionaire who was
deputizing for buchan he pushed the
man unceremoniously aside and came
face to face with rose bamberger-
an angry and perturbed rose
g

detective fiction weekly

  oh here he is she exclaimed
 djew know this guy with the
uniform like a general in the navy is all
bone from the neck up he wouldnt
lemme go up to see you

   indeed barber asked in amuse-
ment  and why the desire for a sight
of me come walk along with
me

  they left the commissionaire staring
after them

  the girl was out of breath from ex-
citement and from running

  gosh ive had a knock she
panted   went back to the roomin
house an-an-oh millies gone
barber stopped on the bottom step
gone where	

   wisht i knew look at this
she handed the detective a piece of
paper

   it was pinned  the pillow she
told him

  barber read

  dkar rose

  many many thanks for all you have
  done for me you can have all my
  things and the money in the top drawer
  good-by	miiuk

  can you beat it rose declared
almost in tears and gee im fond o
that kid shes gone an killed herself
as sure as shootin

   shootin isnt always dead sure
barber consoled her

   taxi he called out to the rank
opposite and when the taxi came
bundled the girl into it and ordered
 scotland yard

  he pulled out his notebook as they
drove along

   now he said  give me as good
a description of your friend as you-
can

  the little new yorker proved her-
self an observant friend for when
barber entered the narrow door under
the archway of scotland yard ahead
of her he found no difficulty in recog-
nizing the girl who stood beside the
doorkeepers office as millie buchan

   lady to see you sir the door-

keeper announced  been waiting
here for nearly an hour

  oh youre inspector barber
the girl exclaimed almost hysterically
im millie buchan i killed sarkisian
let my father go

   millie rose exclaimed as she
saw her friend and heard the state-
ment  you didnt thats a darn-
yes rose i did millie buchan
interrupted  thats why i went out
early this morning

   come upstairs both of you bar-
ber ordered  theres no need to let
all whitehall and the embankment
know it

   well for the love o mike rose
half sobbed as she went up the stairs
in the wake of the other two  can
yah beat it can yah beat it

  millie buchan was a tall not un-
handsome girl whose features bore a
striking resemblance to those of her
handsome father but her otherwise
pleasing appearance was marred by the
discontented pout of a rather foolish
girl to whom life has not yet given all
that she wants of it

  barber in a room temporaily placed
at his disposal by a yard man whose
duties for the time being were out of
doors took down her statement with-
out other comment than a question here
and there whose object was merely to
clear up a detail left obscure he had
given her the stereotyped warning
beforehand and when she had placed
her signature at the foot of the fools-
cap page he had filled he said as he
blotted it

   now miss buchan i have only a
word to say if this confession of
yours has been made for the purpose
of obstructing the work of justice
your position is a serious one there is
still time to tear it up

   i dont want to tear it up the girl
answered stubbornly

  aw gwan millie manys the
one wouldnt give yah the chance
rose sitting forlornly in a corner of
the clew of the clot

g

the room pleaded earnestly  take it
all back dont be a darn fool yah
know there aint a word of truth in it
you wont the inspector asked
and receiving no reply stood up

 very well miss buchan he said

 i will keep it in the meantime you
may go back to your rooms with miss
bamberger and you miss bamber-
ger will please keep your eye on this
young lady and see that she gets into
no more mischief

  roses stare of amazement was
transformed into a broad grin as she
noted the meaning look in the detec-
tives eye

   i getcha she answered nodding
vigorously  i getcha cmon millie
im swore in as deppity sheriff but
gee im just dyin for a feed

  but-but- the other girl pro-
tested why dont you arrest me
i-i-and wont you let dad go

    oh we dont do things like that
barber told her quite seriously  i
suppose i should really put you in the
cells but i cant just let your father
walk out like that because you signed
this thing oh no theres a lot
more to be done before that

  aw cmon millie rose cried
with a wink in barbers direction
 hell pull yah in when hes good an
ready yah must wait till he gets yer
sheets aired for yah gosh goil yah
dont want to catch cold fore you go
to the chair

   barber could not help smiling at this
curious method of consolation

    i dont wish to be rude ladies he
said  but im a busy man these days
so if miss buchan will be good enough
to write down for me the address of
that house in greenwich i could bear to
see you go

   i getcha was roses answer
millie write quick

   millie wrote the required address on
the paper barber placed in front of
her and they went to the door rose
holding the other firmly by the arm

 ill look after her all right rose

called out  dont you worry none
whatever an say dont blieve her
neither

  when they left barber smiled not
altogether in amusement at the thought
of the relative positions of the two girls
-the one a stranger to the country
whose life by her own admission had
been none too regular and who had
only that day tried to kill another per-
son as well as herself now mothering
the other older by a year or two than
herself a native or at least a denizen
of london and hitherto supremely
confident of her own ability to steer a
way through the pitfalls of a great city

  as soon as he judged that they had
left the building the inspector took up
the paper just signed and holding it in
one hand went down to cannon row
police station and requested that ser-
geant-major buchan be brought to him
from the cells when the commis-
sionaire looking  less spruce than
when at the main entrance to the
brandt building appeared before him
barber spoke at once with well-
assumed heartiness

   well sergeant-major he said
 so weve got to admit a mistake you
didnt kill sarkisian after all

   a see buchan replied somewhat
dourly a suppose ye got the one
that did it that yere talkin like that

   yes ive got a written confession
here barber told him and offered the
paper  would you like to read it 
it will interest you im sure

   onybody a know  buchan asked
taking the paper hesitatinglv

    read it

  the commissionaire read the first
few lines of the confession and stopped
the paper fell to the floor while his
hands remained stretched out before
him in the same position as when he
had held it he stared aghast at the
inspector

   millie he whispered hoarsely
 man it canna be shes gone aw-
dye mean ta say she didn go away
after all he finished lamely
g

detective fiction weekly

   she signed that paper ten minutes
ago barber assured him

   an she says that she killed that
da-that swine the other questioned
incredulously

   so she says-as you can see if you
read to the end

  the sergeant-major was silent for
some seconds then he stooped and
picked up the paper from the floor he
read it through from beginning and
then began again barber turned as if
to look at something on the desk be-
hind him a ripping tearing sound
did not make him turn back again

   its a damn lie the commis-
sionaire cried  theres her confes-
sion for you

  barber turned then

  m-m he said calmly i see
youve torn it up why

  the sergeant-major looked at him
pityinglv

   why he growled why be-
cause she ony madeit up to save me
shes fond o her father still the bairn
but it wont save me a killed him-
dye hear  a killed him masel

   i wish youd settle it between you
barber told him in the weary tone of
one who was rather uninterested

   what dye mean 

   oh nothing at all the detective
said sarcastically  im just talking
for the sake of talking as a matter
of fact buchan im fed up with all
you would-be murderers however if
you want to make a confession to take
the place of this one ill hear it but
mind you make it a confession that i
cant pick any holes in or youll be the
victim of the next murder and ill be
the candidate for the rope

   ave already made a confession
buchan mumbled

   i heard you the inspector said
dryly  but id like details-whens and
hows and things like that-and also
id like to see the revolver

  buchan was silent

  h-m the other went on you
cant make any of that up on the spur

of the moment isnt that it suppose
i told you that t dont believe a word
of your daughters confession would
you stick to yours then 

  is she all right the sergeant-
major asked anxiously  no harm has
come ta her

   what has that got to do with it
barber asked  you cant make a
conditional confession you know
if any harm has come ta her a
dont care if a do swing for killin
that dog was the commissionaires
only reply to this

   i see barber said  now listen
to me-a man who has never married
and knows nothing about it your
daughter im practically certain has
come to no real harm and sergeant-
major buchan if any harm had come
to her you would be in great part to
blame you have been too hard on
her dont forget that young people
nowadays cant be treated as we were
in our young days

   a know it a know it now

  it was only the other day that an
old clergyman- man who had never
married barber went on  said to
me the young girls nowadays are like
the young fillies that have been brought
in from the hills for the first time
you must ride them gently their
mouths are soft and their backs are
ticklish do you get me

spector went on  because it is only a

was dropping deeper and deeper into
his native doric

ters here for your release

missionaire asked  that either of us

room

  on his way to his bachelor rooms
the inspector that evening laughed at
himself crookedly

  by jove he said to himself
 youre taking on a lot son-advising
foolish girls and intolerant fathers and
what not hmph ought to have been
a bloomin parson

chapter xii

three statements

before leaving for his home bar-
ber had arranged that the house
at greenwich should be watched
and that anybody coming away from
it should be detained for inquiries the
next mornings experiences however
drove out of his head all thought of
asking what had resulted from these
measures

  when he arrived at scotland yard
well ahead of his usual time for begin-
ning work he found that no fewer
than three visitors already awaited his
coming he gave orders that they were
to be admitted in the order of their
arrival the first was a lady of ma-
ture years dressed in a fashion which
identified her calling at once

   your name please barber inter-
rogated when she was shown into his
temporary office

   sarah tckson she replied

tion for me

laughed  theyre good lads times

a bit but the police never worrits me
knowin as ive ad troubles-moren
me fair share-

  barber had no inclination to listen
to a catalogue of the charwomans
troubles his experience as a police-
man had taught him that the list was
likely to be prolonged so he interrupted
with a question

   when you were at the brandt
building on monday morning did you
hear anything like a shot before the
girl screamed

   now i might ave sir an i might
not mrs hickson replied  an if i
did as like as not id never a noticed

gates openin an shuttin its a very
noisy time o the day in them big office
buildins sir i was just thinkin me-
self sir as-

  but the detective had no time for
the ladys theories

nevertheless

  mrs hickson sniffed

rible but its the talk of our street

ing

kins an liza mullins an jane ogg

   mpf aint we got eyes an ears
it was im as led that pore head ser-
geant-majors daughter into bad ways
an everybody knows as she wasnt the
only one
tiie clew of the clot



  finding that there was nothing more
to be extracted from the charwoman
except the gossip of her street he es-
corted her courteously to the door-
an honor which her contented expres-
sion showed she appreciated

  on her departure there entered a
pasty pimply youth with an affected
voice and laudably careful enunciation
who gave his name as albert sweeter
he stood for a moment in front of
barber twirling his bowler hat round
and round in front of him

   well mr sweeter the inspector
invited

   i came to say sweeter began
after a polite cough  that  believe i
-that this ere-er-this mr sarki-
sian was killed by mr erskine of
the anglo-uruguayan trading com-
pany

  indeed the inspector exclaimed
and then thought  by jove i heard
that name somewhere yesterday

   yes

   what are your grounds for that
belief 

   i eard-er-eard mr erskine
threatening to blow the ead off sar-
kisian

   when was that

   saturday morning ten oclock on
the landing above sarkisians floor
yes

   yes

   oh for heavens sake spit it out
barber exclaimed irritably  i cant
waste time squeezing it out if you
have a statement to make make it
what cxactly did you hear how did
you come to hear it go on

   i-i- the other went on with less
assurance  i am an invoice clerk at
osborne  clarks an-and on sat-
day morning i appened to be passing
along the corridor from my room to
the managers office and mr erskine
and sarkisian was-were standing on
the landing outside mr erskines
door and mr erskine was very angry
and i heard him say to sarkisian that
if he found him interfering with any

of his young people any more he would
blow the top of is ead off o-off
him

   i see can vou swear that 

   yes

   good write your name and ad-
dress on that pad and if i need you
i will send for you

  sweeter wrote as directed and hes-
itated before going to the door

   well  barber asked  got some-
thing else to say

   will there be a reward the other
asked  if erskine did do it

   i dont know whether there will or
not barber snapped  good morn-
ing

  he rang a bell and the third visitor
was shown in this was a little spick
and span elderly man with gray hair
and gray toothbrush mustache and the
detective was not surprised when he
announced himself in staccato tones to
be major heald-hawkins late of the
rutland light infantry

  yes major barber asked after
waving him to the easy chair  what
can i do for you

   nothing sir nothing the major
barked  but perhaps i can do some-
thing for you help you to discover the
murderer of that scamp sarkisian

   you didnt hear anybody threaten
him on saturday i hope barber
asked involuntarily

  eh  what  gad no sir but ive
threatened to horsewhip him myself
sir

 oh when

  what does it matter major
heald-hawkins asked brusquely
 never had a chance to do it sorry to
say but we cant have murder we
cant have murder here what do
you think of this

  wrhile he was speaking the major
had a hand in his breast pocket and he
now jerked it forward toward barber
so suddenly that the latter almost ex-
pected to see it grip a pistol it held
however nothing more dangerous than
a foolscap envelope the detective took


detective fiction weekly

it and drew from it its inclosure half
a dozen pieces of torn paper fell onto
the desk accompanying these was a
typed slip whose characters showed it
to be a carbon copy

   by jove barber exclaimed when
he had read this  this is interest-
ing i am very glad you brought this
along

  thought so thought so the
major jerked out  didnt want to
bring it but-hum-we cant have
murder sir we cant have m-

   weve had it the detective could
not help interrupting

  yes by gad weve had it the
other agreed

   how did you get this barber
asked

   came by post last night-ten
oclock delivery

   hum barber murmured as he
examined the envelope  typewritten
address a poor hand at using a type-
writer misspell one word i happen to
know that that particular montagu
crescent of yours major hasnt an
 e  at the end

   ouite right sir quite right it
hasnt

   half a minute major barber ex-
claimed suddenly and darted from the
room  ill be back in a-

  when he came back he held in his
hand the private ledger found in sar-
kisians safe

   by gad sir i know that book
the major coughed and flushed to the
roots of his hair

  barber was paying no attention to
him but was rapidly turning over the
pages

  here it is said he major
o l heald-hawkins ic montague
crescent with an  e this is where
he got it all right

   i never thought anything else the
major commented in his curious bark-
ing voice  but whos he

   thats the question barber
nodded first thing i am going to
do is try to find the typewriter

   thats your lookout now do you
want me to leave that with you

   if you dont mind major the de-
tective said  it will be shown to no-
body outside one or two people in this
building

   very good dont want half the
world to know i was a damn fool

   so you were one of sarkisians vic-
tims how did you get to know he
lent money he wasnt a registered
money lender

   i know that sir i know that the
major barked  thats what took
me in johnny corseliis introduced
me-know corseliis shot himself
two months ago that rogues fault
i took a loan from the scoundrel-
paid it back three times over-still
owing all of it i was a damn fool
sir a damn fool

  well major barber said rising
from his seat  i can imagine worse
things in your bedtime mail than your
own promissory note torn up and a
note informing you that youre free

chapter xiii
another would-be murderer

inspector barber had just got
rid of his third visitor and was try-
ing to concentrate on the new
aspects of the case presented to him by
the three statements he had received
when a telephone message from his
own division caused him to give a new
direction to his thoughts he had in-
tended to devote the rest of the morn-
ing to the examination of the papers
found in sarkisians office and house
with the special object of comparing
the information he might derive from
them with some of the material fur-
nished by kyprianos in a typed state-
ment handed in to scotland yard on
the preceding evening after his own de-
parture for his home he anticipated
from a casual look at this statement
that its value was great-if not for the
purpose of discovering the murderer of
the armenian then undoubtedly as a
the clew of the clot



pointer in the direction to be taken by
the police in their attempt to unearth
the secrets of the unholy traffic of
which the murdered man seemed to
have been one of the principals

  the inspector was however not to
be allowed to examine the papers just
yet

   weve got a young fellow here
was the report from the  e  division
 who was snooping around on sar-
kisians floor in suspicious circum-
stances perhaps youd better see him
shall we send him along or will you
come here

  ill go there barber replied and
reached for his hat

  at the police station he found the
prisoner to be a young fellow of about
twenty-five with nothing particularly
striking about him to distinguish him
from scores of others of his class in
london the detective sergeant who
during barbers absence was taking
charge of criminal investigation usually
conducted by his superior gave the in-
spector a short summary of what he
knew now that sarkisians papers
had been removed a policeman was no
longer in possession of the office but a
plainclothes man had been instructed
to keep an unobtrusive eye on all com-
ings and goings nobody of interest
had visited the office on the previous
evening after sergeant wilkinss de-
parture two employees of the firm
of auguste cherre the chemical
cleaners acting it appeared on the in-
structions of kyprianos had removed
the carpet from sarkisians room to be
cleaned

  while they were so engaged the
young man now detained had been
observed peering into the office but no
attention had been paid to him as it
was thought that he was employed by
one of the firms in the building and
had acted from a natural curiosity to
see what was happening on the scene
of so recent a murder this impres-
sion had been strengthened by the fact
that he had gone out of the building

not by the main entrance but by one of
the side doors as if very familiar with
the premises this morning however
he had reappeared and was hanging
about the landing on which the offices
of sarkisian  company were situated
the plainclothes constable-the same
who had been on duty the previous eve-
ning-had therefore asked him to ex-
plain his presence and on his refusal
had invited him to accompany him to
the police station the young man
had made no protest but now refused
to say anything he had been searched
and besides a small sum of money and
a letter signed  millie was found to
be in possession of a cheap belgian re-
volver of  caliber fully loaded for
which no permit had been issued

    lets see that letter barber in-
terrupted the recital

  the detective sergeant handed over
a rather dog-eared envelope addressed
to  mr charles molesby  at an ad-
dress in streatham the inspector
read the letter

   humph he said  she got this
out of a penny novelette

    just what i thought the sergeant
laughed  especially that bit about not
being  fitted for a humdrum and
prosaic suburban existence who is
she i wonder

   oh i think i know who she is
barber told him  in fact im sure
shes millie buchan that sergeant-
majors daughter

   ah that explains it the other
exclaimed by gum i wonder-
explains what the inspector in-
terrupted

  oh yes i didnt tell you the
sergeant replied when the con-
stable was conducting this young
whats-his-name-molesby-out of the
building one of the commissionaires
who is assistant porter told him that
he had seen him in and out of the build-
ing quite a lot lately he used to talk
with buchan at first but recently he
used to come in by a side door as if he
wanted to avoid him he was there


detective fiction weekly

on friday evening saturday morning
and-the commissionaire thinks but is
not absolutely certain-on monday
morning but not till after sarkisian
had been found

   i think id better see him barber
decided

  when molesby was brought in the
inspector noted in him an entire ab-
sence of curiosity-a total indifference
to all that went on around him he
slouched into the room as if it were too
much trouble to straighten up

  your name is charles molesby
the inspector asked

   mm charles molesby the tone
was neither listless nor dull just that
of a normal statement of a fact which
had no great personal interest for the
speaker barber decided to make an
effort to change that in the mans
present frame of mind there was no
hope of getting any information from
him

   curious that i should come across
you the inspector said casually  so
soon after seeing millie buchan
barber thought for a moment that
his ruse had failed but it was fully
successful

  millie buchan molesby echoed
millie buchan

  then he faced the inspector with
bared teeth

  where is she he ground out
 tell me or ill put a bullet through
you

  he fumbled at his side pocket and
then grinned with a more natural ex-
pression

  theyve takenit away i forgot
he said and then after a pause  im
a bit mad i think

  he shook himself and straightened
his shoulders

  barber said nothing

   sorry the young man went on
quite normally i forgot where i
was who are you

   i am detective inspector barber
 was i dreaming or did you say
something about millie buchan

  you were not dreaming barber
replied  i said that i had just been
talking to her

  no all indifference was gone
now excitement had taken its place
where then she didnt go away
then that swine-

   there seems to be something
monotonous about that expression as
applied to a certain dead armenian
barber interrupted and went on sharp-
ly  now young man that you have
come more or less to your senses per-
haps you would explain why you have
been hanging round the brandt build-
ing recently

   if you really want to know the
other said calmly  i wanted at first to
kill sarkisian because i believe he was
responsible for turning mill-miss
buchans head-taking her out to
dances and all that sort of thing and
introducing her to a lot of flashy devils
that live on their wits in the west end
if he hadnt given her a taste of that
life shed never have thought of going
away to america with-but you say
she didnt go

   no she didnt go the inspector
said and held up his hand as molesby
was about to resume  but im afraid
your explanation is incomplete it is
all right as far as friday saturday
and monday are concerned but to-day
at any rateif not sooneryou must have
known that sarkisian was dead why
were you there to-day 

   i wanted to find that typist girl
was the reply  i thought she might
know exactly where millie had gone
 i see now tell me what you were
doing yesterday morning-say-from
eight till nine-thirty

  yesterday molesby answered
vaguely  i think i left my digs in
streatham at eight or perhaps a few
minutes later and came straight up to
the brandt building i suppose it
took me over an hour i came by bus
i wanted to catch that-well that sar-
kisian coming in and if he didnt tell
me where millie was to shoot him
the clew of the clot



there on the steps and then give myself
up to the police

  you knew sarkisian then

   i had seen him millies father
pointed him out if id been able to
get a revolver in time id have killed
him weeks ago i think

   indeed  and what about yester-
day what happened

   i hung about but i didnt see him
then i saw the typist calling a police-
man and the policeman went in a few
minutes later a commissionaire told me
that sarkisian had already been shot
 youre sure you didnt shoot him
yourself barber asked dryly in a
dream or something like that 

   im sure enough of that i didnt
dream much when i was in that
quarter i can tell you

   how is it that you didnt get a
chance of shooting him-say-on
saturday you would have had more
time then in the afternoon when your
own work was finished but perhaps
you hadnt the revolver then 

   oh yes molesby answered in a
matter-of-fact tone  i got the re-
volver on thursday i waited for the
blighter nearly all day on saturday
but it was no good i thought i had
got him once but just as i was going
to go up t ohim a young chap who
was waiting in a car got there before
me and shook his fist in his face
and then went back with him into the
building

   sarkisian didnt come out again
with the young fellow and i waited on
the main entrance was closed about
two i suppose and i was hungry by
then so i went away for a bit to eat
he must have gone out by one of the
side doors when i was there or else he
left while i was away because though
i waited a long time after i had
eaten i didnt see him the only one
i saw was that young partner of his
ringing at the main entrance to get in
 what  barber exclaimed
 youre sure of that what time was
it then

   about five i should say was the
reply  and im sure it was sarkisians
partner

  hum the inspector reflected in
silence  he must have spent the
week-end in a car that lad i wonder
what he was doing

  barber walked over to the window
and looked out

   i wish i knew if that early train
business is faked somehow he said to
himself and then turned round sud-
denly

   there is absolutely no doubt in
your mind he said to molesby  that
the man you saw was kyprianos-not
another foreigner very like him they
are often alike to us you know these
southerners

   i dont know his name molesby
replied  but im sure it was the part-
ner chap if it wasnt it was his twin
brother ive seen him several times
 it wouldnt be a bad idea barber
told himself  to inquire into his fami-
ly history seems far-fetched but by
jove its not impossible twin leaves
folkestone man himself in london
all the time makes an appointment to
meet his partner early kills him after
a quarrel about that business arrives
later as the man who had traveled up
to london from folkestone oh
hang theories

  he turned to the detective sergeant
 we must hold our friend here till
all the necessary inquiries have been
made he directed you can charge
him for the present with carrying fire-
arms then make the routine inquiries
by the way molesby how do you come
to have so much leisure

   i took my holiday the young fel-
low replied glumly  but i say why
are you keeping me  i want to see-
 i dont care a hang who or what
you want to see barber snapped
 you dont seem to realize that you
are liable to twenty years penal servi-
tude for being in possession of firearms
with intent to endanger life think
that over


detective fiction weekly

   with which he left the police station
with a rush

chapter xiv
gilmartin takes a hand

back in the little room in scot-
land yard barber found sergeant
wilkins awaiting him with a pile
of papers on the desk topped by a
tear-off calendar about eight inches
square the sergeant was replacing
the telephone receiver on its hook when
his superior entered

    i was just making a little inquiry
on my own wilkins explained

    what about 

  oh nothing much wilkins re-
plied  you see that calendar notice
that saturdays and sundays leaves
are not torn off

  yes well what about it i
should think that the secretary-typist
had something else to think of yester-
day morning beside tearing off calen-
dar leaves those funny hieroglyphics
on the top page seem more interesting
to me i wonder what language theyre
in

   theyre notes in armenian the
typist says wilkins replied  but
the point is this the girl never does
tear off the leaves i phoned her up
to ask shes working there as usual
to-day

    por heavens sake wilkins bar-
ber exclaimed impatiently  what does
it matter who tore them off

    i dunno sir wilkins said hum-
bly  but you always say details is im-
portant i took the calendar along be-
cause of the notes on it and then i
noticed the date it seems sarkisian
had the habit of tearing off the leaf in
the mornings almost as soon as he ar-
rived in fact he gave strict orders
to the ransome girl not to touch that
calendar because the notes on it were
reminders it just shows that he didnt
have time to tear it off yesterday

    well

   then whoever killed him either

came in with him or was waiting for
him wilkins finished

   m-m thats so barber ad-
mitted  but it doesnt tell us anything
we didnt know there was no evi-
dence of a struggle in that room any-
way come on lets see whats in
this heap

   wilkins drew his chair up but he
shook his head and looked disap-
pointed

   while the two detectives were busily
engaged on the papers inquiries were
still being made by a small army of
plainclothes men into the movements
of all the potential suspects on the pre-
ceding morning and reports were com-
ing in by telephone every few minutes
one man to whom barber had given
the task of tracing those persons whose
names figured in sarkisians ledger re-
ported at intervals his success in several
cases and added that each person traced
had when questioned diplomatically
admitted the fact that he had received
his promissory note by post on the pre-
vious evening in each case the note
was torn in four or eight pieces and
accompanied by a note worded exactly
as had been that of major heald-
hawkins some were carbon copies and
one or two were top copies identical
with the carbons

   the papers barber thought as he
examined them seemed to give no clew
to a possible murderer what ever might
be their value in other respects they
revealed details of an organization
which horrified even the hardened
policemen accounts there wrere which
told a tale needing no explanation and
the strict conscience of the sergeant
was stirred to its depths as he saw the
sums under the headings of  enter-
tainment  fares  and such like he
swore aloud when he read minute de-
scriptions of the physical and moral
characteristics of what was euphemis-
tically termed  stock

    god inspector he exclaimed at
one point  i havent been a  busy 
all these years without knowing that
the clew of the clot



there was this damned traffic but i
never thought it was as bad as this
 neither did i barber replied
 and im all the more worried an
organization like that is bound to have
got the wind up especially as that old
schaffer -woman has got awray-and
dammit weve been slow the trans-
lation of some of these foreign papers
will also take time

   oh i dunno the shrewd wilkins
said to this  that neednt hold us up
besides a big thing like this is easier
to get at than a small gang that can
scatter in a brace of shakes

   i hope so barber murmured
gloomily busy underlining extracts for
copying

  they were still thus engaged half
an hour later when the door opened
without warning to admit a tall figure
dressed in the cutaway coat and striped
trousers of morning wear now so
rarely seen save on occasions of great
ceremony he held in his hand a fop
hat which reflected the light from the
window thus revealing a curly black
head of hair in which a few streaks of
gray appeared the mustache was of
the same color as the hair and had the
curling ends more popular in a former
day

   hello barber he greeted the in-
spector  youre looking worried

   im more than that chief was the
reply as barber rose to his feet  im
rattled

  thats bad chief inspector lau-
rence gilmartin-for it was he-com-
mented  and i thought you were such
an unrattleable beggar

  he turned round toward wilkins
who was standing rigidly erect

   youre sergeant wrilkins i sup-
pose he said  i think weve met be-
fore somewhere havent we

   you an me was at peel house to-
gether sir the sergeant answered

   by jove so we w-ere the big man
agreed  then youre the wilkins
that helped peters to get pete the
slinger in your first year on a beat

    yes sir wilkins replied his face
showing all the pleasure he felt at this
example of the memory of his one
great feat on the part of one of the
well-known men at the  yard -a
man who moreover had outdistanced
all his contemporaries in the race for
promotion while exciting no jealousy
anywhere

  ive just been seeing off the emir
of daghestan the chief inspector now
told his juniors  hence the festive at-
tire i thought however id look you
up barber before going home the
assistant commissioner tells me that
your case is more complicated than it
looked at first

   its even more complicated than
that barber told him  since i re-
ported to him theres been quite a lot
of new happenings im not comfort-
able about it chief i dont mind telling
you

   oh gilmartin sat down on the
edge of the desk  give me an out-
line of things

  the big irishman listened attentive-
ly to the account which barber made
as concise as possible while sacrificing
nothing to clarity he nodded approv-
ingly when the inspector somewhat dif-
fidently told him of his action with re-
gard to rose bamberger

  quite right he murmured
quite right

   we-e-ell he said when the inspec-
tor had finished  it certainly does
seem involved all that but it may be
simpler than you think personally i
dont see how you could have done
any more with the means at your dis-
posal well have to get more people
on to this its a number one case
and smaller things can wait if neces-
sary

  he got down from the desk and took
the chair which wilkins had vacated
he pulled toward him a double sheet of
foolscap

   nowr lets see he went on  the
first thing to do is to get everything
clear and tidy in our minds im afraid


detective fiction weekly

 i have a simple mind and i have to
 put everything down on paper it
 looks like a waste of time but it isnt
 -in my case this is how i do it
 when i have a lot of suspects

 as he spoke he divided the foolscap
 into four columns

  i make a thing like this he con-
 tinued  the first column being for the
 name of the suspect the second for
 the points against him the third for
 the things favorable to him and the
 fourth for any odd remarks that may
 occur to me whos the first ser-
 geant-major buchan down he goes

 query did buchan send out prom
 notes 

  thats the sort of thing gilmar-
 tin remarked  that youll always run
 up against a lot of presumptive evi-
 dence enough perhaps to make a
 prima facie case but not enough to
 convince a common jury on the other
 hand no really positive evidence in the
 mans favor

  unfortunately barber replied
  its not up to the accused to prove
 innocence its our business to prove
 him guilty

  fortunately the chief inspector
 corrected  fortunately english law
 is like that

  why do you put that bit about the
 promissory notes chief his junior
 asked

  just as a reminder that specimens
 of the work of all the typewriters in
 the brandt building must be taken

  i hadnt thought of that barber
 admitted

  make a note of it then gilmartin
 directed  whos next on the list of
 suspects 

  the list is a long one the inspec-
 tor said  i suppose we can take
 kyprianos next

  all right well take kyprianos

 ouerv did k send promissory
 notes 

  yes barber commented on this
  kyprianos strikes me as being a more
 likely person to have sent those prom-
 issory notes

  perhaps gilmartin admitted
  thats why i queried lets see the
 wording of the typed message that was
 sent with them -

 the sergeant turned up the note in
 a file and placed it before the chief
 inspector
the clew of the clot



  m-m yes the latter said  its
 more like the phraseology of an edu-
 cated man though you never know
 with these scotsmen the most un-
 couth of them have a knack of turning
 a neat phrase on paper

  theres a typed thing here from
 kyprianos chief barber suggested
 you know the list of addresses and
 things he found out in paris

  i know gilmartin said  but
 well leave that to the specialist con-
 cerned besides if it turns out to be
 the office typewriter it doesnt help us
 much as anybody who had access to
 it could have typed the note i can
 think of several who might have done
 it no lets get on with this tabular
 thing

 in silence gilmartin wrote on from
 his memory of barbers account when
 he had finished it was evident that he
 had missed no important point of the
 narrative the sheet of paper which
 he handed over to barber including the

   a most unsatisfactory document in
some ways gilmartin said handing
over the foolscap sheet to barber

  barber read it through

 very he answered ruefully

   still the chief inspector went on
with a smile  it keeps ones mind from
wandering

   why barber asked  do you
want to know the height of the
women 

   that is to be taken in conjunction
with the direction of the wound gil-
martin explained  because if sarki-
sian was killed-as you say he prob-
ably was-when standing the height
of the various suspects as compared
with his height might possibly be im-
portant

  if a smaller person did it the bul-
let would travel upward if a taller
person or one the same height it
would go straight across and if very
much taller possibly downward though
that is not likely the query applies
of course to the men as well by the
way what was the direction of the
bullet

   we dont know yet barber re-
plied  the post-mortem will take place
to-day if sir wilfrid sherburv gets
back to london he is away giving
evidence in that cardiff case

   i see well pay particular atten-
tion to that point

   is there anything you could advise
chief the inspector asked diffidently
 besides what you have written here 
 personally gilmartin replied  i
think the case is one for a special con-
ference with the assistant commis-
sioner and the superintendents of the
department i shall ask that men be
put on to these points i have men-
tioned here and that they report to
you and me and that we two concen-
trate with as many men as possible on
finding that old woman and rounding
up this white slave gang i have an
idea that we might find our murderer
there and even if we dont its a lot
more important that we scotch the
gang than that we bring in the killer
of a dog like that by the way is
that stuff that kyprianos sent in any
good 

   i havent had time to test it
hum then look here we must
phone the stations concerned to watch
the addresses he gives and ill get them
to put a couple of intelligent youngsters
to sift this stuff of sarkisians then
wed better collect the superintendents
and you can tell your little tale so
lets look up these addresses

  in a few minutes the addresses had
been sorted out according to their po-
lice divisions and it was chief inspec-
tor gilmartin himself who gave the
necessary instructions to have the
houses watched in each case he laid
particular stress on the possibility that
rivka schaffer who already figured in
the list of  wanted  persons might
be connected with one or all of them
and he found in almost every instance
the divisional inspector concerned to be
astonished at the information for the
houses with one exception were in
quiet residential streets the excep-
tion was a servants registry office
which-the inspector who answered
gilmartin said-catered mainly to girls
from the country and from small pro-
vincial towns on hearing the address
the clew of the clot



the inspector in question exclaimed in
astonishment

  now thats a coincidence chief
he said  there has just been a re-
port from the constable on the beat
about that place he says that theres
a line of girls obstructing the pave-
ment in front of it it didnt open
to-day

   then gilmartin ordered  get a
warrant and search it get every scrap
of paper you can find on the premises
and send them along here

   theyve probably removed their
books he went on speaking to barber
 but if not we might at least be able
to trace some of the country girls who
have been reported to us as missing
during the past months

  they were on their way along the
corridor to the assistant commissioners
room when they met one of the de-
partmental superintendents on his way
out gilmartin stopped him and ex-
plained why he wanted him

   funny you should mention that
case the superintendent said  be-
cause sir wilfrid sherbury on his way

to the mortuary to conduct the post-
mortem  your friend has just got
mixed up in a motor accident ive
just been to see the scene of the col-
lision

   is he hurt

   hes hurt but not very seriously
i think but the lad who seems to have
been responsible for the thing-a
young sport in a lavender-colored car
he calls jane-has had his leg broken
eh whats that

  the question was directed at wil-
kins standing behind the others who
had uttered an involuntary exclama-
tion

   sorry sir the sergeant apolo-
gized  but would the young fellows
name be buckeridge

   it would and it is why 

  the three detectives engaged on the
sarkisian case looked at each other

   talk about coincidences barber
exclaimed  theres one for you all
right

  is it sir wilkins asked signifi-
cantly

  gilmartin said nothing

to be continued

get your man

the royal canadian mounted police always gets its man that motto
which has made famous one of the worlds finest police forces was
recently vindicated again when the mounties arrested a man for a mur-
der seven years ago joseph germaine and samuel pat lived together on a
small farm in the squaw valley in saskatchewan pat worked for germaine
the farm was not much of a success germaine ran into debt and pat entered
into an agreement to buy the place pat had paid an installment when ger-
maine suddenly disappeared no one knew what had become of him pat
with a bill of sale took possession of the farm

     murder was suspected but there was no proof interest in the neighbor-
hood finally languished pat prospered and married but the mounties had
not forgotten constables on patrol in the district made it a habit to drop in
on pat-just friendly calls which he never suspected but slowly the royal
mounted was gathering the proof and one day a constable visited pat not
to pay a friendly visit but to arrest him for the murder of joseph germaine
               v

            

when professor nearow found a revcdver
shell still hot he picked up the firtt
clew to the solution of a weird crime

the murder at city hall

                    by claybourne dabney

thassoway nearow top
hat tail coat spats stick spec-
tacles side whiskers and all
scrambled over low railings that
divided the patches of lawn about the
statue of the citys founder

  he stepped gingerly over the last
fence behind a row of automobiles
parked on the mall facing city hall
just as the blaring thumping street
cleaning department band drew up at
the head of a small procession of cars
bearing count adelphi unofficial rep-
resentative of mussolini

  through the space between two of
the parked cars nearow darted but
was brought up abruptly by a man who
blocked his way standing in the open
door of a car talking to another man
seated behind the wheel

  professor nearow was on the point

  of turning back when the standing
  man wheeled suddenly gave nearow a
  sharp glance called good-by to the
  man at the wheel and walked briskly
  toward the crowd packed behind a line
  of police along the front of the row
  of cars

   nearow followed him toward the
 crowd noticing out of the corner of his
 eye-a fact which was to prove later of
 the greatest significance-that the man
 at the wheel waved and then leaned
 down as though to shut off his motor

    the man whom nearow was follow-
 ing shouldered his way roughly
 through the crowd with his brief case
 tucked firmly under his arm thrust a
 policeman to one side and walked im-
 portantly through the noisy band
 toward the mayor and the official party
 on the steps of city hall who were


 here he is sergeant  nearow wheeled about

posing with the distinguished guest for
the cameramen

  nearow impressed because the
policeman instead of shouting at the
man saluted tried the same tactics but
a heavy hand swung him about and he
found himself facing an irate patrol-
man

   who do you think you are pres-
ident hoover asked the policeman

   no replied nearow abashed and
annoyed  i saw that man do it so
i thought i would try it too

   oh you did hey well youre a
pretty smart boy aint you thats
alderman craigwillie who are you
 pm tljassoway nearow professor
emeritus of psychology at the univer-
sity and its official representative at
the reception here the police wouldnt
let me through over at broadway so i
climbed over the fences to get in here
 oh you did hey  well i sup-
pose you got your invite with you
doc asked the somewhat mollified
officer

  no i havent you see the profes-

sor of romance languages was invited
but he was taken ill and as i am
familiar with the italian tongue and
have few duties i was pressed into
service

   well its too bad doc but i simply
cant take a chance too many gate
crashers at these receptions to dis-
tinguished foreigners and we all get
hell about it i tell you come on back
behind the crowd and ill get the
sergeant

 the policeman pushed his way
through to the back of the crowd and
nearow followed much put out

  those nearest them eyed nearow
curiously for a moment but the magic
of martial music and the thrill of see-
ing prominent men on the steps of
city hall drew their eyes away again
prompting in nearow the sudden in-
congruous thought that although ten
thousand persons were standing within
a stones throw he might beat the
policeman unconscious with his heavy
palmetto cane and no one would notice
them




detective fiction weekly

  now spill it brother while i look
around for the sergeant whats the
song and dance again

   well you see the professor of
romance languages was ill began
nearow  and-

   hey hey look out let me by
shouted a shrill voice as its owner an
excited hatless little man with long
black hair dived between nearow and
the policeman forcing each of them to
step back to regain his balance

  the excited man plunged into the
crowd and tugged and clutched at
those nearest him trying to make a
way through

  the policeman bellowing like an in-
dignant rhinoceros leaped after him

  nearow saw the mans hat lying on
the ground in the space between two
cars from which he had so suddenly
appeared

  the professor his seamed face
wrinkled in a wry smile stepped over
and stooped to pick it up as his hand
was closing on it he noticed a shiny
brass object just under the running
board stooped further and seized it
holding it in the palm of his hand to
examine it

  it was a revolver shell and it was
still hot

  he stared at it in his hand and
wondered who would fire a revolver in
the midst of a crowd like that per-
haps before the parade a policeman
had tested his revolver but it seemed
improbable

  the patrolman and the excited man
on the skirts of the crowd were in the
midst of an argument

   calm down now mr stani the
policeman said  youve got to show
me your invitation or you dont get in
thems my orders and i stick to it

   its an outrage its a fascisti
frameup screamed the man addressed
at stani reaching frantically in an in-
ner pocket and extricating a handful
of papers

  professor nearow placed the hat
upon the mans disordered head and

was rewarded by a quick look of
alarm

  stani immediately turned his atten-
tion back to his papers however and
triumphantly produced a large en-
velope which he waved in the police-
rnnns tifp

 ha aha hey you see the
fascist plots fail again i stani al-
ways outwit the fascisti bah

   its o k avith me brother re-
plied the officer if youre through
with your speech now suppose you
come along and ill get you in

  the policeman led the way and
stani still chattering and waving the
letter followed him through the
crowd and through the band toward
the steps of city hall

   dont forget me please nearow
called after the officer and then in
chagrin so far forgot his dignity and
composure as to say with a vast
amount of feeling  damn

   whats trouble asked a voice at
his feet and he looked down to see a
cameraman changing a magazine

   i cant understand it nearow ex-
plained with a wry expression tugging
at his side whiskers  i am treated
practically like a common criminal and
theres no telling what complaints the
university people are likely to receive
about it but the same police that hold
me back let by some alderman-craig-
willie wasnt it -and a lunatic named
stani

  no mystery about that deacon
said the photographer with a grin
 craigwillies head of the bootleg
ring any cop that got him sore
would be lost in the marshes out in
little neck the next day as for that
little dago he dont look like much but
hes editor of an italian daily and head
of the anti-fascist outfit here

  well sighed nearow his crinkled
face twisted in a smile  being neither
a bootlegger nor a political wrangler
but only a retired professor i suppose
i can do nothing but wait

   wait until i get a shot from here

s d
the murder at city hall



said the photographer scrambling up
on the hood and silver radiator top of
an isotta to focus his camera over the
head of the crowd and band  and ill
fetch the sergeant and fix vou
up o k

   im much obliged to you said
nearow graciously and may i warn
you since you seem to be scratching up
that nickeled surface rather generously
that there seems to be some one in the
car youre standing on

   oh him hes dead sound asleep

i	already shot a picture from here
while you were talking to the cop

   judging from the motor car
owners ive known who approach hy-
sterics if any one so much as grazes a
fender i should say that he must be
dead nearow said

  the photographer laughed and
jumped down his picture taken

   you stay right here and ill get
the sergeant he said running off

  professor nearow was staring at
the man in the car sprawled over the
wheel it was a funny place for a man
to take a nap and a funny moment
too for one of course if he were a
chauffeur-but he obviously was not

  nearow found his curiosity had in
it a trace of nervous excitement and
suddenly remembered the revolver
shell which he was clutching still in his
left hand

  he stared at it

   tickle my sideburns he said
aloud and solemnly

  he took a step toward the car door
of course the man was probably
asleep and doubtless would be indig-
nant at being awakened possibly might
even accuse him-nearow had had
some unpleasant experiences because of
his curiosity-of being a pickpocket
it might be embarrassing-

  still-there was a bare chance-
  he took another step

   here he is sergeant called the
photographers voice immediately be-
hind him nearow wheeled about

   please excuse us for causing you
   d

any trouble professor said the boom-
ing voice of the gray-haired sergeant
 the men got their orders so you
cant blame them ill take you right in
now sir theyre just going in and
all youve missed is the bother of hav-
ing your picture took

  nearow smiled affably and bowed
acquiescence but immediately half
turned and nodded toward the car

    odd place to choose for a nap isnt
it he asked the sergeant

  yes agreed the officer glancing
first at the occupant of the car still
sprawled over the wheel and then at
the license plate which displayed a
very low number-a single digit and
a single letter

  you dont think anythings
wrong suggested nearow

   oh no probably just got a hang-
over i guess he must be some big
politician judging from the license
ill probably know him if i could see his
face

   easy enough to find out said the
cameraman breezily  ill open the
door and yell at him

  no you dont not while im
around replied the sergeant catching
the photographer by the arm  hes
probably soused and id never hear
the end of it if we caused any sort of a
scene here his friends will probably
get him away when the crowds gone
nearow hesitated his faint suspi-
cion was rapidly becoming a conviction
yet if he opened the door to find out
the man might prove to be merely
drunk there might be a scene and he
had no wish to bring any unpleasant
notoriety to the university upon such
an occasion

  ought he tell the sergeant about the
shell he had picked up was there a
connection he thought there was

   would you mind coming right
along now sir asked the sergeant
 theyre going in and ive got to
change the positions of my men to get
the crowd moving along

   ill tell one of the officials

nearow said to himself and followed
the sergeant up the steps of city hall
the photographer joined a group of
his fellows on the steps

ii

in the small reception room off the
crowded aldermanic chamber
nearow was effusively greeted by
the aldermanic president

   professor carimo was taken ill
suddenly and i am taking his place by
the way i have a possibly ridiculous
suspicion that a man outside has been
shot

   shot eh ha ha been that
way myself many a time the genial
politician laughed nudging nearow
roguishly thats a good one eh
shot ha ha

   no i mean murder said nearow
flushing and feeling he was making
somewhat of an ass of himself

  murder eh said the politician
who wasnt going to let any one think
he was lacking a sense of humor
 youre a sly one all right let me tell
the commissioner

  he beckoned to a man in a police
uniform adorned with a great deal of
gold braid

   hi commissioner ahearn meet
professor naggle-

   nearow interrupted the profes-
sor reddening again

   nero my little dog has fleas
said the aldermanic president with
another nudge nearow decided to
say nothing more of his suspicions

   glad to meet you professor ex-
claimed the police commissioner with
a hearty handclasp  its a great
honor

   whered you get the pretty suit in
macvs toy department asked the
president

   how do you like it first time
ive worn a uniform got it made
especial because the mayor said this
count adelphi was going to pin a
couple o medals on say who is he
anyway

  ill be darned if i know somebody
told me but i forgot i know half the
italian votes packed into the alder-
manic chamber and congressman
pagano said we had to look out or the
anti-fascisti might start a riot

   nonsense we got two hundred
police reserves hid right next door in
city court but there aint going to be
any trouble not while im around
do you know who he is professor

   i dont know very much about
him except that i was given to under-
stand that he had been sent over by
mussolini to reward the leaders of the
pro-mussolini faction

  yeah thats it agreed the alder-
manic president and then growing
suddenly serious said to a swarthy
stocky man with grizzled hair who had
just stepped worriedly from a tel-
ephone booth  have you located
congressman pagano yet

  no i cant understand it he
drove away from his home nearly an
hour ago they say

   youve tried the speakeasy on the
other side of the hall of records he
stops in there a great deal

   he wouldnt take a chance drink-
ing before a thing like this why hes
been planning this for months

  nearow embarrassed by overhear-
ing what seemed to be a somewhat
delicate conversation turned to the
commissioner who laughed noting his
confusion and explained in an under-
tone 

   the congressman does like his
little nip and he gets plenty seeing as
how hes the one so they say that col-
lects for the prohibition permits wor-
ries his friends a great deal

  you amaze me exclaimed
nearow

   hes no friend of mine said the
commissioner with a touch of sarcastic
bitterness nearow thought weve
been trying to close up most of the
speakeasies but its pretty tough when
a congressman is in on it

  why this is shocking nearow
the murder at city hall



said genuinely amazed  cant you
do anything about it

   what can you do  shrugged the
police chief  everybody holds every-
body elses hand and you never know
whose toes youre stepping on why
he went on waxing confidential to an
interested unbiased innocent listener
 i came in on a reform ticket but ill
be darned if i can make any headway
the stocky man was going back to
the telephone booth

   you try those places and mean-
while well have to start things going
the aldermanic president called after
him and turned to nearow 

   come professor i want you to
meet the mayor

  nearow feeling that the commis-
sioner would treat his suspicions
seriously was thus prevented from im-
mediately disclosing them in turn
he met the mayor count adelphi the
italian vice consul and several mem-
bers of the mayors cabinet including
alderman craigwillie

  the man stani still as excited as
ever was dashing in and out among
the group all of whom were nervous
about the delay

   i cant understand it craigwillie
told the mayor  he must have
stopped in at one of the places around
here he drove up at the same time
i did and we parked our cars together
i hurried on in because i wanted to see
my constituents in the chamber there
before he started things off but he said
he was coming right up and the parade
was already here

   listen to them the mayor said
nodding to the double doors leading to
the platform of the great chamber
the excited chattering was plainly
audible no telling what theyll do
if we keep em waiting any longer
well have to start off

   better let me do the speech-
making said stani shrilly well
get off the little ceremony here and
then ill introduce him to the crowd
out there

   much obliged stani said the
mayor plainly relieved

  the italian vice consul looked
quickly about in anxious amazement
the stocky man was still in the phone
booth the vice consul seemed on the
point of objecting to stani as toast-
master but thought better of it and
held his peace

  nearow was growing more and
more curious he edged over toward
the window

  below him he could see that the man
sprawled over the steering wheel of
the car had not changed his position

  he edged over to the commissioner
who was listening intently to stanis
torrent of italian delivered to count
adelphi

   hell i dont get a word of that
lingo whispered the commissioner
the mayor equally uncomprehending
was idly biting his nails the other
city officials fidgeted

  the guest of honor was staring at
stani with an expression of surprise

  nearows mind although it was
fretting about the man in the car
caught and automatically translated
fragments of stanis speech

   we appreciate the great honor
extended by his excellency but we feel
owing to unfortunate differences now
existing between pro-fascist and anti-
pascist groups of our italian-born
american citizens that it might be very
much more discreet if the highly prized
decorations be not awarded-

  nearow looked at stani in sudden
interest

  the vice consul was black with sup-
pressed rage the stocky man was still
telephoning count adelphi still wore
his look of pained surprise the others
not understanding the language looked
bored

   if he is dead nearow said to him-
self  i was standing only a step or
two away when he was killed for i saw
him wave good-by to craigwillie of
course the band was making an up-
roar but even the booming of the bass

drum would not have covered the sound
of a revolver shot

   it must have heen done with a
silencer when  picked up stanis hat
there was the warm shell if i am not
mistaken silencers are quite long and
bulky a man could not very well
conceal it under his coat without it
showing somewhat there is a bulge
under stanis coat where a shoulder
holster might be

   certainly he would have the gun
on his person a man couldnt walk
into city hall after committing a mur-
der and lay the weapon down in a cor-
ner somewhere it would eventually
be found and traced still he might
have had an accomplice

  nearow decided he had dallied long
enough he must at once confide his
suspicions to the police chief

  count adelphi was replying to
stanis speech also in italian nearow
caught phrases

   and so as you so gracefully sug-
gest we will not bestow the decora-
tions upon his honor the mayor and
the honorable commissioner of police
but will merely convey to them his ex-
cellencys cordial felicitations and deep
appreciation for the flattering recep-
tion-

  the stocky man came out of the
phone booth and his jaw dropped in
amazement the vice consul whis-
pered to him and both glared furiously
at stani who seemed on the point of
bursting with excitement

  the mayor delivered a pat little
speech of welcome and then the party
started to file in through the double
doors into the packed chamber as a
roar went up from the excited crowd
and the band ensconced in the bal-
cony struck up the italian national
anthem

  nearow caught the commissioner by
the sleeve and held him back

   just a moment please mr com
missioner something of great im-
portance he said

  the commissioner was impatient

   say i got to get my medal he
said

   count adelphi just said he wasnt
going to present the medals said
nearow quickly  but-

   well wouldnt that burn you up 
exclaimed the astonished police chief
 here after i got a uniform and all
and stood all that guying why the
nerve of-

   it was stanis doing ill explain in
a minute but first look down
there see that man in the car over
there the isotta

  asleep hey yeah what about
him

   im afraid hes dead said
nearow solemnly

  the commissioner searched his face
in sudden alarm and laughed nerv-
ously

  dead youre joking arent you
commissioner ahearns face plainly
showed his growing fright

   no im not joking look at this
went on nearow handing the shell to
the police chief

   a thirty-eight caliber revolver
shell the chief pronounced  where
did you get this

   beside the car-

   why didnt you tell me man 
why-

   well it seemed so impossible-
   it is impossible it cant be

  he was gripping nearows arm and
the pair were walking fast almost in a
trot down the hall down the circular
stairs down the front steps and across
the mall most of the crowd had dis-
persed but the police were still out in
force

  the grizzled sergeant saluted as he
ran up

   whats the matter with that man
mac murrachu the chief asked in a
low tone

   why commissioner explained
the sergeant in embarrassment this
gentleman called my attention to him
before but i thought he was taking a
little nap like and i didnt want to take
the murder at city hall



any liberties with some one who might
be somebody of importance like so-
 tell your men to keep people mov-
ing along here ordered the chief
shutting him off  and then come
over

  to nearow he added

   did you tell him about the shell
 no you see i didnt want to make
the university ridiculous and it seemed
so impossible

   it is impossible it must be

   even though the shell was still
warm concluded nearow

   oh my god man moaned the
chief carefully opening the door

  it was with a slightly sickening sen-
sation but nevertheless with a thrill of
excitement that his suspicions were
well founded that nearow saw the
form of the man lurch slightly toward
the commissioner as he opened the
door

  the commissioner put his hand
against the inert mans chest to stop the
movement and when he drew it hasti-
ly away it was stained with red

  the chief gently turned the face
toward me

   oh my god he exclaimed again
 its congressman pagano

ill

sergeant mac murrachu
white and anxious had run up

 quick mac murrachu get an
ambulance throw a line about the car
keep everybody moving dont let
any one stop to see whats going on
here

  mac murrachu hurried off again to
give instructions to his men

  the commissioner gently closed the
door and sank weakly down on the
running board placing his head in his
hands in a momentary gesture of
despair

  quickly however he got down on
his knees and searched the ground
around the car without finding any-
thing

he next examined the running

board and then again carefully open-
ing the door looked about  the seat
and floor of first the front and then
the rear compartment

   get the homicide squad quick
tell them to keep it under cover and
not under any circumstances to let the
papers know dont let anybody touch
the car until the finger-print men have
taken their impressions tell the in-
spector to report to me at once in the
mayors office when he comes

  mac murrachu saluted

   come  professor said the
commissioner and led the way back
into city hall and up to the mayors
extensive office

   wait till i get this note off to the
mayor telling him to keep that meet-
ing going for awhile he said scrib-
bling and then sent it out with the
mayors secretary

   now tell me everything you know
about it he said

  while n earow recounted chronologi-
cally what he had seen without how-
ever going into what he thought the
chief stood at the window hands
twisting behind his back staring down
at the detectives buzzing like ants
around the car

   if youre so positive that you saw
him wave good-by to alderman craig-
willie that means he was killed right
there in the next few minutes i was
hoping maybe he was already dead
and had been brought here and
propped up while nobody was looking

  but-oh hell its too- why
man its simply impossible ten
thousand people looking on and police
so thick you fall over them-

  why even i was standing there
next the mayor posing for the pic-
tures and looking pretty right over in
that direction-

  the door flew open and the mayor
pale and excited rushed in

   theyll keep em there he said
 stanis going to make a long speech
whats the matter whats hap-
pened 


detective fiction aveekly

   oh not a thing in the world
moaned the commissioner not a
single little thing except that while we
were standing there getting our pic-
tures took why somebody strolled up
with half the police in town twiddling
their fingers and took a pot shot at
congressman pagano right here in
front of city hall-

   you dont mean it-

  ahearn indicated the window the
mayor looked out

  the ambulance was moving slowly
away and policemen were carrying the
body to a patrol wagon

   dead exclaimed the mayor joe
im afraid this is your finish old man
after your speakeasy campaign was
such a flop any chance of catching
him

   can you beat it  exclaimed
ahearn after a burst of profanity
 pagano nearly ruins me by selling
permits while hes alive spoiling my
speakeasy campaign and then finishes
the job by getting himself bumped off
tinder my nose

   but how did it happen

   oh sure how did it happen  i
did it sure

  well said the mayor slowly i
suppose you would if you got the
chance but you happened to be right
with me

   i ask you how it happened the
chief said with sudden intensity
 with ten thousand people looking
on hundreds of them looking down
from the windows of the woolworth
building and a dozen other buildings
how is it that not one single one of
them-not one mind you-notices a
man walk up to another man in a car
draw a revolver shoot him dead and
walk away i ask you

   its impossible joe thats all

   sure its impossible but it hap-
pened

   could it have been done with a
silencer asked nearow

   i guess so probably was with
the band and all of course even if

a man yelled nobodyd hear him out
there right behind the band

   well that may be true but that
still doesnt explain how a man could
stand there and draw a gun and aim it
and fire it without one single soul
noticing him objected the mayor

   could a man carry a revolver with
a silencer in a shoulder holster  asked
nearow meekly

   i guess so replied the chief  but
it would be as bulky and about as
awkward as a sawed-off shotgun

   stanis coat bulged on the left
side said nearow quietly

  the chief half rose gripping the
arms of his chair and -staring at
nearow the mayor pale again stared
at ahearn

   my god whispered ahearn

   he was jabbering something to
me said the mayor taking a folded
newspaper from his pocket and gave
me this but i couldnt make it out

   perhaps i can suggested nearow
and took the paper which proved to be
the first page of that days issue of the
italian daily of which stani was
editor

  nearow adjusted his spectacles and
scanned it

   ah he murmured pointing out
to them a three-column boxed editorial
in large type on the front page over
stanis signature

   i cant read dago protested the
chief

   ill give you a free translation or
better ill summarize it stani says
that for the last time-its headed  a
last warning -that he is warning
signors the mayor and commissioner
of police that they must not accept
medals from the present ruling faction
in italy that feeling runs high locally
between fascist and anti-fascist sym-
pathizers and that if the officials ac-
cept medals the police in any future
demonstrations will side against the
anti-fascists and riots and bloodshed
may follow at any cost he concludes
 signors the mayor and police commis-
the murder at city hall



sioner should be prevented from ac-
cepting these decorations thus aligning
themselves on the side of one faction in
a dispute in which no american officials
should participate this is our last
warning 

  a fanatic whispered the mayor

  he figured if he could keep pagano
away and do the speech making him-
self he could prevent it sure added
the chief greatly excited pounding his
fist on the mayors desk

   hes apt to bump off count
adelphi added the mayor

   come on shouted the chief
reaching back to his hip pocket as he
ran out the door

  in the hall they found pandemo-
nium

  it was packed with uniformed men
struggling to get into the double doors
of the assembly room from which a
roar of voices with an obbligato of
screams was issuing

  over the heads of the officers
nearow who is unusually tall could
see into the room with a milling crowd
sweeping back and forth on the
platform

   come on shouted ahearn to
nearow and the mayor and led the
way through a side door through an
office and into the little reception
room

  just as they arrived the doors lead-
ing to the assembly room platform
burst open and in came count adelphi
and the official party safe in the center
of a flying wedge of patrolmen

  behind them came another group of
policemen clinging to stani who was
screaming imprecations and putting up
an amazing fight for his small size

  the doors were quickly closed and
guarded shutting out the sound of the
bedlam

  ahearn ran over to stani and
calmed his men

   maybe ill be a martyr but i saved
my city from disgrace sic semper
tyrannus down with all fascisti
stani screamed

   did you search him  ahearn
asked

  one of the policemen handed him a
revolver nearow and the mayor ex-
amined it with interest

   perhaps he threw the silencer
away suggested nearow

  ahearn flung open stanis coat and
examined the holster

   couldnt have carried one in this
holster he said  no mark of it on
the revolver i dont think this guns
ever been fired its a thirty-two any-
how

  ahearn looked suddenly at professor
nearow

  phe mayor had hurried to reassure
count adelphi who though his clothes
were awry readjusted his monocle and
stood as cool as though he were at-
tending a lawn party

  nearow was thinking last trying to
reconstruct without bias from his
previous conclusions everything that
he had seen in its proper relationship

   why did you kill him ahearn
demanded of stani

   kill him asked stani in surprise
 kill who

   you know well enough who re-
torted the chief  unless you killed so
many that youve lost track- mean
congressman pagano

   is he dead stani cried clasping
his hands in happiness  glorious
thank the good god

   well you wont be so thankful
when you go to the chair retorted
ahearn

   me ah no it is another damn-
able fascist plot perhaps but i will
outwit them as i always outwit them
i do not fear them

  take him up to headquarters and
ill question him later the commis-
sioner ordered  hold him incom-
nnicada

  he flung open the double doors and
gazed into the empty assembly room
with its wreckage of broken chairs
the last of the crowd was going peace-
ably down the emergency stairway

herded between two lines of police
holding drawn clubs

 tuthat the hell happened any-
how ahearn asked craig-
willie who was standing near
by mopping his head and breathing
hard

   havent any idea muttered the
alderman  this fellow stani started
talking to em all excited as usual
first there was a cheer and then some
hissing and then somebody else ap-
plauded loudly and shouted and some
others started booing and waving
clenched fists and then suddenly a fist
fight started down among the audience
and first thing you know the whole
mob was fighting and some of them
rushed up on the platform after stani
and others rushed up to do battle to
save him and-

   believe me brother i never been
so scared in my life im usually
pretty cool

   its a marvel a miracle nobody got
stabbed the commissioner declared
 well t guess this is hearts and
flowers for me the last straw wait
till the papers get this

   say i just heard that poor pagano
got bumped off too bad

   i guess you aint any sorrier than
i am from all  hear about his holding
your syndicate up for protection
money

   nonsense retorted craigwillie
writh a show of indignation  we
were great friends and i was the last
one to see him alive dont you think
that means nothing

   i know you were professor nea-
row here saw you

  craigwillie looked quickly at nea-
row and then a slow smile wreathed
his heavy face

 say maybe i aint lucky to have
an alibi witness-and a college per-
fesser too can you beat that hey
 well you wont need him im
thinking well have a confession out of

stani pretty quick that kind of a
nut always wants to boast to the world
about what hes done

   you know commissioner burning
in the chairs too good for a guy like
that

  he walked away shaking his head

   mr commissioner do you think
you could discreetly have every man
present here searched

   i get you professor you think
one of them might be a confederate
and have taken the gun sure youre
right we got to search every one if
we search any

  the commissioner with great tact
explained what he proposed to do and
even count adelphi and the mayor
consented to be searched by the de-
tectives

  several of the men carried revolvers
each of them had a permit

  an examination of the barrels of the
weapons showed that not a one had
been fired since last being cleaned

  nearow was as chagrined as the
chief and took his leave after promis-
ing to testify or appear whenever
wanted

  it was while he was claiming his top
hat from the old policeman in the little
check room off the reception room that
he suddenly remembered what he had
forgotten and leaned over and whis-
pered a word or two

   he wants me to take it down to
the car with me he added aloud

   look out now sir its real heavy
and he warned me its right off the
boat and of the best said the old
check room keeper as he handed nea-
row a slightly bulging brief case
 sure and i wish i could open it with
you

   indeed i do too smiled nearow
and went down and out of city hall

  he stood for a moment in perplex-
ity and then spied sergeant mac mur-
rachu

   sergeant will you kindly go up
to the reception room and ask the com-
missioner to come down at once as i
the murder at city iiau

have something of the greatest impor-
tance to show him

  the sergeant dubiously entered city
hall and nearow walked toward pa-
ganos car which stood just as it had
been when he had first seen it

  the police however not only re-
fused to let him see it but ordered him
to move along desisting when he ex-
plained he was waiting for the com-
missioner

  ahearn appeared on the steps and
was immediately besieged by a horde
of young men who had been kept from
entering city hall by the line of police

  he pleaded with them for a moment
then argued then beckoned to his men
who surrounded the group and kept
them on the steps while ahearn walked
over to nearow

   the newspaper men he explained
 ive got to give them a statement in
five minutes but i dont know what i
can say that wont ruin me

  nearow looked back the young
men were looking sullenly at the com-
missioner

   would you mind sitting in the
car nearow asked the commissioner
 ive suddenly had a great light

   youre very mysterious grum-
bled the chief good-naturedly as he sat
behind the wheel where pagano had
been slain  but if you think theres a
secret gun in the car or anything like
that im afraid my men would have
discovered it long ago

  ahearn had both hands on the wheel
and was sitting back looking pleasant-
ly and tolerantly down upon the pro-
fessor who was standing close in the
open door of the car fumbling with
the flap of the brief case

   suppose said nearow tugging at
the lock  that i said this minute that
i was about to take ten thousand dol-
lars in cash out of this brief case and
hand it to you to keep what would
you do

   take another drink of the same
hop replied ahearn with a laugh

   seriously now suppose you had

asked or perhaps demanded the ten
thousand dollars and i walked up to
you and said here it is take it-

   why replied ahearn half seri-
ous and all curious  id take it of
course can  help you get that open 
its locked isnt it

   ill get it replied nearow and
taking a firm hold he suddenly ripped
open the flap

  he reached carefully down into the
brief case as ahearn watched with in-
terest

  on the steps the newspaper men and
nearer sergeant mac murrachu and his
men were all watching with uncon-
cealed curiosity

  nearow suddenly whipped his hand
out and fired a shot from the pistol it
held

  the bullet passed bare inches from
ahearns arm and buried itself in the
upholstery

  the silencer on the weapon had muf-
fled the sound so that in the open air
the police standing a few feet away
had not heard it above the city noises

  nearow was leaning in the open
door which hid the weapon from the
onlookers

  ahearns face was gray

  nearow was grinning triumphantly

   my god man whispered ahearn
hoarsely  are you mad  give me that
gun

   i will be if you dont see instantly
what im getting at said nearow
brightly handing it over

   its slowly dawning sighed
ahearn resting his clammy forehead
in his hand for a moment he looked
faint but his color soon returned

   you know he went on  for a
moment i thought you were the killer
-absolutely cuckoo but if youve
any heart at all dont ever give me any
more practical demonstrations ill
take your word from now on

   its not stanis weapon said
nearow slowly

   its not then whos is it

   who had pagano been asking for


detective fiction weekly

protection money for his illicit liquor
business

   you dont mean craigwillie 
  nearow nodded

   great guns man how did you
know about the protection and liquor
and all

   you told me yourself

  did i really i must guard my
tongue but how can we prove its
his weapon

   possibly by his finger-prints pos-
sibly by finding upon him the key that
fits this brief case certainly by the
testimony of one of your own police-
men with whom craigwillie checked
the brief case in the check room up
there

  what the nerve of that guy
first he bumps off his enemy under
my nose with half the policemen in
town standing around and then he
checks the gun with a copper can
you beat that

  what else could he do i dont
think he planned it probably realized
all of a sudden what a golden oppor-
tunity he had there and took advantage
of it and decided if he told the check-
room man it was extra special liquor
it would be safer than if he carried it
around himself

  but what made you think of it
 when i got my own hat i was
thinking back trying to remember if
there was anything id forgotten and
then suddenly i remembered craig-
willie had held tight to a brief case as
he pushed through the crowd

   somewhere id read that revolvers
with silencers are more often carried
in bags or packages than on the per-
son i thought it was a wild chance
and asked if mr craigwillie had left
a brief case and when he said yes
and i felt its shape and weight i was
pretty sure the officer thought it was
liquor

  but i thought you said pagano
was alive and waved to craigwillie
after craigwillie started off

   i did and he was and did nearow
replied  as soon as i was sure craig-
willie had done it and set out to recon-
cile the apparent contradiction of my
own eyes i realized the true signifi-
cance of what i saw

   craigwillie stood in the open door
whipped out the gun - which was
hidden from everybody even myself
and i was just coming up-fired a
bullet right into paganos heart saw
me coolly called good-by slammed the
door and hurried away

   what i saw instead of being pa-
ganos good-by to craigwillie was his
farewell to life-he cried out raised
his arm spasmodically and slumped
forward over the wheel at the mo-
ment i thought he was leaning over
to shut off or to start his motor the
band was thumping right there and if
he had screamed his loudest not a soul
would have heard him through the
closed doors of his car

   amazing will you accept an ap-
pointment as honorary deputy commis-
sioner

   but i thought you were sure you
would lose your office

   oh ill pull through all right but
-ho hell

   whats the matter asked profes-
sor nearow

   i wish it had been stani open
and shut craigwillie has all the pull
in the world and the best criminal law-
yers in new york

   ill make the pinch right now and
ill get him indicted and tried and
convicted but hell appeal and get a
new trial and finally liell get off with
about ten years say the chairs too
good for a fellow like that

   exactly what he said himself re-

                          a true story

      a tale of a terrible vengeance-the actual facts that
      inspired the great novel  the count of monte cristo 

                  by robert w sneddon

 among napoleons subjects in
paris was a young man from the
  provinces who was making a
good living as a shoemaker

  francois picaud good-looking was
somewhat of a dandy for all his trade
and had managed to win the love of
an attractive and pretty girl with some
money of her own he was crazy
about the girl and proud of his con-

quest as the original says among
this class of people there is only one
way to have a woman to marry her
one sunday the prospective bride-
groom dressed up in his best clothes
went to have a glass of wine in a cafe
kept by a friend about his own age
he was richer which did not prevent
him having an overwhelming envy of
his prosperous neighbors

  loupian who came from the south-
ern city of nimes as did picaud
had his cafe and wineshop in a good
location near saint opportune place
he was a widower with two children

  when picaud came in there were
three other southerners in the cafe
men whom he knew quite well

  well heres friend picaud dressed
up fit to kill said loupian  there
must be something in the wind he
winked at the others

   there is said picaud simply as
he sat down  im going to get
married

   and who have you picked out to be
unfaithful to you asked one of the
company named allut

the lucky lover

  as the others enlarged on the sub-
ject so dear to the writers of french
farce picaud grew angry and had to
be pacified

   all joking aside said loupian at
last  whom are you marrying friend
picaud

  you may not believe it said
picaud but the girl is the heiress
therese vigouroux

   why she has a hundred thousand
francs in her own name cried the
astounded proprietor of the cafe

  well i can give her that amount
in love and happiness said picaud
stoutly  meanwhile gentlemen i
want you all to come to the mass which
will be said in saint leus and to the
dance after the wedding feast-were
having it at latignacs in bear street
the four men could hardly believe
the evidence of their ears picaud cer-
tainly was a lucky man if the news was
true

   when is the wedding to come off
loupian asked

   tuesday

   this tuesday

  yes dont forget ill expect you
all there im going over to the
mayors office now to make the final ar-
rangements

picaud hurried off briskly

   well what do you make of that
   hes a wizard

   getting such a beautiful girl and
money to burn

  loupian sat scowling as the others
talked suddenly he looked up

   getting married on tuesday is
he i bet you he doesnt

 what do you mean asked allut
 i bet you ill put off the wedding
ill play a trick on picaud hes too
cocky about himself he needs to be
taken down a peg

  whats the idea loupian

  well suppose i tell the police
picaud is acting as a spy for the eng-
lish see theyll take him to the station
and keep him there while they in-
vestigate that will keep the bride
waiting a aveek at least it will be a
good joke

   its a joke picaud wont appre-
ciate said allut warningly if he
finds out you did it hell be revenged
on you i know picaud dont do it

a practical joke

   oh shut up dont be a spoil sport
this is carnival time let us have our
fun

   leave me out of it then said
allut  i warn you you are laying up
trouble for yourselves

   bah said loupian  you havent
the courage of a chicken

   i have some sense of decency
shouted allut  good night and
dont say i didnt warn you to keep
off picaud

  the others burst into jeering laugh-
ter as the door shut and loupian being
generous with his wine they approved
of his plan he promised them he
would give them something to laugh
over

  about two hours later he went to a
police station and told his story the
officer wrote a report and sent it at
once to the head of the secret police
it came in at a bad time when the
authorities were bothered with rebel-
the killer who couldnt forget



lions of the royalists in the province of
la vendee they jumped at the con-
clusion that picaud was acting as an
agent between royalists in the west and
south and was carrying on the trade of
shoemaking as a blind for his real
business

  in those days conspirators were
dealt with at once so that night or
rather in the early morning police
descended on picauds residence and
removed him so secretly that his ab-
sence was not known until the morn-
ing of the wedding no trace of him
could be found and finally his
friends gave up all hope of seeing him
again

prisoners released

  the years rolled on in  the
imperial government crashed to the
ground and on april  the doors of
the fortress of fenestrelle opened to
let out a prisoner he was a man bent
with suffering aged by despair rather
than the passage of years in seven
years he had lived half a century
nobody who had once known him
could have recognized him he stared
at a strangers face when he saw his
own in the first mirror he had gazed
into for seven years in the miserable
inn at fenestrelle

  this man who had been known in
prison as joseph lucher had there
formed the acquaintance of an enor-
mously wealthy ecclesiastic of milan
whose relatives had contrived to have
him imprisoned in order to enjoy his
vast revenues the ecclesiastic had
disappointed them and kept to himself
the knowledge that he had huge sums
of money in the banks of hamburg
and england furthermore he had
sold the greater part of his estates to an
italian prince and lodged the proceeds
with an amsterdam banker

  this noble italian dying on janu-

lucher sole heir to seven million
francs and disclosed to him the secret
hiding place of over a million francs

worth of diamonds and three million
francs in coin milanese ducats vene-
tian florins spanish crowns french

  joseph lucher when he had re-
covered his strength and resumed the

treasure he had come to seek with in

burg and london and having the

amonds the rest he placed in invest-
ments bringing him an income of six
hundred thousand francs payable by

lucher learns

  this business concluded joseph
lucher set out to paris where he ar-
rived on february   eight
years to a day since the unfortunate
francois picaud had disappeared so
mysteriously picaud would have been
thirty-four years old

  lucher fell sick the day after he had
arrived in paris and as he had no
house or servants had himself taken to
a hospital he was still there when
napoleon returned from exile to paris
and did not come out of hospital until
the emperor had been defeated and
louis eighteenth came back to the
throne for the second time he then
left the hospital and established him-
self in humble lodgings in the saint
opportune district where he learned
several happenings

  one of them was that in february
of  the good people of the district
had been puzzled by the disappearance
of a young shoemaker on the eve of his
wedding three friends had played

some sort of a joke on him and the
poor devil had run away or been kid-
naped no one knew what had been
his fate

  the bride-to-be had wept and
mourned him for two years and then
giving up all hope of ever seeing her
lover again had married loupian a
cafe proprietor who through his
wealthy marriage had prospered so
well that he now had one of the most
magnificent and popular cafes on the
boulevards

trails beginning

  joseph lucher listened to this story
without showing any apparent interest
or making any comment he made fur-
ther inquiries in a quiet way but found
no one who could tell him the authors
of the great joke which had sent an
innocent man to exile or death

  at last he did find one man who told
him

   i once heard a certain antoine
allut say in front of me that he knew
the men who did it

   i once knew an allut in italy he
came from nimes

   so did this one i speak of

   the allut i knew said lucher
 lent me a hundred crowns and told
me to pay them to his cousin antoine
 why dont you send the money to
nimes i believe he went there to
live said luchers informant

  the next day a post chaise preceded
bv a courier who paid thrice the usual
hiring charges flew rather than
whirled on the highway to lyons
from there the conveyance followed
the rhone by the marseilles road
which it left at saint esprit bridge

  at this point a man dressed as an
italian abbe got out of the chaise he
engaged another conveyance and drove
to nimes where he put up at the well-
known luxembourg hotel he quietly
questioned the people in the hotel
whether they knew an antoine allut
and found out there were many of this
name in all stations of life

  some time passed before the abbe
baldini as he said his name was was
able to trace the object of his quest
and several days before he came into
relations with him

  he told allut after several meet-
ings that lie had been a political pris-
oner in the chateau de loeuf of
naples which stands on an island in
the port of this city and that he had
there met a good fellow who much to
his regret had died in 

   at this time continued the abbe
 lie was about thirty he died mourn-
ing his lost country but he pardoned
those responsible for his imprisonment
he was a man from nimes his name
was francois picaud

  allut uttered a smothered exclama-
tion the abbe looked at him with an
amazed expression

   did you happen to know this
picaud he asked

   he was one of my best friends
and to think of him dying so far from
home said allut with emotion  did
you ever learn the reason for his ar-
rest

a diamond legacy

   he did not know it himself i am
sure of that for he swore to me by
everything sacred that he was ig-
norant

  allut sighed it might have been a
sigh of relief

  the abbe continued

   while picaud was alive he had
but one thought he was ready to
give his share of heaven to the person
who would tell him the names of the
author or the authors of his arrest
and this obsession inspired him to make
a peculiar will but first i should tell
you that picaud in prison was able to
be of great service to an english man
a prisoner like himself and when this
man died he left picaud a diamond
worth at lowest valuation fifty thou-
sand francs

   lucky fellow to get a legacy like
that said allut sighing a man
tiie killer who couldnt forget



can do a lot with fifty thousand francs
its a fortune

   when picaud was on his death-
bed the abbe resumed  he sent for
me and said  i can die happy if you
give me your word to do as i ask will
you promise me i gave him my
word knowing he would not ask me to
do anything contrary to honor or reli-
gion i asked him what it was he
said  i have never been able to learn
the names of those who cast me into
this hell but i have had a revelation
the voice of god has told me one of
my friends a native of nimes by the
name of antoine allut knows those
who betrayed me when you receive
your freedom go and find him and
for my sake give him the diamond i
got from sir herbert newton but
only on this condition that he gives
you the names of those whom i regard
as my murderers when he tells you
the names you will return to naples
and have them engraved on a metal
plate over my grave 

three names

  antoine allut after consideration
said he was willing to meet the terms
of the bequest only he was afraid and
must consult his wife he returned
next day and gave the abbe the names
of gervais chaubard guilhem solari
and finally that of gilles loupian

  the ring was handed over to allut
who negotiated its sale to a dealer in
precious stones for the sum of sixty-
three thousand seven hundred and
forty-nine francs in cash four months
later to the fury and chagrin of the
alluts the stone was sold to a turkish
merchant for three times the amount
this led to a dispute and the dispute
led to a murder that of the dealer
facing prison death and total ruin the
alluts had to flee and took refuge in
greece

  one day a splendidly dressed lady
entered the cafe kept by loupian and
asked to see the proprietor she told
loupian that her family was under

great obligations to a poor fellow
ruined by the events of  but that
he refused to accept anything but her
recommendation for a position all he
wanted was to get a place as waiter in
some establishment where he would be
treated kindly he was no longer
young and looked to be about fifty to
persuade loupian to take him the lady
would pay a hundred francs a month
which payment the wraiter was not to
know of

  loupian agreed a man presented
himself as the waiter badly clothed
and ugly looking he saw both loupian
and his wife and was set to waiting on
the tables

the missing groom

  among the regular customers of the
cafe were the two nimes men chau-
bard and solari they dropped in
every day at the same time had a
drink read the papers played cards or
dominoes

  one night chaubard did not appear
the usual joking remarks about having
met some lady were passed and solari
had to find another partner

  next night he arrived breathless he
had just been called to the morgue to
look at the body of chaubard tound
lying in a nook near the pont des arts
bridge with a dagger through the heart

  the police were powerless to dis-
cover the murderer who seemed to
have left no trace behind him

  two weeks later a handsome hunt-
ing dog belonging to loupian died of
poison a boy said he had seen a cus-
tomer feeding biscuits to the dog and
described him this was a young man
who drove the mail cart and liked to
poke fun at loupian he was able to
prove an alibi-luckily for him seven
days went by and madames favorite
parrot also was poisoned

  loupian by his first marriage had
a daughter now aged sixteen she
was ravishingly beautiful a dandy
who said he was a marquis and a mil-
lionaire saw her one day in the cafe


detective fiction weekly

he spent money like water to have
meetings with the girl bribing the
waiters and the maidservants the
inevitable happened when the girl was
betrayed the loupians insisted that
the marquis must marry the girl and
he consented and as evidence of good
faith showed his documents of iden-
tification and the titles of his estates
the loupian family was overjoyed

  the marriage ceremony was carried
through and a splendid wedding feast
was ordered in a fashionable restaur-
ant covers were laid for one hundred
and fifty guests

  at the appointed hour the guests
were all present the marquis alone
was missing he had excused himself
on the pretext that he had been sum-
moned to the kings presence as the
guests waited a letter arrived from the
missing groom begging that the dinner
be gone on with and that he would join
them later

 one 

  as the evening went on a great un-
easiness pervaded the company and the
laughter died away the bride sat with
her eyes upon the door expecting the
coming of the handsome groom every
instant

  when the dessert was served one of
the waiters laid a letter beside the plate
of each guest in curt and brutal
terms it stated that the so-called mar-
quis was an ex-convict and was now in
flighle these letters had been left by
a stranger who had hurried away

  the consternation of the loupian
family may be imagined they could
not imagine why they should be the
target for such a misfortune

  but worse was to follow four
days later on a sunday while all the
family was in the country in search of
distraction for their worries the apart-
ment over the cafe went on fire in
several places

  a rabble of people came running
and under the pretense of helping to
extinguish the flames and carry out the

furniture pillaged damaged and
destroyed everything the flames could
not be put out and the whole building
was ruined what property had been
removed had been carried off

  loupian was a ruined man all that
was left to himwas a little of his wifes
property his friends left him alone
the only person who stuck to him was
the waiter prosper whom he had en-
gaged on the recommendation of the
lady prosper said he would follow
him and serve him for his board so
loupian opened a tiny cafe in st an-
toine street and gradually old cus-
tomers began to come again

  among them was solari who after
a visit to the cafe was one night
seized with atrocious pains and in
spite of the efforts of a doctor died in
agony a few hours later

two 

  twelve hours later wdien his bier
was exposed as was the custom then
in front of the house where he lodged
a paper was found pinned to the cover-
ing of the coffin on it wras printed
the single word- two

  loupians other child was a son who
allowred himself to be drawn into evil
ways he was running around with a
gang of others of his own age who
seemed to have lured him into their
society one night it was proposed that
tlie gang should rob a wine shop carry
off twelve bottles drink them and pay
for them next day-all as a great
prank eugene loupian thought this
was great sport and accompanied the
gang

  everything went off nicely the
gang was just ready to steal out
with a couple of bottles apiece when
the police surrounded the juvenile
criminals some one had squealed
only the royal clemency saved the
boy from death as it was he was
given twenty years in prison

  this catastrophe completed the ruin
of loupian mme loupian died of
shame and worry and as she left no

 d

children the remains of her dowry
went back to her family loupian and
his daughter were penniless

  at this point the faithful prosper
said he had managed to lay by quite
a sum of savings and that mademoiselle
might have them-at a price the dis-
appointed bride to save her father and
lift them out of ruin threatening them
yielded finally and sold herself

  loupian existed he no longer
lived his misfortunes had reduced
him to a state where his brain no longer
would work one night as he was
walking in an unfrequented path in the
tuileries gardens a man wearing a
mask stepped from behind a tree

three

   loupian said this man harshly
do you recall the year 
loupian stared blankly

   why  he said dully

   remember the crime you com-
mitted at that period

   crime-crime

  yes an infamous crime when
jealousy led you to plunge your friend
picaud into the depths of a dungeon
now do you remember

   ah sighed loupian  i remem-
ber god has punished me severely
the masked man drew nearer the
wretched man could feel the intensity
of the burning gaze which was cast
upon him through the eyeholes of the
mask

   not god has punished you lou-
pian but picaud picaud himself who
to satisfy his revenge stabbed chau-
bard on pont des arts bridge who
poisoned solari gave you a criminal
as son-in-law and devised the trap into
which your son fell it was picaud
who killed your dog and your wifes
parrot who set fire to your house and
hired the robbers who ruined you it
is picaud who caused your wife to die
of grief and made your daughter his
mistress

  the speaker snatched off his mask
and as loupian recoiled cried

   d

   yes i am prosper-and i was
picaud and your knowledge dies with
you

  as the dagger in his hand buried
itself deep in the heart of loupian who
sank to his knees without a cry the
avenger uttered a strange sound then
turned to go

  but at that moment a grip of steel
seized him by the throat picaud
attacked from behind by a man who
had followed him was soon overcome
gagged and bound his assailant
wrapped his cloak about him and pick-
ing him up in strong arms carried him
swiftly away

  nothing could exceed the fury and
astonishment of picaud as bound hand
and foot he was carried away surely
he had not fallen into the hands of the
police a single gendarme would have
summoned others before attempting an
arrest of this kind his attacker was
a footpad then but why should he
be carrying him away this person who
had been the sole spectator of the mur-
der just committed

picauds accomplice

  his head enveloped in his cloak
picaud had no idea where he was being
taken after a time he was flung upon
a cot of some kind the air of the
place was heavy and sound was
muffled the cloak was snatched from
the prisoners eyes

  overhead was an arch of stone he
fancied he must be in an abandoned
quarry he peered at his captor who
sitting on a stone watched him without
saying a word

   at last his jailer spoke

   well picaud what name will you
use in future the one your father
gave you or the one you assumed when
you came out of prison will you call
yourself abbe baldini or prosper the
waiter i wonder if youll be clever
enough to invent a fifth name for your-
self i hope youre satisfied with your
revenge now you must have sold
your soul to a demon or youd be filled


detective fiction weekly

  with horror of what you have done
you have spent ten years of your life
persecuting three wretched creatures
you might have spared you have com-
mitted horrible crimes and now you
are lost forever since you drew me into
 

the abyss

  who are you asked picaud

   i am your accomplice a wretch
who sold you the lives of his friends
for gold your gold was my ruin you
kindled a flame of greed in my soul
which has never gone out i killed the
jeweler who had cheated me and i had
to flee with my wife she died in exile
i was captured sentenced sent to the
galleys i have endured every misery
and dragged the hateful ball and chain

dupes vengeance

   when i managed to escape i had
but one desire to find and punish this
abbe baldini who had made such an
art of punishment i hastened to
naples no one had heard of him
there i looked for the grave of picaud
and learned that picaud still lived
how did i learn this neither you nor
the pope will ever extort the secret

   henceforth i devoted myself to
the pursuit of this man who pretended
to be dead but when i had found him
already two murders showed his re-
venging hand loupian had lost his
home his children his wife his for-
tune to-night i followed him i was
going to tell him the whole story to
warn him but again you got ahead of
me-some devil must have given you
warning-and i was too late to save
him from you but i have you-so
we are quits i am going to pay you
back the evil you have done i am
going to prove that where we come
from we have arms as well as
memories picaud now you know
me i am antoine allut

  picaud said nothing strange fan-
cies were passing through his mind

  carried away by the passion of re-
venge he had almost forgotten the
vastness of his wealth and the pleasures

  it could give to him but now his ven-
geance was accomplished and he might
think of the richness of life before him
he had fallen into the hands of a man
as lacking in the quality of mercy as
he himself had been

  as these reflections sped rapidly
through his brain he bit on his gag
with impotent fury but gradually he
gathered his wits together he had
been able to buy this man before surely
he could buy him again he could
spare him a hundred thousand francs
out of his sixteen millions

  and then the state of poverty in
which he had lived to accomplish his
revenge began to pervade his reasoning
powers why should he give away
any of his money he would pretend
he was no better than a beggar and buy
his freedom for a small sum once
free he would see that allut would
disgorge this amount

  meanwhile allut removed the gag
   where am i  asked picaud

   you are in a place where you need
expect no help nor pity you are mine
and mine only to do with as i please
picaud smiled disdainfully his
former friend said nothing more but
left him lying on the cot

money for bread

   in a little while he returned and fixed
a wide heavy band of iron about the
prisoners waist secured by a chain to
three large rings embedded in the wall
that done he set out some food on
a cask on end and began to eat
picaud watched him for some time
 i am hungry

   what will you pay for some bread
and water

   i have no money

   you have sixteen millions and
more said allut quietly  and i
know exactly where they are

  with the utmost precision he de-
tailed the various sums invested in
several countries of europe

  you are dreaming faltered pi-
caud aghast
the killer who couldnt forget



   well dream that you are eating
allut retorted

  he left the prisoner alone all night
but returned to eat his breakfast be-
fore him

   give me something to eat asked
picaud

  what will you pay

   nothing

   have your own way wrell see
who gives in first

  when he returned again with food
picaud said he would pay a few coppers
for a loaf of bread

   listen to me said allut after a
time  here are my conditions ill
give you a meal twice a day and youll
pay me twenty-five thousand francs for
each meal

  picaud uttered a flood of protests

   that is my last offer said allut
unemotionally  think it over you
had no mercy for your friends why
should i have any

  the wretched prisoner passed the
rest of the day and the following night
torn with hunger and despair burning
in a hell of his own contriving his
sufferings were such that he was on
the borderland between life and death
when the merciless allut saw that he
had pushed his revenge too far picaud
was nothing but flesh still sensitive to
physical pain but incapable of doing
anything to combat it there was no
use trying to make him speak

  for a time allut stood looking down
at the prisoner thinking that if he died
all hope of appropriating any part of
his immense fortune would be lost to
him

  suddenly he bent down and struck
the face of the prisoner a mocking
expression passed across it and sud-
denly allut lost control of himself and
threw himself on the prostrate man
and only when he was dead did he
come to his senses then with a shud-
der of disgust he fled leaving the body
behind him

  he made for england where he
lived until  in that year know-

ing his end was within a few hours he
sent for a french catholic priest and
made him take down his story and that
of the other unhappy men to be sent
to the prefect of police of paris this
the priest did and the unhappy allut
signed the document on each page

  this document was conveyed to the
prefect and placed in the archives or
files together with a plan showing
where the bones of picaud would be
found and the addresses at which pi-
caud had stayed under his two names

  allut said that he had searched but
had not found any documents or money
of the dead man but had knowledge
of his enormous fortune

   even on his deathbed said the
priest in his signed letter  antoine
allut refused to tell me by what means
he had learned the facts set down in
his memoir or who had informed him
of the doings crimes and fortune of
picaud only an hour before he died
and in full possession of his faculties
he said to me  father no mans belief
can be more alive than mine i swear
as i am about to face my maker that

i	both heard and saw a spirit separated
from its body 

  picauds history has been made im-
mortal in literature in  the
famous author dumas was looking
round for a skeleton plot to fit the title
monte cristo the name of a rock near
elba and he undoubtedly found it in
the archives of this unusual case of
picaud though his genius has turned
a crude story into superb masterpiece

  picaud became dantes therese
mercedes loupian turned into fer-
nand and allut to caderonsse the
abbe baldini was transformed into
abbe busoni and as for the prison it
is easy to recognize the chateau dlf
in the chateau de loeuf

  the novel and its original begin al-
most in the same way-the heros ap-
proaching marriage and his betrayal
by a jealous rival and those who know
 monte cristo  must have discovered
other close similarities in the two plots

   i dont suppose he will be agreed
chief inspector dransfield placidly
 but we cant afford to take any risks
thats where you unofficial folks score
you neednt act on everything you
hear but if we at the yard neglect
the slightest clew however unpromis-
ing we never hear the end of it

  paul grinned  youre an extreme-
ly ill-used body of men he scoffed
regarding the broad sturdy figure of
his friend with appreciation  i can
see you positively fading away under
the strain have we time for a drink 
chief inspector dransfield glanced at
the illuminated clock overhead

  just time i tkink he decided
promptly

  it was a slack period at the big lon-
don railway terminus the theater
rush was over and comparative calm
would reign until the cinemas and other
places of amusement disgorged their
hurrying crowds all intent on reaching
their homes with the least possible de-
lay nevertheless there was still
plenty of bustle and confusion on the

wfp

 i wonder
if this is mr
baxter he said

   the two men walked across to a re-
freshment room and ordered drinks
despite the fact that dransfield held a
high official position at scotland yard
while paul grendon was a private in-
vestigator they were great friends
very frequently they would work to-
gether each in his own way on a case
and such a case had brought them to
the railway station to-night

  they were hoping without much
conviction that the arrival of the eight
forty-five would bring to a satisfac-
tory conclusion a very involved forgery
investigation in which they were both
interested word had come to drans-
field by an underground route that the
man they wanted would return to lon-

                                    don by this train and though they
both considered the information highly
unreliable it was necessary as the in-
iong platforms and departing trains spector had pointed out to pursue any

death on the 



  having emptied their glasses they
strolled back into the station the
train they were expecting-a boat ex-
press-was due and a few moments
later it rolled in with a noisy grinding
of brakes

  from the position they had taken up
they could scrutinize the alighting pas-
sengers as they hurried along the plat-
form it very quickly became apparent
that the man they sought had not trav-
eled by this train

   well well have to try again
sighed dransfield philosophically
 lets have another drink

  he was turning away when paul
caught his arm

   look at the postman old chappie
under that third light what do you
thinks bitten him

  at the front of the train next to the
engine was a mail van at the door
of this which he had just unlocked
stood a uniformed man gazing into the
van with startled surprise evident in
his attitude as the two friends
watched he banged the door to and
ran past them down the platform to-
ward the station masters office

   something queer in that van mur-
mured paul  any business of ours
do you think

   better wait and see what happens
advised dransfield lingering his heavy
mustache

  very soon the postman came run-
ning back accompanied by the station
master and a railway policeman as
they passed the station master caught
sight of dransfield and recognized him

   come along inspector he panted
 just the man we want the mail
vans been robbed and a sorter killed
paul and dransfield hurried after
the others the postman unlocked the
door of the mail van again and stood
aside to allow them all to enter then
he climbed in and pulled the door to
after him shutting out the crowd that
had already begun to collect

  there was little sign of any disturb-
ance in the van the labeled mail bags

were stacked in a row and hundreds of
letters were neatly arranged in the sort-
ing stand on a cleared space on the
counter stood a lighted primus stove
with teapot and cups beside it the
only indication that anything was
wrong was the body that lay sprawled
in one corner and the pungent odor of
chloroform that tilled the van with its
sickly sweetness

  dransfield bent down to examine the
man and removed the thick wad of
cotton wool that was tied over his
month and nose with a handkerchief

   hes not dead he said slipping a
hand inside the mans waistcoat  hes
only chloroformed but he looks pret-
ty bad to me we cant do anything
for him better get a doctor i think
the railway policeman departed to
telephone for the doctor dransfield
turned to the postman

   do you know this man  he asked
pointing to the unconscious figure
 hes a sorter

   yes sir i know him well wal-
ter selwyns his name hes worked
on this train for years and i meet it
more often than not

   but surely he doesnt travel alone 
oh no ronald baxter always
works with him

   and wheres mr baxter now old
chappie drawled paul fingering the
handkerchief which had been tied over
selwyns face

  the postman looked helplessly
round the van it was clear that he
had been so upset by his discovery of
the one sorter apparently dead that he
had temporarily forgotten the ex-
istence of the other

   he-he ought to be here sir he
stammered  or some one in his place
selwyn would not be allowed to come
up alone

   perhaps he slipped out of the van
before you arrived

   he couldnt do that i was wait-
ing on the platform when the train
came in i was surprised that no one
opened the door of the mail van usu-

ally either selwyn or baxter jumps out
as soon as the train stops i couldnt
see into the van because the windows
are frosted after knocking and get-
ting no reply i unlocked the door my-
self

   you said there had been a rob-
bery queried dransfield i dont
see any signs of it what makes you
think so

   this sir the postman laid a
hand on one of the mail bags which lay
open  registered letters and parcels
sir it ought to be closed and sealed
neither selwyn nor baxter had any
authority to touch it

   but youre not sure whether any-
thing has gone from it

   not without checking the sheets
sir

   that can wait if the bag ought
to be sealed its pretty evident some
ones been tampering with it

  dransfields thoughtful gaze re-
turned to the unconscious man on the
floor and noted something on his wrist

   hello he said  his wrist watch
is broken if it has stopped it will
give us the time when he was attacked
the front of the watch was cracked
and portions of the glass had fallen
away the hands had stopped at eight
twenty

   twenty minutes past eight said
the inspector unfastening the watch
 wthere would the train be at that
time mr rees

  the station master made a rapid cal-
culation

  if it was running to schedule he
replied  it would be about seven
beeches thirty miles this side of wye-
chester

   well thats something drans-
field put the watch in his pocket and
rose to his feet again  we have evi-
dence that selwyn was attacked some-
where in the neighborhood of seven
beeches now whats happened to
baxter theres no place here where
he could be hidden

   he may have been thrown out of

the van suggested the station master
 in any case id better telephone down
the line to have a thorough search
made

    wish you would please agreed
dransfield and the station master hur-
ried off

  looking about for any further in-
formation dransfield discovered an
empty bottle which had rolled behind a
mail bag he picked it up gingerly
avoiding finger-marking the glass and
sniffed at it

   wre may learn something from
this he said wrapping the bottle in a
handkerchief  its had chloroform
in it

  paul grendon was wandering around
the van keen eyes searching in every
corner he tried the door at the rear
end of the van which was intended to
link it up with the next carriage if de-
sired and found that it was unfastened

   perhaps mr baxter went out this
way he suggested  i suppose this
door ought to be locked

   yes sir regulations are strict
about that

   would either of the sorters have a
key

   theres one kept in the van i think
for use in any emergency

   thats not very hopeful mur-
mured paul

  he opened the door and looked out
the van was not connected by the usu-
al collapsible passage to the next car-
riage in fact this was of an old type
containing no corridor it had no door
corresponding with that of the mail
van there was no means by which any
one could pass from one carriage to the
other

   must have been difficult either to
enter or leave this van while the train
was on the move he said thoughtfully

   some one might have swung along
the footboards suggested inspector
dransfield

   possibly but the postman says the
door at the side was locked theres
the top of the train of course paul
death on the 



looked up  hello hello whats
this

   projecting from the top of the next
carriage was a leg with its foot caught
in one of the climbing rungs

   i wonder if this is mr baxter
he said

  he climbed up between the two car-
riages on the top of the one behind
the mail van the body of a man lay
sprawled on his face

   paul flashed his electric torch the
man was dead and the back of his
head battered to a pulp was sufficient
evidence of the cause

  something lodged among the accu-
multed dust in the angle between a bat-
ten and the ventilator glinted as the
light caught it paul picked up one or
two small pieces of thin glass whis-
tling tunelessly between his teeth he
stowed them carefully away in his
pocket then aided by the other two
he lowered the limp figure down

  as soon as the body was laid on the
floor of the van the postman recog-
nized it

    its baxter he cried  its poor
old baxter

   looks as though he was after the
thieves said dransfield  but poor
devil that head whatever could-
 a bridge replied paul briefly
 he was caught as the train went un-
der a bridge it would have swept him
clear away if his foot hadnt become
entangled in the rung

    i expect youre right

    theres no doubt about it strange
that he was so careless isnt it of
course he was facing the wrong way
but he must have known every inch of
the line

    well if he was all flurried and ex-
cited chasing after the thieves-

   im not sure that he was chasing
after the thieves paul picked up the
handkerchief which had held the chlo-
roformed pad over selwyns face and
pointed to one corner of it  theres
something to think about here look
at it

  plainly written in indelible ink on
the handkerchief was the name  r
baxter

  by crimes exclaimed dransfield
 that alters the whole thing doesnt
it

   i believe it does old chappie

   it means that baxter himself was
the thief he chloroformed selwyn
took what he wanted and-

ii

the inspectors exposition of his
theory was cut short by the re-
turn of the station master ac-
companied by a dapper emotionless po-
lice surgeon the situation was briefly
explained to them after examining
baxter the surgeon definitely agreed
with paul about the bridge

   im sure nothing else could have
caused such injuries he said emphat-
ically  the back of his skull is
smashed in like an empty egg shell
and his legs broken by the force with
which he was thrown back on the car-
riage behind poor devil anyhow
hed never know that anything had hit
him

  he turned his attention to selwyn
who lay breathing heavily just begin-
ning to recover from the effects of the
anaesthetic

   this fellows lucky to be alive he
muttered examining the mans pupils
 hes had a pretty hefty dose how-
ever you got to him just in time well
soon have him round and hell be no
worse for his little trip into dream-
land

  paul watched with interest while the
surgeon prepared a hypodermic injec-
tion and deftly inserted it into sel-
wyns arm soon the mans pale studi-
ous face began to twitch his thin lips
to writhe and twist convulsively

  inspector dransfield after searching
baxters pockets without result was
giving instructions to the station mas-
ter and the postman paul squatted on
the floor and helped the surgeon in his
efforts to rouse selwyn

  the man was now near to conscious-
ness he was babbling the usual inco-
herent phrases which escape any one re-
covering from an anaesthetic as soon
as his eyes opened paul propped him in
a sitting position against a mail bag

   hes all right now said the sur-
geon after awhile  hell be able to
answer any questions you care to put
to him

  dransfield stepped forward and knelt
down beside the sorter gazing pity-
ingly at the pale face and trembling
lips

   youve had a rough time selwyn
he said kindly  the doctor says
youre lucky to be alive we want to
catch whoever was responsible for
doping you or we wouldnt bother you
just now can you tell us anything
about it 

  walter selwyn gazed at him stupid-
ly then his blinking eyes cleared as
recollection came back to him

   i dont know anything he said
feebly  i dont know anvthing at
all

  from the position he had taken up
outside the mans circle of vision paul
watched him intently

   we dont expect you to know
much dransfield went   but
surely you can tell us who chlo-
roformed you

   i wish i could replied selwyn
fingering his pale face which was
burned and blistered by the contact of
the chloroform  id like to see some
one suffer for this outrage but who-
ever it was caught me from behind

  his wandering gaze fell  the body
of baxter and his weak eyes opened
wide in horror

    thats baxter isnt it he gasped
 is he-is he-

  yes lies dead answered drans-
field  but dont worry yourself
about that now just tell us what you
can

  selwyn withdrew his frightened
gaze from his fellow sorter with an
effort

   the devils he muttered  i
only wish i could set you on the track
of whoevers done that but  never
saw anybody it was done too quick-
ly and silently all i know about it is
this

   i noticed nothing unusual until
after we had passed through wye-
chester we usually have a cup of tea
about that time and i broke off work
to make it

   you didnt hear any one come into
the van

   no of course the train makes
plenty of noise especially when it is
passing through the deep cuttings this
side of wyechester but one gets used
to it you know and if there had been
any sound out of the ordinary i think
i should have heard it

   i got out the teapot and stove i
had just lighted the stove when some
one seized me from behind and pressed
a stinking cloth on my face i couldnt
see and i couldnt breathe i struggled
as hard as i could but the beastly
chloroform choked me the train
seemed to be going at a hundred miles
an hour and i felt my senses leaving
me and then i knew nothing more
until i wakened up just now

   and lucky you were to waken up
exclaimed the police surgeon  an-
other few minutes with that pad on
your face would have done you in for
good

   was baxter chloroformed too
asked selwyn his water- gaze return-
ing to the figure on the floor  poor
old baxter weve worked together
on this train for-

   you neednt waste too much sym-
pathy on baxter interrupted drans-
field  when we came in we found
his handkerchief tied round your face
baxters handkerchief selwvns
eyes opened wide again  oh surely
you dont mean that lie-

   we dont know yet but it looks
most likely that it was baxter who
chloroformed you afterward robbing
the mail and being accidentally killed
death on the 



himself as he was making his get-
away

   oh ill never believe that baxter
was a good sort-a pal hed never
do a thing like that dont believe it
well well dont distress your-
self about it at present we shall know
all that happened in due course hed
no stolen packages on him so perhaps
he didnt do it dransfield rose to
his feet  i say paul would you-
he stopped short looking round the
van ip surprise for paul grendon
had disappeared

ill

it was close on midnight when the
missing detective strolled into chief
inspector dransfields private office
at scotland yard

   hello he said cheerfully
 thought id find you here ive just
called to collect those two cigars he
helped himself from the box on the
desk  thinking of going home yet
 yes ive just finished replied
dransfield take a pocketful while
youre at it you robber what the
deuce did you do that vanishing trick
for

   i wanted to get acquainted
grinned paul

 acquainted  with whom 

   the gentleman who so cleverly
robbed the mail van on the eight forty-
five old chappie

  dransfield stared  what the devil
do you mean paul are you pulling
my leg

  not at all i hope to introduce
you to him in a few days but dont
ask me any more questions now if you
love me i want to know how things
stand

  knowing his friend as he did the
inspector sighed and stifled his curios-
ity experience had taught him that
paul grendon would not divulge any-
thing about his progress in a case until
he could deliver the goods neatly par-
celed and sealed

   there are no new developments

he said  the chloroform bottle
wasnt anj help there were no finger-
prints  it the thief had been too
careful for that

  hard luck murmured paul

   i put rodgers onto the case as soon
as possible dransfield went on

 though of course the post office
have their own men for this kind of
thing we discovered that several
packages are missing from the regis-
tered mail bag the thief knew what
he was doing we cant ascertain their 
value for certain yet of course but
letters to the bank of england often
contain bank notes while those sent to
addresses in hatton garden are fre-
quently carrying diamonds

   quite so and the fact that the
thief knew what to take seems to in-
dicate that he had inside knowledge of
the contents of the registered mail
bag

  yes thats a strong point so far
as i can see the whole business is
pretty well cut and dried and i cant
imagine what sort of a track youre
following it looks pretty clear to
me that baxter was the thief other-
wise what was he doing while his pal
was being chloroformed im sure
no stranger could have entered the van
and caught selwyn unawares while
baxter had every opportunity he
knew what was in the mail bag and
helped himself to what he wanted
then he climbed on the top of the
train- by the by theyve found the
bridge that killed him

  you asked them to search for
that 

   yes i thought wed better verify
our conclusions the bridge is at seven
beeches about thirty miles this side of
wyechester part of the stonework im-
mediately above the line shows fresh
bloodstains and a few hairs

 pretty quick wrork dransfield
well there arent many bridges
over that part of the line and the
station master wakened up every one
down to wyechester so there have


detective fiction weekly

been plenty of searchers it fits in with
sehvyns story and the evidence of the
broken watch doesnt it  baxter was
killed as he was escaping he met his
punishment very soon after his crime
 what about his loot-the packages
he stole

   thats where im all at sea the
inspector tugged thoughtfully at his
heavy mustache  i suppose there
are two alternatives either he had a
confederate somewhere on the line to
whom he threw the spoil or he threw
it from the train at some particular
point where he could find it later in
the first case we may never see it
again in the second-well a thorough
search ought to bring it to light
good luck in the search paul
grendon rose and reached for his hat
there was a gleam of amusement in
his gray eyes ill be off now

   im going your way paul

   but im not going my way ive
a taxi outside to take me in the op-
posite direction

   what the deuce is your game
now  queried dransfield  why
arent you going home

   i want another interview with
him replied paul

  another interview with whom
dammit man dont talk in riddles

   the riddle is solved old chappie
im going for a talk with the clever
criminal who robbed the mail van-
and murdered ronald baxter

iv

two days went by during which
chief inspector dransfield saw
no more of his friend and in
those two days the  mystery of the
 as the papers called it grew to
worrying proportions

  it was generally accepted that
ronald baxter was the thief every-
thing seemed to point that way and
no other theory had been put forward
the mystery was-what had he done
with the stolen mail no trace of which
had been discovered

  the value of the missing packages
was too great for the matter to be
hushed up it transpired that bank
notes easily negotiable securities and
diamonds to the value of thousands of
pounds had been stolen and the press
delighting in the mystery made things
very uncomfortable for every one con-
cerned in the case

  if a man was killed two or three
minutes after committing a robbery it
should not be a very difficult matter to
recover what he had stolen in the
opinion of the press the case was an
excellent example of the well known
ineptitude of the police public in-
terest was aroused and kept at fever
heat each paper had a  special
commissioner who aired his own
views and theories unofficial treasure
hunts were organized reporters made
desperate attempts to interview poor
selwyn who was under medical care
and were only kept at bay by the ener-
getic incorruptible friend who nursed
him

  the case was not in inspector drans-
fields department which was chiefly
concerned with organization so that
the press criticisms did not affect him
personally yet he grew very un-
easy about it he had an uncomfort-
able idea due to what paul grendon
had said that perhaps his colleagues
were working on the wrong lines

  he was anxious to see paul again
and drag some sort of explanation out
of him but he could not get in touch
with his friend when he telephoned
mrs grendon informed him that her
husband was out of town and that was
all she knew about it

  he was relieved therefore on the
third day to hear pauls voice at the
other end of the wire on a trunk call

   ive been trying to get hold of you
paul he complained where the
deuce have you been

   im speaking from wyechester a
most interesting little town with many
evidences of early roman occupation
i want you to join me down here
death on the 



   im very busy what do you want
me for

  just a little fishing old chappie

   fishing look here paul-

   havent time to argue these trunk
calls cost money you know ill be
waiting for you at the white swan
wyechester incidentally therell be a
drink waiting too if youre here be-
fore seven by by old chappie dont
fail me

  the receiver slammed and there was
silence on the wire

  inspector dransfield swore vigor-
ously nevertheless he caught the first
train down to wyechester and found
his friend waiting for him in the
lounge at the white swan

   what the dickens is all this about
paul he asked irritably dropping
into a chair

   im not quite sure yet replied
paul grendon imperturbably but i
believe were going to have some fun
he beckoned to a waiter  tust time
for a drink before we go i think

  go where queried dransfield

   fishing old chappie two mar-
tinis waiter

  it was evident that he did not intend
explaining the situation and the in-
spector shrugged his shoulders in resig-
nation but he did not regret that he
had come he knew his friend well
enough to realize that there was some-
thing important in the wind

  their drinks finished they left the
hotel and strolled along the main thor-
oughfare of the quiet country town it
was now quite dark and when they
had left the shopping area behind they
found the dimly lit streets almost de-
serted

  walking more quickly now they
soon found themselves in a muddy ill
paved lane

  it was not long before they reached
a narrow river flowing silent and
mysterious under the stars where the
lane ended in a footbridge paul
turned aside and led the way through
some cultivated fields which fringed

the water until he reached a single span
bridge which carried the railway line
over the stream

   well wait here he said drawing
his bewildered companion into a black
corner under the bridge  this is not
much of a river but i believe theres
some curious fish in it dont make any
noise please i hope we shall do our
fishing by proxy

  a faint inkling of what was happen-
ing came at last to the inspector

  the stolen postal packets he
gasped theyre in the water

  if im not mistaken agreed paul
 shut up now i dont suppose our
fisherman will be long

  it was very quiet under the bridge
the two friends waited in silence
squatting on their heels against the
wall occasionally a train roared over
their heads momentarily lighting up
the deserted banks of the river

  long minutes dragged slowly past
from time to time paul glanced at the
illuminated dial of his watch they
dare not smoke lest the glow or the
smell should betray their presence
they grew stiff and cramped through
keeping their limbs in the same
position

   im sorry breathed paul when
an hour had passed  i expected him
here before this

  the vigil continued dransfields ex-
citement began to fade as time passed
without anything happening he came
to the conclusion that paul grendon
had made a mistake

  then suddenly his body tensed
he had caught sight of a figure ap-
proaching over the nearest field a
nudge from his companion warned him
that paul had seen the man too they
sat motionless watching him approach
scarcelv daring to breathe

  their eyes had grown accustomed
to the darkness and by the faint light
of the stars they could follow his
progress quite easily he advanced cau-
tiously continually glancing about him
until he reached a point on the bank


detective fiction weekly

only a few yards away from where
they sat there he stopped and
quickly undressed

  his nude body gleamed pale against
the darker background after stoop-
ing apparently to hide his clothes
under a bush he slipped soundlessly
into the river

  his movements here were not so
visible but the watchers could still
catch occasional glimpses of his head
a dark smudge on the water as he
swam about his movements seemed
to be quite aimless he swam here
and there without any obvious pur-
pose to all appearances merely enjoy-
ing the exercise

  soon however he disappeared be-
neath the surface almost a minute
passed before the watchers saw his
head again only to lose sight of it once
more

   hes caught his fish paul mur-
mured in his companions ear  hes
diving for it

  almost immediately the swimmer
appeared again making for the bank
when he climbed out they could see
that he carried a bulky parcel under
one arm

  paul nudged dransfield and sprang
to his feet

   good evening old chappie he
said stepping quickly forward queer
uniform for a postal official youre
wearing

  the swimmer stared at the two
figures that had suddenly appeared
from nowhere

   wh-who are you he stammered

   im nobody replied paul cheer-
fully  my friend here is chief in-
spector dransfield from scotland
yard

  the other man shivered there was
nothing else he could do he was
naked and defenseless he could not
even run away

   i was frightened something like
this would happen gentlemen he said
quietly  but i had to take the risk
its no use trying to bluff you im

done and i rather think im glad
youll find all the stolen mail in that
parcel may i put my clothes on

    i seem to know your voice mut-
tered dransfield  who the deuce
are you

  he flashed an electric torch and
almost cried out in surprise as the light
fell on the pale face and weak blink-
ing eyes of walter selwyn

v

  you see said paul settling him-
self in the corner of a reserved
compartment in the london ex-
press  i didnt wrant selwyn to see me
in the mail van so i stood behind him
while he told his tale and slipped out
as soon as he had finished i had got
his address from the postman and i
wanted to arrive there before him
walter selwyn sat in the opposite
corner gazing out into the night in-
spector dransfield looked at his friend
in surprise

  you suspected him so soon be
asked

   i didnt suspect-i knewr replied
paul  there was no doubt in my
mind that he was the culprit what i
didnt know was how he had disposed
of his loot

   that was why i wanted to get to
his lodgings before him and take
rooms there myself finding me there
when he arrived even though i had
only just come he was not likely to
think that i had any connection with
what had happened you never
guessed did you selwyn

  selwyn glanced round then with-
out speaking turned back to his win-
dow again

  but what was the idea paul
queried dransfield after awhile
 what line were you working on

   well i had evidence that selwyn
was lying it was obvious that the
whole business had been very carefully
planned he had planted his loot in
some safe hiding place and probably
intended to let it remain there until
death on the 



things had quietened down then quick-
ly unearth it and disappear my idea
was to bluff him into betraying his
hiding place then there would be
enough evidence to hang him

   i made friends with him by inter-
fering when the reporters came and
keeping them away from him he was
glad enough to have me sit with him
and warn them off so there i was
nursing my criminal trying to think of
some way to bluff him

   hes not the type of man who
would take any one into his confidence
so i didnt believe that he had a con-
federate wondering what i myself
should do if i had to throw a parcel
from a moving train into a place where
it would be safely hidden i could think
of nothing that would suit my purpose
so well as a river

  as i sat discussing the mystery
with him the next day i put forward
this theory as a possible way in which
baxter might have acted i could see
anxiety spring into his eyes and knew
i was on the right track so i carried
matters a stage further i told him
that according to the reporters who
were continually calling the police had
come to the same conclusion as my-
self and had commenced dragging all
canals and rivers over which the rail-
way passed after leaving wyechester

   this put the wind up him thor-
oughly-didnt it selwyn if the
police carried their activities a little
further afield they would find the loot
and all his trouble would be wasted
he decided to recover the stolen
packages at the first opportunity and
hide them somewhere else

   to-day the doctor took the band-
ages from his face and he was allowed
to go out he told me he was going
to visit a friend i shadowed him to
the station and heard him take a ticket
for wyechester i came down by car
and beat him by half an hour t noticed
that the railway crossed the river just
outside the town and felt that my job
was nearly finished

   i knew he wouldnt attempt any-
thing until after dark so there was
plenty of time to send word to you
dransfield i had an idea youd like
to be in at the death

   it was jolly decent of you paul
said the inspector you seem to
have caught us all napping but i
must confess that i dont see it yet
what about baxter he pointed
toward the silent prisoner  did he-
 yes selwyn killed him

   i didnt snapped selwyn sud-
denly turning  you caught me red-
handed with the mail and i cant deny
that but i wont have murder hung
onto me i didnt kill baxter

   selwyn killed him repeated paul
ignoring the outburst  it was part
of an exceedingly well thought out
scheme which had been brewing in his
mind for months and the essence of
this scheme was that no suspicion
should be allowed to fall on himself

   the best way of insuring this was
to throw it on some one else thats
why poor baxter had to go he was
knocked out some time before the
train passed through wyechester by
that piece of iron piping we found in
the waterproof bag correct me if i
go wrong wont you selwyn 

   its all wrong muttered the pris-
oner sullenly  i didnt kill baxter
well you can tell another story to
the jury if you like i prefer to be-
lieve this after baxter was knocked
out the packages from the registered
mail bag were placed in a waterproof
bag along with the bloodstained piping
youve seen the bag the numerous
little floats attached to it were cal-
culated to come nearly to the surface
of the water and make it easy for a
swimmer to find it without searching
all over the river bed

   the bag was dropped into the
river as the train crossed the bridge
then selwyn turned his attention to
baxter

   he laid aside the unconscious
mans handkerchief dragged him to


detective fiction weekly

the end of the car and unlocked the
door if he had simply thrown the
body onto the line suspicion - might
still rest on himself he wanted it to
appear certain that baxter had been
accidentally killed after robbing the
mail also to hide the wound made
by the iron piping

   he got the limp body onto his
shoulders and with the greatest dif-
ficulty managed to climb the rungs of
the next car took some courage to
do that dransfield when a slip meant
certain death however he got up in
time he knew the train was nearing
a bridge holding the unconscious
man under the arms he hoisted him
up with a great effort so that the stone-
work of the bridge crushcd his skull
and threw him forward onto the top
of the carriage behind

   i didnt do any such thing cried
selwyn  im not a murderer i
wouldnt have the nerve

   youve plenty of nerve selwyn
more than is good for you it took
courage to climb up that carriage it
took courage to fasten that chloro-
formed pad over your face carefully
avoiding making any finger-prints on
the bottle you must have known you
were risking death there

  a likely story isnt it sneered
selwyn  i dont know who you ex-
pect to believe it

  there was a long silence walter
selwyn sat staring out of the window
again inspector dransfield smoked
thoughtfully watching his friend

  youre sure about all this paul i
suppose he said at last

  it follows doesnt it if selwyn
robbed the mail he must have killed
baxter and that iron piping tells a
pretty definite story

   but you didnt know about that
why did you suspect him in fhe first
place 

   that handkerchief with the name
on it the only reason it was used
was to throw suspicion on baxter
baxter himself would never have been
so foolish as to use his own baxter
knowing the line as he did would never
have been careless enough to be caught
by that bridge these two points
made me suspect selwyn from the
beginning and in addition i found
definite proof that he had killed
baxter

   youre lying cried selwyn
 youre trying to bluff me again
paul drew a little paper packet from
his pocket and handed it to dransfield

    bits of his broken watch glass he
said  i think youll find theyll fit to-
gether with the pieces you have he
turned suddenly on selwyn  perhaps
youll explain how these came to be
lying on the carriage top with baxter
selwyn stared at the incriminating
fragments his face blanched and he
shivered

   i-i dont know he stammered
 i cant think-

  well ill tell you your wrist
watch was broken up there when
the impact of the bridge snatched
baxter from your grasp at eight
twenty precisely the official time for
the train to pass seven beeches the
time at which your watch stopped

   damn you snarled selwyn
jumping to his feet  youve got me
i thought every detail was perfectly
planned and youve got me but i
wont live to-

  he made a sudden dash for the
carriage door but paul grendon was
there before him

    not that way old chappie he said
quietly helping dransfield to handcuff
the struggling prisoner  what was
good enough for baxter is too good for
you youve had your fun you
mustnt try to avoid paying the price

whats called falling in love but if
ever a woman made me melt with the
sheer witchery of her it was lucille
vallandri aye and she was a devil
yon young woman a beautiful devil
she should have hung im not joking
she missed it by the skin of her teeth
ill tell you all about her-and the burn-
ing cigarette that cost the life of the
man whose mistress she was at the
time-no the facts never came out he
cheated the gallows before they even
got him the length of trial he kept
poisq ready in his wrist-watch

  as far as i was concerned went on
maclver it began one night when i
was on duty at battlekirk i had only
been in the district about a couple of
months ancl i used to wonder how
many years it would be before any-
thing happened to break the awful mo-
notony in yon out-of-the-way corner of
the borders i can mind how the rain
was pelting down that night and the
wind from the cheviots lashed round
you like a whip it seemed that every-
body else in teviotdale was in bed ex-
cept myself and just because i had
been fool enough as i thought to join
the force in preference to trudging be-
hind a plow on my fathers small hold-
ing in the merse i had to be out there
on duty-aye and shivering under a
doorway with the rain trickling down
my neck and wishing to god somebody
would break into the clydesdale bank
or commit a murder just to stir things
up a bit

  i nearly gave three cheers when i
saw a white smudge of light show up in
the distance it was a motor car coming
down from the north so i wasnt
the only body in scotland out in the
storm that night it cheered me up to
watch the light getting nearer and soon
a big car went rushing past the cross-
roads then i heard the brakes go on
and the tires grinding and grinding on
the rough surface till the car stopped

  it started to reverse it was a big
yellow limousine i could see from the
shelter of my doorway and a man was
leaning out of the driving seat he
turned the car in to the side so that
his headlights shone on the signpost
at this i stepped out of the doorway
and hurried over to hiror

   can i help you i asked i no-
ticed that he wasnt dressed like a
chauffeur but had a cloth cap pulled
down over his face

  are we near battlekirk he in-
quired and i told him he was already in
battlekirk

   is it far to milne easter he said
 three miles sir i replied  and
milne wester is five miles down this
other road i added for it struck me
that milne wester a decent-sized vil-
lage with a lot of gentlefolk living in
it was the place he really wanted to get
to milne easter being only a few poor
cottages with no houses of any size near
it at all

  but it seemed to be milne easter he
wanted right enough he thanked me
and began to turn back to the south
road again as if hed had an after-
thought he leaned out and said
how many miles is newcastle

  i	told him but i had a queer feeling
by the way he spoke that he didnt care
a rap how far newcastle was and
then i saw something that took my
breath away and left me standing on
that road as stiff as the white signpost
beside me

  in turning the nose of the car the
headlamps had blazed into the shop
window five or six yards away the
light was reflected back just as if it
had shone against a mirror the driver
was half-blinded he swore good-na-
turedly and swung the wheel quickly
round but not before i had seen into
the back of the car

  a woman sat there with dark furs
round her face and ill never forget
her expression it was one of un-
speakable horror beside her a man
lay huddled stiffly back on the cushions

 d
the body of sir henry



right up to his chin he was covered
with a traveling rug he was elderly
and had thick gray hair his skin was
chalk white and his eyes were wide
open and staring straight upward the
light didnt seem to dazzle them it
would have dazzled mine if i hadnt
had my back to it but one quick
glimpse at him was enough to tell me
the important thing the man was
dead

  in a flash the womans hand came
out from her furs and pulled the trav-
eling rug up over his face from which
it had apparently slipped down the
car swerved away from the shop win-
dow and the reflected light snapped
out

  the limousine gathered speed and
was gone i stood there with my head
buzzing round as i watched its shape
getting less and less against the glow
of its lights ahead of it and then the
little red tail-light moved around the
bend and disappeared

ii

i tell you i could have kicked my-
self right over the crossroads and

  back again i hadnt even had the
gumption to cast an eye on its number-
plate a fine fool id look when i re-
ported this to the sergeant as id have
to do-and i was to meet him in a little
less than half an hours time

  but sergeant gailes just laughed at
me

 a dead man he said you
young fellows read ower much o that
sensational trash nowadays drunk
mebbe but not dead na na maclver
im thinking ye were ower dazzled by
the lights yoursel to see very clear
na

   im sure the mans mention of
newcastle was just a pure blind i de-
clared

  sergeant gailes grunted and shook
some of the rain from the top of his
flat-peaked cap  yed better keep
your tongue between your teeth about
it he advised  that kind o thing
 d

is no likely to do ye any good wi the
inspector at teviothead yell be re-
porting that yeve seen a ghost next
laddie na na

  but i wasnt satisfied as i cycled
back toward battlekirk i kept chewing
the matter over it was just before i
got to the main road that an idea struck
me and instead of going home to bed
i turned south toward milne easter
i had suddenly remembered that about
a mile from the village was a big house
called black weir-in fact the only
house of any size round about if that
car was really making for milne east-
er black weir was probably the actual
destination then i remembered some-
thing else the house wras shut up it
belonged to an old bachelor sir henry
elliston-stewart i didnt know him
by sight but in the couple of months
id been stationed at battlekirk i had
heard plenty about him he lectured
to antiquarian societies and was sup-
posed to have a wonderful collection of
antique scottish and french jewels he
was wealthy of course and they called
him half-daft-seemingly he thought
nothing of sending all his servants
home on holiday for three months and
going away on his travels with black
weir house shut up aye and it was
shut now when i remembered this
the only thing that kept me going on
was sheer dourness the chances were
that i was on a wild-goose chase

  i got off my cycle and went for-
ward to the big iron gates they were
padlocked so that finished it

  my spirits were away down in my
boots-along with a lot of rain-water
-and turning back i started to
mount but i nearly sprawled across
my machine in surprise curving in
from the main road to the avenue were
the fresh marks of motor car tires

  it took me about two minutes to
wheel my cycle along the road hide it
in a ditch and climb over the high
stone dyke beyond the lodge the
lodge i knew was unoccupied-and
had been since the head gardener left


detective fiction weekly

-so there was no good trying to seek
information there

  the night was desperately black
rather than risk losing my way by tak-
ing the short cut through the woods i
preferred to trudge the quarter of a
mile of twisting avenue and a long
quarter of a mile it was

  black weir house when i got to
it was the most dismal-looking thing
you ever saw-a great rambling place
with turrets and crow-step gables and
not a chink of light showing anywhere
and then beside the doorway i made
out the shape of a motor car i had
been right about the ti re-marks but it
remained to be seen whether i had been
right in jumping to the conclusion that
i was on the track of trouble-trouble
i mean for other folk

   i walked round the car and went up
the steps to the front door i was
about to switch on my lantern when
my eye caught a slit of light in a win-
dow on my left the curtains had been
pulled close but not close enough by
craning out over the stone balustrade
i was able to see into the room

   a lamp stood on a table and beside
it was a leather suitcase with the lid ly-
ing back there were also two bunches
of keys one of them on a long chain

   and then i saw a detail that gave me
a jar

   i had run into the real thing at last
i had been wishing that something
would happen to break the monotony
of life well it looked like being
broken into half a hundred bits now
for a door stood open in the opposite
wall of the room with another small
but very thick door of steel behind it
i could see enough to tell me that i
was looking into an open safe

  i thought of sergeant gailes and
howr long i would take to get hold of
him hours probably that was no
good if i was going to do anything
i had to do it myself-and at once i
wasnt afraid of rough work-i was
a match for most of the brawny lads
of the borders-but i was helpless

against firearms however id have
to risk that

  then i got a brain-wave whatever
action i took they would try to get
away in the motor car-it wras their
quickest means of escape i went back
down the steps and opened up the bon-
net i knew a little about motor cars
and i shone my lantern in till i got the
top off the float-chamber and saw the
petrol running out i watched it till
the last drop had gone then i closed
the bonnet satisfied that i had scored
the first point

  as i straightened up i thought i
heard a low thudding noise it wasnt
the bough of a tree in the wind it was
too near at hand for that then i
noticed another sparkle of light this
time it was in a grating in the wall
close down to the ground somebody
i knew must be busy in the cellar a
queer occupation for anybody after
midnight flashing my lantern up i
clanged the bell

  the thudding stopped i looked over
the balustrade the light down at the
grating moved and went out then
silence i could still see the light at
the window of the room on my left but
only a glimmer for the narrow slit in
the curtain had been closed

  i waited for a matter of three or
four minutes then rang the bell again

  the front door was at once thrown
open as if somebody had been waiting
behind it in case i rang again half a
dozen candles had been lit in the big
hall and standing in the doorway was
the man who had been driving the
motor car

    good lord he said  i wondered
who the deuce it could be at this time
of night come in constable its too
damned stormy to be out of doors

ill

i was glad he had spoken first for
i wras a bit flustered and not very
sure of what line to take i decided
to go very cautiously and bide my
time
the body of sir henry



  and what can i do for you con-
stable he said lighting a brier pipe
i could see he was a man of about
fifty-five he was dark and thin but
he looked wiry and he had a frank and
extremely pleasant smile  nothing
wrong eh

   nothing  hope sir i said  im
doing what i thought was my duty
i knew sir henry had been away for
about a month and hadnt come back
so seeing the marks of a car at the
gates i thought id have a look
around

  quite right said the man at once
 glad the police arc so wide awake
didnt we pass you at the crossroads
eh 

   thats correct sir

   thought so he nodded  hadnt
you better have a drink its a foul
night and ive just been down in the
cellar opening a case of sir henrys
brandy

  which explained the thudding i had
heard but i couldnt think why his
hands looked as if they had been scrap-
ing among brown earth

   my names norgate he went on
 colonel norgate were on our way
to newcastle we should have been
here quite early in the evening but sir
henry wanted to collect some goods
and chattels-and some odd things
from his safe i told him he shouldnt
leave valuables here with the house
empty its asking for trouble-dont
you think so he hadnt even warned
the police to keep an eye- hullo
he broke off and stared at me in
amazement he must have read some
of my suspicions in my face for he
burst into loud laughter  you dont
mean to say youve been thinking
that- come in and have a drink
constable-thats worth a drink any
day

  he led me into a large room on the
left-the one i had seen through the
chink in the curtains it was lined
with books and had some big carved
furniture the safe was closed i

noticed and the door in the wall
looked like any ordinary door the
suitcase still lay on the table near the
lamp but it was shut the bunches of
keys had gone away at the other end
of the room a fire was crackling and
spluttering in a gratf as if it had only
recently had a match put to it

  on the hearthrug with her back to
the fire was the woman i bad seen in
the car her fur coat was open her
hat was off and in the lamplight she
looked wonderful she was laughing
and chatting with a man who sat in an
armchair

  and then i saw that providence had
prevented me from making a grand
fool of myself i couldnt see the
mans face for his back was to me
but i recognized his thick gray hair at
a glance he was the man i had
spotted beside her in the motor car a
half finished tumbler of spirits was on
a little table at his elbow and a long
spiral of smoke curled up from the
cigarette in his fingers

   my wife and sir henry ellison-
stewart said colonel norgate nod-
ding in their direction  it was only
the local police constable he called
out to them  ive brought him in for
a drink

  the woman looked up gave me a
smile that set my raw young heart
astir wished me good evening and
went on chatting

  colonel norgate had stepped to the
sideboard near the door and was pour-
ing me out a drink

   sir henry turned very groggy on
the way here he said in a lowered
voice  i thought wed have to stop
the night at some wayside pub and call
in a doctor however a good stiff
dose of brandy has pulled him to-
gether i dont think its anything very
serious- yes my dear

  the woman crossed the library
with an empty glass  another drink
for sir henry jim-he says hes feel-
ing all right again she turned to
me  oh constable by the wav


detective fiction weekly

would you do sir henry a favor  itll
save him writing

   certainly maam i said readily

   you see sir henry is coming
abroad with us she explained  well
be yachting and he wont be back for
three months ancpperhaps longer he
wonders if youd mind telling this to
the police sergeant or to whoever
should be told so that the house will be
looked after will that be all right
thanks most awfully for all your
trouble

  charm is a queer thing that young
woman stood talking to me by the side-
board for less than five minutes but
by the time she had finished i think i
would have done anything in the world
for her because she had merely taken
notice of me i felt a good two inches
taller and then i remembered what
i had done to their motor car and i
wondered how in heavens name i was
going to blurt out what a fool i had
been i wondered if i should clear
out and say nothing hoping that theyd
have some spare petrol on the car it
was a devilish awkward situation i
can tell you i was on the point of
broaching the subject when she turned
away with a bright laugh and a friendly
nod

  give the constable another drink
jim she said  itll keep out the
cold and wet

  while the colonel was refilling my
glass i followed her in admiration with
my eyes she sauntered back to the
hearth carrying herself superbly with
that easy swing of hers and then my
eyes fastened on one detail and for a
long second i felt as though id had a
sudden icy douche everything became
plain to me-everything the colonel
handed me my glass

    i wjonder sir i said in a steady
voice  if youd mind signing my

the

book itll keep me right with the
sergeant to-morrow

   certainly he declared taking the
pencil and notebook i held out to him
and when his hands were together i
clicked the handcuffs on his wrists

  with one leap i was at the door and
had locked it and slipped the key in
my pocket

   what the hell are you getting at
the mans face was twisted and white
as i pulled a little automatic pistol from
his hip pocket

   the murder of sir henry ellison-
stewart i said  and the attempted
robbery of his safe-with the keys you
took from his body it was a good
idea to bury him in the last place theyd
look for him-his own cellar

  the man was crouching like an
animal but he knew i had him beat
everything i said was going home on
him like successive blows

  you had to pull the wool over me
somehow i said watching him close-
ly  you had to convince me he was
still alive when you saw me there
at the front door just now you knew
id seen too much back at these cross-
roads ive no doubt you stopped the
car on that lonely bit of road on soutra
and killed him in cold blood aye
well i compliment ye both and espe-
cially the lady youre clever devils
the two of you but for one thing
aye one thing only id have left this
house without a single suspicion in my
mind-which is what yeve been play-
ing for

  i pointed toward the hearth

  with a cry the woman had run for-
ward but the gray-haired man who
sat with his back to us had not stirred
his white hand rested on the arm of
his chair the lighted cigarette burned
right down until it had charred the
flesh of the dead fingers

  that sentence contains an abrupt
transition from the ordinary to the ex-
traordinary from comedy to tragedy
but it does not exaggerate as there
would have been no murder had not
our hotel been included in the series
which i have named and now i will
link up both by relating in sequence
the events which culminated in a ghast-
ly crime

  the movie operator had first urged
that sunday afternoon should be the
chosen time for making the film but at
the request of the manager he agreed
to monday night usually our worst
from the point of view of patronage
but on this occasion rendered important
by a dinner concert by artists of re-
nown who were certain to attract a
large and fashionable crowd it was
arranged that three episodes in the
story of the hotel should be told-
lunch time afternoon tea time and din-
ner time there were to be films made
of the exterior depicting our patrons
arriving and a few interior scenes
which would have to be touched up at
the studio because the management
could permit nothing likely to interfere
with the comfort of our guests

an odd defect

  that was the simple arrangement
and when i returned to the hotel on
monday morning to resume my duties
i heard all about it from the manager
who was feeling nervous less such a
method of publicity damage our pres-
tige by making us seem cheap i did
not quite agree with him reminding
him that if all the other leading hotels
were in the scheme we could not afford
to be left out that cheered him up
and he was quite keen on it when at
half past twelve the operator and his
assistant arrived they were both
youngish men of unimportant appear-
ance and void of personality but they
evidently knew their work and i con-
gratulated them sincerely on their
smoothness and efficiency

  when the third episode was  shot

they prepared for departure it shows
how little they interested me when i
say that i never troubled to inquire
their names and i should have forgot-
ten them completely had i not been
keen to see the copy of the film which
they had promised to send the manager

  it duly came to hand in less than a
week and at first sight i thought it ex-
cellent but a closer scrutiny enabled
me to spot at least one defect-in al-
most every scene the same man and
woman appeared they were a strik-
ing couple and could not be mistaken
the tall clean-shaved man with the
large dark eyes and rather prominent
lips standing or sitting beside the petite
little lady with the wonderful teeth re-
vealed by an even more wonderful
smile

under false names

   they might be actors posing pro-
fessionally and they make it look un-
real said the manager with a growl
 the funny thing is i cant recall see-
ing either of them in the hotel can
you 

  i could not but then there was noth-
ing surprising about that i never pro-
fess to keep a mental register of our
patrons-it was as much as i could do
to keep an eye on those who interest
me professionally-but at the same
time i was surprised at the managers
failure to recall the most prominent per-
sons in the film for i am certain that
once seen they could not have been for-
gotten easily however there was
nothing more to be said on the subject
the film was apparently complete and
in a short time our hotel would be
shown on the screen in some hundreds
of theaters

  a month or so later the whole affair
had degenerated into the commonplace
one of those exciting events which
grow stale before they are a day old
and we had far more important things
to think about long before a headquar-
ters detective brought to the manager a
letter from the chief of police at nice
adventures of a house detective



france inquiring if a frenchman of
the name of decalon and a fime yi-
bert had stayed at our hotel on mon-
day june 

  it was the work of a few minutes to
run through our books and ascertain
that no one bearing either name had
been among our guests on the night in
question and the manager was telling
the detective so when the latter drew
from his pocket a couple of photo-
graphs

   they may have used false names
he said  the probability is that they
did but you may be able to recall their
appearance look at these photo-
graphs

a murder in france

  i uttered an exclamation of surprise
the instant i saw them

   why theyre the couple who fig-
ured so prominently in the film that
was taken of the hotel that very day
i cried and all three of us stared hard
at the photographs for quite a minute

  the detective was the first to break
the silence

   id like to hear about that film he
said settling himself in the armchair
facing the manager  but before you
start id better tell you that the french
police are interested because the day
before yesterday decalon the original
of that photograph was shot dead at
nice by the husband of the original of
the other photograph

  it did not take me long to satisfy his
curiosity concerning the film but when
 had finished he had to confess that he
knew little more than he had already
related about the tragedy at nice it
was apparently another instance of the
eternal triangle in this case the actors
being a young married couple in poor
circumstances and a middle-aged bach-
elor of considerable wealth apparent-
ly the latter had been the tempter and
the jealous husband unable to convince
his wife that all that glitters is not
gold had followed his treacherous rival
to nice and had shot him dead in a

corridor of one of the principal hotels
there

   it is the sort of thing thats always
happening in europe said the detec-
tive preparing to leave us

   except in one particular i re-
marked picking up the photographs
from the table and gazing at them
 according to your story decalon and
the lady eloped to new york and
stayed at this hotel under assumed
names but if they were so desirous of
secrecy why did they make themselves
so conspicuous during the taking of the
film i dont refer to the exterior
scenes in which they appear for then
they might have been filmed without
knowing it but that scene where they
are almost sitting in the ame chair in
the lounge could not have been photo-
graphed without their being fully
aware of the fact

   by jove youre right it does seem
odd said the headquarters man he
rose and stretched himself  its no
business of mine anyhow the mans
dead and its the job of the nice police
to deal with his murderer whos in
jail but ill mention what you say to
the chief in the event of further inqui-
ries being considered desirable

a vain couple

  the little problem i had propounded
kept my interest alive and the next
time i was down town i looked in at
headquarters and found the detective
who had brought us the photograph
he had half a dozen french papers in
his desk and in each one of them the
photographs of decalon and mme yi-
bert were reproduced and once again
i scrutinized faces which were by now
almost as familiar to me as my own

  there was no doubt that they had
been at our hotel on june  whatever
the manager or the reception clerk
might say to the contrary but how
could they have been there and yet pass
unobserved in spite of the mans re-
markable appearance and the womans
amazing beauty t marveled at the


detective fiction weekly

vanity of the couple in boldly posing
for the movie operator when they both
must have known that there was a
wronged husband capable of avenging
himself by committing murder

   the husband is in prison now
awaiting trial said the detective as i
handed the papers back to him  hell
be acquitted of course for they never
convict in crimes of passion in france

  he yawned lit a cigarette and hav-
ing chatted on general topics for a few
minutes we parted

an amazing meeting

  it was a lovely afternoon and i made
for city hall park where there was
quite a crowd enjoying weather perfect
for new york i was strolling along
broadway when i was startled by see-
ing in front of me the originals of the
two persons in the film of the hotel i
had less than ten seconds in which to
identify them as they passed me but in
that brief time i discovered all the
proof i needed including a tiny scar
to the extreme left of the upper lip of
the man and although they as sudden-
ly disappeared i felt as though i had
suddenly discovered that the age of
miracles had not yet passed

  it was clearly a case for action
however and i acted promptly a taxi
was at hand and i was soon at the ad-
dress in forty-second street from
which the copy of the film sent to the
manager had been addressed but all
that rewarded me was the information
given grudgingly by a surly housekeep-
er that the film company i was inqui-
ring about had rented the single room
office for only a month and then had
merely used it as an accommodation ad-
dress

  by now i had come to the conclusion
that the affair was beginning to look
serious if not sinister and i drove back
to headquarters but i was not prepared
for the good humored chaff of the de-
tective when i related what i had seen

   no he said in laughing protest
 you must be mistaken why decalon

is dead and mme yibert is at nice
under the supervision of the police who
are determined that she shant avoid
giving evidence at the trial you cant
expect me therefore to believe that
not only is mme yibert in new york
but that decalon the murdered man is
actually alive and walking about new
york

   i dont care what you say i re-
torted  i saw the originals of these
two photographs little more than half
an hour ago and its my opinion that
if youll find the man who took the
film of the hotel youll also find the
real story behind the murder at nice
isnt it odd that the so-called film com-
pany should have had what amounts
to a fake office in forty-second street 
isnt it odder still that what i may
call the principal and most prominent
actors in the film of the hotel should
be a man and a woman who to all in-
tents and purposes had the very best of
reasons for avoiding the very promi-
nence the film gives them

inside the plot

  he played nervously with the pens
on his desk and was silent

   ill have inquiries made about the
film company he said at last  per-
haps youll send along the copy of the
film and any communications you have
had from the company

   theyll be in your possession to-
night i said and i was as good as
my word for a special messenger de-
livered them at headquarters within an
hour and then the manager in whom
i had confided and i waited for the
developments which we both knew
would be sensational

  but we had to wait some weeks and
the reason was that the man and the
woman i had seen in broadway had
recognized me and had promptly sailed
for europe they were actually ar-
rested in pontorsin a village in brit-
tany a month after my visit to head-
quarters and the charge against them
was blackmail and conspiracy
adventures of a house detective



  for the film of the hotel had been
part of a blackmail plot by a gang of
four including one woman they had
rented the room in forty-second
street given themselves a high-sound-
ing name and had selected our hotel
as the scene of the film which was to be
used to extort money

  the real decalon the man who was
murdered at nice was a friend of the
yiberts who were as i have said poor
in comparison with the wealthy manu-
facturer decalon entertained them
frequently and on occasions was seen
alone in mme yiberts society but
there never was any question of in-
trigue until a mutual acquaintance by
the name of lendra concocted the
scheme which he intended should com-
pel decalon to pay hush money

  owing to his intimacy with both
parties lendra heard regularly of their
few engagements and when one eve-
ning decalon casually mentioned that
he was going to new york on business
on a certain date and the next morning
lendra ran into mme yibert who in-
formed him that she was going to
spend three weeks with an aunt at mar-
seilles he began to make his plans there
and then	

  he assembled a little company in-
cluding an out-of-work actress who in
figure and face resembled mme yibert
and who could  make up  to look like
madame to the life there was also a
big burly ruffian to impersonate de-
calon and the fourth member was an
expert movie operator who may be
described as unemployable because of
his record and character

  i need not describe in full how the
film was taken which apparently de-
picted mme yibert and m decalon
entering our hotel and chatting in-
timately in the lounge and later dining
together it was very well done and
when the picture was complete lendra
called on decalon to inform him that
he had been asked by a certain person
to offer him for sale all the rights in
a film which decalon would find it to

his advantage to suppress the wealthy
manufacturer who had returned to
france and was on eve of leaving for
a holiday at nice had first thought
that lendra was attempting a silly and
meaningless -joke and when at last it
dawned on him that the blackguard
was serious he threw him out of the
room and kicked him out of the front
door had the yiberts been at home
he would have telephoned to tell them
of the attempt to blackmail him for
he and mme yibert had nothing what-
ever to hide but the latter was still
with her aunt and yibert himself was
staying with a bachelor friend in the
country and it was to this unfor-
tunate absence from home of the
yiberts that the tragedy was due en-
tirely for if decalon could have had
a few minutes on the phone with either
of them he would have saved his life

  as it was he went off to nice and
lendra crazy for revenge sent the
copy of the film in his possession to
yibert accompanying it with specially
enlarged photographs of the scenes in
which the bogus decalon and the bogus
mme yibert figured prominently

  to yibert the evidence must have
appeared decisive-he believed that
whereas the camera cannot lie an aunt
can and will to help a niece engaged
in an intrigue-and being naturally of
a very jealous disposition he had
thought of nothing else but revenge
how he took it has been told and all
that remains of the story can soon be
related lendra was arrested shortly
after the impersonators of decalon and
mme yibert were under lock and key
but the fourth member of the gang es-
caped to south america the trio were
put on trial a week after yibert had
been acquitted as the result of an emo-
tional appeal by one of the most cele-
brated french lawyers but there was
no emotion when the three blackmail-
ers stood in the dock and in contrast to
the acquitted murderer got ten years
imprisonment each it is a way they
have in france

  the maid heard an angry cry  go away   the library door
  clicked shut-and three minutes later harry tenby lay dead

by j jefferson farjeon

away dyou hear go

 i	y away shouted harry tenby
the library door closed with
a little click three minutes later he
lay dead on the carpet

 there was no sign of struggle the
furniture was not disarranged the
standard lamplight still glowed with
amber mellowness but a little cool
breeze flowed in through the open
french window and some four feet
from the dead mans head lay a blood-
stained handkerchief

  in the distance across a night-black
fringe of foliage a church clock
chimed eleven two minutes ahead of
the church a little brass clock on the
mantelpiece ticked restlessly ticked
away the hours of twelve and one and

two informed of its impatience each
hour by the leisurely distant chimes

  three four five the night-
black fringe of foliage took on a gray
hue six birds stirred waking the
eaves and a hoarse cock announced the
day seven the library door opened
again with a little click some one
gasped

  the silent room with its grim in-
mate and its incongruous amber glow
from the standard lamp became sud-
denly alive forms flitted about voices
whispered above the dead mans form

  eight the voices grew louder
they whispered less

  nine the room lost all its privacy
it became the center of buzzing official-
dom  was pervaded with heavy signifi-


the golden idol



cance a picture of the battle of
waterloo slightly aslant on the wall
was stared at with rude suspicion and
a volume of poems by humbert wolfe
innocently leaning against wellss
 history of the world  in a book-
case became ridiculously significant

  ten eleven a dozen hours ago
the form on the ground had been alive
an inspector stared at it meditatively
then suddenly turned a newcomer
had entered the room

   ah crook the inspector ex-
claimed glad to see you weve
got a ticklish job on here

   so i gather answered crook his
eyes on the silent figure  whats
known so far  leave out theories for
the moment

  the inspector nodded

   all thats known so far he re-
plied  is-that he pointed down-
ward  the parlor maid found him
this morning at seven oclock he was
lying just as he is now lamp up-as
you see nothings been altered
crooks eyes swept the room

   no sign of a struggle he com-
mented

   no replied the inspector  it
must have been done-quick

   that handkerchief

   it was lying just there i did look
at that but its replaced

   finger-prints

   nothing to report in that line yet
   who saw him last 

  a slight frown came into the inspec-
tors eyes

   ah-i was wrong when i said
nothing else was known at the moment
it seems that mr tenbys butler saw
him last and mr tenbys butler has
disappeared

   thats interesting and when was
the butler seen last

   shortly before eleven a maid
passing on her way to bed saw him go
into the library-this room were now
in-and a few minutes later when she
was passing again-

   why did she pass a second time

if the first time she was on her way to
bed interposed crook

   she says she forgot something a
book she reads before going to sleep
ive checked that

 well goon

   the second time she heard voices
raised mr tenby seemed angry she
heard him shouting  go away do you
hear go away

  crook considered the words

   is that all she heard  he asked

   all i can get out of her answered
the inspector  shes a bit hysterical
 so-coming now to theories-the
superficial schoolboy theory wrould be
tenby quarrels with his butler over
some matter unknown the butler kills
him and runs away by the way has
the butlers bed been slept in

  the inspector shook his head
  youre searching for him

   obviously

   whats the doctors report  how
long has mr tenby been dead

   he was alive at eleven oclock last
night-that we know the medical
evidence suggests that life was extinct
before twelve wound inflicted by
some sharp instrument and no sign
of the sharp instrument

   anything stolen - as far as you
know 

   nothing

   papers reveal anything letters
   not so far

   heard anything that might ac-
count for the tragedy-apart from the
assumed quarrel with the butler

   blank again nothing

   then why do you call this case a
ticklish one inquired the detective
 youve got some nice superficial evi-
dence on which to search for a butler
havent you

   well of course were searching
for that butler retorted the inspector
what do yon think but-come
here-to the window

  they walked to the window and the
inspector pointed to some impressions
in the earth outside


detective fiction weekly

   big foot that he said  the
butler takes size seven theres not a
boot in the establishment that will fill
those impressions and theyre newly
made too

   good grunted crook his eyes
lighting  thats important i rather
thought you had something up your
sleeve inspector

   i wish i had the boot that fits those
impressions up my sleeve returned
the inspector smiling sourly  weve
got a double trail here and im blessed
if i know what to make of em

ii

crook bent down and examined
the footprints carefully then he
searched the adjacent grass while
the inspector stood by watching

    cant find any more said the in-
spector  the grounds pretty hard
and weve only got these because some
of mr tenbys special flowers happen
to be growing there the servants
had orders to water these every eve-
ning and thats what made the earth
soft

   i suppose observed crook as he
straightened himself  you dont hap-
pen to have that boot that isnt up your
sleeve on your foot 

  the inspector grinned

   oh my boots fit there right
enough he confessed  ive a useful
toe as you see he advanced his big
boot unashamedly  only if you
want to pursue that line sir ill have no
difficulty in producing my alibi

   well-just for the sake of argu-
ment-lets have it

   right between ten and one oclock
last night i was trying-unsuccessful-
ly-to trace one jim smith whos been
terrorizing downthorpe three miles
from here

   burglar 

   thats right well get him pres-
ently

   but you didnt get him last night-
ui downthorpe

   didnt see his shadow

  do you think you might have
found him if youd searched-here
the inspector whistled he stared at
crook then at the earth

  by jove thats an idea he ex-
claimed

   but does it account for the van-
ished butler

it might lets see if we can fit
the pieces smith comes here and-
he paused abruptly a constable
was approaching rather breathlessly
across the lawn

   weve found davis sir he re-
ported with big eyes

   no have you cried the inspector
and turned quickly to crook  thats
the butler-davis he swung back
to the constable   well get  with
it where is he

   in the pond answered the con-
stable

  the inspector gave an exclamation
and looked at his companion

  pond eh he muttered that
makes another piece to fit in eh well
-come along

   how far is the pond from here
asked crook

   dont know theres more than
one which pond is it he inquired of
the constable

   arf a mile off replied the police-
man  through them woods theyre
bringin im out now

  the inspector made a movement but
crook interposed

   better leave some one to watch the
library he suggested

  the constable heard the remark and
inwardly groaned he wasnt too keen
on the library hed really rather have
been a cinema actor than a constable
it was much more interesting watching
a corpse fished out of a pond still
duty was duty and for half an hour he
waited in the library while his superiors
enjoyed better sport

  davis the butler was as dead as his
master the doctor who declared sub-
sequently that lie had never had such a
busy morning pronounced the opinion
the golden idol



that the butler had been dead almost
as long as mr tenby

   drowned obviously he said
 but whether by his own hand or an-
others-well i leave that for you to
determine gentlemen

   looks to me like suicide confided
the inspector to crook  kills his
master and then saves the hangman a
job

  why should he kill his master
asked crook as they walked back to
the house  we want a motive

   we know they quarreled

   do we  i dont think so a sharp
order isnt necessarily a quarrel sup-
pose- he paused and revolved an
idea that had come into his mind
what queried the inspector

   i must interview that housemaid-
thats what responded crook  send
for her wrill you

  they reached the house and while
waiting for the maid crook made a
further examination of the library the
constable watched him and suddenly
jumped

   what have you moved the hand-
kerchief for demanded crook and
his voice sounded like a pistol shot

   i just took it up sir- began the
constable

   then just put it down again
snapped crook  surely you know bet-
ter than to move things before youre
given permission

  the constable colored grew more
convinced than ever that he ought to
have taken up film acting lifted the
gruesome handkerchief from the table
on which he had placed it and dropped
it on the floor

   was it as near the body as that 
inquired crook frowning

   a bit farther off sir i think said
the constable  more there like
yes-thats better i remember
it was there by the pattern on the car-
pet crooks voice had lost its anger
you cannot concentrate while you are
indignant and crook was cncentrat-
ing now on the handkerchief  now

how did it get in that exact position
he murmured  its beyond the dead
mans reach though-of course-he
may have dropped it

   floated down like suggested the
constable poetically trying to reinstate
himself

   perhaps and yet do you notice
constable that if the handkerchief had
floated down like-from the position
of the body it would probably have
floated down on the other side the
attack assumedly came from the
window everything points to that
the handkerchief is one of mr
tenbys you cannot fight with a
handkerchief it either lay by his
side when the attack came-but then
why should he take it up-or was in
his hand at the moment and so became
involved perhaps he was about to
blow his nose then-a few seconds
later-it was used to try and stanch a
wound y es-but mr tenbys wound
much have been beyond stanching

  he paused then turned sharpiy
the housemaid was standing before
him

ill

he scrutinized her keenly for a
second or two placed her in a
category then asked

   you are the maid who heard
daviss voice in this room last night
 no i didnt hear daviss voice
sir answered the maid tremulously
 i never said i heard his voice
crook nodded approvingly the
maid wras calm now despite her
nervousness and the fact that he had
not tripped her up in this little detail
impressed him with her usefulness as a
witness

   how are you sure then that davis
wras in this room

   id seen him go in

   he might have come out again
without you knowing it

   yes sir he might but i wasnt
gone long before i came by again my-
self i think he was still there


detective fiction weekly

   please repeat what you heard

   it was mr tenbys voice  go
away he said  do you hear  go
away  she paused  he spoke
sharp-thats why i heard

   did he seem in a rage

   no i wouldnt say that

  very angry then

   a bit angry yes sir irritated as
you might say

   they werent actually quarreling
then

   no sir

  now listen this is important
is there no other word-even one
single word-that you can remember
having heard

  the maid flushed a little

   yes sir she said  i was that
upset that i couldnt think of it when
the inspector asked me but ive been
thinking it all over and i do remem-
ber the words  look after myself he
said them just before the others  look
after myself 

  crooks eyes brightened he leaned
forward and exclaimed  this is im-
portant were the words in the form
of a statement or a question

  the maid did not seem to under-
stand  listen he said and repeated
the three words   look after myself
thats a statement  look after my-
self  thats a question which was
it more like

   it was a question answered the
maid

   thank you replied crook
 thats all for the moment you can

g-

  he also dismissed the constable and
ten minutes later the inspector came
upon him in a brown study

  getting anywhere asked the in-
spector if youre not-i am

   where are you getting inquired
crook

   ive got jim smith said the in-
spector  just been on the phone
they took him half an hoir ago and
its pretty clear you were right and
he was around here last night theyve

looked at his boots size eleven same
as those prints outside the french win-
dow-and same as mine

   then davis may have been warn-
ing his master mused crook and the
inspector looked at him sharply
whats that he exclaimed

   ive just got a little more out of
that housemaid than you did the de-
tective explained  she heard three
more words than she told you mr
tenby said-assumedlv to davis be-
fore dismissing him  look after my-
self was he a headstrong man do
you know plenty of pride

  thats it youre right cried
the inspector  davis heard noises
or rumors and interviews mr ten-
by before going to bed  jim smiths
about he says to mr tenby
thought id better tell you sir
tenby is busy a bit nervy we all
are at times  think i dont know
how to look after myself he cries
davis is about to press his point when
tenby rounds on him go away
dyou hear go away the in-
spector chuckled delightedly  hows
that for our lost pieces eh

   theres a bit more of the picture
to fill in replied crook  what
happened then davis not satisfied
went into the grounds smith creeps
up to the window enters kills mr
tenby davis comes upon him
theres a chase-and davis ends his
life in the pond pushed in by smith
eh

   that would be about it nodded
the inspector

   well if thats it said crook
 youll have to find bloodstains on
smith somewhere or other i should
imagine and youll have to prove him
the sort of man who would commit two
murders in a single night and youll
have to search for the doctors sharp
instrument a sandbag seems to me
more in smiths line

  yes but-confound it- began
the inspector  well then what do
you think
the golden idol



    i think youve nearly got the
 story but not quite replied crook

    what is the story demanded the
 inspector

    i dont know yet admitted
 crook  but ive a notion that hand-
 kerchief on the ground there may tell
 - me do you mind if i take it away

   not at all but what are you
 going to do with it 

   crook smiled

iv

 detective crook had been
 summoned from hampstead that
 morning now he returned with
 the bloodstained handkerchief care-
 fully preserved in his pocket and
 locked himself in a large and not too
 appetizing room

    the room bristled with bottles con-
 taining queer fluids with microscopes
 and magnifying glasses with instru-
 ments reflectors tubes and powders

   the handkerchief was brought out
 the instruments the magnifying
 glasses and the fluids got to work
 when in due course it had told all it
 could tell to the ruthlessly inquiring
 mind that ransacked its secrets crook
 traveled back to its former home

    he went straight to the library and
 found the inspector there

    you havent hanged jim smith
 yet have you he asked almost
 facetiously

    no not yet responded the in-
 spector  who shall i hang in his
 place

    some one with a darker skin for
 choice suggested crook

    thatd be hard answered the in-
 spector  smith used to be a miner
 and the coals still in him but
 though he spoke lightly he was look-
 ing at crook rather hard

    coal washes off said crook
  try some one whose dark skin wont
 wash off say-an indian

    look here what are you driv-
 ing at demanded the inspector

     im driving at an indian some of

his blood was on that handkerchief
weve got to fit that into our picture
havent wre

   how do you know its an indians
blood 

   i know because ive tested it and
analyzed it did you think all blood
was the same inspector it differs in
every country yours and mine might
be hard to tell apart but if yours or
mine were on one end of a handker-
chief and the spanish ambassadors on
the other end it would be easy to say
which belonged to which

   howd you do that

   by examining its composition
there are two qualities in blood that
vary in proportion according to
nationality or locality call one a
and the other b mr tenbys blood
contained forty-three per cent of a and
seven of b i found some of his blood
on the handkerchief but somebody
elses blood was also on the handker-
chief with only eighteen per cent of a
and as much as forty-one per cent of
b that points to india-indisput-
ably

   does anything else point to india
though demanded the inspector

   well have to put that question i
think to jim smith answered the de-
tective  but first-cant you help
me at all

  almost as the question was asked
the inspector gave an exclamation

   wait a bit-ive thought of some-
thing  he cried  an indian why
--it was from an indians house that
smith made his last haul in down-
thorpe does that fit into it any-
where

   it will be an amazing coincidence
if it doesnt fit into it somewhere
responded crook and there was si-
lence for a few moments then he
asked what did smith take from the
indians house did you get any defi-
nite report about that

   oh yes weve got a list money
trinkets odds and ends ornaments a
little gold idol-


detective fiction weekly

   you neednt travel beyond the
idol interrupted crook his eyes nar-
rowing weve got to it now-or
to the general idea of it its just a
question of fitting in small details sup-
pose smith stole unwittingly an idol
that was particularly valued by this in-
dian suppose the indian burning
with a hatred that only an oriental
mind could understand tracked smith
and followed him and effected a meet-
ing at last-in this very room sup-
pose-

   wait a minute interposed the in-
spector  its tenbys been murdered
not smith-

   i know that the best-laid schemes
of mice and indians go astray listen
the butler warns tenby about smith
hes got hold of some rumor when
tenby hears smith outside he slips
into some dark corner for a moment
in comes smith almost before he
knows it in slips our indian after him
knife raised seeing this tenby
rushes out in the scramble smith
escapes and tenby gets the knife-but
not before he has managed to do some
damage to the indian too there was
the indians blood on the handkerchief
you remember

   what about the butler  asked the
inspector

   im coming to him smith gets
away he may not even have seen the
indian-its conceivable as soon as
he saw tenby he turned and fled the
butler going into the grounds to
satisfy himself gets there too late to
see smith but he sees the indian flying
out theres a chase it ends at the
pond and the poor butler gets the
wrorst of it

   by god muttered the inspector
if thats so-mr hoodi singh will
have something to answer for

   lets go to downthorpe and hear
his answer suggested crook

  they wtent to downthorpe mr
singh received them courteously with
oriental caution he listened to their
story gravely inscrutably his eyes ap-

pearing unnaturally bright in their en-
vironment of dark skin he
volunteered nothing until every detail
had been given to him then he smiled

   and so  have killed mr tenbv
and his butler he observed

  we have made no accusation said
crook

   oh no and you will not i
think if my blood was on the hand-
kerchief there will be some wound
from which the blood has flowed he
held up his hands calmly  examine
me my skin is whole there is no
mark upon it he smiled again
 and last night as three very dull
people will testify i tried to learn youf
english game of bridge while mr
tenby was dying-i was not much
happier

   the coincidence is odd you will
admit suggested crook

   who speaks of a coincidence re-
plied mr singh  there is no such
thing fate decides if that gold
idol had belonged to me the man who
had taken it might have died at my
hands yes him he added contem-
platively  and not another through
foolish blundering

   do you know whom the idol did
belong to  inquired crook suddenly

   oh yes returned mr singh  it
belonged to my servant the man who
let you in did you not notice his
bound wrist

   oh-so thats it is it cried the
inspector jumping up  then well
have to see your servant

   i will ring for him answered mr
hoodi singh he pressed a bell
 but i fear he may not come you
will not blame me i hope if he has had
some start 

  hoodi singhs servant did not conic
science had throwrn its searchlight upon
him for an instant but it could not
catch him he disappeared into the
void and so when jim smiths haul
was eventually unearthed did a little

a murder classic

                 a true story

by louise rice

wherever
spec ialists in
crime discuss
murders they are sure
to mention the rup-
recht case this was
one of the first un-
solved murder mys-
teries to become cel-
ebrated and the reason
was that it was one of
the first to be carefully
investigated at the time of the occur-
rence

  the victim of the crime was chris-
topher ruprecht his trade was that
of a goldsmith but his real business
was lending money at usurious rates
not illegal at the time but none the less
iniquitous

  his death came at the end of a sin-
gularly harsh life and caused few
tears yet he lingers on a tantalizing
figure in the annals of crime

  ruprecht was an uneducated man
in  that was more of a rarity than
it had been for many hundreds of
years education was seeping down
and up catching the lower and the
higher levels of society it was re-
marked that ruprecht kept all his nu-
merous accounts  in his head being
unable to read or write a word and
quite unable to figure

   d

the assassin waited with the
weapon poised

    when he had any paper connected
  with his business affairs he called in
  some one who could be trusted and
  had it read to him

     notwithstanding he was a man who
   held quite a place in the small town in
   germany where he had lived all of
   his life wrhile he kept a slovenly
   house with only one manservant to
   attend it and him his daughter was
   married to quite a fine gentleman who
   had carriages servants and a preten-
   tious house one in fact which was
   maintained in a style somewhat be-
   yond his means he was something of
   a fop was beiringer very much the
   gentleman and inclined to shift the
   blame of his extravagance on his wife
   -at least when he was talking to his
   father-in-law from whom he was al-
   ways seeking some pecuniary assist-
   ance which he seldom got

 

ruprecht the usurer
meets his last debtor

detective fiction weekly

  ruprecht was really not meanly
born but as a boy he had repeatedly
run away from school and had early
in life shown such a shrewd ability to
add thaler to thaler that his family had
soon abandoned the effort to force him
through school

   he had learned his trade as a gold-
smith easily enough after a short ap-
prenticeship and as soon as he had
begun to make money had started out
to be a loan broker the woman whom
he married brought him a house and
soon died people said that her hus-
band had starved her to death

an evil placc

  his daughter however grew up
more or less attached to him and this
attachment became greater as she grew
older she married against the advice
of her father but this did not break
the tie between them at any moment
when something worried or fretted
him he was apt to send his servant
posthaste for his daughter this was
a fact which was to bear weight later

  she was a woman with something
of her fathers harshness in her and
with a tongue of her own as is shown
by the fact that she once passed forty-
eight hours in the town lockup put
there by the complaints of neighbors
who insisted that she managed her
household and her husband in such a
loud voice she disturbed their peace

   it is worth noting that her husband
allowed her to stay  in durance vile 
until her father went and took her
out which does not argue much of
husbandly love and it is worth noting
too that she was like her father a
shrewd one in business and that
beiringer was a poor one she had
more money from her investments of
money given her by her father than
her husband had through his business

  in modern times men have become
used to women being financially inde-
pendent but in germany at that time
beiringer often showed tliat he
thought it a disgrace that he did not

have all of his wifes money to handle
for himself her father in making her
marriage contract had seen to that

  ruprecht for all that he had his
own house and for all that he was a
man of substance chose very ordinary
society he frequented alehouses of
the lowest sort instead of the com-
fortable and cleanly places where the
better classes went and was well
known for his rages at  the gentry
his son-in-law was one of the gentry
and ever since his acquisition of that
relation by marriage ruprecht had
flouted his association with the com-
monest of the town

  on february   ruprecht af-
ter a day spent in conducting business
at his house which was also his place
of business and after the tneager meal
which his servant gave him wrent to
an alehouse where he was very well
known

   it was up a dark narrow lane bor-
dered by mean houses and bits of a
very thick hedge and was at the very
end where it blocked the lane either
because of its gloomy situation or be-
cause of the reputation which it bore
the place was known as  hell

the last round

  about eight oclock ruprecht was
in the upstairs lounging room of this
alehouse and a number of men who
knew him very well made room for
him before the fire his grumbling
peevish and irritated talking was well
understood there and the man was
liked

  he had been going to that place for
several years but it was not the only
place which he ever visited and no one
knew that he was going to hell that
night

  time passed and more beer had
been taken upstairs by one of the
maids at a quarter past ten the land-
lord came into the room as was his
custom at eleven the place would
close and it was to be sure that beer
and other refreshments were at hand
a murder classic



for the last three-quarters of an hour
that he always visited the lounging
room at exactly that time the maids
had gone to bed

  there can be no question of the time
the landlord had been doing that very
thing for years

  the men in the room gave him or-
ders and he went downstairs with a
large pitcher in his hand it took him
only ve minutes at the most to fill
the pitcher and to take some cheese
from the pantry he was going right
up the stairs again and had put his
foot on the first step when a mans
voice came from the front door which
was partially opened

the ax man

   is ruprecht upstairs

  the landlord had a dim light in the
hall and the man stood in the shadow
of the door however he did not try
to see who it was he was used as
every alehouse owner was to having
all sorts of people dog the footsteps of
ruprecht trying to get loans of money
from him so he said yes ruprecht
was upstairs and the caller said
quietly

   ask him to step downstairs a min-
ute will you

  the landlord said he would

  ruprecht took the message without
surprise people were always hanging
about places where he was to be found
he set down his mug and went out
the landlord had filled only a couple
of mugs when there was a sound be-
low stai which made that stolid man
stop pouring and stare

   in gods name he exclaimed
 what was that

  as he spoke there was the sound of
a heavy fall and all who were in the
room ran out

  it was only a second that it took the
foremost to reach the front door
where a figure lay partly in and partly
out of it

  it was ruprecht bleeding profusely
from a cut in his head still breathing

  the leather cap which he had been
wearing lay inside the doorway-prov-
ing that he had fallen inward-and it
was cut almost in two

  they lifted him up and tried to get
the blood out of his eyes while they
asked him who had dealt him such a
blow but he could only moan sev-
eral ran out rushed up and down the
lane but saw  no living creature

  after a moment ruprecht spoke

   the villain-the villain with the
ax

  they told this to the men who had
searched the lane and those men at
once went out to search the houses
where people were now hanging out of
the windows asking what had hap-
pened

  the landlords wife had hastily
warmed a bed and half carrying and
half dragging they got the old man
up the stairs

  on the way up he said only one co-
herent thing

   my daughter-my daughter-

  every one knew his custom of call-
ing for his daughter whenever any-
thing happened to ruffle the old man
and so they thought this quite natural
and at once sent a runner to the other
part of town to tell her they also sent
for a physician

the doctors disagree

  the wound on ruprechts head was
four inches long and was a clean sharp
cut along the whole length of the skull
seeming to be deeper at the back than
at the front

  the physicians gave it as their opin-
ions that the blow had been struck
from behind and above this was like-
ly in that there was a stone seat against
the house and beside the front door
where a person might stand in the
shadow and not be noticed by a per-
son who looked out unsuspecting

  that it was surmised was exactly
what ruprecht had done the assas-
sin standing pressed against the house
with the weapon poised could at once

strike down with terrific force that
would fairly split the head in two the
reason that it had not split ruprechts
was that the tough leather cap had
taken a little of the force otherwise
the man must have dropped dead

  the medical men were most posi-
tively of the opinion that the weapon
used was not an ax despite the words
of the wounded man they pointed
out that no ax would give a wound of
a little over four inches like the one
that the man had received and that
the ax always curving slightly upward
at both ends would give a wound
which would be deeper in the middle
than at the ends and that only a
weapon with a long blade could have
cut as that one had it was a sword
they thought and that in the hands of
an experienced person

all for business

  the most diligent search by the town
authorities made within half an hour
of the tiifie of the crime brought for-
ward no record of a man having been
seen wearing or carrying a sword-
and it must be remembered that this is
a weapon hard to conceal even under a
cloak and no man wearing a cloak
had been observed nor any stranger
in small german towns at that period
it would have been almost impossible
for a stranger to escape observation

  the daughter came hastily but her
father did not know her she was
evidently in a stew over his keys and
hunted through his clothes until she
found them ruprechts lawyer and
man of business had arrived at about
the same time and the two of them put
their heads together making arrange-
ments for the carrying on of many bits
of business which they knew to be in
hand

  the servant was then sent for in
order to give them such details as he
knew and after assuring the doctors
that the injured man must be removed
to his own house as soon as possible
and that they would have it in readi-

ness for him the daughter and the law-
yer departed the alehouse com-
panions of ruprecht who had with
him sneered at  gentry had a good
deal to say about this stating that it
was a most unloving action on the part
of the daughter-this interest in keep-
ing up the business of her father in-
stead of grieving more over his hurt

  it was not to be denied that the
 daughter had a good deal of her father
 in her and that she saw to it that a
 command of his business was at once
 placed in the hands of the lawyer so
 no whit of interest should be lost or
 financial engagements voided on the
 other hand it was not to be denied
 either that she did exactly what would
 have pleased her father

  the early hours of the morning saw
 the wounded man partially conscious
 and with the physicians standing by
 three members of the town constabu-
 lary were admitted to him the fol-
 lowing dialogue took place ruprecht
 being able to answer only in monosyl-
 lables and with the greatest difficulty

   what was his motive

   ruprecht at that point gasped and
 turned a peculiar color and the phy-
 sicians permitted only one more ques-
 tion

   what is this schmidt

   woodcutter

   the interrogation stopped there but
 was renewed at noon when practically
 the same replies were received save
 that they were more vague and that
a murder classic



ruprecht remained silent when  what
was the motive was put to him

  the question was what schmidt was
it that ruprecht had thus identified

  the name of schmidt is as common
in germany as its english version of
smith is among us the police con-
sidered carefully there were three
men by the name in the town

  two of them who were brothers
lived in the street called the  most 
and also called the walsh it was
ascertained that one of these brothers
had been in prison in his youth charged
with being a member of a gang of
thieves the other brother who went
by the name of big schmidt was an
old acquaintance of ruprechts but had
had a quarrel with him over some
damages which he claimed which had
occasioned a suit at law the other
schmidt who was called little
schmidt knew ruprecht but although
he had had no quarrel with him was
not very friendly to him either

suspicions finger

  ruprecht in a lucid moment was
asked which one of these men he meant
to accuse but although he tried to
speak he could not do so so all three
were brought into the room where the
now dying man lay in the hope that
he might make it clear which one of
them had killed him but he was so far
gone that when he tried to lift his eyes
he lost consciousness that test failed

  the two brothers spoke to the
wounded man by name and said that
they wrere sorry to see him so ill the
other schmidt seemed restless and ill
at ease first he said that he knew
the man in the bed and then he said
that he did not and then he said
that he thought it was  the man ru-
precht

  his manner was so peculiar that the
authorities who were trying to use
psychology although they did not
know it decided to interrogate him
carefully and in such a way as to ease
his apprehensions

  his replies confounded them

  first he said that on the night of
the attack he remained with his mother-
in-law at her house until eleven and
then he said that he went home and
went to bed at nine he protested his
entire innocence of the whole matter
but he was so agitated that the ex-
amining judge decided to hold him for
further interrogation

  the following day ruprecht died
without regaining consciousness

  the man christopher schmidt was
more and more under suspicion there
were spots on the handle of his ax
and on interrogation he produced a
mass of inconsistent and contradictory
statements which made the examining
judge hold his head and ask the pris-
oner to try please to make them a little
more comprehensible but this did lit-
tle good schmidt stated that he had
gone home at eleven at nine at ten
that his wife had gone home with him
that she had stayed with the mother-
in-law that she had gone home before
him every time that he made a state-
ment about the night of the murder he
told a totally different story

  however his friends and neighbors
insisted that this was the way he al-
ways talked and that it was never pos-
sible to believe a single word he said
not because he intended to tell lies but
because it was never possible for him
to remember the events of one hour
from another

a time limit

  his mother-in-law stated that the
couple were accustomed to pass their
evenings with her so as to save light
and fuel and that on the night in ques-
tion schmidt and his wife and his
child had all gone home together but
that the wife after putting the two to
bed had returned to her mothers house
for an hour this was confirmed by
the landlady of the house where
schmidt had his poor lodgings

  the blow had been given between
twenty minutes after ten and half past


detective fiction weekly

past ten there was not the least doubt
about this narrow limit of time

   it was finally established by the peo-
ple in schmidts house and by neigh-
bors who saw him his wife and his
child going home together that
schmidt entered his house with them
at half past nine the landlady heard
him get into bed and heard his wife
leave the house heard his wife return
shortly before eleven for the town
clock struck just afterward

new evidence

  the  hell  alehouse was at the
other end of town say about a dozen
modern city blocks away when
schmidt really understood that he was
suspected of having killed ruprecht
he got his wits together and earnestly
represented to the examining magis-
trate that it would have been impos-
sible for him to rise dress again go
to the other end of town get back un-
dress and get into bed by the time that
his wife returned that he really was
in bed when she returned was estab-
lished by the fact that his landlady
passed through the hall as the door was
open into the schmidt rooms and saw
him there

  the hatchet with which schmidt did
his daily labor in the back yards of the
town was examined there were some
odd stains on it which schmidt said
were caused by his having had an in-
fected thumb which he had not tied
up and which had been oozing pus for
several days there were no chemists
at that time who could establish
whether this were the truth or not but
the physicians tried very hard to settle
the question and came to the conclusion
that schmidt was telling the truth as
for his thumb being infected there was
no doubt of that

  the two other schmidts had a couple
of the unbreakable alibis that the in-
vestigators were to encounter all along
the line they had had a disagreement
with ruprecht or rather they had
been witnesses in a suit which had been

brought against him but they had
helped rather than harmed his cause
another schmidt was found on the
outskirts of the town and here we
meet writh the shadow of a clew this
man had done woodcutting for beirin-
ger and he had been seen at the beirin-
ger house several days before he
stated that it was for the purpose of
asking for work and beiringer al-
though he did not know that the man
had been interrogated confirmed this
this schmidt also had an alibi given
by a number of people

  the authorities now turned their at-
tention to beiringer and his wife and
through the statements of ruprechts
manservant and the statements of the
landlord of the alehouse they found
something which looked very peculiar
indeed something which the dead
mans lawyer was obliged to confirm
this was that ruprecht had set the fol-
lowing day for the making of a new
will in which while he left his entire
fortune to his daughter he tied it up
so that her husband could never get
control of one thaler

the authorities wonder

  unless this will were made the
daughter would lose control of all that
her father would leave her it passing
according to the marriage laws of that
time into the exclusive possession of
her husband there wtas an agreeable
delusion those days that no gentleman
would use such money save for the
comfort and happiness of his wrife

  with the new will made in which
the daughter would be secure in her
individual rights to the quite consider-
able fortune of her father beiringer
would be left entirely out in the cold

  the daughter declared that she had
not told her husband of her fathers
intention although he had talked the
matter over with her beiringer in-
formed of the suspicions showed
astonishment and indignation the
servant stated that he had told no one
of what he knew the lawyer a close
a murder classic



careful and cautious man just the sort
that ruprecht would have chosen to be
his man of business indignantly de-
nied that he had ever said a word of
any affair which concerned a client of
his

  the authorities thought that the
daughter had shown a lack of affection
in taking her fathers keys and that
she had been somewhat cold in looking
after his comfort after he was removed
to his own house they thought that
she and her husband seemed to have
been very much reconciled from their
slightly aloof attitude of a few months
before and they thought that beiringer
seemed rather defiant

a sound alibi

  it looked like a good case-until the
man sent running from the alehouse to
the beiringer home reported beiringer
as having just come in from a neigh-
boring alehouse at that time which was
about eleven investigations proved
that beiringer had been in the parlor
of such a place a most respectable
house of entertainment called  the
golden fish from half past nine to
within a few minutes of eleven when
he had started out for his near-by
home so there was another unbreak-
able alibi

  the servant of ruprecht was im-
plored to think had anybody called
during the day preceding his masters
death with whom there had been an
argument the servant did as re-
quested and came up from the depths
of his mind with the statement that
three men whom he knew to be oboe
players in the military band of the
town had had some kind of an argu-
ment with his master

  it was easy to verify this and the
three men were taken in for question-
ing

  their story was that proschl with
two friends muhl and spitzbart had
called on ruprecht asking for an ex-
tension of the loan of twenty-two
florins which was due that day there

had been a good deal of talk after
which ruprecht had promised to wait
another day again the authorities
concluded that they had a good clew
again they were doomed to disapoint-
ment all three of the men during
the entire evening and until after
eleven were among crowds of people
playing for a dance

  a fantastic theory which was enter-
tained by a few people at the time and
at which the modern investigator can-
not but look with interest is that
ruprecht was killed by his daughter
and that in the shock of seeing a
weapon descending his first impression
was that a man with an ax was upon
him but that as he was dragged up
the stairs he really remembered the
glimpse he had caught of the figure and
that it was a groan of horror which
escaped him

the one suspect

 my daughter my daughter

  his accusation of  schmidt  might
have been the effort of the poor be-
numbed brain with its last conscious
thought to protect the very hand which
had struck him down the one hand
beloved in all the world this would
explain the choice of the name as hard
to fix on an individual as smith the
identification as  woodcutter  would
also fit several of them and increase
the general doubt in this light the
inability of the dying man to look up
when accused men were brought before
him becomes the last exertion of an
iron will to protect a brutal and im-
pious child

  ruprechts daughter was the one
person whose time could not be entirely
accounted for during the time that the
crime might have been committed to
be sure she was at home when the man
brought the information to her that
her father had been attacked but she
was notoriously a hardy woman swift
of action if she had struck at twenty-
two minutes after ten and instantly
had fled she might well have reached


detective fiction weekly

her home before either her husband or
the announcer of the disaster reached
there

  it is in the imputation of the motive
that this theory is weak it does not
seem that a woman even granted that
she is far more hardened than she ap-
pears would try such a brutal attack
on her own father when what he pro-
posed to do the following day was
really for her benefit and would have
left her in an exceedingly independent
position

  there was a sword in the home of
the beiringers too late it was ex-
amined it was clean of course
either because it had not been used for
many years or because it had been
carefully wiped there was no way
then of telling which that might be

  there is one other possibility of
course and that is that beiringer hired
some one from a distance to slip into
the town at twilight to follow rup-

recht from his home to whatever place
he might enter and to do the deed-
some one with an experienced sword
arm the difficulty in the face of this
is that the town was reached by a stage
coach and that every one arriving that
day and for days before was accounted
for-known to the drivers of the
coaches

  the ruprecht crime was committed
more than one hundred and ten years
ago but it is still counted as one of the
high lights of murder history and there
is hardly a writer on murder hardly a
student of criminology who has not
studied it it was one of the first mys-
terious murders to be really carefully
studied on the spot with as much of
scientific thoroughness as could be used
at the time and with the knowledge of
the time

  the beiringers or rather herr
beiringer succeeded to the old mans
money

    here is the solution of the problem
  presented to captain curdy last week
  compare it with your own written solu-
  tion

weems could hardly collect him-
self on his next visit he kept
staring in admiration at cap-
tain curdy

   our chemists have the evidence
you said would be necessary but how
did you ever guess

   you might have too smiled the
captain  except that it was so simple
when you were outlining your theories
you recognized that closed windows
would have caused the death but ap-
parently overlooked the simple explan-
ation that the windows might easily
have been covered over on the outside

   mentioning the empty adhesive
spindles and the large drawing paper
that littered gordons room supplied
the rest while gordon was sketching
on the roof he was considering in what
manner he could do away with
schwartz so that he could continue to
live upon mrs schwartzs bounty he
measured the windows width with the
paper and then had his idea

   that carbon monoxide of fatal
quantity is formed by large gas burn-
ers in a closed small room is frequent-
ly attested by newspaper stories atid
is commonly known he saw he could
shut off the air by covering the win-
dows with his drawing paper and then
wondered how to fasten it on obvi-
ously no sort of thumbtacks as the
window frames were steel he then
perhaps thought of passepartout
which artists sometimes use and from
that naturally passed to adhesive tape

   he purchased the two rolls of ad-
hesive placed them in his pockets-
jergen noticed how they bulged-and
went to the roof and hermetically
sealed the windows with his heavy soft

paper by placing the edge of the tape
on the side of the protruding window
frames he had purposely left his
paper on the roof and went up after
allowing schwartz time to fall asleep

   he borrowed the clock rose at five
when it went off went to the roof
removed the paper and tape put the
material in a portfolio and started off
with it as he had planned after al-
lowing jergen to establish that he was
in bed he probably dropped the paper
in the river as he crossed on a ferry to
jersey

   marvelous said weems  thats
just what he said in his confession this
afternoon

   the adhesive would not leave a
mark visible to the eye on the side of
the steel frames but as your men
found when they carried out mv
orders the microscopic camera showed
the marks and enough of the sticky
matter could be scraped off to be ana-
lyzed you also found his finger-prints
on the spindles

   i eliminated wrangel as too im-
petuous and cholmondeley as too
stupid for that clever crime emily
might have done it but i think you will
find she and cholmondeley were mar-
ried during the night at connecticut
 amazing said weems  i was
over there just now and mrs
schwartz told me

   i think any of them might have
killed the poor old fellow if they had
been clever enough

   mrs schwartz was in high enough
spirits to-day weems said  here is
a check for five thousand as a small
token of the companys gratitude

   i wish youd have a repair man

tain curdy said whimsically  i dont

the faculty to think ahead and foresee
the ramifications of a problem even de-
fore it has been presented to you for
solution you are clear-minded and
discriminating and appear to have a
keen sense of the difference between
what is wise and unwise	v

  another thing i notice is that you
possess considerable business and tech-
nical ability and ought to be very suc-
cessful in everything you undertake in
the industrial world

  to come to your negative traits or
what i would call your  near vir-
tues you find it hard to make up
your mind especially about trivial
matters which however are of more
importance to us than the bigger
things of life you are rather unob-
servant and this leads you to overlook

factors which are essential in your siz-
ing up of a situation in other words
you look but you dont see

  you are the kind of fellow who
doesnt believe in telling all he knows
you like to keep a little reservoir of
facts for your own personal consump-
tion and not for the benefit of the rest
of society through this trait you are
apt to be called  dumb  by your fel-
lows while all the time you are usually
two jumps ahead of them

  you seem to be a  good sport and
enjoy going to places and doing things
the baseball and football campus
would have a great attraction for you
and anything pertaining to sport would
get your attention

  altogether you are a healthv-mind-

you are at the same time good na-

danger of your ever causing offense by
your frankness

  to come to your negative qualities
i notice that patience is one trait which
is conspicuous by its absence from your
personality you cannot refrain from
outbursts against those who bore you
or who you think are inferior you
love to get into an argument and this

who lives much more for the physical
side of life than for the mental in
other words you exercise your body
more than you do your mind your
disposition is essentially simple and
you dont believe in artificiality either
in your own personal life or in your
relations with others i like your re-
serve of patience and self-control you
are not easily riled over the hard
knocks that confront you from day to
day to you the latter are like water
on a ducks back

  for a man i think you are far too
reserved your desire to be unobtru-

yours lets people walk all over it you
like to be seen and not heard that
may be all right for children but no
fully grown man has any business to
act in that manner what you need
more than anything else is self-asser-

  i notice you have an essentially prac-
tical mind you go in for moderation
in all things you love order and dis-
like anything savoring of untidiness
i also see an affectionate strain in you
you are-not however very effusive in
your love-making you pour no per-
fume over your language when you ad-
dress your loved one you will never
turn any womans head with your elo-

women like both altogether you are
an individual who has as much a place
in the world as the prize fight promoter
or the politician your work is done
quietly and conscientiously and is
oftentimes of more value to humanity

  flashes from readers

             where readers and editor get together to gossip
             and argue and everyone speaks up his mind

one of the best known writers of
fact stories for detective fic-
tion weekly is robert w
sneddon author of  the killer who
couldnt forget  in this issue we
asked mr sneddon to give you an ac-
count of himself here it is

  though i have been an american for a
number of years my native heath is scotland
they used to say i looked and wrote like
stevenson but other critics have said  wrote
like merrick maupassant merimee barrie
and bierce and i defy any one to say i look
like them all i look like myself and write
like sneddon

  destined for the law i studied arts and
law at glasgow university i am both artful
and lawful but no lawyer while i was en-
grossing deeds in an edinburgh law office i
was attempting to write vaudeville sketches
and getting a knowledge of stage life then
 went to london and learned how easy it
was to lose money overnight in the theater
paris next saw me and gave me a liberal edu-
cation of sorts and then i sailed for new
york in quest of fame and fortune page
both for me boy ive been waiting for them
a long time in the drafty lobby

  i discovered that i could not get a living
honestly so i became a writer and satisfied
my ambitions within a month of landing
i was contributing to judge and puck 
tried fiction the forum took my first story-
of russian east side new york the swart
set a story laid in normandy and snappy
stories just born a parisian story and so
it runs ive written and sold hundreds dra-
matic whimsical highbrow lowbrow mostly
with european settings pictorial review
readers like my fantasy and probably would
not connect me with the gentleman who likes



to write about circus clowns side show folk
waiters old wrecks o humanity menjou
types mysterious evildoers gay young ladies
scottish clergymen and lawyers orphans ger-
man musicians and ghost hunters my  mark
shadow stories are guaranteed to outchill
any frigidaire

  for a time i figured in hundreds of columns
of newspaper reviews as the american barrie
this was while my play  the might-have-
beens was in vaudeville for two seasons
 camouflage  also played two seasons and
was turned into a sensational show at luna
park and little theaters have played others
little theaters write in please

  lots of people in england and the colonies
bought my novel galleons gold and then
 monsieur x a detective story with thrills
which has just been published in this country

  how did i come to be a crime expert you
ask because it was easier to write a crime
than to commit one i am a canny scot at
heart but i can honestly say that second to
the thrill i got when i heard a crowded theater
laugh and sob over my play comes the real
feeling of pleasure when some one writes in
and tells me or you friend editor that they
like my true stories of crime  try to make
them human as well as strictly accurate

 the westminster bank robbery

  here is a correction to  the rov-
ing  camera-eye  one of charles
somervilles stories and some addi-
tional light on the daring robbery men-
tioned in it

dear sir

  in your issue of january  mr somerville
in his entertaining sketches of  camera-eye
is somewhat inaccurate in his relation of the
westminster bank robbery


detective fiction weekly

  i can speak advisedly having been employed
in a logging camp near the vicinity at the
time

  the locale was the new westminster brit-
ish columbia branch of the bank of montreal
new westminster at that time was a city of
about twenty thousand people and is on the
frazer rivir about seventeen miles distant
from vancouver

  the canadian banking system is consider-
ably different from any united states system
it is in fact a chain banking system the
various banks are not independent and in-
dividual banks as in the united states but
are dependent banks subject to the head office
of the parent corporation consequently the
notes stolen from the bank did not bear on
them the name of westminster or any other
reference to new westminster the notes
however were numbered and bore the name
of the bank of montreal the amount stolen
was approximately three hundred thousand
dollars

  the date of the robbery was september
tqii and not some time prior to december
 as mr somerville has it

  it was a very smooth job as the bank was
next door to the police station and the police
didnt know anything about the matter until
the bank officials reported the robbery to them
the next morning

  prior to the war canada issued no metallic
money of greater value than the fifty-cent
piece dollar issues and greater were either
dominion treasury notes or bank notes the
treasury also issued a note of twenty-five
cents but this i understand has been discon-
tinued and outstanding notes called in

yours truly

hospital cheer

 from canada comes word that
detective fiction weekly is cheer-
ing up the boys in the central alberta
sanatorium

dear sir

  just a few words in praise of your maga-
zine  think it is the best magazine of its
kind on the market the quality and variety
of its stories cant be beat all the fellows
in the ward read it and they sure like it it
is more popular than free drinks in scotland

    read all the stories and i think the variety
is just right the true stories are very inter-
esting and many of them prove the old adage
that  the truth is stranger than fiction the
short stories are my dish and the more excit-
ing the better  also like a good serial
such as  the mystery maker  or  the three
crows those two were sure great

   i like the following characters particularly
riordan and brady calhoun tug norton
and craig kennedy  the riddle of the tor-
tillon  was certainly a thriller it was a pleas-
ant change from the ordinary run of serials
i would like to see more of its type in the
future

in closing i wish your magazine every suc-
cess and when better stories are written de-
tective fiction weekly will publish them
yours sincerely

he likes riordan

 the gentleman from denver likes
 the riordan stories if the voice of
 the people is a final proof he shows
 great judgment you and many thou-
 sands of others mr birch

 gentlemen 

 allow one more reader to put in a few
 words in regard to your magazine its great
 the best detective and mystery stories one
 can get anywhere for a thin dime my favor-
 ite character is riordan the hard-boiled but
 human police detective the other stories are
 good except the whitcher bemis which 
 cannot enjoy reading

 another thing i enjoy is the cipher codes
 running in the present series in fact we all
 have gone bughouse over them and there is
 almost a family row every wednesday eve-
 ning when i come home with a copy of
 flynns in my pocket

fulton reprinted herewith pro-
 vides a neat problem in vowel de-
termination ordinarily one seizes im-
mediately upon a predominating sym-
bol as a possible substitute for e the
most used letter but here the symbol

o	is somewhat baffling for the very
fact that it occurs no less than thirty-
two times

  in the average message the vowels
will total about forty per cent of the
whole number of letters on this basis
there should be about thirty-eight
vowels in the present example and
taking o as one vowel the other
vowels if any would probably have
to be represented by low frequency
symbols a rather unusual occurrence

  that o is a vowel however seems
clearly indicated by its use before and
after the doubled low frequency g in
the last group and by its conjunction
with the low frequency pairs wy and
hl in groups five and nine and that
this vowel is probably e is suggested by
the oo in group one and the penulti-
mate o occurring seven times in the
terminals -ot -op -or and -on

  the commonest two-letter endings
with e in this position are -cd -er -es
and -cn

  frequencies suggest p as s and
t as d with these values the first

speediest and substituting through-
out as shown deterrent and represent
both with the same letters missing are
next to fall the whole translation

it was in a japanese auction room that pat mur gey ran across the crazy
kimona-that cheap shoddy little garment with its amazingly riotous
design in crimson yellow and blue-which was destined to lead him into
one of the most puzzling situations of his eventful career

     at ten dollars and fifty cents pat murgey had apparently been swindled
on that kimona for all its hectic color and crazy design yet here was a suave
oriental offering him twenty-fifty-a hundred dollars for that same
kimona-and what puzzled pat was the fact that the japanese had stood idly
by and watched him while he bid the garment in

     pat murgey had bought that kimona for a girl he didnt want to sell it
besides there was something queer about a man who would let another bid in
an article and then offer him ten times what he paid for it

    pat kept the kimona

     then suddenly the very ground seemed to sprout menacing little yellow-
skinned figures rushing toward him from all directions

     and thus starts the intriguing series of adventures you will read about
next week in
