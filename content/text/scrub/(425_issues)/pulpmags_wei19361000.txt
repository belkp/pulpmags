sle of the undead

 by lloyd arthur eshbach

  ra gripping thrilling uncanny tale about the frightful fate that befell
  a yachting party on the dreadful island of living dead men

 a horror from the past

a drab gray sheet of cloud slipped
stealthily from the moons round
w face like a shroud slipping from
the face of one long dead a coldly phos-
phorescent face from which the eyes had
been plucked yellow radiance fell to-
ward a calm oily sea seeking a narrow
bank of fog lying low on the water pen-
etrating its somber mass like frozen yel-
low fingers

  vilma bradley shuddered and shrank
against clifford darrells brawny form
its-its ghastly cliff she said

  ghastly darrell leaned against the
rail laughing softly one cocktail too
many-thats the answer its given you
the jitters listen faintly from the
salon came strains of dance music and the
rhythmic shuffle of feet a nifty yacht
a south sea moon a radio dance orches-
tra dancers-and little clifford and you
call it ghastly almost savagely his arms
tightened about her and the bantering
note left his voice im crazy about you
vilma

  she tried to laugh but it was an un-
convincing sound its the moon cliff-
i guess i never saw it like that before

                                    


weird tales

somethings going to happen-something
dreadful i just know it

  oh-be sensible vilma there was
a hint of impatience in cliffs deep voice
a gorgeous girl in his arms-dark-haired
dark-eyed made for love-and she talked
of dreadful tilings which were going to
happen because the moon looked screwy

  she released herself and glanced out

over the aea i know im silly but-

her voice froze and her slender body
stiffened cliff-look

  darrell spun around and as he stared
he felt a dryness seeping into his throat
thoking him   

  out of the winding-sheet of fog into
the moonlight crept a strange strange
craft her crumbling timbers blackened
and rotted with incredible age the
corpse of a ship she seemed resurrected
from the grave of the sea her prow
thrust upward like a simitar bent back-
ward hovering over the gaunt ruin of a
cabin whose seaward sides were formed
by port aad starboard bows from a shal-
low pit amidships jutted the broken arm
of a mast its splintered tip pointing to-
ward the blindly watching moon the
stern thickly covered with the moldering
encrustations of age curved inward above
the strange high poop beneath which lay
another cabin and along either side of
her worm-eaten freeboard ran a row of
apertures like oblong portholes out of
these projected great oars long unwieldy
as sombirly black as the rest of the
ancient hulk

  now a sound drifted across the waters
the steady rhythmic br-rr-oom br-rr-oom
br-rr-oom of a drum beating time for the
rowers its hollow thud checked the
heart set it to throbbing in tempo with
ks own weary pulse ghostly fingers
dripping dread crawled up darrells
spine

  stiff-lipped vilma gasped what-
what is it

   cliff answered in a dry husky voice the
words seeming to trip over an awkward
tongue its-its-it cant be damn it
-but its a galley a ship from the days
of alexander the great whats it doing
-here-now

  closer she came through the moon-
path a frothing lip of brine curling away
from her swelling prow closer-her
course crossing that of the ariel-and the
watchers saw her crew they gasped and
the blood ebbed from their faces

  men of ancient persia clad in leather
kirtles and rusted armor and they were
hideous in the yellow moon-glow cliff
could see them clearly now-a lookout
standing motionless in the stem the
steersman on the poop-deck the drummer
squatting beside the broken mast the
rowers in the pit-and all all were a
bloodless white the skin of their faces
puffed and bloated and horribly wrinkled
like flesh that had been under water a
long time

  dead men   men whose movements
were stiffly wooden  as dead as their
faces but most horrible was the fact that
they were there that they moved at all

queer mirage isnt it a hollow
voice spoke suavely behind them

  vilma gasped at the sudden sound and
they whirled a foot away stood the tall
lean figure of the ariels captain leon
corio a queer smile twisted his thin
lips

  whats the idea-sneaking up on
us darrell demanded angrily he
didnt like this man hadnt liked him
from the moment he had approached
cliff to sell him the yacht but cliff had
bought the craft because she was a bar-
gain and in accordance with their agree-
ment he had hired corio as captain

  the tall mans smile remained fixed
and he bowed gravely sorry sir i al-
ways walk softly a habit i suppose
isle of the undead

 

he gestured toward the galley it looks
quite life-like dont you think so

  life-like cliff spoke between his
teeth as he again faced the black ship
 it looks dead to me

  the galley had almost readied them
now veering sharply to draw up beside
the ariel the drum quieted and the
oars trailed in the water motionless ex-
cept for the swaying imparted by the
waves a musty age-old odor filtered
through the air like a breath from a
grave the music and dancing had
stopped a fear-filled hush shrouded the
yacht

  vilma drew cliffs arm about her
shoulder he glanced back at the motion-
less captain

  do something corio he rasped
 dont stand there like a dummy

  corio nodded with his same queer
smile his hand darted to an inside
pocket came out bearing a curious in-
strument like four twisted cones of silver
bound together widi silver thongs as he
raised diis to his mouth his eyelids were
slits behind which burned the embers of
his eyes

  out over the sea crept a single note
deep hollow laden with eery minor wait-
ings-a sound that summoned impera-
tively yet a sound that repelled it was a
moan hideous as the moan of a dying
demon it raked the heart with fear-
tipped claws it rose and fell and rose
again and as it died it awakened the
crew of the ancient galley to motion
sweeping them in a horde to the rail of
the yacht

  cliff swung toward corio in bursting
fury fury mingled with dread his fist
lashed out at that glittering silver instru-
ment and the face behind it but corio
avoided him like a wraith still smiling
fixedly the horn again at his lips cliff
cursed and hurled himself through the
air one hand caught a bony shoulder

he felt fingers like hooks close on his
own throat he wrenched free landing a
stunning blow on corios face-saw him
reel and crash to the deck-and then he
heard vilma scream

  he whirled she was struggling be-
tween two of the bobby-faced things from
the galley in an instant he was upon
them his fist thudding against icy flesh
burying itself in something horribly soft
and yielding startled cliff swung a sec-
ond blow and an arm tomb-cold and
strong as the tentacle of an octopus
wrapped itself around him-a vise of
thin-covered bone a dead drowned face
peered over his shoulder staring blankly
other arms seized his legs and though he
struggled and writhed with the strength
of a mounting fear he was borne to the
rail over they went and dropped to the
rotting deck of the galley

  a numbness was creeping through him
like a contagion spreading from those
crushing hands of ice his struggles
ceased widi eyes that turned stiffly in
their sockets he looked for vilma saw
her raised high above the heads of two
other pallid creatures saw them climb
over the rail then the blackness of a
dank and musty cabin enveloped him
and he was dropped with jarring force
his captors bulked black against the
moonlit doorway treading soundlessly
and were gone

  cliff lay in rigid paralysis every sense
keenly alive his mind striving to clutch
a single spar of reason in this chaotic
whirlpool of the incredible this couldnt
be soon hed awaken to laugh at his ab-
surd nightmare  yet it seemed hor-
ribly real  it was real

  from the ariel boiled a fearful bed-
lam screams of terror curses then
other shadows loomed in the doorway
and vilma motionless and rigid was
dropped brutally beside him on the
spongy floor


weird tales

  furiously cliff strugged against the
maddening restraint of paralysis he
couldnt lie here helpless vilma needed
him hed-hed have to do something
wiht an effort that studded his forehead
with rounded drops of sweat and sent the
blood throbbing through the distended
veins of his neck he sought to move
and like a cord snapping his invisible
bonds fell from him

  he was crouching over vilma rubbing
her wrists calling to her when again he
heard the silver horn of corio a low
droning utterly unlike the note that had
awakened the galleys crew it drifted
languidly along a channel of endless
sleep it seeped through the ear-drums
touching every nerve-tip with resistless
lassitude doggedly cliff fought against
the sound pressing his hands over his
ears gritting his teeth holding his eye-
lids wide yet he felt his muscles weaken
began to relax knew dimly that his mind
sodden with drowsiness was creeping to-
ward the pits of slumber-and the vi-
brant drone ended

his head cleared rapidly and he bent
over vilma as he touched a limp
arm he knew she had passed from paraly-
sis into a deep quiet sleep he shook her
it was useless he listened heard her
steady breathing and at that instant real-
ized that the noises from the yacht had
ceased

  rising he strode toward the square of
chalky moonlight a foot away he halted
fell back he had heard a faint footfall
had seen an armor-clad figure climbing
over the rail with silent haste he flung
himself down beside vilma

  and there he lay while the crew of the
galley carried his friends from the ariel
all slumped in that unnatural sleep and
stretched them out on the floor of the
black cabin unmoving he watched
through narrow lids till all save corio

had been carried aboard and the drowned
things had gone back to their places in
the rowers pits again the hollow voice
of the drum began throbbing through the
silence and the oars creaked a faint ac-
companiment he could feel the galley
cleaving the oily sea

  on his feet he peered through the
doorway the backs of the rowers rose
and fell with stiff mechanical rhythm
beyond the galleys stem came the yacht
slinking along like a thief only one dim
light showing her diesel engines purring
almost soundlessly

  he turned and bent over vilma still
in thrall to that strange deep slumber
as he traced the delicate outlines of her
lovely face now so lifeless and pale bit-
ter wrath flared within him wrath and
hatred for leon corio but as he thought
of the ghastly undead things out there in
the galley pit thought of this water-
soaked anachronism which had no right
to be afloat his skin crisped with a sense
of foreboding a fear of what was yet to
come he must do something

  stepping over the still forms of his
friends he moved to the forward wall
where a beam of radiance crept fearfully
through a gap between two boards his
hands touched the hull-and he jerked
them away rotten clammy like a de-
cayed corpse partly frozen crouching
he peered through

  far ahead a blotch of evil blackness
squatted on the horizon an island crouch-
ing low like a black beast ready to spring
around it the moonlight seemed to dim
as though it were striving to hide some
nameless horror interminably cliff
watched while the shadowed mass drew
closer    closer   

  they were headed for a towering wall
of black basalt and as the galley neared
it cliff saw that it bore striking resem-
blance to a gigantic human skull its
rounded surface broken by caves that the
isle of the undead



sea had carved into hollow eye-sockets and
an empty nasal cavity the rock wall
ended high above the water beneath it
lay a gaping chasm of pitchy darkness
and the galley drum silenced oars at
rest slid under the ledge into the mouth
of the skull

  just before total blackness fell cliff
sprang to vilmas side and raised her in
his arms if he hoped to do anything he
must do it now he groped his way to
the starboard bow and moved one hand
along the dank timbers searching he
found what he sought a wide gap at the
edge of a board gently lowering vilma
to the floor he gripped the slimy wood
with both hands and thrust outward
mightily a wide strip of decayed tim-
ber burst free he dropped it into the
sea and attacked the next board in mo-
ments a wide irregular opening yawned
in the galleys hull

  leaning out cliff looked down he
could see nothing then suddenly a faint
light appeared and he heard the hum of
the ariels motors as she entered the cave
the humming ceased instantly but the
faint light persisted

  now he could see the blackness of wa-
ters a rock wall beyond he drew bade-
and as he did so he heard movements on
deck at any moment the rowers might
enter hed have to risk a drop into the
water with vilma-there was nothing
else to do if only she were conscious

  he stooped and raised her holding her
firmly with one arm gripping the hull
with the other he climbed through the
opening inhaled deeply and dropped a
heart-stopping plunge-and cold water
closed over them down down-then
they shot upward reached the surface
and even as cliff gulped a single gasping
breath something struck his skull a blind-
ing stunning blow the oars

  with rapidly numbing arms and legs
cliff kicked and flailed the water striving

for land dimly he knew he no longer
held vilma dimly he visioned her as
were those ghastly undead then his body
scraped on something hard and a black-
ness that was not physical blotted out con-
sciousness

	the dreadful isle

red-hot hammers pounding against
 his temples wakened cliff darrell
he opened his eyes to stare into total
darkness crawling with mental monsters
spawned by his pain-stabbed brain he
lay half immersed in shallow brine his
head resting on a jagged stone just above
the surface struggling to his hands and
knees he shook his head from side to
side dumbly like an animal in pain
something had hit him-and now he was
in water-and there was no light what
had happened where was vilma

  vilma he groaned he remembered
now they had dropped-and his head
had struck something - and - and -
maybe she was floating out there even
now dead eyes staring upward

  vilma he cried his voice pleading
vilma

  only a mocking echo answered him
there was no other sound not even the
whisper of waves swishing among the
rocks

  cliff pressed his hands fiercely against
his throbbing head the pain had become
a madness matched only by the agony of
his own helplessness he felt his reason
reeling he fought an insane desire tar
fling himself shrieking into that silent
expanse of water to search for vilma
then with a tremendous physical effort he
jarred himself back to sanity

  he staggered to his feet groped stum-
blingly over the rocks away from the wa
ter his hand touched a rock wall broken
and pitted by the action of the sea and
he crept stowljr inland feeling his wajr


weird tales

like a blind man as he plodded on his
thoughts blended into one fixed idea he
must get to light must get light to search
for vilma

  gradually the insensate pounding in
his head abated and strength returned to
his body when at last he saw light be-
yond a narrow fissure around an angle in
the cavern he had almost recovered in
moments he was gazing out over a plain
bathed in the glow of a leprous moon
as he stared he shivered and it was not
because of the cold draft drawing through
the fissure fanning his brine-drenched
body

  grim and starkly forbidding the plain
lay before him dead as the frozen land-
scape of the moon once there had been
life there but now only the skeletons of
trees remained lifting their wasted limbs
in rigid pleading to an unresponsive sky
some there were that had fallen up-
rooted by the fury of passing hurricanes
these lay like the scattered bones of a
dismembered giant age-blackened and
painted with hoarfrost by the brushes of
moonlight feebly the dead forest stirred
under the touch of a moaning wind and
the gaunt shadows cast by the trees
seemed to be multi-armed monsters slith-
ering over the rocky earth

  he looked beyond the trees and he
saw light little squares of pale radiance
cut high in the walls of an ancient black
castle castle cliff frowned he could
liken it to nothing else though he could
not recall ever having seen a castle which
thrust curving needle-thin spires into the
sky like a devils horns

  impatiently cliff stepped from the wall
of rock and glanced along a path that
writhed through the forest glanced-
and crouched swiftly a low cry escaping
him a single spot of water on a smooth
flat stone a spot shaped like a womans
shoe vilma had passed this way

  but-might it not have been some

other woman from the ariel no they
had been carried-and even if they had
walked their feet were dry

  like a hound on the scent cliff dar-
rell sped along the serpentine path the
wind moaned above him and the sough-
ing branches seemed to whisper croaking
warnings but he ran on his eyes con-
stantly seeking signs of vilroas course
here a drop of water shaken from her
drenched skirt there another and cliff
blessed the full moon whose light made
possible his trailing of the almost invis-
ible spoor

  now he had passed beyond the dead
forest and was moving toward the castle
the trail had been growing steadily faint-
er but he managed to follow it it led
him toward a narrow stone stairway
climbing crookedly to a misshapen open-
ing in the wall light glowed faintly lu-
rid somewhere deep within and now
cliff heard a blasphemous sound belch
from the depths of the castle-a wheez-
ing sardonic croaking like the moan of a
demoniac organ rumbling an obscene
dirge his hair bristled and he stopped
short

  he looked at the steps searching for
the fading trail-and he stiffened there
on the second step was an irregular blotch
of moisture what did it mean had
vilma crouched there had she ascended
those steps entered

with drawn face he began to skirt
the base of the black building
searching every nook and cranny scan-
ning the bare walls his heart lay like
ballast in his breast if-if something
had lured vilma into that demon-infested
vault  he checked the thought

  suddenly he cursed mechanically he
had begun to measure his stride in time
with the doleful dirge from the castle
he stalked on widi altered pace as he
rounded the comer at the rear of the
isle of the undead



structure he saw a shadow outlined
against the sky crouching on a ledge be-
low one of the little windows he looked
again-cried

  vilma

  the figure above him stirred looked
down then climbed hastily earthward it
was vilma    vilma with black hair
hanging stringily about her head face
pale eyes fixed in the wideness of fear
   vilma with her wet clothing cling-
ing to the lovely contours of her symmet-
rical body

  oh cliff she gasped a dry sob
choking her thank god-thank god

  she clung to him her face hidden
against his shoulder quivering uncon-
trollably then tears came saving tears
relieving her pent-up emotions

  cliff said nothing only held her close
strongly protective and gradually he
felt the tempest of terror subside at last
she looked up some of the dread had
gone from her face and she tried to
smile

  i guess-i cant take it she said

  cliff shook his head solemnly youre
a game girl vilma youve nerve enough
for two men if you can tell me what
happened of if youd rather let it wait
just say so

   til feel better if i get it off my chest
she said you probably saw those-
things-carry me from the yacht cliff
nodded well i was just about para-
lyzed when they dropped me in their ter-
rible boat i remember you tried to
arouse me then that horn blew and i
just seemed to float away in an ocean of
sleep

  after that i can remember nothing
till i awoke with water filling my eyes
and nose and mouth choking me some-
ones arms were around me-it must have
been you cliff-and then they werent
there any more and i struggled wildly
out of my wits i dont know how i got

to shore but i did and i lay there in the

shadow of the galley choking and gag-
ging but afraid to cough it wasnt alto-
gether dark and i could see those dread-
ful things with people hanging over their
shoulders carrying them along a narrow
ledge close to the waters edge heading
inland i thought maybe you were one of
those limp bodies and i-i almost died
of fright after a while the last one had
gone and the light went out then i
heard another pair of feet moving over
the rocks corio i suppose the sound
died-and i was alone

  that place was awful cliff the
blackness almost drove me mad i wanted
to scream but i was afraid to some ter-
rible weight seemed to be crushing my
lungs if i followed those undead things
they might capture me but it seemed
worse to stay there in that dreadful dark

  i got out of there somehow though
it seemed to take hours then i didnt
know what to do i stood at the edge of
the dead forest trying to decide trying
too to keep myself from shrieking and
running-anywhere then corios horn
blew again-a sound cliff worse than
anything ive ever heard it-it was a
wicked sound promising to fulfill every
foul desire that ever tainted a human
mind it repelled yet it lured irresistibly
and-i answered

  she stopped and buried her face in
her hands after a moment she went on
the sound stopped just as i found my-
self crawling on hands and knees up the
stone stairway on the other side another
started-that awful groaning-music-
but it didnt draw me i ran down the
steps and scurried away like a rabbit try-
ing to find a place to hide

  after a while i came back-i thought
you must be in there-and i climbed up
to the window and-and-cliff its
hellish

  her eyes boring into bis widened in


weird tales

the same rigid terror he had seen in them
when he joined her

  we could go back to the cove and get
away on the ariel vilma cliff said
stonily and if you think we should
we will but-i brought our friends here
and-well i want to get them out if i
can

  with an effort vilma nodded of
course we cant do anything else

  he released her and stepped up to the
wall

  tm going to see whats going on in
there he said you wait here till i
come down

  in sudden dread vilma seized his arm
no cliff i couldnt stand waiting here
alone ill go with you

  he nodded understanding and to-
gether they began climbing the precipi-
tous wall fitting hands and feet in step-
like crevices that made progress fairly
rapid soon they were crouching on a
wide stone ledge clinging to thin rusted
bars staring into the black castle

	the steps of torture

a gigantic hall lay before them a sin-
gle chamber whose walls were the
walls of the castle whose arched ceiling
rose far above them directly below their
window a stone platform jutted from the
wall spreading entirely across the cham-
ber a stone altar squatted in the center
of the platform a strangely phosphores-
cent lire smoldering on its top and from
the altar descended a wide wide stairway
ending in the middle of the hall all this
cliff saw in a single sweeping glance af-
terward he had eyes for nothing save the
lethal horror of a mad mad scene re-
vealed by the dim radiance of the altar
fire

  behind the altar stood five huge figures
clad in long hooded cloaks of scarlet
the central figure had arms raised wide

his cloak spread like the wings of some
bloody bird of prey and from his lips
came a guttural incantation a blasphe-
mous chant in archaic latin in time with
the wheeze of the buried organ now his
arms dropped and he was silent

  from the room below came a concerted
whine of ceremonial devotion a hollow
hungry wail it rose from the bloodless
lips of strangely assorted human figures
ranging down the center of the long stair-
way in two facing columns a hundred
or more there must have been represent-
ing half as many periods and countries
according to their strange and ancient cos-
tumes men in the armor of medieval
persia-the crew of the black galley yel-
low-haired vikings hawk-faced egyp-
tians with leather-brown skins half-naked
islanders red-sashed pirates from the
spanish main men of today and about
all like the dampness that clings to a
tombstone hovered a cloud of-death
the undead

  cliffs gaze roved over the tensely wait-
ing columns then leaped to the foot of
the stairs there cowering dumbly like
sheep in a slaughter-pen were his friends
from the ariel all clothing had been
stripped from them and they stood wait-
ing in waxen statuesque stiffness he saw
then that three others lay prone before
the stone altar naked and ominously still

  and far down at the very end of the
hall stood leon corio draped in a hood-
ed cape of unbroken black a glint of sil-
ver in his hand-his hom of drugging
sounds

  now as though at a silent command a
girl left the group and began to mount
the stairs as those motionless three must
have mounted vivacious ann-she had
been the life of giffs yacht party but
now she was-changed her blanched
face was rigid with inexpressible terror
despite the semi-stupor which numbed
her senses her nude body glowed like
isle of the undead



marble in the dim light horribly her
feet began their climb with a little catch
step suggested by the moaning chant of
that cracked organ note

  she reached the first of the undead
and cliff saw light glint on a knife-blade
a crimson gash appeared in the flesh of
her thigh and dead lips touched that
wound drank thirstily the girl strode
on blood gleaming darkly on the white
skin a second drank of the crimson
flow-a third-and the blood ceased
gushing forth

  another knife flashed-and lips closed
again and again on a redly dripping
wound and the girl with the unchanging
pace of a robot climbed the stairway to
its very top-climbed while fiendish
corpses drank her lifes blood-climbed
to sink down on the altar

  one of the red-clad figures stooped
over her lifted her buried long teeth in
her throat-and cliff saw his face   
his own face paled and talons of fear
raked his brain those others on the stairs
-they were abhorrent zombies freed
from die grave but this monster a
vampire vested with the lust and cruelty
and power of hell

  he lowered her finally and she sank
down lay still beside the other three

  another began the hellish climb a
giant of a man with a thickly muscled
torso cliff knew him instantly and his
heart seemed to stop leslie starke
theyd played football together a brave
man-a fighter he mounted the stair-
way with the same little catch step the
same plodding stiffness no resistance
no struggle-only a hell of fear on his
face

  the marrow melted from cliff dar-
rells bones what-what could he do
against a power that did that to les
starke he tried to swallow but the sa-
liva had dried on his tongue he wanted
to turn to vilma but he could not wrench

his eyes from the frightful spectacle

  up the stone steps starke strode and
no blade leaped toward him no thirsty
lips closed on his flesh in an unwaver-
ing line he mounted toward the cowled
monster in the center of the dais like a
puppet on the end of a string mounted
to pause before the stone altar to lie on
it head bent back throat bared   
mercifully cliff regained enough control
to close his eyes

  he opened them at a gasp from vilma
saw the vampire raise the flaccid body of
les starke and hurl it far from him to
crash to the stone steps to roll and thud
and tumble down and down sickening-
ly to lie awkwardly twisted on the floor
before his companions

  and another began to climb the long
stone steps   

  all through the interminable night
cliff and vilma crouched on the ledge
staring through the barred window a
hundred times they would have fled to
escape the maddening scene but they
could not move senses reeled before the
awful monotony of the ceaseless climb-
ing their eyes smarted with fixed staring
their tongues and throats were parched
to desert dryness yet only after hours of
endless watching only after the last vic-
tim had climbed the steps did the edge
of terror dull and a modicum of control
return to their bodies

  stiffly cliff looked over his shoulder
a faint tinge of gray rimmed the sea on
the eastern horizon

  almost daylight he whispered
hoarsely

  vilma nodded her gaze still held by
that chamber of horror cliff followed
the direction of her eyes and saw corio
standing like a great bat in his hooded
cape close to the far wall he raised his
four-piped horn to his lips and the in-
struments fourth note crept through the
room


weird tales

it was a doleful sound a cry like the
cry death itself might possess yet
oddly-and horribly-it was soothing
promising the peace of endless sleep
and touched by its power the columns
of undead stiffened thinned to wraiths
flowed as water flows down the stone
steps vanished

  the dead-alive-those five vampires in
crimson cowls-looked upward uneasily
the shadows under the roof were gray-
ing with the light of dawn cliff could
sense their thought before sunrise they
must be in their tombs under the castle
to sleep until another night with one
accord they strode down the stairs past
corio who had prostrated himself and
entered a black opening in the wall
with their departure the altar fire
dimmed to a sullen ember

  corio arose he was alone in the
chamber save for that dead broken body
lying in a twisted heap at the foot of the
stairs and those other half-alive wretches
stretched out before the altar now cliff
told himself was the time for him to get
 there at corio now was the time to
rescue his friends-but he continued to
crouch unmoving

  again corio blew on his silver horn
and a faint cry leaped from vilmas
tensed lips the luring note that had
drawn her cliff thought hazily then he
thought of nothing save the sound the
sound that promised him all he could
desire earth and its dominion his for
die taking-if he answered that call   
then even the sound eluded his senses
and he heard only the promise  he
must answer must claim what was right-
fully his

  but those half-dead creatures-sight of
their stirring steadied his staggering
sanity here and there heads lifted and
bloodless husks of bodies tried to rise
in the pallid light they seemed like
corpses freed from newly opened graves

some could only reach their knees others
rose to uncertain limbs and all moved
down the stairway toward corio answer-
ing his summons followed as he made
his slow way toward the opening in the
wall still blowing the single note-the
note that promised earth and all it
held   

  cliff glanced toward vilma-and she
was not there he looked down saw her
far below dropping from crack to crevice
with amazing speed and daring hasten-
ing toward-corio

  the thought jarred any lingering taint
of allurement from cliffs mind he
must stop her he swung around ignor-
ing the cramped stiffness of his legs and
started down the steep wall down
down recklessly with corios hom-note
only a faintly heard sound fading behind
him

  now he saw vilma reach the rocks
below and dash around the corner of the
castle and he cursed redoubling his
speed down-down-and suddenly the
ancient rock crumbled underfoot for an
instant he hung from straining fingertips
-then dropped

  a smashing impact-a stone that slid
beneath him-and his head crashed
against the castle wall through a fiery
mist of pain he pictured vilma in the
grasp of corio the mist thickened-
grew black-engulfed him

	in corios hands

cliff awoke with the sun glaring
down on his face he opened his
eyes and stabbing lances of light
pierced his eyeballs momentarily
blinded he pressed his hands across
his face and struggled erect there was a
sick feeling in his stomach and the back
of his head throbbed incessantly he
touched the aching area and winced a
lump like an egg thrust out his scalp
isle of the undead



it was sticky with blood he stood there
weaving from side to side trying to recall
something   

  as memory came he groaned vilma
he had last seen her racing madly toward
corio lured by his damned horn it was
daylight now the sun had risen at least
an hour ago an hour-with vilma
gone

   shaking his head to clear it and grit-
ting his teeth at the pain he stalked along
the wall turning the corner he strode
on toward the crooked steps the life-
less terrain reeled dizzily but he went
on resolutely the pain in his head was
fading to a dull ache and as he mounted
the steps strength seemed to flow back
into his legs with every sense taut he
passed into the gloom of the castle

  a quick glance he cast about-saw the
body of starke lying where it had fallen
no use to examine it there was no life
there his gaze swept up the slope of
the stairway to the altar at its head
lingered on the phosphorescent eye of
light still glowing there then he
shrugged grimly and moved on to the
doorway in the wall warily he peered
in

  as his eyes adjusted themselves to the
greater darkness he saw a narrow stair-
way leading downward into a shadowy
corridor somewhere in the tunnels
depths a faint light shone he could see
nothing more he moved stealthily down
the damp dank stairs

  at the bottom he paused listening
he could hear nothing a hundred feet
ahead the corridor divided in two a
burning torch was thrust in the wall at
the junction cliff nodded with satisfac-
tion corio must be somewhere near by
for only a human needed light

   silently cliff strode along the corridor
at the fork he hesitated then chose the
right branch for light glowed faintly

along that passageway the other led
downward black as the pits of hell

  a doorway appeared in the wall ahead
and he moved warily with fists clenched
flickering torchlight filtered into the cor-
ridor there was no audible sound now
cliff peered into a small chamber and
gasped in sudden horror his eyes staring
unwinkingly at a spectacle incredibly
pitiful

  here were the passengers of the ariel
whitely naked and lying in little groups
on the cold stone floor huddled together
for warmth their faces turned toward
darrell as he stood in the doorway but
there was no recognition in the vacuous
eyes no thought no intelligence and
little life in the wide-mouthed stares it
seemed as though their souls had beea
drained from their bodies with their
blood

  sickened cliff turned away cursing
his own helplessness to aid them cursing
leon corio who was responsible for
their plight black wrath gripped him
as he moved on

  again the corridor branched and
again he kept to the right suddenly he
halted ears straining he heard the
sound of a voice-the hollow voice of
corio it came faintly but clearly from a
room at the end of the passageway cliff
went forward slowly

  and so my dear corio was saying
we entered into a pact with the-
master a pact sealed with blood ia
exchange for our lives we three were to
bring other humans to this island for the
feasting of the dead-alive every third
month each of us must return with our
cargo when the moon is full and since
we come back on alternating months
they have a constant supply of fresh
blood usually some of our captives live
from full moon to full moon before thejr
become like those of die galley-the un-
dead some of these we waken when k


weird tales

suits our fancy they are not like the
masters they awaken only when we call
them-we three or the masters

  more than life they give us for what
we do centuries ago pirates used this
island for refuge they-died-and they
left their treasure in this castle it lies in
the room where the masters lie and we
three receive payment in gold and gems
tonight i receive my pay and tomorrow
i leave on the ariel-and you go with
me

  cliff heard vilma answer and even
while his heart leaped with relief he
marveled at the cool scorn in her voice

  so i go with you do i id rather
climb the stairs with the rest of your
victims than have anything to do with
you-you monster when cliff darrell
finds you-

  darrell corios voice was a frozen
sneer hell do nothing ill find him
-and hell wish he could climb the
stairs of blood as for you youll go
with me and like it a drop of my blood
in your veins and you will belong to the
master as i do we shall attend to
that but first there is something else-
more pleasant his words fell to an
indistinguishable purr

  still moving stealthily cliff hastened
forward suddenly vilma screamed and
he launched himself madly across the re-
maining distance stood crouching at the
threshold

  vilma lay on an ancient bed her wrists
and ankles bound with leather thongs
drawn about the four tall bed-posts only
the tom remnants of her under-garments
covered the rounded contours of her
body and corio crouched over her ca-
ressing the pink flesh vilma writhed
beneath his touch

cliff growled deep in his throat as he
sprang corio spun around and
leaped aside but he was too slow to es-

cape cliff s powerful lunge oar hand
closed on his thin neck and the other a
rock-like fist made a bloody ruin of his
mouth howling with pain corio tried
to sink his teeth in cliffs arm

  cliff flung him aside following with
the easy glide of a boxer corio crawled
to his feet cringing dodging before the
nemesis thar stalked him again cliff
leaped and corio yellow with fear
darted around the bed and ran wildly into
the hallway at the door cliff checked
himself reason holding him corio
could elude him with ease in this
labyrinth of passages and his first con-
cern was vilmas safety

  he returned to the bed vilma looked
up at him with such relief and thankful-
ness on her face that cliff with a little
choked cry flung himself to his knees
beside the bed and kissed her hungrily
for moments their lips clung then cliff
straightened shakily trying to laugh

  weve got to get out of here sweet-
heart he said im not afraid of
corio but he knows things about this
place that we dont know after youre
safe on the yacht ill come bade and get
him

  he looked around for something with
which to cut her bonds on the wall
above the bed were crossed a pair of
murderous-looking cutlases seizing one
of these cliff wrendied it from its
fastenings and drew it through the
cords    she stood beside him free

  your clothing- cliff began his

eyes on her almost-nude body

  she blushed and pointed mutely to a
heap of rags on the floor her eyes
flamed wrathfully he-he ripped them
from me

  the muscles of cliffs jaws knotted
and he scowled as he surveyed the room
for a drape or hanging to cover her for
the first time he really saw the place all
the lavish splendor of royalty had beta
isle of the undead



expended on this chamber it might have
been the bedroom of a king except that
the ancient furnishings belonged to no
particular period were in fact the loot
of raids extended over centuries yet de-
spite its splendor everything was repul-
sive cloaked with the same air of un-
earthly gloom that hovered about the
galley

  he moved toward an intricately woven
tapestry but vilma checked him shud-
dering with revulsion

  no cliff-its too much like grave
clothes everything about this place
makes my flesh crawl id rather stay
as i am than touch any of it

  cliff nodded slowly lets go then
they hurried through the corridors
toward the stairway with cliff holding
die cutlas in readiness as they passed
the room in which lay the ariels pas-
sengers he tried to divert vilmas atten-
tion but she looked in as though
hypnotized

  i saw them before she whispered
tts awful

  as they started up the stairway to
the great hall cliff took the lead he
moved with utmost caution

  it doesnt seem right he said un-
easily we should hear from corio
at that moment they did hear from
him-literally from somewhere in the
maze of tunnels came the sound of his
accursed horn-the note of sleep it
swirled insidiously about their heads
numbing their senses cliff felt his
stride falter saw vilma stumble and he
hurled himself forward furiously grip-
ping her arm

  hurry he shouted striving to pierce
the fog of sleep weve got to get out
damn him

  vilma rallied for an instant and they
reached the top of the stairs on-across
that wide wide room each step a
struggle    on while the droning

sound floated languidly through every
nerve cell    on-till their muscles
could no longer move and they sagged
to the hard stone asleep

moments later cliff opened his eyes
to meet the hellish glare of leon
corio corio smiled thinly

  so-you awaken good i would
have you know the fate i have planned
for you you see this he held the
cutlas high above darrells throat like
the blade of a guillotine with this i
could end your life quite painlessly and
quickly it really would prove entertain-
ing for miss bradley im sure he
chuckled faintly behind bruised and
swollen lips

  cliff squirmed striving to rise then
subsided instantly he was bound hand
and foot

   could kill you corio repeated
musingly but that would lade finesse
his teeth bared in a feline smile and
it would be such a waste-of blood
instead ill take you out to the galley and
let you lie there till her crew awakens
tonight they have tasted blood and
after tonight will taste none again for
another month i imagine theyll-drain
you dry the last phrase was a vicious
snarl

  cliff heard vilma utter a suppressed
sob and he turned his head she lay close
by bound like him with strips of leather
furiously cliff strained at his fetters
but they held

  and while you wait for those gentle
persians to awaken corio continued in
tones caressingly soft you can think o
your sweetheart in my arms it may
teach you not to strike your betters-
though you can never profit by youc
lesson

  stooping he raised cliffs powerful
form and managed to fling him over one
shoulder then he moved from the great


weird tales

hall down the stone steps and across the
dead plain with its sighing skeleton
trees he was panting jerkily by the time
he came to the fissure leading to the
cove but he reached it despite cliffs
two hundred pounds without pausing
he went on into the cavern along the
rock ledge to step at last upon the deck
of the black galley

  pleasant thoughts he said gently as
he dropped cliff to the spongy boards
you have only to wait till dark

   cliff listened to his rapid footfalls till
they died in distance then there was no
sound save his own breathing

  gradually his eyes became accustomed
to the heavy gloom and he saw that
corio had dropped him just at the edge
of the rowers pit there were white
things down there-bones pale as
marble scattered about aimlessly could
-could those bones join to make the
rowers who would arise with the night
it seemed absurd-was absurd-yet he
knew it was so he had seen too much
to doubt it

  he rolled over on his back and stared
upward into the shadows he must lie
here helpless while corio returned to
vilma-did with her as he pleased
perhaps he might even transform her
into a blood-tainted monster like himself
he saw her again in that room of
ancient splendor spread-eagled to the
bed and the muscles corded in his arms
and his lips strained white in a futile
effort to break free

  interminably he lay there waiting the
galley was damp with the chilling damp-
ness of a sepulcher and the dampness
penetrated deeper and deeper clamping
his jaws together to prevent their quiver-
ing he struggled against a rising tide of
madness which gnawed at his reason
his mind began to crunch and jangle
like a machine out of gear threatening
to destroy itself

  on and on in plodding indifference
the stolid moments passed till at last
cliff realized that it was growing darker
he rolled over on his side and stared
into the galley pit eyes fixed on the
inert masses of white soon they would
move soon the undead would rise his
thoughts touched by the whips of dread
sped about like slaves seeking escape from
a torture pit and abruptly out of the
welter of chaotic ideas came one straw
of sanity he seized it his heart hammer-
ing with hope

  those persian sailors were armed
their swords and knives were real for
they cut flesh somewhere among their
bones must lie sharp-edged blades

  he struggled to the edge of the pit
let his feet drop over as they touched
he balanced precariously for an instant
then fell to his knees he peered fever-
ishly about among white bones molder-
ing garments and rusted armor-and
saw a faint glimmer of light on pointed
steel he sank forward on his face in
the direction of the gleam turned over
squirmed and writhed till he felt the
cold blade against his hands he caught
it between his fingers and began sawing
back and forth

  it was heart-breaking work age had
dulled die weapon and long slivers of
rust flaked off but the leather which
bound him was also ancient though
progress was slow and the effort labori-
ous cliff knew his bonds were
weakening

  but it was growing darker even now
he could see only a suggestion of gray
among the shadows if those undead
things materialized while he lay among
them    sweat stood out on his fore-
head and he redoubled his efforts strain-
ing at the leather as he sawed

  with a snap the cords parted and his
hands were free a single slash severed
the thongs about his ankles and he stood

                     w t-
isle of the undead



up leaped to the deck not an instant
too soon there was movement in the
pit-a hideous crawling of bones as-
sembling themselves into skeletal
form   

  cliff waited to see no more there
were limits to what one could see and
remain sane with a bound he crossed
the rotting deck and sprang ashore
despite the dark he almost ran from
the madness of that cave ran till he
passed through the wall of rock till he
saw the rim of the moon gleaming be-
hind the castle

	the end of the island

out on the plain he sprinted through
the ghostly forest he knew he had
no time to spare-knew that soon the
march of torture would begin-knew
that if vilma were within the castle she
must answer the summons of corios
horn even now light glowed faintly in
the high square windows

  that horn at the foot of the steps
he stopped short if he heard the horn
he too must answer he dared not risk
it with impatient fingers he tore a strip
of cloth from his shirt rolled it into a
cylinder and thrust it into his ear an-
other for the other ear-and he darted
up into the castle

  a sweeping glance revealed no one
only the murky glow of the altar fire
and the wraiths of smoke pluming up-
ward toward the shadowed roof wish-
ing now that he had brought a weapon
from the galley cliff crossed to the
opening in the wall he stood at the
top of the steps listening then cursed
silently as he remembered that he could
hear none but very loud sounds he saw
nothing so he hastened down into the
corridor his steps were swiftly stealthy
as he moved toward corios room

  he was past the first branching pas-
    w t-

sage when a sixth sense warned him of
someones approach he ran swiftly to
the next fork then paused within its
shelter and glanced back saw five red-
cowled figures glide along the tunnel
and vanish up the stairway cliff
frowned with the vampires in the great
hall corio must soon follow leading his
victims to the blood-feast he drew back
deeper into the shadows

  his groping hands touched something
in the dark-round and hard-like a
keg curiously he investigated it was
a keg and there were others a sandy
powder trailed to the floor from a crack
in one of them thoughtfully cliff let it
run through his fingers gunpowder of
course-he had heard corio mention
pirates and their treasure and this had
been their cache of explosive an idea
was forming   

  he looked up to see a shadow pass the
mouth of the tunnel he crept forward
and peered out he saw the blade-hooded
figure of leon corio striding along saw
him enter the room where the passengers
of the ariel lay in a breath cliff was
down the corridor to corios room a
tarnished silver candelabrum shed faint
light through the chamber and by its
flickering glow he searched for vilma
thoroughly painstakingly-futilely

  he stood in the center of the room in
indecision his forehead creased with
anxiety if only he could find her hed
know how to plan he ran his hand
through his hair helplessly then heard
very faintly the luring note of corios
horn she must answer that summons
unless corio had her tied somewhere
his best chance of finding her lay in the
hall above

   on the wall still hung the mate of the
cutlas he had used to free vilma he
wrendied it down and ran out into the
corridor the last of the naked mardiers
was disappearing up the stairway now


weird tales

the hom-note died and he could feel
more than hear the fumbling bass of the
dirge from the depths below him

  he ran the rest of the distance along
the passageway and mounted the steps
two at a stride he looked into the tor-
ture hall as on the previous night
corio stood far back close to the wall
in which cliff crouched the arms of
the master were raised high raised
cliff knew though he could not hear it
in a blasphemous incantation and then
he saw something that sent a crimson
lance of fury crashing through his brain

  vilma stripped like the rest stood
with the other victims at the foot of the
long steps her body gleamed pinkly
in contrast to the pallid drabness of the
half-dead automatons and she held her
head proudly erect but from where he
stood cliff could see the side of her
face and it bore a look of terror

  he could see corios face too and he
was looking at the girl baffled fury
glaring from his eyes-as though she
were there against his will

  cliffs first impulse was to fling him-
self out there with his cutlas and hack a
way to freedom for vilma and himself
but cold reason checked this folly such
a course could end only in death motion-
less he watched the scene before him his
brain frantically seeking a plan with even
a ghost of a chance of succeeding

  the gunpowder there was enough of
die stuff below to blast this entire castle
into the hell where it belonged hastily
he retraced his steps to the tunnel in
which he had found the kegs plucking
the torch from its nidie in the wall as
he passed it he held it high above his
head as he examined the contents of the
broken keg unmistakably gunpowder

  thrusting the cutlas beneath his belt
he clutched a handful of the black dust
then crouching close to the floor he
drew an irregular thread through the

passageway toward the stairs once he
returned for more powder but in a few
minutes the job was done at the foot
of the steps where the trail ended he
touched his torch to the black line and
watched a hissing spark snake its white-
smoked way back toward the powder
kegs an instant he watched it then
sprang up the stairs hed have to move
fast

  with a hideous howl he darted into
the hall his cutlas above his head corio
spun about-and it was his last living act
a single sweep of the great blade sheared
his head from his neck sent it rolling
grotesquely along the floor for three
heart-beats the body stood with a foun-
tain of blood spurting from severed
arteries then it crashed

  coolly cliff leaned over the twitching
cadaver ignoring the bedlam on the
stairs the horde sweeping down toward
him hurling aside the waiting humans
he pried open clutching fingers seized
a twisted silver instrument and raised it
to his lips

the mass of undead were almost
upon him the murky light glinting
on menacing blades when cliff blew the
first note the note of sleep he tried
again hastily and it was the right one

  at the doleful soothing sound the un-
dead halted in their tracks halted-and
melted into nothingness before his eyes

  but now those other five in their robes
of bloody red-they were charging and
even though they were unarmed cliff
felt a stab of fear they possessed
powers beyond the human powers a
mortal could not combat he braced him-
self and waited

  at the bottom of the steps they
stopped ranging in a wide half-circle
the central monster-the master-flung
up his arms in a strangely terrifying ges-
ture and cliff saw his carmine lips move
isle of the undead



jo a chant which he could not hear
something a chilling presence hovered
about him seemed to settle upon him
cloaking him with the might of the devil
himself that unheard incantation con-
tinued and cliff felt a cold rigidity
creeping through every fiber slowly
freezing his limbs into columns of ice

  with a mighty effort of will he flung
himself toward that accursed drinker of
blood-and at that instant a terrific de-
tonation rocked the ancient building and
a cloud of smoke and flame burst from
the opening in the wall cliff was
hurled from his feet rolled over and
over and crashed against the wall by the
awful concussion the cutlas and silver
horn sent whirling through the air

  dizzily he staggered to his feet
crouching defensively sounds came to
him clearly now the explosion must have
jarred the plugs from his ears he
scanned the room saw the unclad hu-
mans scattered everywhere most of them
lying still and unconscious he saw
vilma rising slowly then he looked for
the monsters in red startled he saw
them rushing toward the opening in the
wall to vanish in its smoke-filled inter-
ior why did they- then he knew

down there somewhere were their graves
-graves rent and broken by the explo-
sion-graves threatened by the flames-
and panic had seized the vampires fear
of the death which would result with
exile from their tombs

  unsteadily cliff crossed to vilma she
saw him coming and flung herself sob-
bing into his arms he crushed her lithe
form close-and another explosion more
violent than the first sent a section of
the stone floor leaping upward as though
with life of its own clinging to vilma
cliff managed to maintain his footing
though the floor bucked and heaved a
snapping booming roar-and a great
chasm opened in the floor a breathless

instant-and a segment of the stone
stairs rumbling thunderously dropped
out of sight into a newly formed pit
with it went the blasphemous altar and
its phosphorescent fire

  deafened stunned momentarily
powerless to move cliffs mind groped
for an explanation it seemed incredible
that gunpowder could cause such havoc
and the swaying of the floor continued
the thick stone walls shook alarmingly
suddenly he understood an earthquake
the explosions had jarred the none-too-
stable understrata of rock into spasmodic
motion that must grind everything to
bits the island was doomed and
earth would be better without it

   if only they could reach the ariel first

  new strength flowed through him and
hugging vilma close he staggered
toward the spot where he knew the door
must be somehow he reached it and
reeled down the broken stone steps

  the plain of dead trees swayed like
the deck of a ship in a storm as cliff
started across it a gale had arisen and
swept in from the sea ripping dry
branches from the skeleton growths and
whirling them about like straws yet
somehow cliff readied the crevice in the
rock wall with his burden reached the
deck of the galley crossed it and won
to the safety of the ariel minutes later
with diesel engines purring they crept
out through the narrow channel into the
open sea

ten minutes later the isle of the
undead lay safely behind them
vilma had dressed and now they sat
together in the pilot house cliff had
one arm about her and one hand on
the wheel

  and so the girl was saying while
corio carried you to that terrible old
boat i got loose he hadnt tied me
very tightly and i slipped my hands
 

weird tales

free i had to hide and i could think
of only one place that might be safe
where he wouldnt think to look for me

i	ran down to the room where those-
those others lay i undressed and buried
myself among them it was horrible-
the way they sucked each others
wounds   

  cliff pressed a hand across her lips
 forget that he said almost fiercely
 forget all of it-dyou hear

  she looked up at him and said simply
tll try

  they glanced back toward the black
blotch on the horizon the seismic dis-

turbances continued unabated at that
moment they saw the barrier of rock like
a skull split and sink into the sea be-
yond cleansing tongues of flame licked
the sky they saw a single jagged wall
of the castle still standing one window
glowing in its black expanse like a
square bloody moon against a bloody
sky it crumbled

  they turned away and cliffs arm
circled the girl he loved their lips met

weird tales

ancient pomps and vain and vanished
splendor but the statue of anubis
opener of the way jackal-headed god
of karneter was not alive and those
that had bowed in worship were long
dead death was everywhere it haunted
the shadowy tunnel where the idol stood
hidden away in the mummy-cases and
biding amidst the very dust of the stone
floor death and darkness-darkness
undispelled by light these three thousand
years

  today however light came it was
heralded by a grating clang as the iron
door at the further end of the passage-
way swung open on its rusted hinges
swung open for the first time in thirty
centuries through the opening came
the strange illumination of a torch and
the sudden sound of voices

  there was something indescribably
eery about the event for three thousand
years no light had shone in these blade
and buried vaults for three thousand
years no feet had disturbed the dusty
carpet of their floors for three thousand
years no voice had sent its sound through
the ancient air the last light had come
from a sacred torch in the hand of a
priest of bast the last feet to violate the
dust had been encased in egyptian san-
dals the last voice had spoken a prayer
in the language of the upper nile

  and now an electric torch flooded the
scene with sudden light booted feet
stamped noisily across the floor and an
english voice gave vent to fervent pro-
fanity

  in the torchlight the bearer of the
illumination was revealed he was a tall
thin man with a face as wrinkled as the
papyrus parchment he clutched nervously
in his left hand his white hair sunken
eyes and yellowed skin gave him the
aspect of an old man but the smile upon
his thin lips was full of the triumph of
youth close behind him crowded an-

other a younger replica of the first it
was he who had sworn

  for the love of god father-weve
made it

  yes my boy so we have

   look theres the statue just as the
map showed it

  the two men stepped softly in the
dust-strewn passage and halted directly
in front of the idol sir ronald barton
the bearer of the light held it aloft to
inspect the figure of the god more
dosely peter barton stood at his side
eyes following his fathers gaze

  for a long moment the invaders scru-
tinized the guardian of the tomb they
had violated it was a strange moment
there in the underground burrow a mo-
ment that spanned eternity as the old
confronted the new

   if the idol had been given the gift of
sight it might have contrasted these
white-skinned smartly-accoutered in-
truders with the masked and dusky priests
of olden days but anubis could not
see the god merely grinned in chimeric
glee with stone teeth bared in a cen-
turied smile

  but the two men gazed up at the
eidolon in astonishment and awe the
colossal figure of the jackal-god domi-
nated the dim passage and its weathered
form still held vestiges of imposing
grandeur and inexplicable menace the
sudden influx of outer air from the
opened door had swept the idols body
free of dust and the intruders scrutin-
ized its gleaming form with a certain
vague unease twelve feet tall was
anubis a man-like figure with the dog-
face of a jackal upon massive shoulders
the arms of the statue were held forth
in an attitude of warning as if endeavor-
ing to repel the passage of outsiders
this was peculiar for to all intents and
purposes the guardian figure had nothing
behind it but a narrow niche in the wall
the opener of the way



  there was an air of evil suggestion
about the god however a hint of bestial
humanity in its body which seemed to
hide a secret sentient life the knowing
smile on the carven countenance seemed
cynically alive the eyes though stony
held a strange and disturbing awareness
it was as though the statue were alive
or rather as though it were merely a
stone doak that harbored life

the two explorers sensed this with-
out speaking and for a long minute
they contemplated the opener of the
way uneasily then with a sudden
start the older man resumed his cus-
tomary briskness of manner

  well son lets not stand here gawk-
ing at this thing all day we have plenty
to do yet-the biggest task remains have
you looked at the map

  yes father the younger mans
voice was not nearly as loud or as firm
as sir ronalds he did not like the
mephitic air of the stone passageway
he did not care for the stench that
seemed to spawn in the shadows of the
corners he was acutely aware of the
fact that he and his father were in a
hidden tomb seven hundred feet below
the desert sands a secret tomb that had
lain unopened for thirty creeping cen-
turies and he could not help but re-
member the curse

  for there was a curse on the place
indeed it was that whidi had led to
its discovery

  sir ronald had found it in the exca-
vation of the ninth pyramid the mol der-
ing papyrus parchment which held the
key to a secret way how he had
smuggled it past the heads of the expe-
dition nobody can say but he had man-
aged the task somehow

  after all he was not wholly to be
blamed though the theft of expedition-
ary trophies is a serious offense but for

twenty years sir ronald barton had
combed the deserts uncovered sacred
relics deciphered hieroglyphics and dis-
interred mummies statues ancient furni-
ture or precious stones he had un-
earthed untold wealth and incredibly val-
uable manuscripts for his government
yet he was still a poor man and had
never been rewarded by becoming head
of an expedition of his own who can
blame him if he took that one misstep
which he knew would lead him to fame
and fortune at last

  besides he was getting old and after
a score of years in egypt all archeologists
are a little mad there is something
about the sullen sun overhead that
paralyzes the brains of men as they fer-
ret in the sand digging in unhallowed
ruins something about the damp dark
stillness underground in temple vaults
that chills the soul it is not good to
look upon the old gods in the places
where they still rule for cat-headed
bubastis serpented set and evil amon-
ra frown down as sullen guardians in
the purple pylons before the pyramids
over all is an air of forbidden things
long dead and it creeps into the blood
sir ronald had dabbled in sorcery a
bit so perhaps it affected him more
strongly than the rest at any rate he
stole the pardiment

  it had been penned by a priest of
ancient egypt but the priest had not
been a holy man no man could write
as he had written without violating his
vows it was a dreadful thing that man-
uscript steeped in sorcery and hideous
with half-hinted horrors

  the enchanter who had written it al-
luded to gods far older than those he
worshipped there was mention of the
demon messenger and the black
temple coupled with the secret myth
and legend-cycles of pre-adamite days
for just as the christian religion has its


weird tales

black mass just as every sect has its hid-
den devil-worship the egyptians knew
their own darker gods

  the names of these accursed ones were
set forth together with the orisons neces-
sary for their invocation shocking and
blasphemous statements abounded in the
text threats against the reigning religion
and terrible curses upon the people who
upheld it perhaps that is why sir ron-
ald found it buried with the mummy of
the priest-its discoverers had not dared
to destroy it because of the doom which
might befall them they had their way
of vengeance though because the
mummy of the priest was found without
arms legs or eyes and these were not
lost through decay

sir ronald though he found the
above-mentioned portions of the
parchment intensely interesting was
much more impressed by the last page
it was here that the sacrilegious one told
of the tomb of his master who ruled
the dark cult of the day there were a
map a chart and certain directions
these had not been written in egyptian
but in the cuneiform chirography of
chaldea doubtless that is why the old
avenging priests had not sought out the
spot for themselves to destroy it they
were probably unfamiliar with the lan-
guage unless they were kept away by
fear of the curse

  peter barton still remembered that
night in cairo when he and his father
had first read it in translation he re-
called the avid gleam in sir ronalds
glittering eyes the tremulous depth in
his guttural voice

  and as the maps direct there you
shall find the tomb of the master who
lies with his acolytes and all his treasure

  sir ronalds voice nearly broke with
excitement as he pronounced this last
word

  and at the entrance upon the night
that the dog-star is ascendant yon must
give up three jackals upon an altar in
sacrifice and with the blood bestrew the
sands about the opening then the bats
shall descend that they may have feast-
ing and carry their glad tidings of
blood to father set in the underworld

  superstitious rigmarole young
peter had exclaimed

  dont scoff son sir ronald ad-
vised i could give you reasons for
what it says above and make you under-
stand but i am afraid that the truth
would disturb you unnecessarily

  peter had stayed silent while his
father read on

  upon descending into the outer pas-
sage you will find the door set with the
symbol of the master who waits within
grasp the symbol by the seventh tongue
in the seventh head and with a knife
remove it then shall the barrier give
way and the gate to the tomb be yours
thirty and three are the steps along the
inner passage and there stands the statue
of anubis opener of the way

  anubis but isnt he a regular
egyptian deity-a recognized one peter
broke in

  his father answered from the manu-
script itself

  for lord anubis holds the keys to
life and death he guards cryptic kar-
neter and none shall pass the veil
without consent some there are who
deem the jackal-god to be a friend of
those who rule but he is not anubis
stands in shadows for he is the keeper
of mysteries in olden days for which
there is no number it is written that lord
anubis revealed himself to men and he
who then was master fashioned the first
image of the god in his true likeness
such is the image that you will find at
the end of the inner passageway-the
the opener of the way



first true image of the opener of the
way

  astounding peter had muttered
think what it means if this is true
imagine finding the original statue of
the god

  his father merely smiled a trifle
wanly peter thought

  there are ways in which the first
image differs from the rest said the
manuscript these ways are not good
for men to know so the first likeness was
hidden by the masters through the ages
and worshipped according to its de-
mands but now that our enemies-may
their souls and vitals rot-have dared
profane the rites the master saw fit to
hide the image and bury it with him
when he died

  sir ronalds voice quivered as he read
the next few lines

  but anubis does not stand at the
head of the inner passage for this reason
alone he is truly called the opener of
the way and without his help none
may pass to the tomb within

  here the older man stopped com-
pletely for a long moment

  whats the matter inquired peter
impatiently i suppose theres another
silly ritual involving the statue of the
god eh

  his father did not answer but read on
to himself silently- peter noticed that
sir ronalds hands trembled as he held
the parchment and when the older man
looked up at last his face was very pale

  yes my boy he replied huskily
thats what it is-another silly ritual
but no need to bother about it until we
get to the place itself

  you mean to go there-discover the
spot asked the young man eagerly

  i must go there sir ronalds tone
was constrained he glanced again at
the last portion of the parchment

  but beware for those who do not

believe shall die pass lord anubis
though they may still he shall know and
not permit of their return unto the world
of men for the eidolon of anubis is
a very strange one indeed and holds a
secret soul

  the old archeologist blurted out these
last words very quickly and immediately
folded up the parchment again after
that he had deliberately turned the talk
to practical affairs as if seeking to forget
what he had read

the next weeks were spent in prepa-
ration for the trip to the south and
sir ronald seemed to avoid his son
except when it was necessary to converse
with him on matters pertaining directly
to the expeditionary affairs

  but peter had not forgotten he
wondered what it was his father had
read silently that secret ritual which
would enable one to pass beyond the
opener of the way why had his
father blanched and trembled then
quickly changed the subject to saner
things why had he guarded the parch-
ment so closely and just what was the
nature of the curse the manuscript
mentioned at the last

  peter pondered these questions a great
deal but he had gradually dispelled his
stronger fears because of the necessary
preoccupation with technical details
which the organizing of their expedi-
tion subsequently entailed not until he
and his father were actually in the desert
did his misgivings return but then they
plagued him mightily

  there is an air of eon-spawned anti-
quity about the desert a certain aura of
the ancient which makes one feel that
the trivial triumphs of man are as fleet-
ing and quickly obscured as his foot-
prints in the shifting sand in such
places there descends upon the soul a
sphinx-like brooding and somber solilo-


weird tales

quies rise unrepressed to rule the mind

  young peter had been affected by the
spell of the silent sands he tried to
remember some of the things his father
had once told him concerning egyptian
sorcery and the miraculous magic of the
high priests legends of tombs and
underground horrors took on a new
reality here in the place of their birth
peter barton knew personally many men
who had believed in the potency of
curses and some of them had died
strangely there was the tut-ankh-
ahmen affair and the paut temple scan-
dal and the terrible rumors concerning
the end of that unsavory adventurer
doctor stugatche at night under the
spying stars he would recall these and
similar tales then shudder anew at the
thought of what might lie before him

when sir ronald had made camp
at the spot designated by the map
there had been new and more concrete
terrors

  that first night sir ronald had gone
off alone into the hills behind the tents
he bore with him a white goat and a
sharp knife his son following had
come upon the old man after a deed had
been done so that the sand had been
given to drink the goats blood shone
horribly in the moonlight and there was
a red glare of corresponding violence in
the slayers eyes peter had not made his
presence known for he did not deem it
wise to interrupt his father while the old
man was muttering those outlandish
egyptian phrases to a mocking moon

  indeed peter was more than a little
afraid of sir ronald else he would have
attempted to dissuade him from continu-
ing the expedition but there was some-
thing in sir ronalds manner which
hinted at a mad unthwartable determi-
nation it was that which made peter
keep silent that which held him from

bluntly asking his father the true details
about the parchments mysterious
curse

  the day after the peculiar incident in
the midnight hills sir ronald after
consulting certain zodiacal charts an-
nounced that the digging would start
carefully eyes on the map he measured
his paces to an exact spot in the sands
and ordered the men to work by sun-
down a ten-foot shaft yawned like a great
wound in the earth and excited natives
proclaimed the presence of a door be-
neath

  sir ronald rewarded them with spirits
sufficient to plunge them all into a coma-
tose slumber long before midnight then
he opened the crates where the jackals
were kept peter assisted him in this
task but reluctantly

  for peter remembering the instruc-
tions in the parchment knew why his
father had taken the three beasts along
knew why he had withheld digging un-
til a night when canis was ascendant
realized too that the stuporous sleep of
the men was by no means accidental the
manuscript specified that the blood of
three jackals should be spilled in ac-
cordance with the old rites of propitia-
tion so sir ronald took the creatures
over to a spot among the stones before
the excavation and peter watched silently
from afar

  he saw a gleaming blade rise and
descend thrice in the mad moonlight
heard three keening cries well out in the
desert air and the wind bore its scented
baptism of blood then with uncanny
swiftness there came a rustling from
above and the moon was blotted out by
a brood of bats their beating wings
coursed doud-like over its phosphores-
cent face and with eager squeakings the
charnel swarm descended to batten on
the bloody bodies of the beasts

  that terrible scurrying and tittering
the opener of the way



coupled with a gust of ghoulish stench
made peter reel with uncontrollable nau-
sea he had turned hastily away but not
before his eyes were assailed by the sight
of sir ronald barton crouching obscenely
over the jackals his face and body nearly
obscured by a swarm of circling bats
on his face there was a hideous smile
and with his knife he was digging
chunks of raw flesh from the carcasses
beneath him-chunks of raw flesh which
he held in outstretched hands feeding
the scavenger bats as they flew and
when he bent and nuzzled at one of the
bodies with his own teeth peter ran sob-
bing to his tent only to spend the rest
of the night in torment-torpid dreams
the next morning he noticed that his
fathers lips were unnaturally red   



that day they had descended to the
outer door neither peter nor his
father spoke of what had occurred the
previous night and the men ascribed
their sleep to the spirits alone evidently
sir ronald had disposed of the fleshy
remnants and bones of his victims before
retiring for there was now nought vis-
ible around the stones of the opening
and the terrible clinging odor of decay
might very well be ascribed to the
noisome emanations of the pit below

  by this time peter whose nerves were
near the breaking-point was too much
afraid of his father to demur when
ordered to descend to the floor of the
excavation undoubtedly the elder man
was in the grip of a severe aberration
but peter who really loved his father
thought it advisable not to provoke him
by refusing to obey he did not like the
idea of going down into that chasm for
the seeping smell was distressingly re-
pulsive but the stench below was a
thousand times more bearable than the

sight of the dark door through which it
had slithered

  this evidently was the door to the
outer passageway that the manuscript
had mentioned all at once peter knew
what was meant by the allusion to the
seventh tongue in the seventh head
and wished that the meaning had re-
mained for ever obscured from his brain
for the door was set with a silver
symbol framed in the familiar ideog-
raphy of egyptological lore this cen-
tral symbol consisted of the heads of the
seven principal egyptian gods-osiris
isis ra bast thoth set and anubis
but the horror lay in the fact that all
seven heads protruded from a common
body and it was not the body of any
god heretofore known in myth it was
not anthropomorphic that figure it held
nothing that aped the human form and
peter could recall no parallel in all the
egyptian cosmology or pantheon which
could be remotely construed to resemble
this utterly alien horror

  the quixotic abhorrency it induced
cannot be ascribed to anything which may
be put into words the sight of it seemed
to send little tentacles of terror through
peters eyes tiny tentacles that took root
in his brain to drain it dry of all feeling
save frantic fear part of this may have
been due to the fact that the body ap-
peared to be constantly changing
melting that is from one indescribable
shape to another when viewed from a
certain angle the form was that of a
medusa-like mass of serpents a second
gaze revealed thar the thing was a glisten-
ing array of vampiric flowers with gelid
protoplasmic petals that seemed to
weave in blob-like thirst for blood a
third scrutiny made it appear that the
formless mass was nothing but a chaotic
jumble of silver skulls at another time
it seemed to hold a ccrtain hidden pattern
of the cosmos-stars and planets so com-


weird tales

pressed as to hint at the enormity of all
space beyond

  what devilish craft could produce
such a baffling nightmare composite peter
could not say and he did not like to
imagine that the insane thing was the
pattern of any human artist he fancied
that there was some sinister implication
of allegorical significance about the door
that the heads set on the background of
that baffling body were somehow sym-
bolic of a secret horror which rules be-
hind all human gods but the more he
looked the more his mind became ab-
sorbed in the intricate silvery maze of
design it was compelling hypnotic
glimpsing it was like pondering upon the
meaning of life-pondering in that
awful way that drives philosophers mad

  from this beguilement peter was
roughly awakened by his fathers voice
he had been very curt and abrupt all
morning but now his words were fraught
with an unmistakable eagerness

   its the place all right-the door of
the parchment now i know what prinn
must have meant in his chapter on the
saracenic rituals the part where he spoke
of the symbols on the gate we must
photograph this after we finish i hope
we can move it later if the natives dont
object

  there was a hidden relish in his words
which peter disliked and almost feared
he became suddenly aware of how little
he really knew about his father and his
secret studies of recent years recalled re-
luctantly certain guarded tomes he had
glimpsed in the library at cairo and
last night his father had been out there
with the bats like some mad old priest
did he really believe such nonsense or
did he know it was the truth

  now the old mans voice was tri-
umphant  have the knife stand
back

  with fearful fascinated eyes peter

saw his father insert the tip of the knife
under the seventh head-that of anubis
steel grated on silver then the latter
gave as the dog-like head slowly turned
as though actuated by a hidden pivot the
door swung open with a brazen clangor
that echoed and re-echoed through the
musty depths beyond

  and musty those depths proved to be
a noxious acrid scent burst forth from
its long imprisonment a charnel fetor
it was not the natron or spice-laden
miasma common to most tombs rather
it held the concentrated essence of death
itself-mildewed bones putrefied flesh
and crumbled dust

oncb the first strengdi of the gaseous
vapor had abated sir ronald im-
mediately stepped inside he was fol-
lowed though much less quickly by his
son the thirty-and-three sloping steps
along the corridor were traversed as the
manuscript had foretold then lantern
in hand the old man was confronted by
the enigmatic eidolon of anubis

  after that first dismaying scrutiny dur-
ing which peter had uneasily recalled
these memories of preceding incidents
sir ronald interrupted his sons revery
and spoke he whispered there before
the giant statue of the god that seemed
to frown down upon the puniness of
men with baleful conscious eyes some
trick of the lantern-light seemed to
change the contours of that stone coun-
tenance its chiseled grin was transformed
into a gloating leer of mirthless menace
yet the grim apprehension this aroused
in peter was soon overpowered by more
acute fright when he heard his fathers
words

  listen boy i did not tell you all
that the parchment revealed to me that
night you remember there was a part
i read only to myself well i had rea-
sons for not letting you know the rest
the opener of the way



then you would not have understood
and probably would have refused to come
here with me i needed you too much to
risk that

  you dont know what this moment
means to me my son for years ive
worked and studied in secret over things
which others scoff at as superstitious
fancies i believed however and i have
learned there are always lurking truths
behind every forgotten religion distorted
facts which can be rationalized into new
concepts of reality ive been on the
trail of something like this for a long
time-i knew that if i could discover a
tomb like this it must surely contain
proofs which would convince the world
there are probably mummies within
the bodies of this cults secret leaders
thats not what im after though its
the knowledge thats buried with them
the papyrus manuscripts that hold for-
bidden secrets-wisdom the world has
never known wisdom-and power

  sir ronalds voice was shrill with un-
natural excitement

  power i have read about the inner
circles of the black temple and the cult
that was ruled by those designated as
masters in this parchment they were
not ordinary priests of magic they had
traffickings with entities from outside
human spheres their curses were feared
and their wishes respected why be-
cause of what they knew i tell you in
this tomb we may find secrets that can
give us mastery over half the world
death-rays and insidious poisons old
books and potent spells whose efficacy
may bring a renascence of primal gods
again think of it one could control
governments rule kingdoms destroy
enemies with that knowledge and there
will be jewels wealth and riches un-
dreamt of the treasure of a thousand
thrones

  he is quite mad peter thought for

a moment he entertained a frantic im-
pulse to turn and run back through the
corridor he wanted to see the sanity of
a sun overhead and feel a breath of air
on his brow that was not dust-polluted
by dead centuries but the old man
grasped him by the shoulders as he
mumbled on and peter was forced to
remain

  you dont understand i see per-
haps its for the best but no matter i
know what im about you will too
after i do what is necessary i must tell
you now what the parchment said that
portion of it which i did not read aloud

  some inner instinct screamed silent
warnings in peters brain he must get
away-he must but his fathers grip
was firm though his voice trembled

  the part i refer to is that which tells
one how to get past this statue and into
the tomb itself no nothing can be dis-
covered by looking at the thing theres
no secret passage behind it no levers con-
cealed in the body of the god the
master and his acolytes were cleverer
than that mechanical means are of no
avail-theres only one way to enter into
the tomb beyond and that is through
the body of the god itself

  peter gazed again into the mask-like
countenance of anubis the jackal-face
was contorted in cunning comprehen-
sion-or was it only a trick of the light
his father hurried on

  that sounds queer but its the truth
you remember what the parchment said
about this statue being the first one-
different from the rest how it empha-
sized the fact that anubis is the opener
of the way and hinted at its secret soul
well the next lines explained that it
seems that the figure can turn upon a
pivot and open a space behind it into the
tomb but only when the idol is animated
by a human consciousness

  they were all mad peter knew he


weird tales

his father the old priests and the statue
itself all insane entities in a world of
chaos

  that means only one thing i must
hypnotize myself by gazing at the god
hypnotize myself until my soul enters
its body and opens the way beyond
peters blood was frozen ice in his
veins

  its not so bizarre a conception at
that the yogis believe that in their
trances they incarnate themselves with
the godhead the self-hypnotic state is a
religious manifestation among all races
and mesmerism is a scientific truth a
truth known and practised thousands of
years before psychology was postulated
as an organized study these priests evi-
dently knew the principle so that is
what i must do-hypnotize myself so
that my soul or consciousness enters the
image then i shall be able to open
the tomb behind

  but the curse peter muttered find-
ing his voice at last you know what
it says about a curse on unbelievers-
something about lord anubis being a
guardian as well as an opener of the
way what about that

  sheer humbug sir ronalds tone
was fanatically firm that was merely
inserted to frighten off tomb-looters at
any rate i must risk it all you need do
is wait once i pass into a trance the
statue will move and the passage be-
yond will be disclosed enter it immedi-
ately then give my body a good shake
to break the coma and ill be all right
again

there was in his fathers words an
authority which could not be denied
so peter held the lantern aloft and al-
lowed its beams to play over the face
of anubis he stood in silence while his
father focussed his gaze upon the jackal
eyes-those stony staring eyes that had

so disturbed them with hints of a secret
life

  it was a terrible tableau the mo men
the twelve-foot god confronting each
other in a black vault beneath the earth

  sir ronalds lips moved in fragments
of ancient egyptian prayers his eyes
were fixed upon a nimbus of light that
had settled about the canine forehead
gradually his stare became glassy nicta-
tion ceased and the pupils glowed with a
peculiar nyctaloptic fire the mans body
sagged visibly as if it were being vam-
pirically drained of all life

  then to peters horror a pallor over-
spread his fathers face and he sank
down silently upon the stone floor but
his eyes never left those of the idol
peters left arm which held the lantern
aloft was seized with a spasmodic con-
vulsion of utter fright minutes sped
away in silence time has no meaning
in a place of death

  peter could not think he had seen
his father practise self-hypnosis before
with mirrors and lights he knew it was
perfectly harmless in the hands of a
skilled adept but this was different
could he enter the body of an egyptian
god and if he did-what of the curse
these two questions reverberated like
tiny voices somewhere in his being but
they were engulfed by overpowering
fear

  this fear rose to a mad crescendo as
peter saw the change occur all at once
his fathers eyes flickered like dying fires
and consciousness went out but the eyes
of the god-the eyes of anubis were no
longer stone

  the cyclopean statue was alive

  his father had been right he had
done it-hypnotized his consciousness
into the body of the idol peter gasped
as a sudden thought slithered into his
brain if his fathers theory had been
correct so far then what about the rest
the opener of the way



he had said that once inside the figure
his soul would direct it to open the way
but nothing was happening what was
wrong

  in panic peter bent down and exam-
ined the body of his father it was limp
cold and lifeless sir ronald was dead

  unbidden peter remembered the
parchments cryptic warnings

  those who do not believe shall die
pass lord anubis though they may still
he shall know and not permit of their
return unto the world of men for the
eidolon of anubis is strange indeed and
holds a secret soul

  a secret soul peter terror throbbing
in his temples raised the lantern aloft
and looked once more into the gods
face again he saw that the stony snarl-
ing mask of anubis held living eyes

  they glittered bestially knowingly
evilly and peter seeing them went
berserk he did not-could not-think
all he knew was that his father was
dead and this statue had somehow killed
him and come alive

  so peter barton suddenly rushed for-
ward screaming hoarsely and began to
beat upon the stone idol with futile fists
his bleeding lacerated knuckles clawed
at the cold legs but anubis did not stir
yet his eyes still held their awful life

  the man cursed in sheer delirium
babbling in a tortured voice as he started
to climb up to that mocking face he
must know what lay behind that gaze
see the thing and destroy its unnatural
life as he climbed he sobbed his
fathers name in agony

  how long it took him to reach the top
he never knew the last minutes were
merely a red blur of nightmare frenzy
when he recovered his senses he was
clinging precariously to the statues neck
his feet braced on the belly of the image
and he was still staring into those dread-
ful living eyes

  but even as he gazed the whole face
was twisting into a sudden ghastly life
the lips drew back into a cavern of
cackling mirth and the fangs of anubis
were bared in terrible avid lust

  the arms of the god crushed him in
a stone embrace the claw-like fingers
tightened about his quivering constricted
throat the gaping muzzle ravened as
stone teeth sank jackal-like into his neck
thus he met his doom-but it was a
welcome doom after that final moment
of revelation

the natives found peters bloodless
body lying crushed and crumpled
at the idols feet lying before the statue
of anubis like a sacrifice of olden days
his father was beside him and he too
was dead

  they did not linger there in the for-
bidden forgotten fastness of that ancient
crypt nor attempt to enter into the tomb
behind instead they reclosed the doors
and returned home there they said that
the old and young effendi had killed
themselves and that is not surprizing
there were really no other indications for
them to go by the statue of anubis
stood once more serene in the shadows
still grimly guarding the secret vaults
beyond and there was no longer any
hint of life in its eyes

  and so there is none who knows
what peter barton knew just before he
died none to know that as peter went
down into death he stared upward and
beheld the revelation which made that
death a welcome deliverance

  for peter learned what animated the
body of the god knew what lived within
it in a dreadful distorted way knew
what was being forced to kill him be-
cause as he died he gazed at last into
the living stone face of anubis-the
living stone face that held his fathers
tortured eyes


weird tales

burning

by mary elizabeth counselman

   they burned a witch in bingham square
     last friday afternoon

   the faggot-smoke was blacker than
     the shadows on the moon

    the licking flames were strangely green
     like fox-fire on the fen   

   and she who cursed the godly folk
     will never curse again

   they burned a witch in bingham square
     before the village gate

    a huswife raised a skinny hand
     to damn her tense with hate

   a huckster threw a jagged stone-

     her pallid cheek ran red   

   but there was something scornful in
     the way she held her head

   they burned a witch in bingham square
     her eyes were terror-wild

    she was a slight a comely maid

      no taller than a child

they bound her fast against the stake
and laughed to see her fear   

    her red lips muttered secret words
     that no one dared to hear

   they burned a witch in bingham square-
     but ere she swooned with pain

   and ere her bones were sodden ash
     beneath the sudden rain

she set her mark upon that throng   

     for time can not erase

    the echo of her anguished cries

     the memory of her face

ost door

 by dorothy quick

  ran alluring but deadly horror out of past centuries menaced the life of the

  young american-a fascinating tale of a strange and eery love

i have often wondered whether i
would have urged wrexler to come
with me if i had known what rouge-
mont would do to him i think-looking
back-that even if i could have
glimpsed the future i would have acted
w t-

in the same way and that i would have
brought him to rougemont to fulfill his
destiny

  as the boat cut its swift way through
the waters on its journey to france i had
no thought of this nor had wrexler

                                  


weird tales

he was happier than i had ever seen
him he had never been abroad before
and the boat was a source of wonder and
enjoyment to him

  i myself was full of an eager antici-
pation of happy months to come it
hardly seemed possible that only a week
had elapsed since i received the cable
that had made such a change in my
fortunes

   your father died yesterday you are sole heir
provided you comply with conditions of his will
the principal one being that you spend six
months of each year at rougemont if satisfac-
tory come at once

  it was signed by my fathers lawyer

  i had no sorrow over my fathers
passing except a deep regret that we
could not have known the true relation-
ship of father and son at the death of
my mother my father had grown bitter
and refused to see the innocent cause of
her untimely passing as a baby i had
been brought up in the lodge of rouge-
mont my fathers magnificent chateau
near vichy when i reached the age of
four i had been sent away to boarding-
school after that my life had been a
succession of schools first in france the
adopted land of my father then england
and finally st pauls in america

  in all justice to my parent i must
admit he gave me every advantage except
the affection i would have cherished
by his own wish i had never seen him
in life nor would i see him in death for
a later cable advised me that the funeral
was over and his body already at rest in
the beautiful gothic mausoleum he had
had built in his lifetime after the man-
ner of the ancients

  he had left me everything with only
two injunctions that a certain sum of
money be set aside to keep the chateau
always in its present condition and that
i should spend at least half my time in
it and my children after me-a condi-

tion i was only too pleased to accept all
my life i had longed for a home

  i cabled at once that i would sail a
return cable brought me the news that i
had unlimited funds to draw upon it
was then that i urged wrexler to come
with me

wrexler and i had been friends
since the day when two lonely boys
had been put by chance into the same
room at school we were so utterly un-
like it was perhaps the difference be-
tween us that held us together through
the years at st pauls and later at
princeton gordon wrexler had always
been at the head of his class whereas i
inevitably tagged along at the bottom
the contrast between us was expressed
not only in the color of our hair and
eyes but also in our dispositions my
greatest gift from fate was a sense of
humor and i suppose it was this quality
of mine that particularly appealed to
wrexler it seems as though i was the
only one who could lift him out of the
despondency into which he often
plunged as the years passed and his
tendency to depression intensified he
came to depend more and more upon me
and we grew closer together

  strangely enough the whiteness of his
face and the gloom that exuded from
him did not detract from his good looks
it only added to them for the translu-
cence of his skin made the thick black
hair that lay close to his head all the
darker while at the same time it brought
out the deep black of his eyes and the
firm cut of his lips

  the night before we landed we were
standing on deck at the rail looking over
the side straining our eyes for the first
glimpse of the lights of cherbourg and
wrexler spoke of himself for the first
time since we had left new york

  you know jim for perhaps the onlg
the lost door



time in my life i feel at peace as though
something that i should have done long
ago has been at last accomplished

  he was so solemn that i laughed a
little he stopped me suddenly its
true-ive always felt an urge within me
a blinding force pushing me toward
something that is waiting for me where
i do not know what i have no idea for
the first time its gone-that nameless
urge that i knew not how to satisfy and
i feel that the calls being answered
with the usual inanity of people at a
loss for words i said the first thing that
came into my mind perhaps rouge-
mont has been calling you

  youve no idea what a relief it is
he continued not to feel constantly
pulled with no way of knowing toward
what or how to go about answering the
summons i have often thought that i
should take my life-that that was what

was meant- his voice trailed off

  this time i was not at a loss for
words i started to read him a lecture
that would have done credit to martin
luther or john knox at the end of my
harangue wrexler laughed a rare thing
for him and put his arm through mine

  all thats gone now didnt i tell
you that at last in some strange way i am
at peace

rougemonts towers were visible
- long before we reached the great
iron gates that had to be swung open to
let us pass for miles the great edifice
dominated the landscape the huge
building had a soft reddish tinge from
which i supposed it derived its name--
red mountain it was a fairy-tale palace
perched on a mountain top a great
thrill went through me as i realized that
this beautiful chateau was mine and as
we drove through the gates up the wind-
ing road through my own forest the
pride of possession swelled up in me and

for the first time i began to understand
why my father had never put his foot
outside the great gates and the high wall
that enclosed the acres that now belonged
to me

  as we drove on up the winding nar-
row road over the drawbridge that
spanned the moat into the courtyard i
understood more and more here was
everything beauty such as i had never
dreamed forests stocked with game
running brooks full of fish a lake and
farther off a farm-i could glimpse its
thatched roofs-to supply our wants
rougcmont was a world in itself

  the high carved door was swung open
as wrexler and i got out of the car
monsieur de carrier my fathers lawyer
advanced to meet us a friendly smile on
his santa claus countenance i shook
hands introduced wrexler as a very
good friend who is going to stay with
me

  monsieur carriers face fell clearly
wrexlers being with me was a disap-
pointment nevertheless he greeted him
politely as he ushered us in

  that moment rougemont took me to
its heart and won me for its own

  imagine amboise or any of the great
french chateaux suddenly restored to
itself as it was in the days of the medici
and you have a small idea of rougemont
for we had stepped out of the present
into the past carrier wrexler and i
were anachronisms everything else was
in keeping with the dead centuries even
the servants were in doublet and hose of
a sort of cerulean blue with great slashes
puffed with crimson silk

  i think i gasped at any rate mon-
sieur carrier saw my astonishment it
is your fathers will my boy he always
kept it so and wore the costume of
former days himself he greatly ad-
mired the first francis in your rooms
you will find costumes prepared for you


weird tales

for the last six months of his life he
was making ready for his son there
was an odd sort of pride in carriers
voice

  i remembered now that my father had
written for my measurements i had
thought he meant to make me a present
but when time passed and i heard
nothing the incident had slipped from
my mind i looked at wrexler expect-
ing to see some sign of amusement on
his face but he stood quietly looking at
the tapestry that hung half-way up the
grand stairway there was a dreamy
far-away expression in his eyes

  may i speak before your friend
carrier asked

  i nodded the servants had already
disappeared with our luggage i threw
myself down on a long low bench and
carrier sat opposite me

  you understood the terms of your
fathers will of course carrier began
that you must live here six months
but you did not know that you must live
here as he did in the past if you do
not then rougemont goes to your
fathers steward with the same condi-
tions-to be kept always as it is with
only a small sum set aside for you

  i said nothing driving along the road
from paris it would have seemed fan-
tastic but here-under the spell of
rougemont-it seemed as though any-
thing else would be impossible

carrier went on you will be grand
seigneur--lord of the manor in
the old style you may have your guests
if you like but they too must conform
with the rules here he glanced at
wrexler who still stood as though he
were in a trance the other six months
you are free to do as you please spend
what you like of the money not needed
for rougemont-that is if you want to
go anywhere else

  evidently he had finished his speech
at the time i did not recognize the
significance of his last words i am will-
ing to submit to the conditions only-
a sudden thought struck me-i dont
want to lose all touch with the outside
world can i go to vichy-to get papers
and so forth i dont suppose they had
papers in francis firsts time

  monsieur de carrier smiled my dear
boy your father didnt wish to make a
prisoner of you you may go to vichy
if you like but you must not be away
from rougemont more than twenty-four
consecutive hours during the six months
you are in residence

  so far as the papers etc are con-
cerned they will be at the lodge there
is also a telephone and your own clothes
will be kept there after tonight
nothing of  must come within these
halls but you are free to go to the lodge
any time you want to you can get in
touch with me also if you desire further
information de lacy the steward will
look out for you he knows your fathers
ways now permit me to congratulate
you and say au re voir my young friend
monsieur de carrier got up on his
stubby fat legs made a little bow to
me another to wrexler which went
unheeded

  i too arose it will seem strange
but ill do my best

  lone other thing monsieur de car-
rier was all of a sudden very grave in
two weeks time you will be given a
key it unlocks a casket you will find in
the library in it you will find a message
from your father adieu my boy i wish
you well

  with a click of the heels and a friendly
smile he was gone

  i turned to wrexler what do you
think of it i asked

  wrexler did not answer he still
stood gazing up at the stairway the
the lost door



wide marble steps curved upward along
the sides the intricate carving was beau-
tiful in its lacy delicateness

  at that moment however i was
alarmed for my friend his attitude was
rigid and his eyes were glassy i put my
hand on his shoulder wrexler

my action galvanized him to life
another minute and she would have
reached the last step now she is gone
this was madness there had been
no one there i said as much

  wrexler turned and faced me but
there was he said eagerly the most
beautiful girl i have ever seen all done
up in some old costume great wide
skirts little waist and a high lace collar
she had bronze curls great blue eyes and
the loveliest face i saw her immediately
we came in she looked at both of us
but she smiled at me

  i was in a quandary until now i had
not given the staircase more than a per-
functory glance for all i knew she
might have been one of the servants
peeping to see her new master to
wrexler impressionable strange crea-
ture that he was the one glance might
have so registered on his mind that he
kept on seeing her for certainly she had
not been there when i looked it seemed
best to make light of the whole matter

  anyway shes gone now at least i
can explain the costume i take it you
didnt hear carriers announcements
wrexler shook his head i proceeded
to enlighten him

  instead of teasing me about the strange
conditions my fathers will had imposed
upon me he was enthusiastic about the
idea its the one period in history
that has always interested me jim
were in luck imagine stepping back
into medici france for six months shut-
ting out the world who knows but
that catherine herself may have stayed
here or marguerite de valois--the

marguerite of marguerites beautiful
but no more beautiful than that girl
on the stairs i can hardly wait to see her
again

   i heartily hoped that he would see her
and that she was not entirely a creature of
his imagination if she was real i too
was eager to meet her

  wrexler interrupted my thoughts

  i feel as though i had come home
he said im crazy to explore lets go
shed these ugly things and begin to really
live why its been this ive been wait-
ing for its lucky were the same size

out of his irrelevance i gathered the
trend of his thought i wonder
where we go i began

  almost as though he had heard my
words a tall commanding figure stepped
into the hall he was attired richly in
damask of a lovely soft blue with the
same slashes of crimson that the servant
livery had shown but in this case of finer
material he was a handsome man of
about thirty-four his beard was pointed
and he had a small mustache his long
legs were encased in silken hose and he
wore a dagger thrust through his belt

  de lacy at your service my lord
he announced as he made a deep bow

  i extended my hand somewhat at a
loss to know how to greet my fathers
steward who was clearly a man of some
importance and who but for me would
be owner of rougemont

  instead of shaking hands he dropped
on one knee and kissed my hand-a pro-
ceeding which embarrassed me very
much

  on my motioning him to rise he did
so with a lithe grace t suppose you
want to change your strange clothes my
lord and see your quarters

  i nodded and introduced wrexler de
lacy bowed monsieur wrexler would
like to be near you then he added


weird tales

we have some twenty or thirty suites
my lord

  wrexler said he would prefer to be
close at hand and together we followed
de lacy up the marble stairway into a
new world

  wrexler was at ease immediately in
his doublet and hose the rich em-
broidered garments seemed to suit him
as modem clothes never did he looked
handsomer than ever he also told me
that the costume of the medici was
becoming to me and truly when i caught
a glimpse of myself mirrored in the pond
-for the chateau did not possess a
large mirror-i was not ill pleased with
the result but by the end of the week
i still felt strange in my new attire
whereas wrexler from the beginning
wore his as if to the manor born

  but i anticipate that first night we
donned two of the outfits which the valet
whom de lacy introduced to me had put
out our own clothes disappeared and
much to my annoyance with them my
cigarettes

we ate dinner in state upon a raised
dais at one end of a great hall
at either side below us were long nar-
row tables filled with people dressed
also in keeping with the period they
made a wonderful picture and comprised
i supposed my court or retinue de lacy
presented me to them with a flourish
and they all filed by and kissed my hand
then went to their places

  when wrexler and i were seated
they too sat down when i began to
talk they filled the hall with gay chat-
tering from a minstrel gallery at the
other end of the room came soft strains
of music

  de lacy stood behind me pouring
my wine one thing i noticed was that
in the whole room-and there must have
ben two hundred people at least-there

were no older men or women in fact
de lacy was the oldest of the lot the
others ranged from about sixteen to
thirty

  how did my father get all these
people together i asked de lacy

  most of them my lord were bom
at rougemont still others were adopted
and brought here almost as soon as they
were bom none of us has ever been
outside rougemont gates de lacy was
quite matter-of-fact as he made his
statement

  wrexler was searching the hall with
his eyes as he listened to my steward
and you i looked at de lacy

  i too my lord know nothing of
your outside world nor do i want to
why should i who am happy here my
family live down at the farm but his
highness your father became interested
in me he brought me into the chateau
had me educated and looked after me
himself eventually he made me steward
of rougemont it is a great honor he
conferred upon me and i shall do my
best to help you my lord

  of a sudden i saw what my fathers
life-work had been to rear a court to
people rougemont my father had been
twenty-five at my mothers death he had
died at fifty-eight he had had thirty-
three years to make his dream come true

  where are the parents of the ones
who were born at rougemont

  at their own places or the farms
my lord rougemont has over a thousand
acres and several manors upon it where
people whom his highness your father
advanced over others live they all serve
their ruler in some way in return for
what is given them only the people of
the lodge are in touch with the outside
which we have been taught to look upon
with scorn here we have everything
and to be taken to the chateau itself is
the ambition of everyone on the estate
the lost door



  i saw it all not of course every in-
tricacy of the elaborate system my father
had evolved but at least a glimmer of
the truth and i marveled at the charac-
ter of a man who had taken children out
of the world to make his own world and
then had the patience to wait for them to
grow up to form his court-the court he
planned for me yes in my egotism i
thought it was for me two weeks were
to pass before i learned what his real
reason had been

  into my reflections wrexler broke
abruptly she is not here ask de lacy
about her her beauty haunts me already
i am in love with her

  i was not surprized nothing i felt
could at this point surprize me so much
had happened in the last few hours if
my father had arisen from the floor like
hamlets ghost i would have greeted
him quite casually

  is there a young girl here with
bronze curls and blue eyes i asked
obediently

  a shadow crossed de lacys handsome
face for the first time he hesitated
there is no one here that answers that
description may i ask why you-

  my friend saw her on the stairway

  i caught a murmur from de lacys
lips so soon it sounded like but be-
fore i could question further he said
aloud i have leave to depart and join
my lady and before i could answer
he bowed himself away to take a seat
at one of the tables below

  wrexler looked over his wine goblet
the man lied i saw recognition of the
description in his eyes

  well get the truth out of him later
 countered isnt it fine to actually eat
chicken with your fingers and not feel
you are committing a social error

we did not get any information out
of de lacy later to wrexlers in-
sistent questionings he was at first non-
committal and after a bit downright
curt i poured oil on the troubled waters
by suggesting that as it was late we
would wait until morning to see the
library and the left wing of the chateau

  with a smile of relief de lacy ushered
us to our chambers my retiring was a
kind of ceremony it amused me but i
had a nagging little thought in the back
of my mind that all this etiquette would
become boring after a while

  as the last man bowed himself out
of my room de lacy bent low my
lord there are guards at your door you
have only to call if you require anything

  i thanked him once more greatly to
my embarrassment he again kissed my
hand your servant to the death he
cried and drew the curtains about my
high-canopied bed

  i knew that outside the red damask
two huge candles were burning but the
curtain shut out their light and i was
smothered in darkness i made a mental
note that i must arrange somehow for
air in my room the french idea of
banishing night air did not coincide with
my american habits tonight i was too
weary to get up and attend to it my
thoughts were racing back and forth
among the strange events of the day but
before i could focus them into any kind
of order sleep descended upon me

  i had a strange dream in it the most
beautiful woman i had ever seen came
and parted the red damask curtains
framed against the dark oak panels of
my room she stood looking down upon
me her hair was red gold and her
eyes had all the sapphire tints of the
world stored in their depths her pale
white face was oval in shape and bal-
anced perfectly upon a slender neck her


weird tales

lips were sweetly curved and her nose
delicately shaped as she bent over me
i could see the rounded curve of her
bosom one slim hand reached out and
touched my cheek it was like the touch
of a falling rose petal

  in my dream i lay asleep yet i was
conscious of this lovely creature i
watched her through closed eyelids and
held my breath hoping she would kiss
me it seemed as though i had never
desired anything so much

  a half-smile hovered on her lips
but her eyes told me nothing she
leaned lower a faint perfume per-
vaded my senses and then i felt her lips
upon my forehead a great cold swept
over me at her touch-swept me down
down into blackness and i knew no
more

when i awoke the sun was pour-
ing through the opened curtains
i reached for a cigarette-my first
conscious thought upon awakening-and
not finding my case under the pillow
suddenly realized my new surroundings
at the same time i remembered my
dream wrexler and his talk of a red-
haired beauty is responsible for that
i thought as i clapped my hands

  de lacy came in so quickly i knew
he must have been waiting outside the
door he started when he saw the curtain
of my bed had been opened did you
not pull them i asked

  he shook his head i said no more
and the ceremony of my arising began

  when i had bathed in a great sunken
tub-fortunately diana de poictiers had
had her daily bath in the far-off time-
i sought wrexler

  together we breakfasted and then i
announced to de lacy that we wished to
inspect the rest of the chateau he led
us to the left wing and took us through
suite after suite beautifully furnished

the chateau was a veritable treasure house
an antiquarian would have gone mad
with delight

  i noticed that de lacy had avoided two
heavily built doors opposite the ballroom
when we had returned from our tour i
stopped before them and here i
asked

  the picture gallery my lord he
responded unwillingly and swung the
doors open there was an unhappy ex-
pression on his face

  the room was long and narrow and
the walls except for the windows were
lined with portraits we walked slowly
down the length of the room looking
at the portraits of a dead and gone race

  the former owners of the chateau
i asked de lacy nodded

  suddenly i looked at the part of the
room facing the door which he had
entered at first we had been too far
away to distinguish anything about it
except that there was only one large
painting hanging in the center now
that i was nearer i could see the paint-
ing and i caught my breath in astonish-
ment for there was the portrait of the
lady of my dream smiling down on me

  wrexler caught my arm thats the
girl-the one i saw on the stairs

  that is the portrait of helene
mademoiselle dharcourt daughter of
the lord of harcourt who owned this
chateau de lacys voice broke in

  wrexler and i exclaimed simul-
taneously but i- and she is-

  de lacy looked at us strangely it is
from her that the chateau got its new
name rougemont-red mountain be-
fore that it was called hdtel dharcourt
mademoiselle helene was very beautiful
as you can see messieurs and she had
many suitors at last from among them
she chose an english lord one of the
discarded lovers black george-le
georges noir-vowed that she should
the lost door



not belong to the englishman or ever
leave rougemont

  she laughed mademoiselle helene
and her father the lord dharcourt
laughed too for he had many men at arms
and was rich and powerful black george
did not laugh he only set his lips grimly
the wedding day came and the beautiful
helene married the english lord in the
great hall but just as he took her in his
arms for the nuptial kiss there arose a
great noise outside it was black george
attacking the chateau

  the english lord with helenes kiss
warm upon his lips went forth to battle
there was a fight such as these peaceful
lands had never seen and the mountain
ran red with blood black george was
the victor he slew the englishman he
slew the lord of harcourt and his men
hacked to pieces the defenders of the
chateau

  black george followed by his men
their swords red with blood came into
the great hall where helene dharcourt
sat on the throne her face whiter than
her wedding dress black george flung
her lovers body at her feet and the
women of the household who were
crouched about the throne cried aloud
with terror the fair helene did not cry
nor did she moan she only looked
straight at black george and there was
that in her gaze that silenced everyone
in the great hall even black george
stepped back a pace

  then helene dharcourt rose and
went down to her love the english lord
who for a brief moment had been her
husband she knelt beside him and
kissed his cold lips then she took her
wedding veil and laid it over his body

  all the while there was silence in
the great hall while men and women
watched the slim girl say farewell to the
man she loved they watched almost as
though they were under a spell but as

the veil fell into place black george
laughed a long laugh that rang through
the room then he turned to his followers
and cried loudly the women are yours
-take them as you will all but that one
who belongs to me he gestured toward
helene and laughed again

  helene dharcourt stood erect and
pointed her slender hand at black
george wait she cried and there was
a quality in her voice that made her
listeners tremble i shall belong to no
one until my lover comes for me and
till he comes wo to you black george
who are well named wo to you and
to all men for i curse you with a mighty
curse the curse of a broken heart and
i curse all men for their black and bitter
deeds year after year century after cen-
tury i will take my vengeance for the
wrongs i have suffered and no man shall
be free until my lover comes again and
we find bliss together

  and while the eyes of the whole hall
were riveted upon her she plunged the
dagger she had taken from her lovers
belt into her heart for a second she
stood swaying then she crumpled and
fell beside the english lord

  black george caught her and held
her in his arms my curse upon you
black george she cried

  black george could also curse-
never shall you leave rougemont to
find your lover and never shall he come

until- and then his voice died away

as her head fell backward over his arm
the fair helene was beyond his reach

  for a minute more the people in the
great hall were paralyzed by the force
of the terrible words that they had
heard but with the girls death they were
released from the spell and a fury swept
over the men they rushed upon the
women and dragged them forth black
george took helenes body and carried
it away but where he buried her no one


weird tales

knew nor could any discover for the
next day he was found in the great hall
raving mad and the people said that
helenes curse was a potent one that al-
ready it had wreaked vengeance on
the one who had wronged her most

  from that day the chateau was
called rougemont the dharcourts were
all dead and the place fell into other
hands then there grew up the rumor
that the chateau was haunted that die
fair helene roamed through its halls
cut off from her lover and doomed to
stay within these walls by black georges
curse

de lacy silent wrexler and i looked
at the portrait my own feelings
were in a turmoil it had been a ghosts
lips that had touched me last night yet
surely no ghosts could have been so
beautiful or seemed so real

  wrexler turned to me it would be
the curse that has always been upon me
that when i fell in love it would be with
a ghost his eyes were vivid shining
brightly in his pale face i knew when
i saw her on die stairway that i loved
her

  there is a rumor said de lacy
that the man who sees the fair helene
will meet with some misadventure unless
she gives him a kiss then he is pro-
tected from her wrath

  i started wrexler smiled she kissed
me with her eyes i am not afraid
the fair helene makes men suffer
to make up for the wrong black george
did her for years she has not been seen
at rougemont last night when you
described her i was afraid my lord
de lacy turned to me send your friend
away if she only looked at him and
smiled there is a grave and deadly
danger for him more deadly because it
may be unexplainable men upon whom

the fair helene has smiled have met
strange deaths

  as wrexler looked up at the portrait
an inward light illumined his coun-
tenance i am not afraid he repeated

  there are many deaths there is the
death of the spirit as well as that of the
body i beg you to go while there is
time friend of my lord there was real
feeling in de lacys voice

  i too felt afraid for wrexler the
strange unworldly feeling he had always
had the pulling toward something he
knew not what made me doubly fearful
had the fair helene been calling him
all this time across the world for my-
self i had no fear she had kissed me
and besides even death at her hands
would have been preferable to never
seeing her again in these last few
minutes i had realized that i too was
in love with helene that i could hardly
wait for the night in hopes that she
might visit me again

  resolutely i put my own feelings in
the background for at the moment
wrexler was of paramount importance
if there was anything in de lacys story
-and from my own experience i was
sure there was-wrexler was in danger
i turned to him if anything happened
to you i could never forgive myself
perhaps youd better go i could arrange
a trip for you and later-meet you

  somehow de lacy seemed one of us
i had no hesitancy in speaking before
him he seemed a part of my new life
with the strange suddenness that comes
on rare occasions we were already
friends

  wrexler looked at me then back at the
portrait helene dharcourt her red
hair gleaming smiled down upon us
before he spoke i knew what he would
say because in his place i would have
said the same unless you kick me out
i want to stay
the lost door



  i put my hand on wrexler s shoulder
so be it come along lets see the
library then well know all of rouge-
mont weve seen everything else
wrenching his eyes away from the
portrait wrexler followed us

  the library was beautiful with
paneled walls that had rows and rows
of books sunk in their depths there
was a long oaken table and on the center
of it stood a carved gilded box the
casket which held my fathers letter i
wished then that i could read it at once
i wish now that i could have but per-
haps it is better that i did not at least
things moved as the fates ordained and
the responsibility for what occurred was
not mine

the next three days were quiet
happy ones nothing occurred i
had no ghostly visitant and wrexler
saw nothing of helene under de lacys
expert guidance we rode over the estate
hunted with falcons a pleasing sport
which we both took to our hearts
mingled with my court found the people
charming and highly cultivated we took
lessons in the old dances visited the
manor houses it was all very gay and
amusing and i had no longing for the
outside world i did not even go down
to the lodge for news

  there were many details of the estate
management that i had to go into with
de lacy we spent several hours each
morning going over the affairs of rouge-
mont it was virtually a small kingdom
and everydiing was referred to me

  necessarily the time i spent with de
lacy on such matters wrexler was alone
he had changed a great deal since we
had come to rougemont he had come
alive and he threw himself into every-
thing with a curious intensity he was
like a person who has been very ill who
suddenly finding himself better and

  fearing it is only temporary clutches life
with both hands he devoted long hours
to reading the records of the dharcourts
until he knew the family history as well
as his own

  i did not mention helene although
there was seldom a moment when she
was out of my thoughts i found myself
watching for her day and night and i
caught the same tension in wrexlers
eyes as he searched the shadows

  the third night she came again not
to me but to wrexler and although he
was my friend i almost hated him be-
cause he had seen her and i had not he
told me next morning as we walked
along the lake shore

  jim he said suddenly i saw her
last night she came to my room she
drew aside the curtains of the bed and
leaned over me i cant describe my
sensations it was almost as though life
were suspended in space-like a bridge
over a timeless sea

  i had nothing to say i knew so well
how he felt

  she leaned closer and closer to me
wrexler went on then she smiled and
before i could find my breath to speak
she was gone this is the second time
she has smiled at me i felt a nameless
fear as though there was a threatening
quality in those red lips she looked at
me as though i might have been black
george himself

  in that moment all my envy was
swept away by anxiety for my friend
indeed i wished she had kissed him for
then he would have been safe i started
to speak to beg wrexler to leave rouge-
mont but before the words could leave
my mouth i saw her she was standing
in the path some distance away directly
in line with my eyes and she was shaking
her head impressively

  i knew instantly what she meant i
was not to send wrexler away he


weird tales

  could not see her because at the moment
he was facing me his hand on my arm
his fingers touching me were not quite
steady it brought me back to reality
wrexler i cried you-could leave
rougemont

  her eyes clouded with anger she
looked at me reproachfully command-
ingly as though i were dreaming i
heard my own voice i dont want you
to go i would be lonely without you
perhaps there is no danger

  wrexler looked at me curiously
there is risk i know that but i do not
care i am like a man who has eaten a
strange and terrible drug who knows
the danger but can not resist it i will
stay

  beyond him helene smiled a satisfied
smile as she looked at wrexlers broad
back it made me feel afraid then sud-
denly her gaze swept to me and the
smile changed into a languorous one that
promised all things my heart beat faster
and i forgot my fear

  wrexler moved restlessly turning so
that we were side by side even in that
second helene had vanished-how i do
not know one minute she was there
the next she was not

  we walked along slowly finally
wrexler spoke no matter what hap-
pens and i mean that widely my friend
you are not to regret for a little time
i have been happy i have come alive
i have loved even though the woman
that i love is a wraith i have felt a
sensation i thought never to feel if i
could hold her in my arms and press my
lips to hers i would count the world well
lost

  i could say nothing because-god
pity me-i knew just how he felt

the days slipped away quickly i
did not see helene again but wrex-
ler did almost every day he met her

in the rose garden where they spent
long hours

  he told me that she was always elusive
but at the same time promising that some
day she would be kinder he said her
voice was like golden honey and that
without her he could not face life

  once i saw them myself as i came
from an interview with de lacy as i
approached the rose garden through an
opening in the arches i saw them sitting
side by side on the marble bench and of
the two helene looked the more earthly
for wrexler had grown paler and more
ethereal every day his eyes were
luminous as he looked at her adoringly

  she saw me first and her lips curved
sweetly she rose in a leisurely fashion
turned her back to me and dropped a low
curtsy to wrexler then while i still
watched she extended one slender hand
to him he bent over it his lips touched
its soft whiteness a little laugh like
the tinkle of silver bells swept through
the garden then she was gone

  wrexler stood like a man in a trance
i came quickly forward you are play-
ing with fire i cried

  wrexler roused you saw

  i	nodded

  have you ever seen anything more
beautiful more lovely

  i	shook my head

  stm not afraid any more she has

promised me-

  but what helene had promised i was
not to know for wrexlers mouth shut
with a snap when i pressed him he
shook his head finally he said carefully
choosing his words with a reluctance that
was strange to him

  to me is to be granted something
beyond the knowledge of mortal man

i	can tell you no more but some day
you will know there was an expres-
sion on his face that transcended earth
the next night i spoke to de lacy
the lost door



and told him my fears wrexler was
spending more and more time in the
rose garden i hardly saw him and he
would not discuss anything with me
even at the stately elegantly served
meals he barely spoke he always
seemed to be listening waiting

  de lacy shared my fears but he sug-
gested nothing to help he has been
marked my lord he said gravely we
can only pray but even in prayers
there is no refuge for helene is beyond
such things

  surely- i began to remonstrate

  the power of evil is as strong as
the power of good or at least there is
little between them helene herself is
bound fast by hate of blade george
curses live i knew that-witness the
lasting quality of the curses and spells
of the egyptian priests but helene was
not evil i said as much

  de lacy shook his head she is cut
off from her lover she does not feel
kindly toward men remember she
promised vengeance century after cen-
tury that day in the great hall

  that night in the silence of my cham-
ber i called her name helene helene
i flung my agonized summons into the
night but there was no answer

  i went over in my mind the tales de
lacy had told me of the havoc she had
caused how one man had cast himself
down from the highest turret crying her
name how another had been found
dead in the rose garden horror frozen
on his face there were still others who
had looked upon her and death or
madness came as the result

  the more i thought of these tales of
terror the more i feared for wrexler
at last i could stand no more i thrust
my arms into the rich velvet robe that
had taken the place of my bath gown
and went to wrexlers room the guards
stood back to let me pass

i did not mean to wake him but some
inner foreboding made me feel i
must know that he was safe

  as i drew aside the curtains of his
bed i could not entirely stifle the cry
that came to my lips for the bed was
empty but upon the pillow lay a small
white rose it was the kind they use in
funeral wreaths in france my heart
almost stopped beating

  the rose garden-or perhaps the
library a more normal thought struck
me wrexler might have wanted to read
i rushed into the hall to find de lacy
waiting for me summoned by the guards
he held a silver candle-stick in which a
tall white candle burned

  the library i gasped that was
nearest we should try it first de lacy
knew my meaning he had instantly
grasped the situation and his face was
white and tense

  together we descended the curving
stairway together we reached the li-
brary then motioning de lacy behind
me i swung open the door

  the room was brightly illuminated
although not one of the candles had
been lit in the middle of it stood
wrexler with helene in his arms their
lips were close-locked

  it was a picture that an artist would
have delighted to paint the stiff crim-
son skirts of helene dharcourts gown
stood wide on either side and wrexlers
blue doublet and hose against them was
in bold relief his long over-sleeves
edged with fur hung gracefully

  i could not speak this mating of man
with ghost was almost more than my
poor mortal brain could bear yet with
every atom of my being i wished that i
could have been in wrexlers place i
remembered the one chaste kiss i had had
from her and i almost fainted at the
thought of possessing those lips for my
own as wrexler was doing strangely


weird tales

enough mingling with this emotion was
another-a feeling of fear and anxiety
for my friend cold horror that froze
my blood kept me rooted to the spot

  behind me de lacy had fallen to his
knees i could hear him repeating the
latin words of a prayer all at once i
saw where the light was coming from
the entire north wall ordinarily lined
with books had gone in its stead was
a stone wall and in the center of the
wall was a low-hung gothic door carved
and ornate it was standing open and
beyond was a pale luminous yellow mist
i could see nothing of what else was be-
yond the door for the yellow haze filled
the entire space it was like a golden
fog and its radiance lighted the library
with a strange unearthly glow its
luminosity glowed upon helene and
wrexler like a spotlight

  for a moment i thought rougemont
de lacy everything of the past weeks
must have been a dream and that i was
watching a cinema of past days all at
once before my astonished eyes helene
gently drew her lips away from wrex-
lers she slipped from his arms and
extended her hands to him come i
heard her say

  wrexler had been right her voice was
like golden honey it was like the music
of willow trees in early spring wrexler
grasped her hands for the first time i
saw his face joy transfigured it such
joy as i have never seen before and never
shall see again

  helene moved backward slowly but
surely drawing him toward the little
gothic door that stood open with her
soft lips half parted she whispered
come

  wrexler i cried suddenly

  he did not hear me as he looked
into her eyes he might have been a bird
charmed by a snake nothing could
break through the spell that bound him

  they were nearer the door each
second brought them closer to it now
helene was on the other side the
golden mist concentrated upon her until
she looked like a goddess in its eery light

  wrexler wrexler the words tore
through my throat

  wrexler stepped over the threshold
through the golden mist i saw him
clasp helene in his arms again i saw her
smile triumphantly at me as she raised
her lips to his there was something in
her eyes that filled me with horror

  the mist swirled about them until i
could barely discover the outlines of
their figures through its gleaming haze
then the door swung slowly shut

  i awoke to feverish activity wrexler
wrexler i shouted and rushed forward
to the door

  i grasped the iron ring that hung in
its center i pulled on it with all my
might when i found that it resisted all
my efforts i began beating against the
door itself presently i felt myself being
pulled away

  there is no use my lord de lacys
voice was saying the door is gone
gone i ejaculated and even as i
spoke i saw what he meant the north
wall of the library was lined with books
as it always had been i had been beat-
ing upon them impotently

  i looked down at my hands the
knuckles were raw and bleeding just as
they would have been from pounding on
a heavily carved wooden door de lacy
caught my meaning the door was
there my lord it was the lost door-
the door behind which black george
buried helene dharcourt it had been
lost for centuries

  i sank into a chair weakly for now the
fact that i had lost wrexler my friend
was paramount i will tear down the
walls until i find it

  that has been done my lord and it
the lost door



has never been found it will never be
found again only for a brief moment
you and i have been granted a glimpse
of something we can not understand

  and wrexler- i groaned

  he was happy de lacy comforted
no matter what happened after he has
had happiness such as i have never seen
before

  my head pitched forward and i knew
no more

three days later i was escorted to
the library by de lacy to whom
since wrexlers loss i was more devoted
than ever with great ceremony i was
given the key to the gilded casket then
left alone

  seated in the great chair before the
oaken table i unlocked the casket it
contained many pages closely written in
my fathers hand in them were instruc-
tions as to my future conduct my care of
rougemont what he had done and what
he expected me to do but the lines that
interested me most were these

   bought rougemont for your mother
shortly after your birth because when
tiding through this country she saw and
loved it it was a purchase that cost me
dear for rougemont held a curse and
an avenging spirit in the form of a beau-
tiful young girl who could not bear to
see others happiness so my wife died

  two months after your mothers
death i first saw la belle helene we
fought a long battle she and  but i
was strong my son because i loved
your mother no other womans charms
could lure me to my doom finally i
made a bargain with a ghost

  tshe hated modern things and longed
for rougemont to be great again 
promised to restore the chateau to its
former splendor to make it just as it

had been in her days and in return she
promised immunity to me and after-
ward to you and to all my court when
i should have established it

  i restored rougemont i repeopled
it with her help and advice i have
made it as it was in her own day

  she showed me the hidden treasure
vaults of the dharcourts so that i would
have enough money to purchase the
things she wanted

  she too has kept her bargain for
i and my court have lived happily here
unmolested only when an outsider
came or someone disobeyed or longed
for the outside world has she wreaked
vengeance

  she has sworn to give you the kiss
that promises immunity the night you
come only beware my son whom you
bring here from the world you know
and beware of the lovely helene old
man as i am devoted to your mothers
memory as i am she can still make my
pulses leap

  above all things if she shows you the
lost door do not be tempted to cross
its threshold for that way unless you are
the reincarnation of the englishman
annihilation lies

  there was more pages more of other
matters but i left them for another day
alone there in the library i let my eyes
wander to where the little gothic door
had been

  had wrexler been the englishman
come back to earth to claim his bride
could that account for the strange un-
satisfied longings he had always had his
unearthly feelings his unlikeness to other
people or was he black george lured
back to rougemont for helenes ven-
geance i hope for his sake that was not
the explanation that he and helene


weird tales

vould find bliss waiting for them behind
the lost door and i would never see
helene again

the days pass i do what my father
set out for me to do i keep his bargain

with the ghost of the fair helene i
never leave rougemont i have no
desire to for i am always hoping that
some day i shall again find the lost
door

zoom of the house
of duryea

by earl peirce jr

ra powerful story of stark horror and the dreadful thing that happened
in a lone house in the maine woods

arthur duryea a young hand-
some man came to meet his
 father for the first time in
twenty years as he strode into the
hotel lobby-long strides which had the
spring of elastic in them-idle eyes lifted
to appraise him for he was an impres-
sive figure somehow grim with exal-
tation

  the desk clerk looked up with his
habitual smile of expectation how-do-
you-do-mr-so-and-so and his fingers
strayed to the green fountain pen which
stood in a holder on the desk

  arthur duryea cleared his throat but
still his voice was clogged and unsteady
to the clerk he said

  im looking for my father doctor
henry duryea i understand he is
registered here he has recently arrived
from paris

  the clerk lowered his glance to a list
of names doctor duryea is in suite 
sixth floor he looked up his eyebrows

arched questioningly are you staying
too sir mr duryea

  arthur took the pen and scribbled his
name rapidly without a further word
neglecting even to get his key and own
room number he turned and walked to
the elevators not until he readied his
fathers suite on the sixth floor did he
make an audible noise and this was a
mere sigh which fell from his lips like
a prayer

  the man who opened the door was
unusually tall his slender frame clothed
in tight-fitting black he hardly dared
to smile his clean-shaven face was pale
an almost livid whiteness against the
sparkle in his eyes his jaw had a bluish
luster

  arthur the word was scarcely a
whisper it seemed choked up quietly
as if it had been repeated time and again
on his thin lips

  arthur duryea felt the kindliness of

                    w t-z
doom of the house of duryea



those eyes go through him and then he
was in his fathers embrace

  later when these two grown men had
regained their outer calm they closed the
door and went into the drawing-room
the elder duryea held out a humidor
of fine cigars and his hand shook so
hard when he held the match that his son
was forced to cup his own hands about
the flame they both had tears in their
eyes but their eyes were smiling

  henry duryea placed a hand on his
sons shoulder this is the happiest day

of my life he said you can never
know how mudi i have longed for this
moment

  arthur looking into that glance
realized with growing pride that he had
loved his father all his life despite any
of those things which had been cursed
against him he sat down on the edge
of a chair

  i-i dont know how to act he
confessed you surprize me dad
youre so different from what i had
expected

he lay like a waxen figure tied to his bed

  wt-


weird tales

  a cloud came over doctor duryeas
features what did you expea arthur
he demanded quickly an evil eye a
shaven head and knotted jowls

  please dad-no arthurs words
clipped short i dont think i ever
really visualized you i knew you would
be a splendid man but i thought youd
look older more like a man who has
really suffered

  i have suffered more than i can ever
describe but seeing you again and the
prospect of spending the rest of my life
with you has more than compensated
for my sorrows even during the twenty
years we were apart i found an ironic joy
in learning of your progress in college
and in your american game of football
then youve been following my
work

  yes arthur ive received monthly
reports ever since you left me from my
study in paris ive been really close to
you working out your problems as if
they were my own and now that the
twenty years are completed the ban
which kept us apart is lifted for ever
from now on son we shall be the closest
of companions-unless your aunt ce-
cilia has succeeded in her terrible
mission

thb mention of that name caused an
unfamiliar chill to come between the
two men it stood for something in each
of them which gnawed dieir minds like
a malignancy but to the younger duryea
in his intense effort to forget the awful
past her name as well as her madness
must be forgotten

  he had no wish to carry on this sub-
ject of conversation for it betrayed an
internal weakness which he hated with
forced determination and a ludicrous
lift of his eyebrows he said

  cecilia is dead and her silly super-
stition is dead also from now on dad

were going to enjoy life as we should
bygones are really bygones in this case
doctor duryea closed his eyes slowly
as though an exquisite pain had gone
through him

  then you have no indignation he
questioned you have none of your
aunts hatred

  indignation hatred arthur
laughed aloud ever since i was twelve
years old i have disbelieved cecilias
stories i have known that those horrible
things were impossible that they be-
longed to the ancient category of myth-
ology and tradition how then can i
be indignant and how can i hate you
how can i do anything but recognize
cecilia for what she was-a mean frus-
trated woman cursed with an insane
grudge against you and your family i
tell you dad that nothing she has ever
said can possibly come between us again

  henry duryea nodded his head his
lips were tight together and the muscles
in his throat held back a cry in that
same soft tone of defense he spoke
further doubting words

  are you so sure of your subconscious
mind arthur can you be so certain
that you are free from all suspicion
however vague is there not a lingering
premonition-a premonition which
warns of peril

  no dad-no arthur shot to his
feet i dont believe it ive never
believed it i know as any sane man
would know that you are neither a vam-
pire nor a murderer you know it too
and cecilia knew it only she was mad

  that family rot is dispelled father
this is a civilized century belief in vam-
pirism is sheer lunacy wh-why its too
absurd even to think about

you have the enthusiasm of youth
said his father in a rather tired voice
but have you not heard the legend
arthur stepped back instinctively he
doom of the house of duryea



moistened his lips for their dryness
might crack them the-legend

  he said the word in a curious hush of
awed softness as he had heard his aunt
cecilia say it many times before

  that awful legend that you-

  that i eat my children

  oh god father arthur went to
his knees as a cry burst through his lips
dad that-thats ghastly we must
for get cecilias ravings

  you are affectcd then asked doctor
duryea bitterly

  affected certainly im affected
but only as i should be at such an accusa-
tion cecilia was mad i tell you those
books she showed me years ago and
those folk-tales of vampires and ghouls-
they burned into my infantile mind like
acid they haunted me day and night
in my youth and caused me to hate you
worse than death itself

  but in heavens name father ive
outgrown those things as i have out-
grown my clothes im a man now do
you understand that a man with a
mans sense of logic

 yes i understand henry duryea
threw his cigar into the fireplace and
placed a hand on his sons shoulder

  we shall forget cecilia he said as
i told you in my letter i have rented a
lodge in maine where we can go to be
alone for the rest of the summer well
get in some fishing and hiking and per-
haps some hunting but first arthur i
must be sure in my own mind that you
are sure in yours i must be sure you
wont bar your door against me at night
and sleep with a loaded revolver at your
elbow i must be sure that youre not
afraid of going up there alone with me

and dying-

  his voice ended abruptly as if an age-
long dread had taken hold of it his
sons face was waxen with sweat stand-
ing out like pearls on his brow he said

nothing but his eyes were filled with
questions which his lips could not put
into words his own hand touched his
fathers and tightened over it

  henry duryea drew his hand away

  im sorry he said and his eyes
looked straight over arthurs lowered
head this thing must be thrashed out
now i believe you when you say that
you discredit cecilias stories but for a
sake greater than sanity i must tell you
the truth behind the legend-and believe
me arthur there is a truth

he climbed to his feet and walked
to the window which looked out
over the street below for a moment
he gazed into space silent then he
turned and looked down at his son

  you have heard only your aunts ver-
sion of the legend arthur doubtless it
was warped into a thing far more hideous
than it actually was-if that is possible
doubtless she spoke to you of the inquis-
itorial stake in carcassonne where one of
my ancestors perished also she may
have mentioned that book vampyrs
which a former duryea is supposed to
have written then certainly she told
you about your two younger brothers-
my own poor motherless children-
who were sucked bloodless in their
cradles   

  arthur duryea passed a hand across
his aching eyes those words so often
repeated by that witch of an aunt stirred
up the same visions which had made his
childhood nights sleepless with terror
he could hardly bear to hear them again
-and from the very man to whom they
were accredited

  listen arthur  the elder duryea
went on quickly his voice low with the
pain it gave him you must know that
true basis to your aunts hatred you
must know of that curse-that curse of
vampirism which is supposed to have fol-


weird tales

lowed the duryeas through five centuries
of french history but which we can dis-
pel as pure superstition so often connec-
ted with ancient families but i must
tell you that this part of the legend is
true

  your two young brothers actually
died in their cradles bloodless and i
stood trial in france for their murder
and my name was smirched throughout
all of europe with such an inhuman
damnation that it drove your aunt and
you to america and has left me child-
less hated and ostracized from society
the world over

  i must tell you that on that terrible
night in duryea castle i had been work-
ing late on historic volumes of crespet
and prinn and on that loathsome tome
vampyrs i must tell you of the sore-
ness that was in my throat and of the
heaviness of the blood which coursed
through my veins    and of that
presence which was neither man nor
animal but which i knew was some place
near me yet neither within the castle
nor outside of it and which was closer
to me than my heart and more terrible
to me than the touch of the grave   

  i was at the desk in my library my
head swimming in a delirium which left
me senseless until dawn there were
nightmares that frightened me-fright-
ened me arthur a grown man who had
dissected countless cadavers in morgues
and medical schools i know that my
tongue was swollen in my mouth and
that brine moistened my lips and that a
rottenness pervaded my body like a
fever

  i can make no recollection of sanity
or of consciousness that night remains
vivid unforgettable yet somehow com-
pletely in shadows when i had fallen
asleep-if in gods name it was sleep-
i was slumped across my desk but when
i awoke in the morning i was lying face

down on my couch so you see arthur
i had moved during that night and i
had never known it

  what id done and where id gone
during those dark hours will always re-
main an impenetrable mystery but i do
know this on the morrow i was tom
from my sleep by the shrieks of maids
and butlers and by that mad wailing of
your aunt i stumbled through the open
door of my study and in the nursery i
saw those two babies there-lifeless
white and dry like mummies and with
twin holes in their necks that were
caked black with their own blood   

  oh i dont blame you for your in-
credulousness arthur i cannot believe
it yet myself nor shall i ever believe it
the belief of it would drive me to
suicide and still the doubting of it drives
me mad with horror

  all of france was doubtful and even
the savants who defended my name at
the trial found that they could not explain
it nor disbelieve it the case was quieted
by the republic for it might have shaken
science to its very foundation and split
the pedestals of religion and logic i was
released from the charge of murder
but the actual murder has hung about
me like a stench

  the coroners who examined those
tiny cadavers found them both dry of
all their blood but could find no blood
on the floor of the nursery nor in the
cradles something from hell stalked the
halls of duryea that night-and i should
blow my brains out if i dared to think
deeply of who that was you too my
son would have been dead and blood-
less if you hadnt been sleeping in a
separate room with your door barred on
the inside

  you were a timid child arthur you
were only seven years old but you were
filled with the folk-lore of those mad
lombards and the decadent poetry of
doom of the house of duryea



your aunt on that same night while i
was some place between heaven and hell
you also heard the padded footsteps on
the stone corridor and heard the tugging
at your door handle for in the morning
you complained of a chill and of terrible
nightmares which frightened you in your
sleep  i only thank god that your
door was barred

henry duryeas voice choked into
a sob which brought the stinging
tears back into his eyes he paused to
wipe his face and to dig his fingers into
his palm

  you understand arthur that for
twenty years under my sworn oath at
the palace of justice i could neither see
you nor write to you twenty years my
son while all of that time you had
grown to hate me and to spit at my name
not until your aunts death have you
called yourself a duryea    and now
you come to me at my bidding and say
you love me as a son should love his
father

  perhaps it is gods forgiveness for
everything now at last we shall be
together and that terrible unexplainable
past will be buried for ever   

  he put his handkerchief back into his
pocket and walked slowly to his son he
dropped to one knee and his hands
gripped arthurs arms

  my son i can say no more to you

i	have told you the truth as i alone know
it i may be by all accounts some
ghoulish creation of satan on earth i
may be a child-killer a vampire some
morbidly diseased specimen of vrykolakas
-things which science cannot explain

  perhaps the dreaded legend of the
duryeas is true autiel duryea was con-
victed of murdering his brother in that
same monstrous fashion in the year 
and he died in flames at the stake
francois duryea in  blew his head

apart with a blunderbuss on the morning
after his youngest son was found dead
apparently from anemia and there are
others of whom i cannot bear to speak
that would chill your soul if you were to
hear them

  so you see arthur there is a hellish
tradition behind our family there is a
heritage which no sane god would ever
have allowed the future of the duryeas
lies in you for you are the last of die
race i pray with all of my heart that
providence will permit you to live your
full share of years and to leave other
duryeas behind you and so if ever
again i feel that presence as i did in
duryea castle i am going to die as
francois duryea died over a hundred
years ago   

  he stood up and his son stood up at
his side

  if you are willing to forget arthur
we shall go up to that lodge in maine
there is a life weve never known
awaiting us we must find that life and
we must find the happiness which a curi-
ous fate snatched from us on those lom-
bard sourlands twenty years ago  



hbnry duryeas tall stature
coupled with a slenderness of frame
and a sleekness of muscle gave him an
appearance that was unusually gaunt his
son couldnt help but think of that word
as he sat on the rustic porch of the
lodge watching his father sunning him-
self at the lakes edge

  henry duryea had a kindliness in his
face at times an almost sublime kindli-
ness which great prophets often possess
but when his face was partly in shadows
particularly about his brow there was a
frightening tone which came into his
features for it was a tone of farness of
mysticism and conjuration somehow in


weird tales

the late evenings he assumed the unap-
proachable mantle of a dreamer and sat
silently before the fire his mind ever off
in unknown places

  in that little lodge there was no elec-
tricity and the glow of the oil lamps
played curious tricks with the human
expression which frequently resulted in
something unhuman it may have been
the dusk of night the flickering of the
lamps but arthur duryea had certainly
noticed how his fathers eyes had sunken
further into his head and how his
cheeks were tighter and the outline of
his teeth pressed into the skin about his
lips

it was nearing sundown on the second
day of their stay at timber lake six
miles away the dirt road wound on
toward houtlon near the canadian
border so it was lonely there on a soli-
tary little lake hemmed in closely with
dark evergreens and a sky which drooped
low over dusty-summited mountains

  within the lodge was a homy fireplace
and a glossy elks-head which peered out
above the mantel there were guns and
fishing-tackle on the walls shelves of
reliable american fiction-mark twain
melville stockton and a well-worn edi-
tion of bret harte

  a fully supplied kitchen and a wood
stove furnished them with hearty meals
which were welcome after a whole days
tramp in the woods on that evening
henry duryea prepared a select french
stew out of every available vegetable
and a can of soup they ate well then
stretched out before the fire for a smoke
they were outlining a trip to the orient
together when the back door blew open
with a terrific bang and a wind swept
into the lodge with a coldness which
chilled them both

  a storm henry duryea said rising
to his feet sometimes they have them

up here and theyre pretty bad the roof
might leak over your bedroom perhaps
youd like to sleep down here with me
his fingers strayed playfully over his
sons head as he went out into the kitchen
to bar the swinging door

  arthurs room was upstairs next to a
spare room filled with extra furniture
hed chosen it because he liked the alti-
tude and because the only other bedroom
was occupied   

  he went upstairs swiftly and silently
his roof didnt leak it was absurd even
to think it might it had been his father
again suggesting that they sleep together
he had done it before in a jesting
whispering way-as if to challenge them
both if they dared to sleep together

  arthur came back downstairs dressed
in his bath-robe and slippers he stood
on the fifth stair rubbing a two-days
growth of beard i think ill shave
tonight he said to his father may i
use your razor

  henry duryea draped in a black
raincoat and with his face haloed in the
brim of a rain-hat looked up from the
hall a frown glided obscurely from his
features not at all son sleeping up-
stairs

  arthur nodded and quickly said are
you-going out

  yes im going to tie the boats up
tighter im afraid the lake will rough
it up a bit

  duryea jerked back the door and
stepped outside the door slammed
shut and his footsteps sounded on the
wood flooring of the porch

  arthur came slowly down the remain-
ing steps he saw his fathers figure pass
across the dark rectangle of a window
saw the flash of lightning that suddenly
printed his grim silhouette against the
glass

  he sighed deeply a sigh which burned
in his throat for his throat was sore
doom of the house of duryea

and aching then he went into the bed-
room found the razor lying in plain view
on a birch table-top

  as he reached for it his glance fell
upon his fathers open gladstone bag
which rested at the foot of the bed there
was a book resting there half hidden by
a gray flannel shirt it was a narrow
yellow-bound book oddly out of place

  frowning he bent down and lifted it
from the bag it was surprizingly heavy
in his hands and he noticed a faintly
sickening odor of decay which drifted
from it like a perfume the title of the
volume had been thumbed away into an
indecipherable blur of gold letters but
pasted across the front cover was a white
strip of paper on which was typewritten
the word-infantiphagi

  he flipped back the cover and ran his
eyes over the title-page the book was
printed in french-an early french-yet
to him wholly comprehensible the
publication date was  in caen

  breathlessly he turned back a second
page saw a chapter headed vampires

  he slumped to one elbow across the
bed his eyes were four inches from
those mildewed pages his nostrils reeked
with the stench of them

  he skipped long paragraphs of pedan-
tic jargon on theology he scanned brief
accounts of strange blood-eating mon-
sters vrykolakes and leprechauns he
read of jeanne darc of ludvig prinn
and muttered aloud the latin snatches
from episcopi

  he passed pages in quick succession
his fingers shaking with the fear of it
and his eyes hanging heavily in their
sockets he saw vague reference to
enoch and saw the terrible drawings
by an ancient dominican of rome   

  paragraph after paragraph he read the
horror-striking testimony of niders
ant-hill the testimony of people who
died shrieking at the stake the recitals

of grave-tenders of jurists and hang-
men then unexpectedly among all of
this munimental vestige there appeared
before his eyes the name of-autiel
duryea and he stopped reading as
though invisibly struck

thunder clapped near the lodge and
rattled the window-panes the deep
rolling of bursting clouds echoed over
the valley but he heard none of it his
eyes were on those two short sentences
which his father-someone-had under-
lined with dark red crayon

   the execution four years ago of autiel
duryea does not end the duryea controversy
time alone can decide whether the demon has
claimed that family from its beginning to its
end   

  arthur read on about the trial of
autiel duryea before veniti the car-
cassonnean inquisitor-general read with
mounting horror the evidence which had
sent that far-gone duryea to the pillar-
the evidence of a bloodless corpse who
had been autiel duryeas young brother

  unmindful now of the tremendous
storm which had centered over timber
lake unheeding the clatter of windows
and the swish of pines on the roof-even
of his father who worked down at the
lakes edge in a drenching rain-arthur
fastened his glance to the blurred print
of those pages sinking deeper and deeper
into the garbled legends of a dark
age   

  on the last page of the chapter he
again saw the name of his ancestor
autiel duryea he traced a shaking
finger over the narrow lines of words
and when he finished reading them he
rolled sideways on the bed and from his
lips came a sobbing mumbling prayer

  god oh god in heaven protect
me   

  for he had read

   as in the case of autiel duryea we observe
that this specimen of vrykolakcu preys only upon
	weird

the blood in its own family it possesses none
of the characteristics of the undead vampire
being usually a living male person of otherwise
normal appearances unsuspecting its inherent
demonism

   but this vrykolakas cannot act according to its
demoniacal possession unless it is in the presence
of a second member of the same family who acts
as a medium between the man and its demon
this medium has none of the traits of the vam-
pire but it senses the being of this creature
when the metamorphosis is about to occur by
reason of intense pains in the head and throat
both the vampire and the medium undergo
similar reactions involving nausea nocturnal
visions and physical disquietude

  when these two outcasts are within a certain
distance of each other the coalescence of inher-
ent demonism is completed and the vampire is
subject to its attacks demanding blood for its sus-
tenance no member of the family is safe at
these times for the vrykolakas acting in its true
agency on earth will unerringly seek out the
blood in rare cases where other victims are un-
available the vampire will even take the blood
from the very medium which made it possible

   this vampire is born into certain aged families
and naught but death can destroy it it is not
conscious of its blood-madness and acts only in a
psychic state the medium also is unaware of
its terrible re and when these two are to-
gether despite any lapse of years the fusion of
inheritance is so violent that no power known on
earth can turn it back



the lodge door slammed shut with a
sudden interrupting bang the lock
grated and henry duryeas footsteps
sounded on the planked floor

  arthur shook himself from the bed
he had only time to fling that haunting
book into the gladstone bag before he
sensed his father standing in the door-
way

  you-youre not shaving arthur
duryeas words spliced hesitantly were
toneless he glanced from the table-top
to the gladstone and to his son he
said nothing for a moment his glance
inscrutable then

  its blowing up quite a storm
outside

  arthur swallowed the first words
which had come into his throat nodded
quickly yes isnt it quite a storm

tales

he met his fathers gaze his face burn-
ing i-i dont think ill shave dad
my head aches

  duryea came swiftly into the room
and pinned arthurs arms in his grasp
what do you mean-your head aches
how does your throat-

  no arthur jerked himself away he
laughed its that french stew of yours
its hit me in the stomach he stepped
past his father and started up the stairs

  the stew duryea pivoted on his
heel possibly i think i feel it
myself

  arthur stopped his face suddenly
white you-too

  the words were hardly audible their
glances met-clashed like dueling-
swords

  for ten seconds neither of them said a
word or moved a muscle arthur from
the stairs looking down his father be-
low gazing up at him in henry duryea
the blood drained slowly from his face
and left a purple etching across the
bridge of his nose and above his eyes he
looked like a deaths-head

  arthur winced at the sight and twisted
his eyes away he turned to go up the
remaining stairs

  son

  he stopped again his hand tightened

on the banister

  yes dad

  duryea put his foot on the first stair
i want you to lock your door tonight
the wind would keep it banging

  yes breathed arthur and pushed
up the stairs to his room

doctor duryeas hollow footsteps
sounded in steady unhesitant beats
across the floor of timber lake lodge
sometimes they stopped and the crack-
ling hiss of a sulfur match took their
doom of the house of duryea



place then perhaps a distended sigh and
again footsteps   

  arthur crouched at the open door of
his room his head was cocked for those
noises from below in his hands was a
double-barrel shotgun of violent gage

      thud    thud    thud   

  then a pause die clinking of a glass
and the gurgling of liquid the sigh
the tread of his feet over the floor   

  hes thirsty arthur thought-
thirsty

  outside the storm had grown into
fury lightning zigzagged between the
mountains filling the valley with weird
phosphorescence thunder like drums
rolled incessantly

  within the lodge the heat of the fire-
place piled the atmosphere thick with
stagnation all the doors and windows
were locked shut the oil-lamps glowed
weakly-a pale anemic light

  henry duryea walked to the foot of
the stairs and stood looking up

  arthur sensed his movements and
ducked back into his room the gun
gripped in his shaking fingers

  then henry duryeas footstep
sounded on the first stair

  arthur slumped to one knee he
buckled a fist against his teeth as a
prayer tumbled through them

  duryea climbed a second step    and
another    and still one more on the
fourth stair he stopped

  arthur his voice ait into the
silence like the crack of a whip arthur
will you come down here

  yes dad bedraggled his body
hanging like cloth young duryea took
five steps to the landing

  we cant be zanies cried henry
duryea my soul is sick with dread
tomorrow were going back to new
york im going to get the first boat to

open sea    please come down here
he turned about and descended the
stairs to his room

  arthur choked back the words which
had lumped in his mouth half dazed
he followed   

  in the bedroom he saw his father
stretched face-up along the bed he saw
a pile of rope at his fathers feet

  tie me to the bedposts arthur
came the command tie both my hands
and both my feet

  arthur stood gaping

  do as i tell you

  dad what hor-

  dont be a fool you read that book
you know what relation you are to me
id always hoped it was cecilia but now
i know its you i should have known it
on that night twenty years ago when
you complained of a headache and night-
mares    quickly my head rocks with
pain tie me

  speechless his own pain piercing him
with agony arthur fell to that grisly
task both hands he tied-and both
feet    tied them so firmly to the iron
posts that his father could not lift him-
self an inch off the bed

  then he blew out the lamps and
widiout a further glance at that pro-
metheus he reascended the stairs to his
room and slammed and locked his door
behind him

  he looked once at the breech of his
gun and set it against a chair by his bed
he flung off his robe and slippers and
within five minutes he was senseless in
slumber



he slept late and when he awak-
ened his muscles were as stiff as
boards and the lingering visions of a
nightmare clung before his eyes he
pushed his way out of bed stood dazedly
on the floor


ftfeetd tales

  a dull numbing crudation circulated
through his head he felt bloated   
coarse and running with internal mucus
his mouth was dry his gums sore and
stinging

  he tightened his hands as he lunged
for the door dad he cried and he
heard his voice breaking in his throat

  sunlight filtered through the window
at the top of the stairs the air was hot
and dry and carried in it a mild odor of
decay

  arthur suddenly drew back at that
odor-drew back with a gasp of awful
fear for he recognized it-that stench
the heaviness of his blood the rawness
of his tongue and gums    age-long it
seemed yet rising like a spirit in his
memory all of these things he had
known and felt before

  he leaned against the banister and half
slid half stumbled down the stairs   

  his father had died during the night
he lay like a waxen figure tied to his
bed his face done up in knots

  arthur stood dumbly at the foot of
the bed for only a few seconds then he
went back upstairs to his room

  almost immediately he emptied both
barrels of the shotgun into his head

the tragedy at timber lake was dis-
covered accidentally three days later
a party of fishermen upon finding the
two bodies notified state authorities and
an investigation was directly under way

  arthur duryea had undoubtedly met
death at his own hands the condition
of his wounds and the manner with
which he held the lethal weapon at
once foreclosed the suspicion of any foul
play

  but the death of doctor henry duryea
confronted the police with an inexplic-
able mystery for his trussed-up body
unscathed except for two jagged holes
over the jugular vein bad been drained
of all its blood

  the autopsy protocol of henry duryea
laid death to undetermined causes and
it was not until the yellow tabloids com-
menced an investigation into the duryea
family history that the incredible and
fantastic explanations were offered to the
public

  obviously such talk was held in popu-
lar contempt yet in view of the contro-
versial war which followed the author-

shelter of a half-collapsed temple	was neither food nor water in these

thought of vultures wheeling above car-	ancient martian ruins and he knew


weird tales

that it could be only a matter of time
before the urgencies of his own body
would drive him out to signal those
wheeling patrol ships and trade his hard-
won liberty for food and drink he
crouched lower under the shadow of the
temple arch and cursed the accuracy of
the patrol gunner whose flame-blast had
caught his dodging ship just at the edge
of i liars ruins

  presently it occurred to him that in
most martian temples of the ancient
days an ornamental well had stood in
the outer court for the benefit of way-
farers of course all water in it would be
a million years dry now but for lack
of anything better to do he rose from his
seat at the edge of the collapsed central
dome and made his cautious way by still
intact corridors toward the front of the
temple he paused in a tangle of wreck-
age at the courtyards edge and looked
out across the sun-drenched expanse of
pavement toward that ornate well that
once had served travelers who passed by
here in the days when mars was a green
planet

  it was an unusually elaborate well
and amazingly well preserved its rim
had been inlaid with a mosaic pattern
whose symbolism must once have borne
deep meaning and above it in a great
fan of time-defying bronze an elaborate
grille-work portrayed the inevitable tree-
of-life pattern which so often appears in
the symbolism of the three worlds smith
looked at it a bit incredulously from his
shelter it was so miraculously preserved
amidst all this chaos of broken stone
casting a delicate tracery of shadow on
the sunny pavement as perfectly as it
must have done a million years ago when
dusty travelers paused here to drink he
could picture them filing in at noontime
through the great gates that-

  the vision vanished abruptly as his
questing eyes made the circle of the

ruined walls there had been no gate
he could not find a trace of it anywhere
around the outer wall of the court the
only entrance here as nearly as he could
tell from the foundations that remained
had been the door in whose ruins he
now stood queer this must have been
a private court then its great grille-
crowned well reserved for the use of the
priests or wait-had there not been a
priest-king illar after whom the city
was named a wizard-king so legend
said who ruled temple as well as palace
with an iron hand this elaborately
patterned well of material royal enough
to withstand the weight of ages might
well have been sacrosanct for the use of
that long-dead monarch it might-

  across the sun-bright pavement swept
the shadow of a plant smith dodged
back into deeper hiding while the ship
circled low over the courtyard and it
was then as he crouched against a
crumbled wall and waited motionless
for the danger to pass that he became
aware for the first time of a sound that
startled him so he could scarcely credit
his ears-a recurrent sound choked and
sorrowful-the sound of a woman
sobbing

  the incongruity of it made him for-
getful for a moment of the peril hovering
overhead in the sun-hot outdoors the
dimness of the temple ruins became a
living and vital place for that moment
throbbing with the sound of tears he
looked about half in incredulity wonder-
ing if hunger and thirst were playing
tricks on him already or if these broken
halls might be haunted by a million-years-
old sorrow that wept along the corridors
to drive its hearers mad there were tales
of such haunters in some of mars older
ruins the hair prickled faintly at the
back of his neck as he laid a hand on
the butt of his force-gun and commenced
the tree of life



a cautious prowl toward the source of the
muffled noise

  presently he caught a flash of white
luminous in the gloom of these ruined
walls and went forward with soundless
steps eyes narrowed in the effort to make
out what manner of creature this might
be that wept alone in time-forgotten
ruins it was a woman or it had the
dim outlines of a woman huddled
against an angle of fallen walls and
veiled in a fabulous shower of long dark
hair but there was something uncannily
odd about her he could not focus his
pale stare upon her outlines she was
scarcely more than a luminous blot of
whiteness in the gloom shimmering
with a look of unreality which the sound
of her sobs denied

before he could make up his mind
just what to do something must have
warned the weeping girl that she was no
longer alone for the sound of her tears
checked suddenly and she lifted her head
turning to him a face no more distin-
guishable than her bodys outlines he
made no effort to resolve the blurred
features into visibility for out of that
luminous mask burned two eyes that
caught his with an almost perceptible im-
pact and gripped them in a stare from
which he could not have turned if he
would

  they were the most amazing eyes he
had ever met colored like moonstone
milkily translucent so that they looked
almost blind and that magnetic stare
held him motionless in the instant that
she gripped him with that fixed moon-
stone look he felt oddly as if a tangible
bond were taut between them

  then she spoke and he wondered if
his mind after all had begun to give
way in the haunted loneliness of dead
illar for though the words she spoke
fell upon his ears in a gibberish of

meaningless sounds yet in his brain a
message formed with a clarity that far
transcended the halting communication
of words and her milkily colored eyes
bored into his with a fierce intensity

  im lost-im lost- wailed the

voice in his brain

  a rush of sudden tears brimmed the
compelling eyes veiling their brilliance
and he was free again with that cloud-
ing of the moonstone surfaces her
voice wailed but the words were mean-
ingless and no knowledge formed in his
brain to match them stiffly he stepped
back a pace and looked down at her a
feeling of helpless incredulity rising
within him for he still could not focus
directly upon the shining whiteness of
her and nothing save those moonstone
eyes were clear to him

  the girl sprang to her feet and rose
on tiptoe gripping his shoulders with
urgent hands again the blind intensity
of her eyes took hold of his with a
force almost as tangible as the clutch of
her hands again that stream of intelli-
gence poured into his brain strongly
pleadingly

  please please take me back im so
frightened - i cant find my way - oh
please

  he blinked down at her his dazed
mind gradually realizing the basic facts of
what was happening obviously her
milky unseeing eyes held a magnetic
power that carried her thoughts to him
without the need of a common speech
and they were the eyes of a powerful
mind the outlets from which a stream
of fierce energy poured into his brain
yet the words they conveyed were the
words of a terrified and helpless girl a
strong sense of wariness was rising in
him as he considered the incongruity of
speech and power both of which were
beating upon him more urgently with

strong-willed woman carrying the sobs
of a frightened girl there was no sin-
cerity in it

  please please cried her impatience
in his brain help me guide me back

  back where he heard his own voice
asking

  the tree wailed that queer speech
in his brain while gibberish was all his
ears heard and the moonstone stare trans-
fixed him strongly the tree of life
oh take me back to the shadow of the
tree

  a vision of the grille-ornamented well
leaped into his memory it was the only
tree symbol he could think of just then
but what possible connection could there
be between die well and the lost girl-
if she was lost another wail in that un-
known tongue another anguished shake
of his shoulders brought a sudden reso-
lution into his groping mind there
could be no harm in leading her back
to the well to whose grille she must
surely be referring and strong curiosity
was growing in his mind much more
than met the eye was concealed in this
queer incident and a wild guess had
flashed through his mind that perhaps
she might have come from some sub-
terranean world into which the well de-
scended it would explain her luminous
pallor if not her blurriness and too
her eyes did not seem to function in the
light there was a much more incredible
explanation of her presence but he was
not to know it for a few minutes yet

  come along he said taking the
clutching hands gently from his
shoulders t lead you to the well

   she sighed in a deep gust of relief and
dropped her compelling eyes from his
murmuring in that strange gabbling
tongue what must have been thanks he
took her by the hand and turned toward
the ruined archway of the door

  against his fingers her flesh was cool

and firm to the touch she was tangible
but even thus near his eyes refused to
focus upon the cloudy opacity of her
body the dark blur of her streaming hair
nothing but those burning blinded eyes
were strong enough to pierce the veil
that parted them

  she stumbled along at his side over
the rough floor of the temple saying
nothing more panting with eagerness to
return to her incomprehensible tree
how much of that eagerness was assumed
smith still could not be quite sure when
they reached the door he halted her for
a moment scanning the sky for danger
apparently the ships had finished with
this quarter of the city for he could see
two or three of them half a mile away
hovering low over mars northern sec-
tion he could risk it without much
peril he led the girl cautiously out into
the sun-hot court

she could not have known by sight
that they neared the well but when
they were within twenty paces of it she
flung up her blurred head suddenly and
tugged at his hand it was she who led
him that last stretch which parted the
two from the well in the sun the
shadow tracery of the grilles symbolic
pattern lay vividly outlined on the
ground the girl gave a little gasp of
delight she dropped his hand and ran
forward three short steps and plunged
into the very center of that shadowy
pattern on the ground and what hap-
pened then was too incredible to believe

  the pattern ran over her like a gar-
ment curving to the curve of her body in
the way all shadows do but as she stood
there striped and laced with the darkness
of it there came a queer shifting in the
lines of black tracery a subtle inex-
plicable movement to one side and with
that motion she vanished it was exactly
as if that shifting had moved her out of
the tree of life



one world into another stupidly smith
stared at the spot from which she had
disappeared

  ttien several things happened almost
simultaneously the zoom of a plane
broke suddenly into the quiet a black
shadow dipped low over the rooftops
and smith too late realized that he
stood defenseless in full view of the
searching ships there was only one way
out and that was too fantastic to put
faith in but he had no time to hesitate
with one leap he plunged full into the
midst of the shadow of the tree of life

  its tracery flowed round him molding
its pattern to his body and outside the
boundaries everything executed a queer
little sidewise dip and slipped in the most
extraordinary manner like an optical il-
lusion into quite another scene there
was no intervention of blankness it was
as if he looked through the bars of a
grille upon a picture which without warn-
ing slipped sidewise while between the
bars appeared another scene a curious
dim landscape gray as if with the twi-
light of early evening the air had an
oddly thickened look through which he
saw the quiet trees and the flower-
spangled grass of the place with a queer
unreal blending like the landscape in a
tapestry all its outlines blurred

   in the midst of this tapestried twilight
the burning whiteness of the girl he had
followed blazed like a flame she had
paused a few steps away and stood wait-
ing apparently quite sure that he would
come after he grinned a little to him-
self as he realized it knowing that curi-
osity must almost certainly have driven
him in her wake even if the necessity for
shelter had not compelled his following

  she was clearly visible now in this
thickened dimness-visible and very
lovely and a little unreal she shone
with a burning clarity the only vivid
thing in the whole twilit world eyes

upon that blazing whiteness smith
stepped forward scarcely realizing that
he had moved

  slowly he crossed the dark grass
toward her that grass was soft under-
foot and thick with small low-blooming
flowers of a shining pallor botticelli
painted such spangled swards for the
feet of his angels upon it the girls bare
feet gleamed whiter than the blossoms
she wore no garment but the royal mantle
of her hair sweeping about her in a
cloak of shining darkness that had a
queer unreal tinge of purple in that low
light it brushed her ankles in its fabu-
lous length from the hood of it she
watched smith coming toward her a
smile on her pale mouth and a light
blazing in the deeps of her moonstone
eyes she was not blind now nor fright-
ened she stretched out her hand to him
confidently

   it is my turn now to lead you she
smiled as before the words were
gibberish but the penetrating stare of
those strange white eyes gave them a
meaning in the depths of his brain

  automatically his hand went out to
hers he was a little dazed and her eyes
were very compelling her fingers
twined in his and she set off over the
flowery grass pulling him beside her he
did not ask where they were going lost
in the dreamy spell of the still gray en-
chanted place he felt no need for words
he was beginning to see more clearly in
the odd blurring twilight that ran the
outlines of things together in that queer
tapestried manner and he puzzled in a
futile muddled way as he went on over
what sort of land he had come into
overhead was darkness paling into twi-
light near die ground so that when he
looked up he was staring into bottomless
deeps of starless night

  trees and flowering shrubs and the
flower-starred grass stretched emptily


weird tales

about them in the thick confusing gloom
of the place he could see only a little
distance through that dim air it was
as if they walked a strip of tapestried
twilight in some unlighted dream and
the girl with her lovely luminous body
and richly colored robe of hair was like
a woman in a tapestry too unreal and
magical

  after a while when he had become a
little adjusted to the queerness of the
whole scene he began to notice furtive
movements in the shrubs and trees they
passed things flickered too swiftly for
him to catch their outlines but from the
tail of his eye he was aware of motion
and somehow of eyes that watched that
sensation was a familiar one to him and
he kept an uneasy gaze on those shift-
ings in the shrubbery as they went on
presently he caught a watcher in full
view between bush and tree and saw
that it was a man a little furtive dark-
skinned man who dodged hastily back
into cover again before smiths eyes
could do more than take in the fact of
his existence

  after that he knew what to expect and
could make them out more easily little
darting people with big eyes that shone
with a queer sorrowful darkness from
their small frightened faces as they
scuttled through the bushes dodging al-
ways just out of plain sight among the
leaves he could hear the soft rustle of
their passage and once or twice when
they passed near a clump of shrubbery
he thought he caught the echo of little
whispering calls gentle as the rustle of
leaves and somehow full of a strange
warning note so clear that he caught it
even amid the murmur of their speech
warning calls and little furtive hiders in
the leaves and a landscape of tapestried
blurring carpeted with botticelli flower-
strewn sward it was all a dream he
felt quite sure of that

it was a long while before curiosity
awakened in him sufficiently to make
him break the stillness but at last he
asked dreamily

  where are we going

  the girl seemed to understand that
without the necessity of the bond her
hypnotic eyes made for she turned and
caught his eyes in a white stare and an-
swered

  to thag thag desires you

  what is thag

   in answer to that she launched without
preliminary upon a little singsong mono-
log of explanation whose stereotyped for-
mula made him faintly uneasy with the
thought that it must have been made very
often to attain the status of a set speech
made to many men perhaps whom thag
had desired and what became of them
afterward he wondered but the girl
was speaking

  many ages ago there dwelt in iliar
the great king illar for whom the city
was named he was a magician of mighty
power but not mighty enough to fulfill
all his ambitions so by his arts he called
up out of darkness the being known
as thag and with him struck a bargain
by that bargain thag was to give of his
limitless power serving illar all the days
of illars life and in return the king was
to create a land for thags dwelling-place
and people it with slaves and furnish a
priestess to tend thags needs this is
that land i am that priestess the latest
of a long line of women born to serve
thag the tree-people are his-his les-
ser servants

   i have spoken softly so that the tree-
people do not hear for to them thag is
the center and focus of creation the end
and beginning of all life but to you i
have told the truth

  but what does thag want of me

   it is not for thags servants to ques-
tion thag

                     w t-
the tree of life



  then what becomes afterward of the
men thag desires he pursued

  you must ask thag that

  she turned her eyes away as she spoke
snapping the mental bond that had flowed
between them with a suddenness that left
smith dizzy he went on at her side more
slowly pulling back a little on the tug of
her fingers by degrees the sense of
dreaminess was fading and alarm began
to stir in the deeps of his mind after all
there was no reason why he need let this
blank-eyed priestess lead him up to the
very maw of her god she had lured him
into this land by what he knew now to
have been a trick might she not have
worse tricks than that in store for him

  she held him after all by nothing
stronger than the clasp of her fingers if
he could keep his eyes turned from hers
therein lay her real power but he could
fight it if he chose and he began to hear
more clearly than ever the queer note of
warning in the rustling whispers of the
tree-folk who still fluttered in and out of
sight among the leaves the twilight
place had taken on menace and evil

  suddenly he made up his mind he
stopped breaking the clasp of the girls
hand

  im not going he said

  she swung round in a sweep of richly
tinted hair words jetting from her in a
gush of incoherence but he dared not
meet her eyes and they conveyed no
meaning to him resolutely he turned
away ignoring her voice and set out to
retrace the way they had come she called
after him once in a high clear voice that
somehow held a note as warning as that
in the rustling voices of the tree-people
but he kept on doggedly not looking
back she laughed then sweetly and
scornfully a laugh that echoed uneasily
in his mind long after the sound of it
had died upon the twilit air

  after a while he glanced back over one
    w t-

shoulder half expecting to see the lumi-
nous dazzle of her body still glowing in
the dim glade where he had left her but
the blurred tapestry-landscape was quite
empty

  he went on in the midst of a silence
so deep it hurt his ears and in a solitude
unhaunted even by the shy presences of
the tree-folk they had vanished with the
fire-bright girl and the whole twilight
land was empty save for himself he
plodded on across the dark grass crush-
ing the upturned flower-faces under his
boots and asking himself wearily if he
could be mad there seemed little other
explanation for this hushed and tapestried
solitude that had swallowed him up in
that thunderous quiet in that deathly
solitude he went on

when he had walked for what
seemed to him much longer than it
should have taken to reach his starting-
point and still no sign of an exit ap-
peared he began to wonder if there were
any way out of the gray land of thag
for the first time he realized that he had
come through no tangible gateway he
had only stepped out of a shadow and-
now that he thought of it-there were no
shadows here the grayness swallowed
everything up leaving the landscape odd-
ly flat like a badly drawn picture he
looked about helplessly quite lost now
and not sure in what direction he should
be facing for there was nothing here by
which to know directions the trees and
shrubs and the starry grass still stretched
about him uncertainly outlined in that
changeless dusk they seemed to go on
for ever

  but he plodded ahead unwilling to
stop because of a queer tension in the air
somehow as if all the blurred trees and
shrubs were waiting in breathless antici-
pation centering upon his stumbling fig-
ure but all trace of animate life had van-


weird tales

ished with the disappearance of the priest-
ess white-glowing figure head down
paying little heed to where he was going
he went on over the flowery sward

  an odd sense of voids about him star-
tled smith at last out of his lethargic
plodding he lifted his head he stood
just at the edge of a line of trees dim
and indistinct in the unchanging twilight
beyond them-he came to himself with
a jerk and stared incredulously beyond
them the grass ran down to nothingness
merging by imperceptible degrees into a
streaked and arching void-not the sort
of emptiness into which a material body
could fall but a solid nothing curving
up toward the dark zenith as the inside
of a sphere curves no physical thing
could have entered there it was too ut-
terly void an inviolable emptiness which
no force could invade

  he stared up along the inward arch of
that curving impassable wall here then
was the edge of the queer land illar had
wrested out of space itself this arch
must be the curving of solid space which
had been bent awry to enclose the magical
land there was no escape this way he
could not even bring himself to approach
any nearer to that streaked and arching
blank he could not have said why but
it woke in him an inner disquiet so strong
that after a moments staring he turned
his eyes away

  presently he shrugged and set off along
the inside of the line of trees which
parted him from the space-wall perhaps
there might be a break somewhere it
was a forlorn hope but the best that
offered wearily he stumbled on over the
flowery grass

  how long he had gone on along that
almost imperceptibly curving line of bor-
der he could not have said but after a
timeless interval of gray solitude he grad-
ually became aware that a tiny rustling
and whispering among the leaves had

been growing louder by degrees for some
time he looked up in and out among
the trees which bordered that solid wall
of nothingness little indistinguishable
figures were flitting the tree-men had
returned queerly grateful for their pres-
ence he went on a bit more cheerfully
paying no heed to their timid dartings to
and fro for smith was wise in the ways
of wild life

  presently when they saw how little
heed he paid them they began to grow
bolder their whispers louder and
among those rustling voices he thought
he was beginning to catch threads of fa-
miliarity now and again a word reached
his ears that he seemed to recognize lost
amidst the gibberish of their speech he
kept his head down and his hands quiet
plodding along with a cunning stillness
that began to bear results

  from the comer of his eye he could
see that a little dark tree-man had darted
out from cover and paused midway be-
tween bush and tree to inspect the queer
tall stranger nothing happened to this
daring venturer and soon another risked
a pause in the open to stare at the quiet
walker among the trees in a little while
a small crowd of the tree-people was mov-
ing slowly parallel with his course star-
ing with all the avid curiosity of wild
tilings at smiths plodding figure and
among them die rustling whispers grew
louder

  presently the ground dipped down into
a little hollow ringed with trees it was
a bit darker here than it had been on the
higher level and as he went down the
slope of its side he saw that among the
underbrush which filled it were cunningly
hidden huts twined together out of the
living bushes obviously the hollow was
a tiny village where the tree-folk dwelt

  he was surer of this when they began
to grow bolder as he went down into the
dimness of the place the whispers
the tree of life



shrilled a little and the boldest among
his watchers ran almost at his elbow
twittering their queer broken speech in
hushed syllables whose familiarity still
bothered him with its haunting echo of
words he knew when he had reached
the center of the hollow he became aware
that the little folk had spread out in a
ring to surround him wherever he
looked their small anxious faces and
staring eyes confronted him he grinned
to himself and came to a halt waiting
gravely

  none of them seemed quite brave
enough to constitute himself spokesman
but among several a hurried whispering
broke out in which he caught the words
thag and danger and beware he
recognized the meaning of these words
without placing in his mind their origins
in some tongue he knew he knit his
sun-bleached brows and concentrated
harder striving to wrest from that curi-
ous murmuring whisper som hint of its
original root he had a smattering of
more tongues than he could have counted
offhand and it was hard to place these
scattered words among any one speech

  but the word thag had a sound like
that of the very ancient dryland tongue
which upon mars is considered at once
the oldest and the most uncouth of all the
planets languages and with that clue
to guide him he presently began to catch
other syllables which were remotely like
syllables from the dryland speech they
were almost unrecognizable far far more
ancient than the very oldest versions of
the tongue he had ever heard repeated
almost primitive in their crudity and sim-
plicity and for a moment the sheerest
awe came over him as he realized the
significance of what he listened to

the dryland race today is a handful
of semi-brutes degenerate from the
ages of past time when they were a

mighty people at the apex of an almost
forgotten glory that day is millions of
years gone now too far in the past to
have record save in the vaguest folklore
yet here was a people who spoke the ru-
diments of that races tongue as it must
have been spoken in the races dim be-
ginnings perhaps a million years earlier
even that that immemorial time of their
triumph the reeling of millenniums set
smiths mind awhirl with the effort at
compassing their span

  there was another connotation in the
speaking of that tongue by these timid
bush-dwellers too it must mean that the
forgotten wizard king illar had peopled
his sinister twilight land with the ances-
tors of todays dryland dwellers if they
shared the same tongue they must share
the same lineage and humanitys re-
morseless adaptability had done the rest

  it had been no kinder here than in the
outside world where the ancient plains-
men who had roamed mars green prai-
ries had dwindled with their dying plains
degenerating at last into a shrunken
leather-skinned bestiality for here that
same race root had declined into these
tiny slinking creatures with their dusky
skins and great staring eyes and theic
voices that never rose above a whisper
what tragedies must lie behind that grad-
ual degeneration

  all about him the whispers still ran
he was beginning to suspect that through
countless ages of hiding and murmuring
those voices must have lost the ability to
speak aloud and he wondered with a
little inward chill what terror it was
which had transformed a free and fear-
less people into these tiny wild things
whispering in the underbrush

  the little anxious voices had shrilled
into vehemence now all of them chat-
tering together in their queer soft rust-
ling whispers looking back later upon
that timeless space he had passed in the


weird tales

hollow smith remembered it as some cu-
rious nightmare-dimness and tapestried
blurring and a hush like death over the
whole twilight land and the timid voices
whispering whispering eloquent with
terror and warning

  he groped back among his memories
and brought forth a phrase or two re-
membered from long ago an archaic
rendering of the immemorial tongue they
spoke it was the simplest version he
could remember of the complex speech
now used but he knew that to them it
must sound fantastically strange instinc-
tively he whispered as he spoke it feeling
like an actor in a play as he mouthed the
ancient idiom

  i-i cannot understand speak-
more slowly-

  a torrent of words greeted this render-
ing of their tongue then there was a
great deal of hushing and hissing and
presently two or three between them be-
gan laboriously to recite an involved
speech one syllable at a time always
two or more shared the task never in his
converse with them did he address any-
one directly ages of terror had bred all
directness out of them

  thag they said thag the terrible
-thag the omnipotent-thag the un-
escapable beware of thag

  for a moment smith stood quiet grin-
ning down at them despite himself there
must not be too much of intelligence left
among this branch of the race either for
surely such a warning was superfluous
yet they had mastered their agonies of
timidity to give it all virtue could not
yet have been bred out of them then
they still had kindness and a sort of
desperate courage rooted deep in fear

  what is thag he managed to in-
quire voicing the archaic syllables uncer-
tainly and they must have understood
the meaning if not the phraseology for
another spate of whispered tumult burst

from the clustering tribe then as be-
fore several took up the task of answer-
ing

  thag-thag the end and the begin-
ning the center of creation when thag
breathes the world trembles the earth
was made for thags dwelling-place all
things are thags oh beware beware
this much he pieced together out of
their diffuse whisperings catching up the
fragments of words he knew and fitting
them into the pattern

  what-what is the danger he man-
aged to ask

  thag-hungers thag must be fed
it is we who-feed-him but there are
times when he desires other food than
us it is then he sends his priestess forth
to lure-food-in oh beware of thag
you mean then that she-the priest-
ess-brought me in for-food

  a chorus of grave murmuring affirma-
tives

  then why did she leave me

  there is no escape from thag thag
is the center of creation all things are
thags when he calls you must answer
when he hungers he will have you be-
ware of thag

  smith considered that for a moment in
silence in the main he felt confident
that he had understood their warning cor-
rectly and he had little reason to doubt
that they knew whereof they spoke thag
might not be the center of the universe
but if they said he could call a victim
from anywhere in the land smith was
not disposed to doubt it the priestess
willingness to let him leave her unhin-
dered yes even her scornful laughter as
he looked back told the same story
whatever thag might be his power in
this land could not be doubted he made
up his mind suddenly what he must do
and turned to the breathlessly waiting
little folk

  	which way-lies thag he asked
the tree of life



  a score of dark thin arms pointed
smith turned his head speculatively to-
ward the spot they indicated in this
changeless twilight all sense of direction
had long since left him but he marked
the line as well as he could by the forma-
tion of the trees then turned to the little
people with a ceremonious farewell rising
to his lips

  my thanks for- he began to be

interrupted by a chorus of whispering
cries of protest they seemed to sense
his intention and their pleadings were
frantic a panic anxiety for him glowed
upon every little terrified face turned up
to his and their eyes were wide with pro-
test and terror helplessly he looked
down

  i-i must go he tried stumblingly
to say my only chance is to take thag
unawares before he sends for me

  he could not know if they understood
ttieir chattering went on undiminished
and they even went so far as to lay tiny
hands on him as if they would prevent
him by force from seeking out the terror
of their lives

  no no no they wailed murmurous-
ly you do not know what it is you
seek you do not know thag stay here
beware of thag

a little prickling of unease went

	down smiths back as he listened
thag must be very terrible indeed if even
half this alarm had foundation and to
be quite frank with himself he would
greatly have preferred to remain here in
the hidden quiet of the hollow with its
illusion of shelter for as long as he was
allowed to stay but he was not of the
stuff that yields very easily to its own ter-
rors and hope burned strongly in him
still so he squared his broad shoulders
and turned resolutely in the direction the
tree-folk had indicated

  when they saw that he meant to go

their protests sank to a wail of bitter
grieving with that sound moaning be-
hind him he went up out of the hollow
like a man setting forth to the music of
his own dirge a few of the bravest went
with him a little way flitting through
the underbrush and darting from tree to
tree in a timidity so deeply ingrained that
even when no immediate peril threatened
they dared not go openly through the
twilight

  their presence was comforting to
smith as he went on a futile desire to
help the little terror-ridden tribe was ris-
ing in him a useless gratitude for their
warning and their friendliness their gen-
uine grieving at his departure and their
odd paradoxical bravery even in the
midst of hereditary terror but he knew
that he could do nothing for them when
he was not at all sure he could even save
himself something of their panic had
communicated itself to him and he ad-
vanced with a sinking at the pit of his
stomach fear of the unknown is so poig-
nant a thing feeding on its own terror
that he found his hands beginning to
shake a little and his throat going dry as
he went on

  the rustling and whispering among
the bushes dwindled as his followers one
by one dropped away the bravest staying
the longest but even they failing in cour-
age as smith advanced steadily in that di-
rection from which all their lives they
had been taught to turn their faces pres-
ently he realized that he was alone once
more he went on more quickly anxious
to come face to face with this horror of
the twilight and dispel at least the fear-
fulness of its mystery

  the silence was like death not a
breeze stirred the leaves and the only
sound was his own breathing the heavy
thud of his own heart somehow he felt
sure that he was coming nearer to his
 

weird tales

goal hie hush seemed to confirm it he
loosened the force-gun at his thigh

  in that changeless twilight the ground
was sloping down once more into a
broader hollow he descended slowly
every sense alert for danger not knowing
if thag was beast or human or elemental
visible or invisible the trees were begin-
ning to thin he knew that he had almost
reached his goal

  he paused at the edge of the last line
dt trees a clearing spread out before
him at the bottom of the hollow quiet in
the dim translucent air he could focus
directly upon no outlines anywhere for
the tapestried blurring of the place but
when he saw what stood in the very cen-
ter of the clearing he stopped dead-still
like one turned to stone and a shock of
utter cold went chilling through him
yet he could not have said why

   for in the clearings center stood the
tree of life he had met the symbol too
often in patterns and designs not to rec-
ognize it but here that fabulous thing
was living growing actually springing
up from a rooted firmness in the spangled
grass as any tree might spring yet it
could not be real its thin brown trunk
of no recognizable substance smooth
and gleaming mounted in the traditional
spiral its twelve fantastically curving
branches arched delicately outward from
the central stem it was bare of leaves
no foliage masked the serpentine brown
spiral of the trunk but at the tip of each
symbolic branch flowered a blossom of
bloody rose so vivid he could scarcely fo-
cus his dazzled eyes upon them

   this tree alone of all objects in the dim
land was sharply distinct to the eye-
terribly distinct remorselessly clear no
words can describe the amazing menace
that dwelt among its branches smiths
flesh crept as he stared yet he could not
for all his staring make out why peril was
so eloquent there to all appearances here

stood only a fabulous symbol miraculous-
ly come to life yet danger breathed out
from it so strongly that smith felt the
hair lifting on his neck as he stared

it was no ordinary danger a nameless
choking paralyzed panic was swell-
ing in his throat as he gazed upon the
perilous beauty of the tree somehow
the arches and curves of its branches
seemed to limn a pattern so dreadful that
his heart beat faster as he gazed upon it
but he could not guess why though some-
how the answer was hovering just out of
reach of his conscious mind from that
first glimpse of it his instincts shuddered
like a shying stallion yet reason still
looked in vain for an answer

  nor was the tree merely a vegetable
growth it was alive terribly ominously
alive he could not have said how he
knew that for it stood motionless in its
empty clearing not a branch trembling
yet in its immobility more awfully vital
than any animate thing the very sight
of it woke in smith an insane urging to
flight to put worlds between himself and
this inexplicably dreadful thing

  crazy impulses stirred in his brain
coming to insane birth at the calling of
the trees peril-the desperate need to
shut out the sight of that thing that was
blasphemy to put out his own sight rather
than gaze longer upon the perilous grace
of its branches to slit his own throat that
he might not need to dwell in the same
world which housed so frightful a sight
as the tree

  all this was a mad battering in his
brain the strength of him was enough
to isolate it in a far corner of his con-
sciousness where it seethed and shrieked
half heeded while he turned the cool con-
trol which the space ways life had taught

tion but even so his hand was moist

and shaking on his gun-butt and the
breath rasped in his dry throat

  why-he asked himself in a deter-
mined groping after steadiness-should
the mere sight of a tree even so fabulous
a one as this rouse that insane panic in
the gazer what peril could dwell in-
visibly in a tree so frightful that the liv-
ing horror of it could drive a man mad
with the very fact of its unseen presence
he clenched his teeth hard and stared
resolutely at that terrible beauty in the
clearing fighting down the sick panic
that rose in his throat as his eyes forced
themselves to dwell upon the tree

  gradually the revulsion subsided af-
ter a nightmare of striving he mustered
the strength to force it down far enough
to allow reasons entry once more stern-
ly holding down that frantic terror under
the surface of consciousness he stared
resolutely at the tree and he knew that
this was thag

  it could be nothing else for surely two
such dreadful things could not dwell in
one land it must be thag and he could
understand now the immemorial terror in
which the tree-folk held it but he did
not yet grasp in what way it threatened
them physically the inexplicable dread-
fulness of it was a menace to the minds
very existence but surely a rooted tree
however terrible to look at could wield
little actual danger

  as he reasoned his eyes were seeking
restlessly among the branches searching
for the answer to their dreadfulness
after all this thing wore the aspect of an
old pattern and in that pattern there was
nothing dreadful the tree of life had
made up the design upon that well-top
in illar through whose shadow he had
entered here and nothing in that bronze
grille-work had roused terror then

why- what living menace dwelt

invisibly among these branches to twist
them into curves of horror

  a fragment of old verse drifted
through his mind as he stared in per-
plexity

      what immortal hand or eye
      could frame thy fearful symmetry

  and for the first time the true signifi-
cance of a fearful symmetry broke
upon him truly a more than human
agency must have arched these subtle
curves so delicately into dreadfulness into
sudi an awful beauty that the very sight
of it made those atavistic terrors he was
so sternly holding down leap in a gibber-
ing terror

  a tremor rippled over the tree smith
froze rigid staring with startled eyes no
breath of wind had stirred through the
clearing but the tree was moving with
a slow serpentine grace writhing its
branches leisurely in a horrible travesty
of voluptuous enjoyment and upon
their tips the blood-red flowers were
spreading like cobras hoods swelling
and stretching their petals out and glow-
ing with a hue so eye-piercingly vivid that
it transcended the bounds of color and
blazed forth like pure light

  but it was not toward smith that they
stirred they were arching out from the
central trunk toward the far side of the
clearing after a moment smith tore his
eyes away from the indescribably dread-
ful flexibility of those branches and
looked to see the cause of their writhing

  a blaze of luminous white had ap-
peared among the trees across the clear-
ing the priestess had returned he
watched her pacing slowly toward the
tree walking with a precise and delicate
grace as liquidly lovely as the motion of
the tree her fabulous hair swung down
about her in a swaying robe that rippled
at every step away from the moon-white
beauty of her body straight toward the
tree she paced and all the blossoms
glowed more vividly at her nearness the


weird tales

branches stretching toward her rippling
with eagerness

  priestess though she was he could
not believe that she was going to come
within touch of that tree the very sight
of which roused such a panic instinct
of revulsion in every fiber of him but
she did not swerve or slow in her
advance walking delicately over the
flowery grass arrogantly luminous in
the twilight so that her body was the
center and focus of any landscape she
walked in she neared her horribly
eager god

  now she was under the tree and
its trunk had writhed down over her
and she was lifting her arms like a girl
to her lover with a gliding slowness
the flame-tipped branches slid round
her in that incredible embrace she
stood immobile for a long moment
the tree arching down with all its curl-
ing limbs the girl straining upward her
head thrown back and the mantle of her
hair swinging free of her body as she
lifted her face to the quivering blossoms
the branches gathered her closer in their
embrace now the blossoms arched near
curving down all about her touching
her very gently twisting their blazing
faces toward the focus of her moon-
white body one poised directly above
her face trembled brushed her mouth
lightly and the trees tremor ran un-
broken through the body of the girl it
clasped

the incredible dreadfulness of that
embrace was suddenly more than
smith could bear all his terrors crushed
down with so stem a self-control with-
out warning burst all bounds and rushed
over him in a flood of blind revulsion a
whimper choked up in his throat and
quite involuntarily he swung round and
plunged into the shielding trees hands
to his eyes in a futile effort to blot out

the sight of lovely horror behind him
whose vividness was burnt upon his
very brain

  heedlessly he blundered through the
trees no thought in his terror-blank mind
save the necessity to run run run until
he could run no more he had given
up all attempt at reason and rationality
he no longer cared why the beauty of
the tree was so dreadful he only
knew that until all space lay between
him and its symmetry he must run and
run and run

  what brought that frenzied madness
to an end he never knew when sanity
returned to him he was lying face down
on the flower-spangled sward in a silence
so deep that his ears ached with its
heaviness the grass was cool against
his cheek for a moment he fought the
back-flow of knowledge into his emptied
mind when it came the memory of
that horror he had fled from he started
up with a wild things swiftness and
glared around pale-eyed into the un-
changing dusk he was alone not
even a rustle in the leaves spoke of the
tree-folks presence

  for a moment he stood there alert
wondering what had roused him wonder-
ing what would come next he was not
left long in doubt the answer was
shrilling very very faintly through that
adiing quiet an infinitesimally tiny un-
thinkably far-away murmur which yet
pierced his ear-drums with the sharpness
of tiny needles breathless he strained in
listening swiftly the sound grew louder
it deepened upon the silence sharpened
and shrilled until the thin blade of it was
vibrating in the center of his innermost
brain

  and still it grew swelling louder and
louder through the twilight world in ca-
dences that were rounding into a queer
sort of music and taking on such an un-
bearable sweetness that smith pressed his
the tree of life

hands over his ears in a futile attempt to
shut the sound away he could not it
rang in steadily deepening intensities
through every fiber of his being piercing
him with thousands of tiny music-blades
that quivered in his very soul with intol-
erable beauty and he thought he sensed
in the piercing strength of it a vibration
of queer unnamable power far mightier
than anything ever generated by man the
dim echo of some cosmic dynamos hum

  the sound grew sweeter as it strength-
ened with a queer inexplicable sweetness
unlike any music he had ever heard be-
fore rounder and fuller and more com-
plete than any melody made up of sepa-
rate notes stronger and stronger he felt
the certainty that it was the song of some
mighty power humming and throbbing
and deepening through the twilight until
the whole dim land was one trembling
reservoir of sound that filled his entire
consciousness with its throbbing driving
out all other thoughts and realizations
until he was no more than a shell that
vibrated in answer to the calling

  for it was a calling no one could
listen to that intolerable sweetness with-
out knowing the necessity to seek its
source remotely in the back of his
mind smith remembered the tree-folks
warning when thag calls you must
answer not consciously did he recall it
for all his consciousness was answering
the siren humming in the air and
scarcely realizing that he moved he had
turned toward the source of that calling
stumbling blindly over the flowery sward
with no thought in his music-brimmed
mind but the need to answer that lovely
power-vibrant summoning

  past him as he went on moved other
shapes little and dark-skinned and
ecstatic gripped like himself in the hyp-
notic melody the tree-folk had forgot-
ten even their inbred fear at thags call-

ing and walked boldly through the oped
twilight lost in the wonder of the song

  smith went on with the rest deaf and
blind to the land around him alive to
one thing only that summons from the
siren tune unrealizingly he retraced the
course of his frenzied flight past the trees
and bushes he had blundered through
down the slope that led to the trees
hollow through the thinning of the
underbrush to the very edge of the last
line of foliage which marked the valleys
rim

by now the calling was so unbearably
intense so intolerably sweet that
somehow in its very strength it set free a
part of his dazed mind as it passed the
limits of audible things and soared into
ecstasies which no senses bound and
though it gripped him ever closer in its
magic a sane part of his brain was wak-
ing into realization for the first time
alarm came back into his mind and by
slow degrees the world returned about
him he stared stupidly at the grass
moving by under his pacing feet he
lifted a dragging head and saw that the
trees no longer rose about him that a
twilit clearing stretched away on all sides
toward the forest rim which circled it
that the music was singing from some
source so near that-that-

  the tree terror leaped within him
like a wild thing the tree quivering
with unbearable clarity in the thick dim
air writhed above him blossoms blazing
with bloody radiance and every branch
vibrant and undulant to the tune of that
unholy song then he was aware of the
lovely luminous whiteness of the
priestess swaying forward under the
swaying limbs her hair rippling back
from the loveliness of her as she moved

  choked and frenzied with unreasoning
terror he mustered every effort that was
a

weird tales

in him to turn to run again like a mad-
man out of that dreadful hollow to hide
himself under the weight of all space
from the menace of the tree and all the
while he fought all the while panic
drummed like mad in his brain his re-
lentless body plodded on straight toward
the hideous loveliness of that siren singer
towering above him from the first he
had felt subconsciously that it was thag
who called and now in the very center
of that ocean of vibrant power he knew
gripped in the musics magic he went
on

  all over the clearing other hypnotized
victims were advancing slowly with me-
chanical steps and wide frantic eyes as
the tree-folk came helplessly to their
gods calling he watched a group of
little dusky sacrifices pace step by step
nearer to the trees vibrant branches
the priestess came forward to meet them
with outstretched arms he saw her take
the foremost gently by the hands un-
believing hypnotized with horrified in-
credulity he watched her lead the rigid
little creature forward under the fabulous
tree whose limbs yearned downward like
hungry snakes the great flowers glowing
with avid color

  he saw the branches twist out and
lengthen toward the sacrifice quivering
with eagerness then with a tigers leap
they darted and the victim was swept out
of the priestess guiding hands up into
the branches that darted round like
tangled snakes in a clot that hid him for
an instant from view smith heard a high
shuddering wail ripple out from that knot
of struggling brandies a dreadful cry
that held such an infinity of purest horror
and understanding that he could not but
believe that thags victims in the moment
of their doom must learn the secret of his
horror after that one frightful cry came
silence in an instant the limbs fell apart
again from emptiness the little savage

had melted like smoke among their
writhing too quickly to have been de-
voured more as if he had been snatched
into another dimension in the instant the
hungry limbs hid him flame-tipped
avid they were dipping now toward an-
other victim as the priestess paced serene-
ly forward

  and still smiths rebellious feet were
carrying him on nearer and nearer the
writhing peril that towered over his
head the music shrilled like pain now
he was so close that he could see the
hungry flower-mouths in terrible detail as
they faced round toward him the limbs
quivered and poised like cobras reached
out with a snakish lengthening down in-
exorably toward his shuddering helpless-
ness the priestess was turning her calm
white face toward his

  those arcs and changing curves of the
branches as they neared were sketching
lines of pure horror whose meaning he
still could not understand save that they
deepened in dreadfulness as he neared
for the last time that urgent wonder
burned up in his mind why-why so
simple a thing as this fabulous tree
should be infused with an indwelling ter-
ror strong enough to send his innermost
soul frantic with revulsion for the last
time-because in that trembling instant
as he waited for their touch as the music
brimmed up with unbearable brain-
wrenching intensity in that one last
moment before the flower-mouths seized
him-he saw he understood

  with eyes opened at last by the
instants ultimate horror he saw the real
thag dimly he knew that until now the
tiling had been so frightful that his eyes
had refused to register its existence his
brain to acknowledge the possibility of
sudi dreadfulness it had literally been
too terrible to see though his instinct
knew the presence of infinite horror but
the tree of life



now in the grip of that mad hypnotic
song in the instant before unbearable
terror enfolded him his eyes opened to
full sight and he saw

  that tree was only thags outline
sketched three-dimensionally upon the
twilight its dreadfully curving branches
had been no more than thags barest
contours yet even they had made his
very soul sick with intuitive revulsion
but now seeing the true horror his mind
was too numb to do more than register
its presence thag hovering monstrously
between earth and heaven billowing and
surging up there in the translucent twi-
light tethered to the ground by the
trees bending stem and reaching raven-
ously after the hypnotized fodder that
his calling brought helpless into his
clutches one by one he snatched them
up one by one absorbed them into the
great unseeable horror of his being
that then was the reason why they van-
ished so instantaneously sucked into the
concealing folds of a thing too dreadful
for normal eyes to see

  the priestess was pacing forward
above her the branches arched and
leaned caught in a timeless paralysis of
horror smith stared upward into the
enormous bulk of thag while the music
hummed intolerably in his shrinking
brain-thag the monstrous thing from
darkness called up by illar in those
long-forgotten times when mars was a
green planet foolishly his brain
wandered among the ramifications of
what had happened so long ago that
time itself had forgotten refusing to
recognize the fate that was upon him-
self he knew a tingle of respect for the
ages-dead wizard who had dared com-
mand a being like this to his services-
this vast blind hovering thing ravenous
for human flesh indistinguishable even
now save in those terrible outlines that
sent panic leaping through him with

every motion of the trees fearful
symmetry

  all this flashed through his dazed
mind in the one blinding instant of
understanding then the priestess
luminous whiteness swam up before his
hypnotized stare her hands were upon
him gently guiding his mechanical foot-
steps very gently leading him forward
into-into-

the writhing branches struck down-
ward straight for his face and in
one flashing leap the moments infinite
horror galvanized him out of his paral-
ysis why he could not have said it is
not given to many men to know the
ultimate essentials of all horror concen-
trated into one fundamental unit to
most men it would have had that same
paralyzing effect up to the very instant of
destruction but in smith there must
have been a bed-rock of subtle violence
an unyielding inflexible vehemence upon
which the structure of his whole life was
reared few men have it and when that
ultimate intensity of terror struck the
basic flint of him reaching down through
mind and soul into the deepest depths of
his being it struck a spark from that in-
flexible barbarian buried at the roots of
him which had force enough to shock
him out of his stupor

  in the instant of release his hand
swept like an unloosed spring of its own
volition straight for the butt of his
power-gun he was dragging it free as
the trees branches snatched him from
its priestess hands the fire-colored
blossoms burnt his flesh as they closed
round him the hot branches gripping
like the touch of ravenous fingers the
whole tree was hot and throbbing with
a dreadful travesty of fleshly life as it
whipped him aloft into the hovering bulk
of incarnate horror above


weird tales

  in the instantaneous upward leap of
the flower-tipped limbs smith fought like
a demon to free his gun-hand from the
gripping coils for the first time thag
knew rebellion in his very clutches and
the ecstasy of that music which had
dinned in smiths ears so strongly that
by now it seemed almost silence was
swooping down a long arc into wrath
and the branches tightened with hot in-
sistency lifting the rebellious offering
into thags monstrous indescribable
bulk

   but even as they rose smith was twist-
ing in their clutch to maneuver his hand
into a position from which he could blast
that undulant tree trunk into nothing-
ness he knew intuitively the futility of
firing up into thags imponderable mass
thag was not of the world he knew the
flame blast might well be harmless to
that mighty hoverer in the twilight but
at the trees root where thags essen-
tial being merged from the imponderable
to the material rooting in earthly soil
he should be vulnerable if he were vul-
nerable at all struggling in the tight hot
coils breathing the nameless essence of
horror smith fought to free his hand

  the music that had rung so long in
his ears was changing as the branches
lifted him higher losing its melody and
merging by swift degrees into a hum of
vast and vibrant power that deepened in
intensity as the limbs drew him upward
into thags monstrous bulk the singing
force of a thing mightier than any
dynamo ever built blinded and dazed by
the force thundering through every atom
of his body he twisted his hand in one
last convulsive effort and fired

  he saw the flame leap in a dazzling
gush straight for the trunk below it
struck he heard the sizzle of annihilated
matter he saw the trunk quiver con-
vulsively from the very roots and the

whole fabulous tree shook once with an
ominous tremor but before that tremor
could shiver up the branches to him the
hum of the living dynamo which was
closing round his body shrilled up arcs
of pure intensity into a thundering
silence

  then without a moments warning the
world exploded so instantaneously did
all this happen that the gun-blasts roar
had not yet echoed into silence before a
mightier sound than the brain could
bear exploded outward from the very
center of his own being before the
awful power of it everything reeled into
a shaken oblivion he felt himself
falling   

a queer penetrating light shining
upon his closed eyes roused smith
by degrees into wakefulness again he
lifted heavy lids and stared upward into
the unwinking eye of mars racing nearer
moon he lay there blinking dazedly for
a while before enough of memory re-
turned to rouse him then he sat up
painfully for every fiber of him ached
and stared round on a scene of the wild-
est destruction he lay in the midst of a
wide rough circle which held nothing
but powdered stone about it rising rag-
gedly in the moving moonlight the
blocks of time-forgotten illar loomed

  but they were no longer piled one
upon another in a rough travesty of the
city they once had shaped some force
mightier than any of mans explosives
seemed to have hurled them with sudi
violence from their beds that their very
atoms had been disrupted by the force
of it crumbling them into dust and
in the very center of the havoc lay smith
unhurt

  he stared in bewilderment about the
moonlight ruins in the silence it seemed
to him that the very air still quivered in
the tree of life



shocked vibrations and as he stared he
realized that no force save one could
have wrought such destruction upon the
ancient stones nor was there any explo-
sive known to man which would have
wrought this strange pulverizing havoc
upon the blocks of illar that force had
hummed unbearably through the living
dynamo of thag a force so powerful that
space itself had bent to enclose it sud-
denly he realized what must have
happened

 not mar but thag himself had
warped the walls of space to enfold the
twilit world and nothing but thags
living power could have held it so bent
to segregate the little terror-ridden land
inviolate

  then when the trees roots parted
thags anchorage in the material world
failed and in one great gust of unthink-
able energy the warped space-walls had
ceased to bend those arches of solid
space had snapped back into their
original pattern hurling the land and all

its dwellers into-into- his mind

balked in the effort to picture what must

have happened into what ultimate di-
mension those denizens must have
vanished

  only himself enfolded deep in thags
very essence the intolerable power of the
explosion had not touched so when the
warped space-curve ceased to be and
thags hold upon reality failed he must
have been dropped back out of the dis-
solving folds upon the spot where the
tree had stood in the space-circled world
through that vanished world-floor into
the spot he had been snatched from in
the instant of the dim lands dissolu-
tion it must have happened after the
terrible force of the explosion had spent
itself before thag dared move even him-
self through the walls of changing energy
into his own far land again

  smith sighed and lifted a hand to his
throbbing head rising slowly to his feet
what time had elapsed he could not
guess but he must assume that the patrol
still searched for him wearily he set out
across the circle of havoc toward the
nearest shelter which mar offered the
dust rose in ghostly moonlit clouds under
his feet

one of the strangest stories ever written-the tale of a barbarian adventurer
a woman pirate and a weird roofed city inhabited by the most
peculiar race of men ever spawned

the story thus far

con an the cimmerian and val-
eria a woman pirate having de-
serted from a mercenary army on
the stygian-darfar border came after
many days flight to a vast forest far to
the south there their horses were slain
and devoured by a dragon which conan
managed to kill with a poisoned spear
in a plain surrounded by the forest they
came upon a fantastic city called xuchotl
a series of halls and chambers built all
under one roof floored with a lambent
red stone and illuminated by means of
skylights and green fire-iewels at first it
appeared to be deserted but later they
discovered it to be inhabited by a tribe
of mongrel stygians called tlazitlans
who were divided into rival clans known
as tecuhltii and xotalancas

  valeria saved the life of a tecuhltii
named techotl and with him they fled
to the castle of tecuhltii near the western
gate of the city pursued by the xotal-
ancas who dwelt by the eastern gate
tecuhltii was ruled over by prince olmec
and princess tascela who displayed a
sinister interest in valeria olmec told
the adventurers that half a century ago a
tribe of tlazitlans had fled southward
from the stygians and fought their way
through the dragon-haunted forest and
found the city then occupied by a degen-
erate race which had once been powerful
magicians the tlazitlans had destroyed


them and settled in the city ruled by the
brothers tecuhltii and xotalanc and by
an evil ancient named tolkemec

  a quarrel over a woman had split the
tribe into three clans of which that of
tolkemec had been utterly destroyed
twelve years before tolkemec escaping
supposedly dying from the dungeon
where he was thrown fear of the
dragons in the forest kept the people
imprisoned in the city while the feud
reduced the tribe to a handful on each
side

  red nails driven in an ebon column
denoted the number of xotalancas slain
in the feud olmec persuaded conan
and valeria to remain and fight for his
clan as mercenaries they were shown
to separate chambers and valeria awoke
during the night to find yasala tascelas
maid trying to drug her with the black
lotus she tried to make the girl explain
her actions but yasala fleeing from her
ran down a stair leading to the catacombs
beneath the city into which old tolkemec
had dragged his broken body twelve years
before valeria heard her scream down
in the darkness and heard an inhuman
high-pitched tittering returning to her
chamber she secured her garments and
weapons meaning to urge conan to join
her in flight from the city she had begun
to fear but just as she started for his
chamber she heard a sudden clamor of
yells and the clash of swords

  the story continues
red nails



	twenty red nails

two warriors lounged in the guard-
room on the floor known as the tier
of the eagle their attitude was casual
though habitually alert an attack on
the great bronze door from without was
always a possibility but for many years
no such assault had been attempted on
either side

  the strangers are strong allies said
one olmec will move against the
enemy tomorrow i believe

he spoke as a soldier in a war might

have spoken in the miniature world of
xuchotl each handful of feudists was an
army and the empty halls between the
castles was the country over which they
campaigned

  the other meditated for a space

  suppose with their aid we destroy
xotalanc he said what then
xatmec

  why returned xatmec we will
drive red nails for them all the cap-
tives we will burn and flay and quarter

  but afterward pursued the other
after we have slain them all will it

xten as he shifted he harled the knife
 

weird tales

not seem strange to have no foes to
fight all my life i have fought and
hated the xotalancas with the feud
ended what is left

  xatmec shrugged his shoulders his
thoughts had never gone beyond the
destruction of their foes they could not
go beyond that

  suddenly both men stiffened at a noise
outside the door

  to the door xatmec hissed the
last speaker i shall look through the
eye-

  xatmec sword in hand leaned against
the bronze door straining his ear to hear
through the metal his mate looked into
the mirror he started convulsively men
were clustered thickly outside the door
grim dark-faced men with swords
gripped in their teeth-and their fingers
thrust into their ears one who wore a
feathered head-dress had a set of pipes
which he set to his lips and even as
the tecuhltli started to shout a warning
the pipes began to skirl

  the cry died in the guards throat as
the thin weird piping penetrated the
metal door and smote on his ears xatmec
leaned frozen against the door as if
paralyzed in that position his face was
that of a wooden image his expression
one of horrified listening the other
guard farther removed from the source
of the sound yet sensed the horror of
what was taking place the grisly threat
that lay in that demoniac fifing he
felt the weird strains plucking like un-
seen fingers at the tissues of his brain
filling him with alien emotions and im-
pulses of madness but with a soul-tear-
ing effort he broke the spell and
shrieked a warning in a voice he did not
recognize as his own

  but even as he cried out the music
changed to an unbearable shrilling that
was like a knife in the ear-drums xatmec
screamed in sudden agony and all the

sanity went out of his face like a flame
blown out in a wind like a madman he
ripped loose the chain tore open the door
and rushed out into the hail sword lifted
before his mate could stop him a dozen
blades struck him down and over his
mangled body the xotalancas surged into
the guardroom with a long-drawn
blood-mad yell that sent the unwonted
echoes reverberating

  his brain reeling from the shock of
it all the remaining guard leaped to meet
them with goring spear the horror of
the sorcery he had just witnessed was
submerged in the stunning realization
that the enemy were in tecuhltli and
as his spearhead ripped through a dark-
skinned belly he knew no more for a
swinging sword crushed his skull even as
wild-eyed warriors came pouring in from
the chambers behind the guardroom

  it was the yelling of men and the
clanging of steel that brought conan
bounding from his couch wide awake
and broadsword in hand in an instant
he had reached the door and flung it
open and was glaring out into the corri-
dor just as techotl rushed up it eyes
blazing madly

  the xotalancas he screamed in a
voice hardly human they are within
the door

  conan ran down the corridor even as
valeria emerged from her chamber

   what the devil is it she called

  techotl says the xotalancas are inr
he answered hurriedly that racket
sounds like it

with the tecuhltli on their heels
they burst into the throneroom and
were confronted by a scene beyond the
most frantic dream of blood and fury
twenty men and women their black hair
streaming and the white skulls gleaming
on their breasts were locked in combat
with the people of tecuhltli the women

                     w t-

on both sides fought as madly as the men
and already the room and the hall be-
yond were strewn with corpses

  olmec naked but for a breech-clout
was fighting before his throne and as the
adventurers entered tascela ran from an
inner chamber with a sword in her hand

  xatmec and his mate were dead so
there was none to tell the tecuhltii how
their foes had found their way into their
citadel nor was there any to say what
had prompted that mad attempt but the
losses of the xotalancas had been greater
their position more desperate than the
tecuhltii had known the maiming of
their scaly ally the destruction of the
burning skull and the news gasped by
a dying man that mysterious white-
skin allies had joined their enemies had
driven them to the frenzy of desperation
and the wild determination to die dealing
death to their ancient foes

  the tecuhltii recovering from the first
stunning shock of the surprize that had
swept them back into the throneroom
and littered the floor with their corpses
fought back with an equally desperate
fury while the door-guards from the
lower floors came racing to hurl them-
selves into the fray it was the death-
fight of rabid wolves blind panting
merciless back and forth it surged from
door to dais blades whickering and strik-
ing into flesh blood spurting feet stamp-
ing the crimson floor where redder pools
were forming ivory tables crashed over
seats were splintered velvet hangings
torn down were stained red it was the
bloody climax of a bloody half-century
and every man there sensed it

  but the conclusion was inevitable the
tecuhltii outnumbered the invaders al-
most two to one and they were heartened
by that fact and by the entrance into the
melee of their light-skinned allies

  these crashed into the fray with the
devastating effect of a hurricane plowing
w t-

through a grove of saplings in sheer
strength no three tlazitlans were a match
for conan and in spite of his weight he
was quicker on his feet than any of
them he moved through the whirling
eddying mass with the surety and de-
structiveness of a gray wolf amidst a pack
of alley curs and he strode over a wake
of crumpled figures

  valeria fought beside him her lips
smiling and her eyes blazing she was
stronger than the average man and far
quicker and more ferocious her sword
was like a living thing in her hand
where conan beat down opposition by
the sheer weight and power of his blows
breaking spears splitting skulls and cleav-
ing bosoms to the breastbone valeria
brought into action a finesse of sword-
play that dazzled and bewildered her an-
tagonists before it slew them again and
again a warrior heaving high his heavy
blade found her point in his jugular be-
fore he could strike conan towering
above the field strode through the wel-
ter smiting right and left but valeria
moved like an illusive phantom con-
stantly shifting and thrusting and slash-
ing as she shifted swords missed her
again and again as the wielders flailed
the empty air and died with her point in
their hearts or throats and her mocking
laughter in their ears

  neither sex nor condition was consid-
ered by the maddened combatants the
five women of the xotalancas were down
with their throats cut before conan and
valeria entered the fray and when a man
or woman went down under the stamping
feet there was always a knife ready for
the helpless throat or a sandaled foot
eager to crush the prostrate skull

  from wall to wall from door to door
rolled the waves of combat spilling over
into adjoining chambers and presently
only tecuhltii and their white-skinned
allies stood upright in the great throne-
weird tales

room the survivors stared bleakly and
blankly at each other like survivors after
judgment day or the destruction of the
world on legs wide-braced hands grip-
ping notched and dripping swords blood
trickling down their arms they stared at
one another across the mangled corpses
of friends and foes they had no breath
left to shout but a bestial mad howling
rose from their lips it was not a human
cry of triumph it was the howling of a
rabid wolf-pack stalking among the bod-
ies of its victims

  conan caught valerias arm and turned
her about

  youve got a stab in the calf of your
leg he growled

  she glanced down for the first time
aware of a stinging in the muscles of her
leg some dying man on the floor had
fleshed his dagger with his last effort

  you look like a butcher yourself she
laughed

  he shook a red shower from his hands

  not mine oh a scratch here and
there nothing to bother about but that
calf ought to be bandaged

olmec came through the litter look-
ing like a ghoul with his naked mas-
sive shoulders splashed with blood and
his black beard dabbled in crimson his
eyes were red like the reflection of flame
on black water

  we have won he croaked dazedly
the feud is ended the dogs of xota-
lanc lie dead oh for a captive to flay
ialive yet it is good to look upon their
dead faces twenty dead dogs twenty
red nails for the black column

  youd best see to your wounded
grunted conan turning away from him
here girl let me see that leg

  wait a minute she shook him off
impatiently the fire of fighting still
burned brightly in her soul how do

we know these are all of them these
might have come on a raid of their own

  they would not split the clan on a
foray like this said olmec shaking his
head and regaining some of his ordinary
intelligence without his purple robe the
man seemed less like a prince than some
repellent beast of prey i will stake my
head upon it that we have slain them all
there were less of them than i dreamed
and they must have been desperate but
how came they in tecuhldi

  tascela came forward wiping her
sword on her naked thigh and holding
in her other hand an object she had taken
from the body of the feathered leader of
the xotalancas

  the pipes of madness she said a
warrior tells me that xatmec opened the
door to the xotalancas and was cut down
as they stormed into the guardroom this
warrior came to the guardroom from the
inner hall just in time to see it happen
and to hear the last of a weird strain of
music which froze his very soul tolke-
mec used to talk of these pipes which the
xuchotlans swore were hidden some-
where in the catacombs with the bones
of the ancient wizard who used them in
his lifetime somehow the dogs of xota-
lanc found them and learned their se-
cret

  somebody ought to go to xotalanc
and see if any remain alive said conan
ill go if somebody will guide me

  olmec glanced at the remnants of his
people there were only twenty left
alive and of these several lay groaning
on the floor tascela was the only one of
the tecuhldi who had escaped without
a wound the princess was untouched
though she had fought as savagely as any

  who will go with conan to xota-
lanc asked olmec

  techotl limped forward the wound
red nails

in his thigh had started bleeding afresh
and he had another gash across his ribs

  i will go

  no you wont vetoed conan and
youre not going either valeria in a lit-
tle while that leg will be getting stiff

  i will go volunteered a warrior who
was knotting a bandage about a slashed
forearm

  very well yanath go with the cim-
merian and you too topal olmec
indicated another man whose injuries
were slight but first aid us to lift the
badly wounded on these couches where
we may bandage their hurts

  this was done quickly as they stooped
to pick up a woman who had been
stunned by a war-club olmecs beard
brushed topals ear conan thought the
prince muttered something to the war-
rior but he could not be sure a few
moments later he was leading his com-
panions down the hall

  conan glanced back as he went out the
door at that shambles where the dead
lay on the smoldering floor blood-stained
dark limbs knotted in attitudes of fierce
muscular effort dark faces frozen in
masks of hate glassy eyes glaring up at
the green fire-jewels which bathed the
ghastly scene in a dusky emerald witch-
light among the dead the living moved
aimlessly like people moving in a trance
conan heard olmec call a woman and di-
rect her to bandage valerias leg the
pirate followed the woman into an ad-
joining chamber already beginning to
limp slightly

warily the two tecuhltli led conan
along the hall beyond the bronze
door and through chamber after cham-
ber shimmering in the green fire they
saw no one heard no sound after they
crossed the great hall which bisected the
city from north to south their caution
was increased by the realization of their

nearness to enemy territory but cham-
bers and halls lay empty to their wary
gaze and they came at last along a broad
dim hallway and halted before a bronze
door similar to the eagle door of tecuhl-
tli gingerly they tried it and it opened
silently under their fingers awed they
stared into the green-lit chambers beyond
for fifty years no tecuhltli had entered
those halls save as a prisoner going to a
hideous doom to go to xotalanc had
been the ultimate horror that could befall
a man of the western castle the terror
of it had stalked through their dreams
since earliest childhood to yanath and
topal that bronze door was like the por-
tal of hell

  they cringed back unreasoning horror
in their eyes and conan pushed past
them and strode into xotalanc

  timidly they followed him as each
man set foot over the threshold he stared
and glared wildly about him but only
their quick hurried breathing disturbed
the silence

  they had come into a square guard-
room like that behind the eagle door of
tecuhltli and similarly a hall ran away
from it to a broad chamber that was a
counterpart of olmecs throneroom

  conan glanced down the hall with its
rugs and divans and hangings and stood
listening intently he heard no noise and
the rooms had an empty feel he did not
believe there were any xotalancas left
alive in xuchotl

  come on he muttered and started
down the hall

  he had not gone far when he was
aware that only yanath was following
him he wheeled back to see topal
standing in an attitude of horror one arm
out as if to fend off some threatening
peril his distended eyes fixed with hyp-
notic intensity on something protruding
from behind a divan

  what the devil then conan saw
weird tales

what topal was staring at and he felt a
faint twitching of the skin between his
giant shoulders a monstrous head pro-
truded from behind the divan a reptilian
head broad as the head of a crocodile
with down-curving fangs that projected
over the lower jaw but there was an un-
natural limpness about the thing and the
hideous eyes were glazed

  conan peered behind the couch it
was a great serpent which lay there limp
in death but such a serpent as he had
never seen in his wanderings the reek
and chill of the deep black earth were
about it and its color was an indetermi-
nable hue which changed with each new
angle from which he surveyed it a great
wound in the neck showed what had
caused its death

  it is the crawler whispered yanath

  its the thing i slashed on the stair
grunted conan after it trailed us to
the eagle door it dragged itself here to
die how could the xotalancas control
such a brute

  the tecuhltli shivered and shook their
heads

  they brought it up from the black
tunnels below the catacombs they dis-
covered secrets unknown to tecuhltli

  well its dead and if theyd had any
more of them theyd have brought them
along when they came to tecuhltli come
on

  they crowded close at his heels as he
strode down the hall and thrust on the
silver-worked door at the other end

  if we dont find anybody on this
floor he said well descend into the
lower floors well explore xotalanc
from the roof to the catacombs if xota-
lanc is like tecuhltli all the rooms and
halls in this tier will be lighted-what
the devil

  they had come into the broad throne-
chamber so similar to that one in te-
cuhltli there were the same jade dais

and ivory seat the same divans rugs and
hangings on the walls no black red-
scarred column stood behind the throne-
dais but evidences of the grim feud were
not lacking

  ranged along the wall behind the dais
were rows of glass-covered shelves and
on those shelves hundreds of human
heads perfectly preserved stared at the
startled watchers with emotionless eyes as
they had stared for only the gods knew
how many months and years

topal muttered a curse but yanath
stood silent the mad light growing
in his wide eyes conan frowned know-
ing that tlazitlan sanity was hung on a
hair-trigger

   suddenly yanath pointed to the ghastly
relics with a twitching finger

  there is my brothers head he mur-
mured and there is my fathers younger
brother and there beyond them is my
sisters eldest son

  suddenly he began to weep dry-eyed
with harsh loud sobs that shook his
frame he did not take his eyes from the
heads his sobs grew shriller changed to
frightful high-pitched laughter and that
in turn became an unbearable screaming
yanath was stark mad

   conan laid a hand on his shoulder and
as if the touch had released all the frenzy
in his soul yanath screamed and whirled
striking at the cimmerian with his sword
conan parried the blow and topal tried
to catch yanaths arm but the madman
avoided him and with froth flying from
his lips he drove his sword deep into
topals body topal sank down with a
groan and yanath whirled for an instant
like a crazy dervish then he ran at the
shelves and began hacking at the glass
with his sword screeching blasphemously

  conan sprang at him from behind try-
ing to catch him unaware and disarm him
but the madman wheeled and lunged at
red nails



him screaming like a lost soul realizing
that the warrior was hopelessly insane the
cimmerian side-stepped and as the ma-
niac went past he swung a cut that sev-
ered the shoulder-bone and breast and
dropped the man dead beside his dying
victim

  conan bent over topal seeing that the
man was at his last gasp it was useless
to seek to standi the blood gushing from
the horrible wound

  youre done for topal grunted co-
nan any word you want to send to
your people

  bend closer gasped topal and co-
nan complied-and an instant later
caught the mans wrist as topal struck
at his breast with a dagger

  crom swore conan are you mad
too

  olmec ordered it gasped the dying
man i know not why as we lifted the
wounded upon the couches he whispered
to me bidding me to slay you as we re-
turned to tecuhltii- and with the

name of his clan on his lips topal died

  conan scowled down at him in puzzle-
ment this whole affair had an aspect
of lunacy was olmec mad too were
all the tecuhltii madder than he had real-
ized with a shrug of his shoulders he
strode down the hall and out of the
bronze door leaving the dead tecuhltii
lying before the staring dead eyes of their
kinsmens heads

  conan needed no guide back through
the labyrinth they had traversed his
primitive instinct of direction led him un-
erringly along the route they had come
he traversed it as warily as he had be-
fore his sword in his hand and his eyes
fiercely searching each shadowed nook
and corner for it was his former allies
he feared now not the ghosts of the slain
xotalancas

  he had crossed the great hall and en-
tered the chambers beyond when he heard

something moving ahead of him-some-
thing which gasped and panted and
moved with a strange floundering scram-
bling noise a moment later conan saw
a man crawling over the flaming floor to-
ward him-a man whose progress left a
broad bloody smear on the smoldering
surface it was techotl and his eyes were
already glazing from a deep gash in his
breast blood gushed steadily between the
fingers of his clutching hand with the
other he clawed and hitched himself
along

  conan he cried chokingly co-
nan olmec has taken the yellow-haired
woman

  so thats why he told topal to kih
me murmured conan dropping to his
knee beside the man who his experienced
eye told him was dying olmec isnt so
mad as i thought

  techotls groping fingers plucked at
conans arm in the cold loveless and
altogether hideous life of the tecuhltii
his admiration and affection for the in-
vaders from the outer world formed a
warm human oasis constituted a tie that
connected him with a more natural hu-
manity that was totally lacking in his fel-
lows whose only emotions were hate lust
and the urge of sadistic cruelty

  i sought to oppose him gurgled
techotl blood bubbling frothily to his
lips but he struck me down he
thought he had slain me but i crawled
away ah set how far i have crawled
in my own blood beware conan ol-
mec may have set an ambush for your re-
turn slay olmec he is a beast take
valeria and flee fear not to traverse the
forest olmec and tascela lied about the
dragons they slew each other years ago
all save the strongest for a dozen years
there has been only one dragon if you
have slain him there is naught in the for-
est to harm you he was the god olmec
worshipped and olmec fed human sacri-
weird tales

fices to him the very old and the very
young bound and hurled from the wall-
hasten olmec has taken valeria to the

chamber of the-

- his head slumped down and he was
dead before it came to rest on the floor

conan sprang up his eyes like live
coals so that was olmecs game
having first used the strangers to destroy
his foes he should have known that
something of the sort would be going on
in that black-bearded degenerates mind

  the cimmerian started toward tecuhl-
tli with reckless speed rapidly he reck-
oned the numbers of his former allies
only twenty-one counting olmec had
survived that fiendish battle in the throne-
room three had died since which left
seventeen enemies with which to reckon
in his rage conan felt capable of account-
ing for the whole clan single-handed

  but the innate craft of the wilderness
rose to guide his berserk rage he re-
membered techotls warning of an am-
bush it was quite probable that the
prince would make such provisions on
the chance that topal might have failed
to carry out his order olmec would be
expecting him to return by the same route
he had followed in going to xotalanc

  conan glanced up at a skylight under
whidi he was passing and caught the
blurred glimmer of stars they had not
yet begun to pale for dawn the events
of the night had been crowded into a
comparatively short space of time

  he turned aside from his direct course
and descended a winding staircase to the
floor below he did not know where the
door was to be found that let into the
castle on that level but he knew he could
find it how he was to force the locks he
did not know he believed that the doors
of tecuhltli would all be locked and
bolted if for no other reason than the

habits of half a century but there was
nothing else but to attempt it

  sword in hand he hurried noiselessly on
through a maze of green-lit or shadowy
rooms and halls he knew he must be
near tecuhltli when a sound brought
him up short he recognized it for what
it was-a human being trying to cry out
through a stifling gag it came from
somewhere ahead of him and to the left
in those deathly-still chambers a small
sound carried a long way

  conan turned aside and went seeking
after the sound which continued to be re-
peated presently he was glaring through
a doorway upon a weird scene in the
room into which he was looking a low
rack-like frame of iron lay on the floor
and a giant figure was bound prostrate
upon it his head rested on a bed of
iron spikes which were already crimson-
pointed with blood where they had
pierced his scalp a peculiar harness-like
contrivance was fastened about his head
though in such a manner that the leather
band did not protect his scalp from the
spikes this harness was connected by a
slender chain to the mechanism that up-
held a huge iron ball which was sus-
pended above the captives hairy breast
as long as the man could force himself
to remain motionless the iron ball hung
in its place but when the pain of the
iron points caused him to lift his head
the ball lurched downward a few inches
presently his adiing neck muscles would
no longer support his head in its unnatu-
ral position and it would fall back on the
spikes again it was obvious that eventu-
ally the ball would crush him to a pulp
slowly and inexorably the victim was
gagged and above the gag his great black
ox-eyes rolled wildly toward the man in
the doorway who stood in silent amaze-
ment the man on the rack was olmec
prince of tecuhltli
red nails



	the byes of tascela

hy did you bring me into this
chamber to bandage my legs
demanded valeria couldnt you have
done it just as well in the throneroom
she sat on a couch with her wounded
leg extended upon it and the tecuhltli
woman had just bound it with silk ban-
dages valerias red-stained sword lay on
the couch beside her

  she frowned as she spoke the woman
had done her task silently and efficiently
but valeria liked neither the lingering
caressing touch of her slim fingers nor
the expression in her eyes

  they have taken the rest of the
wounded into the other chambers an-
swered the woman in the soft speech of
the tecuhltli women which somehow did
not suggest either softness or gentleness
in the speakers a little while before va-
leria had seen this same woman stab a
xotalanca woman through the breast and
stamp the eyeballs out of a wounded
xotalanca man

  they will be carrying the corpses of
the dead down into the catacombs she
added lest the ghosts escape into the
chambers and dwell there

  do you believe in ghosts asked va-
leria

  i know the ghost of tolkemec dwells
in the catacombs she answered with a
shiver once i saw it as i crouched in
a crypt among the bones of a dead queen
it passed by in the form of an ancient
man with flowing white beard and locks
and luminous eyes that blazed in the
darkness it was tolkemec i saw him
living when i was a child and he was be-
ing tortured

  her voice sank to a fearful whisper
olmec laughs but i know tolkemecs
ghost dwells in the catacombs they say
it is rats which gnaw the flesh from the

  bones of the newly dead-but ghosts eat
flesh who knows but that-

  she glanced up quickly as a shadow
fell across the couch valeria looked up
to see olmec gazing down at her the
prince had cleansed his hands torso and
beard of the blood that had splashed
them but he had not donned his robe
and his great dark-skinned hairless body
and limbs renewed the impression of
strength bestial in its nature his deep
black eyes burned with a more elemental
light and there was the suggestion of a
twitching in the fingers that tugged at his
thick blue-black beard

  he stared fixedly at the woman and
she rose and glided from the chamber
as she passed through the door she cast
a look over her shoulder at valeria a
glance full of cynical derision and ob-
scene mockery

  she has done a clumsy job criticized
the prince coming to the divan and bend-
ing over the bandage let me see-

  with a quickness amazing in one of
his bulk he snatched her sword and threw
it across the chamber his next move was
to catch her in his giant arms

  quick and unexpected as the move was
she almost matched it for even as he
grabbed her her dirk was in her hand and
she stabbed murderously at his throat
more by luck than skill he caught her
wrist and then began a savage wrestling-
match she fought him with fists feet
knees teeth and nails with all the
strength of her magnificent body and all
the knowledge of hand-to-hand fighting
she had acquired in her years of roving
and fighting on sea and land it availed
her nothing against his brute strength
she lost her dirk in the first moment of
contact and thereafter found herself
powerless to inflict any appreciable pain
on her giant attacker

  the blaze in his weird black eyes did
not alter and their expression filled her


weird tales

  with fury fanned by the sardonic smile
that seemed carved upon his bearded lips
those eyes and that smile contained all
the cruel cynicism that seethes below the
surface of a sophisticated and degenerate
race and for the first time in her life va-
leria experienced fear of a man it was
like struggling against some huge elemen-
tal force his iron arms thwarted her ef-
forts with an ease that sent panic racing
through her limbs he seemed impervi-
ous to any pain she could inflict only
once when she sank her white teeth sav-
agely into his wrist so that the blood
started did he react and that was to
buffet her brutally upon the side of the
head with his open hand so that stars
flashed before her eyes and her head
rolled on her shoulders

  her shirt had been tom open in the
struggle and with cynical cruelty he
rasped his thick beard across her bare
breasts bringing the blood to suffuse the
fair skin and fetching a cry of pain and
outraged fury from her her convulsive
resistance was useless she was crushed
down on a couch disarmed and panting
her eyes blazing up at him like the eyes
of a trapped tigress

  a moment later he was hurrying from
the chamber carrying her in his arms
she made no resistance but the smolder-
ing of her eyes showed that she was un-
conquered in spirit at least she had not
cried out she knew that conan was not
within call and it did not occur to her
that any in tecuhltii would oppose their
prince but she noticed that olmec went
stealthily with his head on one side as if
listening for sounds of pursuit and he
did not return to the throne chamber he
carried her through a door that stood op-
posite that through which he had entered
crossed another room and began stealing
down a hall as she became convinced
that he feared some opposition to the ab-

  duction she threw back her head and
screamed at the top of her lusty voice

  she was rewarded by a slap that half
stunned her and olmec quickened his
pace to a shambling run

  but her cry had been echoed and twist-
ing her head about valeria through the
tears and stars that partly blinded her
saw techotl limping after them

  olmec turned with a snarl shifting the
woman to an uncomfortable and certainly
undignified position under one huge arm
where he held her writhing and kicking
vainly like a child

  olmec protested techotl you can-
not be such a dog as to do this thing she
is conans woman she helped us slay
the xotalancas and-

without a word olmec balled his
free hand into a huge fist and
stretched the wounded warrior senseless
at his feet stooping and hindered not
at all by the struggles and imprecations
of his captive he drew techotls sword
from its sheath and stabbed the warrior
in the breast then casting aside the wea-
pon he fled on along the corridor he
did not see a womans dark face peer cau-
tiously after him from behind a hang-
ing it vanished and presently techotl
groaned and stirred rose dazedly and
staggered drunkenly away calling co-
nans name

  olmec hurried on down the corridor
and descended a winding ivory staircase
he crossed several corridors and halted at
last in a broad chamber whose doors were
veiled with heavy tapestries with one ex-
ception-a heavy bronze door similar to
the door of the eagle on the upper floor

  he was moved to rumble pointing to
it that is one of the outer doors of
tecuhltii for the first time in fifty years
it is unguarded we need not guard it
now for xotalanc is no more
red nails



  thanks to conan and me you bloody
rogue sneered valeria trembling with
fury and the shame of physical coercion
you treacherous dog conan will cut
your throat for this

  olmec did not bother to voice his be-
lief that conans own gullet had already
been severed according to his whispered
command he was too utterly cynical to
be at all interested in her thoughts or
opinions his flame-lit eyes devoured her
dwelling burningly on the generous ex-
panses of clear white flesh exposed where
her shirt and breeches had been torn in
the struggle

  forget conan he said thickly ol-
mec is lord of xuchotl xotalanc is no
more there will be no more fighting
we shall spend our lives in drinking and
love-making first let us drink

  he seated himself on an ivory table
and pulled her down on his knees like a
dark-skinned satyr with a white nymph in
his arms ignoring her un-nymphlike pro-
fanity he held her helpless with one
great arm about her waist while the other
reached across the table and secured a
vessel of wine

  drink he commanded forcing it to
her lips as she writhed her head away

  the liquor slopped over stinging her
lips splashing down on her naked breasts

  your guest does not like your wine
olmec spoke a cool sardonic voice

  olmec stiffened fear grew in his flam-
ing eyes slowly he swung his great head
about and stared at tascela who posed
negligently in the curtained doorway
one hand on her smooth hip valeria
twisted herself about in his iron grip and
when she met the burning eyes of tas-
cela a chill tingled along her supple
spine new experiences were flooding
valerias proud soul that night recently
she had learned to fear a man now she
knew what it was to fear a woman

  olmec sat motionless a gray pallor

growing under his swarthy skin tascela
brought her other hand from behind her
and displayed a small gold vessel

  i feared she would not like your wine
olmec purred the princess so i
brought some of mine some i brought
with me long ago from the shores of lake
zuad-do you understand olmec

  beads of sweat stood out suddenly on
olmecs brow his muscles relaxed and
valeria broke away and put the table be-
tween them but though reason told her
to dart from the room some fascination
she could not understand held her rigid
watching the scene

  tascela came toward the seated prince
with a swaying undulating walk that was
mockery in itself her voice was soft
slurringly caressing but her eyes gleamed
her slim fingers stroked his beard lightly
you are selfish olmec she crooned
smiling you would keep our hand-
some guest to yourself though you knew
i wished to entertain her you are much
at fault olmec

  the mask dropped for an instant her
eyes flashed her face was contorted and
with an appalling show of strength her
hand locked convulsively in his beard and
tore out a great handful this evidence
of unnatural strength was no more terri-
fying than the momentary baring of the
hellish fury that raged under her bland
exterior

  olmec lurched up widi a roar and
stood swaying like a bear his mighty
hands clenching and unclenching

  slut his booming voice filled the
room witch she-devil tecuhltli
should have slain you fifty years ago be-
gone i have endured too much from you
this white-skinned wench is mine get
hence before i slay you

  the princess laughed and dashed the
blood-stained strands into his face her
laughter was less merciful than the ring
of flint on steel

weird tales

  once you spoke otherwise olmec
she taunted once in your youth you
spoke words of love aye you were my
lover once years ago and because you
loved me you slept in my arms beneath
the enchanted lotus-and thereby put into
my hands the chains that enslaved you
you know you cannot withstand me you
know i have but to gaze into your eyes
with the mystic power a priest of stygia
taught me long ago and you are power-
less you remember the night beneath
the black lotus that waved above us
stirred by no worldly breeze you scent
again the unearthly perfumes that stole
and rose like a cloud about you to enslave
you you cannot fight against me you
are my slave as you were that night-as
you shall be so long as you shall live
olmec of xuchotl

her voice had sunk to a murmur like
the rippling of a stream running
through starlit darkness she leaned close
to the prince and spread her long taper-
ing fingers upon his giant breast his
eyes glazed his great hands fell limply
to his sides

  with a smile of cruel malice tascela
lifted the vessel and placed it to his lips

  drink

  mechanically the prince obeyed and
instantly the glaze passed from his eyes
and they were flooded with fury compre-
hension and an awful fear his mouth
gaped but no sound issued for an in-
stant he reeled on buckling knees and
then fell in a sodden heap on the floor

  his fall jolted valeria out of her pa-
ralysis she turned and sprang toward the
door but with a movement that would
have shamed a leaping panther tascela
was before her valeria struck at her with
her clenched fist and all the power of her
supple body behind the blow it would
have stretched a man senseless on the
floor but with a lithe twist of her torso

tascela avoided the blow and caught the
pirates wrist the next instant valerias
left hand was imprisoned and holding
her wrists together with one hand tas-
cela calmly bound them with a cord she
drew from her girdle valeria thought
she had tasted the ultimate in humilia-
tion already that night but her shame at
being manhandled by olmec was nothing
to the sensations that now shook her sup-
ple frame valeria had always been in-
clined to despise the other members of
her sex and it was overwhelming to en-
counter another woman who could handle
her like a child she scarcely resisted at
all when tascela forced her into a chair
and drawing her bound wrists down be-
tween her knees fastened them to the
chair

  casually stepping over olmec tascela
walked to the bronze door and shot the
bolt and threw it open revealing a hall-
way without

  opening upon this hall she re-
marked speaking to her feminine captive
for the first time there is a chamber
which in old times was used as a torture
room when we retired into tecuhltli
we brought most of the apparatus with
us but there was one piece too heavy to
move it is still in working order i think
it will be quite convenient now

  an understanding flame of terror rose
in olmecs eyes tascela strode back to
him bent and gripped him by the hair

  he is only paralyzed temporarily
she remarked conversationally he can
hear think and feel-aye he can feel
very well indeed

  with which sinister observation she
started toward the door dragging the
giant bulk with an ease that made the
pirates eyes dilate she passed into the
hall and moved down it without hesita-
tion presently disappearing with her cap-
tive into a chamber that opened into it
red nails



and whence shortly thereafter issued the
clank of iron

  valeria swore softly and tugged vain-
ly with her legs braced against the chair
the cords that confined her were appar-
ently unbreakable

  tascela presently returned alone be-
hind her a muffled groaning issued from
the chamber she closed the door but did
not bolt it tascela was beyond the grip
of habit as she was beyond the touch of
other human instincts and emotions

  valeria sat dumbly watching the wo-
man in whose slim hands the pirate
realized her destiny now rested

  tascela grasped her yellow locks and
forced back her head looking imperson-
ally down into her face but the glitter
in her dark eyes was not impersonal

  i have chosen you for a great honor
she said you shall restore the youth of
tascela oh you stare at that my ap-
pearance is that of youth but through
my veins creeps the sluggish chill of ap-
proaching age as i have felt it a thousand
times before i am old so old i do not
remember my childhood but i was a
girl once and a priest of stygia loved me
and gave me the secret of immortality
and youth everlasting he died then-
some said by poison but i dwelt in my
palace by the shores of lake zuad and
the passing years touched me not so at
last a king of stygia desired me and my
people rebelled and brought me to this
land olmec called me a princess i am
not of royal blood i am greater than a
princess i am tascela whose youth your
own glorious youth shall restore

  valerias tongue clove to the roof of
her mouth she sensed here a mystery
darker than the degeneracy she had an-
ticipated

  the taller woman unbound the aqui-
lonians wrists and pulled her to her feet
it was not fear of the dominant strength
that lurked in the princess limbs that

made valeria a helpless quivering cap-
tive in her hands it was the burning
hypnotic terrible eyes of tascela

	he comes from the dark

ell im a kushite

  conan glared down at the man
on the iron rack

  what the devil are you doing on that
thing

  incoherent sounds issued from behind
the gag and conan bent and tore it away
evoking a bellow of fear from the cap-
tive for his action caused the iron ball
to lurch down until it nearly touched the
broad breast

  be careful for sets sake begged
olmec

  what for demanded conan do
you think i care what happens to you i
only wish i had time to stay here and
watch that chunk of iron grind your guts
out but im in a hurry wheres va-
leria

  loose me urged olmec i will
tell you all

  tell me first

  never the princes heavy jaws set
stubbornly

  all right conan seated himself on
a near-by bench ill find her myself
after youve been reduced to a jelly i
believe i can speed up that process by
twisting my sword-point around in your
ear he added extending the weapon
experimentally

  wait words came in a rush from
the captives ashy lips tascela took her
from me ive never been anything but
a puppet in tascelas hands

  tascela snorted conan and spat
why the filthy-

  no no panted olmec its worse
than you think tascela is old-centuries
old she renews her life and her youth
by the sacrifice of beautiful young wo-


weird tales

men thats one thing that has reduced
the clan to its present state she will
draw the essence of valerias life into her
own body and bloom with fresh vigor
aid beauty

  are the doors locked asked conan
thumbing his sword edge

  aye but i know a way to get into
tecuhltli only tascela and i know and
she thinks me helpless and you slain
free me and i swear i will help you res-
cue valeria without my help you can-
not win into techultli for even if you
tortured me into revealing the secret you
couldnt work it let me go and we will
steal on tascela and kill her before she
can work magic-before she can fix her
eyes on us a knife thrown from behind
will do the work i should have killed
her thus long ago but i feared that with-
out her to aid us the xotalancas would
overcome us she needed my help too
thats the only reason she let me live this
long now neither needs the other and
one must die i swear that when we
have slain the witch you and valeria
shall go free without harm my people
will obey me when tascela is dead
conan stooped and cut the ropes that
held the prince and olmec slid cautious-
ly from under the great ball and rose
shaking his head like a bull and mutter-
ing imprecations as he fingered his lac-
erated scalp standing shoulder to shoul-
der the two men presented a formidable
picture of primitive power olmec was
as tall as conan and heavier but there
was something repellent about the tla-
itlan something abysmal and monstrous
that contrasted unfavorably with the
clean-cut compact hardness of the cim-
merian conan had discarded the rem-
nants of his tattered blood-soaked shirt
and stood with his remarkable muscular
development impressively revealed his
great shoulders were as broad as those of
olmec and more cleanly outlined and

his huge breast arched with a more im-
pressive sweep to a hard waist that
lacked the paunchy thickness of olmecs
midsection he might have been an im-
age of primal strength cut out of bronze
olmec was darker but not from the
burning of the sun if conan was a fig-
ure out of the dawn of time olmec was
a shambling somber shape from the
darkness of times pre-dawn

  lead on demanded conan and
keep ahead of me i dont trust you any
farther than i can throw a bull by the
tail

  olmec turned and stalked on ahead of
him one hand twitching slightly as it
plucked at his matted beard

olmec did not lead conan back to
the bronze door which the prince
naturally supposed tascela had locked
but to a certain chamber on the border
of tecuhltli

  this secret has been guarded for half
a century he said not even our own
clan knew of it and the xotalancas never
learned tecuhltli himself built this se-
cret entrance afterward slaying the slaves
who did the work for he feared that he
might find himself locked out of his own
kingdom some day because of the spite
of tascela whose passion for him soon
changed to hate but she discovered the
secret and barred the hidden door against
him one day as he fled back from an un-
successful raid and the xotalancas took
him and flayed him but once spying
upon her i saw her enter tecuhltli by
this route and so learned the secret

  he pressed upon a gold ornament in
the wall and a panel swung inward dis-
closing an ivory stair leading upward

this stair is built within the wall
said olmec it leads up to a tower upon
the roof and thence other stairs wind
down to the various chambers hasten
after you comrade retorted conan
red nails



satirically swaying his broadsword as he
spoke and olmec shrugged his shoulders
and stepped onto the staircase conan in-
stantly followed him and the door shut
behind them far above a cluster of fire-
jewels made the staircase a well of dusky
dragon-light

  they mounted until conan estimated
that they were above the level of the
fourth floor and then came out into a
cylindrical tower in the domed roof of
which was set the bunch of fire-jewels
that lighted the stair through gold-
barred windows set with unbreakable
crystal panes the first windows he had
seen in xuchotl conan got a glimpse of
high ridges domes and more towers
looming darkly against the stars he was
looking across the roofs of xuchotl

  olmec did not look through the win-
dows he hurried down one of the sev-
eral stairs that wound down from the
tower and when they had descended a
few feet this stair changed into a narrow
corridor that wound tortuously on for
some distance it ceased at a steep flight
of steps leading downward there ol-
mec paused

  up from below muffled but unmis-
takable welled a womans scream edged
with fright fury and shame and conan
recognized valerias voice

  in the swift rage roused by that cry
and the amazement of wondering what
peril could wring such a shriek from
valerias reckless lips conan forgot ol-
mec he pushed past the prince and start-
ed down the stair awakening instinct
brought him about again just as olmec
struck with his great mallet-like fist the
blow fierce and silent was aimed at the
base of conans brain but the cim-
merian wheeled in time to receive the
buffet on the side of his neck instead
the impact would have snapped the ver-
tebras of a lesser man as it was conan
swayed backward but even as he reeled

he dropped his sword useless at such
close quarters and grasped olmecs ex-
tended arm dragging the prince with him
as he fell headlong they went down the
steps together in a revolving whirl of
limbs and heads and bodies and as they
went conans iron fingers found and
locked in olmecs bull-throat

  the barbarians neck and shoulder felt
numb from the sledge-like impact of ol-
mecs huge fist which had carried all the
strength of the massive forearm thicjc
triceps and great shoulder but this did
not affect his ferocity to any appreciable
extent like a bulldog he hung on grim-
ly shaken and battered and beaten against
the steps as they rolled until at last they
struck an ivory panel-door at the bottom
with such an impact that they splintered it
its full length and crashed through its
ruins but olmec was already dead for
those iron fingers had crushed out his life
and broken his neck as they fell

conan rose shaking the splinters
from his great shoulder blinking
blood and dust out of his eyes

  he was in the great throneroom there
were fifteen people in that room besides
himself the first person he saw was
valeria a curious black altar stood be-
fore the throne-dais ranged about it
seven black candles in golden candle-
sticks sent up oozing spirals of thick green
smoke disturbingly scented these spir-
als united in a cloud near the ceiling
forming a smoky arch above the altar
on that altar lay valeria stark naked her
white flesh gleaming in shocking contrast
to the glistening ebon stone she was not
bound she lay at full length her arms
stretched out above her head to their full-
est extent at the head of the altar knelt
a young man holding her wrists firmly
a young woman knelt at the other end of
the altar grasping her ankles between
them she could neither rise nor move


weird tales

  eleven men and women of tecuhltii
knelt dumbly in a semicircle watching
the scene with hot lustful eyes

  on the ivory throne-seat tascela lolled
bronze bowls of incense rolled their
spirals about her the wisps of smoke
curled about her naked limbs like caress-
ing fingers she could not sit still she
squirmed and shifted about with sensuous
abandon as if finding pleasure in the
contact of the smooth ivory with her sleek
flesh

  the crash of the door as it broke be-
neath the impact of the hurtling bodies
caused no change in the scene the kneel-
ing men and women merely glanced in-
curiously at the corpse of their prince and
at the man who rose from the ruins of
the door then swung their eyes greedily
back to the writhing white shape on the
black altar tascela looked insolently at
him and sprawled back on her seat
laughing mockingly

  slut conan saw red his hands
clenched into iron hammers as he started
for her with his first step something
clanged loudly and steel bit savagely into
his leg he stumbled and almost fell
checked in his headlong stride the jaws
of an iron trap had closed on his leg
with teeth that sank deep and held only
the ridged muscles of his calf saved the
bone from being splintered the ac-
cursed thing had sprung out of the
smoldering floor without warning he
saw the slots now in the floor where the
jaws had lain perfectly camouflaged

  fool laughed tascela did you
think i would not guard against your
possible return every door in this cham-
ber is guarded by such traps stand there
and watch now while i fulfill the destiny
of your handsome friend then i will de-
cide your own

  conans hand instinctively sought his
belt only to encounter an empty scab-
bard his sword was on the stair behind

him his poniard was lying back in the
forest where the dragon had tom it from
his jaw the steel teeth in his leg were
like burning coals but the pain was not
as savage as the fury that seethed in his
soul he was trapped like a wolf if he
had had his sword he would have hewn
off his leg and crawled across the floor to
slay tascela valerias eyes rolled toward
him with mute appeal and his own help-
lessness sent red waves of madness surg-
ing through his brain

  dropping on the knee of his free leg
he strove to get his fingers between the
jaws of the trap to tear them apart by
sheer strength blood started from be-
neath his finger nails but the jaws fitted
close about his leg in a circle whose seg-
ments jointed perfectly contracted until
there was no space between his mangled
flesh and the fanged iron the sight of
valerias naked body added flame to the
fire of his rage

  tascela ignored him rising languidly
from her seat she swept the ranks of her
subjects with a searching glance and
asked where are xamec zlanath and
tachic

  they did not return from the cata-
combs princess answered a man like
the rest of us they bore the bodies of the
slain into the crypts but they have not
returned perhaps the ghost of tolkemec
took them

  be silent fool she ordered harshly
the ghost is a myth

  she came down from her dais playing
with a thin gold-hilted dagger her eyes
burned like nothing on the hither side of
hell she paused beside the altar and
spoke in the tense stillness

  your life shall make me young white
woman she said i shall lean upon
your bosom and place my lips over yours
and slowly-ah slowly-sink this blade
through your heart so that your life flee-
ing your stiffening body shall enter mine
red nails



making me bloom again with youth and
tpvrith life everlasting

  slowly like a serpent arching toward
its victim she bent down through the
writhing smoke closer and closer over the
now motionless woman who stared up
into her glowing dark eyes-eyes that
grew larger and deeper blazing like black
moons in the swirling smoke

  the kneeling people gripped their
hands and held their breath tense for the
bloody climax and the only sound was
conans fierce panting as he strove to tear
his leg from the trap

  all eyes were glued on the altar and
the white figure there the crash of a
thunderbolt could hardly have broken
the spell yet it was only a low cry that
shattered the fixity of the scene and
brought all whirling about-a low cry
yet one to make the hair stand up stiffly
on the scalp they looked and they saw

  framed in the door to the left of the
dais stood a nightmare figure it was a
man with a tangle of white hair and a
matted white beard that fell over his
breast rags only partly covered his gaunt
frame revealing half-naked limbs
strangely unnatural in appearance the
skin was not like that of a normal human
there was a suggestion of scaliness about
it as if the owner had dwelt long under
conditions almost antithetical to those
conditions under which human life or-
dinarily thrives and there was nothing
at all human about the eyes that blazed
from the tangle of white hair they were
great gleaming disks that stared un-
winkingly luminous whitish and with-
out a hint of normal emotion or sanity
the mouth gaped but no coherent words
issued-only a high-pitched tittering

olkemec whispered tascela

  -i- livid while the others crouched in
speechless horror no myth then no
ghost set you have dwelt for twelve

years in darkness twelve years among
the bones of the dead what grisly food
did you find what mad travesty of life
did you live in the stark blackness of
that eternal night i see now why xamec
and zlanath and tachic did not return
from the catacombs-and never will re-
turn but why have you waited so long
to strike were you seeking something
in the pits some secret weapon you
knew was hidden there and have you
found it at last

  that hideous tittering was tolkemecs
only reply as he bounded into the room
with a long leap that carried him over
the secret trap before the door-by
chance or by some faint recollection of
the ways of xuchotl he was not mad
as a man is mad he had dwelt apart
from humanity so long that he was no
longer human only an unbroken thread
of memory embodied in hate and the
urge for vengeance had connected him
with the humanity from which he had
been cut off and held him lurking near
the people he hated only that thin
string had kept him from racing and
prancing off for ever into the black cor-
ridors and realms of the subterranean
world he had discovered long ago

  you sought something hidden whis-
pered tascela cringing back and you
have found it you remember the feud
after all these years of blackness you
remember

  for in the lean hand of tolkemec now
waved a curious jade-hued wand on the
end of which glowed a knob of crimson
shaped like a pomegranate she sprang
aside as he thrust it out like a spear and
a beam of crimson fire lanced from the
pomegranate it missed tascela but the
woman holding valerias ankles was in
the way it smote between her shoulders
there was a sharp crackling sound and
the ray of fire flashed from her bosom
and struck the black altar with a snap-


weird tales

ping of blue sparks the woman top-
pled sidewise shriveling and withering
like a mummy even as she fell

  valeria rolled from the altar on the
other side and started for the opposite
wall on all fours for hell had burst
loose in the throneroom of dead olmec

  the man who had held valerias hands
was the next to die he turned to run
but before he had taken half a dozen
steps tolkemec with an agility appalling
in such a frame bounded around to a
position that placed the man between him
and the altar again the red fire-beam
flashed and the tecuhltli rolled lifeless
to the floor as the beam completed its
course with a burst of blue sparks against
the altar

  then began slaughter screaming in-
sanely the people rushed about the cham-
ber caroming from one another stum-
bling and falling and among them
tolkemec capered and pranced dealing
death they could not escape by the
doors for apparently the metal of the
portals served like the metal-veined stone
altar to complete the circuit for whatever
hellish power flashed like thunderbolts
from the witch-wand the ancient waved
in his hand when he caught a man or a
woman between him and a door or the
altar that one died instantly he chose
no special victim he took them as they
came with his rags flapping about his
wildly gyrating limbs and the gusty
echoes of his tittering sweeping the room
above the screams and bodies fell like
falling leaves about the altar and at the
doors one warrior in desperation rushed
at him lifting a dagger only to fall be-
fore he could strike but the rest were
like crazed cattle with no thought for re-
sistance and no chance of escape

  the last tecuhltli except tascela
had fallen when the princess reached
the cimmerian and the girl who had
taken refuge beside him tascela bent

and touched the floor pressing a design
upon it instantly the iron jaws released
the bleeding limb and sank back into the
floor

  slay him if you can she panted and
pressed a heavy knife into his hand i
have no magic to withstand him

  with a grunt he sprang before the
women not heeding his lacerated leg in
the heat of the fighting-lust tolkemec
was coming toward him his weird eyes
ablaze but he hesitated at the gleam of
the knife in conans hand then began a
grim game as tolkemec sought to circle
about conan and get the barbarian be-
tween him and the altar or a metal door
while conan sought to avoid this and
drive home his knife the women
watched tensely holding their breath

  there was no sound except the rustle
and scrape of quick-shifting feet tolke-
mec pranced and capered no more he
realized that grimmer game confronted
him than the people who had died
screaming and fleeing in the elemental
blaze of the barbarians eyes he read an
intent deadly as his own back and forth
they weaved and when one moved the
other moved as if invisible threads bound
them together but all the time conan
was getting closer and closer to his
enemy already the coiled muscles of his
thighs were beginning to flex for a
spring when valeria cried out for a
fleeting instant a bronze door was in line
with conans moving body the red line
leaped searing conans flank as he twist-
ed aside and even as he shifted he hurled
the knife old tolkemec went down
truly slain at last the hilt vibrating on his
breast

tascela sprang-not toward conan
but toward the wand where it shim-
mered like a live thing on the floor but
as she leaped so did valeria with a dag-
ger snatched from a dead man and the

                     w t-
red nails



blade driven widi all the power of the
pirates muscles impaled the princess of
tecuhltii so that the point stood out be-
tween her breasts tascela screamed once
and fell dead and valeria spurned the
body with her heel as it fell

  i had to do that much for my own
self-respect panted valeria facing co-
nan across the limp corpse

  well this cleans up the feud he
grunted its been a hell of a night
where did these people keep their food
im hungry

  you need a bandage on that leg
valeria ripped a length of silk from a
hanging and knotted it about her waist
then tore off some smaller strips which
she bound efficiently about the bar-
barians lacerated limb

  i can walk on it he assured her

lets begone its dawn outside this
infernal city ive had enough of
xuchotl its well the breed exterminated
itself i dont want any of their accursed
jewels they might be haunted

  there is enough clean loot in the
world for you and me she said
straightening to stand tall and splendid
before him

  the old blaze came back in his eyes
and this time she did not resist as he
caught her fiercely in his arms

  its a long way to the coast she said
presently withdrawing her lips from his

  rwhat matter he laughed theres
nothing we cant conquer well have
our feet on a ships deck before the
stygians open their ports for the trading
season and then well show the world
what plundering means

                    the end

oors of death

by arthur b waltermire

a strange and curious story is this about a banker whose only fear
was that he might be buried alive like his
grandfather before him

a heavy stillness hung about the
great halls and richly furnished

	rooms of judson mcmasters res-
idence and even seemed to extend out
over the velvet lawns the shrub-lined
walks and sun-blotched reaches under the
lacy elms and somber maples

  biggs glided about the sick-chamber
like a specter apparently striving to keep
busy while he cast countless furtive un-
easy glances at the heavy figure under
the white sheets an odor of drugs and
fever tainted the air and a small walnut
table near the flushed sleeper was laden
with the familiar prescription bottle tum-
bler and box of powders on the wall
behind the table near the head of the
bed hung a small oil-painting of na-
poleon

  the sleeper stirred restlessly raised
himself painfully and slowly and at-
tempted to seek fleeting comfort in a new
position at the first movement biggs
was a shadow at the bedside deftly man-
ipulating the coverings and gently aiding
the sick man with a tenderness born of
long service and deep affection as the
massive gray head sank into the fluffed
pillow the tired eyes opened lighted by
a faint glint of thankfulness then they
closed again and the once powerful body
relaxed

with a pitiful wistful expression on
his aged face the faithful biggs stood
helplessly peering at the sick man until
hot tears began to course down his fur-


rowed cheeks and he turned hastily

 away

   biggs

the voice still strong and command-
ing cut the semi-gloom like a knife

  biggs who was about to tuck the heavy
 curtains still more securely over the win-
 dows whirled as though he had touched
 a live wire and in a flash was across the
 great room and beside the bed

  did you call sir his voice quav-
 ered

  no-a faint twinkle lighted the
 sick mans eyes-i just spoke

  all now sir cried the overjoyed
 biggs you are better sir

biggs i want some air and sunshine

  but the doctor sir-

 drat the doctor if im going to
 pass out i want to see where im going

  oh but sir expostulated the old
 servant as he parted the curtains and
 partially opened a casement window i
 wish you wouldnt say that sir

 i believe in facing a situation square-
 y biggs my father and grandfather
 died from this family malady and i
 guess im headed over the same route
 please sir entreated biggs

  biggs i want to ask you a question
  yes sir

  are you a christian

   i try to be sir

  do you believe in death

  biggs was thoroughly startled and con-
 fused

why-a-we all have to die some-
the doors of death



time sir he answered haltingly not
knowing what else to say

  but do we actually die insisted the
sufferer

  well i hope-not yet ventured

the old servant the doctor said-

forget the doctor interposed mc-
masters  biggs you have been in our
service since i was a lad havent you
tears welled into the servants eyes
and his voice faltered

  fifty-six years come next novem-
ber he answered

  well let me tell you something that
even in those fifty-six years you never
learned biggs my grandfather was
buried alive

  oh sir impossible cried biggs
in horror

  absolutely asserted the banker
why-are you-how do you know
sir in a hoarse whisper

  my father built a family mausoleum
in the far corner of this estate didnt
he

  yes sir-he hated burial in the earth
sir after reading a poem of edgar allan
poes sir

  what poem was that biggs

  i dont recall the name of it but i
remember the line faltered biggs
what was it

  oh sir cried the old man lets
talk about something cheerful

  not until were through with this
discussion hiram

thb sound of his given name re-
stored biggs somewhat for the
banker resorted to it only on occasions
when he shared his deepest confidences
with his old houseman

  well the line goes soft may the
worms about him creep sir

  a slight shudder seemed to run
through mcmasters body then after a

tomb-like silence good reason for
building the mausoleum

  yes sir i think so sir

  well with an apparent effort
when they exhumed my grandfathers
remains to place them in the new vault

the casket was opened and-

  oh sir cried biggs throwing out
a trembling expostulating hand but the
banker went on relentlessly

  -the body was turned over on its

side with the left knee drawn up part-
way

  thats the way he always slept-in
life biggs voice was a hollow whisper

  and thats the reason my father after
building himself a mausoleum insisted
that his body be cremated said mcmas-
ters he took no chances

  biggs horrified eyes traveled dully to
the massive urn over the great fireplace
and rested there fascinated

  hiram where is heaven

  biggs eyes flitted back to rest in sur-
prize upon the questioner

  why up there sir pointing toward
the ceiling

  do you believe that the earth rotates
on its axis

  thats what i was taught in school
sir

  if that hypothesis is true we are roll-
ing through space at the rate of about
sixteen miles a minute figured the
banker now you say heaven is up
there

  yes sir

  biggs what time is it

  the servant glanced at the great clock
in the corner

  ah its twelve oclock sir and time
for your medicine in a voice full of
relief

  never mind the drugs command-
ed mcmasters until we finish our prob-
lem in higher mathematics now if i
ask you where heaven is at midnight
weird tales

which will be twelve hours from now
where will you point triumphantly

  why up there replied the bewil-
dered servant again indicating the ceil-
ing

  then cried mcmasters you will
be pointing directly opposite from the
place you indicated a moment ago for
by midnight the earth will have turned
approximately upside down do you get
my point

  yes sir replied poor biggs thor-
oughly befuddled

  then where will heaven be at six
oclock this evening fairly shouted the
sick man

  out there replied the servant hope-
lessly pointing toward the window

  and where will heaven be at six
oclock in the morning

  over there and biggs pointed a
trembling finger at the fireplace then

oh sir lets not-the doctor-

  hang the doctor interrupted mc-
masters testily ive been thinking this
thing over and ive got to talk about it
to someone

  but dont you believe in a hereafter
queried biggs a horrible note of fear in
his pitiful voice

  for a moment the banker was silent
the massive clock ticked solemnly on a
coal toppled with a sputter and flare in
the fireplace

  yes hiram in a thoughtful voice
i suppose i do

  im glad to hear you say that cried
biggs in very evident relief

  ah if you could but tell me con-
tinued the banker from whence we
come and whither we go

  if i knew sir id be equal with the
creator answered biggs with reverence

  thats well said hiram but it doesnt
satisfy me ive made my place in the
world by getting to the root of things
ah if i could only get a peek behind the

curtain before i go-back-stage you
know-mayhap i would not be afraid
to die and his voice fell almost to a
whisper

  the great director does not permit
the audience behind the footlights un-
less he calls them answered biggs
whimsically the ghost of a smile light-
ing up his troubled features

  another thing biggs do you believe
those stories about jonah and lazarus
and the fellow they let down through a
hole in the roof to be healed

  i do sir with conviction

  do you understand how it was
done testily

  of course not sir being only a hu-
man

  then tell me hiram when you can-
not see through it how can you swallow
all this theology

  my faith sir answered biggs sim-
ply raising his eyes with reverence

  at this a quizzical smile came over
the sick mans face

  in looking up hiram dont forget
since it is twelve-thirty that we have
swung around four hundred and eighty
miles from the spot you originally desig-
nated as the location of the pearly gates

  oh sir i beg of you remonstrated
the servant i cannot bear to have you
jest on such a-why master he broke
off with a little cry rushing to his bed-
side

  the quizzical smile on the bankers
face had suddenly faded and his head
had fallen feebly back upon the pillow

  oh why did he waste his strength
so cried biggs piteously as with trem-
bling hands and tear-blurred eyes he
searched the little table for the smelling-
salts

  after a few breaths the patient sighed
and opened his eyes wearily

  my medicine hiram and then i must
rest
toe doors of death



at midnight biggs dozing in a big
k chair by the fire was aroused by a
voice from the sick bed

  hiram

  yes sir scurrying to turn on a sub-
dued light

  where is heaven now

  noting the wan flicker of a smile the
old servant pointed solemnly downward

  you are a bright pupil came in a
scarcely audible voice

  thank you sir

  do you know biggs i wish i had
led a different-a better life

  you have been a good master sir
you have been kind you have given lib-
erally to charity biggs defended him

  yes cynically i have given liber-
ally to charity but it has been no sac-
rifice

  tyou have been a pillar in the
church ventured biggs

  yes bitterly a stone pillar i have
paid handsomely for my pew and slept
peacefully through the sermons i have
bought baskets of food for the poor at
thanksgiving and christmas time only
to let others reap the happiness of giving
them away i could have had so much
joy out of christmas if i would i
could have been a jolly rosy-cheeked
santa claus and gone to a hundred
homes my arms loaded with gifts

  true sir but you made that joy pos-
sible for others

  when i should have known the thrill
of it myself i have not reaily lived
hiram to draw the sweets truly out of
life one must humble himself and serve
his fellow men yes the scales have fall-
en from my eyes hiram but it is too
late the spirit is willing but the flesh is
weak

  it doesnt seem right sir said biggs
after a pause

  whats that hiram

  why sir that you should be stricken

down in the prime of life just at a time
when you could mean so much to others
while i old and useless am permitted to
live on but i am not finding fault with
providence sir biggs hastened to say
i just cant find the meaning of the
riddle sir

  probably ive had my chance and
fumbled it biggs

  even so sir god is not vindictive
according to my ideas there surely is
some other solution im still going to
pray that he will take me in your stead
even if a miracle must be performed
so you have faith in your prayers do
you biggs

   yes sir if they are unselfish prayers
that brand is rather scarce i take
it answered mcmasters but his tone
was reflective rather than sarcastic

  oh sir i wish you would pray as i
do god would surely understand
rather a queer request hiram iff
my life depends upon your death no pray-
er shall ever pass my lips

  but sir im an old-

  however interrupted mcmasters i
shall pray that if my life is spared in any
other fashion i will make full amends
for my years of indifference and neglect
and hiram no one knows how much 
truly seek this divine dispensation but
i have always scoffed at death-bed con-
fessions and so my heart grows cold for
i have no right to ask-now again
wearily no right-now

  all master god is plenteous in mer-
cy if you but have the faith sir it shall
make you whole

  very good had i lived as you have
lived biggs then after a pause still
the cause is worthy my heart is right
and i shall approach the throne may
god be merciful unto me a sinner

  i hope it is not too late yet faltered
biggs oh if god would only call me


weird tales

in your stead that you might still do the
good work that you find it in your heart
to do how gladly would i go

  a deep sigh was his only answer

along silence was finally broken by
the sick man but when he spoke
his voice was so strange and uncanny
that the servant hastened close and peered
anxiously into the fever-flushed face of
the sufferer

  hiiam-i must tell you-a secret
came in a laborious almost sepulchral
whisper

  biggs came closer

  bring a chair and sit down i must
talk to you

  as the old servant again leaned for-
ward the sufferer hesitated then with an
obvious effort he began

hiram i am going to give you some
instructions which you must obey to the
letter will you promise to keep them
i swear it sir with great earnest-
ness

  good now if this fever seals my
lips and the doctor pronounces me

dead-

  please sir biggs broke in tears
streaming down liis furrowed cheeks but
his master continued in the same sub-
dued voice whatever happens i am
not to be embalmed-do you hear me-
not embalmed but just laid away as i
am now

  yes sir in a choked voice which
fully betrayed the breaking heart be-
hind it

   and now hiram the rest of the
secret he paused and beckoned biggs
to lean closer

  in my vault-in the mausoleum i
have had an electric button installed
that button connects with a silver bell
lift up that small picture of napoleon
there upon the wall

  his hands trembling as with the palsy

biggs reached out and lifted aside the
picture hanging near the head of the
bed and there revealed the silver bell
fitted into a small aperture in the wall
then with a sob he fell back into his
chair

  hiram-in a whisper-after they
bury me you are to sleep in this bed

  with a cry the old man threw out a
horrified expostulating hand catching
it feverishly the banker half raised him-
self in bed

  dont you understand he cried
fiercely i may not be dead after all
remember grandfather and biggs-if
that bell rings get help-quick

  suddenly releasing his hold mcmas-
ters fell back limply among the pillows

all through the long night the faith-
 ful biggs maintained a sleepless
vigil but the banker lay as immovable as
a stone when the rosy-cheeked dawn
came peeping audaciously through the
casements biggs drew the heavy curtains
tightly shut once more

  not until the doctors motor whirled
away did the patient rouse from his leth-
argy

  apparently strengthened by his deep
stupor he spoke and biggs stood instant-
ly beside him

  what did the doctor say

  biggs hesitated

  out with it im no chicken-hearted
weakling

  nothing much admitted biggs sad-
ly he only shook his head very
gravely

  he doesnt understand this family
malady any more than the old quack who
allowed my grandfather to be buried
alive said mcmasters almost fiercely

  biggs shuddered and put a trembling
hand to his eyes

  what ails me biggs almost plain-
tively no one knows this fever has
the doors of death



baffled the scientists for years when you
fall into a comatose condition they call
it suspended animation thats the best
thing they do-find names for diseases
my family doctor doesnt have any more
of an idea about this malady than you
or i the average physician is just a
guesser he guesses you have a fever
and prescribes a remedy hoping that it
will hit the spot if it doesnt he looks
wise wags his head-and tries something
else on you maybe it works and maybe
it doesnt the only thing my guesser is
absolutely sure of is that if i live or if i
die he will collect a princely fee for his
services

  biggs remained statuesque during the
pause

  gad mcmasters broke out again
testily if i fiddled around in my bus-
iness like that id be a pauper in a
month

  but the doctor says youre coming
on ventured biggs

  sure he does answered the banker
with a sneer thats his stock in trade
 know that line of palaver secretly he
knows i am as liable to be dead as alive
when he comes again

  oh sir you arent going to die

  thats what im afraid of biggs
but theyll call me dead and go ahead
and embalm me and make sure of it

  oh sir i wish-

  now remember biggs broke in the
sick man shoot the first undertaker that
tries to put that mummy stuff in my
veins

  i understand perfectly sir answered
biggs fearful lest the others excitement
might again give him a turn for the
worse

  i know im apparently going to pass
away my father and grandfather both
had this cussed virus in their veins and

i dont believe either of them was dead
when he was pronounced so

  well if by any chance-that is if
you began biggs desperately if you
are apparently-dead-why not have
them keep your body here in the house
for a time

  convention formality custom hide-
bound law the banker fairly frothed
the health authorities would come here
with an army and see that i was buried
no biggs ive got a fine crypt out there
all quiet and secure good ventilation
electric lights like a pullman berth-and
a push-button that precludes all noto-
riety its secret and safe the electrician
who installed the apparatus died four
years ago so you and i alone possess
this knowledge

  dont you think someone else should

know of it too your attorney or-

  no biggs if i really am dead i
dont want anyone to write up my ec-
centricities for some sunday magazine
sheet and if i do come back then it
will be time to tell the gaping public
about my cleverness

  i wish you werent so-so cold-blood-
ed about it all sir

  i have always hit straight from the
shoulder hiram and im facing this
death business as id face any other prop-
osition im not ready to cash in and if
i can cheat the doctors undertakers law-
yers heirs and chief mourners for a few
more years im going to do it anj
dont forget poor old granddad he
might have been up and about yet had he
but used my scheme

biggs turned away sick at heart it
was too terrible beyond words to
him his religion was as essential as daily
bread death was the culmination of
cherished belief and constant prayer as
his years declined he had faced the inev-
itable day with simple faith that when the


weird tales

summons came he would go gladly like
him who wraps the drapery of his
couch about him and lies down to pleas-
ant dreams with throbbing heart he
listened for another torrent of words that
would still further stab his sensitive soul
for he had loved and revered his master
from his youth up

  but no words came he wheeled
about the massive head had fallen limp-
ly among the pillows pallid lips were
trying to form sentences without result
then the great body seemed to subside
immeasurably deeper into the covers and
a death-like stillness fell upon the room

  intuitively feeling that his master was
worse than at any previous relapse biggs
made every effort to revive him gently
at first and then by vigorously shaking
and calling to him in a heart-broken
piteous voice but to no avail the heavy
figure looked pallid and corpse-like un-
der the snowy sheets

  loag hours dragged by and still the
lonely old servant sat mutely beside the
bed only aroused at last by the peremp-
tory measured call of the telephone bell

  yes said biggs in a quavering
voice oh yes doctor meredith mas-
ters resting easy dont think youll
need to come until tomorrow

  tfl keep them away as long as i can
he muttered as he slipped back to his
vigil god grant-maybe hell come
back-and take up the work of the mas-
ter so long delayed oh god if thou
wouldst only take me in his stead

  sleeping fitfully biggs sat dumbly
through an interminable night but the
new day brought no reassuring sign from
the inert form the stillness was appall-
ing the other servants were quartered
in a distant part of the mansion and only
came when summoned again biggs as-
sured the physician that he could gain
nothing by calling and another awful

night found him ashen and distraught
at the bedside sometime in the still
watches he swooned and kindly nature
patched up his shredded nerves before
consciousness once more aroused him
but die strain was more than he could
bear so when the anxious specialist
came unbidden he found a shattered
old watchman who broke down complete-
ly and babbled forth the whole myste-
rious tale concealing nothing but the
secret of the tomb

  in a coffin previously made to order
they laid the unembalmed remains of
judson mcmasters in the family mauso-
leum and the world which had felt his
masterful presence for so many years
paused long enough to lay a costly trib-
ute on his bier and dien went smoothly
on its way

  not so with the faithful biggs en-
sconced in his masters bedroom he
nighdy tossed in troubled sleep filled
with the jangling of innumerable electric
bells and when-on the tenth night
after he had been somewhat reassured
that all was well-he was suddenly
awakened by a mad incessant ringing
from the hidden alarm a deathly weak-
ness overcame him and it was some dme
before he was able to drag his palsied
body from the bed with fumbling
clumsy fingers he tried to hasten but it
was many minutes before he tottered
half dressed out of the room and as
he did so his heart almost stood still
then mounted to his throat as if to choke
him

  biggs-a voice-mcmasters voice
was calling

  he staggered to the head of the wide
massive stairway and looked down there
stood the banker pale emaciated but
smiling

  and then as from an endless distance
came more words

  i forgot to tell you that i had a trap-
the doors of death



door in the end of the casket when you
didnt answer the bell i found i could
come alone

with an inarticulate cry biggs
stretched out his trembling arms

  my master i am coming now
then he swayed stumbled clutched
feebly at the rail and plunged headlong
to the foot of the stairs a crumpled life-
less form

uhe r

ecret of kralitz

by henry kuttner

a story of the shocking revelation that came to the
twenty-first baron kralitz

 awoke from profound sleep to
find two black-swathed forms stand-
ing silently beside me their faces
pale blurs in the gloom as i blinked to
clear my sleep-dimmed eyes one of them
beckoned impatiently and suddenly i
realized the purpose of this midnight
summons for years i had been expecting
it ever since my father the baron kra-
litz had revealed to me the secret and
the curse that hung over our ancient
house and so without a word i rose
and followed my guides as they led me
along the gloomy corridors of the castle
that had been my home since birth

  as i proceeded there rose up in my
mind the stem face of my father and in
my ears rang his solemn words as he
told me of the legendary curse of the
house of kralitz the unknown secret that
was imparted to the eldest son of each
generation-at a certain time

  when i had asked my father as he
lay on his death-bed fighting back the
approach of dissolution

  when you are able to understand
he had told me watching my face in-

tently from beneath his tufted white
brows some are told the secret sooner
than others since the first baron kralitz
the secret has been handed down-

  he clutched at his breast and paused
it was fully five minutes before he had
gathered his strength to speak again in
his rolling powerful voice no gasping
death-bed confessions for the baron kra-
litz

  he said at last you have seen the
ruins of the old monastery near the vil-
lage franz the first baron burnt it and
put the monks to the sword the abbot
interfered too often with the barons
whims a girl sought shelter and the
abbot refused to give her up at the
barons demand his patience was at an
end-you know the tales they still tell
about him

  he slew the abbot burned the mon-
astery and took the girl before he died
the abbot cursed his slayer and cursed
his sons for unborn generations and it
is the nature of this curse that is the
secret of our house

  i may not tell you what the curse is


weird tales

do not seek to discover it before it is re-
vealed to you wait patiently and in due
time you will be taken by the warders of
the secret down the stairway to the under-
ground cavern and then you will learn
the secret of kralitz

  as the last word passed my fathers
lips he died his stern face still set in its
harsh lines

deep in my memories i had not
noticed our path but now the dark
forms of my guides paused beside a gap
in the stone flagging where a stairway
which i had never seen during my wan-
derings about the castle led into subter-
ranean depths down this stairway i was
conducted and presently i came to realize
that there was light of a sort-a dim
phosphorescent radiance that came from
no recognizable source and seemed to be
less actual light than the accustoming of
my eyes to the near-darkness

  i went down for a long time the
stairway turned and twisted in the rock
and the bobbing forms ahead were my
only relief from the monotony of the in-
terminable descent and at last deep
underground the long stairway ended
and i gazed over the shoulders of my
guides at the great door that barred my
path it was roughly chiseled from the
solid stone and upon it were curious
and strangely disquieting carvings sym-
bols which i did not recognize it swung
open and i passed through and paused
staring about me through a gray sea of
mist

  i stood upon a gentle slope that fell
away into the fog-hidden distance from
which came a pandemonium of muffled
bellowing and high-pitched shrill squeak-
ings vaguely akin to obscene laughter
dark half-glimpsed shapes swam into
sight through the haze and disappeared
again and great vague shadows swept
overhead on silent wings almost beside

me was a long rectangular table of stone
and at this table two score of men were
seated watching me from eyes that
gleamed dully out of deep sockets my
two guides silently took their places
among them

  and suddenly the thick fog began to
lift it was swept raggedly away on the
breath of a chill wind the fax dim
reaches of the cavern were revealed as the
mist swiftly dissipated and i stood silent
in the grip of a mighty fear and
strangely an equally potent unaccount-
able thrill of delight a part of my mind
seemed to ask what horror is this
and another part whispered you know
this place

  but i could never have seen it before
if i had realized what lay far beneath
the castle i could never have slept at
night for the fear that would have ob-
sessed me for standing silent with con-
flicting tides of horror and ecstasy racing
through me i saw the weird inhabitants
of the underground world

  demons monsters unnamable things
nightmare colossi strode bellowing
through the murk and amorphous gray
things like giant slugs walked upright on
stumpy legs creatures of shapeless soft
pulp beings with flame-shot eyes scat-
tered over their misshapen bodies like
fabled argus writhed and twisted there
in the evil glow winged things that
were not bats swooped and fluttered in
the tenebrous air whispering sibilantly-
whispering in human voices

  far away at the bottom of the slope i
could see the chill gleam of water a hid-
den sunless sea shapes mercifully al-
most hidden by distance and the semi-
darkness sported and cried troubling the
surface of the lake the size of which i
could only conjecture and a flapping
thing whose leathery wings stretched like
a tent above my head swooped and
hovered for a moment staring with flam
the secret of kralitz



ing eyes and then darted off and was
lost in the gloom

  and all die while as i shuddered with
fear and loathing within me was this
evil glee-this voice which whispered
you know this place you belong here
is it not good to be home

  i glanced behind me the great door
had swung silently shut and escape was
impossible and then pride came to my
aid i was a kralitz and a kralitz
would not acknowledge fear in the face
of the devil himself

i stepped forward and confronted the
warders who were still seated re-
garding me intently from eyes in which a
smoldering fire seemed to bum fighting
down an insane dread that i might find
before me an array of fleshless skeletons
i stepped to the head of the table where
there was a sort of crude throne and
peered closely at the silent figure on my
right

  it was no bare skull at which i gazed
but a bearded deadly-pale face the
curved voluptuous lips were crimson
looking almost rouged and the dull eyes
stared through me bleakly inhuman
agony had etched itself in deep lines on
the white face and gnawing anguish
smoldered in die sunken eyes i cannot
hope to convey the utter strangeness the
atmosphere of unearthliness that sur-
rounded him almost as palpable as the
fetid tomb-stench that welled from his
dark garments he waved a blade-
swathed arm to the vacant seat at the
head of the table and i sat down

  this nightmare sense of unreality i
seemed to be in a dream with a hidden
part of my mind slowly waking from
sleep into evil life to take command of
mjr faculties the table was set with old-
fashioned goblets and trendiers such as
had not been used for hundreds of years
there was meat on the trenchers and red

liquor in the jeweled goblets a heady
overpowering fragrance swam up into my
nostrils mixed with the grave-smell of
my companions and the musty odor of a
dank and sunless place

  every white face was turned to me
faces that seemed oddly familiar al-
though i did not know why each face
was alike in its blood-red sensual lips
and its expression of gnawing agony and
burning black eyes like the abysmal pits
of tartarus stared at me until i felt the
short hairs stir on my neck but-i was
a kralitz i stood up and said boldly in
archaic german that somehow came
familiarly from my lips i am franz
twenty-first baron kralitz what do you
want widi me

  a murmur of approval went around
the long table there was a stir from
the foot of the board a huge bearded man
arose a man with a frightful scar that
made the left side of his face a horror of
healed white tissue again the odd thrill
of familiarity ran through me i had seen
that face before and vaguely i remem-
bered looking at it dirough dim twilight

  the man spoke in the old guttural
german we greet you franz baron
kralitz we greet you and pledge you
franz-and we pledge the house of kra-
litz

  with that he caught up the goblet be-
fore him and held it high all along the
long table die black-swathed ones arose
and eadi held high his jeweled cup and
pledged me they drank deeply savor-
ing the liquor and i made the bow cus-
tom demanded i said in words that
sprang almost unbidden from my mouth

  i greet you who are the warders of
the secret of kralitz and i pledge you in
return

  all about me to the farthermost readi-
es of the dim cavern a hush fell and
the bellows and howlings and the insane


weird tales

tittering of the flying things were no
longer heard my companions leaned ex-
pectantly toward me standing alone at
the head of the bpard i raised my goblet
and drank the liquor was heady ex-
hilarating with a faintly brackish flavor

  and abruptly i knew why the pain-
racked ruined face of my companion had
seemed familiar i had seen it often
among the portraits of my ancestors the
frowning disfigured visage of the found-
er of the house of kralitz that glared
down from the gloom of the great hall
in that fierce white light of revelation i
knew my companions for what they were
i recognized them one by one remem-
bering their canvas counterparts but
there was a change like an impalpable
veil the stamp of ineradicable evil lay on
the tortured faces of my hosts strangely
altering their features so that i could not
always be sure i recognized them one
pale sardonic face reminded me of my
father but i could not be sure so mon-
strously altered was its expression

  i was dining with my ancestors-the
house of kralitz

  my cup was still held high and i
drained it for somehow the grim revela-
tion was not entirely unexpected a
strange glow thrilled through my veins
and i laughed aloud for the evil delight
that was in me the others laughed too
a deep-throated merriment like the bark-
ing of wolves-tortured laughter from
men stretched on the rack mad laughter
in hell and all through the hazy cav-
ern came the clamor of the devils brood
great figures that towered many spans
high rocked with thundering glee and
the flying things tittered slyly overhead
and out over the vast expanse swept the
wave of frightful mirth until the half-
seen things in the blade waters sent out
bellows that tore at my eardrums and the
unseen roof far overhead sent back roar-
ing echoes of the damor

  and i laughed with them laughed in-
sanely until i dropped exhausted into my
seat and watched the scarred man at the
other end of the table as he spoke

  you are worthy to be of our com-
pany and worthy to eat at the same
board we have pledged each other and
you are one of us we shall eat together

  and we fell to tearing like hungry
beasts at the succulent white meat in the
jeweled trenchers strange monsters
served us and at a chill touch on my arm
i turned to find a dreadful crimson
thing like a skinned child refilling my
goblet strange strange and utterly blas-
phemous was our feast we shouted and
laughed and fed there in the hazy light
while all around us thundered the evil
horde there was hell beneath castle
kralitz and it held high carnival this
night

presently we sang a fierce drinking-
song swinging the deep cups bade
and forth in rhythm with our shouted
chant it was an ardiaic song but the
obsolete words were no handicap for i
mouthed them as though they had been
learned at my mothers knee and at the
thought of my mother a trembling and a
weakness ran through me abruptly but i
banished it with a draft of the heady
liquor

  long long we shouted and sang and
caroused there in the great cavern and
after a time we arose together and
trooped to where a narrow high-arched
bridge spanned the tenebrous waters of
the lake but i may not speak of what
was at the other end of the bridge nor
of the unnamable things that i saw-and
did i learned of the fungoid inhuman
beings that dwell on far cold yuggoth
of the cydopean shapes that attend un-
sleeping cthulhu in his submarine dty
of the strange pleasures that the followers
of leprous subterranean yog-sotiioth may
the secret of kralitz



possess and i learned too of the unbe-
lievable manner in which iod the source
is worshipped beyond the outer galaxies
i plumbed the blackest pits of hell and
came back-laughing i was one with the
rest of those dark warders and i joined
them in the saturnalia of horror until the
scarred man spoke to us again

  our time grows short he said his
scarred and bearded white face like a
gargoyles in the half-light we must
depart soon but you are a true kralitz
franz and we shall meet again and feast
again and make merry for longer than
you think one last pledge

  i gave it to him to the house of
kralitz may it never fall

  and with an exultant shout we drained
the pungent dregs of the liquor

   ttien a strange lassitude fell upon me
with the others i turned my back on the
cavern and the shapes that pranced and
bellowed and crawled there and i went
up through the carved stone portal we
filed up the stairs up and up endlessly
until at last we emerged through the gap-
ing hole in the stone flags and proceed-
ed a dark silent company back through
those interminable corridors the sur-
roundings began to grow strangely famil-
iar and suddenly i recognized them

  we were in the great burial vaults
below the castle where the barons kra-
litz were ceremoniously entombed each
baron had been placed in his stone casket
in his separate chamber and each cham-
ber lay like beads on a necklace adjacent
to the next so that we proceeded from
the farthermost tombs of the early barons
kralitz toward the unoccupied vaults by
immemorial custom each tomb lay bare
an empty mausoleum until the time had
come for its use when the great stone
coffin with the memorial inscription
carved upon it would be carried to its
place it was fitting indeed for the
secret of kralitz to be hidden here

  abruptly i realized that i was alone
save for the bearded man with the dis-
figuring scar the others had vanished
and deep in my thoughts i had not
missed them my companion stretched
out his black-swathed arm and halted my
progress and i turned to him question-
ingly he said in his sonorous voice i
must leave you now i must go back to
my own place and he pointed to the
way whence we had come

  i nodded for i had already recognized
my companions for what they were i
knew that each baron kralitz had been
laid in his tomb only to arise as a mon-
strous thing neither dead nor alive to
descend into the cavern below and take
part in the evil saturnalia i realized too
that with the approach of dawn they had
returned to their stone coffins to lie in a
death-like trance until the setting sun
should bring brief liberation my own
occult studies had enabled me to recog-
nize these dreadful manifestations

  i bowed to my companion and would
have proceeded on my way to the upper
parts of the castle but he barred my
path he shook his head slowly his scar
hideous in the phosphorescent gloom

   i said may i not go yet

  he stared at me with tortured smol-
dering eyes that had looked into hell it-
self and he pointed to what lay beside
me and in a flash of nightmare realiza-
tion i knew the secret of the curse of kra-
litz there came to me the knowledge
that made my brain a frightful thing in
which shapes of darkness would ever
swirl and scream the dreadful compre-
hension of when each baron kralitz was
initiated into the brotherhood of blood i
knew-i knew-that no coffin had ever
been placed unoccupied in the tombs and
i read upon the stone sarcophagus at my
feet the inscription that made my doom
known to me-my own name franz

experiment

          by a conan doyle

of all the sciences which have
puzzled the sons of men none
had such an attraction for the
learned professor von baumgarten as
those which relate to psychology and the
ill-defiaed relations between mind and
matter- a celebrated anatomist a pro-
found chemist and one of the first physi-
ologists in europe it was a relief for him
to turn from these subjects and bring his
varied knowledge to bear upon the study
of the soul and the mysterious relation-
ship of spirits at first when as a young
man he began to dip into the secrets of
mesmerism his mind seemed to be
wandering in a strange land where all
was chos and darkness save that here
and there some great unexplainable and
disconnected fact loomed out in front of
him as the years passed however and
as the worthy professors stock of knowl-
edge increased for knowledge begets
knowledge as money bears interest much
which had seemed strange and unaccount-
able began to take another shape in his
eyes new trains of reasoning became
 

familiar to him and he perceived con-
necting links where all had been incom-
prehensible and startling by experi-
ments which extended over twenty years
he obtained a basis of facts upon which
it was his ambition to build up a new
exact science which should embrace mes-
merism spiritualism and all cognate sub-
jects in this he was much helped by his
intimate knowledge of the more intri-
cate parts of animal physiology which
treat of nerve currents and the working
of the brain for alexis von baumgarten
was regius professor of physiology at the
university of keinplatz and had all the
resources of the laboratory to aid him
in his profound researches

  professor von baumgarten was tall
and thin with a hatchet-face and steel-
gray eyes which were singularly bright
and penetrating much thought had fur-
rowed his forehead and contracted his
heavy eyebrows so that he appeared to
wear a perpetual frown which often
misled people as to his character for
though astute he was tender-hearted he

the great keinplatz experiment



was popular among the students who
would gather round him after his lec-
tures and listen eagerly to his strange
theories often he would call for volun-
teers from among them in order to con-
duct some experiment so that eventually
there was hardly a lad in the class who
had not at one time or another been
thrown into a mesmeric trance by his
professor

  of all these young devotees of science
there was none who equaled in enthusi-
asm fritz von hartmann it had often
seemed strange to his fellow students that
wild reckless fritz as dashing a young
fellow as ever hailed from the rhine-
lands should devote the time and trouble
which he did in reading up abstruse
works and in assisting the professor in
his strange experiments the fact was
however that fritz was a knowing and
long-headed fellow months before he
had lost his heart to young elise the
blue-eyed yellow-haired daughter of the
lecturer although he had succeeded in
learning from her lips that she was not
indifferent to his suit he had never
dared to announce himself to her family
as a formal suitor hence he would have
found it a difficult matter to see his young
lady had he not adopted the expedient
of making himself useful to the profes-
sor by this means he frequently was
asked to the old mans house where he
willingly submitted to be experimented
upon in any way as long as there was a
chance of his receiving one bright glance
from the eyes of elise or one touch of
her little hand

  young fritz von hartmann was a
handsome lad enough there were broad
acres too which would descend to him
when his father died to many he
would have seemed an eligible suitor
but madam frowned upon his presence
in the house and lectured the professor
at times on his allowing such a wolf to

prowl around their iamb to tell the
truth fritz had an evil name in kein-
platz never was there a riot or duel
or any other mischief afoot but the
young rhinelander figured as a ring-
leader in it no one used more free
and violent language no one drank
more no one played cards more habitual-
ly no one was more idle save in the one
solitary subject no wonder then that
the good frau professorin gathered her
jrauleirt under her wing and resented
the attentions of such a mativais sujet as
to the worthy lecturer he was too much
engrossed by his strange studies to form
an opinion upon the subject one way or
the other

for many years there was one ques-
tion which had continually obtruded
itself upon his thoughts all his experi-
ments and his theories turned upon a
single point a hundred times a day the
professor asked himself whether it was
possible for the human spirit to exist
apart from the body for a time and then
to return to it once again when the
possibility first suggested itself to him
his scientific mind had revolted from it
it clashed too violently with preconceived
ideas and the prejudices of his early
training gradually however as he pro-
ceeded farther and farther along the
pathway of original research his mind
shook off its old fetters and became ready
to face any conclusion which could
reconcile the facts there were many
things which made him believe that it
was possible for mind to exist apart
from matter at last it occurred to him
that by a daring and original experiment
the question might be definitely decided

  it is evident he remarked in his
celebrated article upon invisible entities
which appeared in the keinplatz
wochenliche medicalschrift about this
time and which surprized the whole


weird tales

scientific world-it is evident that under
certain conditions the soul or mind does
separate itself from the body in the
case of a mesmerized person the body
lies in a cataleptic condition but die
spirit has left it perhaps you reply that
die soul is there but in a dormant con-
dition i answer that this is not so otiier-
wise how can one account for the condi-
tion of clairvoyance which has fallen
into disrepute through the knavery of
certain scoundrels but which can easily
be shown to be an undoubted fact

  i have been able myself with a
sensitive subject to obtain an accurate
description of what was going on in
another room or another house how
can such knowledge be accounted for on
any hypothesis save that the soul of the
subject has left the body and is wander-
ing through space for a moment it is
recalled by the voice of the operator and
says what it has seen and then wings its
way once more through the air since
the spirit is by its very nature invisible
we cannot see these comings and goings
but we see their effect in die body of
the subject now rigid and inert now
struggling to narrate impressions which
could never have come to it by natural
means

  there is only one way which i can
see by which the fact can be demon-
strated although we in the flesh are
unable to see these spirits yet our own
spirits could we separate them from the
body would be conscious of the presence
of others it is my intention therefore
shortly to mesmerize one of my pupils i
shall then mesmerize myself in a manner
which has become easy to me after that
if my theory holds good my spirit will
have no difficulty in meeting and com-
muning with the spirit of my pupil both
being separated from die body i hope
to be able to communicate the result of
diis interesting experiment in an early

number of the keinplatz w ochenliche
medicalschrift

  when the good professor finally ful-
filled his promise and published an ac-
count of what occurred the narrative
was so extraordinary that it was received
with general incredulity the tone of
some of the papers was so offensive in
their comments upon the matter that the
angry savant declared diat he would
never open his mouth again or refer to
the subject in any way-a promise which
he has faithfully kept this narrative
has been compiled however from the
most authentic sources and the events
cited in it may be relied upon as sub-
stantially correct

it happened dien that shortly after
the time when professor von baum-
garten conceived the idea of the above-
mentioned experiment he was walking
thoughtfully homeward after a long day
in the laboratory when he met a crowd
of roystering students who had just
streamed out from a beer-house at the
head of them half intoxicated and very
noisy was young fritz von hartmann
the professor would have passed them
but his pupil ran across and intercepted
him

  heh my worthy master he said
taking the old man by the sleeve and
leading him down the road with him
there is somediing that i have to say
to you and it is easier for me to say it
now when the good beer is humming in
my head than at another time

  what is it then fritz the physi-
ologist asked looking at him in mild
surprize

  i hear mein herr that you are about
to do some wondrous experiment in
which you hope to take a mans soul out
of his body and then to put it back again
is it not so

   it is true fritz

                     w t-
the great keinplatz experiment	

  and have you considered my dear
sir that you may have some difficulty in
finding someone on whom to try this
potztausend suppose that the soul went
out and would not come back that
would be a bad business who is to
take the risk

   but fritz the professor cried very
much startled by this view of the matter
i had relied upon your assistance in the
attempt surely you will not desert me
consider the honor and glory

  consider the fiddlesticks the stu
dent cried angrily am i to be paid
always thus did i not stand two hours
upon a glass insulator while you poured
electricity into my body have you not
stimulated my phrenic nerves besides
ruining my digestion with a galvanic cur-
rent round my stomach four-and-thirty
times you have mesmerized me and
what have i got from all this nothing
and now you wish to take my soul
out as you would take the works from
a watch it is more than flesh and blood
can stand

  dear dear the professor cried in
great distress that is very true fritz
i never thought of it before if you can
but suggest how i can compensate you
you will find me ready and willing

  then listen said fritz solemnly
if you will pledge your word that after
this experiment i may have the hand of
your daughter then i am willing to assist
you but if not i shall have nothing to
do with it these are my only terms

  and what would my daughter say
to this the professor exclaimed after a
pause of astonishment

  elise would welcome it the young
man replied we have loved each other
long

then she shall be yours the physi-
ologist said with decision for you are a
good-hearted young man and one of the
best neurotic subjects that i have ever
w t-

known-that is when you are not under
the influence of alcohol my experiment
is to be performed upon the fourth of
next month you will attend at the
physiological laboratory at twelve oclock
it will be a great occasion fritz von
gruben is coming from jena and hinter-
stein from basle the chief men of
science of all south germany will be
there

  i shall be punctual the student
said briefly and so the two parted

the professor did not exaggerate
when he spoke of the widespread
interest excited by his novel psycho-
physiological experiment long before
the hour had arrived the room was filled
with a galaxy of talent besides the
celebrities whom he had mentioned there
had come from london the great pro-
fessor lurcher who had just established
his reputation by a remarkable treatise
upon cerebral centers several great
lights of the spiritualistic body had also
come a long distance to be present as
had a swedenborgian minister who con-
sidered that the proceedings might throw
some light upon the doctrines of the
rosy cross

  there was considerable applause from
this eminent assembly upon the appear-
ance of professor von baumgarten and
his subject upon the platform the lec-
turer in a few well-chosen words ex-
plained what his views were and how he
proposed to test them

   i hold he said that when a person
is under the influence of mesmerism his
spirit is for the time released from his
body and i challenge anyone to put
forward any other hypothesis which will
account for the fact of clairvoyance i
therefore hope that upon mesmerizing
my young friend here and then putting
myself into a trance our spirits may be
able to commune together though our


weird tales

bodies lie still and inert after a time
nature will resume her sway our spirits
will return into our respective bodies
and all will be as before with your kind
permission we shall now proceed to at-
tempt the experiment

  the applause was renewed at this
speech and the audience settled down in
expectant silence with a few rapid
passes the professor mesmerized the
young man who sank back in his chair
pale and rigid he then took a bright
globe of glass from his pocket and by
concentrating his gaze upon it and mak-
ing a strong mental effort he succeeded
in throwing himself into the same condi-
tion it was a strange and impressive
sight to see the old man and the young
sitting together in the same cataleptic
state whither then had their souls
fled that was the question which pre-
sented itself to each and every one of
the spectators

  five minutes passed and then ten and
then fifteen and then fifteen more while
the professor and his pupil sat stiff and
stark upon the platform during that
time not a sound was heard from the
assembled savants but every eye was bent
upon the two pale faces in search of the
first signs of returning consciousness

  nearly an hour had elapsed before the
patient watchers were rewarded a faint
flush came back to the cheeks of pro-
fessor von baumgarten the soul was
coming bade once more to its earthly
tenement suddenly he stretched out his
jong thin arms as one awaking from
sleep and rubbing his eyes stood up
from his chair and gazed about him as
though he hardly realized where he was

  tausend teufel he exclaimed rap-
ping our a tremendous south german
oath to the great astonishment of his
audience and to the disgust of the swe-
denborgian where the henker am i
then and what in thunder has occurred

oh yes i remember now one of these
nonsensical mesmeric experiments there
is no result this time for i remember
nothing at all since i became unconscious
so you have had all your long journeys
for nothing my learned friends and a
very good joke too at which the regius
professor of physiology burst into a roar
of laughter and slapped his thigh in a
highly indecorous fashion

  the audience were so enraged at this
unseemly behavior on the part of their
host that there might have been a con-
siderable disturbance had it not been for
the judicious interference of young fritz
von hartmann who had now recovered
from his lethargy stepping to the front
of the platform the young man apolo-
gized for the conduct of his companion

  i am sorry to say he said that he
is a harum-scarum sort of fellow al-
though he appeared so grave at the com-
mencement of this experiment he is still
suffering from mesmeric reaction and is
hardly accountable for his words as to
the experiment itself i do not consider
it to be a failure it is very possible that
our spirits may have been communing in
space during this hour but unfortu-
nately our gross bodily memory is distinct
from our spirit and we cannot recall
what has occurred my energies shall
now be devoted to devising some means
by which spirits may be able to recollect
what occurs to them in their free state
and i trust that when i have worked this
out i may have the pleasure of meeting
you all once again in this hall and
demonstrating to you the result

  this address coming from so young a
student caused considerable astonishment
among the audience and some were in-
clined to be offended thinking that he
assumed rather too much importance
the majority however looked upon him
as a young man of great promise and
many comparisons were made as they left
the great keinplatz experiment



the hall between his dignified conduct
and the levity of his professor who dur-
ing the above remarks was laughing
heartily in a corner by no means abashed
at the failure of the experiment

  now although all these learned men
were filing out of the lecture-room under
the impression that they had seen nothing
of note as a matter of fact one of the
most wonderful things in the whole his-
tory of the world had just occurred before
their very eyes professor von baumgar-
ten had been so far correct in his theory
that both his spirit and that of his pupil
had been for a time absent from his body
but here a strange and unforeseen com-
plication had occurred in their return
the spirit of fritz von hartmann had en-
tered into the body of alexis von baum-
garten and that of alexis von baumgar-
ten had taken up its abode in the frame
of fritz von hartmann hence the slang
and scurrility which issued from the lips
of the serious professor and hence also
the weighty words and grave statements
which fell from the careless student it
was an unprecedented event yet no one
knew of it least of all those whom it con-
cerned

the body of the professor feeling
conscious suddenly of a great dryness
about the back of the throat sallied out
into the street still chuckling to himself
over the result of the experiment for the
soul of fritz within was reckless at the
thought of the bride whom he had won
so easily his first impulse was to go up
to the house and see her but on second
thoughts he came to the conclusion that
it would be best to stay until madam
baumgarten should be informed by her
husband of the agreement which had
been made he therefore made his way
down to the griiner mann which was
one of the favorite trysting-places of the
wilder students and ran boisterously

waving his cane in the air into the little
parlor where sat spiegler and muller
and half a dozen other boon companions

  ha ha my boys he shouted i
knew i should find you here drink up
every one of you and call for what you
like im going to stand treat today

  had the green man who is depicted
upon the sign-post of that well-known
inn suddenly marched into the room and
called for a bottle of wine the students
could not have been more amazed than
they were by this unexpected entry of
their revered professor they were so
astonished that for a minute or two they
glared at him in utter bewilderment with-
out being able to make any reply to his
hearty invitation

  donner und elitzen shouted the
professor angrily what the deuce is
the matter with you then you sit there
like a set of stuck pigs staring at me
what is it then

  it is the unexpected honor stam-
mered spiegel who was in the chair

  honor-rubbish said the professor
testily do you think that just because
i happen to have been exhibiting mes-
merism to a parcel of old fossils i am
therefore too proud to associate with dear
old friends like you come out of that
chair spiegel my boy for i shall preside
now beer or wine or schnapps my lads
-call for what you like and put it all
down to me

  never was there such an afternoon in
the griiner mann the foaming flagons
of lager and the green-necked bottle of
rhenish circulated merrily by degrees
the students lost their shyness in the pres-
ence of their professor as for him he
shouted he sang he roared he balanced
a long tobacco-pipe upon his nose and
offered to run a hundred yards against
any member of the company the kellner
and the bar-maid whispered to each other
outside the door their astonishment at


weird tales

such proceedings on the part of a regius
professor of the ancient university of
keinplatz they had still more to whis-
per about afterward for the learned man
cracked the kellnes crown and kissed
the bar-maid behind the kitchen door

  gentlemen said the professor stand-
ing up albeit somewhat totteringly at the
end of the table and balancing his high
old-fashioned wine-glass in his bony
hand i must now explain to you what
is the cause of this festivity

  hear hear roared the students
hammering their beer-glasses against the
table a speech a speech-silence for a
speech

  the fact is my friends said the pro-
fessor beaming through his spectacles
i hope very soon to be married

  married cried a student bolder than
the others is madam dead then

  madam who

  why madam von baumgarten of
course

  ha ha laughed the professor i
can see then that you know all about
my former difficulties no she is not
dead but i have reason to believe that
she will not oppose my marriage

  that is very accommodating of her
remarked one of the company

  in fact said the professor i hope
that she will now be induced to aid me in
getting a wife she and i never took to
each other very much but now i hope
ail that may be ended and when i marry
she will come and stay with me

  what a happy family exclaimed
some wag

  yes indeed and i hope you will
come to my wedding all of you i wont
mention names but here is to my little
bride and the professor waved his glass
in the air

  heres to his little bride roared
the roysterers with shouts of laughter
heres her health se soil leben-

hoch and so the fun waxed still more
fast and furious while eadi young fellow
followed the professors example and
drank a toast to the girl of his heart

while all this festivity had been go-
ing on at the griiner mann a very
different scene had been enacted else-
where young fritz von hartmann with
a solemn face and a reserved manner
had after the experiment consulted and
adjusted some mathematical instruments
after which with a few peremptory words
to the janitors he had walked out into
the street and wended his way slowly in
the direction of the house of the profes
sor as he walked he saw von althaus
the professor of anatomy in front of him
and quickening his pace he overtook him

  i say von althaus he exclaimed
tapping him on the sleeve you were
asking me for some information the
other day concerning the middle coat of
the cerebral arteries now i find-

  donnertvetter shouted von althaus
who was a peppery old fellow what
the deuce do you mean by your imperti-
nence ill have you up before the aca-
demical senate for this sir with which
threat he turned on his heel and hurried
away

  von hartmann was much surprized at
this reception its on account ef this
failure of my experiment he said to
himself and continued moodily on his
way

  fresh surprizes were in store for him
however he was hurrying along when
he was overtaken by two students these
youths instead of raising their caps or
showing any other sign of respect gave a
wild whoop of delight the instant that
they saw him and rushing at him seized
him by each arm and commenced drag-
ging him along with them

  gott in hi mm el roared von hart-
mann what is the meaning of this un-
weird tales



paralleled insult where are you taking
me

  to crack a bottle of wine with us
said the two students come along that
is an invitation which you have never re-
fused

  i never heard of such insolence in my
life cried von hartmann let go my
arms i shall certainly have you rusticated
for this let me go i say and he kicked
furiously at his captors

  oh if you choose to turn ill-tem-
pered you may go where you like the
students said releasing him we can do
very well without you

  i know you ill pay you out said
von hartmann furiously and continued
in the direction which he imagined to be
his own home much incensed at the two
episodes which had occurred to him on
the way

  now madam von baumgarten who
was looking out of the window and won-
dering why her husband was late for din-
ner was considerably astonished to see
the young student come stalking down
the road as already remarked she had
a great antipathy to him and if ever he
ventured into the house it was on suffer-
ance and under the protection of the pro-
fessor still more astonished was she
therefore when she beheld him undo the
wicket-gate and stride up the garden path
with the air of one who is master of the
situation she could hardly believe her
eyes and hastened to the door with all
her maternal instincts up in arms from
the upper windows die fair elise had also
observed this daring move upon the part
of her lover and her heart beat quick
with mingled pride and consternation

  good-day sir madam baumgarten
remarked to the intruder as she stood in
gloomy majesty in the open doorway

weird tales

about and get the dinner ready for i am
well-nigh starved

  martha dinner ejaculated the lady
falling back in astonishment

  yes dinner martha dinner howled
von hartmann who was becoming irri-
table is there anything wonderful in
that request when a man has been out all
day ili wait in the dining-room any-
thing will do schinken and sausage
and prunes-any little thing that hap-
pens to be about there you are standing
staring again woman will you or will
you not stir your legs

  this last address delivered with a per-
fect shriek of rage had the effect of send-
ing good madam baumgarten flying
along the passage and through the kitch-
en where she locked herself up in the
scullery and went into violent hysterics
in the meantime von hartmann strode
into the room and threw himself down
upon the sofa in the worst of tempers

  elise he shouted confound the
girl elise

  thus roughly summoned the young
lady came timidly downstairs and into
the presence of her lover

  dearest she cried throwing her
arms round him i know this is all done
for my sake it is a ruse in order to see
me

  von hartmanns indignation at this
fresh attack upon him was so great that
he became speechless for a minute from
rage ad could only glare and shake his
lists while he struggled in her embrace
when ke at last regained his utterance
he indulged in such a bellow of passion
that the young lady dropped back petri-
fied with fear into an armchair

  never have i passed such a day in my
life von hartmann cried stamping
upon tbe floor my experiment has
failed von althaus has insulted rae
two students have dragged me along the
public road my wife nearly faints when

i ask her for dinner and my daughter

flies at me and hugs me like a grizzly
bear

  you are ill dear die young lady
cried your mind is wandering you
have not even kissed me once

  no and i dont intend to either
von hartmann said with decision you
ought to be ashamed of yourself why
dont you go and fetch my slippers and
help your modier to dish the dinner
and is it for this elise cried bury-
ing her face in her handkerchief-is it
for this that i have loved you passionately
for upward of ten months is it for this
that i have braved my mothers wrath
oh you have broken my heart i am sure
you have and she sobbed hysterically

  i cant stand much more of this
roared von hartmann furiously what
the deuce does the girl mean what did
i do ten months ago which inspired you
with such a particular affection for me
if you are really so very fond you would
do better to run down and find the
schinken and some bread instead of talk-
ing all this nonsense

  oh my darling cried the unhappy
maiden throwing herself into the arms
of what she imagined to be her lover
you do but joke in order to frighten your
little elise

now it chanced that at the moment
of this unexpected embrace voa
hartmann was still leaning back against
the end of the sofa which like much
german furniture was in a somewhat
rickety condition it also chanced that be-
neath this end of the sofa there stood a
tank full of water in which the physiolo-
gist was conducting certain experiments
upon the ova of fish and which he kept
in his drawing-room in order to insure
an equable temperature the additional
weight of the maiden combined with the
impetus with which she hurled herself
weird tales



upon him caused the precarious piece of
furniture to give way and the body of the
unfortunate student was hurled backward
into the tank in which his head and
shoulders were firmly wedged while his
lower extremities flapped helplessly about
in the air this was the last straw ex-
tricating himself with some difficulty from
his unpleasant position von hartmann
gave an inarticulate yell of fury and
dashing out of the room in spite of the
entreaties of elise he seized his hat and
rushed off into the town all dripping and
disheveled with the intention of seeking
in some inn the food and comfort which
he could not find at home

  as the spirit of von baumgarten en-
cased in the body of von hartmann
strode down the winding pathway which
led down to the little town brooding an-
grily over his many wrongs he became
aware that an elderly man was approach-
ing him who appeared to be in an ad-

vanced state of intoxication von hart-
mann waited by the side of the road and
watched this individual who came stum-
bling along reeling from one side of the
road to the other and singing a student
song in a very husky and drunken voice
at first his interest was merely excited by
the fact of seeing a man of so venerable
an appearance in such a disgraceful con-
dition but as he approached nearer he
became convinced that he knew the other
well though he could not recall when or
where he had met him this impression
became so strong with him that when the
stranger came abreast of him he stepped
in front of him and took a good look at
his features

  well sonny said the drunken man
surveying von hartmann and swaying
about in front of him where the hetiker
have i seen you before i know you as
well as i know myself who the deuce
are you

weird tales

  i am professor von baucngarten
said the student may i ask who you
are i am strangely familiar with your
features

  you should never tell lies young
man said the other youre certainly
not the professor for he is an ugly snuffy
old chap and you are a big broad-shoul-
dered young fellow as to myself i am
fritz von hartmann at your service

  that you certainly are not exclaimed
the body of von hartmann you might
very well be his father but hullo sir
are you aware that you are wearing my
studs and my watch-chain

  donnerwetter hiccuped the other
if those are not the trousers for which
my tailor is about to sue me may i never
taste beer again

  now as von hartmann overwhelmed
by the many strange things which had
occurred to him that day passed his hand
over his forehead and cast his eyes down-
ward he chanced to catch the reflection
of his own face in a pool which the rain
had left upon the road to his utter
astonishment he perceived that his face
was that of a youth that his dress was
that of a fashionable young student and
that in every way he was the antithesis of
die grave and scholarly figure in which
his mind was wont to dwell in an in-
stant his active brain ran over the series
of events which had occurred and sprang
to the conclusion he fairly reeled under
the blow

	himmeu he cried i see it all our
souls are in the wrong bodies i am you
and yoa are i my theory is proved-but
at what an expense is the most scholarly
mind in europe to go about with this
frivolous exterior oh the labors of a
lifetime are ruined and he smote his
breast in his despair

  i say remarked the real von hart-
mann from the body of the professor
i quite see the force of your remarks

but dont go knocking my body about
like that you received it in excellent
condition but i perceive you have wet it
and bruised it and spilled snuff over my
ruffled shirt-front

  it matters little the other said
moodily such as we are so must we
stay my theory is triumphantly proved
but the cost is terrible

  if i thought so said the spirit of
the student it would be hard indeed
what could i do with these stiff old
limbs and how could i woo elise and
persuade her that i was not her father
no thank heaven in spite of the beer
which has upset me more than it ever
could upset my real self i can see a way
out of it

  how gasped the professor

  why by repeating the experiment
liberate our souls once more and the
chances are that they will find their wajr
back into their respective bodies

no drowning man could clutch
more eagerly at a straw than did

von baumgartens spirit at this sugges-
tion in feverish haste he dragged his
own frame to the side of the road and
threw it into a mesmeric trance he then
extracted the crystal ball from die pocket
and managed to bring himself into the
same condition

  some students and peasants who
chanced to pass during the next hour
were much astonished to see the worthy
professor of physiology and his favorite
student both sitting upon a very muddy
bank and both completely insensible be-
fore the hour was up quite a crowd had
assembled and they were discussing the
advisability of sending for an ambulance
to convey the pair to a hospital when the
learned savant opened his eyes and gazed
vacantly around him for an instant he
seemed to forget how he had come there
but next moment he astonished his audi-
weird tales



ence by waving his skinny arms above
his bead and crying out in a voice of rap-
ture gott set gedankt i am myself
again i feel i am nor was the amaze-
ment lessened when the student spring-
ing to his feet burst into the same cry
and tke two performed a sort of pas de
joie in the middle of the road

  for some time after that people had
some suspicion of the sanity of both the
actors in this strange episode when the
professof published his experiences in the
medicdlschrift as he had promised he
was met by an intimation even from his
colleagues that he would do well to have
his mind cared for and that another such
publication would certainly consign him
to a madhouse the student also found
it wisest to be silent about the matter

  when the worthy lecturer returned
home that night he did not receive the
cordial welcome which he might have

looked for after his strange adventures
on the contrary he was roundly up-
braided by both his female relatives for
smelling of drink and tobacco and also
for being absent while a young scapegrace
invaded the house and insulted its occu-
pants

  it was long before the domestic atmos-
phere of the lecturers house resumed its
normal quiet and longer still before the
genial face of von hartmann was seen be-
neath its roof perseverance however
conquers every obstacle and the student
eventually succeeded in pacifying die en-
raged ladies and in establishing himself
upon the old footing he has now no
longer any cause to fear the enmity of
madam for he is hauptmann von hart-
mann of the emperors own uhlans and
his loving wife elise has already pre-
sented him with two little uhlans as a
visible sign and token of her affection

the tragic death of robert e how-
ard has called forth a chorus of
praise from discerning critics who
have appreciated the genuine literary value
of his work h p lovecraft one of the
acknowledged masters of weird fiction
whose keenly analytical mind has started
many young writers on literary careers
makes the following comment on howards
work howards death forms weird fic-
tions worst blow since the passing of good
old canevin henry s whitehead in 
scarcely anybody else in the pulp field had
quite the driving zest and spontaneity of
robert e howard he put himself into
everything he wrote-and even when he
made outward concessions to pulp standards
he had a wholly unique inner force and
sincerity which broke through the surface
and placed the stamp of his personality on
the ultimate product how ne could sur-
round primal megalithic cities with an aura
of ason-old fear and necromancy and his
recent black canaan wts best story in the
last three or so issues is likewise magnifi-
cent in a more realistic way-reflecting a
genuine regional background and giving a
clutchingly powerful picture of the horror
that stalks tnrough the mossjiung shadow-
cursed serpent-ridden swamps of the far-
ther south others efforts seem pallid by
contrast weird fiction certainly has occasion
to mourn

  to which e hoffmann price the only
weird tales author who knew howard
personally adds i know of few people
whose sudden death would be such a savage
kick on the chin lovecraft says it is the
saddest blow to writers since the death of
henry s whitehead-and i answer saying
be damned to writing-its a lot worse blow
o anyone who knew bob and his parents
bob howard was as complex and likable a


character as one would meet in many a long
days march there is going to be much
wailing among the fantasy fans and just as
much among those who read only howards
vivid action stories in other books-but the
heaviest of it is coming from those who met
him in his native territory

  howard wrote his own epitaph shortly
before his death when he typed ie follow-
ing couplet the second line of which is
taken from the well-known poem by ernest
dowson

   all fled-all done so lift me on the pyre

   the feast is over and the lamps expire

conans strange lands

  irvin t gould of philadelphia writes
it may be rather late to mention it but
your may issue of weird tales is the best
collection of stories i have ever seen between
your front and back covers child of the
winds and the room of shadows top a
splendid collection of weird tales    glad
to hear that robert e howard is coining to
the fore with another conan story i was
afraid the rascally old barbarian was going
to sink down in slothful ease upon the
aquilonian throne and not furnish r e h
with any more weird adventure material but
i guess you cant keep that wild cimmerian
blood quiet so more power to him i cant
take enough space to give bouquets to all
that rate it so i have just mentioned those
that have particularly impressed me bring
on that conan story im all agog couldnt
you prevail upon mr howard to furnish us
a map of ail those strange lands that have
felt the swish of that gmmerian sword  or
would that be in keeping with a weird tale
i leave it to you mr howard piepred a
map showing the strange lands visited by
conan when he wrote that superb weird

 novel the hour of the dragon-the
 editor

the falling method

   corwin stickney jr of belleville new
 jersey writes the july issue is excellent
 i ranjt it second only to the april issue when
 rating the seven published so far this year
 lost paradise and necromancy in naat are
 in a virtual tie for this months honors
 moore is practically unbeatable while clark
 ashton smiths work is always of the finest
 quality since each of these two stories is so
 different from the other both in theme and
 in the style in which it was written i do
 not undertake to evaluate one above the
 other let it suffice to say that i enjoyed
 both hugely and would appreciate nothing
 more than a story by each of them in each
 issue ronal kayser constructed a vivid stir-
 ring story in the unborn seldom have i
 read one more fascinating edmond hamil-
 ton disappointed me with when the world
 slept it was entirely too obvious i hadnt
 read two pages before i had guessed the
 storys outcome i cannot at all understand
 how this yarn can possibly be called weird
 it might pass-on a dark night-as science-
 fiction but weird fiction-never the other
 tales axe good especially loot of the vam-
 pire and the return of sarah purcell i
 havent yet read the new serial or the re-
 print    peculiar thing three of the vic-
 tims in this months stories-in the return
 of sarah purcell the unborn and kharu
 knows all to be exact-got theirs by way
 of the falling method-either by jumping
 out a window or by failing down a flight of
 stairs as in the case of emma in the re-
 turn of sarah purcell i wonder how many
 disceraing readers will notice that tim
 carewe in kharu knows all chose kharu
 as his new name because it and his real
 name carewe are phonetically alike

french phrases

   gertrude hemken of chicago contributes
 the following comments now im gonna
 unload something from my mind thats been
 rankling me for yars n yars so often in
 stories one runs across french phrases and it
 is take for granted the reader knows what
 they mean so no explanation is offered all
 well and good however when one uses a
 sprinkling of other foreign phrases unless
 the author offers translations immediately

weird tales

after a great hue and cry arises a clamorous
howl of derision is sent up by the readers
telling the writer to remember this is amer-
ica and to speak united states ive had ex-
perience in the above matter after introduc-
ing german into a manuscript during high
school days so now for the benefit of
the readers who are ignorant of franais
either by choice or otherwise or am  the
only one who does not know the language
is it too much to ask the writers to pen a
few words extra of translation for in-
stance-wie gehts-how goes it taint
so much work now-is it and if i see
much more of that french rubbish im gon-
na hie me down to your editorial offices and
rub those writers noses in a few german
verbs and tenses and now for a placid
comment on the bizarre and unusual i am
getting to like clark ashton smith better n
better-his stories are acquiring a strange-
ness new to his former tales e g-necro-
mancy in naat a new land a new fate to
befall victims of the wizards braving a simi-
larity to zombie-but so utterly different-
more repellent and the ending pleased me
-the hero didnt vanquish the villain nor
did he escape his doom and save his fair
lady yessir mr smith you are pleasing
me mightily of late the verse hagar by
edgar daniel kramer wasnt half bad he
completes in a few breathless lines a story
that is deeply imbedded within us all-fear
of dark forests-fear of lurking nameless
unknown horrors fear of natural phenomena
that assume the grotesqueness of fearsome
legendary spawns of other worlds ah me-
i am so happy conan is grand recalling
former tales of men and dragons-siegfried
of the nibelungenlied now i spose some-
one wants to know what that means-st
george and his dragon-countless others-
every nation has such a hero i dunno as yet
where the red nails come in but my its
exciting already strange possibly unex-
plored places goody-im just so-o-o hap-
py i could gurgle robert e howard gave
the readers of wt one of the finest most
lovable brutes of a hero anyone could want
conan is the embodiment of the kind of
man everyone admires strength and nerve
to please the men physique-tvunderbarl to
please the ladies enougn rawness to be yet
a barbarian and still experience enough to
be better educated than the majority of those
he encounters he has a mind strong enough

to throw off the spells of wizards he is a
fighter adventurer explorer and lover-a
real he-man mr howard is indeed a clever
man    loot of the vampire certainly
put a new angle on vampires i was well-
satisfied with the whole story  i note
you stated my letter in the july issue was
entertaining i am complimented and trust
that all my letters may be even more so auf
tvied erscbreibenj

the unborn

  john v baltadonis of philadelphia
writes well-i wasnt disappointed in
the least bit loot oj the vampire certainly
had a swell ending that was a peach of a
yarn however it didnt quite take the cake
so to speak ronal kaysers story the un-
born nosing it out the unborn certainly
had a new idea for that reason and because
it was well written i give it first place in
the july issue this story is certainly a great
step from the albino deaths clark ash-
ton smiths yarn necromancy in naat took
third place with hamiltons and moores
tales following virgil finlays art work is
without a doubt superb i often find myself
wondering how he would be on the cover
de lays illustration for hamiltons yarn
when the world slept is certainly a hum-
dinger ill close with an appeal for that
plucky inimitable frenchman jules de
grandin

keep it weird

  arel rusl of mount vernon illinois
writes here goes the first letter that i have
written to this department in ten years of
reading your most excellent magazine i
think its about time one of your old fans
got into the swing of things by telling what
he thinks of old wt in general and the july
issue in particular vampires are my par-
ticular dish and i like short shorts so two
of your fairly recent yarns stick in my mind
namely the horror undying and the amu-
let of hell both were swell and i think ve
should see more from those authors the
best tale in the july issue seemed to me to be
the kelpie for sheer horror and originality
it has few peers the unborn and when
the world slept tie for second place but all
the stories were up to standard which is
tantamount to the highest praise    well
i suppose this is enough for the first fetter
and are you surprized to cote the lick of
weird

brick-bats you see weird tales suits me
just fine no complaints just keep up the
good work and to repeat a paean as old as
my acquaintance with wt keep weird
tales weird

again and again

  charles donnelly of johnson city ten-
nessee wrices ive always enjoyed weird
tales a lot and i think i have proved it by
my consistent reading of it tne tale that
ive enjoyed best lately was child of the
winds by that superb writer edmond ham-
ilton it fascinated me so that i read it
again and again mr hamiltons style of
writing is one that keeps me fascinated until
the end of the story and that is some
praise because there are so few writers that
can do that i think that this story calls for
a sequel because i dont believe lora will be
happy until she is back on the plateau with
her friends  i sincerely tnank weird
tales for so many enjoyable hours it takes
one out of this humdrum world into a place
of dreams the only fault i ever found with
it was when it just printed every other
month i hope that wont happen again be-
cause a month is too long to wait for weird
tales and two months is eons

then and now

  joseph allan ryan of cambridge mary-
land writes do wt readers ever stop to
observe how far weird tales has traveled
since its inception lets take an early issue
of wt-the october  one for in-
stance-and compare it with the latest one
first of all we have j u giesys humorous
pseudo-scientific tale the wicked flea-a
highly illogical story of a flea that grew to
a gigantic size and went chasing big dogs
all over the country it relied on silly names
and one solitary pun to give it humor
then there was seabury quinns the horror
on the links the first de grandin story al-
though tliis tale showed quinns superiority
jn the field of weird story writing it was not
so interesting as are his present de grandin
tales for it gave a scientific explanation to
each phenomenon whereas tooay we find
only indications of the occult in quinns
masterpieces the prophets grandchildren

weird tales

sic but ended up with a surprize ending
which explained everything as a mistake
which could never be incurred tom free-
mans tbe death shower was only a cleverly
constructed detective story not weird while
a mind m shadow by tessida swinges was
a simple childs story related in baby-talk
which could not have been even remotely
connected with weird tales-it should
hare been rejected instead by child life
magazine the weird story reprint wil-
helm hauits the severed hand had a
touch of weirdness to it but was ruined by
a weak ending moreover the title bore lit-
tle relation to the story there were other
stories by authors who were no doubt
prominent and popular at the time but
most of whom have dropped into the back-
ground the illustrations both inside and
on the cover were all done very crudely by
a sole illustrator andrew brosnatch com-
pare his efforts with the present exquisite
work of virgil finlay and mrs brundage
with die detailed dear-cur drawings of har-
old de lay the shadowy mysterious grease-
pencilings of hugh rankin notice too the
wide variety of artists-the early wts had
but one the july  issue was almost a
direct contrast to the early issue of 
which i reviewed clark ashton smiths
scintiilant gem-robert e howards tale
of the barbarian conan-edmond hamil-
tons fascinating weird-scientific tale of the
near future - thorp mccluskys different
vampire thriller-august w derleths
narrative of spirit return proof of his
never-failing mastery - the handsome
manly wade wellmans short tale of
stark horror nearly approaching the point
reached by kuttners the graveyard rats
-the beautiful inside illustrations and the
excellent cover-the usual array of inter-
esting letters in the eyrie-all these round-
ed up an issue which was as nearly perfect
as an issue can be and which was yet
typical af the standard maintained in the
last five years and still some readers
yearn for the good old days

another de grandin tale

  robert a madle of philadelphia
writes necromancy in naat was a good
story beautifully illustrated by virgil fin-
lay his fantastic drawings are in fitting
wich tbe magazine-they are weird with-
out a shadow of a doubt virgil finlay is

your best interior artist de lay your re-
cent addition is also good robert e
howards latest conan adventure takes
first place i have yet to be displeased by
howard and i hope he never stops writ-
ing for weird tales second place goes to
that unusual yarn the unborn this story
presents a decidedly weird plot excellently
written it is a great improvement over
ronal kaysers previous contributions the
ocher tales were very good especially lost
paradise by c l moore moore never fails
to please me with those beautiful tales of
northwest smith do you realize that there
hasnt been a jules de grandin story in the
last six issues and next months forecast
doesnt boast of one either you had better
rectify die situation and secure one soon
cheer up mr madle for two new tales
of jules de grandin will appear soon w-ith
cover designs by margaret brundage-the
editor

varied comments

  paul n nicholaioff of chicago writes
i find real treat when i read seabury quinn
and carl jacobi the formers a rival from
the grave and the latters face in the wind
were excellent mccluskys loot of the
vampire is very entertaining the house of
the evil eye i did not like so well its con-
clusion was mechanically constructed it
went off at a fair start but something else
finished the race ballad of the wolf was an
excellent poem by henry kuttner i hope
to see more of his poems in future issues

unique among magazines

  herberte jordan of wellingborough
england writes i have been a deeply ap-
preciative reader of weird tales for many
years and would like to express my sincere
admiration for the high literary auality of
the stories published year in ana out this
quality is maintained and the success of
weird tales is undoubtedly due to this
fact the brilliant writers regularly contrib-
uting to the magazine are past masters in the
art of inducing those delicious shudders
which run up the spine and set the scalp
tingling with suspense and horror i would
also mention the work of the artists illus-
trating welrd tales the brundage covers
are beautifully done and the recent work by
virgil finlay is superb the eyrie is a good
feature and should as louis c smith seated
weird tales



in a recent issue be usee solely for construc-
tive criticism not silly haggling whatever
adverse criticism is made against weird
tales it is indisputable that it has reached
and is maintaining a very high standard of
weird literature weird tales stands alone
it is indeed unique in every respect from
the first page to the last one is transported
into a world of eery fantasy where whisper-
ing voices hint unutterable horrors

more stories by lovecraft

  b m reynolds of north adams massa-
chusetts writes congratulations on the
july weird tales the best job youve
turned out in many a moon that issue
came dose to perfection all of the stories
were fine in fact with one exception loot
of the vampire was by far the most poorly
written atrodous and terrible piece of work
that i have ever had the displeasure of read-
ing in your fine magazine the plot was
weak the characters unconvindng and the
sequence of events very spotty in places a
child of twelve could scarce find entertain-
ment in that one the other tales however
were all of such a fine quality that it is hard
to pick the best ones lost paradise necro-
mancy in naat and red nails are tales that
transport the reader out of the everyday
and carry him over countless dream-worlds
and realms of enchantment tales of this
type are all too scarce these days the un-
born was a strong and appealing little story
undoubtedly kaysers best to date when
the world slept by hamilton was thought-
provoking and perhaps not too impossible in
these days of saentinc progress and speak-
ing of hamilton his child of the winds in
may was one of the finest tales you have
ever given us the short-shorts were the best
in months the kelpie by wellman and the
snakeskin cigar-case being the best of these
the latter was deddedly an off the trail
story which might have taken first place had
it been longer at any rate it was a damn
good yarn and if bodo wildberg has any
more as good send them along conan
doyles reprint the ring of thoth was the
best tale of andent egyptian mummies that
i have ever had the pleasure of reading by
the way mr editor when if ever are we
going to have any more tales by lovecraft
apparently robert bloch has been trying to
pinch-hit for lovecraft for you but he is an
easy out im sure no one can fill lovecrafts

  donald a wollheim of new york city
writes am always pleased to see robert
blochs stories that young man has cer-
tainly qualified himself for a permanent
place on your list of outstanding authors
he carries on the lovecraft tradition and
by the way where is the grand master hpl
himself these days

  james p harrill of charlotte north
carolina writes i still enjoy reading your
magazine as much as always and still want
you to continue the nudes cm the front of the
magazine although i am now a settled mar-
ried man also i do not think that it hurts
the prestige of your magazine to have an oc-
casional detective or science-fiction story in
fact i do not like the absolutely weird tales
that have awesome sliminess oozing from
the putrid bodies of something-or-other
lets not make the stories too nasty although
i have as good a stomach as any mans i do
not like to read stories like that

  r m tomlinson of ventura california
writes in the june issue i was much
pleased with the drawing signed by h s
delay dont know when i have seen such
real skill in this sort of magazine

  robert bloch of milwaukee writes
robert e howards death is quite a shock
-and a severe blow to wt despite my
standing opinion on conan the fact always
remains that howard was one of wts fin-
est contributors and his king kull series
were among the most outstanding works you
ever printed

  seabury quinn writes from brooklyn
the field of fantastic fiction has lost one
of its outstanding and recognized masters
in robert e howard his solomon kane
stories his tales of kull and latterly his
conan sagas all of them were superb in
their own way he was a quantity producer
but always managed to keep his stuff fresh
and vigorous ttiere are few who can do
this

  jack snow of dayton ohio writes i
have just finished reading the july weird
tales and have laid it aside with mingled
feelings the story i liked best was manly
wade wellmans the kelpie it was an out
and out weird tale not an adventure or thrill
story masking behind a weird jargon

from the black woods beside the trail rose a shriek of blood-curdling laughter
slavering mouthing sounds followed it so strange and garbled that at first 
did not recognize them as human words their unhuman intonations sent a
chill down my spine

   dead men the inhuman voice chanted dead men with torn throats there
will be dead men among the pines before dawn dead men fools you are all
dead 

    ashley and i both fired in the direction of the voice and in the crashing rever-
berations of our shots the ghastly chant was drowned but the weird laugh rang out
again deeper in the woods and then silence closed down like a black fog in which

i	heard the semi-hysterical gasping of the girl she had released ashley and was
clinging frantically to me i could feel the quivering of her lithe body against mine
probably she had merely followed her feminine instinct to seek refuge with the
strongest the light of the match had shown her that i was a bigger man than ashley

    hurry for gods sake ashleys voice sounded strangled it cant be far to
the cabin hurry youll come with us mr garfield

   what was it the girl was panting oh what was it

   a madman i think i answered tucking her trembling little hand under my
left arm but at the back of my head was whispering the grisly realization that no
madman ever had a voice like that it sounded-god-it sounded like some bestial
creature speaking with human words but not with a human tongue   

    you will not want to miss this grim novelette of stark horror-of the terrible
disfigurement inflicted upon adam grimm by the dark priests of inner mongolia and
the frightful vengeance that pursued his enemy to the united states and tracked him
down in the louisiana woods it will be published complete in the november issue
