    strange and weird to me how had i changed so miraculously in three months from
     shy diffident yes man to a dynamic vigorous he-man how had i ever dared
    give my opinion three months before nobody ever knew i held opinions t

a ll my life i had been cursed with a shy timid
self-conscious nature with only a grammar school
education i could never express ideas in a coherent
self-confident way but one day my eye fell upon a
newspaper article which told about a wonderful free
book entitled how to work wonders with words-
a book that was causing widespread comment from
coast to coast-a book that was being read not only
by millionaires but by thousands of others it dis-
cussed men like me and explained how we could over-
come our handicaps

  at first i was skeptical i thought these defects
were a part of my natural makeup-that i would
never be able to overcome them but some subtle
instinct kept prodding me to send for that free book
i lost no time in sending for it as i was positively
amazed at being able to get cost free a book that
made absolutely plain the secrets that most successful
men have used to win popularity distinction money
and success

  as the weeks wore on and i absorbed the principles
of this remarkable method i became conscious of new
physical and mental energy a new feeling of aggres-
siveness and a resurrected personal power that i
ner dreamed i possessed then came that day in
thflsteral meeting when the president called on the
assembled department heads and assistants for sug-
gestions on the proposed new policy

 three months previously the forces of indecision
timiditi- and inability to talk in public would have
held me to my seat but suddenly that new power

took possession of me
and drove me to my
feet that wonderful
-minute daily train-
ing at home had taught
me to forget myself
and think only of my
subject almost auto-
matically the ideas
which had heretofore
lain dormant in a men-
tal jumble now issued
with a vigor clearness
and enthusiasm that
astounded me no less
than my boss and asso-
ciates and i noticed
with silent exultation
the rapt intent look
on my audience as my

because i have written some
for publication professor
horace lome has asked me to
set down in narrative form the story
of our journey into the atlantean
country and how we stumbled on
klifha the crystal city and the
strange thing which befell us there
i have here at my side his volumin-
ous notes covering the scientific as-
pects of our adventure and on these
as a framework i shall weave the tale

  in the plateau country which lies
to the west and south of ouargla on
the sahara route to in-salah and
timbuktu there is a point high in the
hills called djerija by the arabs
where standing under the sun of
noonday one could see far to the
south riding high on the billowing
sands a great and shining city once

there was a splendid glistening castle
there its lofty keep and topless tur-
rets lost in the blue and a wonder-
ful shining pile half mosque half
cathedral of an architecture familiar
to no man who ever trod the route
from in-salah to ouargla in cer-
tain seasons when the sun was right
one might see broad gardens with
splashing fountains and palm-
banked avenues with small jewel-like
houses but these came and went vis-
ible only to the telescopic eyes of the
arabs gaged to the endless sahara
distances

  by night too there was an odd
bluish glow over the spot where the
mirage had been by day and often
the in-salah caravans reported huge
flaming meteors plunging earthward
into the sapphire glow and once a

                                   


weird tales

lone camel-driver came flogging his
beast into ouargla shouting that the
day of judgment was at hand and al-
lah had come for his faithful he
had seen over the mirage city a flash
of lightning and heard the roar of
thunder now there are some cities
in the sahara where it rains occa-
sionally say on an average of once
in twelve years but south of ouargla
it has not rained in the memory of
living man nor is there any account
of rain handed down in the folk-lore
of the people and yet each august
when the summer sirocco blew up out
of that trackless eastern waste of
sand wherein moves no living thing
there were those of keen nostrils
in ouargla who said they had caught
in that searing breath sweetly sickish
odors as of crushed lilies and rotting
fruits

  all this had come to the ears of
professor lorne he was at that time
pottering about shott el jerid the
salt swamps south of tunis working
on the borchardt theory that the lost
atlantis had once been located there
with him was his daughter con-
stance and her betrothed colin pen-
field i came into the story when i
ran across them in a tunis hotel and
being hot for adventure begged the
professor to take me with him on the
expedition he was then planning as
i was something of a topographer
having served in that capacity with
both the american and french ar-
mies during the war he was glad to
take me on

  i had heard of the ouargla mirage
is there anyone who ever set foot on
the shores of north africa who
hasnt but i confess that when he
had revealed his project to me in full
i was a little cold it was too fan-
tastic it seems he was a believer in
the theory that a mirage is the reflec-
tion of some far-distant object
therefore he reasoned if there were
such a mirage to be seen from
djerija then there must be some-

where down in the desert a great
mysterious city of which we knew
nothing with an instrument which
he had recently invented he claimed
he could by sighting on the mirage
obtain the latitude and longitude of
the lost city

  i came to realize then that he be-
lieved the mirage city not only exist-
ed but that it was the lost atlantis
of which he had already found traces
in shott el jerid below tunis

  platos description has misled
modem scientists concerning the lo-
cation of atlantis said he we
locate it beyond gibraltar which we
believe to be the pillar of hercules
but as a matter of fact these are two
distinct points separated by hun-
dreds of miles the real pillar of
hercules as known by the ancients
was located far east and south of
syrtis major in the vicinity of ahag-
gar massif to which ptolemy refers
in mons talae atlantis sank to an
unknown depth in  b c during
a terrific terrestrial upheaval whieh
according to diodorous the greek
historian swept the tectonic area ly-
ing between teneriffe and sicily
but the inhabitants warned of the
impending catastrophe fled inland
and disappeared in the desert i
have no doubt now that this great
city which we see mirrored in the
skies was built by them its re-
markable state of preservation as
evidenced by the mirage is probably
due to the extreme dryness of the
desert atmosphere

  but the palm trees and the odors
they tell about put in constance
lome how could they come out of
a desert waste

  the odors are imagination he
replied and none but the arabs
have seen the palms they are prob-
ably mistaken and anyway whats
to prevent our believing that there
may not be some great oasis there
the upshot of it was that we all
went down to djerija there in the
the city of glass



barren hills the professor set up his
instrument and got his angles of re-
fraction and then we went back to
tunis where it took the whole winter
to figure out the problem we then
returned to ouargla which was to
be the jumping-off place of the ex-
pedition we were delayed for a time
there because the rumor got around
i know not how that we were going
down into the desert seeking the
ghostly city which was mirrored in
the hills around djerija the arabs
believed no good could come of such
a quest and so it was only with ab-
surdly large offers of reward that we
finally prevailed upon some of them
to go even then they demanded
their pay in advance the reason for
which we were soon to learn for on
the sixteenth night out they stole
away and left us without a word of
warning and without so much as a
knife with which to defend ourselves
it was their plan that we should per-
ish in the desert leaving none to
gainsay their report that we had been
attacked and killed by a roving band
of brigands

  i think said the professor ex-
amining his pocket map after we had
held our first council together on dis-
covering our plight   that we may be
nearer our goal than we know that
is perhaps the reason why those
blackguards left us so surreptitious-
ly now those table-lands off to the
south-my map shows nothing of that
sort which plainly indicates that
those who made it did not know what
they were talking about i think if
we pushed forward and climbed into
those hills we might see something
on the other side which would be of
interest to us

  have you not noticed father
put in constance that there is a
distinct odor here-a sweet sickish
smell when the wind sweeps up out of
the south

  ive noticed it said i ive
smelled it for two days now and it

seems to be getting stronger didnt
say anything about it because i
thought it might be imagination  

  professor lome sniffed by
jove i believe youre right it does
seem as though there is a distinct
odor on the wind not unlike moldy
new-mown hay or perhaps rotting
fruits

  thats what they said back in
ouargla-crushed lilies or rotting
fruits   put in penfield

we started out together toward
the hills penfield and i in the
lead leaving the professor and con-
stance plodding on behind ordin-
arily penfield and i more or less
avoided each other i may as well
admit here that i had never liked him
very well even from the first we
were in fact just about opposites in
everything both physically and
mentally-and i daresay spiritually
also though i have no idea as to
what stand he took on those matters
he was short and thickset and dark
whereas i am tall and broad and
light he was gloomy sometimes surly
and always serious whereas i am in-
clined to be somewhat of a happy
devil-may-care and improvident na-
ture in age he was thirty-five i
was five years younger looking
back i think he must have been neu-
rotic which would perhaps explain
why his reason crumpled so quickly
under the assaults which the subse-
quent events were to make upon it
but i know there must have been
good stuff in him otherwise he would
not have been loved by such a wo-
man as constance lome in fact
that was the one point upon which i
envied him though i now deny em-
phatically in view of what followed
between him and me that i had ever
wished him anything but well so far
as she was concerned

  two hours of steady plodding un-
der that broiling sun brought us to
the first of the hills and a half-hour


weird tales

of scrambling saw us on the flat sum-
mit

  there is a distinct difference in
the formation of the terrain from
here south said the professor when
we had regained our breath and
wiped our eyes clear of the flood of
perspiration but so far as i can
see these hills go on and on into the
south without hint of human habita-
tion or sign of water

  we have enough in our canteens
to last about two days said i
and after that-

  penfield suddenly motioned us to
be silent dont move he cau-
tioned theres something some-
body crouching down there behind
one of those rocks it looks like a
man-and yet-but keep on talk-
ing

  we continued our conversation
then until penfield suddenly reached
down to his feet and picked up a
stone signing us to do likewise
turning with my missile ready to
hand i saw a strange figure climbing
up the hillside his arm with hand
open held up in what was apparent-
ly intended as a sign of reassurance

  it was so far as i could see now
a human being apparently a man
well advanced in years to judge from
the smallness of his bowed figure
but it was his clothing which at once
awakened my amazement the morn-
ing sun was by this time half-way to-
ward the zenith the heat was al-
ready almost beyond endurance and
yet this newcomer was swathed from
head to foot in a heavy garment ap-
parently a kind of fur unfamiliar to
me

  bonjour messieurs he called
out as he drew nearer vous navez
ricn a craindre je viens comme
ami

  he thinks were french said i
to penfield who i knew did not un-
derstand that tongue

  ah but i am mistaken called
the little man now in english but

an english of a peculiar metallic in-
tonation which i had never heard
before you are not french but
english-or possibly americans
americans i volunteered
and who may you be pray
call me azor he replied now
drawing near and surveying all of
us particularly constance with eyes
which were full of a curiosity scarce-
ly less than our own azor of the
land to the south

  then we all cried out together
there is a habitable land not far
from here

  only the journey of a day he
returned you wish to go there
we wish to be safely out of
here put in penfield our
wretched arabs ran away from us
during the night

  he nodded his head sagely ah
yes the arabs they have a great
fear of this country-and rightly
so

  meanwhile i had been examining
his face it seemed to me there was
something vaguely unhealthy about
it which belied the vigor of his move-
ments to begin with it was blood-
less a sickly white with none of the
yellow or brown tint which is inevit-
able to the men of the desert what-
ever their age or race at a distance
the flesh appeared to be smooth yet
it gave the impression of being flab-
bily unsound and on his drawing
nearer i saw that it was furrowed
with a million tiny wrinkles the
eyes were dark blue deeply set al-
most cavernous and burning with
a feverish fire which set at naught
the calm slow dignity of the ges-
ticulations with which he embel-
lished his remarks what struck me
as most strange of all however was
the lack of moisture upon his brow
in that unseasonable clothing after
that tussle up the slope he should
have been literally wringing with
sweat as we were and yet so far as
the city of glass



i could see there was not a solitary
drop on him

  and thus as we talked a strange
thing happened i began to have an
unaccountable fit of drowsiness-a
peculiar heavy feeling about the eyes
and an almost overwhelming desire
to sit down glancing over at con-
stance lome i saw her rub her eyes
and yawn and then an instant later
she sank slowly toward the earth
oddly enough this strange behavior
astounded me not at all and perhaps
i should have passed off in a like
manner had i not glanced down to
azors hand and saw there for the
first time a small reddish bulb which
he was squeezing between his fingers
from the mouth of it there issued a
colorless vapor which disappeared
immediately in the air then in a
flash i realized what was happening

  were being drugged i shout-
ed its something in that devils
hand

  i made a lunge at him but some-
how my limbs seemed to have grown
suddenly leaden and dragged me
slowly to earth while the sun and
the heavens and the hills above me
swirled gradually around and then
sank into deep darkness

 awoke to find myself between
warm sheets on a soft bed in a
great chamber with a high domelike
ceiling for a time my eyes wan-
dered about taking in with bewilder-
ment the sumptuous furnishings-
the thick rugs on the floor the huge
overstuffed chairs the plump be-pil-
lowed divan in the far corner at
the head of my bed was a small table
on the smoothly polished surface of
which stood a huge bowl of fruit-
oranges pears grapes dates and
bananas of a size and color i had
never seen before the air was sul-
try and heavy with odors sweet al-
most to the point of nausea pulling
myself out of bed i found my feet
sinking into the thick carpets as in

dense woodland moss the room as
i then noticed had no windows the
soft glowing light that suffused it be-
ing let in from the ceiling which i
now recognized as translucent glass
from the ceiling my eyes wandered
back to the walls and thence to the
floor and even these as i could see
now were of an opaque glass in-
deed there was scarcely an object in
the room which was not of the same
smooth material even the frame of
the bed the table and such parts of
the furniture as were not covered
with thick padding only the rugs
the hangings and the bedding were
of other material and these were of
a texture i did not recognize

  made suddenly aware of a tremen-
dous appetite i bit into one of the
huge peaches finding it of a super-
sweetness entranced at first by its
flavor i proceeded to devour it with
great gusto but before i was more
than half-way through the sickly
sweetness of it suddenly palled on me
and i was obliged to throw it aside
then i tried one of the oranges hop-
ing for something tart its taste dif-
fering from the peach pleased me at
first but pleasure soon passed to sur-
feit and surfeit quickly to nausea

  suddenly through the steamy sul-
triness of the atmosphere there came
to me an overwhelming desire to
breathe the cool clear air of the great
out-of-doors there was something
depressing almost loathsome here a
window to be opened-no there were
none the door then i saw its out-
line at the farther end of the room
i tried the curiously fashioned glass
knob but it was evidently fastened
from the outside and yielded not a
tremor to my irritated pull

  i walked back to my bedside noting
for the first time then that on the
small table near its head there was a
button not unlike the electric push-
buttons familiar in my own country
i pushed it and waited


weikd tales

 presently the door opened and
azor appeared followed by three
others obviously servants and yet
like himself in that they gave the im-
pression of being at once young and
yet very old on their arms they car-
ried several garments apparently in-
tended for me azor had now cast
aside his furlike apparel and had
clothed himself in a loosely hung tu-
nic of velvet or thickly woven silk

  whats the game i demanded

  he did not answer and i saw that
he was puzzled by my slang expres-
sion

  why have we been kidnapped in
this high-handed manner i asked
assuming an air of offended dignity
which although foreign to me
seemed more in keeping with the oc-
casion

  you are lucky to be alive he
returned had you come at this
time a year ago before we atlanteans
had decided to make our great ex-
periment you would have perished
before you ever reached the outlying
hills

  you talk in riddles i exclaimed
tartly tell me are professor
lome and his daughter and penfield
alive

  they are all alive and well he
replied all of them revived from
the effects of the drug several days
ago you have been somewhat tardy
miss lome and her father are con-
fined in another part of the palace
your companion penfield is in an
adjoining chamber and you my
friend are here

  so i perceive i returned dryly
perhaps you are ready to give some
explanation of this-this high-handed
proceeding i assure you that when
my government hears of this-

  he shrugged his narrow shoulders
you are quite beyond any help
which may come from your govern-
ment perhaps we gave you too much
of the drug but we had our orders
to bring you in quite unblemished

you are a lucky man my friend the
queen of atlantis has come in here
during your slumbers she has seen
you and approved of you

  thanks to her said i with as
much irony as i could muster and
now this talk of experiments what
of it i confess that up until this
moment i was convinced that i was
dealing with a madman

  since i have been instructed to
apprize you of all that has happened
and what is to happen he contin-
ued then i may as well begin here
and now you my young friend are
privileged to see what no other man
from your world has seen before you
more than that you are to take an
active and if i may say it a pleas-
ant part in the physical rejuvenation
of the people of atlantis

  then this is atlantis after all
and professor lome was right

  more right than he could have
dreamed of he expected to find a
deserted city in the desert instead
he has found igifha the crystal city
inhabited by a race of beings who
have brought their civilization to a
point far surpassing any which your
own has attained or ever will attain

  	 thirty centuries ago atlantis
and all the people whom you shall see
here were already alive we were
then the favored of earths nations
living in luxury on the shores of the
mediterranean sea near the pillar of
hercules warned by our gods of
an impending eataclysm which
should shake this great continent
from end to end we fled with our
goods and chattels inland moving as
far south as this our present abode

  several hundreds of years before
this time our scientists who were
then as now advanced far beyond
those of any other peoples discovered
an elixir the drinker of which is
rendered immune from any save
violent death fortunately or per-
haps unfortunately after we had al-
ready drank of it giving us a virtual
the city of glass



immortality we discovered that al-
though we were provided with what
promised to be eternal life we had de-
prived ourselves of the power of pro-
creating our race in other words
the elixir acted with a double po-
tency it removed the necessity of
our having children by making our
race immortal but at the same time
as a kind of recompense it removed
our power of producing children
there are no children in atlantis
those who drank the elixir while still
young grew to adults and have so
remained all of us are centuries
old i wras a patriarch when greece
was young my hair was white when
plato was born i have seen the sev-
en cities of troy each in the heyday
of its power i heard homer sing
his way through the anatolian cities
i knewr alexander and i saw the
burning of tyre

  naturally we came with the
passing of time to be old men so
satiated with the ways of the world
where nothing wras new to us that
we were glad to wander back to our
homeland to live out our years in
peace beside the gently flowing
stream of time for centuries now
none of us has put foot beyond
those northern hills the spot where
i and my band came upon you sev-
eral days ago is as far north-in
fact as far awray from klifha-as
any of us have been in more than
nine hundred years

   i said wre are immortal to any ex-
cept violent death that is not ex-
actly correct our scientists have
noted during the past three centuries
that the potency of the elixir which
takes the place of blood in our veins
is gradually weakening some of us
are aging more under the hand of
time than wre should three of our
number the oldest in way of centu-
ries are on the verge of death years
will yet pass before they perish but
we know nevertheless that the end
for them is at hand

  now we have held communion
with ourselves during the past fifty
years as to what shall be done the
elixir is gone we have lost the secret
of its preparation but our scientists
are of the opinion that they could
readily produce it again should we so
desire but we are convinced that
we do not care to go on longer as we
have gone on life when it is count-
ed by the centuries even witli our
luxury and diversion grows heavy on
our hands we are sated esthetes
epicureans sybarites if you will
our knowledge matured by the cen-
turies has provided us with every
pleasure we have indulged our ap-
petites played to the whims of our
senses until these senses are fast ap-
proaching the state where they can
no longer be prodded into giving us
pleasure our scientists say that the
sense of taste and smell is gradually
perishing the odor of the common
lily the nectar of the ordinary fruit
pleases our palates no longer in
this sunny land of ours by means of
our great knowledge we have kept
pace with our dying senses by in-
creasing the size and odors of our
flowers and the sweetness of our
fruits these have been developed and
increased to the last degree we are
reaching the point where our knowl-
edge can serve us no longer when
these senses fail entirely life will
then be but an empty husk imprison-
ing a soul which wtould be happier in
death

  that is why i broke in those
fruits are too sweet for me i cant
eat them they sicken me

  quite so he replied and
even at that on the advice of our
scientists we gave you only the lesser
of our fruits he leaned over
seized a peach and bit into it just
as i thought this peach which is
too sweet for you is absolutely with-
out taste to me i could get as much
satisfaction from a bit of grass


weird tales

  if you are so fed up with life
here said i why dont you go
back into the world from which i
come and find new adventure and
interest there

  he held up his hands in mock hor-
ror the gods spare us that he
exclaimed could we who have
gone so far beyond you find any-
thing there which could interest us
bah you are children where we are
grown men pigmies where we are
giants your meanness awakens our
contempt and even your virtues
are so puny that they call up in our
breasts no admiration were it not
so we would have been back among
you centuries ago could we live on
the tasteless husks which are food to
you could we play your silly
games could we appreciate your
spineless philosophy could we
whittle down our lives to your puny
loves and pale hates the gods for-
bid i say again

tut there is another reason per-
haps the most important of all
why we do not return your land is
too cold our blood is gone we need
an even more than equatorial heat for
our comfort even outside this land
of ours in the desert where i came
upon you you were sweltering but i
was cold

  but here said i it can be no
warmer than the equator

    there you are wrong again this
particular room is cooler than any
other because it is to our purpose to
keep you healthy and comfortable
we have arranged special apparatus
for that reason and your clothing
has been chemically treated in order
to aid you to stand the excessive heat
and moisture which you find here
but outside your room this city
huge as it is is completely surround-
ed and under a dome of glass the
rays of the sun and the lack of cool-
ing breezes intensify the heat to a
point which is desirable to us

  then you are really a hothouse
people i exclaimed

  we might be described as such
but to get back to the point toward
which i was tending when you inter-
rupted as i said we are surfeited
with life we are gradually dying
now in this case there are but two
things to do we must either redis-
cover the immortalizing elixir or we
must rejuvenate ourselves in some
other way revitalizing ourselves
with the elixir is unthinkable aye
abhorrent we should simply be do-
ing what we have done before there
would be no adventure in that and
moreover we should be calling down
upon ourselves another eternity of
years during which with our pleas-
ure senses dead there would be no
joy left on earth for us facing us
then there would be only suieide

 

  but you say you are immortal-
or nearly so i interjected

  you forget that i said we could
die only by violent death he cor-
rected but having no wish to re-
vitalize ourselves with the immortal-
ity elixir we are going to do another
thing we are going to revitalize our-
selves with the blood of our cap-
tives

  you cold-blooded villains i
shouted springing to my feet and
striding toward him

  have a care he cautioned i
have a means of handling you against
which even your burly strength can
not avail have a care and listen to
what i say this is not as you seem
to think a scheme for killing you
sucking you dry of your blood in
fact quite the opposite it is our
wholehearted desire that you shall
live and be healthy by all the gods
have you not guessed it yet it is
common enough in your own world  

  i was puzzled for a moment and
then his meaning came to me with a
rush you mean i cried that
the city of glass



you expect us to unite with your peo-
ple and-

  yes he put in thats just it-
your women and our men your men
and our women we are indeed for-
tunate in having such likely speci-
mens tumble into our hands you
owe your lives to your comely appear-
ance and good health the old pro-
fessor will of course not go for
much but he may be valuable as a
study

  and then for the first time the ter-
rible thought crashed through-i say
crashed through for it seemed to
come to my consciousness in no other
way constance lome in the hands
of these loathsome bloodless brutes

  azor must have read my thoughts
for he interjected you need have
no scruples on that score we atlan-
teans wish you well and shall accom-
modate ourselves to any religious
ceremony which may be considered
indispensable by you and they are
not all so old and perhaps so unat-
tractive in appearance as i the
queen will undoubtedly choose you
and she to say the least is more
beautiful-aye far more beautiful-
than even this woman in your own
party

  i wasnt thinking of myself i
replied but the professors daugh-
ter miss lome-surely you-

  she has already been spoken for
and promised he snapped a sud-
den strange irritation in his voice
she is to marry one of the nobles
the highest in the land she will
either marry him-or perish in the
moat it is her choice

  damn you i snarled getting to
my feet and standing over him i
believe you had spoken for her your-
self you hoary-headed blaekguard
but thank heaven there was some-
body here with more power than
you

  it is so he said getting up and
facing me a queer flicker in his sunk-
en eyes i had spoken for her and

she would have been fortunate had
my request been granted as it is
now she goes to kreggox beside
whom in natural beauty i am as one
of the lilies of the field

  i would have laughed at this re-
mark had this been any laughing
matter i began to revolve the thing
in my mind as i stood there so the
queen had ehosen me eh i had
found favor in her sight best now
to play the game for a while on my
ability to fool her might depend our
slim chance of escape very well i
would play antony to her cleopatra
for whatever the gods should see fit
to bring forth

  get into this elothing azor
directed

  seeing nothing better to do i
pulled on the tunic which was of a
thickish material and yet cool and
light to the skin sandals of what
appeared to be pure gold and a great
belt studded with jewels completed
the costume when i was prepared
he bade me follow him to the door
the servants bringing up the rear for
it was plain azor did not trust me

  as the door opened a warm blast
heavily laden with perfume smote
my nostrils for the instant i almost
staggered under the nauseating
sweetness of it but i recovered in a
moment and followed him out upon
the terrace here a strange sight
met my eyes

  we were high up on a kind of plat-
form which surrounded the palace
towers glancing down my eye took
in a scene which at first reminded
me of the pictures i had seen in my
old school geography it was an
ideal landscape of the carboniferous
age except that here and there were
buildings of divergent size and
shape all of them shining out like
faceted diamonds under the hot yel-
low rays of the sun below us i saw
other and lesser towers all of a part-
ly transparent material which was
surely glass these in turn dropped


weird tales

away to grassy terraces broken here
and there by glistening pathways and
great staircases piled like pyramids
of salt against the green beyond
obviously these were the palace
grounds and gardens in them
towering half the height of the lowest
turrets were gargantuan trees of a
kind i had never seen before their
trunks and limbs festooned graceful-
ly with hanging moss and creepers
here and there silvery fountains shot
egret plumes of water heavenward
and now and then one caught the
elusive gleam of statuary among the
trees

  that said azor pointing with
a gnarled finger downward is the
palace garden beyond to the left is
the great horticultural experimenting
station wrhich is really a city of glass
within itself far below on the next
gentle rise you can see the walls of
the city houses shining through the
trees

 looked and saw them each cut in
the same glistening material which
either shot the reflected rays of the
sun back into our eyes or shattered
them into a thousand shimmering
rainbows in the streets below

  all glass said azor some
steel of course you see that hemi-
spherical structure there in the dis-
tance that great spherical piece
elevated on stilts as it were  that is
the source of all our power we have
harnessed the rays of the sun we
have a gigantic sun-glass there more
than a hundred feet in thickness
the suns rays striking through it
are concentrated and reflected
against great metal boilers filled with
water these in turn produce steam
to run our dynamos the sun-glass
turns easily and in time of day may
be used as a wreapon any enemy
caught in that beam would be imme-
diately reduced to cinders

  you are helpless then during the
night said i

  not at all the electrical energy
generated during the day is stored in
great batteries with these we are
able to hurl thunderbolts of a poten-
tiality only slightly less than you
have seen in your own heavens

  but you spoke of using metal
what metal can withstand such heat
and how do you get it  

  we use steel especially treated to
withstand terrific temperatures we
make it from iron in much the same
way that you do but wre get our iron
from the skies by means of power-
ful electro-magnets wre can draw me-
teors out of the heavens most of
these are of pure iron working it
up into steel without the necessity of
smelting it is a simple matter

  how is it said i thinking of it
for the first time that you know
so much of our world wthich you have
not visited in so many centuries
why you even speak english and

 j

  we speak all languages he re-
plied the acquisition of knowl-
edge has been one of our diversions
we have also developed the radio
and listen in on all of your petty
conversations and wre have studied
you and your habits through our
great telescopes hence we were pre-
pared to capture you as soon as we
saw that you wrere most surely headed
into our own country but come we
have dallied here long enough

  he glanced at a strange timepiece
which he pulled from his belt

  yes it is now nearing the hour
when you are to have your first audi-
ence with the queen if you are
wise-he seemed to be putting a
strange emphasis on his words now
peering up into my face with those
feverish eyes of his-if you are
wise you will see to it that you find
favor with her and finding it you
may be able to benefit by my friend-
ship it is just possible that you and
i may find-may find a mutual ben-
efit in aiding each other 
the city of glass



  he turned then on his heel while
i followed pondering his words
we may find a mutual benefit in
aiding each other had the little
man some purpose in his obvious at-
tempts at kindness to me  con-
stance lome of course there was
disaffection here and  with disaffec-
tion i might profit very well to it
then i would play the game

  i followed him down a broad flight
of stairs turned and found myself at
the end of a long wide corridor
stretching off into a magnificent vista
of rich hangings intricate mosaics
and brilliant tapestries a varicol-
ored light was furnished by the sun
striking through the high vaulted
roof splitting into the spectrum and
deluging everything in a shower of
gold red violet and blue with half a
hundred intermittent tints so it
seemed to me there were bits of ex-
quisite statuary here some of it black
as ebony but most of it of what i took
to be white marble but azor said was
an especially treated glass present-
ly we stepped out of the great corri-
dor down a flight of gracefully curv-
ing steps into a narrower passageway
there were tiny alcoves here backed
by colored glass as i went along i
saw someone seated in one of them a
strange figure for it was that of a
man bathed in a bloody glow from
the ruby panes behind him there
was something familiar about him
and i looked a second time and
then i started forward my hand out-
stretched in greeting

  it was penfield

  well what are you doing here
and how are you feeling i cried

  he ignored my outstretched hand
gazing up at me out of black-rimmed
eyes in which i saw points of strange-
ly flickering fires his appearance
shocked me i recoiled appalled at
the change in him and we stood there
for a moment with no word he star-
ing up into my face and i gazing
down into his

  are you ill i demanded

      at heart   he answered   but
she is beautiful

  you have seen constance i
whispered bending nearer

  constance i said nothing of
constance i spoke of the queen-
the queen of atlantis

  did i not tell you whispered
azor in my ear he has seen her
behold the result it is her beauty  
i took penfield by the arm but he
shook me off glaring malevolently tfp
into my eyes you have not seen
her yet or you too would speak of
her as i do then he stretched out
his hand and i felt his steel-springed
fingers sinking into my arm lis-
ten said he his breath now hot on
my cheek   listen garth if she
chooses you then by god i shall kill
you  

  you are mad i cried pulling
away from him

    mad for love of her   he croaked
but constance lome i pro-
tested

  damn constance and damn you
he screamed then brushing me
suddenly aside he turned and ran
swiftly down the corridor i stood
there gazing after him in amaze-
ment until azor plucked me by the
arm the little man touched his
wrinkled forehead significantly

  reason has fled he said quiet-
ly we took him to the queen yes-
terday today he is insane

  this is horrible

  it is better for him he will
suffer less

  and so we went on down the cor-
ridor

wynona queen of atlantis

 imagine a woman with a figure
slightly larger than medium hips
and bust tending toward the voluptu-
ous and a neck like the stalk of a lily
on which blossomed a flower as fair
as the immortal helen eyes a deep
blue yet burning with that same


weird tales

feverish fire i had remarked in the
eyes of her subjects nose straight
and grecian drooping mouth surely
voluptuous and certainly cruel but
if the fire in her eyes was like that of
her subjects here the resemblance
ended at least for such of them as i
had seen her skin was white as ala-
baster but lacked that sickly putty-
ish hue which was in them a sure
characteristic and hers was the first
face free of that fine network of
wrinkles i had seen in atlantis aye
she was beautiful

  we sat together in a tiny alcove in
her glass-enclosed garden while birds
of brilliant plumage sang about us
and the water plashed softly in the
fountains near by from afar off
scarcely within earshot came strains
of soft music weird yet strangely
sweet and yet somehow the thing
nauseated me from the beginning
once she bent near me and the heavy
perfume from her dark hair deluged
my senses so that for a moment my
purpose reeled and i half reached out
my hand to seize her naked arm

  but she was a woman even in at-
lantis with the mists of thirty cen-
turies behind her and so being a
woman she pretended to play the
game as other women have played it
and are playing and will play it un-
til the stars grow cold she pulled
away from me coyly in that quick
moment my reeling senses snapped
together and reason bolstered pur-
pose once again god how humid
the air how heavy this eternal per-
fume and these fountains splash-
ing their never-ending music and
the birds what would i not have
given at that moment for the homely
chatter of the humble hedge-sparrow
and a sight of constance lome
pink-cheeked and yellow-haired and-
firm-fleshed

  the queen must have noticed a sud-
den wave of disgust in my face for
she turned to me and said you are
not happy here

  and i fool that i was i forgot i
was there to play the game i burst
out no let me go to my friends
let me go to constance lome take
penfield my companion he is mad
for you already my thoughts are
elsewhere

  too late i realized my mistake she
had just given me proof that she
was very much a woman as i knew
women and yet i had been fool
enough to speak my preference for
another in her face and that on
the very heels of something which
had been entirely different when i
reached out my hand for her hell
as i was shortly to learn has no fury
like a woman scorned she sprang
to her feet and stood gazing down at
me her eyes blazing like twin stars in
the gathering dusk

   so that is it  she cried bending
down until i felt her hot perfumed
breath on my forehead know then
that she is not for you by all the
gods this very night she shall go to
kreggor he has asked and i have
delayed but i shall delay no longer
and so after that perhaps she will
live less in your dreams  

 she will never go to him i
shouted in desperation

    then she shall be fed to the
crocodiles in the moat she an-
swered her eyes taking on new fury
let her choose and know that you
have forced the choice

  with that she wheeled suddenly
came the vift rush of sandaled feet
and she had disappeared in an open-
ing of the shrubbery

  i sat there sick at heart with what
i had done dusk deepened to dark-
ness the far-distant music ceased
the birds fluttered through the foli-
age to their nocturnal perches only
the never-ending splash of the foun-
tains remained and these seeming
now to have lost their music rang
against my ears like the clash of dis-
cordant cymbals presently i felt a
hand on my shoulder and looking up
the city of glass

in the gloom saw azor standing
above me

 you have been eavesdropping
you devil i snarled though i did
not know why i should have cared if
he had

  i heard it all he replied frank-
ly now listen i have something to
say to you you still have within
your reach a chance to save this
lorne woman of yours i had count-
ed at first on your companion pen-
field but his reason will not stand
the test we shall be overheard here
the very walls have ears in atlantis
follow me quietly

there being nothing else to do i
followed azor through the shrub-
bery here there was a narrow flight
of stairs leading down to a small
door which he opened carefully to
only a crack before going in the
place was apparently empty for he
pushed it wide then and signed me
to follow him once beyond the door
i found myself in a huge room so
large and broad that i could not see
its farther walls through the dusk
and the thick green shrubbery near
by were large glass cases filled with
earth in which were curious plants
most of them strangely stunted

  this is the royal horticultural
experimental chamber began azor
the workers have left for the day
so we shall be unmolested and now
to begin  

  he drew me by the am across the
floor to a glass case raised on a plat-
form between two huge potted ferns
glancing down upon it i saw through
the glass several rows of tiny mush-
rooms or toadstools together with
bits of decayed wood on which tiny
lichens were growing

 you have bungled it badly
continued azor as we leaned over the
glass together and yet all is not
lost but we must act quickly be-
cause the lome woman is in immin-
ent danger the queen has held off

on kreggors request for several
days though she has promised her to
him but i think without doubt she
will give the order this night in
fact i doubt not that it is already
given kreggor however will try
nothing until midnight or there-
abouts so we have some time for
our plans to work

  drawing closer to me he readied
within his tunic and pulled out a
long glistening dagger the handle of
which he pressed into my hand it
is of glass he whispered but
quite unbreakable you must be
doubly careful for the tip the point
is dipped in deadly poison sink that
but once into kreggors body yes
only so much as scratch him with it
and constance lome is saved

  i took the weapon from him half
fancying for the moment to plunge
it into his own shriveled breast but
i remembered immediately that i
should have further need of him and
so he lived

  listen carefully he admonished
as i hid the blade under my tunic
constance lorne is in the great
eastern towrer the tallest of them all
and the last to the east except one
kreggors apartments are next west
and there is of course a connecting
corridor between now there is no
wav for you to go to her aid from the
inside of the palace because kreggor
will have the corridor well guarded
by his henchmen and by electrical
paraphernalia which would mean cer-
tain death to you should you encoun-
ter it a suspicious man is kreggor
and so therefore you must scale the
outer walls and enter her chamber
through a door which opens into
kreggors corridor  

  but the walls are smooth they
are glass i objected a fly could
not cling there

  do not interrupt me he replied
testily i have means i have
means


weird tales

  he tapped the glass surface at his
elbow with a nervous finger you
see here he continued pointing to
the fungus below one of the swift-
est-growing and most virulent plants
in atlantis it is a development of
your own common toadstool but ow-
ing to the peculiar atmosphere and
great age of everything in which it
finds root here its growing powers
have gone far beyond anything you
have ever dreamed of in your own
world the specimens in this ease
are purposely stunted by bacteria
which we have placed in there to feed
upon their roots otherwise we should
soon be overrun and driven from our
own abode but now should you
for instance drop a spore from one
of these plants in the moist earth at
the foot of the eastern tower wherein
your friends are confined there
would be in a very few moments a
huge growth towering as high and
perhaps higher than the loftiest of
the towers

  he bent nearer now the peculiar
feverish fire in his eyes blazing out
with renewed fervor

  your task is this he continued
it is necessary for you to scale the
eastern tower wall from the grounds
outside now i shall give you one of
these seeds and you are to drop it in
the soil close to the wall you
must then act quickly for this
spore will sprout almost immediate-
ly and the growth will be shoulder-
high before you realize what has hap-
pened therefore when you see the
club-head of the plant rising out of
the turf before you hesitate not so
much as a second but climb upon it
you can hold yourself in place with-
out fear of falling by cutting holes in
the thick pulp to which you can
cling clinging there you will be car-
ried immediately aloft as the plant
pushes upward as you pass the
rotunda  the last turret jump from
the plant following the rotunda
around to the west you will find a

door leading into the great corridor
which separates the apartments of
kreggor and constance lorne con-
ceal yourself behind the hangings
sometime during the night kreggor
will come by alone then you are to
strike swiftly and surely that there
may be no outcry for upon your si-
lence depends your life after that
you may make your way back here as
best you can and i will conceal you
until we know better what we can
do

  he opened a drawer beneath the
case and took out a small glass jar
pushing his fingers through the wide
mouth he seized something there and
then passed it to me it was already
so dark that so far as i could see
there was nothing in his hand but
on his admonition to look closer i saw
lying on the tip of his finger a white
speck of powder a mushroom spore
reaching up he tore a leaf from a
near-by twig and wrapping the spore
within passed it to me

  youd best give me several said
i this one may be sterile i shant
have time to come back for more

  i shall give you no more he
said firmly turning away as a
matter of fact i am risking much in
giving you even the one the growth
will develop-spores immediately upon
its maturity-say in half an hour
the spores will be scattered and in an
hour or so the palace lawn will be
thick with them i am hoping that
someone will notice the growths and
give the alarm before they have gone
beyond our control otherwise we
shall be hard put to it to win back the
garden from being completely over-
run i can tell you truly that there
is more danger to us packed in a
single one of those glass bottles than
would be in a ton of your dynamite
each battle contains spores from all
manner of virulent fungi once these
were loosed in atlantis and hell it-
self could not prevail against them
the city of glass



 when do we start i asked
coming up behind him he had for-
gotten to close the drawer and now
i had a bottle of the powdery spores
concealed beneath my tunic

  in two hours from now return
to your chamber i shall come for
you when it is time

  as i followed him back through
the winding corridors i saw a figure
lurking in one of the alcoves glanc-
ing a second time and going partly
out of my way to make sure i saw
that it was penfield i called out to
him then but he made no sign of
recognition

it was perhaps an hour before mid-
night when my chamber door
opened in almost ghostly fashion and
azor came in his somber robes and
hood under the subdued glow of the
lights giving him the appearance of
some huge bird of ill omen over his
arm was a garment similar to the one
which enveloped his own shriveled
figure and into this he bade me draw
myself as soon as possible pointing
out that i ran less risk of being seen
when clothed in black

 you must hurry he admon-
ished i have it on good authority
that kreggor will act by midnight
he has other business to occupy him
until then

  again we hurried down the innu-
merable flights of stairs most of the
lights had been extinguished in the
palace at this hour but here and
there a dim globe made weird shad-
ows among the palms and statuary
which lined the corridors finally
azor opened a small door and step-
ping to one side pointed out into the
darkness

  follow this pathway said he
it leads directly to the eastern
towers plant your spore at the foot
of the second and largest you cant
mistake it i can not go farther for
my presence is required elsewhere
and my absence would be noticed

good luck to you as they say in your
country  

  he held out a shriveled claw but i
did not take it somehow even then
i did not feel that i could trust him
out of my sight he was aiding me
to save constance lome but only to
serve his own desires for the mo-
ment we were bound together by a
common purpose but that afforded
me no delusions once that purpose
had been served and he would use
every means in his power to destroy
me

  i sped out into the night along the
glass pathway under the towering
shrubbery and lofty palms here
and there festoons of moss hanging
down wiped me gently across the face
like ghostly fingers seeking my iden-
tity the air was sultry as usual
happily not quite so warm as during
the day but now it reeked more than
ever with dampness and heavy odor
once i slipped on the smooth glass
underfoot and my legs shooting out
from under me plunged my body to
the hips in the dripping growths
which lined the pathway came a
dull cracking as of rotten wood and
then a renewed flood of odor more
sickly sweet than i have ever smelled
before peering ahead in the gloom
i saw that i had crashed into a bow-
er of roses the blooms tremendous
growths like cabbagc bobbed above
me in silent mockery for the first
time now even the thrill of ap-
proaching danger left me and i felt
the full thrust of a loathing which
until now had stirred but faintly in
my breast

  god what a country nauseating
sweetness warm clinging moisture
and a night full of lusts and hatreds

  i took the path again something
glided across my path and into the
trees it was a huge reptile and i
started back in horror but remem-
bered then that azor had said these
were palace pets and quite harmless
now a monster toad hopped to the


weird tales

middle of the pathway and stood
there glaring up at me with its basi-
lisk eyes knowing the thing was
harmless and yet full of loathing i
quickened my speed and leaped high
in the air clearing its slimy up-
turned head by many inches

  the breathless miasma of the great
honeysuckles clinging to the wall on
my left now deluged me my senses
fairly reeled under the blanketing
heaviness of it god for a breath of
clean dry desert air

  and then my sixth sense pricked
me-the swift unerring conscious-
ness of impending danger what was
that a footfall behind me i
paused again it came now the
crack of a rotting bough under hu-
man foot now a swift patter no
toad or reptile that

  i paused my pursuer paused also
i walked forward slowly he did
likewise i turned and ran back
his receding footsteps sounded in my
ears and then it came to me i was
being stalked-stalked here in the
dripping sultriness of the night
stalked by someone who followed
close betraying his presence with
careless feet and yet delaying the at-
tack if it were an atlantean why
did he not cry out and give the alarm 
surely there were enough of his com-
patriots close at hand within these
very walls

  and yet i had no time to stalk
him as he was stalking me the pre-
cious moments flew azor had said
there should be no delay for danger
gathered with every tick of the clock
about the head of the woman in the
great eastern tower kreggor what
sort of monster was he kreggor
constance in kreggors arms push
on push on

  i found myself muttering these
words aloud in the night i broke in-
to a half-run and my pursuer ran
also and then i came to a small
canal over which there was an ornate
glass bridge looking to the left i

saw that the canal wound away and
disappeared among the palace towers
probably to connect eventually with
the city moat by now the one be-
hind me was nearer still i fancied
i could hear his labored breathing
and yet the night was so thick under
those overhanging moss-grown limbs
that i could see nothing behind me
the opposite end of the bridge freo
from the leafy roof overhead was
bathed in the wan eery light of a
waning moon i crossed over and on
the other side found a small shrub
near a statue in the shadow of which
i resolved to await the man who fol-
lowed the best i could imagine was
that it must be azor who would bo
trailing me ready to cut me down as
soon as i had slain his enemy kreg-
gor and so thinking this i made
up my mind that i should kill azor
first

  as he came out of the shadows
which hid the farther end of the nar-
row causeway i rushed out and met
him beneath the moon midway the
bridge my dagger lifted upward
ready to strike him down muffled
though he was in his midnight cloak
he was quick and lithe and in a mo-
ment we were locked together each
holding the weapon hand of the
other then he writhed suddenly in
my grasp tore away his arm and
raised it to strike looking upward
i saw it glistening in the moonlight
-a glass dagger the very twin of my
own the movement tore the hood
from his face and the moon laid its
wan light across his features

  it was colin penfield

  i dropped my own weapon then
and seized his upraised arm in both
my hands you fool i whispered
in suppressed fury it is i garth
hold up until i explain

  i will kill you garth he mut-
tered trying to wrench his hand
away you shall never leave this
place alive i will kill you you
the city of glass



were the chosen one but when they
find you here in the morning-

  his voice trailed off into a mani-
acal shriek of laughter that split the
murky stillness about us and then
i knew he must be surely mad-mad
for wynona queen of atlantis

  still for constance lomes sake i
tried to reason with him as we swayed
together on the brink of the canal the
murky waters below waiting only to
swallow one or the other of us-or
both

  somehow then he tried to wrench
himself free and we slipped on the
glassy incline he going down with
me on top his skull struck the path-
way with a resounding thump and
the glass knife clattered to the
ground beside us i kicked it back-
ward far from his reach and
breathed easier now that its deadly
point no longer threatened

  i believe that blow restored his
reason for the moment-but only for
the moment he sat up looking from
me to the glass parapet and then
around us to the strange shadows
etched by the moonlight on the walls
of the palace

  it-it was that villain azor he
mumbled he set me to tracking
you told me to kill you when you
had made away with-with that at-
lantean up there-kreggor he called
him i was to wait until you had
done the job-and then-with that

poisoned dagger-

   so that was it azor was playing
both ends against the middle how
simple it all was afraid to kill
kreggor himself and still more afraid
to kill me the chosen one of the
queen he had planned that i should
make away with kreggor and be in
my turn slain obviously as the result
of a jealous quarrel with penfield a
solution of his problem which would
entail no awkward explanations

  come i said to penfield get
up we have work to do tonight 

  i helped him to his feet and he

stood gazing up at the moon then
he pointed upward

  i see her there-it is her face-
wynona-wynona wait im com-
ing  im coming  

  i would have acted quicker had i
realized his reason had fled once
more as it was he shook me off
with that madmans strength of his
and sprang up on the parapet of the
causeway stretching his arms to-
ward the moon he stepped or rather
threw himself over it all came in
the flash of an eye-his quick leap to
the wall my own cry of consterna-
tion  his outstretched arms-and
then a splash

  there came a second splash and
then a single scream that was all
running to the parapet i gazed over
the side then leaped to its edge and
prepared to dive there were ghost-
ly ripples on the oily surface but
nothing more i waited a second to
see his head reappear but nothing
broke that still slimy surface

  and then just as i poised for the
dive something shot out of the shad-
ows beyond moving swiftly toward
me for a moment i thought it
was a log propelled by a push from
some unseen hand beneath the bridge
or perhaps released from the ooze of
the bottom by the crash of penfields
body

  and then my limbs froze with hor-
ror no log that it was a croco-
dile

  now i spied another and still an-
other floating toward me their lid-
less eyes gazing up at me with hungry
expectation the moon silvered
them now until they stood out in
ghastly outline against the murk
about them on the jaws of one i
thought i saw a blotch it was green-
ish black under the moon but i knew
that with the light of day upon it
its color would be red and so i
stumbled from the parapet and stag-
gered along the pathway sick with
the miasmatic horror of this hideous


weird tales

night and then i think that i too
went a little mad

t came now to the tower which i
knew from azors description
must be the one imprisoning con-
stance lorne the thick overgrowth
from the trees again shut out the
light of the moon so i had to grope
my way along the dripping walls
drawing back with horror as my
hands encountered some huge noc-
turnal beetle or the fat gelatinous
body of some oozing snail here was
the second tower and the point at its
base which azor had recommended
for the planting of the spore glanc-
ing upward i thought i caught a
gleam of light coming through the
trees it might be from the tower-
it seemed too concentrated to come
from the moon

   and then there drifted down from
those dizzy heights above a scream-
a womans scream faint but unmis-
takable-it was the voice of con-
stance lorne

   reaching into my tunic i pulled
out the folded leaf unrolled it and
brushed it into the moss and ferns at
my feet the speck of powder that
wtas the mushroom spore it must
have taken root almost simultaneous-
ly with its touching earth for in that
very moment a great blunt head
ghostly gray in the darkness arose
beside me startled even though i
had been prepared by azor i fell
back in a moment more the thing
was waist-high and i knew that i
must act seizing the club-head of
the plant i drove my knife into its
pulpy sides hollowing out handholds
and footholds with swift strikes an-
other instant and i had mounted it
crouching on its massive head for
a time it wobbled drunkenly and i
was afraid my weight would snap the
stem but presently it steadied and
pushed itself onward up-up the
limb of a tree interfered now but i
hacked a way through it the sticky

soft bark crumbling easily under the
feverish strokes of my knife two
limbs now to hack through and we
should be free the festoons of moss
on the last twining their slimy ten-
drils about my body nearly dragged
me from my perch and i cut and
slashed at them with the frenzy of a
madman we pushed upward through
the last and into the moonlight

  close at hand quite within touch
was the ghostly wall of the palace
smooth and free of the growths that
encumbered it below from above
nothing but silence now no by
heaven another scream and the run-
ning of feet almost insane with im-
patience i got to my knees and in
peril of slipping from my precarious
perch gazed upward yes there was
a light there now eame another
scream and a mans heavy voice cry-
ing something in the atlantean
tongue then a harsh snarl the
sound of a blow and coarse laughter

  up and up i went now the hor-
rifying thought struck me suppose
the plant stunted by my weight
should not thrust high enough and i
should be marooned there helpless in
full view of the palace  now up an-
other ten feet the growth was sure-
ly slackening in speed was it ap-
proaching its limit the parapet was
almost within reach of my hands

  heedless of the danger of falling i
scrambled to my feet and reached up-
ward yes my hands eurled over the
parapet edge kicking my feet free
of their holds i pulled myself upward
and swung a leg over my feet struck
the hard glass rotunda just as an-
other scream split the stillness the
huge growth relieved of my weight
pushed upward like a ghost of the
night

  now another scream there was a
window on the farther bulge of the
turret wall a large oval of trans-
parent glass racing to it i peered
within what i saw there sent the
blood swirling into my temples anew
the city of glass



and the white wall before me turned
to red

  constance lome was crouching
behind an overturned table at the far
end of the room in front of her
with his back to me was a huge
gnomelike creature a monstrous head
on a spindling neck great fatty
body on short spindling legs and tre-
mendous hairy arms reaching out
over the table like the suckers of a
devil-fish azor had spoken truly
beside this creature confronting con-
stance lorne azor was as a lily of
the field

  even as i watched in petrified
horror he reached one of those hairy
arms out to her and his coarse laugh-
ter rang out on the air she screamed
again and pushing the table against
him ran out from her corner but
she slipped on the edge of a thick
rug and fell and in that instant he
had her over her his great twining
arms went reaching and pulling here
patting there while his head now
turned toward me showed a face
sickly white like his people but bloat-
ed beyond all resemblance to a human
being in it was the tide of lust un-
leashed from the bonds of thirty cen-
turies

  i tarried no longer remembering
azors directions now as through a
bloody film i ran to the left finding
there a door going into the great
corridor which in turn led to kreg-
gor s apartments it was dimly light-
ed now and-thank god-quite de-
serted to the right was another
door through which i raced head-
long  then another flight of steps and
now another door this must be the
one leading to her chamber would
it be locked from the inside yes
but not from the outside if it were
like that which led to my own

  i seized the glass knob and gave a
mighty pull it swung open showing
me the room in its entirety luckily
kreggor was at that moment so en-
grossed with his prey that he had no

eye to danger in three leaps i was
across the room constance saw me
coming and stifled a scream he
must have seen it in her eyes how-
ever for he dropped her suddenly
and whirled about his quickness
was astonishing for one of his bulk
i saw his arm go to his tunic if it
reached there and came forth with his
weapon i should be lost for he could
kill me easily as azor had warned
but already the force of my last
bound had hurled me against him
seeing that he was too late his hand
abandoned its quest with his tunic
and shooting upward wrapped its
long springlike fingers about my
throat he saw my dagger then as
it glistened at his breast and with a
hoarse cry of consternation tried to
ward off the blow but i had sunk
it home in his shoulder too high to
be mortal as a knife-thrust yet sure
to kill him because of the venom-em-
bedded point

  he grasped me then about the
waist and with a second hoarse cry
which was almost a scream hurled
my body upward with his giants
strength doubtless he had intended
dashing out my brains against the
wall helpless in that iron grasp i
held up my forearm in a hopeless at-
tempt to ward off the blow but he
was too late the poison had done its
work groaning and frothing white
at the mouth he sank to the floor
while i snatched away from his weak-
ening grasp for a moment he
writhed there emitting scream after
scream until the chamber rang and
rang again and then with a last
convulsion which made the great
muscles in his arms stand out like
whipcords he lay still

  constance stood there her lovely
hair disheveled her uncomprehend-
ing eyes riveted in stupefaction on
the monster at her feet

  quick i exclaimed where is
your father we have not a moment
to lose


weird

tales

  in the next chamber she cried
drawing herself together i know
the way and the door opens from the
outside

together we stumbled out of the
room the hall was still dim
but from somewhere deep in the dis-
tant corridors we heard shouts of
alarm and the running of feet sud-
denly the great lamps above our
heads burst into light leaving not a
shadow in which to hide part-way
down the corridor there was another
door which i seized and threw open
just beyond the threshold fully as
pale as those bloodless atlanteans
was professor lorne

 follow us i shouted they
are coming already

  in the dim distance of the corridor
i saw figures moving toward us then
another set of lights above our heads
leaped into life and we stood revealed
to the entire hall there was surely
no escape in that direction we
were trapped in the tower

  and then i remembered that great
ghostly plant which stood out beside
the rotunda here was the road i
had come-would it not bear us away
as well could i not hack footholds
in the stem of the tiling thus provid-
ing us with a crude ladder to the
earth 

  motioning them to follow me i
rushed out upon the rotunda the
great white stalk stood there as i had
left it a few minutes before its club-
head only a few feet above the para-
pet where growth had ceased the
stem was more than i could reach
around with both arms but i threw
myself about it and with my dagger
began cutting a series of footholds
and handholds in the woody pulp

  follow me down i directed

  it was a test of courage for any
man let alone a woman we were
high in the air a fall at that height
would mean almost certain death for
the foliage which spread between us

and the ground soft as it was could
hardly be expected to break the fall
of a hurtling body and yet with-
out a moments hesitation constance
lome reached out her hands fitted
her feet into the holes and began to
descend the professor came just
behind her

  by this time lights were gleaming
here and there about the palace
there was an increasing chorus of
shouts the ringing of a great bell and
then running of feet in a moment
kreggors henchmen would be in the
tower there with the body of their
master to tell the tale it would not
be long before they scattered to find
us it could be but a few minutes at
most before some one of them would
spy us and we were helpless to de-
fend ourselves any object tossed
from the parapet above would brush
us like so many flies from the stalk of
our friendly plant

  but still they did not come doubt-
less believing we had hidden our-
selves behind some of the corridor
hangings above minutes passed
while the din behind the palace walls
increased and more windows leaped
into life sending long pencils of light
into the gloom of the gardens below

  i was beginning to breathe easier
i had cut my way down to the higher
of the tree limbs through which i
had bored my way on the upward
journey then a strange thing hap-
pened presumably the weight and
motion of our bodies on the stalk of
the toadstool had shaken the ripening
spores loose from their place under
the head and now they were falling
like fine rain to the ground below
five minutes later just as i was
helping constance to climb to a point
where she could share my perch on
the tree limb two great grayish
heads thrust their way through the
foliage in a moment they were pop-
ping up all about us some of them
seemed almost alive in the uncanny
way they nosed about pushing us
the city of glass



hither and yon until i feared we
should be shaken to the ground
these of course would develop spores
in their turn and in a very short
time the whole palace grounds would
be a forest of these great stalks with
that new hope arose in my breast
perhaps in the ensuing confusion we
could conceal ourselves until some
other means of escape offered itself

  presently however as we crouched
there i heard a shout above our
heads and glancing up i saw a row
of grotesque faces peering over the
parapet they had seen us an-
other shout and the faces disap-
peared i seized constance by the
hand and bade her follow me along
the tree limb our hiding place had
been discovered but perhaps we had
yet time to reach the ground and be
off

  after an eternity as it seemed to
me of wild scrambling we reached
the trunk of the tree and i swung
constance down followed by the pro-
fessor here the moss and creepers
aided us and i began to have hopes
we should yet reach the ground un-
seen trembling with expectation i
reached the last limb below us lay
the ground too far to jump and yet
within reach if we aided ourselves by
these twining creepers i seized one
had thrown my leg about it and was
about to swing off when there came
a shout from the palace windows

  too late several of the terrace
doors opened and in the wink of an
eye they were pouring into the
grounds a moment later and they
had gathered beneath us cutting off
all hope of escape we were cap-
tured 

  why i thought of it at that mo-
ment is more than i shall ever know
perhaps the sight of those huge
growths leaping into life all about us
and the obvious consternation of the
atlanteans at the spread of the toad-
stools brought back the words of
azor the spores in a single bottle

are more dangerous to us than a ton
of dynamite 

  and i had a bottle there in my
tunic mixed fungi he had called
them not all toadstools apparent-
ly snatching the bottle out i pulled
off the eap and hurled the contents
out upon the moist air

tor a moment the men below did
not seem to grasp the significance
of my action some of them even
started to pull themselves into the
tree bent on our capture while
others turned their attention to the
toadstools but they were quick to
realize what had happened for pres-
ently there came a cry of surprize
followed by a shriek of alarm

  in a second all was bedlam and
struggle below us i had seen the
swiftly pushing and apparently
harmless toadstools but here there
was something different-horribly
different like jason i had sown the
dragons teeth and a thousand yes a
million warriors were springing full-
panoplied from the earth great
whitish monsters seemed literally to
leap into the air about us in the
flash of an eye those hideous growths
had fastened themselves upon the
bodies of the atlanteans wrapping
their million tendrils about them
bearing them by sheer weight to
earth where the horrible struggle
continued shielded mercifully from
our eyes by the intervening darkness

  all was confusion about us now
the great fungi puffed up here and
there until the whole grounds seemed
to rise and swell in a yeasty mass to-
ward our tree limb in this mass
dark figures struggled and fought for
life only to disappear one by one as
though dragged from the surface by
unseen hands to smother in the pulpy
mass below there were shrieks
cries and groans several of the
atlanteans at the very edge of the
spreading gray carpet pulled them-
selves loose and started to run away


weird

tales

only to have some great fungus leap-
ing seemingly from nowhere land
upon their shoulders and drag them
down presently the whole grounds
as far as i could see were a seething
swaying mass of gray the spores
must have begun to ripen and fly by
that time for i saw some of the pulpy
mass leap to the rotundas and win-
dows of the palace where it soon
passed within to judge from the pan-
demonium from those trapped behind
the walls

  i began to realize then that these
tilings were actually ripening in the
air soon nothing would be safe-
even we should be attacked i won-
dered then why we had not been at-
tacked already the solution of this
i was shortly to learn for at that
moment some poor wretch at the very
loot of our tree managed to pull him-
self free and had dragged himself
almost to our feet before  realized
what had happened i had not the
heart to kill him or thrust him back
and was debating with myself what
course to take when the problem was
solved without my interference

  one of those spores had apparent-
ly sprouted in his clothing for all at
once a pulpy writhing grayish mat-
ter sprang into being about his neck
never shall i forget the look of hor-
ror in the mans eyes as the slimy
stuff increasing and multiplying
with each second gradually broke his
hold on the creepers about him and
dragged him down to his death he
landed with a heavy thump and van-
ished from view with a last despair-
ing scream

  there were fungi all about us on
the tree limb now yet though it
trailed over my feet and gathered
about my knees i still felt that i had
freedom of movement why did not
it attack us as it attacked the at-
lanteans 

  are we to die the same way i
asked turning to professor lome

  i do not think so he replied
calmly we should have been at-
tacked long before this if we were not
immune  

  immune i exclaimed

 yes immune the atlanteans
fall easy prey to these fungi because
of the decadent nature of their bod-
ies back in our own country it is
comparatively rare to see fungi
form upon any organic matter which
is young and vigorous you see toad-
stools and lichens and other forms of
fungi preying upon old damp or rot-
ting material but rarely on the
young and growing we-even i-
as contrasted with the atlanteans
are young and vigorous our flesh
and organs are sound and healthy
this health and soundness is due to
blood and youth these people have
neither life is preserved in them by
some fluid other than blood their
bodies are like damp sodden tree-
trunks and as such they fall easy
prey to these flying spores 

  then they might be described as
a decaying people   i ventured

  it is not a bad adjective but
come i think we had best be moving
on out of here we are safe for the
moment but if these fungi keep on
spreading we shall soon be engulfed
we could be quickly smothered in the
stuff even though it could not seize
and suck at our bodies as it appears
to be doing with those dying wretch-
es below  

  it was indeed true that this new
danger threatened us obviously
we must be out of here as soon as pos-
sible glancing about me i noticed
that a huge limb growing from the
opposite side of the tree led out over
the parapet of a near-by canal as
yet only small bits of fungus had
formed on the parapets mossy sur-
face though puffs of the stuff were
spreading over the ground on either
side to gain the canal parapet by
means of the tree limb would be the
work of a few minutes
the city of glass



  i ran out on the limb bidding them
follow luekily our combined weight
as we approached the end bent it
downward so that the task of getting
from the tree to the parapet was a
simple one once there the road be-
tween the canal on one side and the
puffing yeasty mass of fungi on the
other lay free and open

    the fungus has not yet come thus
far observed the professor as we
reached the end of the boulevards
leading up into the city but i fear
at its present rate of advance it will
soon overrun the entire area at-
lantis is surely surely doomed the
atlanteans are evidently panic-striek-
en no concerted effort can be made
in such confusion to check these
growths  

we started down the nearest of
the palm-banked avenues one
which to all appearances seemed to
lead toward the outskirts of the city
once across the moat and into the
desert we should be safe back of
us the hideous bedlam from the pal-
ace grew fainter and fainter but now
and then from the houses about us
we heard cries of alarm then for
the first time since we had left the
castle grounds we saw a group of
atlanteans turn out of a side street
and run down the avenue ahead of
us they too were bent for the
bridges and the desert

  and then while we looked on a
horrible thing happened the air
about us must have been filled with
these invisible flying spores for sud-
denly on the shoulders and about the
legs of the flying group ahead there
sprang into being great puffs of gray-
ish-white fungi in less than ten sec-
onds eaeli of the helpless wretches
was rolling about the roadway
screaming and tearing with frantic
fingers at this terrible enemy even
before we had reached them they
were entirely enveloped and their
struggles had all but ceased

  just as i feared  gasped the pro-
fessor the air of atlantis is now
alive with spores and these hapless
wretches will carry the fungi to every
part of the city the very bridges
are likely to be packed high with the
stuff before we can reach them cut-
ting off all escape by that means  

  by this time the eery light of com-
ing dawn had suffused the street
here and there we saw some strug-
gling gray mass beside the roadway
but we knew now too well what it was
to give it more than a passing glance
these grew thicker and thicker as we
went on but here most of them lay
still which meant they had been at-
tacked on their rush for the city
bridges long before that explained
perhaps why we had seen so few of
the atlanteans running in the streets
doubtless most of them at the start
of the outbreak had made a dash for
the bridges only to be dragged down
long before they reached them

  presently the professor bade us
stop it is no use to go farther in
this direction said he see that
is undoubtedly a bridge in the dis-
tance but these people have been
caught there and now there is no
way for us to get through that seeth-
ing mass we should only be smoth-
ered  

  it was true gazing ahead in the
gray light of dawn i saw a huge
trembling wall ahead of us higher
than the surrounding houses it was
the fungus feeding on the atlan-
teans who had sought escape at the
bridges to try to push our way
through that seething writhing mass
would mean a terrible death by suffo-
cation

  no doubt every bridge leading
from the city is in the same condi-
tion said professor lorne per-
haps we might be able to swim the
moat at some spot between

  impossible said i the moat
is alive with crocodiles these at-


weird tales

lanteans have surely signed their own
death warrant  

   and then i told them further what
had happened to penfield i had
whispered to constance before how
penfield had perished and from time
to time i had seen tears in her eyes
but now with a moments breathing
space she began to cry

  the professor touched his head
significantly when i had told him
more in detail   penfield had insan-
ity in his family he whispered to
me as we were hurrying back along
the way wre had come

  and so in this manner colin pen-
field passed out of our lives forever

   by this time the streets were clearly
 outlined in the first golden flush of
 dawn there were no longer any liv-
 ing atlanteans to be seen and the
 fungus as if still unsatiated had be-
 gun to spread into the trees and
 shrubbery which lined the avenues
 these already covered from trunk to
 leaf wrere like giant puff-balls raised
 against the sky tendrils of the
 stuff began to make their way across
 the streets and these coiling about
 our feet made walking extremely
 difficult surely something must be
 done erelong or we should be trapped
 in some corner and overcome

  but what could we do every
avenue was now a seething mass of
gray every bridge leading out of
atlantis would surely be blocked
the moat was out of the question a
matter of a few hours and wte too
would be face to face with death in-
deed we were that already

the morning sun rose blood-red
over the housetops revealing
new horrors with every blazing shaft
the city of glass had now become one
vast silent sepulcher wrherein the
only thing that lived aside from us
was death itself

  despair had seized upon my own
heart when suddenly there loomed
over the housetops before us a gar-

gantuan three-legged structure sup-
porting a huge hemisphere of glass
it was the atlantean sun-glass which
azor had pointed out to me from the
terraces of the palace

  professor lorne grasped the possi-
bility quicker than i

 by jove he cried suddenly
the sun-glass we have the means
here of burning our wtay out of this
accursed city  

  he began to run once more and
we after him shortly wre found our-
selves in a large open square with
the great glistening crystal over our
heads there was a small steel cu-
pola just below and to the right of
the glass this obviously was the
structure which housed the apparatus
for directing the ray another few
seconds and wre had swarmed up a
narrow steel ladder finding ourselves
in a small steel box with a maze of
wheels and levers on the wall the
professor seized upon these and be-
gan twisting them this way and that
his eyes glued to a large mirror be-
fore him which as i could now see
reflected the movements of the great
lens above if the source of electrical
power stored for night use was still
intact we should have no difficulty
in shifting the brilliant beam of light
which now rested on the base of the
steel boilers across the square

  the lens was moving power was
still intact manipulating the levers
for several minutes the professor
worked out their meaning pointing
out in excited tones meanwhile that
the apparatus did not differ so great-
ly from that of the great telescope
with which he was familiar at the
university now he shot the great
beam for the first time into the
massed fungi in the streets below us
for a moment there was dead silence
and i thought the cursed growths
must be immune from heat present-
ly however there came a slight hiss-

to your kennel
hound of hell i jules
de grandin command
it

  llo jules de grandin
seized the receiver from
 jl the office telephone before
the echo of the tinkling bell had
ceased who is it please but of
course mademoiselle you may speak
with dr trowbridge  he passed
the instrument to me and busied him-
self with a third unsuccessful attempt
to ignite the evil-smelling french
cigarette with which he insisted on
fumigating the room

  yes i queried placing the re-
ceiver to my ear

  this is miss ostrander dr trow-
bridge a well modulated voice in-
formed me mrs evanders nurse
you know

  yes i repeated a little sharp-
ly annoyed at being called by an
ordinary case after an onerous day
what is it

  i-i dont quite know sir she
laughed the short semi-hysterical
laugh of an embarrassed woman
shes acting very queerly she-
shes-oh my there it goes again

sir please come over right away
im afraid shes becoming delirious  
and with that she hung up leaving
me in a state of astounded impa-
tience

    confound the woman  i scolded
as i prepared to slip into my over-
coat why couldnt she have hung
on thirty seconds more and told me
what the matter was

  eh what is it my friend de
grandin gave up his attempt to make
the cigarette burn and regarded me
with one of his fixed unwinking
stares you are puzzled you are
in trouble can i assist you

  perhaps i replied theres a
patient of mine a mrs evander
whos been suffering from a threat-
ened leukemia-ive administered
fowlers solution and arsenic trioxid
and given her bed-rest treatment for
the past week it looked as if we
had the situation pretty well in hand
but- i repeated miss ostran-
ders message

                                  


weird tales

 ah he murmured musingly
 there it goes again she did say
what i wonder was it a cough
a convulsion or-who can say let
us hasten my friend parbleu she
does intrigue me that mademoiselle
ostrander with her so cryptic  there
it goes again

lights were gleaming through the
storm from the windows of the
evander house as we came to a stop
before its wide veranda a colored
servant half clothed and badly
frightened let us in and ushered us
on tiptoe to the upper story chamber
where the mistress of the establish-
ment lay sick

  whats wrong i demanded as
i entered the sickroom de grandin
at my heels

  a glance at the patient reassured
me she lay back on a little pile of
infant pillows her pretty blond hair
trickling in stray rivulets of gold
from the confines of her lace sleeping
cap her hands almost as white as
the linen itself spread restfully on
the madeira counterpane

 humph i exclaimed turning
angrily to miss ostrander is this
what you called me out in the rain
to see

  the nurse raised a forefinger
quickly to her lips and motioned to-
ward the hall with her eyes doc-
tor she said in a whisper when we
stood outside the sickroom door i
know youll think me silly but-but
it was positively ghastly  

  tiens mademoiselle de gran-
din eut in i pray you be more ex-
plicit first you tell friend trow-
bridge that something-we know not
what-goes again now you do inform
us that something is ghastly pardieu
you have my sheep-non non how
do you say-my goat

  in spite of herself the girl laughed
at the tragic face he turned to her
but she recovered her gravity quickly

  last night she went on still in
a whisper and the night before
just at  a dog howled somewhere
in the neighborhood i couldnt place
the sound but it was one of those
long quavering howls almost human
positively you might have mistaken
it for the cry of a little child in pain
at first

  de grandin tweaked first one then
the other end of his trimly waxed
blond mustache and it was the
sleepless dogs lament which went
again and which was so ghastly
mademoiselle he inquired solicit-
ously

  no the nurse exploded with
suppressed vehemence and height-
ened color it was mrs evander
sir night before last when the beast
began baying she stirred in her sleep
-turned restlessly for a moment
then went back to sleep when it
howled the second time a little near-
er the house she half sat up and
made a queer little growling noise in
her throat then she slept last
night the animal was howling louder
and longer and mrs evander seemed
more restless and made odd noises
more distinctly i thought the dog
was annoying her or that she might
be having a nightmare so i got her
a drink of water but when i tried
to give it to her she snarled at me
eh bien but this is of interest
de grandin commented she did
snarl at you you say

  yes sir she didnt wake up
when i touched her on the shoulder
just turned her head toward me and
showed her teeth and growled
growled like a bad-tempered dog
yes and then

    tonight the dog began howling a
few minutes earlier five or ten min-
utes before midnight perhaps and it
seemed to me his voice was much
stronger mrs evander had the
same reaction she had the other two
nights at first but suddenly she sat
bolt-upright in bed rolled her head
the blood-flower



from side to side and drew back her
lips and growled then she began
snapping at the air like a dog an-
noyed by a fly i did my best to
quiet her but i didnt like to go too
near-i was afraid really-and all
at once the dog began howling again
right in the next yard it seemed and
mrs evander threw back her bed-
clothes knelt up in bed and answered
him

  answered him i echoed in

stupefaction

  yes doctor she threw back her
head and howled-long quavering
howls just like his at first they
were low but they grew louder and
higher till the servants heard them
and james the butler came to the
door to see what the matter was
poor fellow he was nearly scared out
of his wits when he saw her

  and then- i began

  then i called you right while
i was talking to you the dog began
baying again and mrs evander an-
swered him that was what i meant

-	she turned to de grandin-when
i said there it goes again i had
to hang up before i could explain to
you dr trowbridge for she had
started to crawl out of bed toward
the window and i had to run and
stop her

  but why didnt you tell me this
yesterday or this afternoon when i
was here i demanded

  i didnt like to sir she defend-
ed   it all seemed so crazy so utter-
ly impossible especially in the day-
time that i was afraid youd think
id been asleep on duty and dreamed
it all but now that james has seen
it too-

  outside in the rain-drenched night
there suddenly rose a wail long-
drawn pulsating doleful as the cry
of an abandoned soul o-o-o-o-o-o-o
-o-o-o-o-o-o-o it rose and fell
quavered and almost died away then
resurged with increased force o-o-o
-o-o-oio-o-o-o-o-o-o-o   

  hear it the nurse cried her
voice thin-edged with excitement and
fear

  again o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-
o-o-o-o like the echo of the howls
outside came an answering cry from
the sickroom beyond the door

  miss ostrander dashed into the
room de grandin and i close behind
her

  the dainty white counterpane had
been thrown back mrs evander
clad only in her georgette nightrobe
and bed-eap had crossed the floor to
the window and flung up the sash
already the wind-whipped rain was
beating in upon her as she leaned
across the sill one pink sole toward
us one little white foot on the win-
dow-ledge preparatory to jumping

  mon dieu seize her de gran-
din shrieked and matching command
with performance leaped across the
room grasped her shoulders in his
small strong hands and bore her
backward as she flexed the muscles of
her legs to hurl herself into the yard
below

  for a moment she fought like a
tigress snarling scratching even
snapping at us with her teeth but
miss ostrander and i overbore her
and thrust her into bed drawing the
covers over her and holding them
dowm like a strait-jacket against her
furious struggles

  de grandin leaned across the win-
dow-sill peering out into the stormy
darkness  aroint thee accursed of
god i heard him shout into the
wind as he drew the sash down
snapped the catch fast and turned
again to the room

  ah he approached the strug-
gling patient and bent over her star-
ing intently a grain and a half
of morphine in her arm if you please
friend trowbridge the dose is
heavy for a non-addiet but-he
shrugged his shoulders-it is neces-
saire that she sleep this poor one so
that is better


weird tales

  mademoiselle he regarded miss
ostrander with his wide-eyed stare
i do not think she will be thus dis-
turbed in the day but i most strong-
ly urge that hereafter you administer
a dose of one-half grain of codein dis-
solved in eighty parts of water each
night not later than half-past 
dr trowbridge will write the pre-
scription

  friend trowbridge he inter-
rupted himself where if at all is
madames husband monsieur evan-
der

  hes gone to atlanta on a busi-
ness trip miss ostrander supplied
we expect him back tomorrow

    tomorrow  zut that is too bad  
de grandin exclaimed eh bien
with you americans it is always the
business business before pleasure
business before happiness cordieu
business before the safety of those
you love

  mademoiselle you will please
keep in touch with dr trowbridge
and me at all times and when that
monsieur evander does return from
his business trip please tell him that
we desire to see him soon-at once
right away immediately

    come friend trowbridge-bonne
nuit mademoiselle

t say dr trowbridge niles

  a evander flung angrily into my
consulting room whats the idea of
keeping my wife doped like this
here i just got back from a trip to
the south last night and rushed out
to the house to see her before she
went to sleep and that dam nurse
said shed given her a sleepin pow-
der and couldnt waken her i dont
like it i tell you and i wont have
it i told the nurse that if she gave
her any dope tonight she was
through and that goes for you too
he glared defiantly at me

  de grandin sunk in the depths of
a great chair with a copy of de gobin-
eaus melancholy lovers of kanda-

har glanced up sharply then con-
sulted the watch strapped to his
wrist it is a quarter of  he
announced apropos of nothing laying
down the elegant blue-and-gold
volume and rising from his seat

  evander turned on him eyes
ablaze youre dr de grandin
he accused ive heard of you
from the nurse it was you per-
suaded trowbridge to dope my wife
-buttin in on a case that didnt
concern you i know all about you  
he went on furiously as the french-
man gave him a cold stare youre
some sort of charlatan from paris a
dabbler in criminology and spiritual-
ism and that sort of rot well sir i
want to warn you to keep your hands
off my wife american doctors and
american methods are good enough
for me 

  your patriotism is most admir-
able monsieur de grandin mur-
mured with a suspicious mildness

if you-

  the jangle of the telephone bell
cut through his words yes he
asked sharply raising the receiver
but keeping his cold eyes fixed on
evanders face yes mademoiselle
ostrander this is-grand dieu
what how long eh do you say
so dix million diables but of
course we come we hasten-mor-
bleu but we shall fly

  gentlemen he hung up the re-
ceiver then turned to us inclining
his shoulders ceremoniously to each ot
us in turn his gaze as expressionless
as the eyes of a graven image that
was mademoiselle ostrander on the
phone madame evander is gone-
disappeared  

    gone  disappeared    evander
echoed stupidly looking helplessly
from de grandin to me and back
again he slumped down in the
nearest chair gazing straight before
him unseeingly great god he
murmured
the blood-flower



  precisely monsieur de grandin
agreed in an even emotionless voice
that is exactly what i said mean-
time  -he gave me a significant
glance-let us go cher trowbridge
i doubt not that mademoiselle os-
trander will have much of interest to
relate

  monsieur-his eyes and voice
again became cold hard stonily ex-
pressionless-if you can so far dis-
commode yourself as to travel in the
company of one whose nationality
and methods you disapprove i sug-
gest you accompany us  

  niles evander rose like a sleep-
walker and followed us to my wait-
ing car

nphe previous days rain had
-i turned to snow with a shifting
of the wind to the northeast and we
made slow progress through the sub-
urban roads it was nearly midnight
when we trooped up the steps to the
evander porch and pushed vigorous-
ly at the bell-button

  yes sir miss ostrander re-
plied to my question mr evander
came home last night and positively
forbade my giving mrs evander any
more codein i told him you wanted
to see him right away and that dr
de grandin had ordered the narcotic
but he said-

  forbear if you please mademoi-
selle de grandin interrupted
monsieur evander has already been
at pains to say as much-and more-
to us in person now when did
madame disappear if you please

  id already given her her medi-
cine last night the nurse took up
her story at the point of interrup-
tion so there was no need of calling
you to tell you of mr evanders or-
ders i thought perhaps i could
avoid any unpleasantness by pretend-
ing to obey him and giving her the
codein on the sly this evening but
about  oclock he came into the sick-
room and snatched up the box of

powders and put them in his pocket
then he said he was going to drive
over to have it out with you i tried
to telephone you about it but the
storm had put the wires out of com-
mission and ive been trying to get
a message through ever since  

  and the dog mademoiselle the
animal who did howl outside the win-
dow has he been active

   yes last night he screamed and
howled so i was frightened posi-
tively it seemed as though he were
trying to jump up from the ground
to the window mrs evander slept
through it all though thanks to the
drug  

    and tonight   de grandin
prompted

 tonight the nurse shud-
dered the howling began about
half-past  just a few minutes after
mr evander left for the city mrs
evander was terrible she seemed
like a woman possessed i fought
and struggled with her but nothing
i could do had the slightest effect
she was savage as a maniac i called
james to help me hold her in bed
once and then for a while she lay
quietly for the thing outside seemed
to have left

  some time later the howling be-
gan again louder and more furious
and mrs evander was twice as hard
to manage she fought and bit so
that i was beginning to lose control
of her and i screamed for james
again he must have been some-
were down-stairs though for he
didnt hear my call i ran out into
the hall and leaned over the balus-
trade to call again and when i ran
back-i wasnt out there more than a
minute-the window was up and mrs
evander was gone

  and didnt you do anything-
didnt you look for her evander
cut in passionately

  yes sir james and i ran outside
and called and searched all through
the grounds but we couldnt find a


weird tales

trace of her the wind is blowing so
and the snow falling so rapidly any
tracks she might have made would
have been wiped out almost immedi-
ately  

  de grandin took his little pointed
chin between the thumb and fore-
finger of his right hand and bowed
his head in silent meditation   horns
of the devil i heard him mutter
to himself  this is queer-those
cries that delirium that attempted
flight now this disappearance par-
dicu the trail seems clear but why
mille cochons why

  	 see here   evander broke in
frantically cant you do some-
thing call the police call the

neighbors call-

  monsieur de grandin inter-
rupted in a frigid voice may i in-
quire your vocation

  eh evander was taken aback
why-er-im an engineer
precisely exactly dr trow-
bridge and i are medical men we
do not attempt to build bridges or
sink tunnels we should make sorry
work of it you monsieur have al-
ready once tried your hand at medi-
cine by forbidding the administra-
tion of a drug we considered neces-
sary your results were most de-
plorable kindly permit us to fol-
low our profession in our own way
the thing we most of all do not de-
sire in this case is the police force
later perhaps now it would be
more than ruinous

 but-

  there are no buts monsieur it
is my belief that your wife madame
evander is in no immediate danger
however dr trowbridge and i shall
institute such search as may be prac-
ticable and do you meantime keep in
such communication with us as the
storm will permit he bowed
formally a very good night to
you monsieur

  miss ostrander looked at him ques-

tioningly shall i go with you

doctor she asked

  mais non he replied  you
will please remain here ma nourrice
and attend the homecoming of ma-
dame evander  

then you think she will return
most doubtlessly unless i am
more badly mistaken than i think i
am she will be back to you before
another day

  say evander almost beside
himself burst out what makes you
so cock-sure shell be back good
lord man do you realize shes out in
this howling blizzard with only her
night-clothes on

  perfectly but i do declare she
will return

but youve nothing to base your

absurd-

  monsieur de grandins sharp
whiplike reply cut in me i am
jules de grandin when i say she
will return i mean she will return
i do not make mistakes

xhere shall we begin the
  search   i asked as we en-
tered my car

  he settled himself snugly in the
cushions and lighted a cigarette we
need not search clier ami he re-
plied she will return of her own
free will and accord

  but man i argued evander
was right shes out in this storm
with nothing but a georgette night-
dress on

  i doubt it   he answered casually

  	 you doubt it  why-  

  unless the almost unmistakable
signs fail my friend this madame
evander thanks to her husbands
pig-ignorance is this moment clothed
in fur

  fur i echoed

  perfectly come my friend
tread upon the gas let us snatch
what sleep we can tonight tomor-
row-eh bien tomorrow is anothe
day
the blood-flower



tte was up and waiting for me as
i entered the office next morning
tell me friend trowbridge he
demanded this madame evanders
leukemia upon what did you base
your diagnosis

  well i replied referring to my
clinical cards a physical examina-
tion showed the axillary glands
slightly enlarged the red corpuscles
reduced to little more than a million
to the count the white cells stood at
about four hundred thousand and
the patient complained of weakness
drowsiness and a general feeling of
malaise

  um he commented non-com-
mittally that could easily be so
yes such signs would undoubtlessly

be shown now- the telephone

bell broke off his remarks half ut-
tered

  ah his little blue eyes snapped
triumphantly as he listened to the
voice on the wire i did think so
but yes right away at once imme-
diately

  trowbridge my old one she has
returned that was mademoiselle
ostrander informing me of madame
evanders reappearance let us
hasten there is much i would do
this day

 a fter you went last night miss
ostrander told us i lay down
on the chaise longue in the bedroom
and tried to sleep i suppose i must
have napped by fits and starts but it
seemed to me i could hear the faint
howling of dogs sometimes mingled
with yelps and cries all through the
night this morning just after 
oclock i got up to prepare myself a
piece of toast and a cup of tea before
the servants were stirring and as i
came down-stairs i found mrs evan-
der lying on the rug in the front
hall

  she paused a moment and her
color mounted slightly as she went
on she was lying on that gray

wolfskin rug before the fireplace
sir and was quite nude her sleep-
ing cap and nightgown were crum-
pled up on the floor beside her   
all de grandin commented

and-

  i got her to her feet and helped
her up-stairs where i dressed her for
bed and tucked her in she didnt
seem to show any evil effects from be-
ing out in the storm indeed she
seems much better this morning and
is sleeping so soundly i could hardly
wake her for breakfast and when i
did she wouldnt eat just went
back to sleep

  ah de grandin repeated
and you bathed her mademoiselle
before she was put to bed   

  the girl looked slightly startled
no sir not entirely but i did wash
her hands they were discolored
especially about the fingertips with
some red substance almost as if she
had been scratching something and
gotten blood under her nails
parbuu the frenchman ex-
ploded i did know it friend
trowbridge jules de grandin he
is never mistaken

  mademoisellehe turned fever-
ishly to the nurse did you by any
happy chance save the water in
which you laved madame evander s
hands  

  why no i didnt but-oh i see
-yes i think perhaps some of the
stain may be on the washcloth and
the orange stick i cleaned her nails
with i really had quite a time clean-
ing them too

  bien tres bien he ejaculated
let us have these cloths these
sticks at once please trowbridge
do you withdraw some blood from
madames arm for a test then we
must hasten to the laboratory cor-
dieu i burn with impatience

  an hour later we faced each other
in the office i cant understand
it i confessed by all the canons
of the profession mrs evander


weird tales

ought to be dead after last nights
experience but theres no doubt
shes better her pulse was firmer
her temperature right and her blood
count practically normal today

  me i understand perfectly up
to a point he replied beyond
that all is dark as the cave of erebus
behold i have tested the stains from
madames fingers they are-what
do you think

  blood i hazarded

  parbleu yes but not of human-
ity mais non they are blood of a
dog my friend

  of a dog

  perfectly i myself did greatly
fear they might prove human but
grace a dien they are not now if
you will excuse i go to make certain
investigations and will meet you at
the maison evander this evening
come prepared to be surprized my
friend pardieu i shall be surprized
if i do not astonish myself  

tjour of us de grandin miss os-
trander niles evander and i sat
in the dimly lighted room looking
alternately toward the bed where the
mistress of the house lay in a drugged
sleep into the still-burning fire of
coals in the fireplace grate and at
each others faces three of us were
puzzled almost to the point of hys-
teria and de grandin seemed on
pins and needles with excitement and
expectation occasionally he would
rise and walk to the bed with that
quick soundless tread of his which
always made me think of a cat again
he would dart into the hall nervous-
ly light a cigarette draw a few quick
puffs from it then glide noiselessly
into the sickroom once more none
of us spoke above a whisper and our
conversation was limited to incon-
sequential things throughout our
group there was the tense expectancy
and solemn taut-nerved air of medi-
cal witnesses in the prison death

chamber awaiting the advent of the
condemned

  subconsciously i think we all real-
ized what we waited for but my
nerves nearly snapped when it came

  with the suddenness of a shot un-
heralded by any preliminary the
wild vibrating howl of a beast sound-
ed beneath the sickroom window its
sharp poignant wail seeming to split
the frigid moonlit air of the night
o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o it
rose against the winter stillness
diminished to a moan of heart-rend-
ing melancholy then suddenly
crescendoed upward from a moan to
a wail from a wail to a howl de-
spairing passionate longing as the
lament of a damned spirit wild and
fierce as the rallying call of the fiends
of heh

  oh miss ostrander exclaimed
involuntarily

  let be jules de grandin or-
dered tensely his whisper seeming
to carry more because of its sharpness
than from any actual sound it made

    o-o-o-o-o-o-o - o-o-o-o-o-o-o   
again the cry shuddered through the
air again it rose to a pitch of intol-
erable shrillness and evil then died
away and as we sat stone-still in the
shadowy chamber a new sound a
sinister scraping sound intensified
by the ice-hard coldness of the night
came to us someone some thing
was swarming up the rose-trellis out-
side the house

  scrape scratch scrape the alter-
nate hand- and foot-holds sounded on
the cross-bars of the lattice a pair
of hands long slender corded hands
like the hands of a cadaver long dead
and armed with talons blood-stained
and hooked grasped the window-
ledge and a face-god of mercy
such a face-was silhouetted against
the background of the night

  not human nor yet wholly bestial
it was but partook grotesquely of
both so that it was at once a foul
caricature of each the forehead was
the blood-flower



low and narrow and sloped back to
a thatch of short nondescript-colored
hair resembling an animals fur the
nose was elongated out of all
semblance to a human feature and
resembled the pointed snout of some
animal of the canine tribe except that
it curved sharply downward at the
tip like the beak of some unclean bird
of prey thin cruel lips were drawn
sneeringly back from a double row of
tusklike teeth which gleamed horrid-
ly in the dim reflection of the open
fire and a pair of round baleful eyes
green as the luminance from a rot-
ting carcass in a midnight swamp
glared at us across the window-sill
on eaeh of us in turn the basilisk
glance dwelt momentarily then
fastened itself on the sleeping sick
woman like a falcons talons on a
dove

  miss ostrander gave a single chok-
ing sob and slid forward from her
chair unconscious evander and i
sat stupefied with horror unable to
do more than gaze in terror-stricken
silence at the apparition but jules de
grandin was out of his seat and
across the room with a single bound
of feline grace and ferocity

  aroint thee accursed of god
he screamed showering a barrage of
blows from a slender wand on the
creatures face back spawn of
satan to thy kennel hound of
hell i jules de grandin command
it

  the suddenness of his attack took
the thing by surprize for a mo-
ment it snarled and cowered under
the hailstorm of blows from de gran-
din s stick then as suddenly as it
had come into view it loosed its hold
on the window-sill and dropped from
sight

  sang de dieu sang du diable
sang des tous les saints de ciel de
grandin roared hurling himself out
the window in the wake of the fleeing
monster i have you vile wretch

pardieu monsieur loup-garou but i
shall surely crush you  

  rushing to the window i saw the
tall skeleton-thin form of the enorm-
ity leaping across the moonlit snow
with great space-devouring bounds
and after it brandishing his wand
ran jules de grandin shouting tri-
umphant invectives in mingled
french and english

  by the shadow of a copse of ever-
greens the thing made a stand
wheeling in its tracks it bent nearly
double extending its cadaverous
claws like a wrestler searching for a
hold and baring its glistening tusks
in a snarl of fury

  de grandin never slackened pace
charging full-tilt upon the waiting
monstrosity he reached his free hand
into his jacket pocket there was a
gleam of blue metal in the moonlight
then eight quick pitiless spurts of
flame stabbed through the shadow
where the monster lurked eight whip-
like crackling reports echoed and re-
echoed in the midnight stillness-
and the voice of jules de grandin

    trowbridge mon vieux ohe
friend trowbridge bring a light
quickly i would that you see what
i see

  weltering in a patch of blood-
stained snow at de grandins feet we
found an elderly man ruddy-faced
gray-haired and doubtless in life
of a dignified even benign aspect
now however he lay in the snow as
naked as the day his mother first
saw him and eight gaping gunshot
wounds told where de grandins mis-
siles had found their mark the
winter cold was already stiffening his
limbs and setting his facc in a mask
of death

  good heavens evander ejacu-
lated as he bent over the lifeless
form its uncle friedrich-my
wifes uncle he disappeared just
before i went south

  eh bien de grandin regarded
the body with no more emotion than


weird tales

if it had been an effigy molded in
snow we shall know where to find
your uncle henceforth monsieur
will some of you pick him up me-
pardieu-i would  more touch him
than i would handle a hyena

xtow monsieur de grandin
  faced evander across the liv-
ing room table your statement that
the gentleman at whose happy dis-
patch i so fortunately officiated was
your wifes uncle and that he dis-
appeared before your southern trip
does interest me say on tell me all
concerning this uncle friedrich of
your wifes when did he disappear
and what led up to his disappear-
ance  omit nothing i pray you for
trifles which you may consider of no
account may be of the greatest im-
portance proceed monsieur i
listen

  evander squirmed uncomfortably
in his chair like a small boy undergo-
ing catechism he wasnt really
her uncle he responded her
father and he were schoolmates in
germany - heidelberg - years ago
mr hoffmeister-uncle friedrich-
immigrated to this country shortly
after my father-in-law came back
and they were in business together
for years mr hoffmeister lived
with my wifes people-all the chil-
dren called him uncle friedrich-
and was just like one of the family

 my mother-in-law died a few
years ago and her husband died
shortly after and mr hoffmeister
disposed of his share of the business
and went to germany on a long
visit he was caught there in the
war and didnt return to america
until  since that time he lived
with us

 evander paused a moment as
though debating mentally whether
he should proceed then smiled in a
half shamefaced manner to tell
you the truth he continued i

wasnt very keen on having him
here there were times when i
didnt like the way he looked at my
wife a dam bit

  eh de grandin asked how
was that monsieur 

  well i cant quite put a handle
to it in words but more than once
id glance up and see him with his
eyes fastened on edith in a most
peculiar way it would have an-
gered me in a young man but in an
old man it both angered and dis-
gusted me i was on the point of
asking him to leave when he disap-
peared and saved me the trouble

  yes de grandin encouraged
and his disappearance what of
that

  the old fellow was always an
enthusiastic amateur botanist
evander replied and he brought a
great many specimens for his herba-
rium back from europe with him
off and on hes been messing around
with plants since his return and
about a month ago he received a tin
of dried flowers from kerovitch ru-
mania and they seemed to set him
almost wild

  kerovitch mordieu de gran-
din exclaimed say on monsieur
i burn with curiosity describe
these flowers in detail if you
please

  hm evander took his chin in
his hand and studied in silence a
moment there wasnt anything
especially remarkable about them
that i could see there were a doz-
en of them all told perhaps and
they resembled our ox-eyed daisies
a good deal except that their petals
were red instead of yellow had a
queer sort of odor too even though
they were dried they exuded a sort
of sickly-sweet smell yet not quite
sweet either it was a sort of mix-
ture of perfume and stench if that
means anything to you

  pardieu it means much de
grandin assured him and their
the blood-flower



sap where it had dried did it not
resemble that of the milkweed
plant

   yes how did you know   

  no matter proceed if you
please your uncle friedrich did
take these so accursed flowers out

and-

  and tried an experiment with
them evander supplied he put
them in a bowl of water and they
freshened up as though they had not
been plucked an hour

  yes-and his disappearance-
name of a little green man-his dis-
appearance

    that happened just before i
went south all three of us went to
the theater one evening and uncle
friedrich wore one of the red
flowers in his buttonhole my wife
wore a spray of them in her cor-
sage he tried to get me to put one
of the things in my coat too but i
hated their smell so much i wouldnt
do it

  lucky you de grandin mur-
mured so low the narrator failed to
hear him

  uncle friedrich was very rest-
less and queer all evening evander
proceeded but the old fellow had
been getting rather childish lately
so we didnt pay any particular at-
tention to his actions next morn-
ing he was gone

  and did you make inquiry
no he often went away on little
trips without warning us before-
hand and besides i was glad
enough to see him get out i didnt
try to find him it was just after
this that my wifes health became
bad but i had to make this trip for
our firm so i called in dr trow-
bridge and there you are

  yes parlleu here we are in-
deed de grandin nodded em-
phatically listen listen careful-
ly my friends what i am about to
say is the truth

  when first i came to visit ma-

dame evander with friend trow-
bridge and heard the strange story
mademoiselle ostrander told i was
amazed why i ask me does this
lady answer the howling of a dog
beneath her window parbleu it
was most curious

  then while we three-friend
trowbridge mademoiselle ostran-
der and i-did talk of madames so
strange malady i did hear the call
of that dog beneath the window
with my own two ears and did ob-
serve madame evanders reaction to
it

  out the window i did put my
head and in the storm i saw no dog
at all but what i thought might be
a human man-a tall thin man yet
a dog had howled beneath that win-
dow and had been answered by ma-
dame but a moment before me i
do not like that

  i call upon that man if such he
be to begone also i do request
mademoiselle ostrander to place her
patient under an opiate each night
that the howls beneath her window
may not awaken madame evander

  eh bien thus far thus good but
you do come along monsieur and
countermand my order while ma-
dame is not under the drug that un-
holy thing beneath her window does
howl once more and madame dis-
appears yes

  now there was no ordinary
medical diagnosis for such a case as
this so i search my memory and my
knowledge for an extraordinary
one what do i find in that store-
house of my mind

  in parts of europe my friends
-believe me i know whereof i
speak-there are known such
things as werewolves or wolf-men
in france we know them as les loups-
garoux in wales they call them the
bug-wolves or bogie-wolves in the
days of old the greeks did know them
under the style of lukanthropos yes


weird tales

  what he is no one knows well
sometimes he is said to be a wolf-a
magical wolf-who can become a
man sometimes more often he is
said to be a man who can or must
become a wolf no one knows accu-
rately but this we know the man
who is also a wolf is ten times more
terrible than the wolf who is only a
wolf at night he quests and kills
his prey which is most often his fel-
low man but sometimes his ancient
enemy the dog by day he hides his
villainy under the guise of a mans
form sometimes he changes entire-
ly to a wolfs shape sometimes he be-
comes a fearful mixture of man and
beast but always he is a devil incar-
nate if he be killed while in the
wolf shape he at once reverts to hu-
man form so by that sign we know
we have slain a werewolf and not a
true wolf certainly

 now some werewolves become
such by the aid of satan some be-
come so as the result of a curse a few
are so through accident in transyl-
vania that devil-ridden land the
very soil does seem to favor the trans-
formation of man into beast there
are springs from which the water
once drunk will make its drinker in-
to a savage beast and there are flow-
ers-cor dim have i not seen them
-which if worn by a man at night
during the full of the moon will do
the same among the most potent of
these blooms of hell is la fleur de
sang or blood-flower which is exact-
ly the accursed weed you have de-
scribed to us monsieur evander-
the flower your uncle friedrich and
your lady did wear to the theater that
night of the full moon when you
mentioned the village of kerovitch
i did see it all at once immediately
for that place is on the rumanian
side of the transylvanian alps and
there the blood-flowers are found in
greater numbers than anywhere else
in the world the very mountain

soil does seem cursed with lycan-
thropy

  very well i did not know of
the flower when first i came into this
case but i did suspect something evil
had east a spell on madame she did
exhibit all the symptoms of a lycan-
thrope about to be transformed and
beneath her window there did howl
what was undoubtedly a wolf-thing

   he has put his cursed sign upon
her and does even now seek her for
his mate  i tell me after i order him
away in the name of the good god

  when madame disappeared i was
not surprized when she returned
after a night in the snow i was less
surprized but the blood on her
hands did perturb me was it hu-
man was she an all-unconscious
murderess or was it happily the
blood of animals i did not know

i	analyzed it and discovered it were
dogs blood very well i tell me
let us see where a dog has been
mauled in that vicinity 

  this afternoon i made guarded
inquiries i find many dogs have
been strangely killed in this neighbor-
hood of late no dog no matter how
big was safe out of doors after night-
fall

  also i meet a man an ivrogne-
what you call a drunkard-one who
patronizes the leggers-of-the-boot not
with wisdom but with too great
frequency he is no more so he
have made the oath to remain sober
pourquoi f because three nights ago
as he passed through the park he
were set upon by a horror so terrible
that he thought he was in alcoholic
delirium it were like a man yet
not like a man it had a long nose
and terrible eyes and great flashing
teeth and it did seek to kill and de-
vour him my friends in his way
that former drunkard did describe
the thin which tried to enter this
house tonight it wrere the same

  fortunately for the poor drunk-
en man he were carrying a walking
the blood-flower



cane of ash wood and when he raised
it to defend himself the terror did
shrink from him ah ha i tell me
when i hear that now we know it
were truly le loup-garou for it is
notorious that the wood of the ash
tree is as intolerable to the werewolf
as the bloom of the garlic is unpleas-
ant to the vampire

   what do i do i go to the woods
and cut a bundle of ash switches
then i come here tonight the wolf-
thing come crying for the mate who
ranged the snows with him last night
he is lonely he is mad for another
of his kind tonight perhaps they
will attack nobler game than dogs
very well i am ready

  when madame evander being
drugged did not answer his call he
was emboldened to enter the house
pardieu he did not know jules de
grandin awaited him had i not
been here it might well have gone
hard with mademoiselle ostrander
as it was-he spread his slender
hands-there is one less man-mon-
ster in the world this night

  evander stared at him in round-
eyed wonder i cant believe it
he muttered but youve proved
your case poor uncle friedrich

the curse of the blood-flower-

he broke off an expression of min-
gled horror and despair on his face
my wife he gasped will she

become a thing like that will-

  monsieur de grandin inter-
rupted gently she has become one
only the drug holds her bound in
human form at this minute

  oh evander cried tears of
grief streaming down his face save
her for the love of heaven save
her cant you do anything to bring
her back to me

  you do not approve my meth-
ods de grandin reminded him

  evander was like a pleading child
i apologize he whimpered ill
give you anything you ask if youll

only save her im not rich but i
think i can raise fifty thousand dol-
lars ill give it to you if youll cure
her

  the frenchman twisted his little
blond mustache furiously the fee
you name is attractive monsieur he
remarked

  ill pay it ill pay it evander
burst out hysterically then unable
to control himself he put his folded
arms on the table sank his head up-
on them and shook with sobs

  very well de grandin agreed
casting me the flicker of a wink to-
morrow night i shall undertake your
ladys case tomorrow night we at-
tempt the cure au revoir monsieur
come away friend trowbridge we
must rest well before tomorrow
night

de grandin was silent to the point
of moodiness all next morning
toward noon he put on his outdoor
clothing and left without luncheon
saying he would meet me at evan-
ders that night

 meantime trowbridge mon
vieux i beg you will assist me in the
kitchen there is much to do and
little time in which to do it

  opening a large valise he produced
a bundle of slender sticks which he
began splitting into strips like basket-
withes explaining that they were
from a mountain ash tree when
some twenty-five of these had been
prepared he selected a number of
bottles from the bottom of the satchel
and taking a large aluminum kettle
began scouring it with a clean cloth

  attend me carefully friend trow-
bridge he commanded do you
keep close tally as i compound the
draft for much depends on the
formula being correct to begin
arranging a pair of apothecarys
scales and a graduate glass before
him on the table he handed me this
memorandum

        	drachms asafcetida
         oz hypericum

        oz aromatic ammonia
        oz gum camphor

  as he busied himself with scales
and graduate i checked the amounts
he poured into the kettle  voila
he announced we are prepared

  quickly he thrust the ash withes
into a pailful of boiling water and
proceeded to bind together a three-
stranded hyssop of ash poplar and
birch twigs

  and now my friend if you will
assist me we shall proceed he as-
serted thrusting a large washpan in-
to my hands and preparing to follow
me into the dining room with the ket-
tle of liquor he had prepared his lit-
tle brush-broom thrust under his arm

  we moved the dining room furni-
ture against the walls and de gran-
din put the kettle of liquid in the
dish pan i had brought in piling a
number of light wood chips about it
and starting a small fire as the
liquid in the kettle began bubbling
and seething over the flame he knelt
and began tracing a circle about sev-
en feet in diameter with a bit of
white chalk inside the first circle
he drew a second ring some three feet
in diameter and within this traced a
star composed of two interlaced tri-
angles at the very center he marked
down an odd-looking figure composed
of a circle surmounted by a crescent
and supported by a cross this is
the druids foot or pentagram he
explained indicating the star the
powers of evil are powerless to pass
it either from without or within
this he pointed to the central fig-
ure is the sign of mercury it is
also the sign of the holy angels my
friend and the bon dieu knows we
shall need their kind offices this
night compare friend trowbridge

if you please the chart i have drawn
with the exemplar which i did most
carefully prepare from the occult
books today i would have the testi-
mony of both of us that i have left
nothing undone  

  into my hand he thrust the follow-
ing chart

-	o

  quickly working like one pos-
sessed he arranged seven small silver
lamps about the outer circle where
the seven little rings on the chart in-
dicated ignited their wicks snapped
off the electric light and rushing in-
to the kitchen returned with the
boiled ash withes dangling from his
hand

  fast as he had worked there was
not a moment to spare for miss os-
tranders hysterical call dr de
grandin oh dr de grandin   came
down the stairs as he returned from
the kitchen

  on the bed mrs evander lay
writhing like a person in convulsions
as we approached she turned her
face toward us and i stopped in my
tracks speechless with the spectacle
before me

  it was as if the young womans
pretty face were twisted into a grim-
ace only the muscles instead of re-
suming their wonted positions again
seemed to stretch steadily out of
place her mouth widened gradual-

dr iyan brodsky put
down the morning paper
with a long whistle got up
put his hands in his pockets and
paced the room continuously too
bad too bad he kept repeating

  during the months that i had lived
with him and assisted him in the
psychical investigations which he car-
ried on i had learned one thing
above all others-to let him tell his
story in his own way so i waited
until he was ready to speak i could
not conceive what he had read that
had so agitated him and my aston-
ishment was increased fourfold when
he came and stood by my side wip-
ing the tears from his eyes unaffect-
edly

  rose celaye is dead he volun-
teered finally

  i tried to murmur something ap-
propriate but i must confess that
the announcement did not stir me
greatly of course like most others
i had heard of that wonderful woman

   note-this is the seventh of a series of stor-
ies each complete in itself dealing with dr
ivan brodsky the surgeon of souls

cellist who had blazed her trium-
phant path through all the capitals
of europe and america from buenos
aires to moscow i had seen the
notice of her death in her thirty-fifth
year and had forgotten that the doc-
tor like every pole had a passionate
love for music

  you knew her perhaps doctor
i faltered

  not in the body said brodsky
quite simply as though drawing
some obvious distinction but what
does that matter i heard her play
i heard her in carnegie ilall when
she went to new york last year and
dead rose celaye dead

  presently he came and sat down at
my side

  the world is poorer today than
it was yesterday he said to me
rose celaye was the greatest cell-
ist of the day if she had lived five
years longer she would have been the
greatest that ever lived but she was
more than a great player-she was a
woman of the most noble nature she
was never spoiled by the flattery that

weird

tales

she received she lived just as sim-
ple unaffected a life as always de-
voting all her income beyond the
amount necessary for living to the
encouragement of poor artists and
only live years ago when princes and
millionaires were at her feet she
married a poor clerk in a lawyers
office fo iove i believe their lives
were ideally happy i met him once
he offered to introduce me to his
wife but i would not meet her you
see i had heard her play i did not
aant to meet her in the flesh

vur psychical investigations occu-
 pied much of our time about
that period and this conversation
made little impression on me  it
must have been four  five months
afterward that it was recalled vivid-
ly to my mind when i entered the
doctors office a little late one morn-
ing and saw upon the hall table as i
went in the card of a visitor en-
graved auguste celaye inside
the man was taking off his gloves he
was about five-and-thirty years of
age as i should judge a creole in
appearance and possessed a striking
and dignified demeanor

 dr brodsky he began when
we had been introduced you will
have no recollection of me of course
although i once had the pleasure of
making your acquaintance for a few
moments at a reception

  on the contrary i remember you
very well replied the doctor

  i am extremely glad of it re-
turned the young man cordially be-
cause it will make my mission easier
i am not of course unacquainted
with the reputation that has come to
you from your remarkable investiga-
tions in psychic affairs i have al-
ways believed in such things and so
did my wife curiously enough she
often expressed the wish to meet
you and the fact that i did not in-
troduce you to her that afternoon was
the cause of our only disagreement

before her death she and i often dis-
cussed the possibility of the spirit
making itself manifest to mortals
and we resolved that whichever died
first he or she would return to give
proof of immortality to the other

 her death as you know was
comparatively sudden she lingered
in a semi-conscious state for perhaps
two hours after we realized that the
end was approaching toward the
last her mind grew clearer and she
motioned to me to bend over her in
a very weak voice she told me that
she was going to give me the proof
we had always spoken of she would
if possible play for me her transcrip-
tion of the wonderful heartbeat
march from the seventh symphony
of beethovc upon her cello it was
her favorite piece and mine and
then just before she died she spoke
your name

  after her death i was wild with
grief i locked away all her posses-
sions in a room of our apartment and
would not allow anyone to touch
them i traveled for some months
and arrived back last week time
had softened my excess of sorrow as
i suppose it must though the grief
will i know be permanent and
then for the first time i dared to
think of her promise but so great
was my dread of disappointment that
for several days i could not bring
myself to unlock the door of the room
in which her things were stored
finally i brought myself to it took
out her bow and cello which had
rested there untuned untouched for
months and placed them in my room
and waited in the darkness but
nothing occurred and at last i went
to bed and soon fell into a sound
sleep

  it must have been shortly after
midnight that i awoke with a start
i had dreamed of hideous discords
and the dream was verified upon
my ears there burst the wildest most
terrible medley of sounds that i have
the seventh symphony



ever heard they crashed out upon
the instrument in the most grotesque
manner imaginable and yet horrible
as it was the time and accentuation
seemed to be those of the seventh
symphony

  you can imagine my horror i
sprang from the bed and struck a
mateh instantly the sounds ceased
and yet when i drew near i saw the
strings quivering as though the hand
of the ghostly visitant had barely left
them that night i heard no more
but every night since then that hor-
rible noise awakens me at the same
time it lasts about as long as the
movement from the symphony and it
has the inexorable rhythm of that re-
lentless heartbeat march by which
beethoven suggested the march of
life from birth to death from the
grave to the grave  but it is a
cacophony of hideous dissonances
and it is always the same i know
the fearful tune by heart-if time it
can be called and all day long it
haunts me in imagination so i
should have gone mad if the remem-
brance of you had not suddenly come
to me last night when i was at the
summit of my suffering

  i took the first train from new
york this morning found your ad-
dress in the telephone book and have
come to beg you to solve the mystery
have i gone insane and do i imagine
it or is it that my wife has for-
gotten music in her present condition
of existence if that be so if char-
acter so change what does remain of
us or is it some devil that has
come back to mock and torture me

  he ceased and overcome by his
emotion leaned his head upon his
hand and regarded brodsky intently

  you are satisfied that these
sounds are produced without any hu-
man agency he asked

  absolutely the young man re-
plied moreover they are pro-
duced by some intelligent being for
the sounds are precisely the same on

each occasion it is almost as though
some travesty of the seventh sym-
phony had been written out so
identical is each performance with
the last

  then said brodsky you have
actually the proof of immortality
that you demanded what matter
the details of it why seek further
elucidation is it that the human
heart will not believe

  no replied celaye steadily it
is because i fear that the sounds are
made by some devil assuming her
identity

  well well have to go and see
returned the doetor its no use
forming hypotheses today we have
some work that must be finished here
tomorrow my assistant and i will be
at your apartment at  oclock in the
evening

elaye departed reluctantly leav-
 ing us an address in the portion
of new york city that adjoins
columbia university on our arriv-
ing at his apartment house a plain
but comfortable-looking structure
the elevator boy took us up to where
celaye stood waiting for us

 when we had concluded a very
pleasant meal celaye led us into the
large room which he used both as a
bedroom and a sitting room

  in one corner propped up against
the wall was the cello the bow beside
it brodsky advanced to inspect it
instantly celaye darted in front of
him his eyes blazing angrily to bar
the doctors progress

  you shall not touch it he cried
no hand but mine has ever been
laid upon it since she died

  brodsky stopped short and looked
at celaye with mild indignation

  i beg your forgiveness said the
young man humbly transformed
once more back to his normal con-
dition but i can not allow you to
touch it it is a foolish whim of mine


weird tales

-but i can not i can not explain
it but i must insist on this  

  my dear sir said brodsky se-
verely it is not at all essential to
my purposes that i touch the instru-
ment i did not desire to do so in
my capacity as doctor but merely
from the natural interest that i take
in musical instruments of such an-
tiquity  

  the young man flashed out eagerly
you recognize it he asked in de-
light it is a genuine carroba
made at leghorn in  pray look
at it he turned it forbrodskys
inspection but all the while seemed
ready to spring to the defense of it

 such old instruments have a
peculiar psychic value said brod-
sky thoughtfully well will it play
for us if we put out the lights

 we lowered the gas but not a
sound came from the instrument

  it only plays at  in the morn-
ing   said celaye   that was the
hour at which she died he added

  well sir said brodsky i
doubt very much whether it would
play for us all tonight even if we
were to sit up till that hour es-
pecially since you told me that the
sounds cease the moment that you
light the gas it is controlled evi-
dently by some power that is most
delicately attuned as you may
know the soul that returns to earth
is by no means a free being able to
communicate with the survivor upon
all possible topics were this so we
should have learned from such wan-
dering beings the secrets of their
own state by a wise provision the
soul can return only for some spec-
ial cause the mother to watch over
her babe the wrife to prove her con-
tinued existence to her husband the
miser to reveal some hidden hoard
the soul that returns is responsive to
one single emotion therefore our
presence alone would serve to neu-
tralize this

  is there no way then cried
celaye despairingly

  there is one way said brodsky
thoughtfully but it is a danger-
ous way and i would resort to it only
upon your solemn pledge that you
will never again resort to it so long
as you live it is the way so wisely
forbidden by moses the great law-
giver the way that saul utilized at
en-dor-the seance by the united
electrical powers of our bodies we
can when seated in a circle bring
about the effects we seek but there
are hosts of evil agencies ready to
rush in and usurp the functions of
our minds we must hold no com-
merce with these give them no free-
hold over us if therefore we sit
tonight may i have your promise
never to do so again   

  i promise replied the young
man solemnly

  when this had been done we put
out the gas lights and seated our-
selves around the instrument in such
a manner that without touching it
wre could by extending and joining
hands completely encircle it thus
we wtaited in silence for five ten
twenty minutes but nothing oc-
curred no sound came to break the
silence

     it will not play i know it   said
celaye abruptly rising and lighting
the gas jets sullenly he stood in the
center of the apartment over the in-
strument glaring at us defiantly
the doctor smiled

  at least you have one consola-
tion  he said if it had been some
mocking spirit that struck the strings
it would have come to us we can
dismiss that hypothesis well sup-
pose you put us up here for the
night  

  i will said the young man
eagerly his face clearing it was
evident to me that his swift moods
were rather the result of his nervous
tension than of a difficult nature
the seventh symphony



there is a bedroom adjoining i
will leave the door open and you
shall make yourselves comfortable
there if it does not play tonight at
least i shall be free from those ter-
rible jangles that haunt me

  while he was searching for pillows
and bedding i cross-questioned brod-
sky upon the failure of his plan

  i will tell you frankly why i
made that suggestion   he said to me
as i remarked if it had been some
devil as i suspected that played the
jangles it would have come eagerly
as you know the difficulty at the
seance table is not to obtain com-
munication but to keep off the lying
prankish elemental spirits that as-
sume the names and personalities of
the departed had any such creature
come i should have made some con-
ventional excuses to celaye and de-
parted the fact that nothing oc-
curred is highly satisfactory the
good spirit returns to this earth plane
only with great difficulty and tra-
vail well there will be nothing for
us to do except to wait

  we resolved not to undress but to
sleep or rest upon the coverlets we
sat up together until close upon mid-
night spending what would other-
wise have been a very pleasant eve-
ning our host was a man of vast
information and much culture and
by tacit consent no further word
was spoken regarding the object of
our visit shortly before midnight
celaye began to yawn

    i always become uncommonly
sleepy about this hour he said
with your permission i will leave
you and go to bed as though you were
not here so as to reproduce as nearly
as possible the exact conditions of
other nights

  a very excellent suggestion
said brodsky approvingly well
we will retire also and i think the
door may be as nearly closed as pos-
sible without preventing our hearing
anything that may happen

  we put out the gas in our room
and talked in whispers

  that sleepiness of celayes is
promising said brodsky confident-
ly sleep is an invariable precursor
of psychic phenomena as you have
found dont let yourself be over-
powered though and in about an
hour we shall hear something of
interest unless i am very much mis-
taken i only hope the sounds are
loud enough to reach us to one in
such a disturbed condition as celaye
the least murmur may appear a
thunderclap

t smile when i recall the doctors
words in spite of my resolution
i had fallen into a light doze-and
brodsky afterward confessed to me
that he too had yielded to sleep-
when i was awakened by a furious
grating noise in the large room i
was wide awake in an instant the
cello was moaning like a tortured
man thunderous discords fell from
it the strings grated and crackled as
though some lunatic were at the in-
strument i rushed to the door but
brodsky held me back

  it will cease if you enter he
whispered

  never do i hope to hear such music
again and what made it more hor-
rible there seemed to be some meth-
od in the playing of it there were
fearful parodies of motifs and
phrases the fingers struck the notes
clearly leaping from string to string
as the bow squeaked and scraped
across them a moment later the
door was flung into our faces as ce-
laye burst into the room

  i can not bear it he cried it
is not she that would be too hor-
rible light a match for the love of
heaven 

  the doctor found and struck one
and on the instant the noise ceased
brodsky and i ran across the room
and inspected the instrument the
strings were still vibrating but no

tales

sound came from them we stared
at one another in astonishment then
we heard celaye sobbing iii the next
room it took the doctor half an hour
to restore him to his normal self

  i can not help you he said at
length when celaye was dressed and
we three sat once more in the gas-
light if i had anything from
which to obtain inferences-but i am
helpless here the world of psyehic
phenomena is an unmapped chart
we are only beginning to explore the
coasts and boundaries but one thing
i would advise you destroy the in-
strument  

  never cried celaye his face
aflame she has come to me she
has tried to make herself intelligible
to give me the sign i asked for

  well i will not be responsible
for your sanity said brodsky curt-

ly-

  a lot i care for that retorted
celaye laughing bitterly man
he added fiercely snatching at the
doctors arm dont you understand
what is troubling me  my wife lived
for her music she lived in it it was
all in life to her except perhaps my
love and am i to believe that once
she has put on the garments of im-
mortality she has lost all her knowl-
edge of it so that she can only play
jangled hideous mockeries of what
she tries why if that be so then
indeed death changes us beyond all
recognition we are no longer the
same personalities that we have been
but something different we spend
our lives developing ourselves our
finer natures we hope and dream that
it is not for nothing and now-
must i believe that all this is thrown
away upon the rubbish heap and that
we become mere helpless automata
answer me answer

  his grief was pitiful to witness
but argument with him would have
been impossible his mind was be-
yond reason tottering as it was up-
on the borderland of madness

  i do not think that is so brod-
sky replied

  think shouted celaye spring-
ing to his feet his face distorted with
passion you are an impostor sir
i asked you here in good faith hop-
ing that you could give me back my
faith and confidence and you came
looking upon the matter as an ex-
periment you care nothing for my
grief only for your own amusement
dr brodsky i have the honor to
wish you good-night

  brodsky faced him unmoved his
cheek paled but all his muscles were
under complete control

 you have used hard words to
me he said- sometimes indeed
the wisest of physicians are at fault
and then it is our reward to be ac-
cused of imposition well sir it is
unnecessary for me to reply further
to your accusations i wish you
good-night

  i thought celaye would have come
to his senses then but to my aston-
ishment he made no answer of any
kind instead he sank into a chair
and burst into a fit of hysterical
weeping the doctor looked at him
in seeming irresolution for one mo-
ment then as though realizing the
impossibility of assisting him further
he took his hat and followed me out
of the door the sleepy elevator man
took us down-stairs

  well its a hotel in town for us
tonight said brodsky as we
marched down the deserted street
  there is a good hotel i used to visit
some twenty blocks from here what
do you say to a walk

  i agreed and we tramped on in
silence

tie must have eovered some half
v  a dozen blocks when brodsky
stopped on a corner

now why couldnt i solve that
mystery he asked abruptly and
continued on page 
the thing can be traced back
new to its beginning back
to a certain night in april to
the auditorium of the boston science
institute where dr walton delivered
his epochal lecture

  a lecture that few enough heard
at the time nor is that wonderful
outside the night was warm and
luring the first breath of spring for
a winter-weary world inside-only
a biologist lecturing it is hardly
strange that the audience that night
was a small one

  yet when walton emerged onto
the stage with the institutes presi-
dent he did not seem to notice the
rows of empty seats he was a quick
nervous little man of middle age
with thick black hair through which
he constantly ran his right hand
and black eyes that flashed restlessly
about while the smiling rotund
president introduced him to the audi-
ence with a few bland and cheerful
inanities walton was fidgeting nerv-
ously in his seat and when the other
had stepped back with a concluding

eulogistical phrase the little scientist
   w t-

sprang at once to the front of the
stage being greeted by a ripple of
mild applause at once he started to
speak with staccato rapidity

  the title of my lecture he be-
gan evolution and the future is
somewhat ambiguous so i will say
now that it is not my intention to
discuss old theories but to present a
newr one yet for my purpose it is
necessary to bring to your attention
first the general theory of evolution
as it is now known

  as you know before the promul-
gation of that theory it was general-
ly believed that all species all races
of living creatures had always pos-
sessed the same form and nature and
always would it was not thought
possible that in time a creature or
race of creatures could change entire-
ly in nature and bodily form devel-
op that is into a higher state of ex-
istence

 then came the great work of
darwin and wallace and huxley it
became clear that the only constant
thing in our world is change that in-
stead of remaining always in the

                                     

brilling turned suddenly toward the two

same forms life constantly changes
and develops into new forms up
from the first plasmic slime the base
of all life on earth life has advanced
through a thousand different forms
up a thousand branching paths sea-
slime-jelly-fish-invertebrates-rep-
tiles-mammals-man-up up al-
ways up striving climbing every
generation a tiny bit ahead of the
previous generation a tiny bit far-
ther advanced along the road of evo-
lution we know not where that road
leads for our path of evolution like
the paths all life must follow was
laid down for us as i believe by a
power above earth so although we
know not what forms we are chang-
ing into or what forms all other liv-
ing things change into we do know
that that change is going on infinite-
ly slowly but steadily how much
higher the human race today than the
savage neandertal men of fifty thou-
sand years ago and fifty thousand
years from now men will be as much
above us it is the same with all life
with all forms of life all go up up
change and change

 we can not swerve aside from
the path of change we follow but
suppose we could speed up our
progress could travel faster up that
path suppose we were able to ac-
celerate the process of evolution so
that a thousand years of evolutionary
development could be crowded into a
single day

  such a suggestion sounds mad
almost evolution is the slowest
process of nature and how could it
be accelerated to discover that we
must discover the cause of evolution
itself must find out ivhy we change
why all life changes

  that question the cause of evo-
lution is the great riddle of biology
countless explanatory theories have
been advanced adaptation segrega-
tion mutations mendelism-t could
recount a dozen such but all such ex-
planations have failed and the cause

of tiie evolutionary change has re-
mained a mystery a mystery which
i have finally solved and the an-
swer the force that drives life up its
myriad roads of change the very
cause of evolution itself is-the gar-
ner ray

  i imagine that the name is un-
familiar to most of you it is only
within the last few years that the
garner ray has been isolated by the
physicist whose name it bears even
yet the nature of the ray has re-
mained largely a mystery we know
however that the earth the universe
is one vast welter of vibrations vis-
ible and invisible from this ruck
of vibratory forces we can piek a few
that are known to science the hertz-
ian rays-that is the radio waves-
and chemical rays heat rays light
rays a vast welter i repeat of vibra-
tory forces

  and the garner ray is one of
these it is thought to be a new kind
of chemical ray having its source in
vast masses of radio-active substances
in the eartha interior it is also
thought that the ray is altered some-
how by the magnetic currents that
race between the poles whatever
its origin it is known that in some
places on the earth the ray seems ex-
ceptionally strong while in other
spots it is rather weak this is taken
to mean that the radio-active mate-
rials that are its source are unevenly
distributed in the earths interior

  you will want to know what con-
nection this ray has with the subject
of evolution it has such a connec-
tion and i have been the first to find
it we know the profound effects
that the other vibratory forces have
on life light rays for instance how
changed life would be without them
and this garner ray has an equally
important effect on life for it is the
constant action of this ray affecting
the nerve centers in a way i can not
explain that changes all of us men-
tally and physically that changes all
evolution island



life that causes the evolution change
itself since the first presence of life
on earth the action of this ray has
driven it upward to its present levels
and still drives it upward slowly but
unceasingly

  and i have proof that this is so
physicists have found that in the
continent of australia the ray is
weakest on earth due no doubt to
the fact that the radio-active bases of
it are scarce in the earth beneath the
island continent the ray is weakest
there has always been weaksst there
and what is the result any zoolo-
gist will tell you that australia
abounds with strange animals found
no place else on earth that evolution
there seems letarded slower it is so
even with the human beings there
the native australian the bushman
is without doubt the lowest form of
human being on earth the least de-
veloped of all the races of men

  i come now to the heart of my
interest i have shown you that this
garner rayj acting on all life on
earth has caused all the evolutionary
changes of the past i have shown
you that where the ray is strongest
the course of evolution is most rapid
and vice versa now suppose that we
were able to produce this ray arti-
ficially as we produce light and heat
and radio waves artificially sup-
pose we produced this garner ray in
the laboratory then concentrated it
condensed it focused it and turned
it on a human being what would be
the result

  walton paused and held up a lean
finger to emphasize his words
when that is done when an arti-
ficial garner ray is produced and
turned onto a human body the pos-
sessor of that body will be thrown
thousands of years ahead in mental
and physical development will be
thrown ages ahead of the rest of us
in point of evolutionary standing

  and if the same thing were done
to all of us it would have the same

effect on all would take ua ahead
thousands millions of years in de-
velopment depending on the strength
of the artificial ray think of the
countless ages it took life to crawl up
to the present human form and
then after those eons of painful prog-
ress this mighty jump this great
short-cut seven-league boots for
humanity on the road of evolution

  and this is no vain dream it
will be accomplished i do not say
that i can accomplish it myself but
it will be done if not in our time
in some time to come it will bo
done and then-the great trans-
formation i seem to see humanity
leaping up to full stature at once
springing from achievement to
achievement strong and conquering
i seem to see men become like gods

 



cven now one remembers the up-
roar created by waltons as-
tounding statements an uproar that
spread over the scientific world and
into the newspapers making a world-
figure of the obscure boston scientist
and too making him one of the most
denounced men in the world

  for his theories found no shadow
of acceptance nine scientists out of
ten when asked for opinions had it
that walton was either deluding him-
self or was an outright charlatan
evolution they pointed out was
after all only a theory a great
theory a basically important theoiy
but still a theory it belonged more
to philosophy than to science so
when walton treated evolution as a
laboratory matter and calmly pro-
posed to speed up the process it
seemed plain to them that he was
either slightly crazy or a skilful pub-
licity-seeker

  thus walton found himself uni-
versally condemned and strangely
enough seemed to mind it not at all
luckily for him he was not depend-


weird tales

ent on an academic position for his
existence since he had an ample in-
herited income so quite unaffected
by the storm he had raised he went
calmly on with his work spending
most of his time in the little labora-
tory building behind his home

  this home of his was an inherited
old-fashioned mansion a big ramb-
ling house that had formerly stood at
the center of an estate but was now
surrounded by the neat bungalows of
a modem suburb behind it stood
the little brick building that held his
laboratory and although walton had
made no statements after his lecture
he was generally believed to be at
work testing his theories in that
place none could say for certain
though for walton had but few
friends and admitted only one of
these into the laboratory

  the single favored one was stuart
owen a young physician who had
just returned after a months absence
from the city and who was eager to
learn more of the turmoil walton had
stirred up so directly after his re-
turn he had hurried out to his
friends home to hear more about the
matter

  as the two friends entered the
mam room of the laboratory building
a man working at a table there rose
and came to meet them this was
brilling waltons assistant a silent
hawk-nosed and thin-lipped young
man who mumbled a few words of
greeting and then hurried back to his
work owen then seized the oppor-
tunity to satisfy the question in his
mind

  this evolution business walton
he began you were hardly serious
about that were you i read the re-
ports of your lecture in the papers
you arent really working on a thing
like that are you

  no i was quite in earnest wal-
ton assured him brilling and i
have been working on the thing for
nearly two years  

  owens face showred his surprize
but man he protested it sounds
silly almost to speed up evolution
-you  never succeed  

  walton smiled slightly and ex-
changed a significant glance with his
assistant then but i have suc-
ceeded he said quietly

  as owen looked his amazement he
went on i suppose i can trust you
to keep the matter a secret for the
present owen and at the others
swift nod he continued well look
over here leading the way to a long
work-beneh

  a litter of electrical apparatus
covered the benchs surface and in a
clear space to one side stood a small
cylindrical case of black insulating
material which was studded on its
top with a number of small nickel
switches and connected by a dozen
wires to the electrical instruments
on the bench laying a hand on the
case walton remarked the fruit
of a years work this little instru-
ment owen is capable of producing
an artificial gamer ray that is many
times stronger than the natural ray
it is powerful enough to affect any-
thing inside this room to throw any
living thing in the room ages ahead
in evolutionary development the
ray itself is a chemical ray produced
by a combination of radio-active ele-
ments inside the case but it is
changed and altered by a series of
small but powerful electro-magnets
through which it passes

  as owen regarded the black cylin-
der dubiously walton said i see
that ill have to convince you an-
other way and made a gesture to
brilling who left the room returning
in a few minutes with a live chieken

  placing the chicken on the floor
beneath the bench walton took from
a drawer three narrow pads of gray
cloth one of which he handed to
owen and another to brilling as
owen examined the thing perplexed
by its unlooked-for weight walton
evolution island



told him a shield for you owen to
protect you from the ray when this
is strapped around your body cover-
ing your spine the ray will have no
effect on you it cant penetrate
through the lining of metal foil in
these pads and thus the vital spinal
nerve-centers are protected  

 when owen had awkwardly ad-
justed the shield to waltons satisfac-
tion his friend exclaimed now
watch and reaching over to the
black case snapped on a tiny switch
then stepped back and pointed to-
ward the chicken on the floor

  owen looked then gasped with as-
tonishment for the chicken was
changing-changing as he watched
the wings became smaller and small-
er shriveled away and vanished the
feathers became sparse and disap-
peared also the fowl became ever
more small dwindled contracted un-
til it was hardly larger than a robin
then fell dead a shrunken little bun-
dle of skin and bone owen looked
up to meet waltons smiling eyes

  you see asked walton snap-
ping off the switch you have just
seen the entire future of a species
have seen in a few minutes the
changes that species will go through
in the next few ages

  he turned to brilling who again
left the room returning with another
chicken

  im going to reverse the process
now walton said and throw this
one back in development in other
words you saw the future of the
species now ill show you the past

  but how- owen began then
his words were broken into by wal-
tons swift explanation

  easy enough once i had found
out how to produce the garner ray
the ray that accelerates evolution i
looked for a ray that would do the
exact opposite that would reverse
evolution and i found that all that
was necessary to produce a reversing
ray was to reverse the current in the

electro-magnets that alter the ray so
this reversing ray is the exact oppo-
site of the gamer ray the acceler-
ating ray and has an exactly opposite
effect therefore unless you want
to be thrown back a million years in
development see that your spine-
shield is on all right and he
laughed as owen nervously adjusted
the pad

  walton placed the second fowl in
the same position as the first but
took time first to secure it to the floor
by two large steel shackles which he
attached to its legs and which were
chained to the floor at owens ques-
tioning glance he smiled a neces-
sary precaution   he said then
reaching toward the ray-producing
case snapped on another switch
stepping instantly aside when he had
done so

  as owen watched the creature on
the floor fascinated it changed as
swiftly as the first but grew in size
instead of dwindling seemed to pass
with lightning speed through a hun-
dred different forms changing into
a large-sized fierce-looking bird with
coarse heavy plumage and a long
feathered tail with jaws instead of a
beak jaws that were lined with sharp
teeth

  archeopteryx said walton and
owen started an archeopteryx the
first known bird creature of the rep-
tilian age even as he stared at the
thing it was changing again passing
into a true reptile form a leathery-
skinned thing that strained at the
shackles holding it then there was
a swift flashing through a myriad
half-glimpsed reptilian forms pass-
ing down through a chain of slimy
sea-creatures and suddenly the
change had stopped and on the floor
lay a little heap of slimy viscous
substance

  protoplasmic sea-slime said
walton the first and lowest base of
life


weird tales

  owen found that his hands were
trembling as walton snapped off
the switch on the case he called to
him good god walton can you do
that with any creature and he
pointed a tremulous finger at the
slimy mass  the floor

  i can walton told him and
as soon as i have made experiments
on a big scale with the accelerating
ray ill try it on a human being-a
willing subject of course i will try
to throw him ahead enough to give
him advanced mental and physical
powers without taking him too far
on a big scale owen repeated
how can you do that if you spread
that accelerating ray over a big terri-
tory who knows what people might
be caught by its power and changed
who knows what would happen
walton waved away the objection
ive thought of that owen and
consequently were going to work
out the thing where it will be abso-
lutely safe to do so that is on an
island a little island town in the
west indies a few hundred miles
south of cuba which i bought at a
ridiculously low price its entirely
uninhabited now so thats my plan
to set up a larger ray-projector that
will cover the whole island with its
power then get a lot of different ani-
mals and turn them loose there you
see the idea every living thing on
the island will be under the influence
of the accelerating ray and thus
everything on the island will be
thrown ahead in evolutionary devel-
opment we can see hundreds of
thousands of years of development
condensed into a few weeks or
months of course brilling and i
will wear the shields to protect our-
selves but everything else will
change and we can keep records of
every change in each species photo-
graphs and notes and such its all
planned out owen brilling and i
sent our equipment down to a cuban

port some time ago and were leav-
ing ourselves next week for the is-
land

  i dont like it owen told him
theres something ghastly about the
whole idea you know that im not
a superstitious man but this plan of
yours-why youre twisting the very
basic laws of nature walton and no
one ever tried that yet but came to
wreck

  waltons face was dreaming ab-
stracted no owen every achieve-
ment of science has been heralded as
a tampering with nature and this
will be the greatest thing ever ac-
complished for humanity if we can
go through with it if our experi-
ments down there are successful we
will try it on the human body think
of it owen thousands millions of
years of development accomplished
in a flash if we can do it-

  owen did not answer and a silence
fell over the three men as he left
the laboratory he looked back and
saw on the floor the shining heap of
slime there a vague doubting fear
ran through him an oppressing fore-
boding of evil

  and that weighting fear clung
again to him a week later as he
watched a rusty tramp steamer go
out from a new york dock bearing
with it walton and brilling who had
contracted to be put ashore at the
cuban port where theii equipment
awaited them owen watched the
boat warp through the foggy mists of
early morning then walked slowly
back from the docks edge

  it was only then that it occurred
to him that he had no way of com-
municating with walton short of go-
ing to the island itself the outcome
of the whole matter would remain in
doubt for him until walton came
back until walton came back but
would he ever come back

  would he
evolution island





walton came back he came
back a year later  a stormy
night in may when the wind was
lashing the deserted streets with gusts
of cold rain owen lounging in his
rooms over a dull novel heard a sud-
den knocking at his door and when
he flung the door open a wet and
shabby figure staggered in that he
knew at once was his friend dur-
ing all that year he had had no word
from walton and now as he pulled
out a chair for the dripping swaying
figure before him he could restrain
his questions no longer

  slumped in the chair staring fixed-
ly at the opposite wall walton did
not seem to hear his eager queries
owen notieed then that the man
seemed years older his face drawn
and haggard his eyes dazed but at
a word in owrens speech sudden life
leapt into his expression

  the island he repeated yes
i come from there owen

  and brilling asked owen

  he is-alive was the slowt an-
swer

  shocked by the utter change in his
friend owen was silent for min-
utes walton stared vacantly ahead
then seemed to pull himself together
to become conscious of his surround-
ings for the first time turning to
owen he said slowly as though re-
peating a lesson i must go back
owen  

  you mean back to the island
asked the other and walton nodded

  i must go back he repeated
and soon i came to you-i can

tell you- again he fell silent

but owen did not disturb him wait-
ing until he spoke again

  with an effort walton resumed
the thread of his speech the is-
land-we went there brilling and i
that was only a year ago owen
only a year ago he seemed to
muse on the thought

  but brilling and i went there
you remember we went to lluegos
a cuban port first and arranged to
have our equipment taken down to
the island for us we took native la-
bor down and got the place ready
building a cottage for living quarters
and a small laboratory and setting
up our equipment there arranging
our supplies and we brought ani-
mals down to the island and turned
them loose there

  we got most of the animals from
the menagerie of a little traveling
circus that had stranded in lluegos
the hotel proprietor there was hold-
ing the menagerie of the show for an
unpaid bill and was glad enough to
sell them for next to nothing so we
had them taken down to the island
and turned loose there there was
a mangy old lion a couple of splen-
did young leopards wolves and so
on of course we had a stockade
around the cottage and laboratory to
keep them from getting too close

  when all that had been done
brilling and i were the only men on
the island having got rid of the la-
borers we had hired as soon as their
work was done we had a small
boat a yawl to come and go in and
by that time we had set up all our
equipment the main feature wtas a
big ray-projector like the one you
saw but much larger and more
powerful capable of throwing its ray
over the whole extent of the island
of course brilling and i wore the
shields night and day for our own
protection

  all was ready so we began turn-
ing on the accelerating ray though
not using near the full power at our
command we wanted the change to
be slow enough to record you see
two days went by and we could see
no change but on the third day we
noticed a changing in the lion and
the leopards the three big cats were
getting smaller were dwindling in
size every hour it seemed in five


weird tales

days they had become as small as
house-cats and were as tame the
seventh day we found them dead

  you see what it meant we had
seen in seven days the whole future
development of those two feline spe-
cies had seen the fate of all their
kind in the future and it was just
what we had expected ever since
the time of the saber-tooth tiger the
larger felines on earth have tended to
become ever smaller and less fero-
cious and thus we had seen the ulti-
mate end of the species a dwindling
into mere cats

  after that first transformation
the changes came thick and fast the
wolves changed next changed in na-
ture becoming as tame and gentle as
dogs they became dogs in fact
then they began to grow grew to a
great size became as large as horses
indeed but for all their giant size
they stayed as tame as ever final-
ly they dwindled too and died away
it was the end of that species and
the changes still went on

  we were living in a biologists
paradise owen were seeing the
whole futuie course of evolution see-
ing the future development of a
myriad different species with rifles
for our protection we ranged the
island constantly photographing and
recording the changes we saw con-
stantly observing the beasts as they
developed watching watching we
spared time only to eat and sleep

    we kept the ray-projector always
going always sending out the accel-
erating ray and always the things
on the island changed not only the
animals we had brought but the
things that had always lived on the
island snakes for instance there
were many of these and under the
accelerating ray they developed into
horrible forms some grew to python
size and even larger while some de-
veloped short legs and webbed feet
on which they walked and ran and
some took to the water as their na-

ture changed but in time all died
away disappeared

  after the snakes had died away
the birds on the island began to
change most of these died soon but
one breed evolved that lasted for a
few weeks a great condorlike thing
with brilliant plumage a giant bird
of prey that was the fiercest thing on
the island it attacked us whenever
we ventured out and we were glad
when it died too

  and still the changes went on
still the ray forced the life on the
island up and up in development
after the birds there came a change
in the insect life of the place and a
wave of strange monsters swept over
the island gigantic spiderlike beasts
monstrous flying creatures that were
like great wasps in some ways but
were the size of airplanes and pro-
portionately fierce all the insect
life on the island seemed to be de-
veloping into new and monstrous
forms that made the place a hell to
live in some of the things we only
glimpsed there was a worm-thing
for instance vast and white and slug-
gish a hundred feet in length that
flopped about in a swamp and uttered
hoarse bellowing cries we heard it
at night sometimes   and there
were others even worse but in time
all the insect monsters died away as
the others had done before them

  and to replace them came giant
reptilian creatures from the sea
strange sea-monsters of some future
age you see the ray acted on the
waters around the island too and
had the same accelerating effect on
all the life in them so it was that
we glimpsed strange things in the sea
around us vast scaled and fanged
creatures that fought and tore with
inconceivable ferocity they were
beasts of some future age but they
seemed to us like the hideous dino-
saurs of the past so large and fierce
were they some of them were am-
phibian and they made life precari-
evolution island



ous for us by venturing onto the is-
land and lumbering about crashing
through the forests and meeting and
battling with each other

nphe island was a strange place

  - then and even after the sea-
monsters had passed owen it was
strange a place of silence and death
for the ray had wiped out all animal
life on the island had thrown all life
ahead and ahead in development un-
til all had died away there could
be no more changes we thought and
we were wrong owen we were
wrong

  for there came another change a
last great change a terrible change
that neither brilling nor i had fore-
seen and that was a change in the
plant-life on the island in the vegeta-
tion all animal life on the place
had changed and passed and now the
plant-life was changing

  yet we might have expected such
a change evolution rules all plant-
life just as it does all animal life
just as all present species of animals
have come up from the beasts of the
mesozoic age so have all present
species of plants come up from the
giant ferns and conifers of that age
all plant-life on earth is slowly de-
veloping the same as animal life
and under the accelerating ray that
slow evolution of the plant-life on the
island began to speed up after all
animal life there had passed

  the plants changed owen trees
bushes weeds they shot up into
strange new forms dwindled and
passed and rose to still other forms
and finally after weeks of such
changes one type of plant began to
become dominant on the island to
crowd out all the others this was a
plant much like a large cactus in ap-
pearance but a plant that seemed al-
most animal in its activity and intel-
ligence it could wave its great feel-
ers about and exhibited many signs
of its growing intelligence and

gradually its roots began to wither
away gradually it became able to
move about at will no longer tied to
one spot by its roots

  i understood what we were see-
ing i understood then that some-
time in the far future when all ani-
mal life has died away from earth
the reign of the plants will begin
that a race of plants will evolve into
the uppermost form of life just as a
race of animals man is the upper-
most form now i saw that long
after man had gone down to extinc-
tion the world would be ruled by in-
telligent active plants

  and i became afraid owen who
could say what degree of power these
plant-things on the island might not
attain if left to grow unhindered
if we allowed them to go forward in
development under the accelerating
ray we might loose an evil spawn-
ing horror upon the world a thing
that should not be in our time

  and too i felt that my reason
was going after all the things i had
seen i felt that i must get back to
the world of men that i must make
some contact with my fellow-humans
if i wanted to preserve a balanced
mind so i proposed to brilling that
we turn on the reversing ray throw-
ing the plant-things back to harmless
vegetation then leave the island and
spend a month or so in one of the
west indian cities

  brilling refused he felt none of
my fears was entirely absorbed in
the things we were doing he urged
me to go though and finally i did
so taking the yawl and heading for
jamaica brilling said that he want-
ed to study the development of the
plant-things a few days more but
promised to turn on the reversing
ray within the next few days and i
was content with his promise so i
left leaving brilling on the island
alone-except for the plant-things

  i had my month in kingston
owen and then my thoughts turned


weird tales

back to the island it had been our
plan to get a new lot of animals and
turn them loose on the island like the
first bunch then turn on the revers-
ing ray and watch their changes as
they went back down through the
evolutionary development of the past
i was eager to get started on this so
at the end of the month i left king-
ston and went to the island i went
back and i found-

    how can i describe what i
found i found all my former fears
realized and found new horror too
i saw for the first time why brilling
had wanted to stay  the island

  he had turned the accelerating
ray on himself owen had removed
the shield from his body and had al-
lowed the ray to throw him forward
ages in development and i saw him
saw the shape that was his the shape
and form of all humanity ages from
now

  his head had grown very much
larger owen had grown to almost
twice its former size and had become
quite hairless though the features
seemed much the same but the body
owen there was no body as we know
it instead of a human body the
head was attached directly to a mass
of flesh round and squat which was
about half the size of a human trunk
and from this shapeless mass project-
ed four supple boneless arms of mus-
cles arms that were really long pow-
erful tentacles he could walk on
these tentacles or on part of them or
he could use all to grasp and hold
four long twisting tentacles that had
once been arms and legs for i saw
in brilling the changes that future
ages will work in the human body
you know owen that the human
body tends constantly to become
simpler less complex in organization
the toes grow smaller less prehensile
and shrink away the hair disappears
and certain organs of the body like
the appendix become entirely useless
atrophied all our complex digestive

and respiratory apparatus tends al-
ways to become simpler and i saw
in brilling the cumulative effects of
ages of such changes

  and he had changed mentally
too he knew me his mind retained
all its former memories and knowl-
edge but it had acquired also new
thoughts new ambitions new de-
sires struck with horror at the
change in him i proposed to turn the
reversing ray on him and throw him
back to a normal human body but
when i made that suggestion he was
furious a body like mine he de-
clared would be loathsome to him it
was just as if i had suggested to a
normal human being that he allow
himself to be turned into a low-
browed caveman the thought re-
volted him and then i saw that this
creature was no longer the brilling
i had known but was a man of a
million years from now or more a
creature of a far-off future time
and i realized that even more fully
when i heard his plans when i dis-
covered what he had done in my ab-
sence

  i found that instead of turning
on the reversing ray after my depart-
ure he had allowed the accelerating
ray to stay on and thus instead of
bringing the plant-things back to
harmless vegetation he had allowed
them to develop still further to de-
velop into active intelligent crea-
tures

  he told me that exultant and
when i could not believe took me to
the other end of the island and
there i sawr the proof of his words
saw for the first time-the plant-men

  i call them plant-men for they
were roughly human in shape more
human-shaped in fact than brilling
himself they walked erect on two
limbs and had two arms or feelers
and between their-shoulders-they
carried a bulbous mass in which were
set their eyes two circles of blank
dead white with which they could
evolution island

see but there all human resemblance
ceased owen there were no other
features in the blank faces and
the bodies the mass of the
things seemed to be composed of
dark-green fiber coarse and stringy-
looking and as brilling told
me they remained true plants
for all their intelligence and ac-
tivity since they took in their food
as inorganic materials and utilized it
by means of the chlorophyl in their
bodies a thing that only a true plant
can do plants owen but moving
seeing reasoning the things knew
brilling they were friendly to him
crowded around him obeyed his or-
ders and he had allowed them to
develop in hordes and now boasted
to me that they would be his servants
his agents his armies

  his armies for that was the
plan he revealed to me that was his
great scheme he meant to develop
great numbers of the things to raise
up a vast army of them on the island
then send them rushing out onto the
world having them make and take
with them many powerful ray-pro-
jectors which would be set up in the
world outside and which would
sweep the earth with the accelerating
ray you see the result they
would spread the deadly accelerating
ray over all the earth and after all
animal life had changed and passed
as it had done on the island then the
earths plant-life would change
would evolve into new vast hordes of
plant-men they would go on on
raising new hordes from the very
ground itself and finally so brilling
said when his hordes had swept over
all the earth they would reach out to
other worlds sweep from planet to
planet in irresistible force

 t t was the plan of a crazed brain
owen a mad scheme that struck
me through with horror for i saw
that brilling could do it could loose
the hordes of the plant-men on the

world and sweep the earth with th
accelerating ray and i never doubt-
ed but that after he had done that
the plant-men would brush him from
their path after they had attained
supremacy but by then the evil
would have been done and brilling
was asking me to join him in his
plan was asking me to submit myself
to the accelerating ray and become a
thing like himself then join him in
this terrible project

  i knew better than to refuse him
outright i pretended to accept the
suggestion and we agreed to turn the
accelerating ray on myself the next
day and that night i fled from the
island

  i had planned to get into the
laboratory and to the ray-projector
to turn on the reversing ray and re-
duce the hordes of plant-men to mere
vegetation again but when i crept
down to the laboratory building late
that night i found it guarded by a
score of the plant-men and knew that
brilling was taking no chances and
i knew it would be impossible for me
to break through that guard i had
a pistol but who could kill a plant
with a gun and these plant-men
were armed armed with a strange
weapon that threw intense devouring
flame a daggerlike thing that spurt-
ed out puffs of flame and oxygen
simultaneously so that whatever re-
ceived that flaming discharge took
fire at once brilling had devised the
weapon for them and it was a ter-
rible one i knew

  what could i do if i stayed on
the island i could do nothing for the
next day brilling would turn on me
the accelerating ray making of me a
monster like himself and if i re-
fused he would kill me i knew so
i made my way down to the beach
to the yawl there and left the island
heading north for cuba i feared
pursuit for i knew the powers brill-
ing had at his command but no pur-
suit came and i got safety to liu


weird tales

egos and there i hesitated what
could i do i could not spread the
alarm and take a force down to the
island to destroy the menace there i
knew that against brillings new
weapons such a force could do noth-
ing and who would have believed
my story had i told it but if i
could go back to the island by stealth
if only with a single friend to help
me much might be done so i
caught a new york steamer and came
north to you the one person i
thought i could count on

  so i came and now i must re-
turn i came to ask you to go back
with me even now we may be too
late but you know all now owen
will you go back with me

  owens face expressed his doubt
you know that i dont doubt your
story walton but it seems so utter-
ly strange it seems impossible that
there could really be such a thing
such a menace-

  walton spoke solemnly there
is such a menace owen and it is
a menace such as was never known
before a destroying blight that will
blot out our world if it is not checked
do you think i dont feel the strange-
ness of the thing coming north in
the yawl i felt myself going mad
thinking of it down there on the
island brilling or the creature that
once was brilling is working plan-
ning preparing urging his hordes
of plant-men on and on coming near-
er and nearer to the climax of his
plans

  and soon out from the island
will sweep the hordes of the plant-
men killing and spreading terror
setting up the ray-projectors and
sweeping the world with the deadly
accelerating ray and then-horror
and death and confusion undreamed
of over all earth familiar animals
changing into hideous monsters in-
vasions of strange beasts scourges of
gigantic insect-terrors vast sea-things
pulling down ships at sea and most

horrible of all men and women
changing into shapes of terror like
brilling men and women changing
into hideous creatures like him a
world of monstrous changes a world
where all life changes and passes
and then at the last a world where
all animal life has died away and
vanished forever and then the last
great change the plant-life of the
world springing out into new and
dreadful shapes rising up into
hordes of the plant-men and at the
end reigning supreme from pole to
pole-the plant-men

  walton ceased speaking his face
pale his eyes burning owen rose
from his chair sickened by the pic-
ture the other had brought to his
mind then turning swiftly he
asked when do we leave walton

  a faint smile passed over waltons
face the first owen had seen there
since his return i knew i could
count on you owen   he said
theres a boat for havana tuesday
morning we can get that

forty-eight hours later the two
men stood at the rail of a fruit
line steamer watching the new york
skyline fade into the distance behind
them as the boat went down the bay
neither spoke then

  havana then lluegos a colorful
little port on the southern coast of
cuba they wasted no time there
transferring their baggage at once to
waltons yawl which had been held
there for him a few hours after
reaching the port they were swinging
out of the harbor in the yawl a
ketch-rigged craft with an auxiliary
motor ahead nearly three hundred
miles of the caribbean sea lay be-
tween them and the island that was
their destination

  out of the harbor they went past
the spongers and fishing boats past
a gleaming white pleasure-yacht out
to the blue open sea steadily the
little boat forged south under a
evolution island



dancing breeze and braced against
the mast owen looked out ahead
across the waters wondering in his
heart what soul-sickening horror
they were rushing toward what de-
stroying terror lay in wait for them
beyond the horizon night rushed
swiftly down upon them bringing
with it the blazing tropic stars and
later the shining splendor of the full
moon still owen peered ahead
across the silvered moonlit waters
while at the wheel behind him his
face set and grim walton held south
south

  once that night shortly before
midnight they passed a great liner
that was heading north to havana
it was a giant cruise-ship its upper
works ablaze with dazzling lights its
top deck crowded with swirling pas-
sengers dancing to the music of-the
ships orchestra across the waters
the lilting melody came clearly to the
two men but they held to their
course unheeding

  a few at the rail of the big liner
saw the speeding sail-boat and idly
speculated on its identity and errand
but none there dreamed the truth
none guessed the strangeness and
greatness of the mission on which the
yawl fled south racing down toward
the little island  which was cen-
tered the fate of all the world



t t was night when the yawl reached

  the island a deep thick night as
yet unrelieved by the expected moon
for hours owen and walton had
tensely scanned the sea ahead and
now as they made out a distant dark
mass that stood out dimly against the
starlit sky the tension of their nerves
seemed to become even greater in
silence owen stared at the place
while walton expertly guided the
little boat through a maze of rocks
and shoals

  silently they swept in toward the

island toward a long sandy beach
that gleamed in the faint starlight
a little channel indented the beachs
outline and into this walton steered
the yawl its keel grating and grind-
ing over the sand then stopping en-
tirely speaking in whispers the two
men secured the boat to a near-by
boulder with cables then discussed
their plan of action

  at waltons direction owen care-
fully adjusted the pad that protected
his spinal nerve-centers from the
deadly ray walton doing likewise
they then strove to come to a de-
cision on their next step

  the ray-projector is our best
chance walton told the other if
we can get to it and turn on the re-
versing ray full power it will wipe
out all life on the island except our-
selves the island is long and nar-
row with a high ridge at its center
running its full length and the cot-
tage and laboratory are on the south-
ern end i think that the main camp
of the plant-men is on the eastern
beaches on the other side of the
island from us so we had best head
toward the southern end at once and
try to make our way into the labora-
tory there  

  owen assented and the two began
to move stealthily along the beach
after a short distance walton sud-
denly turned inland and started up
the long slope toward the central
ridge that was the back-bone of the
island owen following in his steps
and as he followed owen noted the
bareness of those slopes since they
were only rock and sand not even
the commonest forms of weeds or
vegetation grew on them had every
scrap of plant-life on the island been
transformed by the accelerating ray
been changed into hordes of plant-
men he shuddered at the thought

  half-wtay up to the ridge walton
stopped abruptly and held up a warn-
ing hand from somewhere in the
darkness ahead came a thin wailing


weird tales

sound a high-pitched whispering that
came and went and came again to
their ears as they listened it
seemed to grow louder nearer and a
few pebbles rattled down the slope
from above and now they could
plainly hear the sound of feet many
feet shuffling down the bare slope
toward them

  instantly the two had sprung to
the concealing shadows of a near-by
cluster of giant rocks and lying
crouched behind these peered out at
what might be approaching they
heard a louder sound of shuffling
tramping feet then down the slope
and into view came a mass of dark
figures that moved steadily past their
place of concealment passing down
the slope toward the beach not un-
like a crowd of men owen thought
watching them pass in the dim misti-
ness of the starlight as they filed
by their wailing whispers came clear-
ly to his ears the sibilant murmur of
their speech

  before half of the marching figures
had gone by a ghostly glow of white
light had poured up from behind the
ridge above and now there floated up
into the sky like a shining bubble
the full moon laving the scene be-
fore them with its molten silver light
as that revealing light poured down
on the passing shapes owen grasped
his companions arm with a sudden
intake of breath

  the plant-men he whispered
and walton nodded silently

  together and with a common hor-
ror they watched the passing tilings
there seemed nothing human about
the creatures under the bright moon-
light mottled-green travesties on the
human shape they seemed masses of
stringy fiber carelessly cast into a
semi-human form it was the faces
of them that held owens gaze blank
expanses of smooth green in which
the two eyes circles of dead white
stood out dreadfully staring and un-
winking

  he had time only to note that the
passing plant-men seemed to be car-
rying with them a number of large
metal tools or instruments and then
they had all gone by and the two
crouching men heard them shuffling
down onto the beach and along the
shore for minutes they waited
listening but no further sound came
to them so they rose and continued
up the slope doubly cautious after
their unexpected encounter with the
plant-men

  the moonlight made their progress
easier now and in a few minutes they
stood on the very top of the ridge
from which they could survey nearly
all the islands surface

  instantly the attention of the two
was riveted on the distant beaches at
the islands eastern side for there
were lights there masses of small
gleaming lights that came and went
continually moving about in swirls
and eddies like fireflies and some of
these were gathered into clusters
here and there

  along the distant beaches these
lights were present for a distance of
nearly two miles and perhaps far-
ther since a rolling fold of the slope
beneath them partly cut off their
view ip that direction as they
watched a distant clangor of metal
came to their ears from the direction
of the lights faint and far a mighty
hammering of metal on metal that
came to their ears on the wings of a
little breeze then died away they
listened and it came again and
again

  the main camp of the plant-
men walton whispered there
must be thousands of them down
there judging from those lights

  what are they doing walton
asked owen you heard that ham-
mering theres something big go-
ing on down there

  walton nodded watching the dis-
tant lights god knows what
theyre up to down there whatever
evolution island



it is brilling is directing it you may
be sure we can do nothing there
though   and he turned away from
the east and glanced around then
tugged at owens sleeve pointing
silently toward the northern end of
the island

  a light was gleaming in that direc-
tion also a steady unwinking beam
that was nothing like the flitting il-
luminations in the east   that light
is from the cottage walton whis-
pered thats our objective and
he started along the ridge toward
the north

  again owen followed and the two
moved silently along the ridge to-
ward the distant light which as they
drew nearer showed itself to be a
square lighted window the ridge
sloped down as they drew near the
islands northern end and in a few
minutes they had come to within a
half-mile of the stockade which en-
closed the cottage and laboratory and
which lay down the slope a little be-
low their present position

  down they crept until they could
plainly see the cottage in the moon-
light a small one-story affair beside
which was a long low building that
owen knew to be the laboratory

  walton jerked a finger toward the
latter building the ray-projector
is in there he whispered and if
you can get inside remember that
the reversing ray is turned on by the
extreme left-hand switch if we can
just get into the laboratory the
gate of the stockade is open and i
dont see anyone around brilling is
not using the ray-projector at all
now for he turned off the acceler-
ating ray after the plant-men were
fully developed but if we can send
out the reversing ray-

  heart beating rapidly owen fol-
lowed his friend stealing down to-
ward the open gate of the stockade
there was no sound or movement
in the lighted cottage nor in the

clearing around the two buildings
his hopes ran high as they crept on

  down down keeping as much as
possible within the sheltering shad-
ows they went on and now were
passing through the open gate of the
stockade were moving soundlessly
across the clearing toward the little
laboratory building whose open door
beckoned to them like a magnet

  a hundred feet from that open
door owen heard a sudden sound of
running feet and wheeling quickly
saw a little knot of dark shapes
rushing through the stockade gate to-
ward walton and himself the plant-
men 

  walton he cried and saw his
friend turn swiftly from one of the
racing plant-men a burst of green
fire suddenly sprang out toward
the two men barely grazing them
before the deadly flame could be
again thrown at them a high shrill
call sounded from the cottage a wail-
ing scream flung toward the running
plant-men like a command owen
had a momentary glimpse of a
strange squat figure outlined against
the door of the lighted cottage then
the mass of plant-men was pouring
down on walton and himself

  his automatic flashed into his hand
and roared once twice but the near-
ing plant-men rushed on unhurt by
the bullets that ripped through them
he heard a wail of utter despair
from walton an exultant shrill cry
from the cottage and then the plant-
men had rushed down on him in a
solid wave knocking him from his
feet something hard descended on
owens head with stunning force
and as he sank to the ground a great
curtain of orange flame seemed to be
unrolling itself in his brain then
he felt himself falling falling
tumbling down through bottomless
depths of blackness and silence into
complete unconsciousness

weird tales



-vven awoke to find his hands and
fcet tightly bound he was
sprawling in the clearing against the
wall of the cottage beside him lay
walton similarly secured and he
saw that no great time had passed
since their capture for it was still
dark although in the east a faint
gray light was beginning to pale the
brilliance of the stars

  from where he lay he could see
most of the clearing and he noted the
extraordinary activity there the
place swarmed with the plant-men
hurrying to and fro on enigmatic
errands a high thin voice was
directing their movements from the
door of the cottage and owen
squirmed into a position from which
he could see the voices owner he
looked then shuddered with deep
loathing at the thing he saw

  it was brilling that stood there
brilling as walton had described him
as the accelerating ray had left him
the enormous bald head the dull
white skin the shapeless mass of
flesh that was the body with four
twisting tentacles on two of which it
supported itself as owen stared
at the monstrosity it caught his
gaze and came down toward the two
standing in front of them brilling
regarded the bound pair with mock-
ing interest

  so you came back walton he
shrilled and you too owen for
what i wonder and brilling
laughed terribly

  neither owen nor walton replied
and this seemed to enrage the mon-
ster before them

  you came back in time to see my
triumph he raved the beginning
of my reign he scanned the east-
ern sky then flung a muscled tentacle
up in sudden exultation look you
fools he cried pointing toward the
east

  both looked in that direction to-

ward the misty light of dawn when
something there caught their atten-
tion something round and black that
was drifting up into the sky from the
distant eastern beaches up and up
it floated and now a far humming
sound came to their ears a purring
whine that grew to a loud droning
as they watched the first rays of
sunlight struck the thing in the air
and they saw it clearly it was a
vast globe of metal a giant sphere
that glinted dully in the sunlight a
huge globe all of a hundred feet in
diameter floating up into the sky like
a weightless bubble

  the droning intensified increased
another of the round black shapes
was floating up in the east following
the first and another and still an-
other then a cluster of them until
all of fifty gigantic globes hovered a
mile above the islands eastern side
circling droning massing

  brilling turned to the two bound
men his face alight with evil tri-
umph my armies he boasted
my plant-men his eyes were
glowing they go to spread death
in your world to sweep earth with
the accelerating ray and even as
he spoke the two saw the globes mov-
ing slowly across the island passing
out in compact formation high
above

  his face upturned in the morning
sunlight brilling watched them go
owen turned toward his friend then
his heart leaped with sudden hope
for walton was stealthily rubbing
the ropes that bound his hands
against a sharp edge of stone that
projected from the ground beside
him

  owen saw that none of the plant-
men remained in the clearing that all
had hurried away to the eastern
beaches to watch the launching of
the flying spheres and he saw that
brilling was still intent on the
massed globes above which were now
passing out from above the island
evolution island



out over the sea from a comer of
his eye without turning he saw that
walton was fumbling at his foot-
bonds having freed his hands

  brilling suddenly turned his atten-
tion toward the two prisoners and
for you two he resumed death

  he turned and uttered a shrill call
a call that was echoed in the distance
by a group of plant-men returning
toward the clearing and even as he
voiced that call walton had jumped
to his feet and sprung knocking
brilling to the ground where the two
rolled over and over clutching and
holding each other

  the four long tentacles coiled
swiftly around walton grasping him
in an iron grip and at the same time
brilling cried out again to the ap-
proaching plant-men a hasty shrill
command that was instantly an-
swered by the latter whom owen
could see in the distance racing to-
ward the aid of their master and
a hundred feet across the clearing
was the open door of the laboratory

  with a sudden convulsive move-
ment owen rolled away from the cot-
tage wall and out into the clearing
twisting squirming rolling he pro-
gressed across the clearing pass-
ing the struggling walton and brill-
ing working his way toward the open
door that meant life or death for the
world a chorus of wailing shouts
came to his ears as the plant-men
sped toward the clearing but owen
rolled on all his being centered on
that giant black cylinder inside the
open door and the switches on its
front and on a single switch at the
extreme left-hand side

  the left-hand switch he was at
the door now had rolled inside and
was madly striving to squirm into an
upright position against the great
cylinder would his bonds baffle
him even now as he flung himself
to his feet with a supreme effort he
saw the plant-men race into the
clearing heard brillings command

and saw them race past the strug-
gling pair toward the laboratory
they were coming-coming-

  leaning far over owen grasped
the left-hand switch between his
teeth as he did so the first of the
plant-men raced into the laboratory
swung up one of the daggerlike
flame-throwers toward him but
even as the deadly weapon was lev-
eled full toward him owen had
jerked down the switch between his
teeth by a quick movement of his
head snapping it wide open for a
fraction of a moment there was an
utter silence

  then from outside came a sudden
wailing cry faint and fading and
as owen stared trembling he saw
the plant-men before him wavering
hesitating saw their outlines soften
melt and change seemed to glimpse
them flashing through a thousand
forms with lightning speed then melt
down to mere heaps of green slime
masses of green slimy scum that
smeared the floor and ground where
the plant-men had stood

  out beyond the open door he saw
walton stagger to his feet gazing in
utter amazement at the heaps of slime
around him then reeling unstead-
ily into the laboratory walton had
cut his bonds and the two walked out
into the clearing looking about as if
unable to credit the miracle they had
wrought

  slime slime that lay where
brilling and the plant-men had
moved a moment before slime that
lay wherever the plant-men had been
gathered all life on the island
save for the shielded two had sunk
down to the first base of life under
the full power of the reversing ray
had flashed down to slime like that
which covered the tidal beaches ages
before

  walton shouted now and pointed
out toward the sea the massed
globes there that had been speeding
away from the island were wavering


weird tales

halting driving about confusedly the
droning of their operation dying
and ceasing as one after another
they plunged down into the sea with
great splashes spinning down into
the sea when the plant-men inside
them were smitten down by the reach-
ing powerful ray smitten down-
to slime

  the last of the flying globes
splashed down and vanished and
walton and owen turned and looked
at each other there were tears
standing in their eyes over the
island lay a thick stupendous silence



 s their little sailboat swept
across the waters walton and
owen stood at its stern watching the
island drop behind in the west the
setting sun hung at the waters edge
a great flaming door into which the
sea seemed to be pouring and re-
membering the utter despair with
which they had come down to the
island so short a time before owen
felt infinitely grateful infinitely
humbled

  waltons thoughts were on some-
thing else brilling gone he
said the plant-men all gone the
ray-projector destroyed by us-and
i alone know how to make another
you are hardly likely to make
another are you    asked owen
smiling but there was no smile on
waltons face as he answered

  no all that is finished now but

it was close-close-

  as the two watched the island sink
behind them a silence fell on them
a silence of complete understanding
the sun had dropped down beneath
the horizon now and they could
hardly see the island in the darken-
ing twilight a moment longer they
glimpsed it a dark mass wavering
against the distant skyline then it
had passed had blended into the
thickening dusk

  with a sigh owen turned around
and more slowly walton did like-
wise shoulder to shoulder they
looked out ahead thus the little
yawl clove the waters speeding stead-
ily north through the swiftly gather-
ing night 

a requiem

neobule being tired

far too tired to laugh or weep

from the hours rosy and gray

hid her golden face away

neobule fain of sleep

slept at last as she desired

neobule is it well
that you haunt the hollow lands
where the poor dead people stray
ghostly pitiful and gray

plucking with their spectral hands
scentless blooms of asphodel

neobule tired to death
of the flowers that i threw
on her flowerlike fair feet

sighed for blossoms not so sweet
lunar roses pale and blue

lilies of the world beneath

neobule ah too tired
of the dreams and days above
where the poor dead people stray
ghostly pitiful and gray

out of life and out of love

sleeps the sleep which she desired
  a round the hospital folks said
that john dorsey was a nice
-i il old man-kind of puttery but
still a mighty good all-rsund m d
he was small and mild and chubby
and had soft white hair-the sort of
kindly old gentleman you see telling
stories to the kiddies in the park

  old john had his ways too pecul-
iar maybe but harmless he was
unobtrusive and fitted well into the
general scheme of things around the
hospital unobtrusive that is except
when the emergency cases came in
old john was an emergency special-
ist the ambulance boys would bring
em in screaming moaning or some-
times huddled up in a silent blood-
stained heap under the stretcher cov-
erings and rush them into old johns
emergency parlors as one of the
young college interns used to term it

  the ambulance boys would some-
times call me in from the oiderly
room to help them with some poor
devil who had gotten more than his
share of hard luck at a grade cross-
ing smash at these times t noticed

that old john wasnt the same as he
generally appeared to be he would
flash into action as quickly as any
first aid man in the front line trench-
es ever did old john had his own
operating room and as he didnt
have much else to do he always kept
things in readiness for the emergency
cases the water in the sterilizing
basin was always gently simmering
over the sharp wicked-looking things
with which he did his wonder-work
the bandages the antiseptics and the
sponges were always laid out in readi-
ness on a long table which he kept
close at his side while operating

	here is where old johns pecu-
liarity cropped out-he would not use
an assistant or have another person
in the room the moment he heard
the ambulance siren-and he always
heard it before any of the rest of us
did-he would hurry to his room and
by the time we had the howling un-
fortunate stripped and laid out and
under the ether old john would
know what the trouble was and be
ready and waiting to begin

weird tales

  clear out of here hed say
good-naturedly but stay close
around outside the door where i can
call you if i need you

  only he never seemed to need any
help

  but after all there wasnt so much
use for an assistant in the kind of
emergencies we handled the very
messy cases often died in the ambu-
lance boys arms much to their dis-
gust and the poison cases were taken
care of with a stomach pump on the
way to the hospital the majority of
old johns patients required only to
have a shut-off jammed on a squirt-
ing artery or a splintered bone
yanked out of some vital organ in a
hurry

  seems like with just me and the
patient in there by ourselves with
no fool girl to get pale and shiver and
act heroic and everything right
where i can reach it without having
to ask for it or fall over somebody i
can do my best for a patient in the
least time-and thats what counts
so spake old john and no one dis-
agreed

  one time mccarty said something
kind of queer about old john mc-
cartys the slim young doctor who
wears the thick horn-rimmed glasses
and smokes so many cigarettes it
was when some italian window-wash-
er did an eleven-story nose-dive to
the pavement and smashed himself
all up he didnt look very bad
though so the ambulance boys rushed
him in to old john anybody with
any sense at all would have known
the wop would cash in inside of five
minutes but as an m ds business
seems to be taking nothing for grant-
ed old john ran everybody out of
the room as usual and went to work
pretty soon-according to mccarty-
old john came to the door shaking
his head kind of sorrowful-like and
said too late boys the way he
always does

  humph said mccarty with a

queer sideways look through those
big glasses of his it does seem as if
it took dorsey a long time to find out
that man was dead and listen
jack-he looked up and down the
hall before he spoke-old john
didnt put his rubber gloves on all
the while he was in there must
not have even examined the man  

 not being as smart as some i
didnt see anything special about that
to bowl anybody over but i kept
still i wasnt there when it hap-
pened being busy at the time on the
fifth floor sitting on the chest of
some looney fever-case who thought
he needed an airing out on the  fire
escape after the little blond nurse
in ward  gave him a shot in the
arm and got him quiet she said to
me gee but youre strong and i
kind of grinned and-

  but as i was saying old john sure
did do some wonderful things there
by himself in that room one time
he took a bullet out of a fellows
head-i forget the long names the
m ds called the operation-but it
made the other doctors sit up and
take notice of course a lot of the
emergency cases died-but thats
why theyre emergency cases-be-
cause theyre dying none of the
deaths were old johns fault

well things went on as usual
for a while the interns and
me bribing the drug room man to
give us our little drinks of prescrip-
tion whisky the nurses smoking their
cigarettes up in the roof-garden and
the ambulance boys charging the
hospital double for every tire they
bought

 one day along in the spring
when the auto-wreck cases began to
pile in old john asked me to go
down to the supply room and get him
a new pair of surgeons gloves i
said i would and while i was down
there rummaging around i heard the
ambulance siren but didnt think
soul-catcher



anything about it i came back up-
stairs with the gloves and went to
old johns room the door was
closed and nobody was around i
suppose if id stopped to think i
would have guessed that old john
had an emergency case in there but
i didnt-i went right on in now
working around a hospital just
naturally gets you to be mighty light-
footed and with the noiseless door
and soft floorrpad i guess i must not
have made a sound old john had
his back turned and didnt hear me
come in for a moment i looked then
sank back against the wall and stared
while my eyes popped out and i be-
gan to sweat

  there was one of the usual busted-
up fellows all bloody and out-of-
joint lying on the operating table
under the strong light over him
bent old john holding in his hands
a light rectangular frame about six
feet long and two feet wide inside
the frame was stretched the queerest
webbiest fine net-work i ever saw
the netting wasnt wire and it wasnt
thread-i dont know what it was
a big black wire ran all the way
around this frame under the handle
by which old john was holding it
and into a- round glass jar the
whole thing kind of reminded me of
an old-fashioned indoor radio aerial
as i stood and looked i could see
that the patient was pretty far gone
but that didnt seem to worry old
john he stood very quiet very
tense-and waited soon the figure
on the operating table quivered a lit-
tle then sighed and went limp all
over the way they do

  right then is when the hair start-
ed to rise up on the back of my neck
for just a second after that fellow
had passed out the thin delicate net-
ting in the big frame began to flutter
as if something had got tangled up in
it-something you couldnt see then
the glass jar that was hooked up with
the big black wire began to fill up

just as if someone was blowing cigar-
ette smoke into it only this stuff was
thicker and gray-colored-not bluish
like cigarette smoke pretty soon the
net quit quivering and the jar was
full of this smoky stuff old john
laid down the frame on the dead man
unhooked the wire and held the jar
up to the light

  got him all right he chuckled
to himself

  i guess i must have moaned dr
made some kind of a noise about
then for old john wheeled quick as
a cat and when he saw me his eyes
blazed up like a bad brain-fever
cases i dont know how long we
stood like a couple of stone statues
staring at each other-all i know is
that i felt numb and sick and para-
lyzed all over the same as i did the
day i got hold of the wrong bottle
down in the drug room

  then little by little the glare died
out of his eyes till at last he set the
jar down and smiled

  heres your rubber gloves i
said kind of shakily and turned to
go

  wait a minute he said in his
kindly soft voice just as if nothing
had happened

  i stopped the gray vapor in the
jar seemed to be restless moving  

  you saw everything he asked

  i nodded

  he smiled the same sad way he
does when he says   too late boys  

  sit down he said i want to
talk to you

  i sat down

  i get all the bad cases in here
he began and i do all i can for
them i work mighty hard to keep
them from dying and i often do it
dont i

  again i nodded

  and listen he said leaning to-
ward me if i cant save their bod-
ies i-save their souls

  seeing the look on my face he
arose and led me to a tall black cabi-


weird

tales

net in one corner of the room lift-
ing out a dummy shelf of books he
pointed with pride at row after row
of glass jars all filled with a thick
grayish vapor

  the instant he uncovered those
things i nearly keeled over its a
hard thing to explain but ill try to
do it before i got this job i
worked behind the scenes in a big
theater sometimes when the stage
was dark id slip out to fix a set for
the next scene and from the very
first i noticed a queer sensation
caused by suddenly stepping into the
gaze of so many eyes i could feel
the eyes of the audience out there in
the dark even though i couldnt see
them and so it was with the jars
in old johns cabinet-i immediate-
ly felt that i was the target for a
great many eyes there was nothing
i could see except those little jars
full of something gaseous and gray
but-

  old john closed the cabinet and it
was the same as stepping off the dark
stage the feeling of eyes was gone

    i may need an assistant some
time he began again and since
my secret had to be found out im
glad it was you and not one of those
know-it-all young interns i can
depend on you to keep still about this
cant i

  there was nothing for me to do but
say yes suddenly the ambulance
siren screamed in the distance then
screamed again coming closer

  another case he breathed
here-get behind this screen until
after they have gone  	v

  i hid and in a few moments the
ambulance boys had brought in an-
other limp sprawling bundle and
turned it over to old john as they
carried the other one out i heard him
say his customary too late boys
and add something about this ones
going to take a lot of time after
he had locked the door i came out of
hiding

  he motioned me to be still so i
stood quietly and watched him

  the case on the operating table
was a big beefy middle-aged man
his throat and shoulders horribly
crushed and bloody i marveled at
old johns magic rubber-gloved
fingers as they twinkled over the
mangled area he bent forward
quivering in his intensity of pur-
pose snatching up or flinging down
an instrument like lightning probing
here or with a fairylike lightness of
touch tying up a severed artery
truly old john needed no assistant
presently after a most painstaking
final examination he stood back and
sighed shaking his head sorrowfully
i saw his lips silently form the words
too late boys then suddenly
another light came into his eyes a
different expression gripped his face
the transformation somehow remind-
ed me of a story i had read about a
collie dog that tenderly guarded a
flock of sheep by day only to slip
out and murder them by night

  old john took the big net from its
place of concealment he motioned
for me to help him and together we
lifted the dying man and laid him on
a long pair of hospital scales as old
john felt his pulse he pointed at the
register hand which stood at 
pounds and  ounces he made ready
his soul-trapping apparatus and held
the net close over the body in a
moment that indescribable yet def-
inite change took place which marks
the death of an unconscious person
old john directed my eyes to the
scale hand and i watched carefully
the hand held its mark steadily
then precisely as the delicate web be-
fore me began to flutter the hand
quickly dropped back four ounces

  i sat dumbly as old john com-
pleted the capture of the soul and
stowed the jar away with the others
i had heard-had even read in the
sunday supplements-that the
weight of a body decreases sharply at
soul-catcher



death but never had i expected to
have it proved to me in such an awful
manner i became dimly conscious
that old john was speaking

  you see there is something def-
inite which escapes from the body at
death that something i have in my
jars ha ha but the weight of the
something is quickly replaced by air
exactly on the same principal as
when you submerge an uncorked bot-
tle in water-the air bubbles out and
the water rushes in    look at the
hand

  i looked and saw that the body
had regained the lost four ounces the
four ounces of gray nebulosity now
imprisoned in the glass jar   

  later as i fled unsteadily down the
corridor i heard old john announc-
ing sadly that it was too late boys

vtext day i came upon old john

   stretched on a couch in his room
oblivious of everything i shook him
gently but as he did not wake i left
him to sleep on

  an hour afterward he called me in
shut the door and went to some
lengths explaining that he had been
astralizing himself the whole
story didnt sound very plausible to
me this thing of leaving your body
for a jaunt in spirit form still i
told myself if anyone should know
about that kind of things it would
be old john

  to a rough practical mind like my
own this astralizing process would
seem more realistic and believable if
a hypodermic syringe and a bottle of
morphine went with it but even so
-theres nothing left on earth thats
ungodly and spooky enough to sur-
prize me any more   

vxhen they told me old john was

  	 dead i was almost afraid to go
and look at him but i went

  he hadnt been dead very long-
hadnt been disturbed he was

stretched out on his old couch the
same as if he were astralizing him-
self but what made my knees start
to give in like soft rubber was the
sight of the janitor before the tall
black cabinet sweeping up the frag-
ments of a great many small glass
jars

  wha-what happened there i
asked one of the nurses weakly

  why when the elevator motor
tore loose up in the attic it shook the
whole building broke several vases
in my ward and it must have jarred
those glasses out of that rickety old
cabinet what on earth old john
was saving them for beats me

  i had been away from the hospital
all day the more i looked at those
broken jars the queerer i felt pretty
soon i stepped over to see old john
the m ds had his face covered up
and were arguing loudly about apo-
plexy i pulled the cloth down and
looked at him

  ugh ill never forget it it was
awful he looked as if-oh i cant
half describe it-looked as if he had
been torn to pieces from the inside
just as a light sack would break if
there were a dozen big cats all trying
to get out in different directions oh
his body was all together it wasnt
mangled but-well you could see
that as the way he had died

  it took me quite a while to figure
it out but when i had believe me i
didnt feel any better i guess it
must have happened like this

  old john had astralized himself and
his body was lying there without any
astral or soul or spirit or whatever
you want to call it this must leave
a sort of empty space as near as i
can understand then when all
those jars full of captured souls or
astrals were broken and released
those things inside then they-i
guess youd say they-saw old
johns body lying there empty-and
they must have had it in for him

keeping them canned up like that-
maybe they all saw it was a chance

to get a body and live again

they must have all crowded inside
and taken possession of his body at
once    wonder what his astral
did

maybe they fought   

  anyhow they couldnt all occupy
one body and so   

  this thought is driving me crazy
the ambulance boys say im get-

     by miles j breuer

     i dwell alone behind the stone

     in the shadows grisly gloom

     my watch i keep when flesh-folk sleep
     before grohrishous tomb

    at dank midnight in sulfur light
    my pallid shape i show

     and those that see in terror flee

     nor ever respite know

     i glide among the staring throng
     of gravestones in the dark

     for here i reign tis my domain

    this ghoulish dead mens park

    and in the rooms of ghastly tombs
    i rattle dead mens bones

     my shrieking laughs neath epitaphs
     are heard mid sighs and groans

     in every storm i show my form

     the timids  blood to freeze

     i haunt their halls their mined walls

     i leer from out the trees

     i live alone behind the stone

     whose gray top reeks with gore

    each thing that runs my presence shuns-
    alone forevermore
over the face of the earth it
was night and in the soul of
lenore andless it was night
but between the two nights there
was a difference the night that cov-
ered the earth was cool and dim
rippled with the intermittent songs
of solitary birds chased in a thou-
sand lines of beaten silver by a
great moon the night in the
soul of lenore andless was hard
black and hot with agony there were
no liquid sallies of melody from
feathered throats to pierce the ter-
rible silence there was no moon

  she raised her drooped head to
stare wordlessly into the face of the
man who sat dumbly before her then
closed her eyes in a convulsive at-
tempt to restrain futile tears but the
tears forced their way through her
tight-shut lids and plashed upon her
folded hands

 lenore-im sorry what an
asinine weak comfortless word-sor-
ry id give anything on earth if it
wasnt like this its the wildest
thing that ever happened on the crazy
globe i like you better than any

turned away his eyes

  he rose to his feet and strode
hastily to the window where he stood

weird tales

 peace they two had been drawn to-
 gether by some involuntary attraction
 that held them as helpless as twigs
 drifting toward a whirlpool he

	knew she had loved him instantly
 but he had found himself unable to
 love in return

    instead of love he had swiftly be-
  come prey to emotions urges and im-
  pulses that gripped him dismayed
  him frightened him till he felt him-
  self shaken to the depths he didnt
  flatter himself that he had ever been
  any parlor saint he was no different
  from any other man of strong pas-
  sions ambitions and ideals but the
  thing that had driven him since he
  first met lenore andless angered
  stung and shamed him

   he knew he had hurt her to the
 quick battered her sensitive spirit
 under the hammer-blows of hard in-
 voluntary words he had hated the
 words as he said them and hated
 himself for being forced to speak
 them yet he had been powerless to
 stay them he had hard work stay-
 ing his hands he was conscious of
 the fact that he had wanted to hurt
 her wanted to hurt her now there
 had been times when he fought a
 wild desire to break her bones with
 his powerful fingers breaking her
 heart with his denial of love was not
 enough and again he had raged to
 beat her to flog her with a cutting
 thong to tear her flesh and see the
 crimson blood drip from her wounds
 the manhood of which he had been
 not a little proud revolted at the hor-
 ror which held him in a vise he had
 determined he would conquer it and
 found himself helpless

   then he had tried to break loose
 from her to get away and stay away
 and he had found that effort as use-
 less as the other he was bound to
 her bound by something more strong
 more determined more enduring
 than he weirdly insensibly he felt
 that it emanated from her possibly
 without her knowledge possibly with-

 out possessing the slightest inti-
 mation of it she held him only she
 could release him and even if she
 realized it he felt sure that she
 loved him too desperately to let him
 go he remained bound helpless as
 a man trussed hand and foot and
 as he remained gradually but with
 ghastly certainty the wild ungodly
 impulses were riding him to a fall
 he had come within the aura of the
 final foe-fear

  he feared for what was happening
to him he feared for his own san-
ity he was  longer antony roe
he was some unholy fiend swayed
and tortured by the drive of some
nameless terror that threatened to
batter down his resistance and make
of him that hideous anomaly-a male
human that is less than a man he
wondered if she too had come under
the influence of those wild currents
he had withheld from her as a mat-
ter of course the feral thoughts that
raced through his brain he knew
she had found him increasingly si-
lent he had caught her watching
him when he dared not speak for fear
of what he might say he knew she
had seen him clench his hands and
walk away from her intuition must
tell her that he was in an agony of
mind to be gone from her vicinity-
yet she held him and would not let
him go

  tony-whats the matter with
us he felt her gaze on his back
but he did not move her voice
rasped on raw strings down deep in-
side of him somewhere this is a
wild abnormal situation what are
we working out whats got us
why cant we beat it off

 beat-that word beat roe
wheeled from the window and walked
toward her his face white his eyes
half maniacal 

  i dont know whats got us le-
nore but by god something has

god ruling this universe ruling

were only so many little ants

and kill a few other ants what does
any god care that much less work
for him-so many less ants for him
to bother about so many-

 tony lenore sprang to her
feet and backed away from him
thrusting out her hands as though to
ward oft his words tony-we re
mad

 yes-were mad roe shook
from head to foot as he caught him-
self into control with racking effort
i am at least thats the only ex-
planation and i am going now be-
fore i do something that will haunt
me to suicide

    tony   lenore held out a plead-
ing hand tony-it may be for-
ever

  roe caught her hand in both of his
and stood staring at her like a man
straining his eyes through impen-
etrable blackness in one split sec-
ond he knew what life might have
meant could he love this woman as
she loved him-and knew he could
not with a smothered oath he
dropped her hand pushed her from
him and rushed out the door

cor three hours after lenore and-
less knew pain there are no
words with which to designate what
type of pain nor to describe the
pitch of agony through which she
passed before she finally threw her-
self exhausted on her bed exhaust-
ed by the travail itself exhausted
by her wild effort to burst from the
chaos into a glimmer of understand-
ing she stilled her mind and delib-
erately tried to imagine the world-
her world-without antony roe

  hers was an intense nature to
her a thousand little things were
conduit for delight or pain that to
others were less than conduit for a
slight smile or a trivial annoyance
to a hundred others what was the
passing in and out the casual asso-
ciation of antony roe the sound
of his voice-and her pulse leaped
the step of his foot on the stair-
and the air sang the touch of his
hand-and the world lived he had
left a little heap of cigarette ash on
the shining mahogany table-top she
would have frowned at the act in an-
other but it was antony who had
done it this time she swept the ash-
es off into her palm with an indulgent
smile and tossed them out the tall
window to the breeze where his
shoulder had leaned against the wall
her hand lingered a moment as she
passed the world was no world
without antony roe there was no
giving him up hold him she must
or living were a silly farce

  she drifted to sleep she never
knew when it was a deep sleep and
with its first wings brushing her
weary eyes she slipped into a mighty
poignant unearthly dream she
found herself in a strange country
of fiat rolling fields checkered with
groves in which great buildings
reared mountain-high into the ether
as though drawn by some invisible
irresistible power she turned auto-
matically toward one massive struc-
ture standing in a towering grove of
eucalypts the pungent odor of the
spicy buds filled the air as she drew
nearer as she approached the build-
ing itself she saw that the high
entrance door was standing open she
walked up to it and stepped within

 she found herself in a mighty
domed room and the roof was arch-
ing and blue and dim-like the sky
and the walls were shimmering and
incorporeal-like banked clouds
then her eyes strayed down the room
at the far end of which she saw a


weird

tales

great exquisitely earven alabaster
ihrone upon the throne sat a man
watching her evidently awaiting her
coming still drawn by that in-
visible force she walked onward till
she stood before him and looked up
into his face

  it was like no face she had ever
visioned it might have been carven
iiom the same alabaster as the
ihrone it was so purely flawless so
unearthly in beauty the wide un-
winking eyes as deep as all mystery
and as compassionate as a childs
dream of god were the oolor of a
priceless sapphire in a pool in the
shade the silk-spun hair rippling
to his shoulders was the shade of a
ripe corn-tassel in the sun his gar-
ment was as delicately toned as the
new leaves on an apple tree in spring
and all about him there was a shim-
mering gleaming golden glow even
his alabaster skin shone with the
molten light as though that light
came from within

  he spoke all those who have
reached the pinnacle of pain turn to
me i too was crucified   his
voice startled her it was cool liquid
deep like the sound of a great bell
under fathoms of water we reach
the pinnacle of pain by one road-
the road of karma the golden
light played over his face as he re-
peated karma

  but what is karma the girl
drew back as though a chill wind had
blown across her forehead

    the great law of readjustment
no more-no less the voice of the
shining one was like the tone of a
pipe in the wind men come to
earth young souls untried unproved
bom equal in the beginning each
infant soul is given its share of
strength faith love and hope ev-
ery thought every dream every emo-
tion man knows as he passes through
life sends forth a thread of vibrating
energy as each thread spins out
each man weaves his pattern of love

or hate mercy or vengeance anger or
pity passion or pain and he weaves
also his future lives and his ultimate
destiny he eomcs back to earth
again and again-with each life ac-
cruing something of attainment or
failure something of nobility or
grossness and death comes and the
body rots and the soul goes into the
higher planes to review the past life
to segregate the best from the experi-
ences to weigh the weakness and fol-
ly to count the mistakes and heed the
lessons learned then he is born
again upon the earth picks up the
old trails and begins again every
debt of act and deed must be paid
over in double coin and so it goes
from life to life till the score is paid
and that-is karma

  but listen the shining one
bent toward her and his voice was as
little silver chimes in a deep well
there are times when through
some act of folly or cruelty in an-
other life the human finds things be-
come too heavy for his souls grace
and he may break i grieve to see
men break i would that they should
see and trust and fight through so
much is lost when humans break
the voice of the shining one was
like the wail of a cello in the night in
the rain but see evolution elim-
inates waste you were near to break-
ing  called you here that you might
find faith and strength faith in the
hour of misunderstanding mercy
have you forgotten who died-for
mercy   

 mercy what wild dream was
this even in her sleep lenoue re-
membered that tony had cried out
for mercy

    there-see there is the curtain
of memory   the shining one point-
ed to the far side of the room at the
left and lenore turned her head
across the wide space of the ala-
baster wall hung a great curtain of
silver tissue look back two thou-
sand years and remember the
the greatest gift



voice of the shining one was like a
temple bell on the top of a mountain

      the silver curtain shifting
shadows began to appear assume
form and color then before the
girls eyes grew a scene so like to life
that the silver curtain faded and
nothing was there but a wide flat
river flowing sluggishly between
sandy banks down the river straight
toward her came a huge barge it
was decked in all the panoply of a
royal house shaded by striped awn-
ings propelled by thirty oars rising
and falling rhythmically as one each
oar wielded by a slave chained in the
galley to his bench

  on the silk-strewn and cushion-
matted deck stood several women
waving fans arranging pillows striv-
ing constantly to insure the comfort
of the young queen lolling indolently
among them as the barge came
within the foreground the young
queen pointed to a spot on the sandy
bank

  we shall pause there to rest i
hunger   her voice came faintly as
from a great distance yet clearly so
that lenore heard every word

  one of the serving women spoke
sharply to a great black slave stand-
ing in thebow of the barge he
wheeled to call an order to the thirty
white slaves at the oars the nose of
the barge swung slowly the pace of
the boat slackened the young queen
rose among her cushions and the
barge touched the bank the huge
negro called to three others and be-
tween them the four blacks raised a
wide gangplank and carried it across
to the low flat side of the boat where
entrance and exit was made they
laid the plank from barge to bank
and stepped back two on either side
arms folded across ebony chests

  the women lifted the young queen
to her feet filling their arms with
silks and cushions to make for her a
bed of ease on the sand and waited

her bidding she paused a moment
swaying gracefully on her slender
sandaled feet she yawned idly one
pink palm over her mouth then she
walked slowly toward the gangplank
her women proceeding and following
her

  the slaves in the galley bowed
their heads that they might not see
her face as she passed near the
cut-in exit-way one white slave sat so
near holding aloft his oar head up-
on his breast that he could have
reached out and touched her as she
passed for an instant his eyes
flashed up at her and in them was
the look of a man who had wor-
shiped the sun hopelessly from
afar then he dropped his gaze
none had seen the look in the lap
of the meandering current the barge
lurched the young queen swayed
and stumbled her foot missed the
velvet carpet spread for her and she
caught at the galley stanchion to
steady herself the white slave
winced and caught his breath but he
did not move the young queen
caught her balance replaced her foot
upon the velvet carpet and started to
pass on

  but the eyes of the white slave had
followed her foot as it stumbled and
where she stepped he saw that she
had left the print of her sandaled
foot in the dust at the edge of the
galley stall his body shook he
leaned swiftly and kissed the print
of her heel but as he did so the
stanchion dug harshly into his side
and he caught his breath in a low
exclamation of pain the young
queen turned as swiftly as he had
bent just in time to grasp the tiling
he had done-to witness the lips of a
galley slave caressing the print of her
foot in the dust her face went hard
with anger she drew herself to her
slender height turned to the slavo
nearest her and commanded

  the scourge


weird tales

  over the barge settled a silence a
void of shocked suspense scarcely
breathing the other slaves held their
faces low and the women stared in
horror at the man who had dared to
kiss the footprint of a queen the
negro to whom the queen had spoken
crossed the deck to return with a
long knotted whip in his powerful
hands the young queen pointed to
the offender commanding sharply
twenty lashes twenty stripes
across the back

  the huge negro braced himself the
muscles of his arms bulged the knot-
ted thong swung high in the air and
as it whistled downward stinging
across the bare back of the galley
slave it cut the white flesh like a
dull knife leaving a crimson stripe
in its wake again it rose and fell
and again and yet again the young
queen stood watching coolly count-
ing the slow brutal slashes and her
eyes were contemptuous and her face
was cold and her red lips moved as
though she were savoring something
sweet to the taste

  when she had counted twenty the
white slave was unconscious in his
chains his back one blood-sodden
lacerated wound and the ugly thong
dripped crimson drops into the print
of the sandal in the dust the young
queen issued a low command the
negro stooped roughly seized the
beaten mans chin in his hand and
raised the fallen head that all might
witness the humiliation of one who
had dared kiss the footprint of a
queen then there was visible for the
first time the face of the flogged
white slave

  tony lenore cried wincing in
sharp pain the young queen turned
starting as though she had heard ancl
lenore andless looked straight into
her own features no the girl
shivered grasping at the arm of the
shining one no i never did that
to antony

  two thousand years ago he an-

swered her as the picture faded
leaving only the alabaster wall and a
singing silence and being the
first cruelty it is the last to be paid-
after the way of humans and be-
ing the cruelty of pride it was wan-
ton why will a soul be proud
why will even a fool be proud-when
god is not the voice of the shin-
ing one was like the sighing of a
harp-string in an utter void from
conquered pride comes humility
out of pain is bom compassion
there is no royal road to peace-but
only a stony path of the pilgrims
progress and atonement when we
have crossed the hills of pain when
we have returned to life in love all
we took from it in selfish greed when
we have traversed the pit of dark-
ness to find faith and come out un-
afraid when we have laid upon the
altar of renunciation the greatest
gift-the score is paid and what
for you is the greatest gift the
ultimate the all the most you
have to offer life the shining
ones face was a pitying mask mold-
ed out of the sorrow of all the world

 antony lenore shrank back-
ward whispering the word starkly
antony take everything else-but
dont ask me to give up antony

  i ask nothing i may not ask
the voice of the shining one was
like the thin picked notes of a mellow
mandolin you must do as you
will but in only one way lies peace
two thousand years ago you took
from him love and the homage of his
spirit-took it contemptuously as the
due mead of your royal station and
when it broke its bounds that others
might see-you gave in return hu-
miliation and pain is not the one
course for you obvious his chal-
lenging voice was like a trumpet
sounding the last rally

 lord-forgive lenore raised
her hands in supplication but her cry
was only a whisper in all spaee
the greatest gift



  from  those whom we have
wronged must we ask forgiveness
the voice of the shining one was
like the reed of a mighty organ roll-
ing down through the corridors of
time   to those from whom we
have taken must we make return
two thousand years ago he was
chained he is still chained the
way is clear go in peace the
light that radiated from the shining
one grew to such blinding intensity
that she cried out and hid her face

nphen lenore andless suddenly
awoke in her bed and knew
nothing of how she got there she
rose turned on the light and paced
the floor recalling in detail her wild
strange dream was it a dream
something hovered over her close
like the thin threads of memory
reaching back into dead ages and she
felt the warm sun on her bare
shoulders the sway of a barge under
her feet it was no dream-the way
was clear she shivered in agony at
the thought of seeing antony roe
pass from her yet in the resolve of
renunciation and restitution came the
steady calm of peace

  all through the rest of the night
she paced the floor readjusting her
balance growing used to the barren
plane of life without antony roe
and when morning came and the
dawn broke in her window she went
and stood with her face to the light
and knew that she had the strength
to set him free strange now to
think she had ever been so narrow-
souled as to want to hold him chained
when he was in torment to go she
sighed a little sigh of relief the sigh
of one grateful for the close of a ter-
rible battle went to the telephone on
the wall and called him

  stiained and groping his voice came
over the wire yes lenore
what is it  

  i want you to come here-for the
last time i have one thing to say to

you-and then i shall not ever see
you again can you come immedi-
ately

  immediately

  the telephone clicked in her ear
and she hung the receiver back in
place turned and walked into the
other room where they had so often
sat and talked how to tell him
what to tell him dare she simply
say that she had come to the con-
clusion that they were of more
trouble to each other than they were
pleasure and he had best go his way
she caught herself smiling grimly
the eternal female seeking to send
him away from her baffled hurt ob-
viously to himself the offender-to
save her face and leave her right of
woman-pride unmarred pride-
pride mocking futile-fighting the
ignominious defeat of crying i was
wrong forgive

  one way the shining one had
said one way one way to pass to
extend the greatest gift out of
conquered pride-she began pacing
the floor setting her teeth on the
flame of hot shame for the last hold
of littleness then she heard his rap
on the door heard the door open
heard his step across the hall heavily
ascending the stairs saw him throw
open the door and come toward her
she stopped and stood very still
barely three feet from her he halted
peering into her face in her eyes
there was an unearthly light he
did not know it but it was the light
of supreme sacrifice something in
her face startled him

 antony-you are free her
words startled him yet even as they
reached his ears he knew that he was
free i shall not hold you any
more i did not know i was holding
you go wherever you will-across
the world-to the farthest planet
nothing matters save that you find
peace but before you go look back
antony-look bach two thousand
years-and forgive


weird tales

  roe did not move his mind shook
under her words steadied careened
upward searching through the fog of
time something began to sing in his
ears like the humming sound of great
wheels spinning in space he felt
like a man in a dream strange feel-
ings and thoughts bore down on him
remember what what was that
upon his ankle  a chain what was
that falling from his hands  an oar
what was that whistling through the
air a bloody thong what was that
burning biting tearing his flesh  a
knotted rope what was that she had
said twenty stripes across the
back

  he swayed on his feet staring at
the carpeted floor but he saw no
carpet and no twining design his
starting eyes saw only dust-dust-
and the print of a sandaled foot

  antony-cant you forgive
what was it she had said
nothing mattered but that he find
peace compassion for his cruelty
now humility for her own cruelty
then renunciation of the love that
had meant better than life sacrifice
seeking to bestow the greatest gift in
atonement

  roe lifted his head staring into her
face his hands clenched at his sides
the sting of the lash across tortured
flesh passed and suddenly strife and
terror were gone and nothing re-
mained but a strange sense of having
at last attained what he had hungered
for two thousand years one step
and she was in his arms his voice
was crying incoherently in her ears
my queen there is nothing to
forgive-i love you

eyes of flame and a heart of hell

voice like the toll of a funeral bell

thews of steel and velvet paws

rapier fangs and dagger claws

a soul  the ravished soul of a man

bound by the arts of the devil clan

seared and chained by blood and lust

its draggled wings trailed in the dust

a howling thing neath prison bars

choked in the shadow of the stars
wallowing in the crimson feast

befouled by the fetid stench of the beast

in the pier-glass he looked into the
sneering cynical vice-impressed face
of his brother

tiie house was an ancient
rambling affair set well back
from the road and hidden
from the view of the casual passer-
by by a tall and moldering brick
wall overrun- with dank vines and
covered on the shady sides with a
patina of moss and obscene lichens
that seemed to emit a sickly musty
odor of decay

  the beautiful lawn that had at one
time been the pride of some garden-
ers heart was now a rank and gro-
tesque jungle of noxious weeds what
had once been a beautiful white-
pebbled drive but was now little
more than a weed-grown path swung
through the grounds in a sweeping
graceful curve to the porte-cochere
and hence to the cupolaed stable
which was now but a vine-covered
shell of decay that hesitated on the
very brink of utter ruin

  but it was the occupant of the
ancient eountry estate rather than
the place itself that interested me
most in my strolls along the lonely
road that led by the place i not in-
frequently saw him walking moodily
along the grassy and desolate drive
or sitting in solitary and contempla-
tive grandeur on the great circular
porch now warped and wavering
that nearly encircled the massive
rambling pile

  once as i had passed he had been
standing close to the rusted grilled
iron gates that sagged from two
weary pillars guarding the entrance
to the grounds and i was struck
most exceedingly with the power oi
the old mans personality

  his skin was rather dark and his
face in shape was reminiscent ot
some portraits of shakespeare wide
across the forehead which bulged

                                   


weird tales

slightly tapering down to a long and
extremely pointed chin the eyes
were set deeply in their sockets and
were cold and piercing blue his
mouth was large and thin of lip and
he seemed to smile a continuous and
sardonic smile that had nothing of
mirth and very little of humanity in
it it was like the smile one sees on
masks carvedimpersonal sneering

  he studied me as i approached re-
turned my salutation civilly enough
and rather to my surprize made some
comment on the weather willing
indeed to chat with my mysterious
neighbor i stopped and we con-
versed idly for several minutes

  it was evident instantly that he
was well bred and well educated and
his voice while possessed of a pecu-
liarly dry and unmusical quality
held the subtle inflection that is a
characteristic of the voice of those
who speak with authority

  since we are nearly neighbors
then he concluded our chat you
must drop in and see me some even-
ing you must be lonesome up there
in your big house-and he nodded
toward my country place the roofs
of which were just barely visible in
the distance as they glimmered in the
level rays of the downing sun-and
i am sure it is very lonely here i
shall look forward to a visit sir

  that was the beginning of the odd
friendship that for several months
existed between joseph morton and
myself i found that he lived utterly
alone using but three or four of the
many rooms in the monstrous old
house doing his own cooking and
housekeeping and doing it with a
meticulous and painstaking niceness
that bespoke years of bachelor ex-
perience

  i could never induce him to allow
me to play the host so far as i know
he never left the grounds of his
ancient and festering estate

  i am here for a reason clarke
he would say when i pressed him to

allow me to return his many cour-
tesies   it gives me pleasure to have
you here and i trust that pleasure is
reciprocated some day i may tell
you more for the present i know
you will excuse me if i decline  

  there was a constant air of mys-
tery about the man his almost re-
volting appearance was so utterly at
variance with the splendid breadth
and beauty of his words and
thoughts

  he would gaze at me with his hard
almost malignant eyes his lips curl-
ing in that eternal sneering smile
and give voice to the most splendid of
sentiments we discussed art history
and literature but never in their
modem aspects he seemed to know
nothing of the living artists and
writers and nothing of modern his-
tory or politics religion a prolific
subject for discussion always in such
talks as ours morton invariably side-
stepped and once when i deliberately
put a question to him on this subject
in such a way that he could not avoid
an answer he said merely you will
have to pardon me if i do not discuss
that   and passed smoothly on to
some other subject

  i was sorry i could not inveigle
the old man into an argument on the
subject of religion for it is one in
which i have been long interested
finally in order to see if i could not
in some way open up such a discus-
sion i one evening voiced the senti-
ment that i was an utter atheist be-
lieving in neither god nor devil
heaven nor hell

  when youre dead youre dead
and theres an end to it i stated
flatly

  i had rather expected my host to
take instant exception to my state-
ment instead he merely studied me
carefully his lids half closed and in
his hard and oddly baleful eyes a
thoughtful light as though he
weighed a momentous problem in his
mind
guarded



  what time is it he asked ab-
ruptly

 i looked at my watch three
after  i said

  i thought it was later than that
i am glad it isnt for i want to tell
you a story clarke a long story
that i think will interest you who
believe that after life there are the
worms-and nothing more a true
story too clarke

the old man leaned back comfort-
ably as though tired in his
chair his head rested against the
faded worn velvet back and his eyes
were closed almost as though he
slept

  once upon a time as all stories
begin there were two brothers let
us call them george and harry
george was the older a serious
studious rather silent lad the exact
opposite of his brother harry even
as a child took an inhuman delight
in torturing his pets and in perform-
ing various small acts of vandalism
he grew up into a licentious cruel
roistering bully of a man who even
in his teens had a reputation such as
few men would care to bear

  the mother of the two boys had
died in giving birth to harry and
on her death-bed the mother had giv-
en the baby in charge of george al-
though at the time he was only a lad
himself barely old enough to remem-
ber the father was but the mold
in which harrys evil personality had
been cast that he died a few years
later was but a blessing

 harry was constantly on the
mind of the older brother the dy-
ing mothers charge rested heavily on
the lads studious shoulders but
despite all he could say or do his
evil-living drunken brother went
hell-bent on his way it almost drove
george insane but his every effort
proved fruitless

    george was twenty-seven and

harry nineteen when the older
brother coming down-stairs one night
in the dark in search of a forgotten
book slipped and crashed to the bot-
tom of the polished oaken stairs
they found him the next morning
his head bent back under his body-
dead

  that is the body was dead
george himself was not dead he felt
the crashing impact of his body on
the stairs felt a flaming wave sear
his body as he struck the floor below
for an instant his brain seemed
bathed in a flashing kaleidoscopic
flood of colors new colors out of the
eyes range of sensitivity odd weird
colors that blazed with unearthly
and terrifying beauty then he- 

  but my dear morton i inter-
rupted you speak of things of
which you can not know you ex-
pect me to believe all this

  he opened his eyes but did not
move his head

  let me finish my little story
clarke then you can decide for your-
self he said evenly surely you
find the tale interesting

  i nodded something in the blazing
intentness of the mans eyes subdu-
ing the mocking jeering words that
were just behind my lips go on
please i said ill not interrupt
again

  then he rose from the floor and
impelled by some strange instinct
looked down at his feet he stood
looking down at his own still figure
on the floor

  it took him some seconds to real-
ize the truth and then it came in a
flash that sent him reeling back into
the shadows of the room he ivas
dead

    the death that was his i shall not
speak of it is not well to prema-
turely prepare those who must fol-
low in the way of all flesh it is a
journey one best takes without charts
or guides for no man travels the
same trail


weird tales

  george remained there in his
home in life he had worried con-
tinually about his brother and his
wild dissolute ways and this same
solicitude seemed to tie him to harry
even after he had passed out of this
world

  for a long time george could
discover no way to help he saw his
father die a few months after his
own death but strange as it may
seem he never saw him after he
passed over harry coming into
possession of the family estate went
rapidly from bad to worse on sev-
eral occasions he nearly killed com-
panions with whom he went fighting
for harry in those days had the
strength of an ox and a fiery and
evil temper that rode him haglike

  george had learned thatthe sins
of the earth are punished when the
earthly body is discarded and he
knew his brother harry was jeopard-
izing his very soul some day he
would commit murder the unforgiv-
able sin and then- knowing

what he knew things too horrible
to pour into human ears he tried
frantically to find some way to check
the mad and evil activity of his
brother and at last he found a
way

    one night as harry was sleeping
george concentrated all the power
that was in him on an idea that he
wished to penetrate harrys con-
sciousness he had read something
of thought transference the power
of suggestion and other kindred sub-
jects and he was trying in a crude
way to put his meager knowledge to
a good purpose

  instead of doing what he had in-
tended he found himself drawn
somehow to the sleeping figure of his
brother he never knew just what
force guided him in his actions he
came close to the restless tossing fig-
ure on the bed bent over it some-
thing seemed to be pressing from
above he felt strangely heavy and a

smothery feeling overcame him he
seemed engaged in a sort of night-
mare struggle with somebody or
something that he could not see nor
feel and then he seemed to sink in-
to a warm and yielding blackness

  for a moment he rested and then
he opened his eyes he found him-
self gazing up at the ceiling barely
discernible in the faint gray light
that was filtering in from the east
windows of the room

    startled he leaped up he struck
the floor with a resounding thud of
bare feet and gazed around wildly
down at his body his hands his feet
he rushed to a great pier-glass that
stood at one end of the room and
peered eagerly into its shining
depths out at him stared not the
nothingness that would have greeted
him a few minutes before not the
pale and ascetic features of his own
earthly body but the sneering cyn-
ical vice-impressed face of his broth-
er somehow he had driven out the
vital part of harrys own person-
ality and supplanted it with his own
he had switched souls

  for months george held posses-
sion of his brothers body the
change was the wonder of all who
knew him the servants grew afraid
of him they thought he must be
crazed his boon companions
neglected now sought him and grew
angry when he-or george as you
choose-would have none of them

  george was conscious at times
of an intangible outside influence
beating in the air around him as a
bat flutters at the shutters of a closed
window but he was resolved that
his brothers evil personality should
never again invade his body george
would shut out his brothers wicked
soul and leave it disembodied so that
it could harm no one no longer foul
the family name and at last might
pass to the testing without at least
the black spot of murder upon it
guarded



tut george figured without the
evil forces of the world that
surrounds us here on earth invisible
and intangible yet powerful and very
real he awoke one night in the
midst of a terrible and ghastly night-
mare gasping for breath and with a
deathly chill creeping over him he
knew what was happening and he
fought with all the energy that was
in him but it was useless there was
a sensation of sudden expansion of
great cold and he was beside the bed
looking down at his brother harry
was sitting up looking wildly about
the room and the house rang with
his shoutings and cursings he
knew what had happened and he was
afraid

  i will not weary you nor tax
your belief by telling you the strug-
gle that george waged suffice to
say that at last he won out he could
enter the body of his brother at will
all save the body became george not
harry

    there was only one thing that he
found had to be considered he could
not remain in permanent possession
of the body if he tried to his own
ego worn down by the cares of the
body grew weak while the ego of his
brother waxing angry and powerful
in the outer darkness could come in
for a time and drive george out for
a few hours until he had regained
his strength

  he got into the habit therefore
of relinquishing his hold on this poor
body every night at  oclock turn-
ing it over to his brothers own ego
until the dawn it was safe to do
so because when he was outside his
body harry was in utter darkness
and he was horribly afraid of dark-
ness when in the body he slept only
in a brilliantly lighted room and
since george flouted harrys friends
during the daylight hours they nev-
er sought him out at night and he
dared not brave the black night to
go to them george dismissed all the

servants so that harry could not
wreak his vengeance upon them and
so while harrys evil and malignant
soul for a few hours every night held
full possession of his own gross body
he could do none of the evil that was
in his mind

  and so it was clarke that a
dead man kept the pledge he had
made his dying mother yet you
say that after this life there is
naught but the worms 

  there was a ring of sincerity a
deep undertone of conviction in my
hosts voice that could not be
ignored yet the weird and impossible
story he had related failed to make
an impression on me it simply
transcended belief

  your story is interesting my dear
morton but you could hardly expect
me to accept it as proof of your own
ideas regarding life after death i
shrugged smilingly it is too far-
fetched it deals with material you
could not by any chance know

about it-

  my host leaped from his chair his
eyes blazing

  you fool he shouted and his
dry harsh voice rang like the screech
of a carrion bird you utter fool
the real names were not george and
harry but thaddeus and joseph-
and the last name was morton this
evil body you see before you is that
of joseph morton but the mind that

directs it is that of-

  he stopped short as the mellow
voice of a church bell in the distant
village came stealing through the air
the blood drained suddenly from his
face and he made a quick gesture of
despair

  god your watch was slow
clarke its midnight go go man
before it is too late it is his hour
and i can not resist him oh you

fool go cant you see-

  his voice died in a harsh rattle
and he swayed staring at me with
glassy lifeless eyes


weird tales

  terror-stricken i had leaped
away from my crazed host but seeing
his present condition i paused for
an instant would to god i had
gone and never seen what next greet-
ed my eyes

 a sudden and horrible change
came over the mans face it was as
though all the evil lineaments of his
features were subtly deepened ac-
cented made more hellishly repulsive
his glassy eyes lit up with the light
of an accursed intelligence and his
voice raised but an instant before in
desperate warning now sank to a
throaty murmur

  my dear clarke he said fawn-
ingly i am sorry i startled you so
it is a-a little weakness of mine this
fear of midnight he chuckled
evilly and came slowly closer to me
his eyes alight with a hungry and
menacing gleam that caused me to
shrink from him speechless with sur-
prize and fright

  i had the distinct impression that
this was not the man i knew at all
he wore the same clothes had the
same face and figure and the transi-
tion if transition there had been had
occurred before my very eyes yet i
could not force my senses to accept
this gloating leering figure as the
kindly old man who had four or five
hours ago so courteously bidden me
welcome

  itly god could it be possible that
the story was true  it was unbeliev-
able but-god he was coming
closer his arms dangling like a goril-
las and his bestial head thrust for-
ward ominously and for the
instant my nerveless legs refused to
obey my commands

  sit down what are you afraid
of he commanded gruffly

  instead of doing as he ordered i
bolted for the door morton leaped
after me curses showering from his
slavering mouth

  i flung the door open just in time
slammed it in the face of my pursuer
and spurning the gravel of the drive
with flying feet fairly flew toward
the outer gate

  as i swung the rusty and creaking
halves of the ancient gate together i
paused for a moment with beating
heart to look back at the gloomy old
pile i had just quitted

  morton was standing in the door-
way his figure clearly silhouetted by
the streaming yellow light he had
his hands on his hips and he was
shouting and roaring with obscene
mirth like some malicious demon
standing on the edge of hells yawn-
ing pit and laughing at the anguish
of the damned

co far as i am concerned this is the
 end of the story i have never
called on morton since that night at
times when i drive by his place i
see him wandering aimlessly a piti-
ful figure along the desolate and
weed-choked drive or sitting motion-
less and alone on the sagging rotting
porch

  probably you will not believe the
story morton told me i do not blame
you sometimes i doubt whether i
believe it myself

  but when i recall the hideous meta-
morphosis that changed a friend into
a demon seeking my very life and
all in less than the time it takes a
church bell to toll the hour of -
when i live that moment over again
i tell you friend i know
her words were drowned in a
great shout of fear as a lighted
torch fell from its bamboo socket
onto the palm-roofed house

dennis district officer of the
labuk district in british
north borneo had been
spending a few days local leave
on tingling estate for walkely the
manager and he were great friends
the night before his departure the
two men had sat together in the lat-
ters mosquito room fitted up like a
den and with pipes well lit had
roamed in desultory manner over
many fields of conversation

  for the last ten minutes or so
there had been silence between them
-the silence of friends in complete
accord dennis broke it

  throw me a match walley he
said

  walkely moved as though to com-
ply then stopped as his boy en-
tered carrying a tray containing
whisky and soda which he placed on
a table near his master he was
about to depart when walkely spoke

  the tuan is leaving tomorrow be-

fore breakfast amat tell cookie
to make some sandwiches and see the
thermos flask is filled with hot tea  

tuan

and hand these to the tuan
walkely pointed to the matches

amat obeyed and went out

walkely rose from his long chair
mixed the drinks and held out a glass
to dennis

to our next meeting he said
and raised his glass

 dennis followed suit

then yawning dennis rose and
stretching his arms well above his
head looked sleepily in the direction
of his bedroom

walkely nodded assent and held
open the mosquito door

a few minutes later the house was
in darkness save for the lights that
shone through the open windows of
the two bedrooms

the rooms were on either side of
a large dining room which in turn

                                  


weird tales

opened out from the main veranda
off one side of which was built the
mosquito room at the far end of
the dining room were two folding
doors that led to a passage and
pantry and thence down some steps
to the kitchen and boys  quarters
at the rear of the house

  as dennis undressed he sleepily
hummed the latest fox-trot record re-
ceived from england then dim-
ming the light he got into bed

  from where he lay he could
hear walkely moving about his room
and could see the reflection his light
cast on the exposed attap dried sago
leaves roof of the house as he idly
watched speculating dreamily on
walleys success as a manager
walkelys lamp in turn was lowered
followed the creaking noise of a body
turning on a spring mattress-then
silence

  dennis rolled from his left to right
side preparatory to sleep

  nighty-night old thing he
grunted

  night came back the sleepy re-
ply

  then all was quiet save for the
gentle rustling of the rubber trees
and the occasional hoot of an owl

  presently dennis awoke to full
alertness he was not strung up
no sound nor fear nor nightmare had
aroused him he was simply and
quietly awake turning on his side
he looked at his watch the hands
pointed to  a m he closed his
eyes but sleep would not be wooed

  for a long time dennis lay in the
nearly darkened room watching the
waving branch of a rubber tree out-
side the window that moved gently
to the sighing of the breeze

  suddenly he heard the sound of
feet ascending the steps that led from
garden to veranda doors

  but half awake he listened

slowly the footsteps mounted the
stairs then came the lifting of the
latch that fastened the low wooden
gates and the creaking of moving
hinges the footsteps entered con-
tinued the full length of the veranda
to pass into the dining room beyond
here for a moment they halted then
they moved again shuffling uncer-
tainly-forward backward sideways
-as those of a person trying to locate
something in the dark

 again they moved with steady
tread and reached the intervening
doors that shut off the passage

  dennis listened and waited what
the devil was old walley doing he
sleepily wondered

  a sudden rush of cool air struck
on him over the top of the bedroom
wall billowing out his mosquito net

  creak-creak-creak-the doors
were opening the footsteps went
along the passage and came to a
standstill at the end

  boy

  the call was clear and decisive but
dennis failed to quite recognize the
voice though he realized it was an
europeans

  there came no answer

  boy

  this time the call was sharper and
impatience was in its tone still no
reply

  in the silence dennis wondering
greatly waited for he was still un-
certain whether the voice was walke-
lys or anothers

  the footsteps sounded again as
they descended the stairs that led to
the servants  quarters on the bot-
tom step they halted

  boy

  the call was long loud and
angry yet still no answer came

  up the stairs the footsteps re-
turned they strode along the pass-
age paused as the doors were closed
and the latch clicked then swiftly
moved through the dining room out
the sacred jars



on to the wide veranda here for a
moment they rested

  sounded the fumbling for a latch
the squeak of a faulty hinge and
from the sharp banging of a door
dennis knew the footsteps had en-
tered the mosquito room

  he sprang out of bed and sitting
on its edge hurriedly pushed his feet
into slippers then as he was about
to move the lamp in the room went
out

  damn he muttered and fum-
bled for his matches but before he
found them he was listening to the
opening and shutting of drawers

  he struck a match and by its
light crossed to the lamp the wick
of which however refused to bum
though he wasted many matches up-
on it

  in the gathering darkness for the
moon was setting he moved toward
the door but with his hand upon the
knob stood still for the footsteps
were shuffling again and the sharp
banging to of the mosquito door made
him jump

  through the veranda the footsteps
went gaining sureness with every
stride the gates creaked and the
latch fell to down the stairs the
footsteps clumped the sound growing
fainter till it became lost in the
night

  three deep-toned notes from the
office gong boomed on the air den-
nis shivered kicked off his slippers
and returned to bed the air was
cold so he drew his blanket well
around him

  old walleys walking in his sleep
or else indulging in a midnight
prowl he muttered half a minute
later he was sound asleep

   s dennis eyes opened to the beau-
-ties of a tropic dawn the clink
of silver spoons against china reached
his ears and the scent of a cigarette
crept into the room

  he plunged his head into a basin

of cold water brushed his -hair and
still in his sarong and kabaiah sleep-
ing garments went out on to the
veranda where walkely paused in the
act of conveying a cup to his mouth

  morning dennis he grunted
and continued drinking his tea

  he was never very talkative the
first thing in the morning

  dennis answered and busied him-
self with the teapot then under
cover of meticulously choosing a piece
of toast he studied walkely who
showed no signs of having spent a
sleepless night

  suddenly walkely looked up and
  caught dennis eye upon him
  well he asked what is it
  nothing dennis curtly replied
  then why look at me like that
  sorry old thing dennis stam-
  mered  i was only wondering-

  yes

  what the devil were you up to
last night-walking all over the
house and shouting for your boy
then you heard it too walke-
ly asked the question with relief

  it whats it dennis retort-
ed didnt i hear you come up the
veranda steps open the gates and
walk to the back you called boy
three times but got no answer then
you walked back through the house
and down the steps what was
wrong walley

  walkely looked dennis full in the
ejres as he slowly answered

  nothing nothing was wrong
and i never moved from my room
till this morning

  but-then who the-

     i never moved   walkely repeat-
ed what you heard was glister
glister what on earth do you
mean whos glister

  you know the chap who was
manager here before bellamy he
shot himself died in your room-
on your bed hes buried in the gar-
den at the foot of the hill below your


weird tales

window great pity but-drink and
a native woman-nice chap too
walkely ceased as the light of
recollection shone on dennis face

  yes i remember he spoke al-
most to himself i met him once at
a jesselton race meeting a tall
good-looking fellow   

  walkely nodded and dennis con-
tinued

  he was awfully keen on a beau-
tiful native woman-a dusun named
jebee

  yes she was lured away from
glister by another man it was a
dirty thing to do

  	 the swine i only hope- 

  you neednt worry walkely in-
terrupted   he rues the day all right
ill bet for shes got him body and
soul-doped to the eyes-and her
temper is that of a fiend incarnate
she is priestess too of the gusi and
he darent call his soul his own

  so poor old glisters loss was
really his gain if only hed known
dennis words were gently spoken

  yes but he felt her absence
and in the loneliness that followed
the drink got him again

  for nearly a minute there was
silence between the two it was as if
their memories had recalled glisters
spirit to his old home almost as if he
were sitting at the table with them
while the tinkling of jebees anklets
sounded from an adjoining room   
dennis broke the silence

  and you mean that-that was he
last night he asked

  yes the word seemed drawn
reluctantly from walkelys lips

  but good lord man-you dont
mean-you cant-its preposter-
ous  

  i know walkely spoke slowly
it sounds absurd doesnt it but
old bellamy went through it saw
him and spoke to him and once even
shot at him

    bellamy bellamy shot him   

  yes and there isnt much mysti-
cism about him-hes as much imag-
ination as a turnip

 -but-

  all the buts in the world wont
alter matters bellamys seen him
ive seen him and youve heard him
hes there-and it happens and its

always the same-only-

 what the word was wrung
from dennis

  hes never entered the mosquito
room before

 you think-

  i dont know how can i im
only wondering why he went there-
what he was searching for

  drink perhaps

  walkely shook his head

    no   he said   the room wasnt
built in his days no theres some-
thing worrying him something thats
caused this variation of his usual
walk  

  his eyes met denniss and he gave
a short half-ashamed laugh then
get on with your tea when
youve finished well go and look at
his grave i always inspect it twice
a month and put a coolie on cleaning
it lip and looking after the flowers
well have a look today

as dennis dressed with unusual
slowness his mind was full of the
tragedy so strangely recalled poor
old glister he muttered what
an end

  an impatient call roused dennis
from his revery and he hastened to
the veranda to find walkely already
on the garden steps conversing with
gaga the head mandor overseer of
many years standing

  the three at once set off down
well-laid cement steps along a broad
path that wound among a profusion
of bright-colored flowers they went
overhead a flaming sun rode in an
azure sky and a faint breeze fanned
their faces with its cooling breath
perfumed with the scent of dew and
tiie sacred jars



the fragrant elusive blossoms of the
rubber trees

  at the foot of the hill they turned
and went in single file along a nar-
row path that followed the winding
contour of the hill

  the three walked in silence for
speech was difficult along that narrow
track suddenly the path dipping
down turned sharply and walkely
who was leading became for an in-
stant lost to view dennis humming
a dusun love song followed close be-
hind but as he reached the turn the
tune died abruptly on his lips and he
stood stone-still

    good lord what can it mean   

  the words were gasped by walke-
ly who stood transfixed staring with
horror-struck eyes straight before
him

  instinctively walkely turned to
dennis who like himself stood with
gaze fixed and staring eyes

  what can it mean he gasped
a second time

  for they had reached the grave
and it was open heaped under the
railings surrounding it which were
intact were piles of fresh-dug earth
and all round lay the scattered flow-
ers withered and trampled into
twisted shapes

  the eyes of dennis and walkely
met in each there lurked a question
that neither dared to ask each
heard again the shuffling footsteps of
the previous night and the opening
and shutting of the drawers in the
mosquito room

  a shadow fell across them as they
stood there came a startled cry the
quick pattering of bare feet and
gaga flung himself upon his knees
burying his hands in the earth

 gaga

  the word was a sharp command
of outraged wrath but the man did
not heed and his hands continued
fumbling fingering searching

  walkely stooped down to seize the
kneeling mandor by the shoulder

then straightened up as the latter
rose and turning showed a face pal-
lid under the yellow of his skin from
which stark horror shone

  the pandang buckle tuan
he gasped the pandang it has
gone 

  walkely looked at him in stupefac-
tion

  gaga he began but got no fur-
ther for the man heedless of walke-
lys upraised hand broke in

  the pandang tuan the silver
pandang the jebee used to wear as
token of her priesthood of the gusi
has gone the silver pandang is no
more  

  he ceased and for a moment there
was silence among the three

  on walkelys face there showed a
blank amazement but dennis brows
had gathered in a frown and his lips
had closed in a deep straight line
he was the first to speak

  walley he said may i ask
gaga questions   

  walkely nodded his assent and
dennis turned to gaga

  gaga tell me what makes you
say the silver pandang is no more

  because gaga stammered in his
emotion because-when tuan glis-
ter was buried the pandang was bur-
ned too-and-now-

  his gaze sought for the coffin for
a moment and he fingered a charm
of monkeys teeth that hung around
his neck

  tell me gaga dennis voice
was very gentle all you know be-
gin at the beginning

gaga looked relieved for a native
resents questioning and loves to
tell a story his own way

  the tuans know he began
that tuan glister had a nyai a na-
tive housekeeper named jebee she
came to him when she was very
young but vowed by the oaths of her
parents to the priesthood of the gusi
the sacred jars we dusans worship


weird tales

which only our womenkind may tend
but she was young and beautiful and
full of life her beauty was un-
matched in all this land of sabah
borneo her form was lithe her
footsteps light her waist was small
yet she was vowed in wifehood to a
jar the sacred gusi her lips and
eyes though warring with her blood
were innocent of love till tuan glis-
ter visited the village in seaich of
coolies for the estate

  then-gaga paused seeming
for a moment at a loss to find his
words-  then-the tuan was tall
and handsome and possessed golden
hair he had a laughing winning
way and eyes that darted here and
there and made the warm blood race
within your veins when once his
glance had rested on you his eyes
discovered jebee and-

  gaga looked nervously from den-
nis and walkely as he shuffled his
feet frightened of saying too much
concerning a white man before others
of his race

  dennis read the meaning of his
glance

  yes gaga you may speak he
said for the tuan besar manager
and i are friends and we would give
tuan glisters wandering spirit
peace say all that is in your heart
we understand

  tuan gagas tone conveyed a
depth of grateful meaning that
night there was dancing and feasting
in the village and pitcher after
pitcher of tapai fermented liquor
was consumed the tuan drank too
but none could stand against him
and one by one they sank into a
heavy sleep only the tuan remained
fie left the headmans house and go-
ing through the village reached je-
bees home

  it was that darkest hour before
lawn when the chill wind blows yet
she was seated on the topmost step
the light of the dying moon seemed
focused on the silver buckle that she

wore hung from a rotan girdle
round her waist

 their eyes met no word was
said the tuan stretched out his
arms and jebee went to him and the
tuans arms enfolded her

  gaga ceased the silence length-
ened till the office gong booming
eight deep notes shattered the spell

  how do you know all this ga-
ga walkely asked at length you
never mentioned it before

  a look of surprize flitted over the
mandors face then he quietly re-
plied 

 the tuan never asked me my
story before nor is it customary for
the white man to discuss others of
his race with natives how do i
know why tuan besar was i not
present on that night and is not je-
bee my sister though of a different
mother

    the tuan had saved my life and
jebee was young the warm blood
danced in her veins and her heart

cried out for a mate and so-

the river tuan flowed far from the
the village the tuans boat was
there all in the village slept the
tuan led her to the boat while i
stole up the steps entered the house
and made a bundle of her clothes
then to the waiting boat i followed
the tuan had covered jebee with his
coat and she was sleeping but the
silver buckle hung round his neck
and from that day it never left him
we three were alone in the boat the
tuan and i picked up the paddles
and as their blades in silence touched
the water the moon slipped beneath
the earth and the burong liantu owl
hooted thrice an evil omen which
the tuan heeded not and jebee did
not hear

  	 till the sun was high we paddled
and by noon were far beyond pur-
suit for the river flowed very swift-
ly and one does not wake early from
such a sleep as those in the village
were sleeping
the sacred jars



  gaga paused then he added

  the rest of the story the tuans
know for a little while the tuan
and jebee were happy but the
omen of the bur on g hantu and the
dying moon would not be denied

  and the shadow of the gusi lay
between them so though the tuan
loved her he drank too deeply and
she found favor in anothers sight
and went away but the tuans
know the rest i buried him-there
was no white man on the estate-and
as he died he made me promise to
bury the buckle with him hanging
round his neek it was the only
thing of jebees that he kept

  and now

  dennis put the question sharply
and his eyes held gagas gaze

  i am afraid tuan-sore afraid

  of what

  i do not know and the silver
pandang has been stolen though its
hiding place was unknown  to none
has it value save to my people and
for years now they have let it rest
but tuan they never forget and
the gusi is most sacred in the great
blue jar that jebee used to tend and
should have wedded mabago the bad
spirit dwells of late evil has be-
fallen my people the buffalos bring
forth no young and the crops refuse
to ripen so tuan i am afraid

    aga ceased and once again a
    silence fell upon the three

  suddenly it was broken by the hur-
rying footsteps and labored breathing
of a man who ran and round the
bend appeared an opas

  all three looked up at his approaeh
and saw stark fear upon his face

  tuan tuan he gasped tuan
glister can not be found his house
is empty and his bedroom disar-
ranged and on the floor is a pool of
blood-

  his eyes caught sight of the open
grave the words faltered on his

tongue then ceased and he stood
silent trembling like a leaf

  at the mention of that name den-
nis started but before he could speak
walkely answered the question hov-
ering on his lips

  young glisters my new assist-
ant dennis he spoke in a queer
strained voice he came only last
month you havent met him yet
but-

  hes a younger brother of-

walkely looked toward the grave
its horrible he muttered

  in a flash the meaning of the rifled
grave and glisters disappearance
grew plain and the frown on den-
nis face grew deeper and his lips
grew more compressed heedless of
walkelys questionings of the jib-
bering opas he turned to gaga

  gaga he said i see the hand
of maboga stretching out seeking re-
venge for the insult of years ago
his arm is long it stretches from
the tuans grave to a village in the
hills is it not so

  tuan gaga answered

  it stretches dennis continued
from the village to the new tuans
house as well for what the white man
took must be repaid with interest
what think yoii gaga

  that the tuan is wise and reads
the dusun as a book

  dennis walkely had dismissed
the opas and putting out his hand
grasped dennis arm dennis
he cried what do you mean glis-
ter has disappeared theres blood up-
on his floor and we stand here while
heaven knows what devils work is
being done what do you mean-
with interest

  listen walley dennis weighed
his words and spoke with slow con-
viction im in the dark almost as
mueh as you-but i know the du-
suns and the fetish of their gusi
worship when glister took jebee
from her people she broke their
vows and outraged the sacred jars


weird tales

but while the years were plentiful
and their calves were strong they did
not worry when as now the inevit-
able lean year comes they seek a
reason for their troubles  

  you mean-v asked walkely

-still perplexed

  that reason is maboga they
think he will not be appeased un-
less-

  dennis did not finish but his
glance wandered to the open grave
and back to walkelys strained white
face on which the dawning light of
comprehension showed

    good heavens he muttered
you really think

  dennis nodded then turned to
gaga

  gaga he said tell me exactly
what happens at the feast

  the silver buckles of the priest-
esses tuan are hung upon the gusts
lips then when the dying moon is
half-way set the mateless wives say
prayers and wash the sacred jars
and call upon the spirits to come
forth and give their judgment on the
village for the year this year i
think mabogas jar will once again
be decked but who will cleanse the
sacred lips i can not think for while
jebee lives the pandang may be worn
by no one else tuan glister dared
and paid the price

  and maboga dennis voice
was low almost a whisper

  for a moment gaga hesitated then
he replied   the tuan himself has
said  what the white man took must
be repaid-with interest

  he paused then he added a
white mans head has never yet hung
in a dusun house but three days
hence maboga will decide

  the eyes of dennis and walkely
met both seemed to hear again the
shufflings in the night the opening
and the shutting of the drawers
both understood the object of that
search

  ill borrow glisters revolver
walley for well go alone with only
gaga as our guide and attend this
feast said dennis

for hours the booming of gongs
had been borne upon the breeze
yet though the three had been stead-
ily ascending the deep-toned notes
still sounded far awtay

  on the crest of a hill dennis and
his companions halted for a brief
rest and then onward and upward
the trio climbed while the track grew
narrower and stonier and the jungle
pressed closer on eveiy side and long
trailing thorn-edged creepers hang-
ing from the trees whipped their
faces and tore their clothes

  the leading beast stopped and
gaga raised his hand without a
word the two white men drew level
for the path had widened out and
they stood upon the border of a glade
dissected by a muddy stream whose
banks were scored with a myriad hoof-
marks

  gaga slipped from his animal and
softly spoke

  we are nearly there tuan this
is their grazing ground but all the
animals are at the village for all have
ridden to the feast  

  dennis nodded and proceeded like
the others to tether his beast

  then on foot the three moved for-
ward but with a quicker pace for
the gongs were loudly booming with
a beat that would not be denied
even as they crossed the muddy
stream the swaying rhythmic time
rising and falling with the cadence
of a dance gave place to an insistent
note that rose and rose till only one
intense vibration one single throb-
bing note beat on the heavy air with
a malignant strength sapping all
kindly thoughts and fanning to
flame the primal lusts of hate and
vengeance

  a little farther and the path rose
with a sudden precipitousness that
the sacred jars



forced them to mount the well-worn
stones as though they climbed a stair
they reached the top to stand upon
a tiny plain on which the shadows
of the encircling trees were slowly
lengthening

  even as they rested to regain their
breath that one insistent note ceased
and for an instant silence reigned

  then from the glades farther end
arose a cry faint at first theri slowly
louder harsher stronger swelling
to a mighty paean to a tumultuous
cry maboga maboga aki fa-
ther  maboga   and stillness once
again save for the hurried padding
of running feet as the three raced
across the shadow-flecked glade

  panting they reached a wall of
jungle pierced by a sunken path that
twined its short length through the
heart of a moss-clad hill whose riv-
en sides were lit with weird fantastic
lights thrown from countless torches
that burned upon a plateau at its
end

  in the shadow of a belt of trees
they paused to take stock of their
surroundings

  the plateau formed a horseshoe
and at its apex stood a native house
built eight feet off the ground whose
length stretched three hundred feet
at either end leading to the only
doors were rough-hewn steps carved
from solid logs of timber and from
these steps arose two poles six feet
in height between which was
stretched a length of knotted rotan
from this like a gruesome necklace
hung two rows of ghastly human
heads-blackened and dried from
the smoke of years-save at each
end and there hung two heads with
staring sightless eyes and bared lips
exposing whitened teeth and from
them the red blood dripped

  upon the ground placed in a semi-
circle stood the jars - the sacred
oiisi - ranged in accordance with
their height and rank from either
end they tapered up toward the

central spot where side by side rose
two of flaming blue that reached the
height of a mans shoulder

  the rim or lip of each was of a
different hue-one black one white-
while from the neck of those whose
lip was black grew four large ears
and in the lobes of each was placed
a human skull

  behind each jar save one a wo-
man stood her thick black hair piled
high upon her head framing her
lime-washed face from which her 
dark eyes shone her figure swathed
from chin to toe in shrouded black
girt at the waist with a girdle of
mice and monkeys teeth

  a silver pan dang hung under the
lip of every jar but one and resting
on its swelling shoulder shimmered
and winked in the torches fantastic
light

  facing the jars the dusuns sat in
rows immobile and intent there
shone upon the face of every one a
strained expectancy showing in the
taut muscles of the back and the
restless twining fingers of the hands
thus they waited-in that strange
uncanny silence-for the answer to
their cry maboga maboga aki
maboga

  almost forgetful of the purpose of
their errand dennis and walkely
watched fascinated by the scene be-
fore them lit by the waning moon
and the lurid flickering torches
something of its primeval instincts
and the tension of the squatting na-
tives crept into their veins and held
them spellbound as they gazed upon
the colored jars with their glittering
shining buckles each with its dumb
attendant white-faced woman
backed by the long unbroken shadow
of the palm-roofed house

  while the moon sank slowly in the
west until its lower rim began to kiss
the topmost ridge of the roof the
silence lengthened till it seemed as if
nature slept and those rows of squat-


weird tales

ting natives were graven images de-
void of breath

  but all at once there came a creak-
ing sound and the tension snapped
a long rippling murmur half sigh
half gasp filled the air and gagas
hand gripped dennis arm

    look tuan look  he whispered
and pointed to a hut which stood
alone and almost hidden in the shade
of a mighty billian tree

  the two men obeyed following
the line of gagas pointing finger

  the hut door opened slowly as the
noise increased but though no light
burned within a shadowy form was
faintly visible moving toward the
glade slowly silently though still
half-hidden by the shade the form
drew near then as all eyes were
turned upon it a glinting speck of
light winked in the gloom and as
the figure moved the winking light
moved too

  slowly steadily from the shade in-
to the flickering fringe of torches
from the fringe into the full lurid
glare moved the figure and the light

a quick intake of many breaths a
long loud gasp of terrified sur-
prize then silence-and a woman
with a silver buckle hanging from a
girdle round her waist stood before
the great blue sacred jar from under
whose deep black lip no silver buckle
hung

  over the silence that like a living
spirit lay upon the glade gagas ex-
cited whisper just reached dennis
and walkelys ears

  tuan it is jebee and she wears
the silver pandang that i buried in
tuan glisters grave tuan tuan
i am afraid  

  even as he spoke the woman raised
her rounded arms on which no
gleaming bangles shone and with a
single gesture unloosed the coils of
her high-wound hair the long
thick tresses fell around her like a
black cloak

  again she raised her arms this
time in supplication and her low
clear voice went chanting through
the glade

  aki maboga of the sacred gusi
spirit of evil who dwelleth in the
great blue jar hear now thy erring
daughter thy forsworn priestess
and forgive here in my shame i
stand before thee and the assembled
people bearing the silver pandang
symbol of thy might and power
which in my youth and wilful love i
disgraced

  thou who for long has been
neglected till thy just wrath burst
into flame so that the crops no long-
er ripen and the herds cease to bring
forth young lift i beseech thee
aki maboga the shadow of thy anger
from off my race

  through me and for my sin my
people have been punished through
me oh aki pronounce the penance
thou dost claim

  she ceased and as a wailing cry
rose from the assembled natives
slipped slowly to her knees and
flinging her arms round the great
jars neck rested her lips upon its
blackened rim

  walkely stirred but dennis warn-
ing hand bade him keep still gaga
speechless and with bulging eyes
stared at the kneeling figure

  a wind was stirring in the trees
the moon had sunk completely out
of sight and here and there a flicker-
ing torch gutted and burnt out

  thus in the creeping darkness they
waited while the moments grew to
minutes burdened with suspense-
waited for mabogas answer that his
deep black lips would whisper in je-
bees listening ear

  at length with infinite grace she
rose and stood clothed in her long
black hair behind the great blue jar
for on its swelling shoulders glinting
against its deep black lip the silver
pandang lay
the sacred jars



  the wind was sighing in the trees
the rustling leaves made soft accom-
paniment to her voice which trem-
bled with emotion

  my lips have kissed the sacred
gusi-my tears have washed its deep
black lip the silver pandang has
returned to deck the shrine of the
great spirit who has spoken for my
ears have caught his whispering
breath

  a murmur rose then faded and
she continued

  rejoice oh people for i see the
crops on all the hillsides ripening
and herds with their young but for
his clemency maboga asks a price
she paused then stretching out
her arms cried in a ringing voice
what will you give my people to
allay your desperate plight

  quick as the summer lightning
swift as an adders tongue came the
answer from those rows of waiting
natives

 what the white man took let
him repay with interest the head of
the white mans brother we will give
as a make-peace to maboga and as
thy wedding gift

  she raised her hand and there
was silence

    thy words are good thy offering

acceptable unto-

 her words were drowned in a
great shout of fear as a lighted torch
fell from its bamboo socket on to the
palm-roofed house

  like running water fanned by the
rising breeze the flames spread rap-
idly till in the twinkling of an eye
the wooden house was nothing but
three hundred feet of sheeted flame

 then pandemonium reigned and
terror stalked the glade

  but to the watching three the fire
was providential for the burning
house lit up the hut till now hidden
in the gloom and at its single window
they beheld young glisters blood-
stained face

  under the shadow of the trees
skirting the edge of the tiny plain
they raced a few more yards and
they would reach the door another
second-out of the shadows by the
hut a naked figure sprang her long
black hair streaming in the breeze a
glittering sharp-edged sword in her
hand

  with an oath walkely forged
ahead but missing his footing on a
twisted root stumbled and fell

  the sudden instinctive -tightening
of his fingers a flare and a sharp re-
port  a cry of pain a sagging droop-
ing form-and jebee lay a crumpled
figure across the threshold of the hut

a year of plenty had elapsed since
the feast of the gusi and den-
nis was going on leave

  lolling over the taffrail of the
steamer which would take him to
singapore he talked to walkely who
had come to see him off

  for a few minutes the two smoked
in friendly silence then walkely
spoke

  by the way old thing he
said i mustnt forget to give you
gagas greetings and young glis-
ters best salaams

  dennis grunted thanks then his
hand fell on walkelys arm

  and you walley he asked

  fit as a fiddle came the ir-
relevant reply for the flowers are
growing again on glisters grave and
he no longer haunts the house

by h p lovecraft

am basil elton keeper of the
north point light that my father
and grandfather kept before me
far from the shore stands the gray
lighthouse above sunken slimy rocks
that arc seen when the tide is low but
unseen when the tide is high past
that beacon for a century have swept
the majestic barques of the seven
seas in the days of my grandfather
there were many in the days of my
father not so many and now there
are so few that i sometimes feel
strangely alone as though i were the
last man on our planet

  from far shores came those white-
sailed argosies of old from far east-
ern shores where warm suns shine
and sweet odors linger about strange
gardens and gay temples the old
captains of the sea came often to my
grandfather and told him of these
things which in turn he told to my
father and my father told to me in
the long autumn evenings when the
wind howled eerily from the east
and i have read more of these tilings
and of many things besides in the
books men gave me when i was young
and filled with wonder

  but more wonderful than the lore
of old men and the lore of books is
the secret lore of ocean blue green
gray white or black smooth ruffled
or mountainous that ocean is not si-
lent all my days have i watched it
and listened to it and i know it well
at first it told to me only the plain
little tales of calm beaches and near
ports but with the years it grew more
friendly and spoke of other things of
things more strange and more distant
in space and in time sometimes at
twilight the gray vapors of the hori-


  zon have parted to grant me glimpses
of the ways beyond and sometimes
at night the deep waters of the sea
have grown clear and phosphorescent
to grant me glimpses of the ways be-
neath and these glimpses have been
as often of the ways that were and
the ways that might be as of the
ways that are for ocean is more
ancient than the mountains and
freighted with the memories and the
dreams of time

  out of the south it was that the
white ship used to come when the
moon was full and high in the heav-
ens out of the south it would glide
very smoothly and silently over the
sea and whether the sea was rough
or calm and whether the wind was
friendly or adverse it would always
glide smoothly and silently its sails
distant and its long strange tiers of
oars moving rhythmically one night
i espied upon the deck a man beard-
ed and robed and he seemed to beck-
on me to embark for fair unknown
shores many times afterward i saw
him under the full moon and ever
did he beckon me

  very brightly did the moon shine
on the night i answered the call and

i	walked out over the waters to the
white ship on a bridge of moon-
beams the man who had beckoned
now spoke a welcome to me in a soft
language i seemed to know well and
the hours were filled with soft songs
of the oarsmen as we glided away in-
to a mysterious south golden with
the glow of that full mellow moon

 and when the day dawned rosy
and effulgent i beheld the green
shore of far lands bright and beauti-
ful and to me unknown up from
the white ship



the sea rose lordly terraces of ver-
dure tree-studded and shewing here
and there the gleaming white roofs
and colonnades of stiange temples
as we drew nearer the green shore
the bearded man told me of that land
the land of zar where dwell all the
dreams and thoughts of beauty that
come to men once and then are for-
gotten and when i looked upon the
terraces again i saw that what he
said was true for among the sights
before me were many things i had
once seen through the mists beyond
the horizon and in the phosphorescent
depths of ocean there too were
forms and fantasies more splendid
than any i had ever known the vi-
sions of young poets who died in want
before the world could learn of what
they had seen and dreamed but we
did not set foot upon the sloping
meadows of zar for it is told that he
who treads them may nevermore re-
turn to his native shore

  as the white ship sailed silently
away from the templed terraces of
zar we beheld on the distant horizon
ahead the spires of a mighty city
and the bearded man said to me
this is thalarion the city of a
thousand wonders wherein reside
all those mysteries that man has striv-
en in vain to fathom   and i looked
again at closer range and saw that
the city was greater than any city i
had known or dreamed of before in-
to the sky the spires of its temples
reached so that no man might behold
their peaks and far back beyond the
horizon stretched the grim gray
walls over which one might spy only
a few roofs weird and ominous yet
adorned with rich friezes and allur-
ing sculptures i yearned mightily
to enter this fascinating yet repellent
city and besought the bearded man
to land me at the stone pier by the
huge carven gate akariel but he
gently denied my wish saying   into
thalarion the city of a thousand
wonders many have passed but none

returned therein walk only deemons
and mad things that are no longer
men and the streets are white with
the unburied bones of those who have
looked upon the eidolon lathi that
reigns over the city so the white
ship sailed on past the walls of tha-
larion and followed for many days
a southward-flying bird whose glossy
plumage matched the sky out of
which it had appeared

  then came we to a pleasant coast
gay with blossoms of every hue
where as far inland as we could see
basked lovely groves and radiant
arbors beneath a meridian sun from
bowers beyond our view came bursts
of song and snatches of lyric har-
mony interspersed with faint laugh-
ter so delicious that i urged the row-
ers onward in my eagerness to reach
the scene and the bearded man
spoke no word but watched me as
we approached the lily-lined shore
suddenly a wind blowing from over
the flowery meadows and leafy woods
brought a scent at which i trembled
the wind grew stronger and the air
was filled with the lethal charnel
odor of plague-stricken towns and
uncovered cemeteries and as we
sailed madly away from that dam-
nable coast the bearded man spoke at
last saying this is xura the land
of pleasures unattained

  so once more the white ship fol-
lowed the bird of heaven over warm
blessed seas fanned by caressing aro-
matic breezes day after day and
night after night did we sail and
when the moon was full we would
listen to soft songs of the oarsmen
sweet as on that distant night when
we sailed away from my far native
land and it was by moonlight that
we anchored at last in the harbor of
sona-nyl which is guarded by twin
headlands of crystal that rise from
the sea and meet in a resplendent
arch this is the land of fancy and
we walked to the verdant shore upon
a golden bridge of moonbeams


weird

tales

  in the land of sona-nyl there is
neither time nor space neither suffer-
ing nor death and there i dwelt for
many asons green are the groves
and pastures bright and fragrant the
flowers blue and musical the streams
clear and cool the fountains and
stately and gorgeous the temples
castles -and cities of sona-nyl of
that land there is no bound for be-
yond each vista of beauty rises an-
other more beautiful over the coun-
tryside and amidst the splendor of
cities can move at will the happy folk
of whom all are gifted with unmarred
grace and unalloyed happiness for
the aeons that i dwelt there i wan-
dered blissfully through gardens
where quaint pagodas peep from
pleasing clumps of bushes and where
the white walks are bordered with
delicate blossoms i climbed gentle
hills from whose summits i could see
entrancing panoramas of loveliness
with steepled towns nestling in ver-
dant valleys and with the golden
domes of gigantic cities glittering on
the infinitely distant horizon and i
viewed by moonlight the sparkling
sea the crystal headlands and the
placid harbor wherein lay anchored
the white ship

it was against the full moon one
night in the immemorial year of
tharp that i saw outlined the beck-
oning form of the celestial bird and
felt the first stirrings of unrest then
i spoke with the bearded man and
told him of my new yearnings to de-
part for remote cathuria which no
man hath seen but which all believe
to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the
west it is the land of hope and
in it shine the perfect ideals of all
that we know elsewhere or at least
so men relate but the bearded man
said to me beware of those peril-
ous seas wherein men say cathuria
lies in sona-nyl there is no pain
nor death but who can tell what lies
beyond the basalt pillars of the

west natheless at the next full
moon i boaided the white ship and
with the reluctant bearded man left
the happy harbor for untraveled
seas

  and the bird of heaven flew be-
fore and led us toward the basalt
pillars of the west but this time the
oarsmen sang no soft songs under the
full moon in my mind i would
often picture the unknown land of
cathuria with its splendid groves and
palaces and would wonder what new
delights there awaited me  cathu-
ria  i would say to myself is the
abode of gods and the land of un-
numbered cities of gold its forests
are of aloe and sandalwood even as
the fragrant groves of camorin and
among the trees flutter gay birds
sweet with song on the green and
flowery mountains of cathuria stand
temples of pink marble rich with
carven and painted glories and hav-
ing in their courtyards cool fountains
of silver where purl with ravishing
music the scented waters that come
from the grotto-born river narg
and the cities of cathuria are cinc-
tured with golden walls and their
pavements also are of gold in the
gardens of these cities are strange
orchids and perfumed lakes whose
beds are of coral and amber at
night the streets and the gardens are
lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from
the three-colored shell of the tortoise
and here resound the soft notes of
the singer and the lutanist and the
houses of the cities of cathuria are
all palaces each built over a fragrant
canal bearing the waters of the sacred
narg of marble and porphyry are
the houses and roofed with glittering
gold that reflects the rays of the sun
and enhances the splendor of the
cities as blissful gods view them from
the distant peaks fairest of all is
the palace of the great monarch
dorieb whom some say to be a demi-
god and others a god high is the
palace of dorieband many are the
the white ship



turrets of marble upon its walls in
its wide halls may multitudes as-
semble and here hang the trophies of
the ages and the roof is of pure
gold set upon tall pillars of ruby and
azure and having such carven figures
of gods and heroes that he who looks
up to those heights seems to gaze up-
on the living olympus and the
floor of the palace is of glass under
which flow the cunningly lighted
waters of the narg gay with gaudy
fish not known beyond the bounds of
lovely cathuria

  thus would i speak to myself of
cathuria but ever would the bearded
man warn me to turn back to the
happy shores of sona-nyl for sona-
nyl is known of men while none hath
ever beheld cathuria

  and on the thirty-first day that we
followed the bird we beheld the ba-
salt pillars of the west shrouded
in mist they were so that no man
might peer beyond them or see their
summits-which indeed some say
reach even to the heavens and the
bearded man again implored me to
turn back but i heeded him not for
from the mists beyond the basalt pil-
lars i fancied there came the notes
of singer and lutanist sweeter than
the sweetest songs of sona-nyl and
sounding mine own praises the
praises of me who had voyaged far
under the full moon and dwelt in the
land of fancy

  so to the sound of melody the
white ship sailed into the mist be-
twixt the basalt pillars of the west
and when the music ceased and the
mist lifted we beheld not the land
of cathuria but a swift-rushing re-
sistless sea over which our helpless
barque was borne toward some un-
known goal soon to our ears came
the distant thunder of falling wat-
ers and to our eyes appeared on the
far horizon ahead the titanic spray
of a monstrous cataract wherein the

oceans of the world drop down to
abysmal nothingness then did the
bearded man say to me with tears on
his cheek we have rejected the
beautiful land of sona-nyl which
we may never behold again the
gods are greater than men and they
have conquered and i closed my
eyes before the crash that i knew
would come shutting out the sight of
the celestial bird which flapped its
mocking blue wings over the brink of
the torrent

  out of that crash came darkness
and i heard the shrieking of men and
of things which were not men from
the east tempestuous winds arose
and chilled me as i crouched on the
slab of damp stone which had risen
beneath my feet then as i heard an-
other crash i opened my eyes and be-
held myself upon the platform of
that lighthouse whence i had sailed
so many aeons ago in the darkness
below there loomed the vast blurred
outlines of a vessel breaking up on
the cruel rocks and as i glanced out
over the waste i saw that the light
had failed for the first time since my
grandfather had assumed its care

  and in the later watches of the
night when i went within the tower
i saw on the wall a calendar which
still remained as when i had left it
at the hour i sailed away with the
dawn i descended the tower and
looked for wreckage vipon the rocks
but what i found was only this a
strange dead bird whose hue was as
of the azure sky and a single shat-
tered spar of a whiteness greater
than that of the wave-tips or of the
mountain snow

  and thereafter the ocean told me
its secrets no more and though many
times since has the moon shone full
and high in the heavens the white
ship from the south came never
again

a weird-scientific serial

by john martin leahy

the story so far

ivtilton rhodes and bill carter following an
angel and her ape-bat demon which has
killed rhoda dillingham on mount rainier pen-
etrate into the subterranean caverns beneath the
mountain there they are attacked by the ape-
bat which they slay and they rescue the angel
from being dragged down to her death by its
death-struggles in company with the angel
and four of her companions from some under-
ground city they begin the descent to drome

chapter 

what next

for a mile or more the way led
amongst pillars and stalagmites
oh the wonders that we saw in
that great cavern the exigencies of
space however will not permit me to
dwell upon them there is i may
remark no deposition of sinter going
on now undoubtedly many centuries
have rolled over this old globe since
the drip ceased perhaps thousands
upon thousands of years who can
say how little can scientists ever
know even when their knowledge
seems so great of those dim lost ages
of the earth

  one thing that puzzles me i
remarked is that each of these
hypogeans has nothing but a can-
teen so far as i can see the whole
party hasnt the makings of a lunch
for a ladybug can it be that we
have not far to go after all

   i think bill that well find tire
way a long one my explanation is
that on starting for the bridge they
disencumbered themselves of the pro-
vision-supply if they were not in
camp so that of course they could
make greater speed that the angel
had a companion back there we


know we know too that that com-
panion-in all likelihood it was one
of the girls-went for help  

  what on earth were they doing
there with the men off some place
else

     i wish i could tell you bill and
what was the angel doing up in the
tamahnowis rocks all by her lovely
lonesome i wish you could tell me
that  

  i wish that i could and that
isnt the only thing that i wish i
could tell you what on earth are
they doing here and what at the
tamahnowis rocks

  what bill are we

  but women said i our ex-
plorers dont take women along
lewis and clark took a woman
along and took her papoose to boot
and this isnt our world remember
things may be very different here
maybe in this subterranean land
the lady is the boss  

  where i exclaimed isnt she
the boss you dont have to come
down here to find a-what do you call
it-a gynecocracy which reminds
me of saxe

  what does saxe say sweet mis-
ogynist

  this sweet gyneolator

men dying make their wills

   but wives escape a work so sad

why should they make the gentle dames
  what all their lives theyve had

  bravo cried milton rhodes
and i saw the angel who with the
older man was leading the way turn
and give us a curious look
drome



  and that said rhodes re-
minds me

  of what

  who is the leader of this little
party-that man or our angel

  id say the angel if i could only
understand why she should be the
leader  

  at length we passed the last pillar
and the last stalagmite all this
time we had been descending at a
gentle slope the way now led into a
tunnel rather wide and lofty at first
the going was easy enough for a
mile or so the descent was still gen-
tle and the floor of the passage was
but little broken the spot was then
reached where that tunnel bifurcates
and there were the packs of our hy-
pogeans-or rather their knapsacks
there were five one for each the
mens being large and heavy

  you see bill queried milton
evidently our little hypothesis was
correct  

  i see i nodded we have far
to go

  very far i fancy

  also in this place were the phos-
phorus-lamps of the dromans one
for each these were somewhat simi-
lar to the ones that rhodes and i
carried save that the droman lamps
could be darkened whereas the only
way we could conceal the light of
ours was to put them into their
cylinders as was the case with our
phials the light emitted by these ves-
sels was a feeble one undoubtedly
though they would remain luminous
for a long period and hence their
real their very great value besides
the lanterns oil-burning of which
the dromans had three the phos-
phorus-lamps were pale and sorry
things but when one remembered
that they would shed light steadily
for months perhaps while the flames
of the lanterns were dependent upon
the oil supply those pale ghostly
lights became very wonderful things

  the light i said as we stood ex-
amining one of these objects is cer-
tainly phosphorescent but what is
that fluid in the glass

  i cant tell you bill it may be
some vegetable juice there is by
the way a brazilian plant called
euphorbia phosphorea the juice of
which is luminous this may be
something similar who knows  
the men unbent their bows and
thrust them into the quivers each
took up his or her knapsack and we
were under way again it was the
right branch of the tunnel into which
the route led us that fact rhodes
put down in his notebook i could
see no necessity for such a record
for surely we could not forget the
fact even if we tried

  well record it said milton
certitude to the contrary notwith-
standing and well keep adding to
the record as we go down too theres
no telling remember it may not be
so easy to find the way out of this
place as it seems  

you said i reminded him
that we may never want to return
and i say it again but i say
this too we may be mighty glad in-
deed to get out 

  soon the slope of the passage was
no longer gentle an hour or so and
the descent was so steep and difficult
that we had to exercise every caution
and care in going down it noon
found us still toiling down that steep
and tortuous way we then halted
for luncheon the dromans ate and

  	one dark night about the beginning of
dacember while passing along the streets of the
villa de natividada i observed some boys amus-
ing themselves with some luminous object which
i at first supposed to be a kind of large firefly
but on making inquiry i found it to be a beau-
tiful phosphorescent fungus belonging to the
genus a gar tens    the whole plant gives out
at night a bright phosphorescent light of a
pale greenish hue similar to that emitted by the
larger fireflies or by those curious soft-bodied
marine animals the pyrosomac from this cir-
cumstance and from growing on a palm it is
called by the inhabitants flor de coco the
light given out by a few of these fungi in a dark
room was sufficient to read by-george gardner


weird tales

drank very sparingly-though this
work gives one a most remarkable ap-
petite rhodes and i endeavored to
emulate their example

  as we sat there resting the dro-
mans held a low and earnest colloquy
the girls though had but very little
to say the subject of the dialogue
was an utter mystery to us only
one thing could wo tell and that was
that the matter which they were re-
volving was one of some gravity
once and only once did we hear the
word drome

  also it was then that we first heard
the name of our angel we could
not be certain at the time that was
her name but there was no uncer-
tainty about the name itself-drora-
thusa ere the afternoon was far
advanced however we saw our be-
lief become a certitude drorathusa
i confess that there was in my mind
something rather awesome about that
name and i wondered if that awe-
some something was existent only in
my mind diorathusa it seemed to
possess some of that sibylline qual-
ity which in the woman herself was
so indefinable and mysterious

  drorathusa sibylline certainly
that name and beautiful too i
thought

  in our world it would in all like-
lihood be shortened to drora or
thusa but it was never so here no
droman indeed would be guilty of a
barbarism like that it was always
drorathusa-the accent  the pe-
nultimate and every syllable clear
and full drorathusa milton
rhodes declared it was the most
beautiful name he had ever heard in
all his life

  it was about  oclock when we is-
sued from that passage steep to the
last and found ourselves in a great
broken cavern the rock was gran-
ite the place jagged and savage-
looking as though seen in some
strange and awful dream

  here we rested for a while and i

for one was glad enough to do so i
was tired sore and stiff from head
to foot-especially to foot

  just by the tunnels mouth there
was some writing on the wall before
this drorathusa and the older man
his name we had learned was
narkus  stood for some moments
this examination and the short dia-
logue which followed it left them i
noticed even more grave of aspect
and demeanor than we had ever seen
them i wondered what it could
mean i felt a vague uneasiness a
nameless forboding was creeping over
me

  it was futile to think and wonder
what it meant and yet i could not
help doing it glad had i been to
stop but strangely enough glad i
was to get under way once more for
twas only so that we could hope to
get the answer

  well we got it-an answer that i
wish never to know again

chapter 

the labyrinth-lost

vxre soon saw that we had entered
  not a cavern but a perfect
labyrinth of caverns i could never
have imagined a place like that it
was bewildering dreadful forsooth
in the possibilities that it limned on
the canvas of ones imagination how
on earth could anyone ever have
found his way through it  but some-
body had for these were the inscrip-
tions and signs on the wall for
these dromans kept a keen watch
and the relief evinced whenever one
was sighted showed what a frightful
thing it might be to lose the way

  an hour passed another and still
we were moving in that awful maze

  great erebus said i do you
think that we can ever find our way
back through this

  ive got it all down here bill
returned rhodes tapping his note-
drome



book the angel the leader now
is finding her way through it what
she can do cant we do also

  she isnt through it yet it is
some time too since we saw one of
those directions on the wall the fact
is unless i am greatly mistaken our
dromans are becoming uneasy
think so bill i confess i
thought that myself but i was not
sure that it wasnt only a fancy

  i wish that i could believe so
as rhodes had remarked drora-
thusa was the leader now and a
striking sight it was-her tall white
figure leading the way the shadows
quivering swaying rushing over the
broken savage walls and deepening
to inky blackness in the secret places
we passed

  farther and farther we went deep-
er and deeper but never another in-
scription was seen the advance be-
came broken irresolute then sud-
denly there was a halt and at that
instant the last vestige of uncertain-
ly vanished drorathusa had lost the
way

  there was a sudden panicky fear
in the eyes of the girls but it soon
was gone the little party met this
most unpleasant truth with exem-
plary philosophy there was a short
consultation and then we began to
retrace our way the object was of
course to return to the last mark on
the wall if we missed it then heav-
en help us

  perhaps i thought it will be
heaven help us anyway

  and it was

  we reached our objective without
misadventure and then a new start
was made rhodes and i were great-
ly puzzled for it was patent that
neither the angel nor anyone else
knew how they had gone astray
and not knowing that how could
anyone tell which way to go 

  better get it clear in that note-
book i admonished rhodes it

a queer business and i dont pretend
to understand it at all  

  we came along for a half-mile or
so carefully and with no little appre-
hension and then hurrah there was
a sign on the wall the route to
drome again but for how long 

  drorathusa quickened her pace
she was moving along now as though
in confidence certitude even i have
never been able to explain what fol-
lowed for a time an hour or more
that confidence of hers certainly was
fully justified then came the
change suddenly we became aware
of an unpleasant fact-there was
something wrong not that we re-
mained in doubt as to what that
something was which was wrong a
few minutes and we had a fact even
more unpleasant presented to our
contemplation-again we had gone
astray

  once more there was a consulta-
tion and once more we retraced our
steps-i mean we started to retrace
them neither i nor anyone else
could tell how it happened not that
i marveled at our failure to return
even though i could not explain just
how we had missed the way how-
ever it was no longer possible to
blink the fact that we were utterly
lost in this maze of passages caverns
and chambers

  i raised my canteen and shook it
my heart sank at that feeble wish-
wash sound the canteen was almost
empty nor was any one of the
others in this respect much more
fortunate than myself our position
truly was an unpleasant one-appal-
ling even in the grisly possibilities
which it presented to the mind

chapter 

through the hewn pas-
sage

 could set down no adequate rec-
ord of those hours which followed
it was late now and yet on and on


weird tales

we went mile after mile deeper and
deeper but only it seemed to in-
volve ourselves the more hopelessly
in the dread mysteries of that fear-
some place i wondered if it was my
imagination that made it so but cer-
tainly the confusion of those cham-
bers and caverns seemed to become
only confusion worse confounded

  at last and suddenly came the dis-
covery

  we had entered a long and nar-
row chamber and were drawing near
the end wondering if we should find
an exit there of a sudden there was
a sharp exclamation from the lips of
drorathusa who was some distance
in advance-an exclamation that
fetched me up on the instant she
had stopped and was pointing toward
the left-hand wall her attitude and
the look upon her face such that i
started and a sudden fear shot
through me

  what on earth can it be i said

 rhodes made no answer he was
moving forward i followed a mo-
ment and he was beside the dromans
his light turned full upon the wall

  look at that bill said he

  i moved to his side and we stood
there gazing for some moments mo-
tionless and silent

  well bill he queried at last
what do you think of that we
are not the first humans to stand in
this spot

  but probably thousands of years
have passed since any human being
stood here and gazed upon that
entrance-went into it i wonder
what it leads to why should men
have cut that passage into the living
rock in such a hoirible place

  the entrance was about four feet
in width by eight in height aboe
it there was some striking sculptur-
ing evidently work of a mystical
character its meaning was an utter
mystery c lihoc  nd me but not 
thought vo our dromn very ti -
tle dust had accumulate i though

i had good reason to believe many
many centuries had passed since that
spot was abandoned to unbroken
blackness and silence

  many were the pictures that came
and went as we stood there and
looked and wondered who had cut
this passage into the living rock in
what lost age of a people now perhaps
lost as well and for what purpose
had they hewn it

  well probably the answer to that
last awaited us there within

 rhodes and i moved over and
peered into the tunnel

  about fifty feet long he ob-
served and evidently it enters an-
other chamber

  we started in but when we had
taken a few steps we stopped and
turned our look to the dromans why
did they stand hesitant with that
strange look in their eyes and upon
their faces even the angel was af-
fected affected by what  the mere
mystery of the place

  i wonder what is the matter with
them i said

    superstitious dread or something
i suppose returned rhodes well
it ill becomes a scientist to let super-
stition stay his steps and so on we
go

  and on we went into the passage
when we were nearly through it i
glanced back the dromans had not
moved

    look here   said i coming to an
abrupt stop

  what is it now bill

  maybe this is a trap

    a trap  how can it be a trap   

 how on earth do i know that
but to me the whole business has a
queer and suspicious look i tell
you

 how so

 how so why maybe they
brought us to this hole we dont
know what v there maybe they
do maybe vhey arent lost at all
why didnt they come in too what
drome



are they standing out there for
standing and waiting-waiting for
what probably for their chance to
steal away and leave us to our fate
my gosh bill said milton
your imagination goes like a jump-
ing-jack  

  heaven help us if thats what
you think when a man would be cau-
tious and watchful  

  cautious and watchful yes
certainly we want to be cautious and
watchful after all there may be
something in what you say but not
much i think no bill this is not
a trap there is no faking about it
they are lost

  i dont like it i told him
why wont they come in

   goodness knows bill why wont
some people sit down to the table if
the party numbers thirteen and
why should ive stand hesitant sup-
pose that they do plan to steal away
from us i dont believe it but sup-
pose that they do what then are
we going to run after them like
lambs after little bo-peep not i
old tillicum if they are as treacher-
ous as that the quicker we part com-
pany the better for sooner or later
their chance would come

  there may be something in that
i admitted lead on macduff

  a second or two and we had
stepped from the passage out into a
great and lofty chamber

  great heaven i cried my right
hand going to my revolver what
is that thing

  rhodes made no answer he stood
peering intently

  look out i cried pulling out
my weapon and drawing back to-
ward the entrance its moving

       chapter 
       the monster

rhodes made no response still he
stood there peering toward the
end of the chamber then of a sud-

den to my inexpressible surprize and
horror he began moving forward-
moving toward that monstrous thing
which reared itself up out of the
gloom and the shadows up and up
almost to the very roof itself

   what are you doing i cricd
 i tell you i saw it move

   rhodes paused but he did not
 look back

   it didnt move he said how
 coidd it move it must have been
 only the shadows that you saw bill

      shadows  

   just so-shadows

   he moved his light slowly back
 and forth

   see that a certain way you
 look at it that thing up there seems
 to be moving instead of the shad-
 ows  

   but what on earth can it be i
 asked slowly advancing to his side
 and what is that white which
 though so faint yet gleams so hor-
 ribly it looks like teeth

   it is teeth said milton whose
 eyes were better than mine but
 the thing of course is not animate
 even though you did think that you
 saw it move it is simply a carven
 monster like the great sphinx of the
 pyramids or the colossi of thebes
 we were moving toward it now
 and look at all those horrors
 along the walls i said dragons
 serpents horrors never seen on land
 in air or in the sea and look there
 there is a demon-i mean a sculp-
 tured demon and thats what the
 colossus itself is-a monstrous ape-
 bat

   not so bill see it is becoming
 plainer and it is unequivocally a
 dragon

yes it was a dragon and a mon-
ster more horrible than this thing bc-
- fore us never had been fashioned by
even the wildest imagination of
artist or madman

   the dragon not carven from the
 rock but made of bronze crouched


weird tales

upon a high rock its wings out-
spread at the base of this rock-
upon which base rested the hind
claws of the monster-was a plat-
form some twenty feet square and
raised five or six feet above the floor
of the cavern in the front and on
either side of this platform there
were steps and in the center of it a
stone of curious shape-a stone that
sent a shudder through me

  and up above rose the colossal
dragon itself its scaly fore claws
gripping the edge of the rock twen-
ty-five feet or so above the platform
the neck curved forward and down
the head hung over the platform
forty feet or more up in the air-the
great jaws wide open the forked
tongue protruding hungrily the huge
teeth and the huge eyes sending back
the rays from our lights in demoni-
acal indescribably horrible gleams

    talk about gorgons chimeras
and hydras dire i exclaimed and
it was as though unseen things phan-
tom beings so eery were the echoes
repeated the words in mockery and
in gloating why should men
create such a gorgonic nightmare
and worship it-worship the monster
of their own creating look at that
stone there in the center of the plat-
form ugh the things that must
have taken place in that spot-the
thought makes the flesh creep and the
blood itself turn cold in ones veins
what a dark and fearsome cav-
ern after all is the skull of man
said milton rhodes a place where
bats flit and blind shapes creep and
crawl  

  i turned toward him with a look of
surprize

  that from the man whom i have
so often heard sing the song of the
mind that from a scientist one who
reveres hipparchus archimedes
galileo newton and darwin from
one who so often has said that the
only wonderful thing about man is

his mind and that that mind in its

possibilities is simply godlike
and so say i again and so shall
i always say in its possibilities
remember but man is a sort of
dual creature a creature that
achieves the impossible by being in
two places at the same time his body
is in this the twentieth century his
mind is still back there in the pleisto-
cene with cave-bears hyenas and
saber-toothed tigers

  i uttered a vehement dissent

  but tis so bill said rhodes
or at least bade there beyond the
year  the world knows but one
newton one archimedes one galileo
one darwin one edison but heaven
has sent the world thousands  

  i dont believe it there are no
mute inglorious-shakespeares  
no there are no mute inglorious
shakespeares no mute inglorious
newtons the world this glorious
mind that we hear so much about de-
stroyed them  

  or said i they destroyed
themselves  

  you are not making the minds
case any the brighter bill by put-
ting it that way yes the mind the
glorious human mind destroyed them
and turned forthwith to grovel in the
dust before monsters like this one
before us-before prejudice ignor-
ance superstition and worse

  what a horrible piece of work
then is man  

  take the average of the human
mind went on milton rhodes not
the exceptions so brilliant and so
wonderful but the average of all the
human minds in all the world today
from our newtons-if we have any
now-to your savage groveling in the
dust before some fetish or idol made
of mud do that and the skull of man
is found to be just what i said-a
dark and fearsome cavern a habitat
for bats and ghostly nameless
things
drome



  what a strange a horrible idea
i exclaimed

  the world is prond of its new-
tons now said rhodes but was
it proud of them when they came
whenever i see a man going into ec-
stasy over the wonders of the beau-
ties and the glories of the human
mind i think of these words written
by the philosopher of ferney when
we reflect that newton locke clarke
and leibnitz would have been perse-
cuted in france imprisoned at rome
and burned at lisbon what are we to
think of human reason   

  alas poor poor humans said
i you are only vile yahoos

  milton rhodes smiled wanly

  dont misunderstand me bill
the mind of man is a fearful thing
but it is wonderful too as wonderful
as it is dreadful-and the more won-
derful perhaps than it intrinsically
is because of the very grossness and
sordidness that it has to conquer we
are prone some of us to think the
record of the intellect a shabby one
but after all the record is not all
things considered so bad as it may
seem at a first glance it might have
been better but we should rejoice
that it is not worse that the mind
the hope of the world has made even
the slight advance that it has mind
is on his way at last and with sci-
ence on his right hand and invention
on his left he can not fail to conquer
the ape and the tiger-to win to a
future brighter even than the most
beautiful of our brightest dreams

  well said i turning and seat-
ing myself on one of the steps up
which steps perhaps many victims
had been dragged to sacrifice this
is a fine time truly and a fine place
indeed in which to discuss man and
the glorious destiny that may await
him in view of the fact that some
spot in these cursed caverns may soon
be our tomb

  and i added there come the
dromans

  never shall i forget that look of
awe and horror upon their white
faces when at last they stood there in
a huddled group before almost un-
der the great dragon rhodes had
seated himself beside me and it was
obvious that this temerity on our
part was a source of astonishment to
the dromans what dread powers
they feared the monster might pos-
sess i can only conjecture but i do
know that we could never have in-
duced even drorathusa herself to
thus on the very steps of his altar
hazard the wrath of an offended
deity

chapter 

i abandon hope

at last milton and i arose and pro-
ceeded to examine carefully this
chamber of carven horrors by the
altar another passage was discov-
ered like the great chamber itself
and the passage by which we had en-
tered this tunnel had been hewn out
of the living rock by the hand of man
it was some sixty feet in length and
conducted us into a small but most
remarkable grotto-or rather a se-
ries of grottoes we advanced how-
ever but a little way there a few
minutes and we were again in the
hall of the dragon

  we continued and finished our
examination of the place another
passage was discovered in the roof
and leading to we knew not where
then there were those stone horrors
ranged along either wall but i shall
not attempt to describe those night-
mare monstrosities some of which by
the way had two heads

  	the chevalier dangos a learned astronomer
carefully observed for several days a lizard with
two heads and assured himself that this lizard
had two wills independent of each other and
possessing nearly equal power over the body
which was in one when a piece of bread was
presented to the animal in such a manner that
it could see it with one head only that head
wished to go toward the bread while the other
head wished the body to remain still-voltaire


weird tales

  the dromans had drawn back some
distance from the altar and all had
sunk down to a seat upon the floor
all save drorathusa

  our examination ended we moved
toward the little group milton looked
at his watch

  midnight said he

  as we drew near drorathusa sud-
denly raised a hand and made a sig-
nificant motion toward the entrance
those seated rose from the floor with
an alacrity that astonished me evi-
dently they were very anxious to quit
this chamber of horrors i was not
sorry to do so myself

  shades of the great ulysses
said i as we moved along in the rear
are we going to keep up this wan-
dering until we drop

  just what i was wondering my-
self bill i fancy though that our
dromans are beginning to think that
a rest would not be inexpedient
shortly after issuing from the pas-
sage the party came to a halt and
drorathusa to my profound thank-
fulness announced that the time for
rest and sleep had come

  sleep said i to myself who
can sleep in such a place and at such
a time

 from his pack narkus took a
small silklike bundle like the tent
that captain amundsen left at the
south pole one could have put it in-
to a fair-sized pocket the white-
haired girl handed narkus the sort of
alpenstock which she carried and lo
and presto there was a tent for the
ladies

  rhodes and i betook ourselves off
to a hollow in the wall where we
halted and disposed ourselves for
rest this disposition however was
a very simple affair we simply re-
moved our packs and sat down on the
floor-the softness of which by no
means vied with that of swans-down

  i drank a little water but it
seemed to augment rather than as-
suage my burning thirst for a time i

sat there my aching body leaning
back against the rock wall my
fevered tortured mind revolving the
grisly possibilities that confronted
us meditation however only served
to make our situation the more ap-
palling with an exclamation of de-
spair i lay down longing for sleeps
sweet oblivion at this moment nar-
kus and the young man-whose name
by the way was thumbra-were seen
approaching they laid themselves
down near by their lanterns extin-
guished we had shut off the electric
lights but our phosphorus-lamps and
those of the dromans shed their pale
and ghostly light around

  rhodes was sitting up engaged in
bringing his journal forward as care-
fully and coolly as though he were in
his library at home instead of in this
mysterious and fearful abode of
blackness and silence thousands of
feet below the surface of the earth
far-though how far we could only
guess-below the level of the sea it-
self

  when i closed my eyes pictures
came and went in a stream-pictures
swaying flashing fading the amaz-
ing the incredible things that had
happened the things that probably
were to happen-oh was it all only
a dream

  i opened my eyes and raised my-
self up on an elbow i saw milton
rhodes bent over his book writing
writing i saw the recumbent forms
of the two dromans whose heavy
breathing told me that already they
slept over there was the tent in it
the beautiful the sibylline drora-
thusa and her lovely companions-
and i knew alas that it was not a
dream

  i sank back with an inward groan
and closed my eyes again oh those
thoughts that came thronging if i
could only go to sleep a vision of
treachery came but it was not to
trouble me now no rhodes was
right our dromans were lost if
drome



only those other visions could be as
easily banished as that one

  ere long however those thronging
thoughts and visions became hazy
confused began to fade and then
suddenly thfcy were blended with the
monsters and the horrors of dreams

  it was  oclock when i awoke
rhodes was sitting up he had he
told me just awakened one of the
dromans was stirring in his sleep and
muttering something in cavernous
and horrible tones as i sat there
and listened a chill passed through
me so terrible were the sounds

  i cant stand that i exclaimed
im going to wake him up its
time we were moving anyway  
yes nodded milton surely
though well find water today
today where is your day in
this place its night eternal and
for us im afraid it is good-night
with a vengeance  

  ere long we were again under way
my canteen was now as dry as a bone
and i felt mighty sad however
since i could not banish them i en-
deavored to mask those dark and dire
forebodings when we set forth it
was with the hope that we might find
and be conducted by it to safety the
road by which those old worshipers
had journeyed to and from that hall
of the dragon but not a vestige of
such a route could we discover

  hours passed on and on we went
deeper and deeper noon came no
change no one had a drop of water
now rhodes and i estimated the
distance traveled since quitting the
temple of the dragon at ten miles and
the descent at something like four
thousand feet this estimate or
rather guess may however have been
wide of the truth we still were in-
volved in the maddening intricacies
of the labyrinth

  i confess that our situation began
to assume an aspect that made my
very soul turn sick and cold rhodes
however-divining perhaps what was

in my mind-pointed out that we had
not been lost very long and that sure-
ly we would find water some place
a man said he in the equable tem-
perature of this subterranean world
could live for quite a time without
water i had no doubt that a man
could-if he were lying in bed but
we were not doing that we were in
constant motion the arduous exer-
cise that we were undergoing our
fatigue the anxieties and fears that
preyed upon the mind-each was con-
tributing its quota to the dire and
steady work of enervation

  no i would fight against despair
but certainly i could imbibe no con-
solation no strength either mental or
physical from a deliberate blinking
of facts and one of the facts was
that unless we soon found water
ours would be that fate which has
overtaken so many of those who have
gone forth to search out the secrets
of mysterious places

jpvuring that halt for lunch-and
what an awful lunch that was
-milton brought forward his jour-
nal and drorathusa by means of
pictures drawn in the book made it
clear to us that they would never
have missed the route had it not been
for the lovs of their beloved demon
that of course made rhodes and me
very sorry but if the demon had not
been killed we certainly should have
been even more sorry-and im
afraid in a worse place than this in
which we now found ourselves

  this strange intelligence too re-
minded me of grandfather scran-
tons wonder as to how his angel
and her demon had journeyed over
rock snowfield and glacier to the
tamahnowis rocks through that
dense blinding vapor i understood
that now-they were guided by the
wonderful instinct of the ape-bat
how truly wonderful that instinct
is we were yet to learn little won-
der that drorathusa mourned the


weird

tales

loss of her dear beloved and hideous
demon

  the bat has in all ages been the
personification of repulsiveness
gloom and horror and yet it is in
many ways a very wonderful crea-
ture for instance it can fly through
intricate passages with ease and cer-
titude when blinded avoiding any
obstacle in or across its way as though
in possession of perfect vision no
marvel therefore that some scien-
tists have declared that the bat must
possess a sixth sense the accepted
explanation however is that the
creature discovers the objects in the
words of cuvier by the sole diver-
sity of aerial impressions

  however that may be this wonder-
ful faculty is possessed by the great
ape-bats of drome not that it is for
this that they are valued by the
dromans it is because it is impos-
sible for an ape-bat to get lost it
matters not how long how devious
how broken savage mysterious the
way the demon is never uncertain
for one single moment and a
singular feature of this most singu-
lar fact is that the creature does not
have to retrace the route itself and
it does not matter what time has
elapsed it may be a month years
it is all the same to the demon he
may return to the point of departure
by the outward trail or he may go
back in a bee-line or in a line as
closely resembling a bee-line as the
circumstances will permit

  from this it may easily be inferred
how greatly the dromans value these
dreadful repulsive creatures when
venturing out into the lands of
shadows or into the caverns of ut-
ter darkness these beasts are simply
invaluable in the lands of shad-
ows   they never fail to give warning
of the approach of the wild ape-bats
those wolves of the air or of other
monsters whilst in the dark caverns
-into which the wild bats sometimes
wander for considerable distances-a

man though he may be utterly lost
himself knows that his demon will
guide him safely back to the world of
light

  in other ways however save as
veritable cerberi they are of little
use are indeed objects of distrust
and not a little dread for they are
as a rule of a most savage and uncer-
tain temper not that the owner
fears attack upon himself though
instances are not wanting in which
master or mistress has been set upon
to its owner a demon is truly dog-
like but other people had better be
careful

    since the loss of a demon on such
a journey as this may spell disaster
i wonder i said why they didnt
bring along more than one

  food bill food returned
rhodes i am no authority of
course on demonian dietetics but i
dont imagine that they feed the
monster on canary-bird seed  

  on we went blindly and in des-
peration on and on and deeper and
deeper into the earth at length
there was a change whether for good
or ill we could not know but we
welcomed it nevertheless - simply
because it was a change at last we
were emerging from the labyrinth
but what lay ahead

  yes soon we were no longer in a
maze of caverns grottoes passages
but in a wide and lofty tunnel we
had made our way down it but a lit-
tle distance when an inscription was
discovered on the right-hand wall
the discovery was made by rhodes
who happened to be in the rear a
rectangular space perhaps three feet
by six had been hewn perfectly
smooth and upon this rock tablet
were many chiseled characters char-
acters utterly unlike any we had seen
before this spot we clustered in hope
and questioning it was at once pat-
ent however that our dromans could
make nothing whatever of the writ-
ing but we regarded this discovery
drome



as a happy augury and pressed on
with a lighter step on to bitter dis-
appointment

  hours passed we were still toil-
ing down that awful tunnel

  at last-it was then  ocloek-the
way became very difficult the rock
had been broken rent smashed by
some terrible convulsion the scene
was indescribably weird and savage
and there we halted sank down up-
on the rocky floor rhodes and
drorathusa evinced an admirable
nonchalance but in the eyes of the
others burned the dull light of de-
spair and perhaps too in my own
i tried to hide it but i could not dis-
guise it from myself-the numbing
maddening fact that i had abandoned
hope

  for a time i lay watching rhodes
who was writing writing in his jour-
nal how could he do it who could
ever find the record at any rate
even though found it could never be
read for the finder would be a dro-
man it made me angry to see a man
doing a thing so absurd but i
bridled speech curbed that rising and
insensate anger of mine rolled over
closed my eyes and strange to say
was soon asleep

  but that sleep of mine was an un-
broken succession of horrors-hor-
rors at last ended by an awakening
as horrible

 once more i was in that hewn
chamber once more i stood before the
great dragon but we had been
wrong the monster was alive down
he sprang as i turned to flee sank his
teeth into my shoulder raised his
head high into the air and shook me
as a cat shakes a mouse then sud-
denly i knew that it was not all a
dream

  teeth had sunk into my shoulder
i struggled madly but the jaws only
closed the harder and horror of
horrors the spot in which i had iain
down was now in utter blackness
then i was wide-awake the teeth

 were rhodes  fingers and i heard his
 voice above me in the darkness

 not a word bill-unless guard-
 ed

 what is it i whispered sitting
 up and where are our phos-
 phorus-lamps  

 in their cylinders was rhodes
 low answer we want to see with-
 out being seen that is why i can
 turn on the electric of  at any
 instant i wish the dromans had
 been nearer on this side of that rock
 mass i would have darkened theirs
 too

 without being seen i queried
 in heavens name milton what
 does it mean

 i dont know got your revolver
 handy  

 yes

 good keep it so

 but what is it

 did you said he notice that
 passage in the opposite wall a few
 yards back

 i whispered that i had

well said milton rhodes
there is something in there and
its coming this way

chapter 

the ghost

 sxe waited listening intently

the piaee was as silent as

 the tomb

what i asked did you
hear

 i have no idea bill what it is
 what were the sounds like

 i dont know

 were they loud or faint

   faint-mysterious  

great heaven said i what
can it be how long since you first
heard it

only a few minutes i cant
imagine why the sounds have ceased
i wonder if it has discovered our
presence  


weird tales

  hadnt we better wake the dro-
mans

  i see no necessity for it when
the thing comes-and it was coming
i know-they may be awakened sud-
denly enough the men are farther
from the passage than we are the
ladies farther still it must pass us
before it can reach them and we
have our revolvers

  yes we have our revolvers but
we dont know whats coming
there rhodes exclaimed his
voice a whisper well soon know
did you hear that

  i heard it and there it is again
  its coming bill

  it was coming what were we to
see issue from that passage i
gripped my revolver and waited in a
suspense that was simply agonizing
the sound ceased-came again it
was a pad-pad and once or twice an-
other sound was heard-as though
produced by something brushing
along the wall

  look i said crouching for-
ward light

  the rays grew stronger casting
long shadows - shadows swaying
shaking crawling then of a sudden
the light itself appeared and a tall
figure came gliding out of the pas-
sage

  drorathusa exclaimed milton
rhodes

  this sudden lurch from agonized
suspense and gorgonic imagination
to glad reality left me for some sec-
onds speechless

 well well laughed milton
rhodes pressing the button and
flooding the place with light isnt
imagination a wonderful thing   
but said i what on earth
does this mean

  look there bill look cried
rhodes   look at that  

  drorathusa was moving straight
toward us a strange smile on that
sibylline face of hers

 what do you mean

  the canteen look at her can-
teen milton cried pointing ex-
citedly

  drorathusa stopped and raised the
canteen which was incased in can-
vaslike stuff it was wet-yes wet
and dripping

  water i cried springing up
and rushing toward her

  narranawnzee said drorathu-
sa reaching the canteen toward my
clutching fingers

  great pluvius how i did drink
id be drinking yet if rhodes hadnt
seized the vessel and wrested it from
me

  you must be careful said he
we mustnt drink too much at
first

  and he raised the canteen forth-
with and proceeded to swallow a
couple of quarts

  for heavens sake i told him
leave some for the others

  yes said rhodes handing the
water to drorathusa we have been
kind of ungallant bill-hoggish
but i was as dry as a burnt cork  

  ere he had ceased speaking drora-
thusa was moving toward her com-
panions how wonderful was that
change that rush from out the black
depths of despair and yet our situ-
ation was still truly a terrible one
for we were lost but we did not
think of that water water we
had water now and we rejoiced as
though we had been caught up and
set down in the loveliest of all the
lovely glades of paradise

  a few minutes and we all with
tent and packs were following
drorathusa through the passage
were hurrying toward the stream or
pool that she had discovered what
whim what freak of strange chance
had led that mysterious woman forth
whilst others slept the sleep of de-
spair forth into that particular pas-
sage even now i do not know the
answer
drome



  after following its sinuosities for
several hundred feet we suddenly
stepped out of the passage and into a
great chamber this like our sleep-
ing place was weird and savage in
the extreme broken rock masses
rose up in all directions there were
distorted pyramids fantastic pin-
nacles spires obelisks-even pillars
but they were pillars grotesque and
awful as though seen in a dream

  wider and wider grew the place
more and more broken and savage
soon even the walls were involved in
darkness the roof as we advanced
became more and more lofty clear-
ly this cavern was one of enormous
extent i began to glance about with
some apprehension how had drora-
thusa found her way into such a
place-and out again i marveled
that she had not got lost but she
had not and evidently there was no
likelihood that that could happen
she was moving forward into that
place of savage confusion with never
a sign of hesitation with the certi-
tude of one following a well-beaten
path

  suddenly drorathusa stopped and
after making a sign of silence she
said pointing into the blackness be-
fore us narranawnzee

  narranawanzee yes there it was
the faint murmur and tinkle of
water

  we hurried forward the wall of
the cavern merging from out the
darkness and there it was a large
spring of the purest coolest water
gushing out from the base of the rock
to fall in a gentle cascade and then
flow away to a great pool gleaming
dark and sullen in the feeble rays
that found their way to it

tt was near  oclock of the day
following when we left that spot
rhodes and i were smooth-shaven
again yes he had brought along a
razor-one of your old-fashioned

antediluvian scrapers narkus and
thumbra too had gladly availed
themselves of this opportunity to get
rid of their beards which however
they had kept trimmed close with
clippers your droman has a horror
of mustaches beard or whiskers as
for the ladies they were now radi-
ant and lovely as dians

  we were following the stream an
hour passed another we had ad-
vanced five miles or so and had de-
scended probably half a thousand
feet and then we lost our guide
the stream flowed into a cleft in the
rock to burst forth again perhaps
far far down in some black cavern
that has never known and indeed
never may know the tread of any
human foot

  for some minutes we lingered there
as though reluctant to quit the spot
and then with a last lingering look
at those pellucid waters flashing
dark and sullen however as the light
moved from them we pressed grimly
on and soon were involved in a cav-
ern so rugged and smashed that we
actually began to despair of ever
getting through it but we did get
through to step suddenly out into a
place as smooth almost as a floor
the slope was a gentle one and we
pressed forward at a rapid rate

  we had gone perhaps a mile and a
half when rhodes who was walking
in advance with drorathusa abrupt-
ly halted cried out and pointed

  something white was dimly visible
off in the darkness we moved to-
ward it the dromans evincing a
tense excitement a cry broke from
them and they made a rush forward

  it was a mark upon the wall a
mark which they themselves had
placed there we had found the
way to drome

 and let us hope said i to
rhodes in the midst of the rejoicing
that we dont lose it again


weird tales

  drorathusa turned her look upon
rhodes and me and pointed down the
cavern

   narranawnzee she said

 we understood that and took a
drink upon it

  again drorathusa pointed

  drome said she

  that too we understood-that is
we thought we knew what she meant
by drome

  it was a few minutes past  p m
when we reached the narranawnzee
a fine deep pool without any discover-
able inlet or outlet and there we
halted for the night

  in this spot the dromans had left
a food-depot and right glad were we
to see this accession to the larder
there was also a supply of oil

  that evening i find it convenient
to use these inaccurate terms i
fished out my journal and carefully
brought it forward up to the hour
to the very minute i felt blithe as
a lark and so indeed did everybody
else everybody save drorathusa and
even she was somberly happy i
thought that our troubles were over

  of a sudden rhodes slapped down
his journal and to the surprize of the
dromans and forsooth to my own
made a dive at an oil-container which
narkus had just emptied

 at last-our depth bill he
cried

  and he proceeded to ascertain the
boiling point of water the heat being
furnished by drorathusas lamp and
that of siris the older of the young
women delphis by the way was
the name of the other the white-
haired girl

  it was a strange a striking picture
truly-milton rhodes bending over
his improvised hypogemeter the
dromans looking on with curiosity
perplexity and strange questionings
in their looks

  at last rhodes was satisfied with
the result that it was as near accu-
racy as the circumstances would per-
mit

  we are said he after computing
for some moments in his journal at
a depth of a little more than twelve
thousand feet the exact figures are
 feet-though we can not of
course claim for our determination
any high degree of accuracy i feel
confident however that it is near the
truth call it twelve thousand feet
  twelve thousand feet below the
level of the sea   

  yes bill below the level of the
sea

  great erebus i knew that we had
descended a long way but i would
never have believed that we had gone
down over two miles two miles be-
low sea-level that is a record-
smasher  

  rather milton smiled be-
fore us no man of our sunlit world
had penetrated into the crust of the
earth to a greater depth than 
feet below the level of the sea that
is the depth of the mine at st john
del rey minas geraes brazil
two miles-over two miles
down said i

  and probably we are only start-
ed

  but the pressure we cant go
down very far into this steadily in-
creasing pressure increasing in a
geometrical ratio whilst the depth in-
creases only in an arithmetical one
but milton said i showed
you that there is something wrong
with the law

  then how do you know that we
have reached a depth of twelve thou-
sand feet and over-if the law breaks
down   

  i dont believe that it has broken
down yet it will hold good for this
slight descent which we have made
and of course if fact is found to
drome



coincide with theory then our de-
scent will be arrested at no great
depth

  and i said unless the dis-
crepancy between fact and theory is
a remarkable one we will have no
means of knowing whether the law
has broken down or not  

  we shall have no means of know-
ing bill-unless as you say truth
and theory are remarkably divergent
of course in that case we should not
long remain unaware of the fact of
the depth then we can not be cer-
tain but the boiling point will al-
ways give us the atmospheric pres-
sure  

  that isnt what is worrying me
i told him it is the pressure itself 

  the pressure itself milton re-
turned would produce no dire ef-
fects it is not the diminution of
pressure that produces the dreaded
mountain sickness as was clearly
shown by dr paul bert of edu-
cated people nine hundred and nine-
ty-nine out of every thousand will
tell you that the acceleration of the
pulse as one ascends to lofty heights
the short troubled breathing the dis-
ordered vision extreme weakness
nausea vertigo bleeding at nose and
lungs in short all the symptoms of
the terrible mal des montagnes are
caused by the diminution of the at-
mospheric pressure the average
human being-such is their explana-
tion-having a surface of about
fifteen square feet sustains an at-
mospheric pressure of more than
thirty thousand pounds at an ele-
vation of eighteen thousand feet the
pressure is but one-half of that is it
any wonder then that a man gets
mountain sickness

  shades of ten thousand gulli-
vers i exclaimed do you mean to
say that those nine hundred and
ninety-nine are wrong   

  certainly they are wrong so
wrong as to cause dr bert to write

it is amazing to find a theory so
plainly at variance with elementary
physical laws accepted by eminent
men 

  well well was my sage re-
mark i suppose the next thing on
the program will be the statement
that it is not the fire that makes the
pot boil it is the heat

  if it doesnt rain bill tomorrow
will be monday however dr bert
professor in the paris faculty of
sciences proved that the lessening
of the barometric pressure  to use his
own words is of no account mechan-
ically in the production of the
phenomena yes he proved that to
use his own words again it is not
the  lowering of mechanical pressure
that produces the symptoms but the
low tension of the oxygen of the di-
lated air which low tension prevents
the oxygen from entering the blood
in sufficient quantity dr bert not
only experimented on sparrows but
entered the air-chamber himself as
the pressure was reduced he experi-
enced all the symptoms of mountain
sickness but he says all these
symptoms disappeared as by en-
chantment as soon as i respired some
of the oxygen in the bag returning
however when i again breathed the
air of the cylinder

  in one of his experiments the
pressure was reduced to  milli-
meters- inches this he says
is exactly the pressure on the high-
est summit of the himalayas-the
same degree of pressure which was
so near proving fatal to glaisher and
coxwell i reached this point without
the slightest sense of discomfort or
to speak more accurately the un-
pleasant sensations i felt at the be-
ginning had entirely disappeared a
bird in the cylinder with me was lean-
ing on one side and vary sick it
was my wish to continue the experi-
ment till the bird died but the stenm-
pump conspiring as i suspect with


weird tales

the people who were watching me
through glass peep-holes would not
work and so i had to return to nor-
mal pressure

     so you see bill it is the low ten-
sion of the oxygen and not the dim-
inished pressure that produces the
distress and suffering and even
death

  all this is very interesting but
our problem is not one of rarefied
air the atmosphere here is com-
pressed

  and in compressed air said
milton rhodes it is the oxygen
again that produces the symptoms
subject a sparrow to a pressure of
twenty atmospheres and the bird is
thrown into convulsions stronger
than those produced by tetanus or
strychnin convulsions which soon
end in death if pure oxygen is
used a pressure of only five atmos-
pheres kills the sparrow but-and
mark this-if the air be deficient in
oxygen the pressure of twenty at-
mospheres does not produce even a
tremor so you see bill he con-
cluded we could descend to a very
great depth in an atmosphere poor in
oxygen

    but how do we know that the at-
mosphere down there is poor in oxy-
gen it may be nothing of the kind
it may be saturated with it

  of course we dont know all
we know is that we know nothing
and that reminds me of socrates
that is what he said-that all he
knew was that he didnt know any-
thing arcesilaus declared that
socrates didnt even know that
however hope is as cheap as despair
and remember here are our hypo-
geans they can ascend to our
world to a height of eight thousand
feet above the level of the sea and
that so far as we know without suf-
fering the slightest inconvenience

  something queer about that
was my comment

  it is queer bill however we
know that they can live in the to
them rarefied air of our world why
then think that conditions down
there whether five miles down or
fifty miles will prove fatal to us

vn the following morning we
 were under way at an early hour
the route led down a great tunnel
we could not have got lost now if we
had tried shortly before noon the
welcome sounds of narranawnzee
were heard and there was a large
stream gushing out of the wall at
times as we advanced the stream
would move along dreamy and silent
then it would be seen rushing and
glancing and again growling and
foaming in lovely cascades

  steadily save for the noon halt
we toiled our onward and downward
way it was half past  when we
halted-the eery silence of the place
broken by the soft musical murmur-
ing of the narranawnzee again
rhodes ascertained the boiling-point
of water it was  fahrenheit
we were therefore under a pressure
of two atmospheres we had reached
the depth of  feet in other
words we were three miles and a half
below the level of the sea

  it seems strange that i awoke for
i was dreaming the loveliest dream-
a dream of fairy landscapes birds
and flowers with lovely cinderella
in the midst of them nor do i know
why i turned over onto my right
side for i was very comfortable as
it was but turn i did and i was
just going to close my eyes to return
to the dreamland of the fairies but

i	did not close them instead my
heart gave a wild leap and i opened
them wide the next instant i was
sitting up straining my eyes as i
drome



looked into the darkness fear had
its grip upon me and i felt my hair
begin to stand on end

  for there was something in that
blackness something visible-mov-
ing

  scarcely had my eyes fallen upon
this amorphous ghostly thing when
it rose into the air slowly and with-
out the faintest sound up it rose
and up whilst i sat watching im-

when lazarus left the grave
where for three days and
three nights he had been un-
der the enigmatical sway of death
and returned alive to his dwelling
for a long time no one noticed in him
those sinister things which made his
name a terror as time went on glad-
dened by the sight of him who had
been returned to life those near to
him made much of him and satisfied
their burning desire to serve him in
solictude for his food and drink and
garments they dressed him gor-
geously and when like a bridegroom
in his bridal clothes he sat again
among them at the table and ate and
drank they wept with tenderness
and they summoned the neighbors
to look at him who had risen miracu-
lously from the dead these came
and shared the joy of the hosts
strangers from far-off towns and
hamlets came and adored the miracle

   	translated from the russian

movable speechless as though in the
clutch of some uncanny charm

 up up to the very roof of the
cavern of a sudden there was a
fearful change in its form then the
ghost now of monstrous shape was
coming down-coming down straight
toward me

  fantastic adventures terrific dancers strange
and horrible monsters loopmukcs and goorugrons
make the next installment of drome one of
eery thrills and shivery fascination

in tempestuous words the house of
mary and martha was like a bee-
hive

  whatever was found new in laza-
rus face and gestures was thought to
be some trace of a grave illness and
of the shocks recently experienced
evidently the destruction wrought
by death on the corpse was only ar-
rested by the miraculous power but
its effects were still apparent and
what death had succeeded in doing
with lazarus face and body was like
an artists unfinished sketch seen un-
der thin glass on lazarus temples
under his eyes and in the hollows of
his cheeks lay a deep and cadaverous
blueness cadaverously blue also were
his long fingers and around his fin-
ger-nails grown long in the grave
the blue had become purple and dark
on his lips swollen in the grave the
skin had burst in places and thin
reddish cracks were formed shining
as though covered with transparent

weird tales

mica and he had grown stout his
body puffed up in the grave retained
its monstrous size and showed those
frightful swellings in which one
sensed the presence of the rank liquid
of decomposition but the heavy
corpselike odor which penetrated
lazarus grave-clothes and it seemed
his very body soon entirely disap-
peared the blue spots on his face and
hands grew paler and the reddish
cracks closed up although they never
disappeared altogether that is how
lazarus looked when he appeared
before people in his second life but
his face looked natural to those who
had seen him in the coffin

  in addition to the changes in his
appearance lazarus temper seemed
to have undergone a transformation
but this circumstance startled no one
and attracted no attention before
his death lazarus had always been
cheerful and carefree fond of laugh-
ter and a merry joke it was because
of this brightness and cheerfulness
with not a touch of malice and dark-
ness that the master had grown so
fond of him but now lazarus had
grown grave and taciturn he never
jested nor responded with laughter
to other peoples jokes and the
words which he very infrequently
uttered were the plainest most or-
dinary and necessary words as de-
prived of depth and significance as
those sounds with which animals ex-
press pain and pleasure thirst and
hunger they were the words that
one can say all ones life and yet
they give no indication of what pains
and gladdens the depths of the soul

  thus with the face of a corpse
which for three days had been under
the heavy sway of death dark and
taciturn already appallingly trans-
formed but still unrecognized by
anyone in his nev self he was sit-
ting at the feast-table among friends
and relatives and his gorgeous nup-
tial garments glittered with yellow
gold and bloody scarlet broad waves

of jubilation now soft now tempes-
tuously sonorous surged around him
warm glances of love were reaching
out for his face still cold with the
coldness of the grave and a friends
warm palm caressed his blue heavy
hand music played-the tympanum
and the pipe the cithara and the
harp it was as though bees hummed
grasshoppers chirped and birds war-
bled over the happy house of mary
and martha



one of the guests incautiously lift-
ed the veil by a thoughtless
word he broke the serene charm and
uncovered the truth in all its naked
ugliness ere the thought formed it-
self in his mind his lips uttered with
a smile why do you not tell us
what happened yonder

  all grew silent startled by the
question it was as if it occurred to
them only now that for three days
lazarus had been dead and they
looked at him anxiously awaiting his
answer but lazarus kept silence

  you do not wish to tell us won-
dered the man  is it so terrible yon-
der

  and again his thought came after
his words had it been otherwise
he would not have asked this ques-
tion which at that very moment op-
pressed his heart with its insuffer-
able horror uneasiness seized all
present and with a feeling of heavy
weariness they awaited lazarus
words but he was sternly and coldly
silent and his eyes were lowered
as if for the first time they noticed
the frightful blueness of his face and
his repulsive obesity on the table
as if forgotten by lazarus rested his
bluish-purple wrist and to this all
eyes turned as if it were from it that
the awaited answer was to come the
musicians were still playing but now
the silence reached them too and
even as water extinguishes scattered
lazarus



embers so were their merry tunes
extinguished in the silence the pipe
grew silent the voices of the sonorous
tympanum and the murmuring harp
died away and as if the strings had
burst the cithara answered with a
tremulous broken note silence

  you do not wish to say repeat-
ed the guest unable to check his
chattering tongue but the stillness
remained unbroken and the bluish-
purple hand rested motionless and
then he stirred slightly and everyone
felt relieved he lifted up his eyes
and lo straightway embracing ev-
erything in one heavy glance fraught
with weariness and horror he looked
at them-lazarus who had arisen
from the dead

  it was the third day since lazarus
had left the grave ever since then
many had experienced the pernicious
power of his eye but neither those
who were crushed by it forever nor
those who found the strength to re-
sist in it the primordial sources of
life which is as mysterious as death
never could they explain the horror
which lay motionless in the depth of
his black pupils lazarus looked
calmly and simply with no desire to
conceal anything but also with no
intention to say anything he looked
coldly as one who is infinitely in-
different to those alive many care-
free people came close to him with-
out noticing him and only later did
they learn with astonishment and
fear who that calm stout man was
that walked slowly by almost touch-
ing them with his gorgeous and
dazzling garments the sun did not
cease shining when lie was looking
nor did the fountain hush its mur-
mur and the sky overhead remained
cloudless and blue but the man
under the spell of his enigmatical
look heard  more the fountain and
saw not the sky overhead some-
times he wept bitterly sometimes he
tore his hair and in frenzy called for
help but more often it came to pass

that apathetically and quietly he be-
gan to die and so he languished
many years before everybodys eyes
wasted away colorless flabby dull
like a tree silently drying up in
a stony soil and of those who
gazed at him the one who wept mad-
ly sometimes felt again the stir of
life the others never

  so you do not wish to tell us what
you have seen yonder    repeated the
man but now his voice was impas-
sive and dull and deadly gray weari-
ness showed in lazarus eyes and
deadly gray weariness covered like
dust all the faces and with dull
amazement the guests stared at
each other and did not understand
wherefore they had gathered here
and sat at the rich table the talk
ceased they thought it was time
to go home but could not over-
come the weariness which glued
their muscles and they kept on sit-
ting there yet apart and torn away
from each other like pale fires scat-
tered over a dark field

  but the musicians were paid to
play and again they took their in-
struments and again tunes full of
studied mirth and studied sorrow
began to flow and to rise they
unfolded the customary melody
but the guests barkened in dull
amazement already they knew not

tionless an unknown horror as
though petrified they were standing
far apart and darkness enveloped
them but in the darkness blazed
brighter and brighter the super-
natural vision of him who for three
days had been under the enigmatical
sway of death for three days had
he been dead thrice had the sun ris-
en and set but he had been dead
children had played streams mur-
mured over pebbles the wayfarer had
lifted up hot dust in the highroad
but he had been dead and now he
is again among them touches them
looks at them and through the black
disks of his pupils as through dark-
ened glass stares the unknowable
yonder



no one was taking care of lazarus
for no friends no relatives were
left to him and the great desert
which encircled the holy city came
near the very threshold of his dwell-
ing and the desert entered his
house and stretched on his couch like
a wife and extinguished the fires no
one was taking care of lazarus one
after the other his sisters-mary and
martha-forsook him for a long
while martha was loth to abandon
him for she knew not who would feed
him and pity him she wept and
prayed but one night when the
wind was roaming in the desert and
with a hissing sound the cypresses
were bending over the roof she
dressed noiselessly and secretly left
the house lazarus probably heard
the door slam it banged against the
side-post under the gusts of the desert
wind but he did not rise to go out
and look at her that was abandon-
ing him all the night long the
cypresses hissed over his head and
plaintively thumped the door letting
in the cold greedy desert

like a leper he was shunned by
everyone and it was proposed to tie

a bell to his neck as is done with
lepers to warn people against sudden
meetings but someone remarked
growing frightfully pale that it
would be too horrible if by night the
moaning of lazarus bell were sud-
denly heard under the windows and
so the project was abandoned

  and since he did not take care of
himself he would probably have
starved to death had not the neigh-
bors brought him food in fear of
something that they sensed but
vaguely the food was brought to
him by children they were not afraid
of lazarus nor did they mock him
with naive cruelty as children are
wont to do with the wretched and
miserable they were indifferent to
him and lazarus answered them
with the same coldness he had no
desire to caress the black little curls
and to look into their innocent shin-
ing eyes given to time and to the
desert his house was crumbling
down and long since had his fam-
ishing goats wandered away to the
neighboring pastures his bridal
garments became threadbare ever
since that happy day when the
musicians played he had worn them
unaware of the difference of the new
and the worn the bright colors
grew dull and faded vicious dogs
and the sharp thorns of the desert
turned the tender fabric into rags

  by day when the merciless sun
slew all things alive and even scor-
pions sought shelter under stones and
writhed there in a mad desire to
sting he sat motionless under the
suns rays his blue face and the un-
couth bushy beard lifted up bathing
in the fiery flood

  when people still talked to him he
was once asked poor lazarus
does it please you to sit thus and to
stare at the sun

  and he had answered yes it
does

  so strong it seemed was the cold
of his three days grave so deep the
lazarus

  

darkness that there was no heat on
earth to warm lazarus nor a splen-
dor that could brighten the darkness
of his eyes that is what came to the
mind of those who spoke to lazarus
and with a sigh they left him

  and when the scarlet flattened
globe would lower lazarus would
set out for the desert and walk
straight toward the sun as if striv-
ing to reach it he always walked
straight toward the sun and those
who tried to follow him and to spy
upon what he was doing at night in
the desert retained in their memory
the black silhouette of a tall stout
man against the red background of
an enormous flattened disk night
pursued them with her horrors and
so they did not learn of lazarus do-
ings in the desert but the vision of
the black on red was forever branded
on their brains just as a beast with
a splinter in its eye furiously rubs its
muzzle with its paws so they too
foolishly rubbed their eyes but what
lazarus had given was indelible and
death alone could efface it

  but there were people who lived
far away who never saw lazarus
and knew of him only by report
with daring curiosity which is
stronger than fear and feeds upon it
with hidden mockery they would
come to lazarus who was sitting in
the sun and enter into conversation
with him by this time lazarus ap-
pearance had changed for the better
and was not so terrible the first
minute they snapped their fingers
and thought of how stupid the in-
habitants of the holy city were but
when the short talk was over and they
started homeward their looks were
such that the inhabitants of the holy
city recognized them at once and
said look there is one more fool
on whom lazarus has set his eye
and they shook their heads regret-
fully and lifted up their arms

  there came brave intrepid war-
riors with tinkling weapons happy

youths came with laughter and song
busy tradesmen jingling their mon-
ey ran in for a moment and
haughty priests leaned their crosiers
against lazarus door and they were
all strangely changed as they came
back the same terrible shadow
swooped down upon their souls and
gave a new appearance to the old
familiar world

  those who still had the desire to
speak expressed their feelings thus

  all things tangible and visible
grew hollow light and transparent
similar to lightsome shadows in the
darkness of night

  for that great darkness which
holds the whole cosmos was dispersed
neither by the sun nor by the moon
and the stars but like an immense
black shroud enveloped the earth
and like a mother embraced it

  it penetrated all the bodies iron
and stone and the particles of the
bodies having lost their ties grew
lonely and it penetrated into the
depth of the particles and the par-
ticles of particles became lonely

  for that great void which en-
circles the cosmos was not filled by
things visible neither by the sun nor
by the moon and the stars but
reigned unrestrained penetrating
everywhere severing body from
body particle from particle

  in the void hollow trees spread
hollow roots threatening a fantastic
fall temples palaces and houses
loomed up and they were hollow and
in the void men moved about rest-
lessly but they were light and hol-
low like shadows

  for time was no more and the
beginning of all things came near
their end the building was still be-
ing built and builders were still
hammering away and its ruins were
already seen and the void in its
place the man was still being bom
but already funeral candles were
burning at his head and now they
were extinguished and there was the
 

weird tales

void in place of the man and of the
funeral candles

  and wrapped by void and dark-
ness the man in despair trembled in
the face of the horror of the infinite
thus spake the men who had still
a desire to speak but surely much
inoie could those have told who
wished not to speak and died in
silence



at that time there lived in rome
a renowned sculptor in clay
marble and bronze he wrought bodies
of gods and men and such was their
beauty that people called them im-
mortal but he himself was discon-
tented and asserted that there was
something even more beautiful that
he could not embody either in marble
or in bronze i have not yet gath-
ered the glimmers of the moon nor
have i my fill of sunshine he was
wont to say   and there is no soul in
my marble no life in my beautiful
bronze and when on moonlight
nights he slowly walked along the
road crossing the black shadows of
cypresses his white tunic glittering
in the moonshine those who met him
would laugh in a friendly way and
say

  are you going to gather moon-
shine aurelius why then did you
not fetch baskets

  and he would answer laughing
and pointing to his eyes

  here are the baskets wherein i
gather the sheen of the moon and the
glimmer of the sun

  and so it was the moon glimmered
in his eyes and the sun sparkled
therein but he could not translate
them into marble and therein lay
the serene tragedy of his life

  he was descended from an ancient
patrician race had a good wife and
children and suffered from no want

  when the obscure rumor about
lazarus reached him he consulted

his wife and friends and undertook
the far journey to judea to see him
who had miraculously risen from the
dead he was somewhat weary in
those days and he hoped that the road
would sharpen his blunted senses
what was said of lazarus did not
frighten him he had pondered much
over death did not like it but he
disliked also those who confused it
with life in this life are life and
beauty thought he beyond is
death and enigmatical and there
is no better thing for a man to do
than to delight in life and in the
beauty of all things living he had
even a vainglorious desire to con-
vince lazarus of the truth of his own
view and restore his soul to life as
his body had been restored this
seemed so much easier because the
rumors shy and strange did not ren-
der the whole truth about lazarus
and but vaguely warned against
something frightful

  lazarus had just risen from the
stone in order to follow the sun which
was setting in the desert when a rich
roman attended by an armed slave
approached him and addressed him
in a sonorous voice lazarus

  and lazarus beheld a superb face
lit with glory and arrayed in fine
clothes and precious stones sparkling
in the sun the red light lent to the
romans face and head the appear-
ance of gleaming bronze that also
lazarus noticed he resumed obedi-
ently his place and lowered his weary
eyes

  yes you are ugly my poor laza-
rus quietly said the roman play-
ing with his golden chain you are
even horrible my poor friend and
death was not lazy that day when
you fell so heedlessly into his hands
but you are stout and as the great
caesar used to say fat people are
not ill-tempered to tell the truth i
dont understand why men fear you
permit me to spend the night in your
lazarus



house the hour is late and i have no
shelter  

  never had anyone asked lazarus
hospitality

     i have no bed   said he

  i am somewhat of a soldier and i
can sleep sitting the roman an-
swered we shall build a fire

  i have no fire

  then we shall have our talk in
the darkness like two friends i
think you will find a bottle of wine
i have no wine

  the roman laughed

  now i see why you are so somber
and dislike your second life no
wine why then we shall do with-
out it there are words that make the
head go round better than the fa-
lernian  

  by a sign he dismissed the slave
and they remained alone and again
the sculptor started speaking but it
was as if together with the setting
sun life had left his words and they
grew pale and hollow as if they
staggered on unsteady feet as if they
slipped and fell down drunk with the
heavy lees of weariness and despair
and black chasms grew up between
the words like far-off hints of the
great void and the great darkness

  now i am your guest and you
will not be unkind to me lazarus  
said he hospitality is the duty
even of those who for three days
were dead three days i was told
you rested in the grave there it
must be cold    and thence comes
your ill habit of going without fire
and wine as to me i like fire it
grows dark here so rapidly    the
lines of your eyebrows and forehead
are quite quite interesting they are
like ruins of strange palaces buried
in ashes after an earthquake but
why do you wear such ugly and queer
garments i have seen bridegrooms
in your country and they wear such
clothes-are they not funny-and
terrible     but are you a bride-
groom   

  the sun had already disappeared
a monstrous black shadow came run-
ning from the east it was as if
gigantic bare feet began rumbling on
the sand and the wind sent a cold
wave along the backbone

  in the darkness you seem still
larger lazarus as if you have grown
stouter in these moments do you
feed on darkness lazarus i would
fain have a little fire-at least a little
fire a little fire i feel somewhat
chilly your nights are so barbarously
cold were it not so dark i should
say that you were looking at me
lazarus yes it seems to me you are
looking    why you are looking
at me i feel it-but there you are
smiling

  night came and filled the air with
heavy blackness

    how well it will be when the sun
will rise tomorrow anew  i am a
great sculptor you know that is how
my friends call me i create yes
that is the word    but i need day-
light i give life to the cold marble
i melt sonorous bronze in fire in
bright hot fire    why did you
touch me with your hand   

  come said lazarus you are
my guest

  they went to the house and a
long night enveloped the earth

 the slave seeing that his master
did not come went to seek him when
the sun was already high in the sky
and he beheld his master side by side
with lazarus in profound silence
they were sitting right under the
dazzling and scorching rays of the
sun and looking upward the slave
began to weep and cried out my
master what has befallen you mas-
ter

  the very same day the sculptor left
for rome on the way aurelius was
pensive and taciturn staring atten-
tively at everything-the men the
ship the sea as if trying to retain
something on the high sea a storm
burst upon them and all through it


weird

tales

aurelius stayed on the deck and
eagerly scanned the seas looming near
and sinking with a dull boom

  at home his friends were fright-
ened at the change which had taken
place in aurelius but he calmed
them saying meaningly i have
found it

  and without changing the dusty
clothes he wore on his journey he fell
to work and the marble obediently
resounded under his sonorous ham-
mer long and eagerly he worked
admitting no one until one morning
he announced that the work was
ready and ordered his friends to be
summoned severe critics and connois-
seurs of art and to meet them he
put on bright and gorgeous garments
that glittered with yellow gold-and
scarlet byssus

 here is my work said he
thoughtfully

  his friends glanced and a shadow
of profound sorrow covered their
faces it was something monstrous
deprived of all the lines and shapes
familiar to the eye but not without a
hint at some new strange image

  on a thin crooked twig or rather
on an ugly likeness of a twig rested
askew a blind ugly shapeless out-
spread mass of something utterly and
inconceivably distorted a mad heap
of wild and bizarre fragments all
feebly and vainly striving to part
from one another and as if by
chance beneath one of the wildly-rent
salients a butterfly was chiseled with
divine skill all airy loveliness del-
icacy and beauty with transparent
wings which seemed to tremble with
an impotent desire to take flight

  wherefore this wonderful butter-
fly aurelius said somebody falter-
ingly

  i know not was the sculptors
answer

  but it was necessary to tell the
truth and one of his friends who
loved him best said firmly this is

ugly my poor friend it must be de-
stroyed give me the hammer 

  and with two strokes he broke the
monstrous man into pieces leaving
only the infinitely delicate butterfly
untouched

  from that time on aurelius creat-
ed nothing with profound indif-
ference he looked at marble and
bronze and on his former divine
works where everlasting beauty rest-
ed with the purpose of arousing
his former fervent passion for work
and awakening his deadened soul his
friends took him to see other artists
beautiful works but he remained in-
different as before and the smile did
not warm up his tightened lips and
only after listening to lengthy talks
about beauty he would retort wearily
and indolently but all this is a
lie

  by day when the sun was shining
he went into his magnificent skilfully
built garden and having found a
place without shadow he exposed his
bare head to the glare and heat
red and white butterflies fluttered
around from the crooked lips of a
drunken satyr water streamed down
with a splash into a marble cistern
but he sat motionless and silent like
a pallid reflection of him who in the
far-off distance at the very gates of
the stony desert sat under the fiery
sun



 nd now it came to pass that the
great deified augustus himself
summoned lazarus the imperial
messengers dressed him gorgeously
in solemn nuptial clothes as if time
had legalized them and he was to
remain until his very death the bride-
groom of an unknown bride it was
as if an old rotting coffin had been
gilded and furnished with new gay
tassels and men all in trim and
bright attire rode after him as if in
bridal procession indeed and those
lazarus



foremost trumpeted loudly bidding
people to clear the way for the em-
perors messengers but lazarus
way was deserted his native land
cursed the hateful name of him who
had miraculously risen from the
dead and people scattered at the
very news of his appalling approach
the solitary voice of the brass trum-
pets sounded in the motionless air
and the wilderness alone responded
with its languid echo

  then lazarus went by sea and
his was the most magnificently ar-
rayed and the most mournful ship
that ever mirrored itself in the azure
waves of the mediterranean sea
many were the travelers aboard but
like a tomb was the ship all silence
and stillness and the despairing
water sobbed at the steep proudly
curved prow all alone sat lazarus
exposing his head to the blaze of the
sun silently listening to the murmur
and splash of the wavelets and afar
seamen and messengers were sitting
a vague group of weary shadows
had the thunder burst and the wind
attacked the red sails the ships
would probably have perished for
none of those aboard had either the
will or the strength to struggle for
life with a supreme effort some
mariners would reach the board and
eagerly scan the blue transparent
deep hoping to see a naiads pink
shoulder flash in the hollow of an
azure wave or a drunken gay centaur
dash along and in frenzy splash the
wave with his hoof but the sea was
like a wilderness and the deep was
dumb and deserted

  with utter indifference lazarus set
his feet on the street of the eternal
city as if all her wealth all the
magnificence of her palaces built by
giants all the resplendence beauty
and music of her refined life were
but the echo of the wind in the wil-
derness the reflection of the desert
quicksand chariots were dashing
and along the streets were moving

crowds of strong fair proud build-
ers of the eternal city and haughty
participants in her life a song
sounded fountains and women
laughed a pearly laughter drunken
philosophers harangued and the
sober listened to them with a smile
hoofs struck the stone pavements
and surrounded by cheerful noise a
stout heavy man was moving a cold
spot of silence and despair and on
his way he sowed disgust anger and
vague gnawing weariness who
dares to be sad in rome  the citizens
wondered indignantly and frowned
in two days the entire city already
knew all about him who had miracu-
lously risen from the dead and
shunned him shyly

  but some daring people there were
who wanted to test their strength
and lazarus obeyed their imprudent
summons kept busy by state af-
fairs the emperor constantly delayed
the reception and seven days did he
who had risen from the dead go
about visiting others

  and lazarus came to a cheerful
epicurean and the host met him
with laughter drink lazarus
drink he shouted would not
augustus laugh to see you drunk

 and half-naked drunken women
laughed and rose petals fell on laza-
rus blue hands but then the epi-
curean looked into lazarus eyes
and his gayety ended forever
drunkard remained he for the rest
of his life never did he drink yet
forever was he drunk but instead
of the gay revery which wine brings
with it frightful dreams began to
haunt him the sole food of his strick-
en spirit day and night he lived in
the poisonous vapors of his night-
mares and death itself was not more
frightful than its raving monstrous
forerunners

  and lazarus came to a youth and
his beloved who loved each other
and were most beautiful in their pas-
sions proudly and strongly embrac-


weird tales

ing his love the youth said with se-
rene regret look at us lazarus
and share our joy is there anything
stronger than love

  and lazarus looked and for the
rest of their life they kept on loving
each other but their passion grew
gloomy and joyless like those funeral
cypresses whose roots feed on the de-
cay of the graves and whose black
summits in a still evening hour seek
in vain to reach the sky thrown by
the unknown forces of life into each
others embraces they mingled tears
with kisses voluptuous pleasures
with pain and they felt themselves
doubly slaves obedient slaves to life
and patient servants of the silent
nothingness ever united ever sev-
ered they blazed like sparks and like
sparks lost themselves in the bound-
less dark

  and lazarus came to a haughty
sage and the sage said to him i
know all the horrors you can reveal
to me is there anything you can
frighten me with

  but before long the sage felt that
the knowledge of horror was far from
being the horror itself and that the
vision of death was not death and
fie felt that wisdom and folly are
aqual before the face of infinity for
infinity knows them not and it van-
ished the dividing-line between
knowledge and ignorance truth and
falsehood top and bottom and the
shapeless thought hung suspended in
che void then the sage clutched his
-tray head and cried out frantically
  i can not think i can not think  
thus under the indifferent glance
for him who miraculously had risen
from the dead perished everything
that asserts life its significance and
joys and it was suggested that it
was dangerous to let him see the em-
peror that it was better to kill him
nd having buried him secretly to
ell the emperor that he had disap-
peared no one knew whither al-
ready swords were being whetted and

youths devoted to the public welfare
prepared for the murder when
augustus ordered lazarus to be
brought before him next morning
thus destroying the cruel plans

  if there was no way of getting rid
of lazarus at least it was possible to
soften the terrible impression his face
produced with this in view skilful
painters barbers and artists were
summoned and all night long they
were busy over lazarus head they
cropped his beard curled it and gave
it a tidy agreeable appearance by
means of paints they concealed the
corpselike blueness of his hands and
face repulsive were the wrinkles of
suffering that furrowed his old face
and they were puttied painted and
smoothed then over the smooth
background wrinkles of good-tem-
pered laughter and pleasant carefree
mirth were skilfully painted with fine
brushes

  lazarus submitted indifferently to
everything that was done to him
soon he was turned into a becoming-
ly stout venerable old man into a
quiet and kind grandfather of nu-
merous offspring it seemed that the
smile with which only a while ago he
was spinning funny yarns was still
lingering on his lips and that in the
comer of his eye serene tenderness
was hiding the companion of old
age but people did not dare change
his nuptial garments and they could
not change his eyes two dark and
frightful glasses through which the
unknowable yonder looked at men



i azarus was not moved by the
 magnificence of the imperial pal-
ace it was as if he saw no difference
between the crumbling house closely
pressed by the desert and the stone
palace solid and fair and indifferent-
ly he passed into it the hard marble
of the floors under his feet grew
similar to the quicksand of the desert
lazarus



and the multitude of richly dressed
and haughty men became like void
air under his glance no one looked
into his face as lazarus passed by
fearing to fall under the appalling
influence of his eyes but when the
sound of his heavy footsteps had
sufficiently died down the courtiers
raised their heads and with fearful
curiosity examined the figure of a
stout tall slightly bent old man who
was slowly penetrating into the very
heart of the imperial palace were
death itself passing it would be
faced with no greater fear for until
then the dead alone knew death and
those alive knew life only-and
there was no bridge between them
but this extraordinary man although
alive knew death and enigmatical
appalling was his cursed knowledge
wo people thought he will
take the life of our great deified
augustus   and then sent curses
after lazarus who meanwhile kept
on advancing into the interior of the
palace

  already did the emperor know
who lazarus was and prepared to
meet him but the monarch was a
brave man and felt his own tre-
mendous unconquerable power and
in his fatal duel with him who had
miraculously risen from the dead he
wanted not to invoke human help
and so he met lazarus face to face

  lift not your eyes upon me
lazarus he ordered i heard
your face is like that of medusa and
turns into stone whomsoever you look
at now i wish to see you and talk
with you before i turn into stone
he added in a tone of kingly jesting
not devoid of fear

  coming close to him he carefully
examined lazarus face and his
strange festal garments and al-
though he had a keen eye he was de-
ceived by his appearance

  so you do not appear terrible
my venerable old man but the worse
for us if horror assumes such a re-

spectable and pleasant air now let
us have a talk  

  augustus sat and questioning
lazarus with his eye as much as with
words started the conversation
why did you not greet me as you
entered   

  lazarus answered indifferently  i
knew not it was necessary  

  are you a christian

  no

  augustus approvingly shook his
head

    that is good i do not like
christians they shake the tree of
life before it is covered with fruit
and disperse its odorous bloom to the
winds but who are you  

  with a visible effort lazarus an-
swered i was dead

  i had heard that but who are
you now

  lazarus was silent but at last re-
peated in a tone of weary apathy
i was dead

  listen to me stranger said the
emperor distinctly and severely giv-
ing utterance to the thought that had
come to him at the beginning my
realm is the realm of life my peo-
ple are of the living not of the dead
you are here one too many i know
not who you are and what you saw
there but if you lie i hate your lies
and if you tell the truth i hate your
truth in my bosom i feel the throb
of life i feel strength in my arm
and my proud thoughts like eagles
pierce the space and yonder in the
shelter of my rule under the protec-
tion of laws created by me people
live and toil and rejoice do you
hear the battle-cry the challenge men
throw into the face of the future   
augustus as if in prayer stretched
forth his arms and exclaimed solemn-
ly be blessed  great and divine
life

  lazarus was silent and with grow-
ing sternness the emperor went on
you are not wanted here miserable
remnant snatched from under


weird

tales

deaths teeth you inspire weariness
and disgust with life like a cater-
pillar in the fields you gloat on the
rich ear of joy and belch out the
drivel of despair and sorrow your
truth is like a rusty sword in the
hands of a nightly murderer and as
a murderer you shall be executed
but before that let me look into your
eyes perchance only cowards are
afraid of them but in the brave they
awake the thirst for strife and vic-
tory  then you shall be rewarded not
executed    now look at me laza-
rus  

  at first it appeared to the deified
augustus that a friend was looking
at him so soft so tenderly fascin-
ating was lazarus glance it prom-
ised not horror but sweet rest and
the infinite seemed to him a tender
mistress a compassionate sister a
mother but stronger and stronger
ijrew its embraces and already the
mouth greedy of hissing kisses inter-
fered with the monarchs breathing
and already to the surface of the soft
tissues of the body came the iron of
the bones and tightened its merciless
circle and unknown fangs blunt and
cold touched his heart and sank in-
to it with slow indolence

  it pains said the deified au-
gustus growing pale but look at
me lazarus look

  it was as if some heavy gates ever
closed were slowly moving apart
and through the growing interstice
the appalling horror of the infinite
poured in slowly and steadily like
two shadows entered the shoreless
void and the unfathomable darkness
they extinguished the sun ravished
the earth from under the feet and the
roof from over the head no more
did the frozen heart ache

  look look lazarus ordered
augustus tottering

  time stood still and the beginning
of each thing grew frightfully near
to its end augustus throne just
erected crumbled down and the void

was already in the place of the throne
and of augustus noiselessly did
rome crumble down and a new city
stood on its site and it too was swal-
lowed by the void like fantastic
giants cities states and countries fell
down and vanished in the void dark-
ness and with uttermost indifference
did the insatiable black womb of the
infinite swallow them

  halt ordered the emperor

  in his voice sounded already a note
of indifference his hands dropped in
languor and in the vain struggle with
the onrushing darkness his fiery eyes
now blazed up and now went out

  my life you have taken from me
lazarus   said he in a spiritless
feeble voice

  and these words of hopelessness
saved him he remembered his peo-
ple whose shield he was destined to
be and keen salutary pain pierced
his deadened heart   they are
doomed to death he thought
wearily   serene shadows in the
darkness of the infinite   thought he
and horror grew upon him frail
vessels with living seething blood
with a heart that knows sorrow and
also great joy said he in his heart
and tenderness pervaded it

  thus pondering and oscillating
between the poles of life and death
he slowly came back to life to find in
its suffering and in its joys a shield
against the darkness of the void and
the horror of the infinite

  no you have not murdered me
lazarus said he firmly but i will
take your life begone

  that evening the deified augustus
partook of his meats and drinks with
particular joy now and then his
lifted hand remained suspended in
the air and a dull glimmer replaced
the bright sheen of his fiery eye it
was the cold wave of horror that
surged at his feet defeated but
not undone ever awaiting its hour
that horror stood at the emperors
bedside like a black shadow all
lazarus



through his life it swayed his nights
but yielded the days to the sorrows
and joys of life

  the following day the hangman
with a hot iron burned out lazarus
eyes then he was sent home the
deified augustus dared not kill him

t azarus returned to the desert
 and the wilderness met him with
hissing gusts of wind and the heat of
the blazing sun again he was sit-
ting on a stone his rough bushy
beard lifted up and the two black
holes in place of his eyes looked at the
sky with an expression of dull terror
afar off the holy city stirred noisily
and restlessly but around him every-
thing was deserted and dumb no
one approached- the place where lived
he who had miraculously risen from
the dead and long since his neigh-
bors had forsaken their houses driv-

en by the hot iron into the depth of
his skull his cursed knowledge hid
there in an ambush as if leaping
out from an ambush it plunged its
thousand invisible eyes into the man
and no one dared look at lazarus

  and in the evening when the sun
reddening and growing wider would
come nearer and nearer the western
horizon the blind lazarus would
slowly follow it he would stumble
against stones and fall stout and
weak as he was would rise heavily to
his feet and walk on again and on
the red screen of the sunset his black
body and outspread hands would
form a monstrous likeness of a cross

  and it came to pass that once he
went out and did not come back
thus seemingly ended the second life
of him who for three days had been
under the enigmatical sway of death
and rose miraculously from the dead

                     so good night with lullaby

	from a midsummer nights dream
we surely started something when we put the question to you the
readers in the eyrie for january shall we continue to use one re-
print story in each issue or do you wish nothing but new stories
the answer is decidedly in favor of a continuance of the reprints-one in
each issue the quotation from peter  dactylles letter in the eyrie of
the same issue has made the edgar allan poe fans writhe and chew up several
lengths of the parlor carpet for the sake of a long-suffering public
wrote mr odactylle please dont print any more of poes tales as they
leave us with a taste in our mouth like a yellow dog if ligeia is his best
then god have pity on his worst  

  please do not ever discontinue the weird story reprint department
writes harvey w flink of centre hall pennsylvania this is the de-
partment in your wonderful magazine that i like best almost every writer
of note has tried his hand at writing a weird tale some of these are medi-
ocre some are very good one of the missions of weird tales is to sort out
the good ones and publish them only in this way can the magazine help us
to become familiar with the worlds best weird fiction i suggest that you
discontinue including poes stories there are many others not as well known
but just as good

  a contrary view is expressed by charles t hamilton of leavenworth
kansas who writes as to the reprints for gods sake stop them they
only take up valuable space that could be used to better advantage and
he adds we have formed a club here in leavenworth called the weird
tales club to discuss the stories in weird tales and in our opinion the
last horror is a wonderful piece of work one of the best if not the best that
colter ever wrote so give it first place in the january issue

  w l mason jr of st louis writes i would like to suggest that in-
stead of having weird story reprints you would have a section in which
readers might exchange weird experiences such as weird dreams etc i think
such a column would find great favor with weird tales readers

  writes carlisle d scott of colfax illinois i have never written to the
eyrie before but when i saw the rap made by a certain gentleman in de-
troit about poes story ligeia i decided to write right away at once imme-
diately if he has read poes stories and does not like them he is perfectly
free to rap for himself but i do not think that he has any license to
make any statement about a suffering public for i am sure that i can find
as many people who do like some of his stories as he can find people who do

the eyrie



not like any of them i am sure that poe was one of the greatest story writers
who ever wrote in english continue the reprints by all means some of the
stories that have made the greatest impression with me have been your re-
prints among the best that you have printed i will mention the tjpper
berth by crawford the mask of the red death by poe and the horla by
guy de maupassant the horla was my introduction to maupassant and
since reading it i have been looking up his works and now have three books
of his short stories in my possession i think the reprints should be con-
tinued because of their great literary value

  a bumard of providence rhode island complains that the december
reprint would not have frightened an elderly spinster-and i am a -year-
old bookworm  think that over remember the war-cry of your readers-
keep them weird i certainly like jules de grandin with that little ex-
planatory i say to me of his i can find but one fault with the january
w t-you do not make your favorite section of your readers ballot large
enough

  writes ernest francis of hampton bays new york i have read your
magazine for almost twelve months and have never had cause to regret it
i write today because of the special enchantment of reading the last hor-
ror by eli colter let me congratulate you on printing that truly marvel-
ous story i like it for its utter magnificence  

  h c newman of san diego california writes to the eyrie two
short years ago i first bought weird tales and ive not missed a copy since
ive taken the magazine to logging camps citizens military training camps
and now i am in the navy everywhere i go your magazine is popular
from the way my buddies grab it after i have read every story i dont
like the star shell for the reason that it is such an interesting story that i
can hardly wait for the installments give us more animal and insect stor-
ies like the city of spiders

  writes lennart larson of seattle your readers have sent letters to
the eyrie saying they want weird tales to stay weird im with them
although i am only thirteen years old i like stories that are different and
imaginative my vote for the best story in weird tales for the last twelve
issues is wolfshead by robert e howard as one of your readers i ask
for more werewolf stories quinn i think is the best of all your authors
charles c hampel of los angeles sends to the eyrie a letter in verse
we are sorry that we have not room to print all of it but a quotation will
give you the gist of the poem

    tales of witchcraft tales of horror

                   tales that make your blood run cold

    tales that fairly chill your marrow

                   tales the weirdest ever told

   in the dead of night i read them

                   jump at every little sound

    in the rustlings and the creakings

                   in my thoughts there ghosts abound

  speaking of good stories writes e hoffmann price author of the pea-
cocks shadow i nominate for the  hall of fame the supreme witch
in the october issue for it combined the weirdness essential to the magazine
with the difficult trick of making the characters human and acting and think-


weird tales

mg like human beings there you have the quintessence of art if the
author can duplicate that feat let him try it but first threaten him with
crucifixion if he tries and fails  

in the january magazine you gave us a modern version of leonora
writes mrs ray e adcock of willcox arizona and adds why not give
us the original legend sometime in the near future in the horror at red
hook the author mentions lilith several times why not give us the full
story or legend of lilith too i know nothing of her except that she was the
lirst wife of adam and i should like to know all about her  

writes grace stiles of minneapolis i think that drome is a thriller i
can hardly wait to receive the next copy the man who wrote that story
must have a master-mind  

give us more poems writes john b woodliouse of washington d c
such poems as the dance of death starkey strang the caves of kooli-
kan grave chains and the ballade of phantom ships are as good as the
stories please cut out the reprint stories they are not as good as the new
stories i am an admirer of your scientific and weird-scientific stories they
are the best the night wire is just about the best story you have published
since i have been reading w t

i have been reading weird tales from the first issue published writes
helmuth b stiller of milwaukee it was always great reading and is be-
coming greater still inasmuch as it adapts itself to the wishes of the readers
in giving them the kind of stories they want the horror at red hook by
h p lovecraft is in my opinion the best in the january issue with the
last horror by eli colter a close second the new serial drome also prom-
ises to be excellent you can never give me too many of lovecrafts yarns
readers your favorite story in the january issue as shown by your bal-
lots was the last horror by eli colter with the new serial drome by john
martin leahy in second place what is your favorite story in the present
issue

the blood-flower



the blood-flower

          continued from page 

ly till it was nearly twice its normal
size her nose seemed lengthening
becoming more pointed and crooking
sharply at the end her eyes of sweet
cornflower blue were widening be-
coming at once round and prominent
and changing to a wicked phosphor-
escent green i stared and stared
unable to believe the evidence of my
eyes and as i looked she raised her
hands from beneath the covers and
i went sick with the horror of it the
dainty flowerlike pink-and-white
hands with their well-manicured nails
were transformed into a pair of
withered corded talons armed with
long hornlike curved claws saber-
sharp and hooked like the nails of
some predatory bird before my eyes
a sweet gently bred woman was be-
ing transfigured into a foul hell-hag
a loathsome hideous parody of her-
self

 quickly friend trowbridge
seize her bind her de grandin
called thrusting a handful of the
limber withes into my grasp and
hurling himself upon the monstrous
thing which lay in edith evanders
place

  the hag fought like a true mem-
ber of the wolf pack howling claw-
ing growling and snarling she op-
posed tooth and nail to our efforts
but at last we lashed her wrists and
ankles firmly with the wooden cords
and bore her struggling frantically
down the stairs and placed her within
the mystic circle de grandin had
drawn on the dining room floor

  inside friend trowbridge quick-
ly the frenchman ordered as he
dipped the hyssop into the boiling
liquid in the kettle and leaped over
the chalk marks mademoiselle os-
trander monsieur evander for your
lives leave the house

  reluctantly the husband and nurse
left us and de grandin began show-
ering the contorting howling thing
on the floor with liquid from the boil-
ing kettle

  swinging his hyssop in the form of
a cross above the hideous change-
lings head he uttered some invoca-
tion so rapidly that i failed to catch
the words then striking the wolf-
womans feet hands heart and head
in turn with his bundle of twigs he
drew forth a small black book and
began reading in a firm clear voice
out of the deep have i called un-
to thee  lord lord hear my
voice 

  and at the end he finished with a
great shout i know that my re-
deemer liveth   i am the resurrec-
tion and the life saith the lord he
that believeth in me though he were
dead yet shall he live

  as the words sounded through the
room it seemed to me that a great
cloud of shadow like a billow of
black vapor rose from the dark cor-
ners of the apartment eddied toward
the circle of lamps swaying their
flames lambently then suddenly gave
back evaporated and disappeared
with a noise like steam escaping from
a boiling kettle

  behold trowbridge my friend
de grandin ordered pointing to the
still figure which lay over the sign
of mercury at his feet

  i bent forward stifling my re-
pugnance then sighed with mingled
relief and surprize calm as a sleep-
ing child edith evander freed from
all the hideous stigmata of the wolf-
people lay before us her slender
hands still bound in the wooden
ropes crossed on her breast her
sweet delicate features as though


weird tales

they had never been disfigured by the
curse of the blood-flower

  loosing the bonds from her wrists
and feet the frenchman picked the
sleeping woman up in his arms and
bore her to her bedroom above stairs

    do you summon her husband and
the nurse my friend he called from
the turn in the stairway she will
have need of both anon

vih-why shes herself again

  vv evander exclaimed joyfully
as he leaned solicitously above his
wifes bed

 but of course de grandin
agreed   the spell of evil was
strong upon her monsieur but the
charm of good was mightier she is
released from her bondage for all
time

  ill have your fee ready tomor-
row evander promised diffidently
i could not arrange the mortgages
today-it was rather short notice you
know

  laughter twinkled in de grandins
little blue eyes like the reflection of
moonlight on flowing water my
friend he replied i did make the
good joke on you last night parbleu
to hear you agree to anything and
to announce that you did trust to
my methods as well was payment
enough for me i want not your
money if you would repay jules
de grandin for his services continue
to love and cherish your wife as you
did last night when you feared you
were about to lose her me morbleu
but i shall make the eyes of my con-
freres pop with jealousy when i tell
them what i have accomplished this
night sang dui poisson i am one
very clever man monsieur

 tts all a mystery to me de gran-
din i confessed as we drove
home but im hanged if i can un-
derstand how it was that the man
was transformed into a monster al-
most as soon as he wore those flowers

and the woman resisted the influence
of the things for a week or more  
yes he agreed that is strange
myself i think it was because were-
wolfism is an outward and visible
sign of the power of evil and the
man was already steeped in sin while
the woman was pure in heart she
had what we might call a higher im-
munity from the virus of that sinful
blood-flower

  and wasnt there some old legend
to the effect that a werewolf could
only be killed with a silver bullet
ah bah he replied with a laugh
what did those old legend-mongers
know of the power of modem fire-
arms parbleu had the good st
george possessed a military rifle of
today he might have slain the dragon
without approaching nearer than a
mile when i did shoot that wolf-
man my friend i had something
more powerful than superstition in
my hand morbleu but i did shoot a
hole in him large enough for him to
have walked through

  that reminds me i added
how are we going to explain his
body to the police

  explain he echoed with a
chuckle norn dun bouc we shall
not explain i myself did dispose
of him this very afternoon he lies
buried beneath the roots of an ash
tree with a stake of ash through his
heart to hold him to the earth his
sinful body will rise again no more
to plague us i do assure you he
was known to have a habit of disap-
pearing very good this time there
will be no reappearance we are
through finished done with him for
good

  we drove another mile or so in
silence then my companion nudged
me sharply in the ribs this cur-
ing of werewolf ladies my friend
he confided it is dry work are
you sure there is a full bottle of
brandy in the cellar

the city of glass

continued from page 

ing followed by a tremendous crack-
ling

  looking down the avenue i saw a
huge smudge rising between the
houses almost at once there came
an indescribable stench which filled
our little chamber and sent us chok-
ing and gasping to the doors

  we can burn it out said the
professor but this gaseous matter
produced by the burning fungi will
soon smother us if we could create
a draft of some sort or provide a
means for the smudge to escape-ah
i have it well cut a few holes in
the great glass dome which surrounds
atlantis

  i had forgotten for the time being
that atlantis was enclosed in glass
between us and the heavens above
was a thick dome of solid glass barely
visible in the thick steamy atlantean
atmosphere for a moment i won-
dered what new idea he had hit upon
the glass was quite out of reach so
far as we were concerned but his
trained scientific mind had seen the
possibility immediately without
another word he began pulling the
levers anew and i saw the great
lens slowly swing about but the
concentrated beam instead of shoot-
ing upward had turned down then
i noticed for the first time a series of
huge glass prisms which were built
into a steel framework just beneath
the lens these as i was shortly to
see would bend the ray until it could
be played against the skies

 the ray was now turned toward
the heavens for a moment it rested
there and then the professor swung
it around in a great circle presently
there came an ear-splitting crash not
unlike that which comes on the heels
of a bright flash of lightning some-
thing hurtled down out of the air be-
fore us smashing against the roof-
weird

tales



tops with the sound of a thousand
cymbals the ray had cut a circular
piece from the dome above us on
the heels of the crash there came a
light pattering on the pavement out-
side

  why its raining i shouted
running to the door

  dont go out admonished the
professor that isnt rain its molt-
en glass falling from the dome
luckily were protected

  six more disks the professor cut
from the dome before turning the
force of the beam back upon the
spreading fungi by this time the
stuff was gathering like great drifts
of soiled snow in the square below us
we had found our weapon none too
soon the beam from the lens now
turned back into the street leading
to the bridge there came another
hissing and crackling followed by the
same stench this time however the
smudge rolled upward and dispersed
in the heavens

  professor lome held the beam in
the same spot for three hours before
we could see our way clear to the
bridge moving it only occasionally
to burn back the stuff which threat-
ened to creep and engulf us from
below

  i think we had better be starting
now   he announced finally   these
atlanteans were great chemists i
have no doubt there are vast stores
of chemicals situated in different
parts of the city the fungus to the
west is now dried up to the point
where it is slowly burning should
it reach some of these stored chem-
icals we might be all blown into the
heavens and the road to the bridge
is now open

  with that we climbed quickly down
the ladder and made our way through
a veritable canyon of burnt fungi to-
ward the bridge of the city on
either side there was a hissing and
roaring as the dried fungi smoldered
away without the aid of the sun-glass

reach the chemicals we would surely
be destroyed

  and he was right scarcely had
we reached the rim of encircling hills

clearly discernible in the thick

tales



  quickly on the heels of it there
came a terrific explosion which
rocked the earth about us until we
reeled drunkenly against the rocks
then came a blast of livid air that
hurled us over backward on the
sands in the short second between
the shock and the blast i had my last
picture of atlantis-a picture well in
keeping with the horrors of that
thrice-accursed land the monster
pall of smoke had mushroomed out in
the heavens until it took on the form
of a gigantic cobra upraised on its
scaly belly the hood outspread and
menacing the crash came the
hooded head struck at the heavens

  when i arose and looked again
only a thin veil of black vapor on the
horizon marked the spot where once
had flourished this the strangest of
cities and as i gazed even this
faded against the blue and was lost
forever

 might continue my account in a
description of the hardships that
were yet to be our lot before we were
finally picked up almost dead from
thirst by a caravan in the desert
but these events were of so prosaic
and commonplace a nature compared
with what we had just been through
that i have seen fit to end my story
here

  so far as i know no one but us es-
caped from atlantis oddly enough
we could find not a single trace of
the debris when we returned on a
second expedition though in one of
the gullies which must have been un-
der the palace walls we came upon a
skeleton the bones of which were
curiously torn and mangled luck-
ily constance who had now become
mrs garth was not a member of our
party and so professor lorne and i
buried the bones in the gully where
we found them raising a cairn of
stones above the spot on which we
marked the name of colin penfield

then without waiting for any reply
he resumed his walk muttering to
himself all the while we covered
some six blocks more again the doc-
tor stopped he clapped his hands
to his head dislodging his hat but
made no effort to recover it when
i handed it to him he clapped it on
wrong side foremost suddenly he
rushed at me grasped my hands in
his and began working them like a
pump-handle in his excitement i
had never seen him in so exuberant
a mood before

  and the children shall be
wise  he cried  and the wise
men shall be as children how does
the quotation run then linking
his arms through mine he solemnly
turned me round as though upon
parade and we started back again
at a prodigious rate of speed

  -what is it have you-solved the

  the doctor came to a full -once

  to you iftemn to tell me you dont

peals of mighty laughter he hur-
ried me along breathlessly and yet
i knew in my heart that his happi-
ness was not for the solution which
he had found but for the sake of
celaye we reached the apartment
at last and the astonished elevator
boy more sleepy than ever took us
up and deposited us at celayes door
we rang six times before celaye
came out wild-eyed and haggard he
stared at us not in anger but amaze-

explorers into
infinity

by ray cummings

  r i his is without doubt the most
 original interplanetary story
  ever written ray cummings is
 widely known as a writer of start-
 ling pseudo-scientific fiction being
 the n author of   the girl in the
 golden atom and other books
 but he has surpassed himself in
 this new story

  tale of a madcap adventure a
 voyage through space-and
 what a voyage whole starry uni-
 verses flash through this story
 meteors explode against the sides
 of the interstellar craft giants
 dwindle down out of unfathomable
 bigness-beings so vast that a sec-
 ond of their time takes whole years
  of ours the tale gives a sensa-
 j tional glimpse into the scientific
 development of the future an
 t astounding plot but so convincing-
 ly told that the story seems utter-
 ly real this amazing weird-
 scientific tale will beai

and what was it i said to you doc-
tor something unpleasant if so
forgive me

  the doctor flung his arm around
the young mans shoulder and fairly
dragged him into the room the cello
still stood propped against the wall

  you wouldnt let me touch it this
evening cried brodsky snapping
his fingers playfully in the mans
face a fig for your whims play
it yourself play the piece your wife
loved so well-play her transcription
of the heartbeat march from the
seventh symphony he swung ce-
laye round until he faced him play
it he repeated looking into his
eyes

  celayes face grew fixed he could
no longer resist mechanically he
walked across the room took the bow
from the floor where it still lay drew
up a chair and settled himself before
the instrument he drew the bow
across the strings

  and again that rush of thunderous
discords broke from the cello
squeaked and groaned andthe bow
rattled anl scraped and whined ce-
layes eyes opened almost is vide as
mine he dipped thcsbow and sprang
from his chfn as though there were
a nail in it

  well sir said brodsky slowly
though his eyes twinkled ghosts
have been blamed and doctors called
impostors fo better reasons than
that how in thunder do you expect
even the grandest living player to
bring forth music when you forget
to tune your cello and look at that
bow youve left them for months
sir and expect them to prove service-
able get a new bow sir and tune
those strings and dont blame your
own negligence upon those who are
not responsible

chairs of stuyvesant baron will be published in
