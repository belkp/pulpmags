 toinr mnm wild west weekly r nil -- mil iii weekly all stories complete two cow-punch rangers by samuel h nickels i discovered a new hygiene for men past t t had been coming - on for years-this devilish thing called
prostate trouble

 gave it little thought
at first because i figured that all
men experience a certain change
about my time in life that was
my big mistake i thought it was
just the breakdown of oncoming age
and that i would have to put up with
it i did for a while but a year
later my condition went from bad
to worse at an alarming rate

   these common symptoms
my sleep was broken a dozen
times every night in fact one
hours fitful sleep was a luxury
pains had developed in my back and
legs and i was chronically consti-
pated i was run down in body and
almost broken in mind-practically
an invalid at  i talked to scores
of men in fact i talked to prac-
tically every man i met or could get
to listen as i look back now i
think i was practically insane on
the subject

         face surgery
it has been my experience that a
majority of men past -and a sur-
prising number even at -had one
of these distressing symptoms but
few men had it as bad as i did
i had seen my doctor of course
but he could offer me but little re-

lief i spent hundreds of dollars in
an effort to avoid an operation for
i had learned that gland surgery was
usually dangerous this insidious
little gland that robbed me of sleep
and health now threatened my very
life

the turning point

  then i mid one nf your advertise-
ments i admit  mailed the coupon
without the slightest hope there
probably never was u more skeptical
mind than mine but this simple
little act turned out to be the big-
gest thing in mv life

  i can never thank you enough i
am now sixty  can go to bed at
ten oclock and sleep straight through
my doctor has pronounced me in nor-
mal health mv entire body is toned
up and i feel almost like a youngster
i have had no return of the trouble
and now use your pleasant treatment
just fifteen minutes a day over one
or two months just to make sure that
i keep mv perfect health

  millions make this mistake

  when i was at my lowest ebb i en-
countered so many prostate sufferers
that x know there must be millions
of men doctoring for sciatica pains in
the back and legs bladder and kidney
weakness chronic constipation loss of
physical and mental capacity and a
host of supposed old age symptoms
who should probably he trcatitig the
prostate gland in fact i learned not
long agn that eertain medical author-
ities claim that  of men at or past

middle age suffer from disor-
ders of this vital gland

my advice to these men is
not to make the mistake that
i made send the coupon for
that little book the destroyer
of male health find out the facts
about this little gland which the book
contains it explains a prominent scien-
tists discovery of a new home hygiene
--explains how without drugs or sur-
gery without massage diet or exer-
cise this method acts to reduce the
congestion and combat the dangerous
symptoms

scientists book sent free

learn the true meaning of these com-
mon complaints and see why these
ailments in men past  are so often
directly traceable to a swollen pros-

charles slovachek was up
against it hed been out of work so
long he began to believe there werent any-
more jobs to make matters worse he was
in poor health-a handicap that would have
made less ambitious men give up in despair

it was about this time that he ran across an
advertisement in a magazine that offered
honest ambitious men and women a chance
to make big money in a new kind of pleas-
ant short-hour work that could be done in
full time or spare time with the home as
headquarters

the secret of quick money

slovachek was skeptical but since it cost only
a c stamp to get the facts he decided to investi-
gate and that step was a turning point in his
life almost at once his earnings commenced to
climb to undreamed of proportions today all his
money worries are over he drives a ford tudor
sedan given to him free by his employer as an
extra reward for his good work and hes making
more money than thousands of men with ten times
his natural advantages

hundreds doing as well

this story is just one example hundreds of men
and women-young and old-from all parts of the
country-are doing as well or better mrs chris-
tine williams a widow supports two children and
has made as high as  in a single day w a
marek connecticut made  in one day and
has often cleared njore than  a week william
walker  in three days sol korenblit  in
a week mrs mccalmant  in a single day
these exceptional earning records show the re-
markable possibilities

no experience needed

now more men and women are needed to fill simi-
lar positions all you do is follow a few simple
instructions and help the company operate a
route system in your locality with regular
customers and an established route it should be
easy to make up to  or  a day right from the
start

time should be good for  or  a week as

 the brand ot

 the dark garden

 by mary frances doner

getween the two was a barrier
that seemed unsurmountable a bar-
rier of caste and position and yet love
in the long run was able to break it
down

   there was innocent beautiful marjie
 hollins poor with no social standing
 madly in love with dick winthrop who
 in turn was engaged to an aristocratic
 daughter of a proud family

  love had come to them as a summer
 idyl there was little thought of the
 future or the complications that might
 ensue as they pressed close to each other
 under the june stars but they were
 not free agents circumstances hedged
 them about the situation became more
 and more impossible

  the story that mary frances doner
 tells in the dark garden is one that
 grips at the heart of the reader the
 emotional strain is deep and the entire
 novel is packed with adventurous inci-
 dents which make the book live long in
 your memory

ihey laughed
       right out loud

   when i offered to play

-but a moment later a husk
fell over the entire crowd

t bts all give my country cousin
l a great big hand cried
helen dragging me out to the cen-
ter of the room

 everyone at the party started to
clap whats he going to do
someone called out are we go-
ing to be entertained with an ex-
hibition of fancy hog-calling

 no-cousin ned claims that he can
play the piano replied helen but im
sure hes fibbing i happen to know that
there isnt a piano teacher within miles of
his home

  just the same id like to see if you big-
towners can dance as well as you can wise-
crack i retorted not taking any offense

for goodness sakes please
dont play turkey in the
straw    you know this is
no barn dance one of the
boys pleaded

i let them have
their fun

so they thought i was a
hick-that folks from the
country couldnt learn to play
music just as well as people
in the city they thought
too that they were giving
me a great kidding if they
only knew how i had been
toying with them right along

  i started to pull out the
piano bench and someone
started to moo s-h-h-h
-let him have his little
joke said my cousin helen

  but they kept up the razz-
ing hey there-thats a
piano bench not a milk-
stool

 pick your
 instrument

 piano

 ukulele
 cornet

juniors piano course

  no fooling-and this is a piano not ft
writing desk honestly it plays-listen i
and without any preliminaries i broke into
a medley of popular songs there wasnt a
sound in the room i only wish i could
have seen their faces for i knew that i had
given them a surprise

  keep it up-thats great ned shouted
the chap who had been doing most of the
riding

  yes please dont stop begged helen
we want to dance-

  no second invitation was needed i
played every number that they placed before
me suddenly they started to pump me
with questions

  put one over on us didnt you ned
said helen youre certainly the last
person at this party i thought
could play how about let-
ting us in on the secret

no secret

  have you ever heard of the
u s school of music i
asked

  a few of my friends nodded
thats a correspondence
school isnt it they ex-
claimed

  exactly i replied
they have a surprisingly easy
method through which you can
learn to play any instrument
by mail in just a few months
without a teacher

  it doesnt seem possible
someone said

  thats what i thought too
but the free demonstration
lesson which they mailed me
on request so opened my eyes
that i sent for the complete
course

i it was simply wonderful-

  violin
  clarinet
  flute

 saxophone
 harp
 mandolin
 cello

no laborious scales-no heartless exercises
my fear of notes disappeared at the very
beginning as the lessons came they got
easier and easier before i knew it i was
playing all the pieces i liked best

 music was always one of those never-
to-come-true dreams until the u s school
came to my rescue believe me no more
heavy looking-on for me

  

  this is not the story of just one isolated
case over  people have learned to
play by this simple method you can too
even if you dont know one note from an-
other youll grasp it in no time first it
tells you how to do a thing-then it shows
you how in pictures-then you do it yourself
and hear it

  you teach yourself-right at home-with-
out any uninteresting finger exercises tedi-
ous scales or other humdrum methods

free booklet and demonstration lesson

  to prove how practical this course is the
u s school of music has arranged a dem-
onstration lesson and explanatory booklet
which you may have free they show how
anyone can learn to play his favorite instru-
ment by note in less than half the time and
at a fraction of the cost of old slow methods

amazing new automatic finger control

hopelessly in love with the owner of those
eyes and from then on her life became com-
plicated there were those who would bar
the gate to her entrance to that world of
wealth and fashion through which phil near-
ing walked so confidently out of a clear sky
the false accusation of theft was made against
her she felt desolate an outcast and the
cruelty of the world cut deep and then just
as suddenly there came a turn in events that
brought the gold of sunshine into the black-
ness that covered lolitas soul

rangers

chapter i

the wounded rider

the big texas ranger camp
under the rim of the mesa
was seething with excitement
the dingy tents loomed ghostly in
the inky darkness and the hoarse
shouts of armed sentries echoed
weirdly among the thickets of
gnarled mesquites

  halt halt or i fire came the
rapid bark of a watcher followed in-
stantly by the rattle of a breech
ww- d

block as a cartridge was levered into
a rifle barrel

  a thunder of steel-shod hoofs and
a rocketing horse loomed suddenly
out of the blackness its rider sway-
ing weakly in the saddle eyeballs
rolling and body a lather of sweat
the big gelding headed straight for
the cluster of tents

  dont shoot a ranger yelled

  too late the sharp blasting
crack of a big-bore carbine smote the
eardrums and a darting streak of
orange flame winked out luridly


street  smiths wild west weekly

  bang a whizzing bullet split the
air within an inch of the oncoming
riders bobbing head and hummed
spitefully away into the night

  dont shoot no more came a
warning whoop its a wounded
man catch his horse fer im
muffled voices took up the cry as
a score of half-dressed rangers went
running to catch the racing horse
the ring of spur rowels and the
clump of boot heels cut through the
noise of pounding hoofs as shadowy
forms jumped in front of the panting
animal

  i got im fellers keep back
came a low-voiced call ho boy
whoa whoa boy

  the tall ranger got hold of a
trailing bridle rein and spoke sooth-
ingly to the big gelding as it
champed upon the bit and rolled its
eyes toward him he patted its wet
neck and rubbed its nose soothingly

  lift thet wounded hombre out of
the saddle the ranger at the
horses head called sharply help
im down if hes dyin git a state-
ment from im fore he passes out
willing hands reached for the
wounded stranger who was already
trying to dismount he slid heavily
to the ground and stood swaying
dazedly his knees buckled beneath
him and he would have fallen but
two rangers threw their arms about
him and held him up

  who shot yuh hombre a ser-
geant barked what happened to
yuh tell us quick

  for a moment the fellow choked
and tried to speak he rolled his
bloodshot eyes up at the circle of
faces a crimson froth dyed his
bearded lips and he clutched weakly
at his chest where a heavy bullet had
gone clear through him

  ghost riders of the rio he

gasped jerkily they-

  this was as far as the fellow got

he slumped forward in tlie arms of
the two rangers who held him a
shudder of his gaunt frame and he
lost consciousness

 slam saddles on yer horses
men captain robert barked
well hit this hombres trail
maybe we can nab them murderous
skunks fore they git across the rio
grande

  hold on thar cap came a sharp
call and a lanky loose-jointed cow-
boy came slouching lazily through
the crowd if yuh go bustin back
after them jaspers with a whole
company theyll hyar yuh cornin
long fore yuh git in shootin dis-
tance me an little rusty handle
this alone

  yuh bet yuh a short sawed-off
waddy barked and little rusty
shoved forward and finished buck-
ling on his gun belts if me an
hungry here cant nab them hom-
bres the rest of yuh neednt try it
git out of my way

  the grizzled old ranger captain
whirled and stared sharply at the
two new recruits he had lived too
long in the wild borderland to disre-
gard their suggestion

  more than this startling tales of
the shooting and fighting ability of
hungry hawkins and rusty boli-
var had been told throughout the
length and breadth of the frontier
captain roberts looked keenly at
both men

  they were young fellows in their
early twenties but entirely different
in their appearance and dispositions
they had just joined the rangers
that afternoon either of them
would fight his weight in wild cats-
and give the cat the first scratch

  rusty was a tiny wiry-built hom-
bre quick-tempered fiery and a
dead shot with either hand it was
little rusty who started more than
nine tenths of their fights
two cow-punch rangers



  hungry was a long lanky dole-
ful-looking fellow who seldom talked
much when he did it was in a
soft apologetic voice with his
shambling loose-jointed figure his
dangling bony arms shoveliike
hands and his habit of rolling his
eyes mournfully upward when
spoken to hungry looked to be al-
most anything but the fighter he
was

  but range men who knew or had
heard of hungry hawkins were not
deceived by his meek appearance
in spite of his peaceful almost bash-
ful disposition hungry was by far
the more deadly of the two partners
when trouble started very often it
was he who finished what little
rusty began they were partners
and inseparable

  so you two hombres want to go
after the ghost riders of the rio
grande do yuh captain roberts
barked want to tackle the job
alone huh

  thets what we jest done said
rusty snapped if yuh cant trust
us to do the job well resign from
yer danged ranger company right
now do we go or dont we

  the captain studied their faces
thoughtfully he knew men-men
in the rough-and he knew just
about what such frontier gun
fighters as these two wild cowboy
recruits would do or try to do if
they hit the trail of that notorious
band of outlaws

  if yuh aint back by the time i
think yuh should be company b
will come to help yuh start ridin
he ordered

  rusty was already running to get
their horses in a moment he was
back and he and hungry swung into
their saddles

  you better take some grub with
yuh the captain called

  yeah maybe wed better take a

chuck wagon an a cook too
rusty snarled sarcastically git
out o the way

  respect for a superior officer was
certainly one thing that did not
oother rusty and neither he nor
hungry acknowledged any superior
when it came to handling outlaws
and bad men both punchers
usually handled them roughly and
they did it with smoking guns

  come on pard hungry called
stop talkin an lets ride

 the two cowboy rangers
slammed home the spurs and shot
away through the mesquites in a
moment both were swallowed by
the darkness as they sped swiftly
down the narrow trail into the night

chapter ii

the burned cabin

qoin to be a heck of a job fol-
lerin thet wounded hombres
back tracks rusty snapped to
hungry as they sped along

  no use to foller em hungry
drawled hes bound to have come
up this draw well not bother with
tracks until we git close to the main
trail moonll be up higher then
an we can see to foller em spur
up

  without a pause except to make
sure they did not miss-the trail to
the canyon the fighting partners
sped swiftly along in and out
among the shadowy mesquites
through clumps of grease wood and
around spiny beds of prickly pear
over ledges of crumbly rock and
across dry arroyos they guided their
plunging mounts

  once a horse stumbled and went
to its knees a shower of gravel
hurtled from the trail as it lunged
snorting to its feet reared and
bounded on a snarl from its rider
it was rustys mount that had al-


street  smiths wild west weekly

most gone over the canyon rim the
lanky sad-eyed hungry would never
have said a word

  suddenly a bank of fleecy clouds
rolled away and the moon could be
seen rising slowly from behind the
neighboring hills higher and higher
it mounted until the wild forbid-
ding landscape was flooded by its
ghostly radiance

  the flying forms of the two
rangers loomed weirdly as they
swept through the shadovvs cast by
the gnarled mesquites the light
gleamed dully on the conchas of
their batwing chaps on buckles
cartridge belts and low-swung gun
butts

  better slow down an begin
watchin out fer tracks hungry
grunted were gittin close to the
main trail

  rusty pulled his horse down to a
slow trot and bent low to peer at the
rocky shelf over which they were
passing hungry was already cut-
ting back and forth in an effort to
pick up the wounded hombres
tracks

  i got it hungry announced
quietly he passed this way
drop in beside me an keep yer eyes
peeled from hyar on

  yuh think i aint got sense
enough to do thet without yuh
tellin me rusty snarled impa-
tieritly lead on yuh danged shin-
nery squirrel

  with hands dropped conveniently
close to their holstered guns and
wary glances flitting to every boul-
der bush or ledge of rock capable
of hiding an ambushed marksman
hungry and rusty rode swiftly on
they knew they were coming close
to where the wounded rider had been
shot a man could not have ridden
far with a bullet clear through him

  and the two ranger recruits knew
just what type of outlaws they were

hunting the ghost riders of
the rio grande were the worst col-
lection of thieves and killers that
had ever infested the rim of the
wasteland 

  there were about twenty of the
slit-eyed desperadoes and they
seemed to have their hiding place
somewhere in a low range of rocky
hills a few miles south of the rio
grande they would cross the river
under cover of night rob and kill
then be miles away before the texas
rangers could make a move to head
them off

  somehow these ruffians managed
to keep posted as to the movements
of the officers they knew at all
times just where and when to look
for them this made it easy for the
outlaws to dodge them and commit
their crimes almost in safety

  too they seemed to know exactly
when a ranchman made a sale of
cattle and when he received his
money they were informed far in
advance when mine pay rolls were
sent in or gold shipments were to be
made

  some person or persons were evi-
dently acting as spies for the ghost
riders just who they were the
rangers had not been able to learn
but several saloon keepers along the
little river towns had been suspected
from time to time

  i dont see much sense in trackin
thet hombre back to where he was
shot rusty complained impa-
tiently i bet them ghost riders
has done vamosed across the river
into old mexico

  i just figger to make shore it was
ghost riders hungry explained
patiently

  a few moments after they struck
the main canyon they caught the
pungent scent of wood smoke and
saw a faint glow against the night
sky a few miles to the west of them
two cow-punch rangers



rusty straightened in his saddle
with a jerk and he shot hungry a
searching glance

  cabin burnt hungry remarked
quietly thets about where the
shootin took place we dont need
these tracks any more lets ride

  they lifted their horses into a
dead run at the first rake of their
heavy spurs limbs of the thorny
mesquite slashed and tore at their
old chaps ripped the sleeves of their
shirts and stung their faces as they
pulled their sombreros tight upon
their heads and went racing toward
the scene of the crime

  but they were too well acquainted
wit-h the deadly nature and treach-
ery of the border desperadoes to ride
blindly into danger enemies in the
open where they could blast them
out of their saddles with smoking
guns were one thing but killers who
waited in the dark with rifles
ready were something else

  in a dense thicket of stunted ce-
dars about two hundred yards from
the glowing ruins of the cabin hun-
gry and rusty slid their horses to a
halt and leaped from their saddles
both jerked the short carbines from
their scabbards and levered car-
tridges into the stubby barrels

  yuh take the left an ill take
the right hungry grunted softly
if theres anybody still thar well
git em between us

  a nod from little rusty and they
went slipping away through the
gloom in such  way as to reach the
burned cabin from opposite sides
they left their mounts among the
cedars

  within a short distance of the
burned house hungry crouched
down and stared searchingly in
every direction seeing nothing he
twisted his head and looked toward
the opposite fringe of brush for
some sign of rusty

  just then an owl hooted loudly
hungry jerked his carbine to his
shoulder and waited

  again the owl hooted this time
hungry lowered his gun he pulled
off his sombrero and holding it
loosely over his face he hooted
three times these were old signals
that he and rusty often used at
night

  given quickly those seemingly
harmless hoots meant that danger
threatened given slowly with
plenty of pause in between them
meant that nothing was to be seen

  hungry stood up and dropped his
rifle across his arm just then
rusty came walking out of the
brush toward him

  i reckon them jaspers has pulled
out rusty remarked disgustedly

  i figgered theyd be gone hun-
gry said

  without another word both be-
gan searching about the place for
tracks the roof of the old adobe
house had fallen in and burned
down to a bed of coals these
glowed red through the smoke-
blackened windows as the two rang-
ers looked carefully about the lit-
tered yard and toward the picket
corrals

  suddenly hungry came to a halt
beneath a heat-blistered cotton-
wood at his grunt rusty lifted his
rifle and jumped toward him

chapter iii

the cantina by the rio

pind somethin rusty barked

 without answering hungry
pointed to a small sheet-iron box
that had been broken open with an
ax he nodded and stooped to ex-
amine it more closely

  the lock had been beaten off and
the lid pried-up there upon the
ground where they had been care-


street  smiths wild west weekly

lessly tossed aside the rangers
found some papers presently
rusty picked up a twenty-dollar
gold piece that lay half buried in the
dust

  robbery hungry said nodding
i reckon the thieves lost thet withr
out missin it reckon they mustve
made a pretty good haul to lose a
coin the size o thet un without no-
ticin it

  them ghost riders i reckon
rusty snapped

 hungry nodded yeah been
about twenty men hyar theyll be
the right number fer them treach-
erous varmints bound to ve been
them

  hungry put the papers back into
the box and shoved the lid down as
best he could then he put it up in a
fork of the tree this done they
hurried back to their horses and
swung into their saddles

  well rusty inquired wasp-
ishly as he picked up his bridle
reins we know where theyve
gone do yuh figure theres any use
trackin em

  none whatsomever hungry re-
plied reaching lazily for his chew-
ing tobacco them jaspers has lit
a shuck fer the healthy side of the
rio grande hours ago wed just
be wastin time

  hungry mouthed his quid of to-
bacco into his gaunt cheek and
glanced mournfully across at rusty
he chewed thoughtfully for a mo-
ment then turned and stared down
at his horses ears as if he expected
to find the answer to their problem
there

  well yuh goin to set hyar all
night rusty demanded impa-
tiently we was sent to catch them
thieves an killers if yuhve done
forgot what we come after

  a pained look saddened hun-
grys mournful face he spat wea-

rily into the brush then turned re-
proachfully to rusty

 cant yuh stop botherin me
when im busy thinkin he com-
plained patiently id purty nigh
figgered out what i was goin to do
when yuh butted in now hush a
minute i got to begin all over
again

  rusty let out a strangled snort of
rage he glared disgustedly at his
lanky partner who was again study-
ing his horses ears

  i got it hungry at last an-
nounced

  better hog tie it so it wont git
away on yuh rusty snarled sar-
castically tell it quick maybe i
can help yuh remember it

  hungry winced at this thrust he
looked across at little rustys wasp-
ish face and sighed heavily

  well he said finally hyars
what i figger i best to do some-
bodys keepin them ghost riders
posted on whats goin on through
this section im goin to make use
of one of them hombres whoever he
is an well let them thievin cut-
throats come after us instead of us
goin after them come on an foller
me

  hungry quit the main trail and
headed his big cow horse straight
across the low hills toward a sleepy
little mexican village that sprawled
a straggling cluster of mud-roofed
adobe shacks beside the sluggish
rio grande the filthy saloon and
gambling hole there had long been
suspected as the place where the
outlaws had been getting the infor-
mation which guided them in their
murderous raids along the border

  the first gray streaks of dawn
were just beginning to tint the east-
ern horizon when hungry and
rusty reached the rim of a low
mesa that overhung the canyon of
the rio grande there beneath
two cow-punch rangers



them the sluggish yellow stream
wound lazily between low bars of
treacherous quicksands to cross
there was extremely dangerous and
it could be done only at certain
places

  well hyars the rio rusty
grunted what next

  hungry acted as if he did not
hear he was thoughtfully study-
ing the little village that nestled
there along the dusty road which
wound crazily between the clumps
of mesquite near the river bank

  i reckon wed better hide our
ranger badges fore we ride down
there he suggested with a sleepy
yawn well pin em inside the
waistband of our pants without
them badges nobodyll think were
anything but a couple o stray cow-
hands

  they hurriedly unpinned the sil-
ver badges of the texas rangers
from the front of their flannel shirts
and fastened them where they could
not be seen just inside the top of
their trousers this done they went
riding leisurely down the steep mesa
trail into town

  a few minutes later they came
trotting carelessly up the littered
road that served as a street black-
shawled women eyed them wonder-
ingly as they passed brown men
shot them sly searching glances and
more than one hand stole caress-
ingly to knife hilt or six-gun butt as
the partners rode along

  i dont figger thet texas cow-
hands is very popular around this
particular neighborhood rusty ob-
served i done spotted me several
hombres i aint meanin to turn my
back on

yup hungry grunted down
hyar a fellers health depends a lot
on how far he can see behind im
an how quick his gun hand works
near the end of the street hun-

gry turned aside and dismounted in
front of an old cantina this ram-
bling adobe combination of saloon
gambling den restaurant and dance
hall bore the toughest name of any
along a thousand miles of mexican
border it was the proprietor of this
dive who had long been suspected of
being in league with the ghost
riders and who supplied them with
information

  i reckon we can git us a cup of
coffee an a bowl of chili here hun-
gry remarked with a meaning look
at rusty let me have thet thar
twenty-dollar gold piece yuh found
at the burned ranch house i got a
particular use fer it

  as rusty slipped him the coin
hungry hid it in his big hand then
he whispered a few hurried words of
instruction as he dropped it into his
chaps pocket by a barely seen
lowering of his left eyelid rusty in-
dicated that he understood

  knowledge of just what hungry
was up to brought a dare-devil twin-
kle to rustys dancing gray eyes
the little ranger felt to make sure
that his twin guns were loose in their
tied-down holsters then he bow-
legged it behind his lanky pard to-
ward the door

chapter iv

kidding a bartender

 coffee-colored bartender

    was busy swabbing off the rough
bar with a damp and none-too-clean
rag as they stepped into the long
low-ceilinged saloon except for
him the evil-smelling place was en-
tirely deserted

  this hombre dropped his rag as
they entered and he shot the cow-
boy rangers a venomous look from
beneath his hooded lids he brushed
a tin cup from the edge of the bar
with his elbow and it clattered nois-


street  smiths wild west weekly

ily to the floor it was so clumsily
done that the partners knew in-
stantly that it was a signal to some
one in a back room

  rusty sneered and hooked both
thumbs in his gun belts

  why didnt yuh just holler hom-
bre he snapped sarcastically
yuh neednt have dropped the tin-
ware

  the fellows swarthy pock-
marked face twisted in a wicked
snarl the long knife scar that
reached from the edge of his un-
kempt hair in front of his ear to the
point of his chin gleamed a dirty
white as he glared sullenly

  whatll eet be gents he de-
manded it was both a question and
a challenge and his hand went
stealthily beneath the bar as he
spoke

  keep thet hand up in sight
hungry ordered softly put it up
where i can see it hombre

  the bartender darted the lanky
ranger a sharp look hungrys
doleful face looked even more
mournful and solemn than ever but
his low voice held a note of deadly
warning and a greenish light was
smoldering dangerously from under
his lowered lids none but a close
observer could have noticed it

  the fellow brought his hand up
slowly and laid it on the bar in
front of him there was a look al-
most of fear on his repulsive face as
he did so

  thets better hombre rusty
snapped keep yer little hand
where we can see it the first gun
thet starts a tune around hyar find
ours chimin in on the chorum an
therell be chili con carne scattered
from hyar to mexico city savvy

  speakin o chili hungry said
mildly yuh can git us a bowl
apiece an a couple o cups o cof-
fee hurry feller were a little

anxious to git away from hyar an
into the hills

  as hungry said this the fellows
features underwent a change to be
in a hurry to get away and into the
hills could mean but one thing down
here it meant that the partners
were on the dodge-that they were
wanted men and seeking to escape
from the officers for some crime

  he was almost civil as he mo-
tioned them toward a greasy table
then hurried out into a back room
as he vanished through the door
hungry winked heavily and leaned
closer to rusty

  were bank robbers he whis-
pered softly dodgin rangers an
makin our git-away with a big haul
of gold got the money hid out in
the hills let im think it without
tellin im

  rustys unconcerned sniff told
that he understood perfectly the
little ranger began whistling tune-
lessly between his prominent teeth
and glancing about the filthy bar-
room at the gambling devices the
battered pool tables and at the
cheap pictures on the dingy bullet-
scarred walls

  hungry slouched lazily in his
chair one long chap-clad leg thrown
carelessly across the other his head
was tilted back and he appeared to
be dumbly watching a huge spider
that was crawling across the ceiling
apparently he was interested in
nothing else but in reality he was
alertly watching the door through
which the bartender had gone after
the chili and coffee

  suddenly the door was pulled
slightly open and from the corner
of his eye hungry saw a man watch-
ing him closely without turning
his head hungry dropped his right
hand lazily into his lap and hooked
his thumb in his gun belt just above
one of his black-butted s from
two cow-punch rangers	

that position he could draw and
shoot with the speed of a darting
rattlesnake-and what hungry shot
at he usually hit

  the door closed softly then it
opened with a noisy squeak as the
bartender came hurrying in with the
steaming bowls of chili and two tin
cups of hot coffee hungry care-
lessly tossed the twenty-dollar gold
piece upon the table but he keenly
watched the fellow from the corner
of his eye as he did so

  hey yuhll git us in bad yit
droppin them twenties around fer
people to see rusty snarled hotly
dont let hombres see thet gold
yuh fool

  hungry gulped and pretended to
be greatly disturbed he grabbed
up the gold piece and tossed some
silver in its place then with a wor-
ried look at rusty he crammed the
twenty back out of sight

  the bartender unbent noticeably
at this he almost smiled later
he did smile when rusty made a
guarded inquiry as to whether rang-
ers ever came into the saloon or
frequented that part of the river

  you safe een thees place senor
he grinned meaningly rangers
he no lak come here eet ees no safe
for thems you savvy

  dont tell im nothin pard
rusty snarled hes just tellin us
thet but hed turn us in fer the re-
ward if he got half a chance

  there you go hungry com-
plained bitterly howd this hom-
bre a knowed there was a reward
fer us if yuh hadnt made thet
break shet up an eat yore chili
then lets git away from hyar
there was now an understanding
grin on the bartenders oily face
he went out to the other room
again but was back in a moment

  senores he said with a sly
wink maybe you lak to eat een an-

other place where no one can see
you you come weeth me an i
show you

 hungry and rusty both rose
quickly they grabbed up cups and
bowls and followed the mexican out
into a tiny room at the end of the
saloon here the bartender left
them and closed the door behind
him

  when the fellow had gone hun-
gry nodded at rusty and glanced
meaningly toward the door rusty
winked and leaned closer

  theyve put us in hyar on pur-
pose he whispered softly they
figgered wed talk to each other i
bet theres moren one jasper lis-
tenin out thar near a keyhole fer all
hes worth

 uh-huh i know it hungry
said softly go ahead an give em
an earful yuh know what to say
rusty did and he said it be-
tween mouthfuls of the hot chili he
proceeded to hand hungry a pre-
tended calling-down for coming so
near to giving them away once he
heard a slight noise at the door
some one was there and was getting
every word he uttered-and imagin-
ing more

  when rusty had finished he left
his listeners firmly convinced that he
and hungry were the two worst
bank robbers and killers who had
ever hit the border to have heard
little rusty one would have be-
lieved that he and hungry were
even now escaping from the scene of
their latest crime and that they had
thousands of dollars in gold hidden
out at some secret place in the hills

  well wed better be gittin on
back rusty said finally come
on well beat it fore some of them
rangers comes bustin in on us

  as they shoved back their chairs
and stood up they distinctly heard
sounds of running feet near the door


street  smiths wild west weekly

the listeners were getting away
rustys wizened face twisted in a
knowing grin

  the bartender was more than
friendly when they went back into
the saloon rusty scowled at him
and hungry walked to the door for
a supposedly wary glance up and
down the street

  you boys stay here an res up
to-day the bartender invited
you een no danger weeth us

  is zat so rusty gritted dart-
ing him a savage look listen
hombre were beatin it away from
here an if yuh put anybody on our
trail-well itll just be too bad fer
yuh thets all

  we aint wanted men nohow
hungry called yuhve made a
mistake on us them texas rang-
ers is plumb friends of ours

  the bartender grinned he was
now firmly convinced that both men
were desperadoes of the very worst
type the thought of hungry
claiming to be friendly with the
rangers was what caused him to
grin so knowingly

  both cowboys were killers and all-
around bad hombres and no one
could have made him believe other-
wise too he knew they must have
a lot of stolen money hidden out in
the hills

chapter v

old dynamite

j-jungry and rusty swung into
their saddles and went galloping
back along the foot of the mesa
hungry was busily studying every
canyon they passed and he was
studying them with an eye to busi-
ness-ranger business

  hey hungry we got thet bar-
keep hombre loaded fer bear rusty
chuckled happily whatll he be
doin with what he thinks he knows
do yuh reckon

  look behind yuh an see hun-
gry suggested with a trace of a
placid smile on his homely face
take a good squint an yuh might
see if anybodys crossin the river
while yore at it

  rusty shot hungry a keen look
then he whirled in his saddle and
stared behind them he pulled his
hat brim lower to shade his eyes
from the glare of the sun as he bent
a searching glance toward the
gleaming waters of the rio grande

  suddenly rusty gave a startled
grunt he raised himself upon his
toes in the stirrups and leaned his
weight against the saddle horn as
he watched a man who was picking
his way swiftly among the sand
bars the hombre was riding hur-
riedly toward the mexican shore

 look yonder hungry rusty
barked there goes some mex
across the river he knows where
hes goin too

  messenger to the ghost riders
hungry remarked without turning
his head i figgered i had thet
bartender sized up right take an-
other look an yuhll find some other
jasper trailin us one of them hair-
pins has been sent to keep us lo-
cated an to see where weve camped
the other is to bring them ghost
riders of the rio grande to rob us
of our supposed gold

  i dont see nobody on our trail
rusty complained

  well yuh neednt wtorry some-
bodys follerin us hungry said
carelessly come on

  rusty let out a shrill cackle of
laughter but there was no mirth in
the sound the peppery little ban-
tams keen blue eyes were dancing
with an unholy light and he was
hungrily fingering his gun butts

  this looks as if it might be a
likely spot hungry remarked criti-
cally glancing up a narrow canyon
two cow-punch rangers



well ride in hyar an just take a
peep

  they swung their mounts aside
and rode quietly up a faint trail
about fifty yards inside the canyon
narrowed until there was scarcely
room for their horses to pass be-
tween the high walls of yellow clay
and gravel hungry nodded and
grunted to himself at sight of this

  whatre yuh figgerin on now
rusty snapped

  dont bother me when im busy
thinkin hungry replied patiently
i dang nigh had an idea then but
yuh interrupted me

 aw rusty snorted huh
maybe id better fan yuh an hold
yer head while yuh think feller if
yuh was to ever git two ideas at
once wed need a doctor

  with this rusty lapsed into
scornful silence and they rode on
presently the canyon widened out
into a little grassy flat and they
saw a small cabin just ahead of
them

  a wary glance and they saw that
the cabin was old and had long been
deserted it was built of mud and
flat stones and the sagging roof was
of pinon poles covered with dirt
the door sagged upon rusty hinges
and the single tiny window was
without sash or covering

  some old goat-herders shack or
a miners cabin hungry an-
nounced well look inside
samples of ore on the window
ledge and on the ground beneath it
told the cowboy rangers that it was
the latter in the gloomy interior
they found a rickety pole bunk and
a rusted sheet-iron stove amid a
litter of rubbish of every kind

well make camp hyar hungry
announced well take a peep
around the canyon first then well
come back an clean out the shack
rusty let out an angry yell at the

suggestion of cleaning up the shack
he glared hotly at hungry and his
waspish face twisted in a snarl of
disgust

  me help clean up this mess he
gritted like heck i will yuh can
clean it yerself what do yuh think
i am-a prairie dog or a gopher
hungry sighed despondently and
walked outside a careful look
around and he found that they
were in a tiny box canyon the
walls of weather-worn clay which
surrounded the place on all sides
were high and absolutely unclimb-
able there was no way out except
through the narrow opening where
they had ridden in -

 hungry smiled serenely and
reached for his much-gnawed plug
of chewing tobacco

  couldnt have beat this place if
wed had it built to order he mut-
tered i reckon thisll be our hang-
out

  rusty swore he wouldnt lift a
hand to help clean out the cabin
but he did still complaining and
swearing bitterly that he would get
even at some early date he grudg-
ingly picked up a piece of plank and
began shoveling out the rubbish

  they were both hard at work
amid a boiling cloud of dust when
little rusty located a battered box
underneath the bunk he paused
for a moment to mop his sweated
face with his bandanna then with
a muttered grunt he stooped and
hauled the box out where he could
examine it

  whatve yuh found hungry in-
quired let me see

  look out rusty gave a startled
yell its old dynamite git away
from hyar while were still whole
rusty dived through the door
and flattened himself against the
ground outside hungry glanced
patiently after him then he walked


street  smiths wild west weekly

over and began examining the dusty
dynamite sticks

  feller yuhd better be cornin
out o thar fore yut git blowed out
rusty shouted thet powder is so
old its liable to be spotted spotted
dynamitell let go at the slightest
jar i know somethin about thet
stuff yuh dont even need a cap
to let off spotted dynamite im

a-tellin yuh-

  hey i can use this stuff to help
nab them ghost riders hungry in-
terrupted happily why theres
even caps an fuse hyar look at
what im goin to do

  hungry picked up the box and
came lugging it out into the yard
at sight of him rusty let out a
startled yell and went running away
across the shallow arroyo he
stopped at a safe distance and shook
his fist at his lanky partner

  dont yuh come no closer to me
with thet danged stuff he yelled
warningly if yuh aint got no
sense durn yuh i have thet old
stuffs liable to let go any second
well stand over thar an watch
me then hungry called

chapter vi

the ghost riders

j-jungry sat down and began to
arrange the sticks beside him
presently he took up the coil of fuse
and cut off fully a dozen short
lengths which he fitted with caps

  this done to his satisfaction he
fixed each stick of dynamite with a
capped fuse and tied it with a string
so that it would hold together

  when hungry had finished with
this he dusted off his hands and
picked up the remainder of the
deadly dynamite which he cradled
in his arms he rose to his feet and
started with it down tjie canyon
come on rusty he called over

his shoulder come on an watch
what i do with this

  ill come an watch but ill be
a safe distance away when yuh git
blowed up rusty replied testily
there wont be nothin left o yuh
but a grease spot on these canyon
walls drectly

  hungry sighed patiently and
went stalking unhurriedly down the
canyon at the narrow place he
hunted until he located a spot where
he could climb out on top by means
of jutting rock and bushes

  feller rusty remarked criti-
cally when hungry was about half-
way up if yore foot was to slip
while yore packin thet dynamite up
thar yuhd be about the scrambled-
uppest corpse that the angels ever
harvested on this range

  at the top hungry got a stout
limb of mesquite and dug a deep
hole into this he deposited the re-
mainder of his dynamite-about
thirty sticks he fixed this with
caps and a short fuse then he
tamped the dirt back solidly on top
of it all when he had finished he
called rusty

  well maybe since yuh got it
buried itll be safe to come look
rusty remarked grumpily

  the little ranger scrambled up
to where hungry sat waiting rusty
eyed the place where his lanky part-
ner had planted the deadly explo-
sive then he reached disgustedly for
tobacco and papers

  hungry was just starting to ex-
plain his plans when rusty bounded
back to the edge of the high bank
and flashed a gun from his holster
the peppery little redhead thumbed
back the hammer and peered at a
spot a couple of hundred yards
down the short canyon

  i reckon thetll about be the spy
our bartender amigo sent to keep
tab on us hungry remarked
two cow-punch rangers



dont shoot im i figgered hed be
showin up soon

  why shouldnt i shoot im
rusty demanded in great disgust
hyar i got me an easy shot at a
feller thets trailin us an yuh dont
want me to kill im of all the fool
notions i ever heard tell of yuh
seem to git the foolishest

  let im snoop around till he gits
im an eyeful hungry replied care-
lessly set down hyar an ill tell
yuh what were going to do

  rusty glared reluctantly toward
the spot where the mexican spy lay
hidden the little ranger grunted
angrily and slammed his gun back
into his holster with a rebellious
glare in his snapping blue eyes he
plumped himself disgustedly down
upon a boulder to listen

  rapidly but in as few words as
possible hungry outlined what he
had in mind as he talked rustys
face gradually took on an expression
of admiration and glee at the fin-
ish he slammed his brown fist upon
his knee and cackled outright

  for sheer boldness and cold nerve
hungrys scheme aroused rustys
undisguised admiration the little
ex-cowpoke had a decided respect
for old dynamite which might ex-
plode too soon but when it came
to gun fighting with outlaws rusty
was ready to declare himself in on
that to the finish

  if a chance bullet dont wipe us
out well land the whole gang
rusty grinned lets git back so
we can kid thet spy along

  hungry knocked over a rabbit
with his six-gun and they broiled it
for dinner several times that
afternoon they noticed their horses
snorting and glaring at something
which was hidden in the fringe of
brush that lined the tiny arroyo

  the two rangers exchanged
knowing glances hungry smiled at

the look of unholy glee on rustys
wizened face they knew it was
the spy who was watching them

  late in the afternoon as the sun
began to sink like a flaming red ball
toward the western horizon the
horses quieted down by this the
partners knew that the spy had gone
away to report

  they ate an early supper of rock-
squirrel meat then they carefully
cleaned and loaded their guns they
built a good fire in the cabin stove
and heaped plenty of half-green
wood into it so that they would
cause an abundance of smoke
hungry wanted any watcher to feel
certain this was a permanent camp

  when night settled down still and
black the cowboy rangers resad-
dled their horses and led them up
close behind the cabin where they
left them standing with bridle reins
dropped this done hungry began
leisurely filling his pockets with the
dynamite sticks to which he had at-
tached the extremely short fuses

  when little rusty noticed what
his lanky partner was doing he
scrambled hurriedly to his feet and
went scuttling around the corner of
the cabin at a safe distance he
glanced warily back and let out a
snort of disapproval

  feller if yuh insist on messin
with thet stuff keep away from me
he snapped angrily i dont mind
dyin but ill be etarnally danged if
i want to do it in pieces i want to
git me a whack at them ghost
riders fore i pass out anyhow

  yuhll git a whack at em hun-
gry said quietly

  will i rusty grunted sarcas-
tically i might if they happened
to be in the way when i git blowed
out of the canyon im warnin
yuh to keep away from me with thet
stuff i aint cravin to be spattered
all over them outlaws


street  smiths wild west weekly

  the lanky lantern-jawed hungry
sighed dolefully and reached a freck-
led hand for his chewing tobacco
he eyed little rustys fighting face
reproachfully for a moment then he
gnawed off a chew and lazily re-
turned the plug to his hip pocket

  he had just leaned back against a
convenient boulder and settled his
gaunt frame comfortably when
without warning one of the horses
snorted sharply and both of them
threw up their heads hungry
bounded to his feet as rusty shot
past him and leaped into the saddle

  htfld on thar hungry called
softly dont yuh use the horse
theyll hyar yuh better circle em
on foot run an git yer matches
ready

 yuh reckon its them ghost
riders rusty whispered

 bound to be no one or two
mend come to tackle us hungry
said weve made thet bartender
think we was too tough i bet yuh
the whole ghost rider band is hyar
after us in full force

  rustys wizened face twisted in a
grimace of extreme pleasure he
nodded and jumped lightly to the
ground in another instant he was
scuttling away in the darkness to-
ward where hungry had planted the
huge charge of dynamite

  hungry led both horses back into
the brush then he lay down behind
the cabin suddenly he caught the
faint click of hoofs flattening him-
self still lower so as to bring every
object between himself and the
starry sky he waited

chapter vii

only one gang

por a little while everything was
quiet but that very stillness
shrieked a warning presently there
came a slight scraping sound as of a

thorn rasping across leather a
shadowy form emerged silently
stealthily from the fringe of bushes
near the arroyo

 hungry smiled mournfully and
watched close on the heels of the
first ghost rider he saw the rest of
the murderous band come creeping
out of the shadows they had left
their horses farther down the canyon
and were trying to steal upon the
cabin afoot

 the cowboy ranger had seen
enough the ghost riders had
come to rob and murder them for
the gold they were supposed to have
everything was going just as he had
planned

 hungry wasted not a second
now to work the scheme he had in
mind he bounded to his feet and
darted into the cabin he grabbed
up a stick he had purposely thrust
into the front of the little stove
the end of this mesquite stick
glowed in the light of the dark room

  hungry blew his breath upon the
stick to keep it glowing then he held
it in front of him as he ducked
through the door and around the
corner

  closer and closer came the creep-
ing outlaws the starlight gleamed
dully on drawn six-guns on belt
buckles conchas and brass car-
tridges in the crisscrossed belts
every outlaw wore a black mask
tied across his face and hat brims
were pulled down to hide their eyes
hungry was sure he saw the bar-
tenders thick figure in the band

  at that instant from down the
canyon an owl hooted dismally a
second later it hooted again
sharply

 hungry smiled that supposed
owl was little rusty

  rustys got to his place an is
standing ready hungry muttered
softly hyar goes
two cow-punch rangers



  he jerked one of the sticks of dy-
namite from his pocket holding it
carefully in his left hand he softly
blew upon his stick which he held in
his right suddenly he stiffened

  halt thar hombres he barked
loudly hands up an make it
pronto

  a chorus of startled yells greeted
this and a crashing volley from
their ready guns hurled dust and
bits of rock from the corner of the
cabin where hungrys head had
been a hoarse shout from their
leader and the ghost riders lunged
forward

  i offered em a chance hungry
grunted as he jammed his glowing
stick against the end of the fuse
then hurled the sputtering dynamite
at the charging outlaws i reckon
thet give em somethin to study
about

  wha-a-m the ground shook as
an earth-jarring blast for a second
lighted the scene of conflict

  blistering oaths yells and screams
of pain burst from the astounded
ruffians the survivors scattered
and ripped a hail of bullets at the
fighting ranger

  hot lead from fanned colts show-
ered leaves from the bushes zipped
through the tall grass flattened or
glanced from the cabin wall and
whined spitefully off into the dark-
ness but hungry had already
darted aside and was even now hold-
ing his glowing coal to a second
stick of dynamite

  b-o-o-m before hungrys fuse
ignited there was a roar from down
the canyon the mesa rim was illu-
minated as if by lightning

  in the blinding glare a wall of
earth seemed to leap into the air as
from a volcano dust gravel dirt
and debris for an instant blotted out
the starlight as the brown mass
seemed to hover in the heavens

   suddenly with the jarring thun-
der of a roaring waterfall it came
down the wall at the narrow pass
toppled for a moment then settled
like an avalanche on top of it and
a choking haze billowed above the
 spot

  a satisfied smile wreathed hun-
grys homely face rusty had let
off the dynamite at the narrow point
of the trail where hungry had
buried it now the trail was effec-
tually blocked and not an outlaw
could escape except by climbing
over the wall of dirt- in the face of
little rustys belching guns

   but as yet the murderous ruffians
 had no thought of escape they far
 outnumbered their intended victims
 and they meant to gun them both
 without mercy

   like darting fireflies their flam-
 ing colts winked luridly in the dark-
 ness bullets hummed and whined
 about hungrys crouching form
 flattened against rocks and boulders
 stinging him with cutting slivers of
 hot lead

  again hungry held his glowing
coal to a stick of dynamite as it
caught with a hiss he hurled it to-
ward the thickest of his foes

   ban-n-g brush stones and dirt
burst into the air and howls echoed
from the ghost riders

  a bullet jerked hungrys som-
brero around on his head another
grazed his ear and a crimson stream
dripped upon his shoulder he
shook his head and reached for his
holstered colts

  the ghost riders were now
spread out before him like a fan
and his dynamite could not down
more than one of them at a time
he could do that well with his six-
guns

   slowly shooting with both hands
at every flash of an enemys colt
hungry retreated stubbornly to the


street  smiths wild west weekly

barricade of dirt where rusty impa-
tiently awaited him darting
tongues of orange-red flame lanced
toward him from hot gun muzzles
as he ducked from rock to rock
pausing at each spot to rip an an-
swering shot at the nearest of the
ghost riders

  lead them jaspers over hyar
where i can git me a whack at em
too rusty screeched do yuh
want to be a plumb hog an enjoy all
the fun toll em over this way

  a hasty glance over his shoulder
as he crouched behind a boulder to
reload his empty guns and hungry
saw rustys head outlined between
him and the starry sky rusty was
peering down in the darkness clutch-
ing a big colt in each hand

  hungry snapped the loading gates
shut on his hot s and fired at the
nearest flash of an enemys gun
the lanky ranger was now sinking
at every backward step in the soft
dirt that blockaded the canyon
mouth he had lost his mesquite
stick with which he had been light-
ing the dynamite fuses

  hey thar yuh two hombres
came a hoarse bellow from a ghost
rider surrender peaceable an
well let yuh live

  yuhll do what rusty yelped
from his perch above them feller
yuhve got a lot o gall fer a jasper
thets got one foot in boot hill
cemetery an the other on a bacon
rind surrender yerself an well let
yuh live long enough to hang

  a chorus of hoarse oaths from the
ghost riders followed this guarded
calls came from different points
then their spokesman gelled sav-
agely at rusty

  what do yuh mean by offerin to
let us live long enough to hang he
bellowed who aire yuh talk up
fore we gun yuh an leave yuh fer
the buzzards

  texas rangers hombre texas
rangers thats all rusty cackled
happily

  startled gasps greeted this state-
ment a snarled cry came from
back in the brush and the rangers
recognized the bartenders voice

  waal there aint but two of
yuh the spokesman of the ghost
riders whooped

  thets a plenty rusty shot
back yuh aint but one gang

chapter viii

by the dynamite trail

jnstantly a hurricane of bul-
lets showered among the rocks be-
side him lying flat on his stomach
guns thrust between two boulders
rusty fired at the flashes of the
ghost riders weapons

  charge em men came a roar
from the leader of the outlaws we
got to down em to reach our
horses

  a clump of boot heels a ring and
clink of spur rowels then with wild
yells and guns flaming the ruffians
burst from their cover hungry
jammed a match to a fuse and
hurled another stick of dynamite
at its earth-jarring roar he tore into
the outlaws with crashing colts
while rustys weapons roared de-
fiance from above him

  with startled oaths the outlaws
retreated and threw themselves
down in the brush from there
they poured a galling fire at the two
lone star rangers who opposed
them

  for hours the battle raged then
it slowed to a sniping contest time
after time the ghost riders charged
and tried to get past the barricade
but on each occasion hurtling dyna-
mite and fanned colts drove them
back to shelter

one side of little rustys shirt was

ww- d
two cow-punch rangers

a crimson smear where a creasing
bullet had torn through the flesh
beneath an armpit and grazed a rib
hungry was hit in seven places but
he was still fanning his guns at
every movement ofthe enemy

  as the first faint streaks of dawn
began to tint the eastern horizon he
and rusty saw the few remaining
ghost riders retreat toward the
cabin

  the outlaws barricaded them-
selves inside and kept up a hot fire
through the cracks of the door and
through the open window

  hungry climbed painfully up be-
side rusty and the two pards crept
around the canyon rim to where
they could look down upon the
cabin hungrys eyes were red-
rimmed from loss of sleep and his
face was caked with sweat and dirt
his left ear was badly swollen where
a bullet had torn through it and he
had a crude bandage about his right
arm above the elbow

  rusty walked too near the edge
of the canyon wall and a volley of
bullets fanned the air on all sides of
him he ducked back and threw
himself flat upon the rim rock he
was just lifting his colts for a x-e-
turn shot when hungry croaked
hoarsely

  roll back out of the way little
pard ive got two sticks of dyna-
mite left an im figgerin to use
em

  rusty glanced wearily over his
shoulder as hungry pulled the yel-
lowed sticks from his pocket fear
of the old stuff was gone now he
knew that if they were going to ex-
plode too soon they would already
have done so hugging the ground
and peering between two rocks he
watched hungry touch a match to a
short fuse

  as the powder caught with a
snakelike hiss hungry bounded for-
ww-d

ward and hurled the deadly missile
down toward the house it struck
fairly upon the roof and rolled a few
feet as if it meant to drop to the
ground suddenly pieces of the roof
seemed to leap into the air

  a shattering roar and the walls
buckled outward the door flew
several feet into the yard for a
few moments they could see nothing
for the huge cloud of dust that bil-
lowed above the spot

 hungry and rusty jumped to
their feet and looked down warily
hungry was just reaching for his
tobacco when two men reeled
drunkenly out of the wall of flying
dust

  it looked as if these two survivors
of the outlaw gang were about to
fall they staggered and one of
them glanced up toward the two
rangers

  suddenly they whipped up their
guns and fired hungry and rusty
slapped guns from their holsters and
dropped the hard-bitten hombres be-
fore they could fire a second shot

  well i reckon thet jobs done
with rusty said wearily

  yeah but we got another un
thets dang nigh as bad hungry
replied mournfully we got to fig-
ger out some way o gittin our
horses over thet load o dirt we
blowed down in the canyon

  they were just starting to go
around where they could climb
down when they caught the thud
of steel-shod hoofs rusty shot
hungry a questioning glance and
srjapped his smoke-blackened guns
from their holsters

  there was a puzzled look on hun-
grys doleful face he shook his
head and with a deep sigh dropped
his hands warily to his gun butts
and waited

  yuh reckon its more ghost
riders come to jump us rusty

snapped over his shoulder as he
dropped into a fighting crouch and
peered down the canyon

ing his guns and cocking them de-
terminedly i think we done ac-
counted fer them jaspers i figger
this is some other gang-an i aint
got but one stick o dynamite left
to salute em with

  at that instant a big crowd of
speeding riders came rocketing
around the bend of the canyon
they were spurring their sweating
horses like mad and every man held
a blue-barreled six-gun poised in his
right hand for instant shooting

  ill take thet fat hombre on the
right rusty barked lifting his

the whistlin kids
injun brand

by emery jackson

author of the whistlin

riding a dim trail which
wound through the stunted
chaparral the whistlin kid
approached a gray-walled rambling
adobe casa

  while still a hundred yards dis-
tant he rained his big speedy-look-
ing buckskin gelding to a halt

  low notes of the mournful cow-
boys lament came from his puck-
ered lips as he slowly surveyed the
casa its outbuildings and corral

  it was a wild section of the border
country and this isolated casa bore
a bad name and reputation it was
la posada de los fugitivos-the inn
of fugitives-or in plain range lan-
guage it meant a roadhouse where

kids outlaw trail etc

hombres on the dodge stopped for
food and rest or a change of horses
while making their get-away across
the mexican border

  the kid was not deceived as to
the character of the place it was
in the line-of his work as a range de-
tective for the cattlemens associa-
tion to secure information regarding
such places to catch range
crooks you got to know their hang-
outs was a saying of the c a serv-
ice

  the keen dark eyes of the kid
missed nothing of what was in sight
around him least of all did he
overlook that other rider who was
coming across the sage flat


street  smiths wild west weekly

 that hombre has sure been
pounding the trail to-day mut-
tered the kid to himself noting with
expert eyes the tired gait of the on-
coming bay broncho

  with a light pressure of the knees
the kid sent his buckskin fox-trot-
ting toward the casa

  since dawn the kid had been rid-
ing at an easy gait from the west-
ward and now the sun was setting
in golden splendor behind a far-dis-
tant range of sawtooth mountains

  it was a call for help received
by the c a from a big eastern cat-
tle company owning the rocking r
ranch which had brought the whis-
tlin kid to this lonely desolate sec-
tion of southern new mexico the
kid had been a cow-puncher before
becoming a range dick he had
helped trail a herd of mexican long-
horns through here a few years pre-
vious and the lay of the land was
still clear in his mind

 to the northward beyond the
wide-stretching sage flat was mal-
pais-rugged bad lands which the
kid knew was the haunt of outlaws
that knowledge was sufficient to
arouse his interest in the hombre
who came riding down toward la
posada de los fugitivos

  the kid reined up his buckskin in
front of the posada evidently he
had struck the place at a time when
business was slack there were no
horses at the hitch rail swinging
down out of the saddle the kid left
his own mount standing with
dropped reins while he strode
through the open door of the can-
tina

  as he had expected the low-ceil-
inged barroom was empty of cus-
tomers a mexican mozo was lazily
rolling a keg of aguardiente from a
rear room behind the bar which
filled one side of the gloomy room
the fat pock-marked mexican pro-

prietor juan quintero sat on a high
stool apparently quintero had
been dozing away the time in a
siesta for he only half opened a pair
of little rat eyes as the kid entered

  yet the young range dick could
have sworn that he had glimpsed a
dark pitted face peering at him
through the shutters of a casement
window as he rode up to the posada

  you aint foolin me none hom-
bre the alert kid told himself as
he moved toward the bar you got
a plenty tough joint here but i dont
aim to let you put nothin over on
me v

  the fat keeper of the posada slid
off his stool and grinned evilly at his
youthful customer here was a
gringo to be fleeced of his belongings
but it would have to be done care-
fully quintero shrewdly decided as
he sized up the kid

  the latters deeply tanned hawk-
ish face with its high cheek bones
bold outspringing beak of a nose
and rugged fighting jaw gave warn-
ing that he was not one to submit
tamely to rough treatment

  give me a bottle of ginger ale
and a glass of water for a chaser
was the kids surprising order

  quintero was plainly disturbed by
his customers failure to order high
liquor not knowing that it wras
something the kid never touched
he rattled off a string of spanish
words shrugging his thick shoulders
to emphasize his meaning

  whats all the gabble erbout
asked the kid pretending not to un-
derstand spanish if you want to
argy with me talk american

  there ees no geenger ale said
the posadero-innkeeper-who had
counted on a few drinks of potent
tequila to make the kid helpless

  waal then ill take jest plain
water persisted the kid and you
can give me a sack of makins
the whistlin kids injun brand



  quinteros fat face wore a sneer
as lie set out a glass of none-too-clear
water and then tossed a sack of to-

                     r

bacco and cigarette papers on the
bar

  laying down a coin the kid lei-
surely proceeded to roll and light a
quirly

  he was still smoking when the
rider from the north arrived a few
minutes later

  without seeming to take any in-
terest in the new arrival the kid sat
down at a table in a dim corner of
the barroom from that position
he could not only watch what went
on inside the cantina but through a
casement window at his elbow he
could see the hitch rail in front

  it was characteristic of the kid
that his gaze went first to the brand
on the strangers tired bay horse
watching brands was an important
part of his job many a clew to rus-
tling operations had been picked up
in that way

  thets a rockin r iron mark on
thet broncs shoulder the kid mut-
tered to himself as he made out the
brand faintly through its coating of
dried sweat and alkali dust

  it was a horse belonging to the big
outfit which had appealed to the
c a for the services of a range
detective could that tough-look-
ing hombre who swung stiffly down
from the saddle be one of their rid-
ers more likely he had stolen that
horse thought the kid as he
watched the hombre stalk into the
cantina with clanking spurs

  nor had the kid failed to note
the swift expert glance which the
newcomer bestowed on speed the
big biickskin as he passed it

  tilting his chair back against the
adobe wall the kid pretended to
doze but all the while he was siz-
ing up the stranger through slitted
eyelids

  the two six-guns with notched
butts that hung low on the hom-
bres thighs marked him as a killer
big and powerful black-browed
with fancy silver trimmings on chaps
and sombrero he was a half-breed
the kid decided

  quintero the innkeeper addressed
the hombre familiarly by the nick
name of panchito as he served him
a brimming glass of raw tequila
evidently these two knew each other
well

  a rapid exchange of rough border
spanish followed between the two
men on opposite sides of the bar
this was not lost on the kid who
spoke the language of mexico flu-
ently although he had allowed the
fat posadero to think that he did
not understand it both hombres
glanced at the kid as they talked

  it was apparent from their re-
marks that they considered the
young gringo of no importance be-
sides being asleep he was unable to
savvy their lingo so over several
drinks of strong tequila they grew
confidential

  then the listening kid learned
that the two hombres were brothers-
in-law he heard them laugh as
panchito told how he had stolen the
money which the gang of rustlers to
which he belonged had cached in
their hideout in the malpais and
how he had taken the fastest horse
from their stolen herd and made a
safe get-away he would be in
mexico in a few hours with enough
money to last him for months of
riotous living

  the kid pretended to rouse him-
self from his siesta in the corner of
the cantina he had heard all that
he needed to know a course of ac-
tion had swiftly shaped itself in his
mind

  whistling a few doleful notes of
the cowboys lament he went to


street  smiths wild west weekly

the bar and asked the posadero re-
garding feed for his buckskin and a
meal and lodgings for himself

  quintero seemed slyly pleased
over the idea of having the kid for
an overnight guest he smirked his
satisfaction ordering a lazy mozo to
take the horse around to a corral
in the rear of the posada

  but the kid never allowed any
one other than himself to care for
the faithful buckskin between the
young range dick and speed there
was a deep bond of affection ce-
mented by the many dangers which
they had shared together going
out to the hitch rack the kid led his
horse to the corral where he fed
watered and rubbed down the cay-
use

  upon his returning to the cantina
the kid was directed to a rear room
adjoining the kitchen where a slat-
ternly mexican woman served him a
meal consisting of chile con carne
and tortillas made of ground corn
and water here he was quickly
joined by panchito the half-breed
rustler and quintero

  darkness had fallen by the time
the kid had finished eating he
went back to the cantina leaving
panchito and the posadero still wolf-
ing down great quantities of the
heavy food

  after whiling away an hour play-
ing solitaire and smoking brown-pa-
per quirlies the kid rose to his feet
yawned and requested quintero to
show him a place to sleep

  without seeming to notice any-
thing that went on around him the
kids alert eyes caught the quick
glances of satisfaction that passed
between the fugitive outlaw and the
fat posadero the latter hastened
to show his guest to a small bedroom
located on the far side of the ram-
bling adobe casa

  instead of turning in to sleep on

the rough rawhide-covered bed the
kid barred the door as soon as his
host had departed then blew out the
coal-oil lamp and turned to the one
small window which opened into a
large patio or courtyard

  it was pitch dark outside which
was all the better for the kids pur-
pose he felt sure that the evil-
eyed innkeeper and his cutthroat
brother-in-law had devised some
wicked scheme with himself as the
victim so it was up to the kid to
be on guard

  and not only did the kid intend
to forestall any offensive move on
the part of his enemies but he had
a scheme of his own to carry out of
which the capture of the burly pan-
chito was an important part

ii

  the kid had no difficulty getting
out of the window and once out-
side the casa he was able to make
his way across the patio without
delay or discovery thanks to obser-
vations taken earlier in the evening

  loosening his colt  in its hol-
ster on his thigh the kid went
straight to the adobe corral at the
rear of the casa he had a strong
hunch that panchito had designs on
speed the buckskin the animal
was valuable and undoubtedly the
fugitive rustl had expertly sized it
up as possessing unusual speed and
stamina

  nor had the kid long to wait for
proof of the correctness of his hunch
hardly had he got settled to watch
from behind a heavy two-wheeled
carreta near the corral gate when
he saw the bulky figure of panchito
outlined for a moment in the light
from an open door in the rear of
the casa

  then the clank of spurs and the
muffled tramp of footsteps on the
the whistlin kids injun brand



sandy ground told of the approach
of the rustler the darkness was
intense only because the hombre
was erect and moving could the kid
barely make out his blurred form as
he drew close

  within ten feet of the watching
young range dick panchito stopped
and then the kid saw that the half-
breed carried a reata was building a -
loop

  the buckskin was standing quietly
at the corral gate having sensed
that its master was near the big
geldings uplifted head was dimly
skylighted against the horizon

  panchitos hand suddenly jerked
up and forward in the motion of an
overhand throw of the reata the
loop hissed as it shot straight at
speeds head then it settled and
was jerked taut

  hawss thief huh the whis-
tlin kids voice cut sharp and cold
through the still dark night

  quien es who are you came
back in startled spanish

  im the owner of that caballo
youre tryin to steal snapped the
kid speaking also in spanish

  the half-breed must have sensed
his danger on the instant for he
dropped the reata and dived head-
long into the black shadow of the
corral wall

  the kid was likewise perfectly
concealed for a moment neither
man moved

  then panchito began to crawl
noiselessly changing his position for
added safety and at the same time
getting closer to his intended prey
he figured that he knew about
where the kid was that he must be
between the old wooden-wheeled
carreta and the corral wall he
aimed to empty his six-gun into the
troublesome young ranny as soon as
he was sure of his exact location

  moving like a cat through the

darkness panchito drew nearer to
the kid he almost stopped breath-
ing so intent was he in stalking his
enemy

  then suddenly he ran into a dog
that had been sleeping on a pile of
empty grain sacks beside the corral
wall the frightened animal gave 
yelp as it fled from the spot

  if the half-breed had called out
he could not have revealed his posi-
tion more surely than the dog had
done desperate he jerked up his
gun and began blazing away at the
narrow space between the carreta
and the wall with a little luck he
might score the first hit

  but the answering roar of gunfire
came from the other side of the car-
reta the kid also had shifted his
position

  panchito tried to suppress a cry of
pain and only partly succeeded he
had been hit hard he attempted to
swing his heavy gun around to line
it on the spot where the lurid flashes
of orange flame betrayed the fight-
ing kids location

  but two more slugs of hot lead
thudded into his burly body he
groaned hoarsely tried to rise to his
feet and fell forward on his face

  during the moment of silence that
followed an alarmed voice called
from the rear door of the posada

  oye panchita what has hap-
pened it was quintero the posa-
dero calling

  the kid remained silent he
wasnt taking chances on the half-
breed rustlers being alive and able
to pull trigger there was no way
of telling in the darkness whether he
had scored a fatal hit or not

  quintero stepped back in the casa
returning in a moment with a lighted
lantern he came waddling straight
for the corral his fat body looming
in the flickering rays of the lantern

  suddenly the posadero halted


street  smiths wild west weekly

lifted his lantern and peered at a
huddled form on the ground

 caramba muerto-dead as
he exclaimed quintero glanced fear-
fully around him

  the watching kid stepped quickly
forward into the circle of yellow lan-
tern light

  this here brother-in-law of yours
was an hombre malo a reglar bad
man said the young range dick
using the border spanish which was
quinteros native tongue he tried
to steal my hawss and figgered to
kill me fer interferin only i beat
him to it

 you-you- quinteros ugly

bloated face twisted in an evil snarl
as he stuttered his rage and hatred
of the hawk-featured young gringo
who had so effectually upset the
scheme which he and his cut throat
relative had expected to put over

  dont speak out o your turn
hombre warned the kid coldly
hold thet lantern sos i kin see
what this thief has got in his pock-
ets

  fearful of what his own fate might
be quintero held the light above
the remains of the half-breed

  working swiftly the kid took
three big rolls of currency and a
small bag of gold coins from the dead
outlaws pockets

  he was sure makin a rich haul
said the kid estimating that there
must be several thousand dollars of
the loot but seein as he wont
have no more need of this dinero ill
take charge of it fer a while

  you gringo diablo sputtered
quintero unable to contain his rage
at sight of all that money going into
the possession of a hated americano

  go easy on thet line of talk i
aint tellin you agin now call
your mozo and have him saddle up
the rustled caballo this hombre
rode

  wondering at the strange order
the fat posadero called loudly to his
mexican servant

  the kid saddled his own buck-
skin while he kept a watchful eye
on quintero and the working mozo
when both horses were ready the
kid compelled the innkeeper and his
helper to tie panchito on the saddle
of the stolen bay broncho the
money he put in the saddle pockets
of his own rig

  so long hombres me and pan-
chito are takin a lile pasear up-
country announced the kid as he
swung into the saddle and took the
lead rope of the dead rustlers
mount

  leaving quintero and the mozo
standing in open-mouthed wonder
at the strange proceeding the young
range dick rode away into the night
only the low whistled tune of the
doleful cowboys lament-a dirge
well suited to the occasion-floated
back to the cowardly mexicans

iii

  day was breaking over the mal-
pais when the tired kid neck-reined
his tough buckskin into the mouth
of a gloomy canyon

 all during the night he had
plodded steadily across the sage
flats with the stark form of the dead
outlaw swaying in the saddle of the
bay broncho behind him

 onward through the shadowed
depths of the canyon the kid rode
although he well knew that he was
entering the guarded haunt of a des-
perate band of rustlers the kid
made no attempt at concealment or
even quietness he whistled the
lament as he rode its melancholy
air mingling with the clop-clop of
speeds shod hoofs

  its best to let em know im corn-
in reflected the kid no tellin
the whistlin kids injun brand



how many gun slingers is watchin
the trail to them skunks hideout
it was a bold scheme that the
daring young cow dick was about to
try out one slip would cost him
his life once he was in the midst of
the notorious gang which the kid
had heard was led by a desperado
known as bad-luck barton

  and it seemed that he was due to
be with the outlaws in a very short
time for as he was about to enter
a section of the canyon so narrow
that there was only room for one
horse in the trail he was hailed by
a gruff voice directly above him

  reining his horse to a quick stop
the kid glanced upward at first
he could see nothing but a ledge of
rock covered with stunted brush
which had its roots in little pockets
of earth held in the cracks

  then the voice came again and
this time its owner showed his whis-
kered face and the muzzle of a car-
bine through the chaparral

  where the heck yuh think yore
goin fella demanded the guard

  the kid stopped whistling and
answered with apparent unconcern
i was sort of aimin to run acrost
bad-luck barton happen hes still
hangin out in these here parts
huh yuh mightnt be so danged
anxious tuh meet him ifn yuh knew
what he does tuh snoopers growled
the black-bearded hombre

  he kept his gun trained on the
kid as he spoke the light was
none too good in the depths of the
canyon as yet evidently he wasnt
taking any chances on the new ar-
rivals getting away from him

  whos thet layin acrost the back
of thet other bronc suddenly went
on the guard he had just made
out the dim form of the dead out-
law and became suspicious

  thets a pal of yours name of
panchito coolly remarked the kid

  huh whats thet panchito
almost shouted the guard in amaze-
ment what happened whar did
yuh find him an who are yuh

  if them questions of yours was
bullets id be plumb riddled
chuckled the kid i reckon the
best thing ter do is fer us both to
ramble erlong till we find bad-luck
and then i kin spill the yarn all ter
onct

  a grumbling his impatience to learn
what astonishing news the kid had
to tell the hombre on the ledge
came scrambling down to the floor
of the canyon

  all right come erlong then
growled the guard but im warn-
in yuh thet yuhll never see the out-
side of this malpais agin ifn theres
anythin phony about yore yarn

  after passing through the wind-
ing narrow cleft for a distance of
about a hundred yards the kid
found that it widened slightly here
a dun broncho saddled and bridled
was tied to a juniper tree

  the bearded guard lost no time in
mounting the dun and spurring it
alongside the kids buckskin

  the kid had been quick to note
the possibilities for defense of this
entrance to the rustlers hideout
one well-armed guard could easily
have held off a posse at the narrow
passageway it was easy to under-
stand why the cowmen had never
got inside the malpais to search for
stolen stock

  the kid and his surly guide cov-
ered upward of a mile at the best
pace their horses could make on that
rough trail then the observant
kid saw that they were entering a
good-sized open park it was well
watered as he could tell by several
clumps of willows that suggested
flowing springs the grass was good
also

  it was an ideal spot for an outlaw


street  smiths wild west weekly

hideout difficult to locate and prac-
tically safe from assault by an ordi-
nary posse

  a roomy cabin stood near a small
grove of jack pines back of it was
a pole corral in which a bunch of at
least a dozen saddle horses was
penned

  the kids quick glance took in
the whole layout lingering for a mo-
ment on a goodly herd of fat steers
grazing over the park the kid was
an expert on everything pertaining
to brands his duties as range detec-
tive for the c a made it necessary
that he should be able to read any
iron mark he ran across the brand
on these steers was the same a
rocking r the kid quickly saw

  so fur im gettin a break mut-
tered the kid to himself with quiet
satisfaction hq was inside the rus-
tler hideout and had the proof of
their thieving operations before his
eyes

  but to take advantage of his good
fortune was going to be a mighty
dangerous undertaking as the kid
well knew in fact he was going
to be put to an ordeal during the
next few minutes that was highly
charged with peril

  bad-luclc an the rest of the boys
is at grub pile right now explained
the guard gruffly as he motioned for
the kid to head for the cabin

  you been doin guard duty down
in the canyon all night queried the
kid

  uh-huh im sposed to be re-
lieved soons the gang gits done with
breakfast bad-luck will send an
hombre high-tailin it down there
pronto when he sees me he dont
take no chances of havin a passell
of cowmen run in on him

  right smart chief you got the
kid nodded

  he was wondering just how clever
an hombre this bad-luck was prob-

ably that queer nickname had come
to him because of the trouble he
caused others not on account of any
misfortunes of his own

  waal i got to meet mr bad-
luck barton and pass his tests the
bold young range dick told himself
and likewise should any one of
thet gang happen to a seen me
somewheres and know who i am itll
sure cook my goose

  the kid felt his veins tingle as he
rode up to the cabin door already
there were streaks of ruddy light in
the east that foretold an early rising
sun

  as the kid swung down from his
saddle the cabin door opened and a
half dozen of the toughest-looking
hombres the kid had ever laid eyes
on came rushing out evidently one
of the gang must have glanced out
of the one dirty window and noted
the strange procession approaching
the cabin

  rough voices rose as oaths and
questions were hurled at the kid
sight of the body of their former
comrade in crime brought exclama-
tions of wonder and curiosity to the
lips of the rustlers

  in the midst of the tumult an un-
dersized man came shoving his way
to the foreground as this hombre
stopped and gazed at him the kid
felt a cold chill run down his spine

  the fellow was as wicked and
murderous looking as a weasel his
little rat eyes seemed to look clear
through the young cow dick de-
spite his small stature it was easy
to see that he ruled the gang with
an iron hand they slunk back
from him as they might have done
from a rattler

  this heres bad-luck hisself and
hes plumb pizen the kid told him-
self without having to hear the evil
name mentioned

  i brung this here young walloper
the whistlin kids injun brand



up tuh camp count of him packin
panchito along with him chief ex-
plained the burly bearded guard

  it was plain that the big hombre
stood in awe of the little rustler
leader he seemed to sense that he
was in for trouble because of having
deserted his post in the canyon nar-
rows

  yuh did huh snarled bad-luck
barton turning his angry gaze on
the guard ruther than wait a few
minutes till the day guard came tuh
relieve yuh yuh left the hull works
wide open fer a bunch of john laws
tuh jump us

  before the watching kid-or any
of the outlaws for that matter-
could realize what was happening
the rustler chief jerked a heavy colt
from its tied-down holster and fired
point-blank at the shrinking night
guard

  a look of bewilderment spread
over the stricken outlaws bearded
face his knees buckled and he
crumpled down in a heap on the
hard ground

  for a moment there was not a
word spoken the kid was too
amazed for speech never had he
witnessed such stark ferocity as badr
luck barton had just displayed the
man was a demon when crossed

  good riddance snapped the
rustler chief glaring around at the
other members of his gang him
an panchito both big joe was a
fool an the breed was yaller clean
through the gang wasnt safe as
long as either one of them coyotes
was alive

  turning to one of the awe-stricken
hombres barton ordered him to
mount the dead guards horse and
hasten down to the narrows

  then suddenly switching his gaze
back to the kid the little outlaw
looked for a long moment into the
latters youthful hawkish face

  the kid coolly returned the look
he was whistling a few low notes of
the cowboys lament and wait-
ing to see what the murderous bad-
lucks reaction was going to be to
his presence there in the hideout

  apparently the rustler chief was
making a mighty effort to identify
the new arrival yet bartons hard
face still wore a puzzled expression
as he gave up the mental struggle
and began to question the kid
whar did yuh pick up this
double-crossin skunk yuh dont
size up tuh be experienced nough
tuh be able tuh stop him in a gun
fight panchito was a fast gun
slinger

the kid

  yeah how come

acrost the border

  howd yuh know whar he was
from an whyd yuh pack him back

ciously

gered mebbe youd like to see with
your own eyes what happened to
him	x

  yore right about thet snapped
bad-luck sourly aint but one
thing id ruther see than panchitos
carcass full of lead

  mebbe youll see thet one thing
if you was to look in my saddle
pockets the kid replied with a
quick guess as to what the rustler
chief was referring to

  if yore foolin with me tharll
be buzzard meat aplenty hombre
said bad-luck with deadly threat in
his rasping voice

  whirling in his tracks the little
rustler reached for the buckled strap


street  smiths wild west weekly

on the nearest pocket of the kids
big stock saddle tense with in-
terest the other outlaws craned
their necks to see what the result of
the search would be

 their amazement increased as
barton pulled sheaf after sheaf of
greenbacks from the saddle pocket
then he stepped quickly around
speed the buckskin and reached
into the other pocket there he
found the bag of gold

  fella i reckon we owe yuh an
apology an a vote of thanks all at
the same time said barton above
the clamor of the half-unbelieving
rustlers who seemed unable to grasp
the idea of having a man return
money that he had once got his
hands on

  fair nough said the kid coolly
all im askin is a chanct to ride
with you hombres

  well do bettern thet declared
barton for the time being in high
good humor over the fate that had
overtaken the tricky half-breed and
the recovery of the stolen loot
yuhll take panchitos place have
his share of the money an his
hosses

  thanks a heap said the kid
elated over the outcome of his dar-
ing venture and now if you dont
mind me and my hawss will eat a
bite

iv

 it was midday when the kid
rolled out of a bunk in the cabin
he had slept several hours and felt
fit to cope with any situation that
might arise but just how he sin-
gle-handed was going to capture
half a dozen hard-bitten desperate
rustlers was yet to be determined

 the kid was going over this
knotty problem in his mind while
he whistled the mournful cowboys
lament and took long drags on a

brown-paper quirly when bad-luck
barton entered the cabin

  heard yuh whistlin thet grave-
yard tune of yores an thought id
come in an have a talk with yuh
said the rustler chief

  the mans little beady eyes never
left the kids face for an instant
while he spoke it gave the young
range dick a very uncomfortable
feeling he sensed that barton was
trying to place him was groping in
his mind for the recognition which
had so far eluded him

  fire away responded the kid
calmly whats on your mind

  a herd of steers mostly bad-
luck answered wtith an evil grin
got a bunch of rockin r critters
out here eatin up all our grass an
caint figger out how tuh git rid of
em

  how come aint yuh been haz-
in wet cows acrost the border afore
this asked the kid with far
greater interest than he dared to
show

  shore we have but thets jest
it the cowmen has got onto our
racket an theyre guardin every
crossin of the rio grande day and
night

  you can blot the brands cant
you

 yeah we done thet too
growled barton but we aint in
the cattle business reglar dont own
no registered brand so them cow-
men is suspicious of any stock we
try tuh dispose of want tuh hold
the critters while the brand is in-
vestigated

  i reckon thet would worry you
plenty agreed the kid but
theres a way to beat thet game

  the quick-witted young cow dick
had seen the possibility of turning
the rustlers plight to his own ad-
vantage more than ever now that
he was again face to face with the
the whistlin kids injun brand



hard-bitten barton did he realize
the necessity of quick action in
whatever he hoped to do at any
moment some recollection of past
events might give the desperado the
clew he evidently sought as to the
kids identity

  the latter had been in many fights
with rustlers in various sections of
the southwest range country had
landed a lot of them in jail from
time to time it was likely that
barton had encountered the kid at
sometime during his career of out-
lawry

  but so far the rustler had asked
no personal questions it was con-
trary to the custom of the range
country

  meanin which asked bad-luck
barton with quick interest yuh
got any scheme in yore head

  for answer the kid took a stub
of lead pencil from his pocket leaned
over a scrap of wrapping paper on
the rough board table and began
to draw

  with curiosity brightening his lit-
tle rat eyes bad-luck barton looked
over the kids broad shoulder and
watched the moving fingers

  fer heck sake what do yuh call
thet the rustler finally asked

  didnt you ever see an injun
brand asked the kid straighten-
ing from his task

  caint say thet i did but since
yuh mention it i recollect havin
heard a mex apache breed tell about
em onct barton nodded

  waal this heres one said the
kid with a runnin iron you kin
disfigger any brand thet was ever in-
vented jest make some crazy
marks over it thet dont mean noth-
in to nobody but the hombre thets
doin the rustlin it keeps the
rightful owner of the cow critter
from identifyin his own brand and
at the same time he cant prove

nothin on the rustler cause thet
smart hombre kin claim a mistake in
readin the brand as an alibi

  a right slick trick exclaimed
barton with open admiration for
this clever new member of his gang

  then lets git to workin it
pronto suggested the kid im
rarin to git busy

  me an yuh both feller agreed
barton come on well git the
boys an start brandin

  after roping their mounts out of
the corral the rustler crew rode
across the grassy park to bunch the
cattle for brand-blotting

  all the outlaws were in high spirits
after the scheme for outsmarting the
owners of the stolen cattle had been
explained to them by their leader
it seemed to be a guarantee of
safety to all hands there was a
chance for them to haze the herd
across the border without being
caught but if they were stopped by
watchful cowmen nothing could be
done to them

  the rustlers reasoned that their
claim to the queerly branded cattle
would be as good as any ones no
cowman could rightly say what the
injun brand really was for the sim-
ple reason that it would mean
exactly nothing mistakes in read-
ing it would be certain it was no
wonder that they fell for the idea

  the kid rode his buckskin beside
bad-luck barton who was mounted
on a rangy roan gelding the mo-
ment for which he had waited and
schemed was at hand

  for the object back of the in j un-
brand idea which the kid had sug-
gested to the rustlers was simply to
put them to work at branding to
scatter them so that he could take


street  smiths wild west weekly

them one or two at a time instead
of having to fight the whole gang at
the same moment

  the rustlers quickly proved them-
selves to be expert cowhands under
bartons direction they soon had
the steers bunched the kid joined
in the work he had been a cow-
puncher before becoming a range de-
tective his buckskin speed was
a thoroughly trained cutting horse

  dripping wet with sweat and
half smothered in the cloud of dust
that hung over them like a great
gray blanket the rustlers worked at
putting the crazy figures shown
them by the kid on the rocking r
steers

  the young range dick was on the
alert every moment for a chance to
catch the rustlers in such positions
that he could hope to overcome
them but so well trained were they
that the operation of brand-blotting
went on like clockwork

  there was no scattering of the
workers two hombres held the ex-
cited cattle from breaking away two
cut out the steers and roped and
threw them close to the branding
fire one man used the running iron
while a companion helped hold
down the struggling cow critter al-
ways two men were standing by
resting and awaiting their turn to
relieve a couple of the workers

  that pair of unoccupied rustlers
was the stumblingblock to the kids
success they had nothing to do
but watch what was going on around
them

  the kid was beginning to despair
of getting a break when suddenly a
shift of the layout brought him his
chance it was the turn of bad-luck
barton and a scar-faced hombre to
rest instead of remaining near the
scene of work smoking and squat-
ting on their heels in the shade of a
jack pine both men rode away

barton went back to the cabin to re-
plenish his supply of tobacco while
his companion rode over to a spring
at some distance from the herd for
a drink

  the kid was handling the running
iron at the moment one quick
glance around told him that now
was his time if ever the two men
holding the herd were on the far
side completely hidden by the dust
cloud the ropers were busy in the
herd that left only the one hom-
bre who helped the kid with the
branding

  smack the long barrel of the
kids  thudded alongside the rus-
tlers head just above the left ear

  he went down without a sound
out for many minutes to come
hastily the kid dragged his victim
into the cover of some jack pines

  speed the buckskin was standing
close by the kid leaped into the
saddle fast action was demanded
now

  hardly had the daring young cow
dick spurred back to the brand fire
when both ropers came charging up
with a bawling steer as their horses
came to a plunging halt the kid
wheeled his buckskin beside them
he had them covered before either
one realized what was happening

  climb offn them broncs keeping
your hands as far from your gun
butts as you kin get em sternly
ordered the kid

  amazed at the startling turn of
events the two rustlers slid out of
their saddles under the kids
watching eyes they led their mounts
over to the jack pines and left them
with dropped reins

  then they were quickly disarmed
and bound hand and feet with lass
ropes the kid did not trouble to
gag them their shouts would not
be heard above the noise of the near-
by cattle
the whistlin kids injun brand



  in the saddle again the kid raced
around the milling herd if his luck
held he might catch the herd riders
one at a time

  but instead he came on them sit-
ting their horses side by side at the
edge of ttie dust cloud something
in his manner must have aroused
their suspicions for as he threw his
six-gun on them one hombre went
for his 

  br-an-ng bang flashes of gun-
fire lanced the thick dust like light-
ning ripping through a thunder-
cloud

  one hombre pitched headlong
from his saddle the other dropped
his unfired six-gun and clung des-
perately to his saddle horn

 five down and two to go
grimly muttered the fighting kid

  he urged the buckskin clear of
the dust the final show-down had
come

  bad luck barton and the scar-
faced outlaw had heard the shots
the waiting kid saw them both
spurring madly toward the branding
ground he knew they were dead
shots and they were coming from
opposite directions to catch him in
a murderous crossfire from their  s

  suddenly the kid wheeled his
buckskin toward the hombre coming
from the water hole speed snorted
wrathfully as the unaccustomed
sharp roll of spurs sent him plung-
ing at full stride to meet the outlaw
gunman

  the scar-faced hombre was smart
he jerked his mount to a sliding stop
and leaped from the saddle with
his horse as a bulwark he started
throwing lead at the approaching
kid

  bending low in his saddle the kid
never slackened his headlong pace
he was an expert shot from the back
of a running horse all he needed
was the right range

  wham at thirty yards the kid
cut loose

  the top of the rustlers head
showing above the saddle was his
target he saw the hombre sink
down in a limp huddle on the
ground

  just in time the kid whirled his
horse to meet a savage attack from
the rear bad-luck barton was
charging down on him like a whirl-
wind throwing lead from a six-gun
in each hand

  a bullet zupped through the high-
peaked crown of the kids gray stet-
son with a noise like a buzz saw
striking a pine knot another slug
glanced from the steel horn of the
kids saddle bad-luck had his
range

  the kids dark eyes were gleam-
ing with the light of battle with
the flashing speed of a striking rat-
tler his gun hand whipped up the
colt  it held roared once

  i know yuh now yuh snoopin
cow dick yore pete prentiss the
whistlin kid undercover man fer
the c a weakly snarled bad-luck
barton as he looked up at the
darkly tanned hawkish face of his
captor i seen yuh a couple of
years ago when yuh broke up dirk
conways gang over on the rio
blanco

  the kid finished binding a strip
of cotton shirt over a shoulder
wound of the venomous rustler chief

  yeah you named me correct
hombre he said too bad fer you
thet you couldnt recollect sooner
where youd seen me afore this
is one time bad luck comes home to
you itll cost you plenty

  an hour later the kid herded a
crestfallen band of prisoners out of
the malpais all were headed for
jail or the hangmans noose

  the kid was in good humor de-


street  smiths wild west weekly

spite the fact that he was whistling
the doleful cowboys lament
injun brand he softly chuckled
reckon injun sign would a been
more fittin to call it

hangin injun signs on rustlers is the
whistlin kids job but workin injun

brands on stolen cattle dont seem like
the right thing fer a c a cow dick ter
do until yuh realize what a rustler

got a hull lot more good tricks up his

at a hudsons bay post

  at the posts of the hudsons ray
co even those in the most remote
and lonely regions strict discipline
and an almost military routine are
observed

  one year an unusually early win-
ter paid a surprise visit to the
northwest the supply boat taking
provisions to a far-off trading post
was caught in the ice several hun-
dred miles from its destination

  this meant that the factor and
his employees would be obliged to
live on fish and game-but princi-
pally fish-for several months
when no supplies are left over from
the previous year fish is sometimes
the only article of food at these
posts and is served three times a
day

  the officials and employees of the
company become so accustomed to
this fish diet that the most common
form of an invitation to dinner was
to say

  will you come and eat fish with
me to-day

  on this occasion the factor was
lucky enough to have on hand a
large quantity of dried peas these
were a luxury and were served at
dinner only fish being the one dish
at breakfast and supper

  the factor was a strict disciplin-
arian and ruled his post with mili-
tary precision every day his faith-

ful attendant would come and knock
at the door of the office and in re-
sponse to a loud come in would
open the door and stand with un-
covered head

  well john what is it the fac-
tor would say

  please sir ive come to ask
what we are to have for dinner
john would answer respectfully and
quite seriously

  oh yes john the factor would
say turning around in his chair
that is a very important matter
let me see-let me see what did
we have yesterday john

 to this john would reply
promptly pea soup sir

  why of course so we did i re-
member now the factor did not
smile it was very good indeed-
excellent-so we will have pea soup
again to-day john

 yes sir john would back
away close the door and depart to
prepare the appetizing meal

  this daily interview was held be-
tween the factor and his attendant
every day for several months until
the ice broke and the boat got in
with a change of diet

  the conversation was repeated
with all becoming formality and
gravity and no doubt the pea soup
tasted all the better for the cere-
mony with which it was served

a grubstake fer nugget

by dean mckinley

author of fools gold on cripple creek etc

the racket in the hourglass
bunk house sounded like a
cattle stampede with clump-
ing cow boots three flannel-shirted
waddies were noisily dancing break-
downs that made the floor and walls
shake others sat on bunks and
boxes clapping their hands in time
with the music but the music-
you could scarcely hear it

  that however was no fault of
the two musicians absent mills
plunked his banjo mightily his
round red face beaded with the
sweat of honest endeavor but even
without the noise of the dancers and
hand-clappers his puny instrument
didnt have a chance against stut
hawkinss drums and traps

  for stut was wielding his nimble
drumsticks on a snare drum on a
ww-d

tripod between his knees while he
worked a pedal with one foot that
pounded a small bass drum and a
cymbal at the same time

 nor was that all stut before
coming to the hourglass had been
the trap drummer in the piute
county cowboy band and for that
job he had collected quite a com-
plete trap-drumming outfit now he
would blow a bird whistle then pull
rosined strings in hollow wooden
shells and tin cans that produced the
bark of a dog or the moo of a cow
then he would twirl a deafening
rattle his lengthy leg never letting
up on the pedal that worked the
bass drum and cymbal

  it was doubtful if the long-faced
drummer knew what tune absent
was plunking out but that made no


street  smiths wild west weekly

difference to stut he just kept
going

  but when absents chubby fingers
drew away from the banjo strings
that was stuts cue to stop too the
dancers and hand-clappers likewise
gave up the battle and paused for
breath

  hooray yelled shorty san-
ders now give us  zip coon
absent i declar im jest a-gittin
warmed up

  the chunky little banjo player
scratched his bristly dark-brown
head

  i dont recollec how she goes
he hesitatingly admitted a far-away
look in his big blue eyes i-

  y-y-y-you dont recollec noth-
noth-nothin stut disgustedly told
him l-l-l-listen yuh danged ab-
sent-minded ma-ma-maverick and
his lips puckered into a whistle that
made his gaunt bronzed face look
twice as long as it really was

  absent broke into a broad grin as
stut whistled the air of old zip
coon his fingers again plunked
the banjo stut banged the snare
drum pounded the bass drum and
cymbal blew the bird whistle
pulled the resined cord in the tin
can that produced the cow moo
the dancers went into action the
hand-clappers got in their hearty
afterbeats the bunk house rocked
with the clamor

  the door suddenly burst open
and there framed in the opening
stood the old man absents
plunking on the banjo and stuts
banging on the drums abruptly
ceased the dancers paused the
hand-clappers quit all eyes were
fixed on the rugged face and flowing
white mustache of the erect old
rancher who had so unexpectedly
burst in upon their revel

  but the smile of old man collins
and the twinkle in his kindly gray

eyes banished their fear that he had
come down from the ranch house to
reprove them for making too much
noise

  sorry ter break up yore party
boys he said i jest come down
ter tell yuh the news steve perry
jest dropped in ter the house an
told me the apache terror is out
raisin ructions agin

  huh grunted shorty mopping
his perspiring face on his red ban-
danna thet aint news whos
he kilt this time

  andy grant replied the old
rancher

  sudden silence fell in the bunk
house eyes bulged mouths gaped

  what stut was the first to
exclaim rising from his soap-box
seat his drumsticks in his hands
y-y-y-yuh mean andy g-g-grant
o the b-b-b-box diamond

  old man collins nodded found
him half dead in his ranch house
safe wide open money hed jest got

him when he was a-puttin the

  both replied the old man tug-
ging at one end of his big white
mustache but ef they ketch im
theyll be the fust ever done it thet
terrors as smart as he is pizen
likely miles away in one o his hide-
outs by this time

  who was it yuh said he kilt
innocently drawled absent frown-
ing perplexedly as he leaned over his
banjo

  yuh jest w-w-w-wakin up

barked stut his brown eyes flashing
with irritation at his banjo-playing
buddys dumb question hold
s-s-s-still an ill put yuh ter
s-s-s-sleep agin he waved a long
drumstick menacingly over absents
round head

  in spite of his suppressed grief
over the brutal murder of his neigh-
boring rancher old man collins had
to smile

  an thet aint all the news i got
he went on as if to brush away his
sordid thoughts for a moment
nugget pearsons latest gold mine
has turned out ter be another fizzle
the minin engineers thet come out
ter look it over turned it down
wh-wh-wh-what stut dropped
one of his drumsticks yuh mean

barked stut his dark shaggy eye-
brows leveling  twas you thet
kep thet paper now wh-wh-what
yuh g-g-g-gone an d-d-d-done with

  absent fished in his pockets then
got up and rummaged about in his
bunk the old man and the hour-
glass cowboys were shaking with
laughter flushing shamefacedly
absent returned to his lanky pard

  hanged ef i know what become
of it he shrugged but what
good is thet paper goin ter do us
ef nugget caint sell his danged of

  yuh overf-f-f-fed g-g-g-gopher
stuts brown eyes snapped thet

prospectin round these parts but i
reckon thars plumb few thet knows

  absent scratched his bristly head
and a smile wreathed his plump
cheeks

  say stut he suggested what
would we do with thet hundred
bucks ef nugget paid it back ter
us wed only blow it in foolish the


street  smiths wild west weekly

next time we went ter town an

morrer ter tell im the good news

the foreman

greeted the idea enthusiastically
but i never knowed nugget was

chuckled the old man didnt yuh
ever notice them scars on nuggets
face waal thets whar a cougar
clawed him if thars anythin the

  absent glanced accusingly at the

smile

   no r-r-r-really snorted stut
ab-ab-ab-absent i d-d-d-dont see
how any one c-c-c-could have the
h-h-h-heart

ii

  the next morning stut and ab-
sent saddled up after breakfast and
rode for the little shack where old
nugget lived in a lonely rocky
hollow between two steep mountain
ridges it was where the foothills
rose into the san madres range-a
wild desolate region barren of all
but the hardiest vegetation nobody
 but a solitude-loving old gold hunter
would ever have chosen such a spot
as his abode

  while the two cayuses plodded
over the rocky trail between steep
little cliffs and gigantic boulders
stut called back to absent

  wh-wh-what say we stop at
n-n-n-nuggets mine we might
f-f-f-find him up thar

  o k absent nodded he had
rolled a brown-paper quirly and was
fishing in his chaps pocket for a
match but instead he drew forth
a folded paper

  ive found it stut he cried
jubilantly nuggets receipt

  stut shook his head hopelessly
turned his horse reached out a
rangy arm

   ill t-t-t-take keer o thet paper
he said yuh aint ter b-b-b-be
trusted with yore own undershirt
pocketing the paper stut rode
along absent following in silence
they branched off the trail stut
ahead guiding his mount on a zig-
zag route between boulders and cliff
breakdowns scattered here and
there with dwarf pinons and juni-
pers their horses hoofs clattered
on the smooth shale cautiously pick-
ing their slippery footing
a grubstake fer nugget



  stut reined in thar she is-
nuggets mine he pointed to a
shoulder-high hole that gaped in a
broken-down wall of rock to his
right

  gosh exclaimed absent mills
howd the ol wampus ever gouge
thet hole out o sheer rock i never
reckoned hed put in so much work
on thet bum mine an now ter
think its-

  yuh d-d-d-didnt think he dug it

yuh stut pointed to a square red
box lying to one side of the mine
opening the cover flung open
empty d-d-d-dynamite he ex-
plained tersely

  they looked over the evidences
of mining operations around them
to their left was heaped the dump
pile of broken quartz and shale
which nugget had laboriously taken
out of the mine in his excavation
near it was a wheelbarrow and
ahead of them lay a few planks and
timber joists a shovel and a pickax

off his head and went sailing away

  gosh absent yelped some
ones bushwhackin us we-

  swinging his lengthy legs clear
stut leaped down from his saddle
out came his six-gun and he
crouched behind a boulder a bullet
spattered against the shielding
rock glancing off

  peering around the boulder stut
glimpsed a black stetson rising from
the jagged rocks above he gasped
as he recognized it it was nuggets
old stetson with a hole in the crown
and daubed on one side with white-
wash there wasnt another hat
just like it on the whole range

  taking quick aim stut fired at
it he heard the whine of the bullet
as it glanced off the stone rampart
the white-daubed black hat ducked
down

  a gasp at his side-and there
squatted absent stut glanced at
him then snapped

  git yore gun out yuh d-d-danged
fool wh-wh-what yuh s-s-s-squat-
tin hyar with yore m-m-m-mouth
open fer

  absent gulped blinked his blue
eyes i-i aint got no six-gun
he groaned i done fergot it an
left it in the bunk house

  stut grunted disgustedly of all
the d-d-d-danged brainless g-g-g-ga-
zabos on the range yuh t-t-take the
c-c-c-cake git out o hyar git on
yore h-h-h-hoss an high-tail it ill

absent  nugget wouldnt-

  n-n-n-nugget wouldnt sneered
stut waal thets him look at
thet hat when it bobs up agin he
peered around the boulder at the
ridge above watching for nuggets
black stetson and the chance for
another shot

  but why should he try ter pot
us-us who give him a helpin hand
when no one else would queried
absent

  i dunno-less its ter git thet

stut thets what he p-p-probly

  crack another bullet from the
ridge above was the answer

  absent emitted a little moan fell
flat on his back stuts brown eyes
bulged as he glanced at his prostrate
pal absents broad forehead was
streaked with blood he didnt
move

  got im a dry sob choked in
stuts throat the-the d-d-dirty
d-d-dry-gulchin polecat ill-

  heedless of bullets that could
easily pick him off stut leaped to
his feet the steep rocky slope lead-
ing up to the ridge ahead the boul-
ders strewn about the very air itself
-everything was veiled in a red
haze flying lead the murderers
secure hiding place behind the rocky
rampart-nothing held stut back
now absent was dead killed by a
treacherous bullet from that mur-
derers gun

  ill g-g-g-git thet p-p-p-polecat
grated the lanky waddy as he ran
blindly up the rocky incline slip-
ping back forging on again

  then he suddenly realized that in
his insane fury he had made the
worst move possible to avenge his
murdered buddy but it was too
late now to turn back duck behind
a boulder and play the game of
watchful waiting he was in the
open exposed to the killers lead
but why hadnt the killer cut him
down before this

  stut thought he knew-and a
grim smile creased his gaunt cheeks
his headlong charge hadnt been so
senseless so reckless after all it
had unnerved nugget the cow-
ardly old coyote had turned tail and
fled

  slipping sliding stut kept on his
six-gun held at full cock ready for a
snapshot at any instant his brown
eyes swept behind each boulder and
outcrop of rock as he scrambled up
past it he reached the outcrop

  from which the killer had opened
fire on him and absent but no one
was hidden there now stut kept
on

  ill g-g-g-git thet ol s-s-s-side-
hill g-g-g-gouger ef i hev ter ch-ch-
chase im clar inter the m-m-mount-
ings gritted the lanky avenger
ill-

  a shadowy shape lifted from be-
hind the boulder he was clumping
past panting for breath after his
climb stut whipped his six-gun
around his foot slipped-he fought
for balance

 smash down came an arm and
the barrel of a six-gun crashed
against stuts bare head with a
moan as his knees caved in under
him he passed out

iii

  he opened his eyes in pitch dark-
ness his head ached and throbbed
as he sat up piercing little lights
danced before his smarting eyes

  oh he groaned oh

  oh groaned another voice at
his side stut is thet-is thet
you

  the lanky waddys head cleared
in a flash

 absent he gasped yuh-
yuh-yuh r-r-r-really alive

 whos dumb now it was ab-
sents voice all right ending in a
faint chuckle creased-thets all
i was i reckon but-

  whar are we stut blinked his
head still throbbing vilely

  in nuggets mine i reckon re-
plied absent you an me i guess
we come to about the same time
what yuh spose thet ol wampus
nugget is flggerin on doin with
us

  stuts hand flew to his holster and
found it empty ahead far far
ahead it seemed he could see a
a grubstake fer nugget



round light-the opening to the
mine

  he aint g-g-g-goin ter do nothin
to us if we kin help it he grated
staggering to his feet if we
c-c-c-caint lick thet ol m-m-moss-
horn barehanded-

  then he remembered that nugget
had a six-gun and he hadnt the
fact that neither he nor absent was
tied up indicated that the old pros-
pector had felt reasonably sure of
himself when he dragged them into
the mine

  were bottled up shore enough
grumbled absent whatll we do
now stut

  sneak ter the mine entrance an
take a look-see come on stut
led the way he fished in his chaps
pockets but found there only his
jackknife and a rolled-up pigging
string gosh if hed only carried
an extra six-gun a derringer-any
weapon for such an emergency

  as he groped along crouching so
that he wouldnt bump his head on
the low quartz roof he paused to
examine the various objects he
stumbled over but they were all
chunks of quartz nugget had left
none of his tools there

  he picked up two of those quartz
chunks however they would be bet-
ter than nothing if it came to a
fight and stut was determined
that there would be a fight and a
hot one if they came face to face
with the murderous old nugget

  he reached the mine opening and
peered out absent close behind him
there a little to one side of the
dump where nugget had heaped up
the rubble he had removed from the
mine squatted a jasper beside a
small fire cooking a meal he had
his back partly turned toward the
mine stut muttered furiously un-
der his breath as he recognized the
black whitewash-daubed stetson on

their captors head stut didnt
have to take a second look to be
sure that it was old nugget

  like an indian stut stole ahead
gripping the two chunks of quartz
in his hands if it came to a close-
range fight with nugget he would at
least have weapons of a sort if he
could get closer yell get nugget on
his feet gamble with rocks against

six-gun bullets-

 thump the sudden noise be-
hind stut startled him like a pistol
shot absent softly swore and dis-
engaged a wooden bucket from his
foot

  the jasper beside the fire jumped
up whipped his hand around to his
long-barreled six-gun absent still
holding the bucket ran stumbling
back into the mine stut realizing
that his chance was gone followed

 yuh-yuh d-d-d-danged sprad-
dle-hoofed m-m-maverick fumed
stut when they reached the end of
the tunnel now were in fer it
thet ol p-p-p-pelican will come in

now an finish us off an-

  i didnt see thet danged bucket
groaned absent whod ever reck-
oned any oned leave a water bucket

in a gold mine it-

  stut groped found the bucket
and wrenched it out of his chunky
pals hand there was a sound of
steel being scraped on wood as he
drew out his jackknife and worked
on the bucket for a few minutes
what yuh doin asked absent
stut did not reply his eyes were
on the circle of light that marked
the mine opening as he worked
then through that circle came the
figure of a crouching man holding
a blazing pine torch in one hand a
six-gun in the other his black hat
was drawn down low over his eyes
so that stut could not see his face

  gosh hes got us hoarsely
whispered absent squeezing him-

self against the rock wall at the end
of the mine as the torchlight re-
vealed the stealthy advancing fig-
ure whatll we-

  arr-augh through the mine re-
sounded a roar that almost made the
solid rock quiver

  the advancing form stopped sud-
denly the torch lifted against the
mine roof

  arr-augh again that roar burst
out like the terrifying challenge of
a lion that is about to charge its
prey

  but the black-hatted man held his
ground still holding the light over
his head he jerked up his six-gun

  bang crash two shots thun-
dered out in quick succession ab-
sent moaned and sank to the mine
floor a bullet breezed past stuts
cheek and spattered against the
rock

  stut groaned aloud with dismay
through the powder smoke that now
filled the mine he could make out
the light of the torch the dim figure
of the man six-gun held ready for
another quick shot the man seemed
to be peering through the smoke to
see if his bullets had gone true to
their mark

  stut realized that his chances
were now slim indeed absent was
down the instant that armed man
saw that stut was still on his feet
more lead would fly and when it
did that would mean the end of
stut in that narrow space weapon-
less face to face with the killer-

  like a flash it suddenly dawned
on stut that he was still holding the
bucket he drew back his arm his
eyes fixed on the black hat the dim
face under the torchlight if he
could-

  with a snarl the killer aimed his
six-gun again through the thin-
ning smoke he must have detected
that only one of his captives was

down that the other was still on his
feet

  swish through the narrow con-
fines of the mine shot the bucket
with all stuts desperate strength
behind it it traveled like a cannon
ball if it missed its mark-if
stuts quick aim was faulty to the

fraction of an inch-

  the lanky waddys heart stood
still in that terrible instant of sus-
pense

  whack the flying bucket hit
hard

  and stuts hopes leaped high as
he glimpsed in that split second the
bucket dropping from the killers
head it had struck the exact mark
at which stut had aimed-the
killers left temple exposed by the
tilted brim of the black stetson
which had been moved slightly to
one side by scraping against the
rocky roof of the mine

  the torch fell from the killers
hand and the mine was plunged into
darkness orange-red flame darted
from the six-gun muzzle but the
bullet whined as it glanced off the
rock there was a thud as the gun-
mans body hit the floor

with a bound stut flung himself
upon the prostrate killer at the
end of the mine absent groaned
oh my arm my shoulder he

drilled-

  stut grinned relieved that his
buddy had suffered nothing worse
than a shoulder wound

  ive g-g-g-got the p-p-p-polecat
absent he called out git me a

rope g-g-go on an-

 absent stumbled over the two
figures as he staggered out of the
mine the man under stut snarled
as he recovered his senses then he
began to struggle swearing kicking
biting spitting but get loose from
those rangy arms those steel-sin-
ewed hands that had won for the
a grubstake fer nugget



lanky cowpoke the bulldogging
championship at the piute county
rodeo not a chance but even
at that old nugget was putting up
a stiffer scrap than stut had ex-
pected him to

  then absent came scuffing back
his hands full of rawhide bending
down he handed the thongs to stut
who flipped his prisoner over on his
stomach and tightly bound his
wrists behind his back then stut
trussed up his ankles and between
them the two hourglass waddies
lifted their swearing snarling cap-
tive out into the sunlight

  setting him down they stood off
and looked at him and from the
lips of both cowpokes burst gasps
of amazement

  great jumpin grasshoppers ex-
claimed absent it aint nugget
its-

  but they had seen that hard high-
cheeked swarthy face those glitter-
ing little black eyes too often on
reward posters to be mistaken
their prisoner was not old nugget
he was the apache terror

  by g-g-g-gosh stuttered the
lanky hourglass waddy running a
skinned forefinger along his lean
nose n-n-nugget must a left thet
ol black stetson in the m-m-mine
an this skunk found it thar a
d-d-d-desarted mine-thetd be the
n-n-n-naturalest p-p-place on earth
fer an outlaw on the d-d-d-dodge ter
hole up in an-

  but thet critter in the mine-
what made thet devlish noise
broke in absent gosh i reck-
oned wed holed up with a man-
eatin tiger

  stut chuckled and strode into the
mine he came out with the bucket
in his hand through its bottom a
hole had been punched and
through that hole ran a pigging
string held in by a knot that kept

the length of the string inside the
bucket

  j-j-j-jest an ol lion roar --like
the one i had in my t-t-t-trap-drum-
min outfit in the piute county
band stut explained like my
c-c-c-cow moo only bigger

  he moistened his thumb and fore-
finger and pulled them along the
string

  arr-augh the roar that he pro-
duced from the inside of the bucket
was identical with the sounds that
had echoed in the mine when the
apache terror came in for the
slaughter

  i r-r-r-reckoned thet lion r-r-roar
would m-m-make ol nugget think
a cougar had s-s-stole inter the
mine an s-s-s-skeer him out
chuckled stut but the t-t-terror
didnt s-s-s-skeer so easy anyhow
the ol b-b-bucket done itself
r-r-r-right proud it g-g-got us out
plumb alive an thets all i was

bullet proof

whistling softly to himself
the lithe elusive young hom-
bre whom this part of new
mexico had come to call the phan-
tom rider went coolly about his
work

  the night sky was overcast but
the masked youth seemed to know
every canyon and fold of the rugged
capitans as well as he did the bat-
tered old stock saddle upon his white
cay use

expertly he hazed on the few

head of cow stuff hed gathered far
back up in the heights

  they certainly werent much to
look at-scrub cattle with fantastic
old spanish brands upon their
scrawny hides-but the keen-eyed
phantom seemed well satisfied with
his haul as always he knew ex-
actly what he was about

  hi-kee-ho git along there yuh
hunk o bones he grunted quietly
as his doubled lass rope slapped a
thin critter across the rump 
juan martinezll be muy glad to see
yuh in his brush corral but we aint
there yet by a long ways we still
got us some business here on the
rockin h

  with the muttered words the
jvide rather pleasant mouth beneath
his black strip of mask took on a
steel-hard look through slitted eye
holes the phantoms level gray eyes
ranged down the mountainside un-
til they picked up a tiny glow of
ghost rider of the capitans



light that dim yellow dot marked
the distant ranch house of the rock-
ing h

  grimly bitterly the youth studied
the far-off light

  blast markly he growled aloud
toastin his shins down there
while im out here on the dodge
oh well whats the difference-for
a little while i kind o picked me
out this life

  almost unconsciously the riders
lean bronzed fingers slipped to a 
butt a turn of the phantoms vrrist
loosened the weapon in its holster so
that it could clear leather easily

  then the hard look already faded
he started on again whistling tune-
lessly under his breath the phan-
tom rider wasnt one to wear his
feelings on his face

  two hours later he was down in
the big south pasture of the rock-
ing h his little bunch of live stock
was almost doubled now

  pure-bred whitefaces had just
been added to the scrawny stuff
plug markly-crooked owner of
the rocking h-was due to lose
some fancy beef

  unhurriedly the phantom drove
his nights selection toward the big
gap hed cut in the barbed-wire
fence hed rather expected the
whitefaces would be watched after
his other raids but so far hed seen
no night guard

 that suited him exactly he
didnt sling lead unless he had to
here lately however the phantoms
gun had been kept plenty hot

  baffling and elusive quick to
strike and quicker to disappear hed
become something of a legend here
in old lincoln county in barely more
than a month

 as to who he was one mans
guess was quite as good as anothers
few had seen him except when bul-
lets flew and then always at night

 some called him outlaw some
called him friend and all called him
bullet-proof expert shots had
ripped lead straight at him with ap-
parently no effect slugs seemed to
sing- as harmlessly through him as
if he were a ghost

  indeed the superstitious mexicans
hereabouts claimed him to be just
that to them he was phantom in
fact as well as in name-the very
definite ghost of a dare-devil young
rider whom some of the oldest had
known

 the nickname they whispered
among themselves had been one held
in awe in the raw wild days when
lincoln county was young outlaw
its owner was then famous for flash-
ing guns

  in life he had helped the weak
and the poor now from out of a
slain mans grave they claimed he
was back again

  all this the phantom knew for he
had ways of his own of keeping in
touch with things in the capitans
at this moment however his atten-
tion was centered wholly upon car-
rying out his raid

  the cloud drift had split in places
moonlight came streaming through
the phantoms gray eyes swept the
landscape-a hillside lined with
deep twisting gullies

 dark reaching fingers these
seemed in the moonlights fitful
glow no one was in sight however

  the cattle reached the fence
bound for the deepest ravine once
beneath its sheltering banks-

  crash bam-m a thunderous tu-
mult of gunfire filled the air with
screaming lead bullets buzzed and
snarled in the startled phantoms
ear

  he whirled to face the onslaught
-a bunch of men spurring furiously
from the black lip of a draw

 git around him quick the


street  smiths wild west weekly

leaders harsh voice yelled cut im
off burn im down

  yuh try it markly the lithe
young rider gritted through his
teeth

  the tense hiss of the phantoms
words were lost in the instant leap
and roar of his own flashing six-gun
ten to one the odds were he saw at
a sweeping glance

 plug markly and his rocking h
crew were still about fifty yards
away the phantom might have
wheeled his speedy white cayuse and
streaked off through the night

  but he had spent long hours gath-
ering the cattle especially the scrub
stuff he didnt mean to give them
up without a stubborn fight

  the first hot blasts from his gun
brought yells from the charging men
a hard-faced hombre yelped in pain
a cayuse faltering in mid-stride
went down in a fog of dust

  other horses close behind struck
the kicking animal before their speed
could be checked down they went
in a thrashing snarl while riders
crashed to earth

  plug markly swept on raving but
the phantoms gunfire drove him
back the cattle were in wild flight
hastily reloading his heated colt
the phantom pivoted his white ca-
yuse slightly to the left

  two jaspers were spurring in from
that quarter-savage gun hands
from the rocking h a cloud rolled
over the moon the phantom
ducked beside his horse hot bul-
lets burned the night

  the moon broke through again
two men were down but not the
phantom taking advantage of the
confused tangle among his other
foes he suddenly shot off after the
speeding stock

  his gun was holstered now he
held merely his doubled rope

  quickly he forged up on the cattle

-whitefaces and scrawny scrubs--
and went furiously to work

  the rocking h pure-breds he dis-
regarded they were by far the
most valuable but rather surpris-
ingly the phantom whipped on only
the scrawny stuff a timbered little
creek lay ahead they crossed it
in full flight

 but now plug markly was com-
ing on followed by his men more
bullets ripped and whined with
the phantom hampered by the thin
spanish-branded scrubs that he was
running off the gap closed mighty
fast

  again it was a battle with the
cattle thundering unmolested down
the brushy creek coolly the phan-
tom turned again something like a
rear guard covering a retreat

  his gun slashed and flamed and
roared but this time the foe re-
fused to break

  blast it i wish i had the goods
on markly he growled id do
more than just dust his chaps

 the rocking h was smashing
through the timber now and the
phantom had no more time to wait
hed done his best with the cattle
he had to save himself

  what his motives were in his pe-
culiar raids only the phantom knew
here in the half darkness beneath
the trees with eight hombres spur-
ring at him he realized that the
time had come for flight

  well anyway ghost boy he
grunted to his white horse well
give em a close-range look-and
somethin to talk about

  a swirling dipping movement
and then his rowels swept back the
foes were charging downhill the
phantom chose to go up

  almost straight at them he sped
then swerved a fraction to the right

  his dare-devil course would carry
him past at twenty yards unless a
ghost rider of the capitans



fierce slug stopped him but the
phantom had little fear something
had happened back there in the
trees before he picked his course

  ey-yow waste yore bullets yuh
thievin curs his hot mocking
challenge rang out at the rock-
ing h

  the answer to that crisp taunt
was a furious leaden hail at the form
above the streaking horse the tar-
get wasnt clear in the darkness but
for gun hands it was certainly plain
enough

  there wasnt a slit-eyed hombre
there who couldnt have hit a mark
a tenth that size at more than twice
the distance but to their amaze-
ment the phantom flashed right on
past

  hot slugs seemed to have ripped
him through and through but he
hadnt even reeled likewise in
seeming contempt he had disdained
to shoot

  great jumpin green grasshop-
pers some jasper cried did yuh
ever see the like

  mouths open they all sat stunned
for a couple of precious seconds
then a low moan in spanish went
up one of the riders-a sturdy old
mexican vaquero-seemed white-
eyed with awe or fright

  socorro eet was heem he ex-
claimed dead these fifty years-
and now back with his guns again
mine own eyes have behol heem
eet was the keed himself

  the kid nothin plug markly
snarled jerked suddenly back to his
senses thet hombre was flesh and
blood come on men run im
down he cant be bullet-proof
by gosh he looked it ter me
a scar-faced jasper growled i give
him lead right through his gizzard
and he never even flinched

  off they thundered up the hillside
in belated pursuit but the phan-

tom had gained the lip of a draw on
that white horse he called ghost

  the rocking h saw him fade from
sight into the long ravine that was
the last glimpse they got of him al-
though their cayuses did their best

  elusive and baffling as ever the
phantom was gone in the night-

chapter ii

suspicious waddies

dolling down the capitans the
thunder of gunfire in the dark
struck loudly upon the ears of a
little group of riders the foremost
reined up at once

  hm-m-m listen to thet he ex-
claimed a regular battle sounds
like a shaft of moonlight break-
ing through clouds showed his face
alive with interest

  wide of shoulders and trim of
waist he sat his powerful chestnut
cayuse with a careless grace that
stamped him a true son of the west
a six-gun hung at his thigh in a
position that told he knew exactly
how to whip it out

  holster tilted at just the right
angle for an instant draw the
weapon lay close to slender fingers
yet one look at the riders bronzed
young face showed him no trouble
hunter

  there was firmness there and a
touch of dash tempered by level
gray eyes that could grow either
warm or cold as occasion demanded

  his chin was square his nose
strong his whole appearance vigor-
ous and keen rather than merely
handsome

  dressed in prosperous rancher
garb of gray-silk shirt beaverskin
stetson and expensive batwing
chaps he was plainly the leader of
the little group

  battle is right a red-headed
waddy behind him cried see them


street  smiths wild west weekly

quick flashes way up thar some-
bodys shore slingin lead mighty
fast and furious

  huh yuh call thet quick shoot-
in does yuh the snort of dis-
agreement came from a lanky
battle-scarred cowpoke whose long
and grizzled mustache made a gray
string in the moonlight ill be
a horned toad if i couldnt make
me ol six-gun talk fastern the hull
caboodle of em

  yuh mean yore mouth buck
the freckled redhead jeered with a
grin that went from one big bat
ear to the other his huge hawk
beak of a nose sniffed in derisive
fashion

  buck foster the lanky waddy
glowered he and joe scott top
hands for the circle j were con-
tinually snapping at each other

 before buck could think of a
sharp reply however the fourth
member of the party-a slant-eyed
little chinaman-squeaked out in
broken english

  that shootee coming lis way
half fearfully he looked at his boss
what we blettah do mistlee
billy

  sit tight--and mind your own
business the answer from the
bronzed young leader to the outfits
chink cook was crisp decisive at
least until we find out what its all
about i reckon

  billy west in new mexico on a
cattle-buying trip for his home
ranch in far-off montana wasnt the
kind to horn in on any deal until he
knew his ground

  although his words had been
flung at sing lo the chink he meant
them mainly for hot-headed buck
foster

  buck battered of face and broken
of nose was an impulsive old ran-
nihan who figured no fight should
ever be private he loved battle for

its own sake as much as he loved
to argue

  sure enough the scrappy range
veterans next words were eager and
impetuous

  say boss he cried lets ride
up thar a ways mebbe we kin
help thet might be some low-down
thievin rustlers what honest folks
am chasin

  yep and it might not billy
west rapped promptly sit tight
like i said thet rumpus is cornin
this way

  grumbling buck foster dropped
his hand from the worn butt of his
revolver suddenly the gunfire
ceased up there on the hillside

  a rumble of hoofs broke out like
cattle in full flight then the fir-
ing began again faster and more
furious only soon to stop com-
pletely

  looks like its over said joe
they either got him whoever he
was or else he shore got plumb
away them cattle are cornin on
though hadnt we better stop em
billy

  right-o here they come round
em up yuh waddies

  with expert quickness the mon-
tana saddle pards whirled their
horses to the work scrawny cow
critters their tongues hanging from
their run had lumbered out of the
darkness and sought to surge on
past

  double lariats took them across
their noses forced them in upon one
another and soon had them churn-
ing in a milling mass breathing
heavily the cattle stopped

  waal ill be a horned toad if i
ever seen such a mess o hide and
bones buck foster cried as he
looked them over in the faint light
anybody whatd rustle critters like
these am jist plain locoed

  the others thought so too but
ghost rider of the capitans



now more cattle-pure-bred white-
faces-had loomed up in the night
swiftly these were gathered in and
added to the bunch

  hold em steady billy ordered
while i fire some signal shots
three times his six-gun cut loose
into the air like his saddle pards
the young boss of circle j figured he
was doing some honest rancher a
good turn by rounding up the stock

  soon the sound of riders came
thundering down the slope they
swept to a halt-hard-faced men
whose hands still gripped their s

  they lowered their guns however
when they saw the cattle gathered
in a compact waiting bunch

  howdy men said billy we
heard yore racket up there and
stopped this little stampede i take
it this is yore stuff

  yeah much obliged the
leaders grunt was short he was
a long horse-faced hombre whose
close-set eyes gave him a crafty look
danged outlaw tried ter run em
off im plug markly own the
rockin h

  billy a keen judge of character
was anything but taken with the
man still he didnt doubt the jas-
pers word like the pure-bred
herefords the horse of every rider
plainly bore a rocking h

  outlaw huh buck foster
echoed marklys words i knowed
it from the start waal what in the
heck am yuh wastin time fer he
flung excitedly at the rancher lets
go run down thet thar galoot

  i will some day blast him
the hombre spat out the words like
an oath this is the fourth time
hes raided me in darn near lessn
a month

  by heifers i wouldnt wait fer
no some day then the circle j
waddy cried a rustler am a rus-
tler and ought ter be strung up

  ah yes my friend but that ees
eempossible a husky voice ob-
jected its rich spanish accent pro-
nounced one cannot hang a
ghost

  bucks huge brown eyes stared at
the speaker-the one vaquero among
these hard-bitten hombres from the
rocking h

  a what the cowpoke roared
a ghost yuh-yuh mean a
hant

  the battle-scarred veterans ardor
for a prompt pursuit was cooling
fast buck was a superstitious mav-
erick he feared no man on earth
but he sure shied off from ghosts

  si senor the leathery old mex
was nodding vigorously folks
call heem the phantom rider but
we mexicans here in lincoln county
-ah we know who he ees even
much bettair so than that he ees
beel-

  bosh markly struck in with a
growl pablo yore people are
fools he turned to the montan-
ans

  these derned ignorant spicks
he explained shortly have got it
inter their dumb heads thet the
phantom is moren jest a danged
slick cow thief they think hes
the ghost of the most famous outlaw
new mexico ever saw-thet gun ter-
ror billy the kid 

  help me hannah billy the
kid buck fosters long jaw
sagged with the explosive words
here was a name to conjure with-
the quickest most deadly shot the
frontier had ever known

  to buck it didnt matter that the
daring young outlaw had been dead
these many years in fact that
made it worse

  here the popeyed veteran told
himself hed been about to go
faunchin headlong to tangle with
billys ghost the very thought


street  smiths wild west weekly

made him shiver he broke out in
a sweat

  si billy the keed and why
not pablo insisted stoutly thees
was his home here he lived and
fought here he have hees good
friends now he ees back to help
the weak ah that billy the keed
the mexican was growing excited
with the fervor of his own words
beyond a doubt he believed to the
depths of his being everything he
said

  me i saw heem once in ol lin-
coln town when i was ver-ry small
boy he cried i saw heem again
to-night he was the ver-ry same
me-pablo sanchez-i could not
shoot although he pass me close
not me-against the keed

  well i shot somebody growled
and hit im time and agin seen
my bullets dust him on both sides
and all he done was laugh he may
not be a ghost but if he aint i shore
wish somebodyd tell me what he is
plug markly snorted yore all
a bunch of old women when a
mans dead he stays dead yuh
missed him clean he snarled
now git them cattle goin back on
the rockin h

  his men moved to obey buck
foster seemed to come out of his
staring trance

  whew boss he muttered to
billy jist think what i might a
done took out after thet thar
danged gun-slingin ghost

  yuh dont believe all thet do
yuh billy asked with a laugh he
himself had heard the rocking hs
story with interest but his conclu-
sion was vastly different from
bucks

  the clear-headed young circle j
boss had no belief in spooks some
clever rustler he figured had simply
made monkeys out of the rock-
ing h

  under ordinary circumstances
billy would have been all for joining
forces in running down a thief but
somehow his dislike for markly had
grown despite the fellows few re-
marks

  the man was mean-eyed ungra-
cious and had a sly harsh look
about him that billy didnt like
and now from near the cattle there
came word snatches that added to
that vague distrust

  senor markly the voice of pa-
blo cried here are some cows not
ours those vacas with the spanish
brands i know them well they
are-

  shut up yuh fool the horse-
faced rancher hissed yore busi-
ness is ter drive cows not ter spill
loose talk

  then as if realizing that his voice
must have carried to the circle j
men markly came riding back
suspiciously his eyes ran across
them trying to probe their thoughts

  i buy a lot o cattle he growled
fastern some o my dumb hands
kin keep up with the stock

  billy west said nothing but al-
ready he was beginning to think that
the mysterious phantom rider
might not be the only one on the
rustle hereabouts

  buck foster however horned in
with a prompt remark

  kind o buyin some cattle our-
selves he bragged thets why
were down hyar lookin fer feeder
stuff

  say thets fine markly unbent
at once hova about buyin some
from me thet spanish-branded
stuffll put on weight fast if yuh
feed it right ill let yuh have em
cheap

  yeah billy wests tones were
dry here was a chance to see if his
growing suspicion was correct
what do yuh mean by cheap

ww-d
ghost rider of the capitans



  twenty-five dollars a head

  the young montanan merely
laughed

  twenty then markly grunted
his eyes greedy in the moonlight

  the circle j boss shook his head
if markly came any lower he would
know it was rustled stuff

  fifteen and thets final the
horse-faced jasper snarled

  the price was cheap-too cheap

  nope billy answered i dont
want em i guess

  an angry look gripped marklys
face but quickly he forced it aside

  say come up ter the house fer
the night then the fellow growled
at last if yuh dont want the
scrubs mebbe we kin do business
about the pure-bred stuff thet is
he added craftily if yuh got money
enough

  got plenty o money buck fos-
ter blurted with a promptness that
made plug marklys close-set eyes
gleam with an eager light

  rapidly billy made up his mind
markly he saw was a crook then
what about the phantom rider
flashed through the young waddys
thoughts

  was it simply a case of one rustler
preying upon another or did this
situation here in the old home of
billy the kid go much deeper
than that

  all right snapped billy ill
go

  he meant to have a further talk
with old pablo sanchez about the
entire affair when he got the chance
some time during the night

chapter iii

trouble in the night

delly didnt get that chance how-
ever markly rode close to pa-
blos side while the regathered cattle
were being corralled in a good-sized
ww-d

branding pen not far from the house
then the lanky rancher sent the
mexican about some other work

 now well talk about them
whitefaces he growled to billy
when they had reached the house

  the session was a long one but it
came to naught markly wanted
such a stiff price for the pure-breds
that billy quickly realized that they
at least were not rustled stuff

  markly on his part seemed try-
ing to ferret out how much cold cash
billy carried cattle buyers usually
went well heeled especially if they
were strangers who might have diffi-
culty cashing checks

  until nearly midnight the pair
argued back and forth in a battle
of probing wits more and more the
circle j owner read the character of
the man before him markly was
crafty on the surface underneath
he was worse than that

  when balked in his cunning at-
tempts to gain information his eyes
burned with a killer light hard
surly probably vicious he seemed
to billy mighty closely akin to the
tough gun-slinging type hed gath-
ered about him on the ranch

  a crook and a killer if there ever
was one the circle j boss decided
whoever thet phantom rider is he
certainly cant be as bad as this
close-eyed snake

  then their fruitless session ended
billy got to his feet

  well theres no use dickerin any
more thet i can see he said i
guess ill turn in where do yuh
want us to sleep

  plenty of room upstairs markly
grunted with something of a rasp
this is a big old shack most o
my riders sleep in the house

  billy wanted to ask if pablo did
also but didnt want to risk such a
direct question it might arouse
suspicion some way he figured


street  smiths wild west weekly

hed make an opportunity to see
that sturdy old mex

  upstairs he trooped with buck
joe and sing lo markly followed
holding a lamp and directed them to
their rooms

  billy said nothing when he noted
that his pards were put at one end
of a long corridor he himself at the
other

  nevertheless he was already sus-
picious enough to take no risks with
the well-filled money belt he wore
beneath his shirt

  waiting until plug markly had
clumped on back downstairs billy
removed his boots and tiptoed up
the bare hall toward his pards the
lusty snores of marklys riders came
to him from the rooms he passed

  sing lo he whispered after a
soft tap on the door come here a
minute i got a pair o jobs for
you

  the little oriental appeared al-
most at once the hall was dark
here billy stripped off his money
belt

  strap this around yuh he di-
rected i aint takin no chances on
this tough set o coyotes theyll
never figger yuh for the circle j
bank though he added with a
grin

  so be sing lo murmured me
heap plenty good place you look
flo tlouble bloss

  it wouldnt surprise me im also
lookin for that pablo mex you
slip out soon and see if he sleeps in
the bunk house hed probably be
one o the jaspers what wouldnt get
accommodations in the house

  sing lo nodded me flind him
bloss then come tellee you huh

  thets it dont let anybody see
yuh though i got a hunch some
jaspers may be on the prowl to-
night

  the circle j boss slipped back to

his room he might have gone in
search of pablo himself but he had
full confidence in the chink

  furthermore billy wanted to be
right here on the ground to see for
himself if markly tried any crooked
stuff

  crawling into bed with his hand
near his gun billy settled himself to
wait faint moonlight lighted the
room the round white porcelain
knob on the inside of his door
showed plainly in the gloom

  billys keen gray eyes fastened
upon the knob if things went as
he expected it would-some time
during the night-slowly begin to
turn

  an hour went by however with
nothing happening another hour
dragged on

  billys gaze rarely left the white
blob of the knob until the night was
three fourths gone then without
realizing it he began to nod

 that gleaming knob-like the
glass ball that a hypnotist some-
times uses to induce slumber in an
hombre-had been gazed upon too
long sleep crept upon billy un-
awares his heavy eyelids closed

 how long he dozed he never
knew but morning wasnt far off
the moonlight nearly gone when
suddenly he came awake some one
was in the room

  with a startled grunt billy west
grabbed for his  the dark form
moved just as quickly it reached
billy and the streak of bright moon-
light almost in a bound

  dont shootee me bloss dont
shootee the squeal came from
sing lo

  the little chink was trembling all
over after his headlong rush to iden-
tify himself his slanting eyes rolling
wildly at the leveled gun

  lis is just me he cried still
fearful that billy might not have
ghost rider of the capitans



recognized him dont shootee
chinkee beflo you know him

  i wont billy lowered his gun
as yuh ought to know dang
but yuh gave me a start i de-
served it though

  mistlee billy give me two start
the little man said with a sickly
yellow grin sing los heart go
pit-pat-pat him know you fast
with gun bloss he said me
dome back to leport no can find
pablo

  hm-m-m billy mused looked
everywhere did yuh suddenly he
was beginning to wonder if anything
could have happened to that old va-
quero

  evelywhere the circle j cook
announced me even peep into all
homblays looms

  billy smiled well i hardly
wanted yuh to run thet risk meb-
be pablo is out on night herd if
so hell soon be back itll be light
before long i reckon you might as
well give me that money belt sing
lo and-

  abruptly billy checked his words
far up the hall outside a board had
popped as if beneath some cautious
trtid

  sh-h-h billys quick whisper
warned the chink to silence
sounds like some hombre on the
prowl

  indeed it proved to be the
stealthy sounds continued on a
straight ever-nearing course that
brought them foot by foot to
billys door

  he was out of bed now gun in
hand waiting coolly grimly in the
center of the floor

  the doorknob rattled slightly
then it began to turn

  behind billy sing lo his slanting
yellow face tense and excited in the
dying moonlight hugged his arms
tight in about his waist

  the money belt was there none
too confidently sing lo hoped he
could protect it if the worst came
to the worst

  say whatre yuh tryin thar
the words ripped out from up the
hall

  there was a rush of feet the thud
of bodies meeting the crash of bat-
tling hombres slammed hard against
the door

  billy reached it in a leap hed
recognized that voice joe scott
was out there tangling with the
stealthy prowler from far back up
the corridor buck fosters throaty
bellow rang out in a roar

  billy jerked the door open in time
to see joe scott-his red head weav-
ing bobbing-slam home a terrific
punch as he got in beneath a burly
jaspers guard

 that hombre doubled with a
grunt he was a big hulking-jawed
brute whom billy had never seen be-
fore

  his face torn with pain the jasper
tried to whip out a gun

  yuh would would yuh joe
gritted through set teeth

  bam his hard right fist took the
gasping hombre square upon the
jaw the fellow reeled to the head
of the nearby stairs but now his
gun was out

  crack spat before the snarling
tough could fire a pair of fists-
slung by two different young wad-
dies-had smashed him both at
once

  joes got him on the temple
billys-with all his leaping weight
behind it-crashed hard against the
chin point

  the hombres hands flew wide
and he lunged backward as if he had
been shot

  down the stairs he scooted
knocked plumb out as cold as a
sledge-tapped beef


street  smiths wild west weekly

  yow-ee let me at the varmint
a lanky saddle-bowed form in his
underclothes went flying past the
pair

  buck foster grizzled mustache
bristling like the quills on a porcu-
pine was down the stairs and on the
bouncing jasper before he came to a
stop

  jump the circle j will yuh yuh
wall-eyed galoot he howled help
me hannah ill show yer how ter
fight

  without even noticing that the
fellow was already out buck hauled
off and popped him twice then the
veteran swaggered proudly to his
feet

  come on down he called up to
his pards i done put this bird on
ice

  they came down all right doors
had burst open everywhere half
dressed punchers came tumbling out
six-guns in their hands their staring
faces tough

  plug markly on the scene from
below swung on billy west

  say whats the meanin o this
he snarled gangin one o my
men looks like-

  gangin one of yore thieves yuh
mean joe scott cut in hotly

  like buck the big-beaked circle
j waddy was in his underclothes his
red hair rumpled his blue eyes like
flashing sparks

  i caught this jasper tryin ter git
into my bosss room the redhead
rasped after his money belt

  correct snapped billy west
the tanned young ranchers voice
had the sharp crack of a whip i
was waitin for him myself what
dyuh know about this markly
evervthing i suppose

  who me why i dont know
nothin that horse-faced hombre
protested at once before the hot
blaze in billys eyes he drew back

why-er-er plug stammered
heck dont go on the prod west
this hyar danged fool is drunk

  stooping markly grabbed his
stunned ruffian by the shoulder and
pulled him half erect

  the fellow was beginning to come
to now dazedly he looked around
him feeling his jaw

 markly rammed his own face
close into the jaspers with a savage
hiss

  home again drunk are yuh
one of the ranchers eyes drew down
in a signaling wink by gosh i
got a good notion ter fire yuh stay-
in out all night and then blunderin
inter my guests rooms by mistake

  the rocking h owners acting
was good but it didnt fool billy
west it did however seem to con-
fuse the still groggy tough

  say whatre yuh talkin about
that battered hombre gasped i
aint drunk i done jist what yuh
told-

  shut up dont give me no back
talk

  markly hurled in quick roaring
words to drown out the others dazed
remarks

  that settles you round hyar
the rancher roared durkin yore
fired go git yore war bag and
then yuh plumb make tracks

  durkins bruised jaw sagged
why yuh dirty double-crossin
crook he snarled then suddenly
broke off

  this time the slow-witted jasper
had caught his bosss frantic wink
his head dropped in his hands

  dang he moaned im sick

  sick er not yore fired markly
snapped eat breakfast then be
off

  a smirk of satisfaction had shown
for an instant on that long horse
face

  im sorry west the slick ranch
ghost rider of the capitans



owner apologized durkin hyar
has always been a pest

  billy took time to frame his an-
swer after all he knew he could
prove nothing even though he
wasnt deceived in the least

  he had just made up his mind to
appear to accept the explanation
when suddenly the ranch yard rang
to the steely thud of hoofs

  gravel swished and rattled as a
horse was yanked to a stop run-
ning boot heels smote the ground
the next moment pablo sanchez
burst in upon the group

  the phantom rider again senor
markly he cried the keeds
ghost have come back

chapter iv

    back yuh mean outside
his hand flew to his gun his
face was twisted in wrath

  no not outside pablo cried
quickly he have come and gone

news he raged and fumed and
swore for a full minute he had no
control of himself then he rasped at
the mex

  yuh and rip let him take em

pen dont stand thar and bat yore

  the grizzled vaquero drew him-
self up half angrily at the words

the well-bred member of his race

rip he ees try to shoot he ex-
plained billy the keeds ghost

planation

tler he howled i think yore in

  old pablos dark eyes flashed he
had been as faithful as he could ac-
cording to his lights angrily he
snapped back

with a murderers bullet yo do not
fool the people hereabouts senor
markly they suspect many are

certain that-

  why yuh danged mouthy fool
the words ripped out with vicious
force ill kill yuh fer thet

  marklys face was a thing of
deadly rage as the six-gun he held
snapped up old pablo gave a sharp
cry

  the weapon roared-wildly for a
swift bronzed young hand had shot
out and grasped marklys wrist with
a grip as tight as it was fast

  a colt  produced with a light-
ning blur was already prodding the
rancher hard beneath the heart
billy wests crisp voice cracked
one more move like thet one
markly and yore plumb likely to
be a dead snake

  the horse-faced hombre gasped
his eyes rolled in a mixture of ter-
ror and amazement

  billys weapon bored in tight
drop thet gun the firm-jawed
waddy hissed

  markly obeyed his fingers limp


street  smiths wild west weekly

the jasper was green around the
lips

  his own men had dug for six-guns
but now a hot voice cut at them like
a lash

  drag iron and yuh git lead fer
breakfast yuh danged sneakin pole-
cats joe scott talkin with his six-
gun ready ter take up right whar he
leaves off

  the redheads gun wove back and
forth across the motionless group

  buck foster almost as quick had
his own old hogleg out its black
mouth seeming to loom up like a
cannon as he threw down on the
toughs

  draw dern ye draw the vet-
eran roared help me hannah if
i aint honin ter blow up a mess o
skunks

  no one attempted to draw how-
ever hard-boiled though they
were the rocking h crew knew
enough not to take chances with
such a pair the faces of both buck
and joe were fierce with eagerness
and fight

  snarling muttering oaths the gun
toughs backed away markly re-
leased by billy finally got his voice
back

  whatre yuh all gawkin thar
fer he howled to cover his own de-
feat thet phantom has got my
cattle saddle up and run him down
hes got a two-hour start

  with the words the long jasper
rushed out toward the horse corral
his men followed him with a rush
theyd had enough of circle j in
less than five minutes the whole
bunch including the fake drunk
durkin were spurring through the
dawn to take up the phantoms
chase

  they weel nevair catch heem
old pablo said with simple positive-
ness that ees eempossible the
ghost of billy the keed he vanish

when he want to-poof the old
man snapped his fingers just lak
that

  say does yuh really believe all
thet joe scott cried while he
possessed a bit of superstition him-
self the sorrel-top wasnt at all sure
about that phantoms being a ghost

  es verdad eet ees the truth
the leathery mex declared with deep
earnestness the phantom just
lak the keed in old days he help
the poor against the rich those
cattle wid the spanish brands they
are not senor marklys they be-
long to poor mexicans by thees
time i bet yo the keed have take
them back

  waal ill be a horned toad
buck grunted what does yuh
know about thet

  i know billy west snapped
with something of a grim smile
thet markly shore doesnt seem to
need our help if those cattle were
stolen they certainly ought to go
back

  what interests me most he
went on turning to pablo is what
yuh meant by accusin markly of
buyin this ranch with a murderers
bullet did he kill some hombre to
get the rockin h

  the little gray-haired old vaquero
didnt answer at once when at last
he spoke his voice held a strange
tinge of regret

  i should not have said eet maybe
-in the hotness of my tempair eet
is not wise to accuse widout real
proof but the so fine old gentle-
man what own thees place before he
ees disappear folks theenk that he
was shot

  and markly done it huh buck
foster blurted out by heifers
aint thar no law in this country
lets go hang thet skunk

  pablos answer was an expressive
shrug there ees law all right
ghost rider of the capitans



but as i have say there ees no
proof the body have nevair been
found people they just suspect

  under billys urging the aged va-
quero began to give a more detailed
account

  according to his story old jim
hannah former owner of the place
had sold out to markly and one
gyp thain-a professional gam-
bler and card shark-for a good-
sized wad of cash

  the next day hannah had set out
north he was never seen again
but nearly a week later his cayuse
bearing a saddle with dried red
stains upon it was found far up in
the capitans

  folks put two and two together
only markly and gyp thain had
known about that cash

  senor markly he have bad repu-
tation for long old pablo said sim-
ply senor thain he have even
worse he ees tall dark flashy
hombre who run the pay dirt sa-
loon up here at next town arriba
he have keel men wid queeck throw
of hees knife

  arriba eh said billy why
thets where we were headed a
knife-thrower huh then thain
might have done thet killin him-
self

  old pablo nodded that would
not surprise me either way he de-
clared they both claim at first
that senor hannah have just gone
on about hees business but now
they make big talk eet ees the phan-
tom what have keel him that ees
all big lie the keed was not yet
come back when that murdaire was
done

  the old mans eyes flashed fiercely
with his concluding words pablo
sanchez was certainly a stanch sup-
porter of his ghost the kid

  shore the hant never done it
buck foster announced as posi-

tively as if he knew all about the
whole affair he am a downright
decent ghost id say

  yeah joe scott jeered the
lanky veteran mebbe yuh thinks
so much of him yuh wants ter throw
in with him thet shore would be
some pardnership buck foster and
a ghost haw-haw-haw he roared

  buck glared at the redhead who
was bent over with his mirth

  thets right go on and bray yuh
danged long-eared burro the
grizzled cowpoke snorted yuh
aint got no sense me an thet
phantomd make a durned good
team we both helps poor folks

gether yuh couldnt be dragged

and see buck was so indignant
that he was yanking fiercely at his
prized mustache with both hands
the fust chance i gits im goin ter
meet up with thet thar hant
well said billy with a smile
mebbe well meet him on the way
to town come on now get yore
hosses weve saved my money
belt

  soon they were riding away
headed for arriba where billy had
heard that some good stock might
be had they had had a night of
adventure but there billy supposed
the matter would end

  they had no proof on markly
crook though they knew him to be
as for the phantom billy was con-
tent to let him keep the rocking h
rancher running around in circles 
and pawing at his head

  like old pablo he didnt think
that the elusive young night rider
would be caught and markly cer-
tainly deserved to lose all his stolen
stock

  the vaquero jogged along with


street  smiths wild west weekly

them for now he had no job be-
low them in the morning light lay
the lower slopes of the capitans a
clear little stream sparkled far
away in the sun

  the rio bonito it was its banks
dotted with the occasional dobes of
small mexican ranchers in the
tangy new mexico atmosphere
everything seemed peaceful and se-
rene

  say billy suddenly asked old
pablo what about thet other night
herder who was with yuh-thet fel-
lah rip somebody or other yuh
said the phantom knocked him out
its jist struck me thet he never did
show up

  pablo shrugged rip was tough
gunman when i regain my senses
he ees gone maybe he try to chase
the phantom maybe the phantom
has take heem quien sabe who
knows

  shore said joe bucks pard-
ner got him thets all

  aw yuh go ter grass the vet-
eran growled as the others laughed
some o these days shore enough
ill throw in with thet hant

  sing lo drew a yellow eyelid down
at joe in a sly wink 

  mistlee foster him heap clazy
the little chink said blandly so
be him plenty loco

  the walrus-mustached cowpoke
popped up in his stirrups like a red-
faced jack-in-the-box

  why-why-say yuh ugly pot-
wrastlin heathen he sputtered fu-
riously yuh make another crack
like thet and ill jist natcherly tear

yuh plumb-

  an excited exclamation from pa-
blo the -vaquero cut off the veteran
short down the hillside the old
mexican had extended a stabbing
finger

  look look he cried the
phantom

  whar bucks jaw had sagged
at once

  there down near the bonito
see heem whooping along those
cattle eet ees heem he always
rides that beeg white horse

  all eyes had swept in the direc-
tion indicated sure enough a
lithely riding figure was hazing a
bunch of stock across the little
stream he was working swiftly as
if his time was short

chapter v

the phantom at work

dilly wests gray eyes flashed
with an eager light a mystery
always intrigued him especially one
of the range quickly his spurs
flicked back

  come on he shouted and thun-
dered down the slope

  the circle j boss had a keen de-
sire to get near that baffling phan-
tom and see him at close range if
once he beheld him closely billy
felt that he could tell for himself
whether this bullet-proof jasper was
a real outlaw or not

  behind him joe scott was pound-
ing along at once pablo made no
move neither did sing lo for the
little oriental was as superstitious
almost as buck

  as for that grizzled veteran he
didnt know what to do he had
made his brags about the ghost but
talking was one thing and acting
another buck was still plenty leery
about getting near a hant

  waal whatre yuh waitin fer
yuh skeery ol woman joe yelled
back a jeering taunt thars yore
pard down thar aint yuh goin ter
give him no help

  that gibe decided buck he just
had had to make a show of getting in
the play

he rammed back his spurs but
ghost rider of the capitans



lie took care to see that they struck
only his saddle cinch he didnt
want his cayuse to tear down on
that hant too fast

  the rider below heard them com-
ing and threw back a hurried look
they were still nearly a quarter of a
mile away working like fury he
rushed the cattle across the stream
and into the trees and brush upon
the farther bank

  go to it my friend billy
grunted yuh may be fast but i
think im ridin the better horse

  by this time phantom and stock
had disappeared billy forged on
down expecting at any moment to
see them bob up again upon the
farther slope

  but they didnt reappear billy
his pards left well behind plunged
into the tangle of willows along the
stream in a moment more he was
across

  the jacal or small hut of a mexi-
can loomed before him dust rose
from a brush corral

  as billy sped to it and saw that
it held only scrub cattle a man
burst from the house

  excitement was in his seamed
brown face he was waving his
hands and crying

  they have come back again my
vacas my cows i am a rancher
once more ten thousand million
thanks i give to that so good
ghost

  then the eyes of the rejoicing
mexican fell upon billy west

  what yo do here he cried
yo try to follow the ked yuh
try to catch heem he accused
diantre he hissed fiercely get
yo off my place

  whoa friend billy returned
yuh neednt get all het up i dont
mean thet phantom any harm but
where did he go he vanished like
a flash v

  the old mexican nodded smiled
of course he vanish he always
vanish i no see heem at all
billy looked around quickly
hoofmarks led up the stream

  some distance up the bonito a
white streak caught his eye the
phantom had broken from cover on
a sharp cut back to the hills

  a brushy canyon gave down be-
fore him riding like a whirlwind
he would soon be in that draw

  billy whirled danger with a
frantic cry the old mexican leaped
for the chestnuts bit

  no no he shouted hanging
on with all his might let heem
go he ees good hombre he ees
poor juans friend

  i reckon yore right said billy
weve got no right to crowd him
after all i guess

  the circle j owner reined down
to keep from dragging the mex

  joe scott just splashing into the
no had likewise wheeled his mount
toward the fleeing rider the red-
head jerked a gun but the distance
was much too far for the longest
six-gun work

 the keen-eyed phantom must
have seen the movement however
for he whipped a rifle from a saddle
boot the weapon leaped to his
shoulder and spoke with a mocking
crack

  the song of a bullet whined over-
head yet the slug didnt seem to
have been thrown with any inten-
tion to hit

  then a wave of his arm and the
phantom was gone to the relief of
old juan the mex

  let him go joe billy called
ive kind o changed my mind
ive just seen some of his work
the seamed face of juan martinez
grew into a wreath of smiles he
nodded vigorously

  si si he cried yo are muy

wise hombre nevair seek to follow
the ghost

  by this time buck foster had
come pounding down

 dem he growled he got
away thar aint no speed in me
hoss

  joe scott laughed on a jeering
note yuh mean thar aint no zip
in buck when it comes ter chasin
a ghost ive seen yuh do some
mighty fancy ridin on thet thar ca-
yuse

  buck snapped back an angry de-
nial that he hadnt done his best
immediately the two were engaged
in a heated jawing match

  they were still at it hammer and
tongs when at length sing lo and
pablo showed up that pair had
taken their time in coming down

  billy watching them had seen
them stop for a bit and go poking
about a brush heap well up the
mountain slope

 what took yuh so long he
asked it looked to me like yuhd
found somethin up there in thet
brush

  so be bloss sing lo replied
we find dead cow what somebody
had shot maybe it was that phan-
tlom what wanted it fo beef
shore buck foster who was
getting the worst of it with joe hur-
ried to chime in at once thet
phantom must a done it hes a
plumb smart homlye he jist
wanted him some meat

  yuh danged ignorant ol badger
the circle j redhead snickered
dont yuh know a hant dont eat
buck glared -heck no i dont
know it he flared sticking hotly
to his guns if yuh wasnt so
durned ignorant yoreself yuhd
know a hant kin do anything he
wants to the phantom done the
steer-killin ill bet me hat

  the others laughed all except

pablo the leathery old vaquero he
seemed to take bucks stubborn re-
marks at their face value for he
protested at once

  oh no eet could not have been
the keed that was cow of poor
man shot long time ago no meat
have been taken the phantom
would not do that

  well i dont think its worth ar-
guing over billy west announced
probably just some crippled steer
its owner shot to put out of its mis-
ery or diseased mebbe since he
didnt take its meat

  dismissing the matter as of no
consequence the young boss of
circle j resumed his journey with
his pards and old pablo toward the
town of arriba

  the place when they sighted it
about two hours- later lay in a
pocket of the capitans well beyond
that part of the range toward which
the phantom had seemed headed

  the towns long crooked main
street twisted from the pay dirt sa-
loon at one end to a squat dobe
structure housing arribas one bank
at the other cow ponies lined
hitch racks in between the rocking
h brand prominent among them

  billy went at once to the bank
for in cattle country it is usually
the local banker who knows best
those ranchers who are buying and
selling

  the rest of the circle j drifted
rather naturally into the towns
chief place of amusement-the pay
dirt

  now look a hyar chink buck
foster informed sing lo impor-
tantly as they clumped in yuh
aint goin ter do no drinkin yuh
know yuh caint handle yore liquor
like a veteran yuh lay offn thet
tanglefoot as yuh calls it

  the slant-eyed little oriental
looked highly disappointed whisky
ghost rider of the capitans



was one of his two greatest weak-
nesses the other being poker the
pay dirt had promised both but
here buck who loved to act bossy
was being a wet blanket right at the
start

 sing lo just take um one
dlinkee the yellow-faced little cook
protested lat will do him good
then he play some ploker

  waal if yuh was as slick with
yore liquor as yuh are with cards
snorted buck yuh could have thet
drink but yuh aint so yuh jist
gits what joe always takes-saspar-
iller

  sing lo argued the matter of
course but for once buck foster
was right the veteran had a sort
of standing order from billy to see
that the chink stayed sober

  giving in reluctantly sing lo
took his soft drink along with joe
buck downed the single slug of
stronger stuff which that hard-bitten
old waddy allowed himself then
rolled his fierce brown eyes about
him

  say he growled to the bar-
tender aint this hyar pay dirt sa-
loon run by an hombre named gyp
thain what is half owner o the
rockin h 

  si senor thain own thees place
the barkeep-a short pock-marked
mex-made answer there he ees
at poker table did yo weesh to
speak wid heem

  a dirty finger had pointed toward
a tall flashily dressed hombre mak-
ing the pasteboards sing beneath his
slender fingers

  buck saw at once that gyp thain
looked every inch the slick profes-
sional gambler a big diamond ring
shone on each hand an elaborate
horseshoe pin of diamonds glittered
in his necktie his eyes were like
diamonds too-hard icy brittle

  his face was dark a cold frozen

poker mask that folks said hid many
things of smooth and crafty cunning
they didnt say it aloud however
as quick to strike as a rattler gyp
thain was deadly dangerous

  naw i dont want ter talk to
him buck blurted to the barkeep
i jist wanted ter git a look at the
crooked son of a gun they tells
me him and markly was mixed up
in thet hannah killin

  shut up yuh fool joe hissed
in the veterans ear does you
want ter start a heap o trouble
thar aint no proof ter thet hyar
barkeep give me another glass of
saspariller the redhead called for
the pock-marked mex had begun
moving toward the poker table

  joe cool and level-headed could
see no need for stirring up a row
with nothing to be gained by so do-
ing

  the bartender came back his
dark eyes glittering in their deep
sunken pockets joe kept him busy
dishing out drinks that the waddy
didnt want meantime sing lo
had sidled over to the poker players

  is this game open game he
asked eagerly anybody can get
in him so be maybe

  thains cold black eyes-as hard
as agates-shot over the bland-faced
cook in an appraising glance the
faintest trace of a smile tinged the
tight lips of the gambler here
looked like an easy victim

  its open if you got money
enough he said coldly

  gyp thain who had many irons
in the fire never overlooked a
chance to add to his profits

  chinkee got plenty of dinero
him wantee play him feel lucky
hell need luck somebody
sneered far down at the end of the
bar as thain waved the chink to a
seat and inside of ten minutes
the little oriental knew it

a hunch

eanwhile billy west was
finishing a brief session with the
banker this latter-a roly-poly
little man whose ruddy apple cheeks
and friendly blue eyes contrasted
sharply with the white hair which
sixty years had brought-didnt take
long in telling him that few cattle
were to be bought

  cow folks have been selling stuff
off right fast here lately banker
blaine informed him they had to
-or be stole ragged theres a mys-
terious outlaw operating hereabouts
-smooth as a dogies nose the
phantom

  yes said billy ive heard of
him fact is i saw him

  you did blaine showed instant
interest 

  briefly then billy recounted his
little brush with the outlaw down
at the mexican ranch

  the banker smiled well it is
a fact that the phantom seems to
aid many mexicans but he or
somebody else is certainly biting
into the bigger outfits my banks
crammed full of money theres been
so much hurried selling

  billy got to his feet so theres
nobody yuh can recommend to me
then he asked surely somebody
ought to have good stuff left they
cant all be scared of this phantom
nobody but thain and markly
and you said you couldnt do busi-
ness with the rocking h come to
think of it though thain owns an-
other small outfit you might try
him down at the pay dirt
thanks said billy i will

  he left the little bank and headed
down the street more interested in
seeing plug marklys card-shark
partner than in dealing with such a
type

  like buck billy hadnt forgotten
old pablos story about the suspi-
cions aroused by the disappearance
of hannah the rocking hs former
owner

  he had almost gained the bat-
wing doors of the saloon when a
terrific din broke out inside the
crash of falling chairs and tables
struck harshly on his ears

  then sing los voice rang out in
a squeal of frantic terror billy
went through the doors like a shot
the pay dirt was in an uproar

  sing lo in the savagely cold
grasp of gyp thain was being
shaken like a rat while the little
chink shrieked murder

  for card shark had just met card
shark there at the gambling table
sing lo for all of his bland inno-
cent face had proved anything but
guileless

  long before hed ever become a
ranch cook hed had other training
as assistant to a fourth-rate travel-
ing magician hed learned all the
tricks of the trade including smooth
card handling-

  thain had cheated him of course
and sing lo had cheated back so
slick was he that he had beat the
gambler at his own crooked game

  gyp thains hard eyes hadnt
been quick enough to catch him but
the mans knowledge had no one
could be as lucky as sing lo seemed
to be he knew the chink must be
holding out cards

  lunging across the table the gam-
blers hand had snaked up into the
chinamans loosely flowing black
sleeve out camewfour hidden aces
-and then the bdltle was on

  as billy sprang through the door
thain was choking the little man
until his agonized face was more
green than yellow a knife flashed
in the fellows hand he looked fu-
rious enough to use it
ghost rider of the capitans



  drop it billy yelled whipping
out his gun

  but already something else had
happened so swiftly had things oc-
curred that buck and joe were just
springing into action

  the redhead dug for his gun but
buck didnt even take that time
like a buffalo bull on the charge the
veteran had made for the gambler

  wham bucks horny ball of a
fist took thain under the ear the
hombre staggered a dozen feet yet
he held on to that glittering knife

  his face was no longer expression-
less it was a thing of vicious mur-
der

  back his hand flipped like a
streak buck coming on was a
wide-open target

  men diving out of the way sent
joe scott sprawling others bore
down on billy without even seeing
that waddy

  crash a weapon roared

  a slug sped between the heads of
two leaping hombres and hot air
fanned their cheeks but gyp
thains knife was gone poised to
leave his hand it had suddenly been
shot from out his grasp

  smoking gun at his thigh billy
west stepped forward

  leave thet knife lay yuh rat
he snapped or the next time ill
not be so careful of yuh

  his eyes matched thains for ice
his face was even more deadly

  the gambler shook himself to-
gether his face resumed its mask

  gyp thains profession had
taught him coolness while hate
raged hot within that kind is as
dangerous as a lurking rattlesnake

  just as you say hombre he
rapped at billy west you have
the upper hand if these are your
men take them out of here they
disturb the peace of the pay dirt

  why yuh dirty bum snarled

buck yuh started all this i got
me a good notion ter boot yuh
plumb until the middle o next week
git up sing lo and bust im
dry up rapped billy curtly
he herded his pards out of the door
for he had no taste for saloon brawls
gyp thain called after him in words
that seemed ice-sheeted

 the next time we meet my
friend i intend to be the quicker
there was cold death in the
threat if not exactly in the words
billy west merely shrugged every-
where the circle j went in the capi-
tans they seemed to be making ene-
mies

  well they could take care of
themselves billy reckoned against
these crooked rocking h partners

  his eves went up the street
huh think of the ol harry he
muttered and darned if here he
dont come a-faunchin

  three horsemen had burst down
the trail giving into arriba from up
past the little bank plug markly
rode in the lead plying his horse
with steel

  the others rode just as hard
excitement was plain upon them

  they slid to a halt at the pay
dirt marklys horse face had a pe-
culiar look once again billy west
thought he was acting as the jasper
yelled

  the phantom hes pulled an-
other killin jake steiger what
owns the ransom mine has disap-
peared along with thet big pay roll
he was totin to his miners

  a crowd was already around the
three for townsfolk had been leg-
ging it toward the pay dirt as a re-
sult of the previous uproar

  harsh cries at once went up
somebody yelled

  git a posse

 thets what we come fer
snapped markly everybody out


street  smiths wild west weekly

git guns well take thet phantom
and hang im highern a dozen
eagles

  gyp thain shouldered coolly into
the press

  whats that plug he called to
markly old jake steiger mur-
dered are you sure of it what
makes you think it was the phan-
tom

  the words were the natural ones
of an hombre who didnt get easily
excited yet billy west had the im-
pression they were said almost as if
they had been rehearsed

  plug markly snapped them up
like an actor snatching at a cue al-
most before he heard it

  murdered o course he was
murdered thet old buckboard he
always drives was thar in the road
all red-splotched lots of sign of a
struggle too and the hoss doc
hyar hes ready ter swear thet he
saw the phantom

  markly nodded to the second of
the three riders he was a long
gangling individual with a drink-
reddened nose pale watery eyes
and a general seedy hangdog expres-
sion

  billy sized him up at once the
jasper might have been a horse doc-
tor or veterinary at one time but
he certainly didnt seem so now

  the west wants reliable men
whom it can depend upon for such
work when needed this hombre
was far from that type he looked
more like a drink-wrecked weakling

  and such indeed he was hoss
doc they called him because he
had tried the practice once and
failed whisky had brought him
down a hanger-on at gyp thains
he got bed and board by that gam-
blers favor

  yes yes the fellow gulped i
-i seen the phantom

  yuh did snapped billy west

for he thought the man was lying
if yuh did whats he look like
why-why the hoss doc stam-
mered he-er-thet is i didnt see
him close but i-i saw his white
horse oh yes he gulped it was
the phantom

  billy shot another quick question
did he have that mine owner with
him

  why n-no the gangling jasper
admitted i guess-i reckon-he
tugged at his shirt collar while his
watery eyes rolled from markly to
thain as if in search of guidance-
i mustve seen him just-just be-
fore the murder

  the fellow was getting confused
gyp thain swung coldly on billy

  my young friend the gambler
snapped with icy tone it seems to
me that youre mighty interested in
defending this phantom

  interested billy informed him
in getting at the truth does thet
worry yuh he rapped or not
it does not thain rapped

  for a moment their hard eyes
clashed billy west was a stranger
here already the crowd had begun
to regard him with hostile doubtful
looks

  then tension was broken how-
ever when the third of the news-
bearing riders cried in a voice that
choked

  it dont make no difference who
pulled thet job op jake steiger
was as white an ol dutchman as
ever lived even if he was my boss
weve got ter run this murderer
down and git back thet pay-roll
loot

  the speaker the mine superin-
tendent was an honest-looking jas-
per who was undoubtedly greatly
worked up

  quickly a posse was formed and
went thundering out of town the
circle j rode in their midst despite
ghost rider of the capitans



gyp thains and the crowds hard
looks

  billys keen brain was busy near
him galloped old pablo sanchez
he dropped back to the vaqueros
side with a low remark

  what do yuh think of it pablo
would the phantom pull a job like
thet

  no no the mexican was em-
phatic senor steiger heem honest
old man hees mine give work to
poor folks thees robbair have steal
from them for that was beeg pay
roll-tree months back pay senor
steiger he just raise eet aftaire long
fight wid hard luck

  billy wests eyes narrowed the
raising of such a pay roll could have
been no secret in arriba then he
was highly interested in what the
posse might find when they reached
the scene of the murder or attack

  they found little enough how-
ever the twisting trail to the mine
was rocky here and many riders
seemed to have thrashed about the
spot

  looks to me like a gang jumped
him billy said crisply this aint
the phantoms work

  yeah plug markly sneered
thets what yuh say them tracks
was made by my punchers we was
lookin fer thet phantom cow thief
when we run inter the mine super-
intendent hyar whar the murder
took place

  well all i can say billy rapped
is thet yuh did a mighty fine job
of foggin the sign complete

  in fact so thoroughly had all trail
sign been blotted out that the posse
had no idea which way to turn for
long hours they searched the sec-
tion over without the slightest re-
sult

  it had been close to noon when
they started night found them a
tired worn group they headed

back for town disgruntled and
fagged out

  darkness closed on the scene and
in that darkness three riders watch-
ing their chance dropped well back
behind the rest

  no one seemed to see them go-
markly and thain and the hoss
doc

  one pair of keen gray eyes how-
ever noted their absence at once
hardly had they faded away when
billy west suspicious for hours
now turned back

  silently he too was gone with-
out an opportunity to tell his pards
that he was following the three hom-
bres-and one mighty persistent
hunch

chapter vii

elusive loot

jown under a sheltering cut-
bank three hombres squatted
slightly out of the moonlight their
horses were dark splotchy outlines
a few yards to their rear

  from out of a saddlebag plug
markly had just lifted a canvas
sack

  waal hyar she is gyp he re-
marked his voice a chuckling rasp
forty-eight hundred dollars and
did ol steiger fight i had ter plug
him three times before thet old buz-
zard passed out

  just so he passed gyp thain
grunted callously you got the
body done away with did you and
done away with right

  shore the long-faced rancher
growled the hoss doc seen ter
thet

  beside them the gangling hoss
doc nodded and gulped yes he
-hes fixed the weak-chinned
jasper seemed to shiver i got it
done but i dont like thet-thet
kind o work

like it or not youll do it the


street  smiths wild west weekly

gambler snapped youre in on
this clean up to your neck

  turning thains hard eyes gim-
leted the doc

 now just you get this he
ground out i furnish the brains
plug does the gun work and as long
as theres easy money to be had
youre going to do your stuff do
you think im keeping you up for
nothing you spineless drink-soaked
rat

  no no of course not the un-
easy hombre cried in haste but
gyp you-you aint figgerin on an-
other job right off

  i am this very night banker
blaines old tin safe is just full of 
cash

  the hoss docs pale eyes blinked
he fumbled at his throat

  but-but if we keep on he pro-
tested were liable to be found
out

  plug markly sneered aw buck
up howre they goin ter prove
anything agin us a jasper aint
dead-in the eyes o the law-until
his body is found thets why were
usin yuh-ter make plumb shore
thet it aint

 the hoss doc shuddered again
the others looked at him with con-
tempt

  then gyp thain began outlining
his plans-cold cunning snake-
brained at every step

  to-nights the time he finished
after covering the details every-
bodys riled up about that phantom
theyll blame the job on him well
have em running in circles while we
split us up more loot

  speakin of loot plug markly
growled lets make our divvy on
this hyar pay roll and i wants a
full share too i didnt get quite
half after i bumped off jim han-
nah with the money we give him fer
the rockin h

  youll get just what you de-
serve gyp thains voice was flat
once again his eyes were as hard
and glittering as the diamonds in his
tie thet pay roll is forty-eight
hundred im taking three thou-
sand the hoss doc gets a hun-
dred an you markly can have
the rest

  plug marklys protest was instant
harsh

  why blast yuh he snarled
yuh caint hog me like thet im
doin all the killin i gits half
impulsively his hand had dropped
to his six-gun as his words ripped
out with an oath

  gyp thains own slender fingers
slid up to the back of that frozen-
faced gamblers neck

  youll get six inches of steel
driven through your throat he
snapped with icy deadliness as he
fingered his throwing knife one
more crack out of you and theyll
be looking for another disappearing
owner of the rocking h

  plug marklys small close-set eyes
glared back but slowly he released
his hold upon his gun butt it was
plain to see who was the iron-hard
ruler of this mess of crooks

  dang yuh the rancher growled
sometimes i hate yuh worsen i

does thet phantom he-

  is right here gentlemen to re-
lieve you of that loot the voice
crackled from a dense thicket of un-
dergrowth not thirty feet to their
left

  the stunned three spun with the
words materialized from nowhere
a lithe young form stood there dim
in the faint moonlight a six-gun
in each hand wove slowly across the
group the click of two hammers
was heard as the weapons rode back
to full cock

  draw knife or gun the dim fig- 
ure warned coolly and youll never

live out the move now yuh dirty
cutthroats toss me over that loot
plug markly who held the pay-
roll sack stared with eyes that
nearly popped the phantom was
gliding forward his movements like
those of a shadow

  his feet made no sound in the
sand there were spurs at his boots
but they didnt even tinkle indeed
he seemed like a ghost

  his six-guns however were as real
as they were menacing like his
voice they demanded that pay-roll
loot

  with a gurgling catch in his
throat plug markly tossed over the
well-filled sack

  it fell at the phantoms feet and
a few bundles of greenbacks rolled
out he took little notice however
for his eyes were still on the three
crooks

  thain markly he gritted in
tones even colder than gyps yore
lucky to stand there and live this
loot aint all i want i want all the
deadwood on yuh some day ill
get it yuh hounds-proof of these
murders and when i do look out
thains eyes were narrowed slits
the hoss doc shook in his tracks
from plug markly therebhad welled
an explosive gasp

  but it was a gasp of relief by
his own cold words the phantom
had shown that he hadnt bobbed up
here in time to overhear plugs
claims that he himself did all the
killing for the bunch

  not one of the trio moved save
for the shaking knees of the doc

  now ordered the phantom
turn around then lift your guns
-by two fingers only-and flip em
high up thet bank

the hombres started to obey but
as they did so from up the bank a
loose stone came bouncing down it
sounded loud in the darkness it
ww-d

struck upon a boulder with a start-
ling rattle and crash

  some one was coming some one
was near the phantom moved like
a flash

  bending he swept up the sack
shoved the spilled cash bundles in
and whirled back toward the brush
a swish of twigs and he was gone
quickly into the night

  but gyp thain had heard that
swish knew that the phantom had
ducked

  the gambler chanced a swift turn
the thud of horses hoofs broke
from the undergrowth

  brighter because of contrast with
the thicket a patch of moonlight lay
beyond a rider went streaking
across it upon that white horse
ghost

  stop im with lead

  thain raised a furious cry the
gambler carried a gun as well as that
snaky knife

  his  leaped forth and plug
icarklys was also out

  red slashes lanced the night the
white horse stumbled floundered
went down with a jarring smash

  the rider rolled from the leather
still hanging to the sack with a
snort the cayuse surged back upon
its feet

  the phantom caught the saddle
in a desperate lunging leap ap-
parently unhurt he hipped about to
fire as more lead whipped the moon-
lit patch

  the next instant he was reeling
from horn to cantle and back elu-
sive though hed always been a slug
had found its mark

  then the swaying figures own
gun flamed in a leaden burst the
ringing shot sang wild the phan-
tom was sagging badly no longer
bullet proof

  we drilled him he cant last
long thains voice was a savage


street  smiths wild west weekly

snarl after him quick you fools
hes still got that pay-roll cash

 indeed the phantom had the
sack a vague blotch in one hand
rode with him through the night

chapter viii

a clever ruse

jphain markly and the hoss doc
piled into saddle leather and
went fogging in pursuit the drum-
ming of their horses drowned out
the sound of running feet a waddy
racing along the cut bank had ar-
rived a moment too late

 that waddy was billy west
warily he had followed the three
crooks for nearly an hour then a
tangle of slide rock theyd crossed
had made him drop behind

  he had had to circle around for
dangers steel-shod hoofs would
have warned them if he had pushed
straight on through the rock con-
sequently he lost them a short time
before they halted beneath the shel-
tering bank

  but his sense of direction was
keen and his ears a pair of the best
when he heard no faintest sound
of horses he knew that they had
stopped

  dismounting himself hed ranged
cautiously back and forth a mum-
ble of voice had reached him thrown
back by the high cut bank silently
he stole toward them having gained
its top

  but he was still some distance
away when the phantoms dim fig-
ure stepped forth hurriedly he
sped forward for the mysterious
hombres sharp words let him know
what was taking place

  the phantom might be all right
but billy wanted to catch those
three buzzards with the loot then
his foot had struck a stone the
phantom had leaped to his horse

  too late billy was on the scene
all that awaited him was the sound
of fierce pursuit

  dang he muttered if thet
aint tough luck know who pulled
thet robbery beyond the slightest
doubt but i cant prove it on em
it would just be their word against
mine in court

  turning he went legging it back
for the spot where he had left his
own fleet cayuse

 that the phantom was badly
wounded he realized the daring
young hombre might drop helpless
at any minute be killed by the sav-
age crooks

  whoever he is billy muttered
he certainly needs my help against
thet crooked pack and i need him
to back up my story im throwin
in with the phantom but hell
have to give a darned good explana-
tion about why hes grabbed off the
cash

  the circle j owner had reached
danger now he took the saddle in
a leap

  back to the cut bank he tore
save for dangers own hoof thuds
silence gripped the scene no
sounds reached him of the chase

  he was about to fog on regardless
when from back the way he had
come a series of furious crashings
broke out

  his gun jumped into his hand
had the phantom and his pursuers
doubled swiftly back

  two riders burst into view fol-
lowed by a third from the way
they sat their mounts he recognized
them at once	v

  joe sing lo he cried howd
yuh ever get here whos thet be-
hind yuh buck

  yep the redhead responded
pulling to a halt we missed yuh
nearly an hour ago and turned right
back we figgered somethin had
ghost rider of the capitans



happened then we heard all thet
shootin and headed this way hot-
foot

  im glad yuhve come said
billy weve got some real work
ahead of us

  by this time buck foster had
forged up to the group the vet-
erans hat was gone a trickle ran
down one cheek his  was out

 whats come off hyar he
howled when he saw billy west
did yuh ketch them skunks with
the goods boss whar am the var-
mints

  quickly billy acquainted his pards
with the nights events buck fos-
ter cried at once

  the phantom huh by heifers
i knowed it fer a fact thet danged
son jist throwed me on me face
what billy exclaimed yuh
saw him did yuh where

  naw i didnt see him buck
growled but hes been killin
steers agin my hoss fell over one
back thar a ways and derned near
killed me blamed if i aint gittin
sick o thet hant leavin critters lay
around ter break an hombres neck
is thet what threw yuh said
joe i thought yuhd jist fell off
aw go soak yore head the
lanky cowpoke snorted yuh
knows danged well i kin ride any-
thin what wears hair on its back
cut out the funny stuff billy
snapped weve got no time to
waste the moonlights gettin some
stronger now well have to track
thet chase

  they rode around the thicket and
out into the moonlit patch buck
foster gave a squawk

  help me hannah somebodys
been killed he was jabbing his
six-gun excitedly forward at a dark
blotch now plain on the ground
the phantom must a drilled one
o them thar skunks

  why thet couldnt be cried
billy i saw them all ride off
but there the form was not far
from the thicket it looked like a
man his hat still on his head curled
up in a knot

  the young boss of circle j swung
down and hurried to the spot he
bent he fingered the object then
straightened with a grim apprecia-
tive little laugh

  boys he said this explains
part of the phantom mystery
heres what that slick young hom-
bre used to make folks think he was
bullet-proof

  the others tumbled from their
horses without the slightest effort
billy had picked up the dark form

  a stiff dry cowskin he said
cut in the form of a puncher even
to the hat theres a pair of light
wooden crosspieces he had it
stretched on all he had to do was
hold it above the saddle while he
swung down low behind his hoss
and blazed away across the fork
waal ill be a horned toad
buck foster exclaimed thets
why hes been killin steers then
why-why thet phantom must be
a man dern it-the veteran tried
to look disappointed-i wanted ter
throw in with a hant

  hes slicker than any ghost yuhll
ever see billy west said quietly
no wonder the rockin h punchers
thought they hit him time and
again dust would spurt from this
dirty old cowhide even in the moon-
light

  going to danger he strapped the
light dummy along a saddle skirt
it was easy for him to understand
many things now including why the
phantom had at last been hit

  when the fellows horse had
fallen the phantom had lost his
cowskin in his tumble to the dirt
needing a hand free to grab the


street  smiths wild west weekly

saddle horn hed had to leave be-
hind either the dummy or the pay-
roll sack

  daringly he had chosen to risk
that hail of bullets rather than drop
the cash the fellow had nerve all
right

 probably figured them three
skunks would be after him so hard
theyd never see the dummy billy
said after quickly pointing this out
mebbe hell come back for it later
if he gets away-which last aint
certain by a long shot

  again the circle j boss swung up
on his horse buck foster threw in
with a snort

 heck he wont come back
thars too many dead steers around
he kin git him a hide whenever he
wants it hes a smart hombre

  billy west didnt reply instead
he instructed joe scott to pick up
the trail of the chase and follow it
the redhead a keen hand at reading
sign could be depended upon to con-
sume far less time than most here
in the cut-up turf the tracks were
plain in the moonlight

  with joe leading the way the
circle j pards pressed on for a
time the phantom and his pursuers
had held to a fairly straight course

 then the wounded young rider
had doubled and the crooks seemed
to have been thrown off

  their tracks circled here and
there plainly confusion had them
once again the phantom had es-
caped

  all this joes keen eyes read in
the strong flood of white moonlight
trailing the phantom however
wasnt anything like so easy the
redhead had to work back to where
that elusive hombre had first thrown
the others off the scent

  consequently much time was lost
the moon was low in the west when
at last he felt positive that he had

found the spot faint hoofprints
showed on harder ground where
brush hid an arroyo mouth

  darkness was shutting down fast
again the pards hadnt made a
mile before they had to stop

  well shove on first thing in the
mornin billy said i mean to
find out just what he intends to do
with ol jake steigers loot

  sing lo built a hurried fire and
produced some articles of food he
always carried in his saddle pockets
the meal was quickly eaten the
pards lay down to rest

  up with the dawn they were on
the way hoof tracks showed clear
again on a twisting circling route
well back into the hills these led
crossed ridges dipped into draws
and rimmed down into a canyon

  pinon was thick in here so thick
indeed that the circle j were almost
upon a mexican jacal before they
were aware of the fact a drab yet
sturdy brown dobe the hut blended
into the canyons side with colors
that almost matched

  no smoke came from its low chim-
ney the windows were dull in the
morning light yet the nose of a
white horse showed over the brush
corral behind the circle j had
tracked down the elusive phantom
at last

chapter ix

buzzard bait

clipping down silently from
their horses the circle j crept
up on the hut from inside the mur-
mur of voices reached them but no
words were distinct

  now billy whispered tensely
shoulder to shoulder the waddies
hit the door with a crash

  inside they tumbled billy in
front as the door swept back a
cry rang out in spanish beside a
bunk in the far corner a woman
ghost rider of the capitans



had wheeled to face them-a middle-
aged startled mexican

  frantically she jerked out her
skirts extending them wide as if
to conceal some one on the bunk
but the form there-bandaged of
head and shoulders-had moved to
protect itself

  a bronzed hand shot out from the
blankets to an old rawhide-bottomed
chair that held a colt the weapon
leaped up in those fingers its ham-
mer going back

  but quick as the phantom was he
failed to match speed with billy
west billys gun was out in a blur
his clear young voice cracked

  dont try it phantom were
four to one yuh havent got a
chance

  the wounded young hombre saw
that he hadnt but even at that
billy could tell from his gritty look
that he was minded to shoot

  the jaspers strong mouth was a
straight tense line his clamped
jaw was ridged with tiny muscles
his fine pair of gray eyes flashed

  all we want billy said quickly
is an explanation from you-and
that pay-roll loot

  well youll never get it the
phantom shot back who are you
-another passell of crooks

  hardly billy laughed and i
dont think you are either when
it comes right down to cases i
know you didnt kill ol jake steiger
thet was markly thain or the
hoss doc

  the phantom nodded his band-
aged head yes the dirty curs
but i cant prove it on em who
are you anyhow and what do you
want with the pay-roll loot

  to take it back where it be-
longs billy answered the last ques-
tion first

  the phantom lowered his gun
his lips lost their tense fierce look

  well youre late friend he re-
plied with a cool little chuckle now
its already been sent back este-
van my good mexican host here
left with it before daylight to slip
it back into the mine office the
phantom is no thief

  si si that ees r-right the
woman cried estevan my hus-
band he do just that

  waal ill be a horned toad
buck mumbled what does yer
know about thet

  im not surprised said billy
because he informed the phan-
tom i saw you hold up them
skunks

  briefly then he told who the circle
j were and why they were horning
in the phantom could see from
their manner that they had no use
for crooks slowly his face relaxed

  furthermore said billy we
found thet cowhide of yores thet
was a clever stunt so you dont
fool us hombre just what is be-
hind your work

  the phantoms tanned face grew
grim once more

  murder-jest plain murder he
rapped a killin pulled by those
crooks you jaspers are strangers
here and you stack up like square-
shooters to me i am the son of
jim hannah and regardless of what
folks think i own the rockin h
in short choppy sentences then
he went on with his account some-
thing of a saddle drifter hed been
away from home for years then
hed found a good ranch location up
in colorado just a few weeks back

  i wrote dad about it young
bud said hed always liked thet
state so we decided to team up
together if he could get a price for
the rockin h

  well he got it from thain and
markly and wrote me he was pullin
out next day with the cash when


street  smiths wild west weekly

he failed to show up i got suspi-
cious dropped down to investi-
gate

 knowing markly and thain by
reputation hed chosen to arrive at
night the first person hed met
was estevan mendoza the mexican
who owned this hut estevan an
old friend gave him the lay of
things for already lincoln county
had begun to suspect

  i went to night ridin said bud
around the old home ranch dad
had to be hidden or buried some-
where but i couldnt get the proof
marklys men shot at me so i rigged
up thet cowhide stunt

  a cool faint smile creased his
face thet give me the phantom
name i let it ride it helped
sod the billy the kid stuff thet
the mexicans thought when i drove
back their stolen stuff and thets
just how she stands west i still
have no proof

  by heifers well git it fer yuh
buck cried the veteran cracked
one horny hand loudly into the
other his fierce old brown eyes
flashed

  well do our best said billy
quietly how badly are yuh shot
up

  not bad a clean hole through
my shoulder thet senora mendoza
has patched up its my left one
i can still use a gun my head
cracked a rock i could ride now
if i had to im just restin up

  well keep on restin billy
urged well scout around and

  the rest of the circle js own
words were torn to tatters by the
furious drum of a horses hoofs
the phantoms face went hard he
whipped up his gun while his tight
voice hissed

  stand aside if thets somebody
else whats followed me-

  but the hurrying rider soon
proved to be estevan the mexican

  rather excitedly he burst in his
tongue rattling with fresh news he
had to tell he broke off at once
however when he saw the strange
waddies there

  quickly reassured by the phan-
tom estevan launched forth at
once

  the bank at arriba she have
been rob i learn eet at the mine
senor blaine he ees believe to have
been keeled they fin dark stains
around the safe

  hes disappeared too then has
he the words ripped from billy
west

  si senor the bankair ees gone
eet ees a job complete

  phantom billy declared its
easy to see thet all these things tie
up wer ridin to town at once
if joe scott finds thet trail by day-
light hell follow it to the end yuh
can count on thet

  billy and his pards hurried from
the house

  young bud the phantom yelled
for them to wait but already they
were swinging aboard their mounts
off they tore down the canyon to
get to the scene of the crime as
quickly as possible and ferret out the
bandit tracks

  they hadnt gone far however
before the thunder of hoofs behind
caused them to look back the
phantom was spurring to overtake
them on his white horse ghost

  im in on this he declared
grimly when they had waited for
him to sweep up

  but you oughtnt to reveal yore
identity billy said until weve got
the proof

  thets all right ill wait a little
ways out of arriba until yuh wad-
dies get on the scene tken ill join
you those crooksll fight like
ghost rider of the capitans



 fiends wounded or not i can still
 shoot straight

    the little party sped on hidden
 by ridges and folds arriba lay miles
 below it must have been ten
 oclock before they came near the
 place

    with the town still about a mile
 away the phantom drew to a halt
 ill wait here he announced in
 some good lookout place

    his eyes ranged around the local-
 ity so did those of billy west

brushy draws came angling down
above a deep ravine something
floated on motionless wings then
spiraled banked and dipped from
- sight

   that something was a buzzard
 billys eyes shot up two more of
 the birds were sailing near high
 in the heavens above he made out
 other dark specks

   huh he said somethin dead
 down there he rode to the steep
 banks lip

   heck jist another one o them
 dead steers buck foster grunted
 as the veterans eyes peered down
 through the heavy brush i can
 see its head say phantom did yuh
 kill thet un too what the heck
 am the idea didnt yuh have skins
 enough

   ive killed no critters said
 young bud hannah until i lost
 it one hide was enough

    thet steer hasnt been skinned
 billy west announced neither
 had those others here yuh jas-
 pers wait here i got a hunch
 despite his words however it
 was something more than a mere
 hunch which caused billy to slide
 from danger and hurry down the
 bank his agile mind was doing
 some keen straight thinking about
 those dead steers before he reached
 the bottom the heavy undergrowth
 hid him from sight

   he was gone a good ten minutes
when he came scrambling back
again his firm-jawed face was set
his gray eyes were hard and grim
yet they held a triumphant light

   he held something clutched in one
 hand

   the end of the trail he said
weve got the deadwood now
pinned tight on those snake-brained
ci ooks

chapter x

   the tale the buzzards told

lng hours later it was when a
grimly waiting little group of
riders made out a trail-worn posse
winding back from the capitans

   billy his pards and the phantom
 watched the slow approach of the
 weary disgruntled searchers the
 posse was returning empty-handed
 after a full days scouring of the
 country for the bank robbers they
 couldnt catch

   all right estevan billy called
 over his shoulder

   from the mouth of a draw a high-
 wheeled wagon came creaking slowly
 forth

   coolly the little bunch turned
their horses up slope to intercept the
posse plug markly thain and the
hoss doc theyd learned down in
arriba had ridden with the posse

   ill start the ball rollin said
 billy crisply the rest sit tight
 and watch

   hands near their holstered six-
guns they met the posses advance
a town marshal rode in the lead be-
side him the three prime crooks

   ive got good news for yuh mar-
  shal billys cool tones announced
 good news and bad thet is yore
 hunt is over-them dirty killers are

   what whar the officer cried
yuh mean-

right here beside you billys


street  smiths wild west weekly

words crackled like ice thain
plug markly the hoss doc

  the three stared at him in amaze-
ment the rest of the posse did like-
wise then gyp thains cold voice
snapped

  youre makin fool statements
hombre i take it your brain is
cracked the gamblers dark face
was expressionless yet every muscle
had tensed

  take it as yuh please rapped
billy but the laws takin yuh
gyp thain yuh and markly have
made off with your last man back
there comes the proof

  a jerk of hisleft thumb across his
shoulder pointed to estevans creak-
ing wagon the hoss doc began to
shake

 why-why- that gangling

drink-wrecked hombre stammered

do yuh-er-er- say yuh

cant have- why i-

  shut up you fool gyp thain
snarled at the trembling weakling
then he whirled back to billy with
a hiss what dyou mean proof
the fellows slender fingers were
snapping up to the back of his neck

  the bodies of yore victims
billy flung in his teeth banker
blaine jake steiger and ol jim
hannah what owned the rockin
h we found em this mornin
sewed up in steers a neat job done
by yore hoss doc

  that gangling jasper gave a low
moan plug markly his face a sud-
den dirty white snarled like a trap-
caught wolf but brazenly gyp
thain tried to carry his bluff to the
last

  well what of it he snapped
good work if youve got em but
that pins nothing on me you may
have killed them yourself

  the deadwood is pinned all
right like the cut of a lash
billys next sentence whipped out

gyp thain wheres yore tie pin
thets done the pinnin stuff

  with a violent start the fellows
hand leaped to his tie no diamond-
set ornament met his fingers billys
chill words followed up

  banker blaine died of a knife
wound the other two were shot
blaine went down fightin with his
killer in his struggles his hands
closed on somethin-somethin thet
pierced his palm and stuck

  billys hand flipped open a dia-
mond horseshoe pin that every one
knew flashed and gleamed in the
suns declining light

  here thet somethin is for honest

men to look at yuh dirty-

 but gyp thain knew that he
could bluff no longer his hand
whipped from his pinless tie to the
sheathed knife at his neck

 yes and yuh die too he
howled the blade out like rattlers
fangs whipped straight for billys
heart

  billy had expected this yet the
gamblers movement was so rippling
that the young boss of circle j had
no time to draw and shoot

  the knife was almost on him be-
fore a desperate twirl of his body
threw him by the scantest of inches
out of its deadly path

  the blade flashed harmlessly on
the posse was in an uproar plug
markly had jerked a gun

 bullets flamed and screamed
with a furious oath gyp thain like-
wise had his gun out

  the muzzle swerved on billy it
was his life or thains billy let the
hombre have it the gambler died
in his stirrups a bullet straight
through his heart

  a rider broke from the melee
plug markly was in full flight

  no yuh dont yuh murderin
ranch-stealin hound the phan-
toms voice rang out yore stayin
ghost rider of the capitans



here to hang for yore black-hearted
work

  the spurs of the wounded youth
streaked back young bud hannah
son of old jim was on the speeding
rancher inside of two long streaking
jumps

  markly whirled gun raised

 crash-crash-h two weapons
blared and thundered a rider spun
to earth

  but it wasnt the elusive phantom
grimly justice done he came riding
back

  howls rose from another jasper
howls of weak-kneed fear and fright
joe scott had nabbed the hoss doc
furiously buck foster thrust his old
 into the hombres face

  dang yuh the veteran roared
pull a gun-pull a gun yuh pole-

cat i wants ter shoot yore lights

  dont worry about him said
billy lincoln county will see to
it thet he gets his just deserts

  quienl sabe

horses for cuba

  at the close of the spanish-
american war there were very few
cattle in cuba and cattlemen from
the southwest began exporting their
live stock to that island

  sometimes the cargo was sold be-
fore it was shipped but more often
it was landed at some port on the
island and sold in small lots from
the corrals or along the road as the
herd was driven inland

  one day a number of them were
watching a cargo of horses that had
just been unloaded and were being
sold out from the corrals there
were two big american negroes in
charge one caught the horses and
held one by the nose and ears while
the other saddled it and got on

  the instant the horse was turned
loose it would go pitching off across
the corral doing all its tricks while
the negro sat it fast and fanned it
the cubans had never seen any-

thing of the sort before and they
asked if the negroes were not alo
wild like the horses

  a good many outlaw horses were
shipped over some with a record of
having killed one or two men the
cubans would take hold of a horses
tail and give it a jerk when they
were considering buying it

  when one of them would walk up
to a notoriously bad horse and
catch hold of its tail every one who
knew the animal would expect it to
kick the cuban into the next world
instantly but instead of doing
that the horse would surprise the
americans by humping up and
cringing so that the buyer never
knew what he had missed

  how the outlaw horses behaved
or what mischief they did after they
became the property of their new
owners the americans never
learned
gold
from thunderbolt

       a jim hazel forest ranger story

      by lee harrington

          author of the cabin on gunsight lake etc

crouched among the rocks
of the mountain side black
carver and his partner sam
gorrity watched the snow-covered
road which led from the old mining
camp of thunderbolt to the state
capital two six-guns were hol-
stered at each mans hips and in
front of each a rifle leaned against
a rock

  no killing mind yuh gorrity
growled black caryer suddenly
the mail driver his dogs sled and
the gold we heard is to be shipped
from thunderbolt to the state cap-
ital to-day have jest got to vanish
into thin air this is goin to be

one robbery thatll make history in
the thunder bird range

  he reached for his rifle as the
sound of distant sleigh bells drifted
through the snowstorm that was
sweeping the mountains a few
minutes later the desperadoes heard
a mans voice urging a dog team to
greater speed crouched behind
their rocks the bandits waited un-
til the team was almost abreast of
them then rifles to their shoulders
they stepped into the road

  taken by surprise the lead dog
stopped so suddenly that the other
animals almost piled on top of it a
man running behind the sled spat
gold from thunderbolt



out a bitter oath and raised his mit-
ten ed hands above his head as the
curt command shot from black car-
vers bearded lips

  stick em up we want that
gold

  black carver kept the mail driver
covered with his rifle gorrity
stepped forward and jerked a six-
gun from the victims holster then
with a length of cord he had
brought with him for the purpose
the desperado bound the mail
drivers wrists and hitched him to
the end of the sled

  how much gold dust yuh got
aboard growled black carver

  find out for yoreself yuh low-
down thieving coyote snapped
snowbird williams the walrus-
mustached mail driver i aint
agoin to tell yuh nothin

  sam gorrity brought the flat of
his hand across the drivers cheek
and sent him staggering

 how much gold yuh got
aboard he snarled quick now
or ill smash yuh good

  fifty thousand dollars worth of
dust replied snowbird but you
fellers are crazy if yuh think yuh
can get it out of the hills

  shut up barked gorrity we
aint askin yuh for advice all yuh
got to do is to follow the sled and
keep yore mouth shut

  with gorrity at the gee-pole and
the mail driver hitched to the back
of the sled the dog team turned off
the road behind strode black
carver carrying his rifle in the crook
of his arm

  all that day it snowed heavily
by night there was no sign left to
show that the sled had turned out
of the road it vanished from the
sight and knowledge of men

  two days later as jim hazel
forest ranger was working over a

report in the thunder river ranger
station the door was pushed open
and a tall broad-shouldered man
strode into the cabin he was
garbed in a fringed buckskin shirt
ornamented with dyed porcupine
quills a six-gun was holstered at
his hip and in the crook of his left
arm he carried a winchester rifle

  hello bill greeted jim hazel
as he turned in his chair and recog-
nized his visitor whats on your
mind

  bill tigors lips parted in a grin
beneath his drooping black mus-
tache but his black eyes gleamed
fiercely above his hooked nose
drawing a plug of tobacco from his
pocket he tore off a chew and spat
out of the open door

  hello jimmy drawled the
mountaineer heard the latest

  not a thing bill replied jim
hazel the telephone line is out
of order probably a tree fell across
the wire during the storm im go-
ing to look into the trouble as soon
as i get this report finished

  bill tigor settled his lean length
in a chair and gazed out of the open
door at the storm that was sweeping
thunder river canyon

  jimmy he drawled snowbird
williams left thunderbolt two days
ago with fifty thousand dollars
worth of gold on his sled he aint
been heard of since

  got lost in the storm probably
said jim hazel hell show up in
a few days

  sure it would be like snowbird
williams to get lost snorted bill
tigor him that was born and
brung up in the thunder bird
mountains and lived in em forty
years yuhve got another guess
cornin jimmy as the hawk re-
marked when the chicken mistook
him for a pheasant


street  smiths wild west weekly

  well whats the answer asked
jim hazel a man eight dogs a
sled and fifty thousand dollars
worth of gold dont disappear into
thin air

  snowbird might have stole the
gold said bill tigor figurin that
the storm would cover his tracks
jim hazel rose to his feet and
slipped on his mackinaw

  lets go repair the telephone
line said the ranger so that we
can find out from the sheriffs office
whether any trace has been found
of snowbird williams and the gold
jim hazel and bill tigor repaired
the telephone line and called up the
sheriffs office only to learn that
searchers had been unable to find
the slightest trace of the vanished
outfit

  the storm covered every track
and trail said the sheriff looks
as if the thief has made his get-
away this will sure make history
in the thunder bird range

  jim hazel promised to keep a
sharp lookout for sled tracks while
he was patrolling the forest then
he hung up the receiver and turned
to bill tigor

  watch out for tracks around
gunsight lake when you get back
to your cabin said the ranger ill
be passing through that section in a
few days ill call at your cabin to
see if you have any news

ii

  during the days that followed
the thought of the vanished gold
was never out of the forest rangers
mind as he made his lonely patrols
through the snow-covered moun-
tains but though the storm had
ceased and the sky was bright and
cloudless jim hazel found not a
single human footprint in the snow
he drove his dog team up to the

tigor boys cabin one evening just
as the sun was sinking behind the
white peaks which ringed the shores
of gunsight lake the three tigor
boys stepped out of the cabin as
jim hazel stopped his dogs

  hello jimmy drawled bill
find out anything about that van-
ished gold

 curt and young gabe tigor
greeted the ranger then they began
to unhitch the dogs jim hazel fol-
lowed bill into the cabin

  i must admit that the robbery
-if it was a robbery-has got me
licked said jim hazel you fel-
lows got any news

  bill tigor set a coffeepot on the
stove and began to saw some steaks
off a shoulder of frozen venison
which he had taken from the dingle
outside the cabin

  i dont know as yuhd call it
news jimmy drawled the moun-
taineer but while we was away
tendin to our trap lines somebody
chopped a hole in the ice of gun-
sight lake we couldnt help but
see it when we was crossing the
lake with our dog team for the
water had bubbled up out of the
hole and spread over the snow

  bill tigor turned to the stove and
tossed his venison steaks into a fry-
ing pan paying no more attention
to jim hazel who had dropped into
a chair

  suddenly the mountaineer shot a
glance at the ranger

  who do yuh suppose done it
jimmy he drawled

 who did what asked jim
hazel who was drowsy after his
hard trip

  who chopped that thar hole in
the ice said bill tigor

  jim hazel licked his lips as he
sniffed the odor of coffee and frying
venison he was more interested
in putting a good meal under his
gold from thunderbolt



belt than he was in answering rid-
dles

  how do you suppose i should
know he asked who do you
suppose did it

  me drawled bill tigor well
jimmy i aint no detective as the
preacher explained to the bootleg-
ger but it seems like the feller who
chopped the hole in the ice might
have been the same man who got
away with fifty thousand dollars
worth of gold

  suddenly wide awake jim hazel
sprang to his feet

  dumb is what i am exclaimed
the ranger in disgust just plain
dumb

  no yuh aint dumb jimmy
said bill tigor yore jest hungry
thats all as the blue jay remarked
when the fox stepped into a trap

  all that evening jim hazel and
the tigor boys talked about the
vanished gold wondering how they
might discover who had visited
gunsight lake but although they
searched the woods for miles the
next day they found only the tracks
and trails left by wild animals
that evening they returned to the
cabin worn out and completely puz-
zled

  at sunrise jim hazel stepped
outside the cabin to get a breath
of fresh air before breakfast after
a moment he raised his field glasses
to his eyes and swept the hills his
shout brought the tigor boys to his
side

 take a look through these
glasses bill said the ranger is
that a wreath of fog rising above the
trees on the other side of the lake
or is it smoke

  bill tigor adjusted the field
glasses to suit his vision for a
long moment he stood looking
through them then he handed them
back to jim hazel

  if that aint smoke then im kin
to a coyote jimmy drawled the
mountaineer i guess yuhve
found the trail of the vanished
gold

  an hour later jim hazel was
striding alone through the white
woods

  believing that he could cover
rough country faster without his
dogs the ranger had left them with
the tigor boys and he had refused
to allow the mountaineers to go
with him

  youve got your trap lines to at-
tend to boys said jim hazel and
after all i may be on a false scent
perhaps that smoke is coming from
the cabin of a trapper who knows
nothing about the stolen gold

 hour after hour jim hazel
strode along on his sixty-inch-web
snowshoes and gradually the coun-
try grew rougher by noon he
found himself traveling through a
maze of rocky canyons the sides
were so steep that the ranger ex-
pected a snowslide might start at
any moment and bury him but sun-
set found him safely out of the can-
yons

  standing on the summit of a
bleak ridge jim hazel gazed across
no mans canyon at a cluster of
snow-covered buildings which clung
to the side of arrowhead mountain

  the golden age mine said the
ranger aloud according to what
ive heard it used to be one of the
richest mines in the thunder bird
mountains

  smoke was rising from the stove-
pipe of a cabin in the bottom of the
canyon as jim hazel stood watch-
ing it dogs began to bark some-
where

  jim hazeps lips set in a firm line
as he listened and his blue eyes
grew hard and cold for he be-
lieved he had discovered the hiding


street  smiths wild west weekly

place of the bandits who had stolen
the gold yet though jim hazel
fully realized that he might encoun-
ter desperate men who would try to
kill him it did not occur to the
young ranger to seek the assistance
of the tigor boys

  slowly jim hazel descended the
ridge into the canyon barking
savagely the dogs caught his scent
and rushed to attack the ranger as
he strode toward the cabin

  well ill be darned exclaimed
jim hazel those arent the dogs
that belonged to snowbird wil-
liams for the ranger knew the
mail drivers dogs by sight almost
as well as he knew his own

  the words had hardly left jim
hazels lips when the door of the
cabin opened and black carver and
sam gorrity stood framed against a
background of light their right
hands dropped to the six-guns hol-
stered at their hips

 evening boys my name is
hazel

  black carver spoke to the dogs
and they slunk away into the shad-
ows jim hazel took a step for-
ward but stopped when he found
himself looking into the muzzles of
two six-guns

  what do yuh want growled
black carver

  how about staying overnight
with you boys asked jim hazel
i am the ranger from thunder
river and im on patrol

  jim hazel saw no reason just
then to mention the vanished gold
for experience had taught him that
a man often learns more by keeping
his business to himself

  confident that they were not sus-
pected carver and gorrity hol-
stered their weapons and became
more friendly mentioning their
names they told the ranger he was
welcome to stay overnight

  stepping inside the cabin jim
hazel leaned his rifle in a corner he
shed his mackinaw and hung his
belt with its holstered six-gun over
the end of a bunk then he sank
wearily onto a stool

  hard country youve located in
remarked the ranger ive been all
day getting here from gunsight
lake

  meet any one on the trail
ranger asked black carver while
his partner was busy getting sup-
per

  jim hazel crossed his knees and
leaned back against the side of a
bunk

  only the tigor boys he replied
i stopped a couple of nights with
them at their trapping cabin at
gunsight lake

  a quick glance passed between
the desperadoes at mention of the
lake but jim hazel pretended not
to see it

  we was over to the lake a while
back to get fish for our dogs said
gorrity after a moment but we
didnt see no cabin them trappers
find out wed been there

  the tigor boys didnt mention
having seen any one replied jim
hazel theyll sure be glad to
know there are other trappers in the
country

 black carver motioned jim
hazel to the table seated between
the two desperadoes the ranger en-
joyed his supper letting his hosts do
most of the talking

  we aint trappers explained
black carver fact is we are
workin the old golden age mine
we used to work in the camp years
ago when she wras boomin

  having any luck asked jim
hazel this is my first visit to the
mine but i understood that it was
worked out years ago

 i reckon two men who know
gold from thunderbolt



minin can still make wages here
growled black carver then as an
idea occurred to him he glanced
curiously at jim hazel passin
around this way often ranger he
asked

  i usually patrol each section of
my district once a month replied
jim hazel why

  spose yuh could take a little
gold dust to the bank for us once
a month asked carver yuh
bein a ranger we could trust yuh
with the gold

  sure glad to oblige you boys
said jim hazel got much dust on
hand

  sam gorrity put some food on a
plate and rose to his feet

  guess ill feed this to the dogs
he muttered they need all they
can get to eat

  as the cabin door closed behind
gorrity his partner left the table
and followed him out of the cabin

  ill be back in a few minutes
ranger he said make yoreself to
home

iii

  plowing his way over a beaten
trail in the snow black carver
reached the mouth of the tunnel
which led into the golden age
mine stopping to light a candle
which he took from a niche in a
wall the desperado entered the tun-
nel he found gorrity waiting for
him in a station which had been
hewn out of the solid rock

  are yuh crazy carver was
gorritys greeting what do yuh
mean by askin that ranger to take
the gold to the bank for us

  not all at once pardner said
carver soothingly jest a hundred
ounces or so at a time every one
in thunderbolt will believe the
ranger when he says the gold came
from this mine by spring all the

gold will be safely in the bank in
our names	

  gorrity slapped his hand down on
his thigh with a report like a pistol
shot

  yuhve sure got brains carver
he roared id never in the world
have thought of sending the gold to
the bank by a forest ranger

  half an hour later the desper-
adoes returned to the cabin to find
jim hazel dozing on his stool
shaking the ranger into wakefulness
black carver showed him a small
buckskin sack nearly filled with
gold the desperadoes had been
wise enough to use their own con-
tainers for the gold and there was
no mark on the sack which might
have proved that the gold was
stolen

  last months clean-up ranger
explained black carver every
month well want yuh to take out
about the same number of ounces
if the luck holds the way it has been
doin

  i hope your luck holds said jim
hazel now if you boys dont
mind id like to turn in im so
sleepy that i can hardly keep my
eyes open

 go ahead ranger growled
black carver with a wink to his
partner it sure was a lucky thing
for us when yore patrol brought
yuh this way

  jim hazel was far from sleepy as
he lay in his bunk for he was al-
most certain that he was the guest
of the very bandits who had stolen
the gold

  it had occurred to jim hazel
when sam gorrity had placed a
steak and bread on a plate and an-
nounced that he was going to give
the food to the dogs that snowbird
williams was imprisoned in the old
mine for it seemed more likely to
the ranger that if the food had been


street  smiths wild west weekly

intended for the animals gorrity
would simply have tossed it into the
snow jim hazels suspicions had
been strengthened when black car-
ver had followed his partner out of
the cabin and returned a half hour
later with the poke of gold

  yet the ranger knew that to have
shown the slightest doubt of the des-
peradoes story might have resulted
in his own death so hour after
hour he lay planning on how to out-
wit the men whom he suspected of
stealing the gold

  well look for yuh back about a
month from now ranger said
black carver next morning by
that time we hope to have another
hundred ounces of dust ready to
send to the bank

  jim hazel strode down no mans
canyon for five miles then he
left the canyon and concealed him-
self among the timber on the moun-
tainside all the rest of that day
the ranger watched the trail think-
ing that the men he suspected might
have become suspicious and followed
him

  when dusk settled down on the
mountains jim hazel rose beside
his fire there was a grim look on
his lean features as he climbed a
ridge which ran the same way as
the canyon by the time a full
moon was shedding its silver light
over the mountains the forest
ranger once more was looking down
at the buildings of the golden age
mine

  a light was shining through the
window of the desperadoes cabin
after watching it a few minutes
jim hazel began to descend the
ridge expecting every moment that
the dogs would bark and warn the
suspected men that somebody was
around

  but when at last jim hazel
reached the bottom of the canyon

the dogs ran to meet him with wag-
ging tails having once formed his
acquaintance the brutes seemed to
think that he had a perfect right to
be there

  keeping his hand on the butt of
his holstered six-gun jim hazel
stole toward the cabin until he was
opposite the lighted window stoop-
ing he approached the window until
he was beneath it then inch by
inch he raised his head and peered
through the glass

 there was nobody inside the
cabin

  taking a desperate chance jim
hazel rounded the corner of the
cabin opened the door and stepped
inside a fire was burning in the
stove and on it a coffeepot was bub-
bling

  expecting that the desperadoes
might return at any moment jim
hazel made a quick search of the
cabin but he found no sign of the
gold

  believing that the suspected men
were in the mine jim hazel was
about to leave the cabin when sud-
denly he heard voices instantly
the ranger darted out of the cabin
and ran around a corner of it

  flattened against the log wall he
waited the voices grew louder
and in a few minutes jim hazel
saw two men coming down a beaten
trail in the snow which led from
the golden age mine to the cabin

  as black carver and sam gor-
rity drew nearer jim hazel heard
one of them speaking

  we sure put one over on the
ranger carver if folks ever find
out how he packed the gold to the
bank jim hazel will be the laugh-
ingstock of the thunder bird
range

  whatll we do with the danged
mail driver growled black carver
i aint never killed a man

ww-d
gold from thunderbolt



  i aint never killed nobody
either admitted sam gorrity
tell yuh what well do with the
mail driver lets make him work
in the mine until we get all the gold
safely in the bank by that time
well have figgered out some way of
gettin rid of snowbird williams
without bumping him off

  do yuh think the ranger was
fooled by our yarn black carver
asked his partner

  sure he was fooled boasted
gorrity anyway even if he came
back he couldnt arrest us unless
he found the gold and he aint
likely to find it

  as the two desperadoes entered
the cabin and closed the door jim
hazel drew his six-gun he was
about to burst into the cabin and
try to arrest the outlaws when sud-
denly he paused the thought had
struck him that even if he succeeded
in arresting them they might refuse
to disclose where they had hidden
the gold

  while jim hazel was trying to
make up his mind what to do the
cabin door opened and sam gor-
rity stepped outside in one hand
he carried a coffeepot and in the
other a plate of food without the
least suspicion that he was being
watched the desperado strode up
the moonlight-flooded trail toward
the golden age mine

  jim hazel waited until gorrity
was out of sight then the ranger
swiftly followed in a few minutes
jim hazel reached the mouth of a
tunnel which led into the golden
age mine

  taking his flashlight from his
pack jim hazel pressed the button
and entered the tunnel water
dripped on his head from rotting
timbers and the bright eyes of rats
glared at him out of the gloom as
deeper and deeper the ranger
ww-d

passed along the tunnel toward the
heart of the mountain

  he had covered a couple of hun-
dred feet when suddenly the sound
of voices brought him up short in
his tracks drawing his six-gun jim
hazel crept forward until he
reached the mouth of a tunnel
which ran at right angles to the one
he was in far ahead he could see
the faint glimmer of a light

  instantly jim hazel switched off
his own light

  in utter darkness now the young
ranger stole forward until he stood
at the entrance to an old pumping
station and there he paused

  seated on a huge pile of debris
which had fallen from the rotten
roof snowbird williams the van-
ished mail driver was eating his
supper sam gorrity stood watch-
ing him with a leveled six-gun in
his hand

  afraid that the desperado would
kill the mail driver if he made the
slightest sound jim hazel stood
watching and listening as sam
gorrity spoke

  so yuh think that ranger sus-
pected us of having stolen the gold
said gorrity

  sure replied the mail driver
itll take better men than you two
birds to fool jim hazel he has
probably gone to get the three
tigor boys to help him theyll kill
you and your partner as soon as
they get back

  the ranger wont get back
snarled gorrity ill tell carver
and well follow him and bump him
off before he reaches the tigor boys
cabin we cant take chances on
losing that gold now even if we
have to kill both the ranger and
them danged trappers at gunsight
lake

  what are you goin to do with
me asked the mail driver


street  smiths wild west weekly

  we was goin to have yuh work
in the mine for a while snarled the
desperado but after what yuhve
told me ill have to talk things over
with my partner i guess well jest
bump yuh off and leave yuh to rot
in the mine

  ordering snowbird williams to
rise to his feet sam gorrity lashed
him to a post

  im goin to take another look
at the gold growled the desper-
ado ill be back after a while

  leaving snowbird williams tied
to the post gorrity strode away
into the darkness waiting until he
could no longer see the light of the
outlaws candle jim hazel stepped
forward and freed the astonished
mail driver

  why didnt you kill the rat
while you had the chance ranger
asked snowbird williams

 because i want to find out
where the gold is hidden replied
jim hazel you stay here and
wait for me until i get back

iv

  paying no attention to the mail
drivers protests jim hazel hurried
in the direction taken by the des-
perado presently the ranger came
to another tunnel candle in hand
sam gorrity was stooping over a
pile of small bulging sacks

  intent on gloating over the stolen
gold sam gorrity did not hear jim
hazels approach until the ranger
tripped over a loose rock

  instantly gorrity blew out his
light and fired in the direction of
the sound red flame stabbed the
darkness and a bullet smacked into
the roof of the tunnel above jim
hazels head

  the crash of the rangers six-gun
was answered by another shot from
the desperado jim hazel fired at

the flash and the thud of a falling
body striking the ground was fol-
lowed by silence

  sam gorrity was dead when jim
hazel reached him sprawled on
his face he lay with his arms out-
spread on the sacks of stolen gold

  jim hazel stood a moment look-
ing down at the gold then he hur-
ried back to where he had left the
mail driver

  snowbird williams was gone

  wondering if the unarmed mail
driver had been foolish enough to
attempt the capture of black car-
ver jim hazel flashed the beam of
his torch around the pumping sta-
tion then suddenly he stepped
back a pace as a huge fragment of
rock broke loose from the roof and
crashed into a thousand fragments
at his feet

  before jim hazel could take an-
other step a threatening rumble
sounded overhead it was followed
by the thunder of caving ground as
tons of rock broke loose

  jim hazel felt a terrific blow on
the shoulder another one on the
side of his head hurled him from his
feet into blackness and silence like
that of the grave

  jim hazel opened his eyes to find
himself lying in darkness his head
was aching terribly and when he
tried to sit up he found he was
pinned down by a heavy weight
which rested on his chest

  horror numbed the rangers brain
at the thought that he might die
pinned down in the darkness shiv-
ers coursed through his body as he
listened to the squeaking of the big
gray mine rats scurrying around
among the fallen rock

  gathering himself together the
young ranger gave a terrific heave
and a huge chunk of rock rolled off
his chesst breathless from his
gold from thunderbolt



mighty effort and with his face and
body bruised in a dozen places jim
hazel managed to raise himself to
his hands and knees

  the fragment of rock striking his
shoulder had rendered his left arm
useless but his six-gun was still in
its holster and he was able to use
his right hand

  crouched in the dark jim hazel
listened to the tchk-tchk-tchk of
tiny fragments of rock dropping
from the rotten roof and he real-
ized that at any moment tons of
rock might break lose and bury him
alive

  foot by foot the injured ranger
crawled toward the tunnel which
led out of the old pumping station
just as he dragged himself into the
tunnel a blast of wind almost
knocked him from his feet as the
roof of the pumping station caved
again

  jim hazels torch had been
knocked from his hand and in utter
darkness he rose to his feet his
head was swimming with pain as
with right arm extended he felt his
way out of the mine which so nearly
had proved to be his grave

  as jim hazel staggered through
the darkness he no longer wondered
why the mail driver had left the
station evidently snowbird wil-
liams had realized that at any mo-
ment the roof might cave in

  after what seemed an eternity of
time jim hazel saw a glimmer of
daylight a shudder ran up the
rangers spine as he realized that all
night he had been lying unconscious
and that only providence had kept
the roof from caving and burying
him alive

  jim hazel reached the mouth of
the main tunnel at last leaning
against a wall he was gazing across
the snow-covered canyon at the
cabin when suddenly a rifle cracked

sharply a sliver of rock cut a
jagged gash in the rangers cheek as
a bullet struck the wall above his
head

  dropping to his knees jim hazel
peered across the canyon in search
of black carver for the ranger
guessed that somehow the desper-
ado had discovered that he was in
the mine and had been waiting to
kill him as he stepped outside the
tunnel

  the silence that followed the rifle
shot was broken by a bull-throated
shout from the cabin

  come out of there with yore
hands up ranger

  jim hazel did not answer
crouched against the wall of the
tunnel too far back from the en-
trance for black carver to see him
the forest ranger waited grimly
with his cocked six-gun in his right
hand

  an hour passed without anything
happening then suddenly black
carver sent a volley of rifle shots
into the mouth of the tunnel bul-
lets spanged into the roof above jim
hazels head and glanced off into
the darkness behind him

  several times tiny slivers of rock
cut the rangers face and hands
then the shooting ceased as sud-
denly as it had started

  presently jim hazel saw black
carvers bearded face peering
around an edge of the open cabin
door apparently puzzled at the
rangers silence the desperado was
gazing toward the mouth of the tun-
nel but still jim hazel made no
move

  after watching the tunnel for a
little while black carver leaped out
of the cabin rifle in hand gaining
the shelter of a fallen log he
crouched behind it then slowly a
hat appeared over the top of the
snow-covered log


street  smiths wild west weekly

  jim hazel grinned as he eyed the
hat for propped on the end of a
stick it was wabbling in a manner
which it could not possibly have
done had it been on a mans head
the hat disappeared after a few
minutes

  apparently convinced that one
of his btdlets had killed the ranger
black carver rose to his full height
still jim hazel held his fire

  slowly black carver strode to-
ward the tunnel now and again
he sought shelter behind a stump
of a tree but at last he came out
into the open and strode toward the
mine

  nearer he came and nearer still
while down on one knee jim hazel
waited with his six-gun covering the
approaching desperado

  yard by yard tiie outlaw came
up the hill until he was less than
a hundred feet from the ranger
then suddenly jim hazel leaped to
his feet sharp and clear his voice
rang out in the silence of the winter
morning

  up with your hands carver

  whipping his rifle to his shoulder
black carver blazed away just as
jim hazel fired a bullet clipped a
lock of hair from the forest rangers
head but shot through the stomach
the desperado toppled forward
quivered a moment then lay still

  hurrying forward jim hazel cast
one glance at the outlaw then the
ranger hurried to the cabin where
he found the mail driver bound hand
and foot

  i met carver just as i was leav-
ing the tunnel explained snow-
bird williams i told him you was
in the mine he was holding me as

hostage in case you got him cor-
nered in the cabin

  as jim hazel was releasing the
bound man he heard the tinkle of
sleigh bells stepping to the door
he glanced down the trail

  out of the depths of no mans
canyon came a dog team driven by
bill tigor behind it strode curt
and young gabe each carrying a
rifle in the crook of his arm bill
stopped the dogs as they reached
the cabin and stared at jim hazels
bruised and gashed face and at the
left arm of the young ranger which
dangled uselessly at his side

 we came to tell yuh that we
found where wolves had dug up the
bodies of the mail drivers dogs
jimmy drawled the mountaineer
they was killed by the fellers who
stole the gold a little farther on
we found the charred pieces of a
sled and some leather mail bags

 snowbird williams who was
standing beside the forest ranger
spat disdainfully into the snow

  that aint nothing to get het-up
over growled the old mail driver
while you was findin my dogs and
sled jim hazel shot it out with the
outlaws and recovered fifty thou-
sand dollars worth of vanished gold

  which same drawled bill tigor
will shore make histry in the
thunder bird range

  where them two crooks made their
big mistake was in figurin jim hazel ter
be as dumb as they were-the same mis-
take thet a hull herd of outlaws has made
afore em now theres two less o the
outlaw breed ter worry the ranger but
therell be another story about him as
he keeps on makin histry in the thun-
der birds in street  smiths wild

ment investigation groaned
colonel shelton and those
thieves whoever they are work
right under our confounded noses
it was an hour after nightfall and
the lonely little army outpost was
quiet on all sides stretched the
rugged wilderness of southern utah
the yellow lamp in the headquar-
ters building was the only light
burning the two worried officers
however had been nervously pac-
ing the floor since supper

  when do you think those two
u s marshals will get here colo-
nel sighed the major

  they ought to be here any time
now the colonel grunted as he
gave his white mustache an impa-
tient tug

  somehow i dont think theyll
be able to solve the problem the
major said gloomily

  well i dont know admitted
his superior officer these mar-
shals are experts in matters of
horse stealing and cattle rustling-
at least they ought to be one of
the men thats coming is johnny

tation they say for-

  a shout outside interrupted him
who goes there was the chal-
lenge in the darkness

  its the deputy marshals cried
the colonel with a sigh of relief

  he went to the door called out
an order to the guard and pres-
ently two shadowy riders were out-
lined in the gloom saddle leather
creaked as two men dismounted

  weve been expectin you sang
out the major come right on in
the first hombre to enter the
building was a fat man of about
forty who carried himself with an
air of importance a checkered
vest on which a silver badge glit-
tered was buttoned over his plump
stomach and he wore a gun on his
hip his double chins quivered as
he talked

  evenin gents evenin we got
yere as soon as we could

  the two army officers didnt see
the hombre behind him at first
the bulk of the fat deputy hid him
from view

  glad to see you greeted the
colonel warmly yore johnny

ficer indignantly my name is

words sung in a tuneful voice made
the two army officers gasp in aston-
ishment

johnny forty-fives my name

young officer coolly

  why yore nothin but a boy
ejaculated the major men are
needed on this job

  johnny forty-five looked sor-
rowful and yet it seemed to the
major and the colonel that he was
laughing at them his reply came
in rhyme

   i shore am mighty sorry
      that i am such a baby

but i have two guns for playthings
and i can use em maybe

  the colonels face turned purple
with anger

  im not used to being spoken to
in such insolent-poetry he fumed
if you can use those guns of yores
at all it would surprise me now
you listen to me

  he took the cigar from his mouth
and began to make motions with it
waving it wildly in the air as he
talked and sputtered

  there was a sudden burst of fire
and smoke from johnny forty-
fives left hip the windows rattled
with a terrific explosion it came
so fast that nobody saw the deputy
draw and when they looked at him
again his guns were back in their
holsters

  why you young whippersnap-

per- shouted the colonel his

face flushing angrily

  the bullet had neatly clipped the
cigar from his fingers without touch-
ing him

  excuse me murmured johnny
fofty-five it mustve went off
strange wasnt it
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



 er-i hope yuh wont mind
johnny put in deputy george
krumm hes sort o flighty yuh
know but he means well  course
im on the job and i usually sort
o keep the boy under my wing
now suppose we get down to busi-
ness whats the trouble down this
a way

  it was some time before the colo-
nel recovered himself enough to
talk he still wasnt certain
whether or not he had been the vic-
tim of an accident and he regarded
johnny forty-five with a suspicious
eye

  well i dont think youll be of
help to us he finally grunted but
you probably know that we have
nearly a thousand head of beef cat-
tle here at the army post-govern-
ment beef for the reservation and
so forth besides the longhorns we
always have about several hundred
horses

  and theyve been stealin em
from yuh inquired krumm tak-
ing the camp chair that was offered
him

  we dont know admitted the
major shaking his head in bewilder-
ment anyway weve been losing
our stock by the hundreds in some
way theres been no rustler raids
that we know of

  johnny forty-five was leaning
against the wall with his eyes half
closed he looked as if he was
asleep

  rustlin army cattle is a serious
business cried deputy george
krumm swelling his chest indig-
nantly ill catch em just leave
it to george krumm i always get
my man krumm never fails why
two years ago in colorado i-

  you probably are aware that
this will be mighty dangerous
work put in the major

  i dont know the meanin of

fear said the fat deputy no
siree ill run these rustlers to
earth course johnny yere might
be able to help me some-he some-
times does-but-

  are there many ranches here-
abouts said johnny sleepily open-
ing one eye

  yes this is a ranchin country
replied the major

  if yuh have a brand book
drawled johnny id like to take a
look at it

  we do have one grunted the
colonel giving johnny a hostile
look but i cant see that itll do
a bit of good to look at that

  how are yore stock branded
yawned johnny

  why with a u s said the colo-
nel just a large u s-meanin
government property

  i see johnny nodded just
let me have a look at the brand
book

  with a grunt of impatience the
colonel brought out the large vol-
ume in which the various brands
of the territory were recorded
johnny glanced through it leisurely
he took so much time that both the
major and the colonel were exasper-
ated

  you wont find anything there to
help you snapped the latter

  theyre right johnny said
deputy krumm yore wastin
time

  johnny however paid not the
slightest attention with the book
balanced on one knee he reached
for his makings and with unbe-
lievable rapidity rolled a cigarette
with his left hand

  to the amazement of the army
officers however he tossed it away
unlighted and then rolled a smoke
with his right hand this too he
threw away

  whats the idea of such fool do-


street  smiths wild west weekly

ings as that demanded the colo-
nel

  smokin cigs is bad for the eyes

and on the draw yuhll linger

   but rollin em is mighty fine
   to exercise the finger

  humph snorted the colonel as
he lighted a fresh cigar you must
be loco

  you wont find any clew in that
brand book anyway added the
major

  johnny looked up with a cheerful
grin

  i think ive already found it
he chuckled

chapter ii

a face at the window

what do yuh mean demanded
colonel shelton testily

  who owns this brand here-the

o	bar  asked johnny forty-five
and wheres the o bar  ranch
a mr jack kelso owns it said
shelton impatiently his ranch is
not far north of here

  is his brand a new one

  fairly so-about six months i
think the major declared but
why do you ask

  theres several ways to rustle
stock drawled the youthful dep-
uty one way is brand blottin
its sometimes easy to change one
brand into another one give me
that pencil colonel and a piece of
paper and ill show yuh

  although by no means convinced
they bent over johnny while he
slowly traced the following

u 

  there-thats the army brand
isnt it he grinned

  sure admitted colonel shelton
but-

  watch said johnny and he
added a few lines changing the de-
sign to one that looked like this

  why its the o bar  gasped
the major do yuh mean that

jack kelso-

  it looks a lot like it johnny
shrugged

  i dont believe it-not a word
of it cried the colonel stoutly
why i know this kelso he seems
a respectable rancher he wouldnt
do a thing like that besides who
would dare change the government
brand

  dinero means more than gover-
ment johnny said to some folks
heres another funny brand-the
pitchfork dollar

  the pitchfork dollar is owned
by dawes clarkson said colonel
shelton hes a man above re-
proach

  but not above robbin the gov-
erment of a few cattle and hosses
johnny grinned

 how can you suggest such a
thing snorted the colonel

  cattle detectives suggest all
sorts of things said johnny forty-
five cheerfully doesnt such a
brand as a pitchfork dollar seem
mighty peculiar to yuh heres
how it was done

  and johnny drew the following
beginning with the u s and add-
ing the additional lines

 the two army men exchanged
glances the major scratched his
head and the colonel tugged
thoughtfully at his mustache

  ill have to admit said shelton
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



finally that it does look strange

still i cant believe-

  the only thing that will con-
vince me said the major is a con-
fession from those two ranchers we
could never convict em on such evi-
dence as this

  johnny said krumm clearing
his throat importantly i think
yore off on the wrong foot now
if yuh leave this to me ill have
the mystery solved in jig time-and
without any fool monkey business
either

  anyway drawled johnny it
wont do any harm to pay a little
call to the  bar  and the pitch-
fork dollar will it

  the two army men shrugged and
didnt look enthusiastic

  thats up to you shelton
grunted all i want is to find out
whos stealing the camp live stock
both of yuh had better stay here
in camp to-night and to-morrow
you can do as you see fit ive given
up hope

  never fear colonel boasted the
fat deputy just leave it to ol
george krumm the terror of evil-
doers and--

  his jaw suddenly dropped and
his eyes went wide he pointed to
ward the window

  whats the matter demanded
the army men

  its gone-now gasped deputy
krumm but i saw it plain as
day it was pressed up against the
glass

  what was cried the colonel
a face gulped krumm nerv-
ously somebody was there-a
mexican i think

  but johnny had sprinted to the
door opening it he dashed out-
side they heard him circling the
building

  who was it called out the
colonel

  i missed him said johnny
breathlessly i saw his back but
i lost him in the darkness i didnt
want to shoot until i knew for shore

thet-

  what do yuh think he was up
to asked krumm uneasily

  an eavesdropper he probably
heard every word we spoke said
the younger deputy marshal
weve got to be more careful now
than ever hell probably warn the
guilty parties ahead of time

  none of the camp sentries had
seen anything of the intruders and
the army officers were greatly mys-
tified the listener by night had
vanished without a trace

chapter iii

    happenings in the night

yfter eating a late supper the
two deputy marshals were
shown to their quarters for the
night-a tent near the edge of the
encampment krumm had great
difficulty in worming his fat body
through the opening

  sleepin in tents dont appeal to
me none he groaned id rather
pound my ear right out in the
open

  johnny grinned as he followed
krumm inside

i dont know all yore reasons

     but i can think of one-

yuh dont want to be bothered by a tent
when the time comes for to run

  thet aint my reason at all
snorted the fat deputy yuh know
very well thet i never run i aint
afraid o nothin-not ol george
krumm no siree

  they threw themselves fully
dressed on the two cots groping in
the gloom for their blankets then
krumm remarked

who do yuh suppose thet hom-


street  smiths wild west weekly

bre was he shore had an ugly
face

  i have an idea that hell get in
touch with kelso and that dawes
clarkson hombre whoever he was
mused johnny and he might pay
us another call-and do more than
listen this time

  what makes yuh think thet
asked krumm his voice sounding
shaky in the darkness

  it might be profitable for those
brand blotters to put us out of the
way said johnny cheerily

  d-d-do yuh think s-s-so the
fat deputy stammered

  yore not afraid are yuh
george

  who me protested krumm
course i aint all i want is a
chance at somebody thets all i
aint smelled smoke fer some time
and im shore hankerin fer action
krumms hankering for action
however didnt keep him awake
long and soon his deep snores filled
the narrow confines of the tent the
rumbling of them fairly shook the
canvas walls

  johnny however lay wide awake
except for the measured step of the
sentry at long intervals all was si-
lence once a coyote yapped lone-
somely far out on the plain
johnny though was listening for
other sounds he had what is com-
monly known as a hunch

  an hour passed another another
johnny was just at the point of
dozing off when he heard a stealthy
tread-a step so quiet that only the
keenest of hearing could have dis-
tinguished it from the rustling of
the dry grass

  johnnys eyes were accustomed
to the gloom now but it was still
so dark that he could make out lit-
tle he heard a cautious scratching
noise as if somebody was trying to
wriggle under the edge of the tent

  johnny forty-fives hands closed
over the butts of his colts he
raised his voice in a chant

        come right in amigo

          and make yoreself at home
        heres a couple souvnirs-

          watch out for yore dome

  two scarlet streaks of fire flared
in the darkness of the tent followed
by twin explosions that rang out
like thunder

  there was a loud yell of pain and
dismay from the intruder and a
shout from deputy george krumm
as he fell from his cot floundering
among his blankets

  johnny he yelped what in
the-

  johnny forty-five listened to the
sound of feet scurrying away from
the tent and he grinned

  we had a caller he chuckled
but he lowed he wouldnt stay
none heres his callin card-a
steel one

  he struck a match and by its
light showed the fat deputy a long-
bladed mexican knife that had been
dropped by the would-be murderer
in his frantic flight

  g-g-golly krumm gulped it
was a mighty close call did yuh
hit him when yuh fired

  id gamble that i did-a little
johnny laughed i think well see
our mexican friend again

  groaning and mumbling to him-
self jose pacho beat a hurried re-
treat from the army camp once
he fell over a tent rope and got up
swearing as he ran he held his
hands to the sides of his head

  he escaped without being seen by
the sentries and quickly found his
wiry mexican cayuse which had
been hidden in a near-by arroyo
he stopped to tie his bandanna
handkerchief about his head before
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



mounting jose wasnt in a very
good humor

  he rode directly northward not
following the main wagon road but
taking a short cut through the ce-
dars after an up-and-downhill ride
of several miles he reached a spot
where two well-traveled trails came
together

  by this time the east was begin-
ning to grow light with the ap-
proaching dawn in spite of the
hour however there was a gleam
of lamplight from a building near
the junction the mexican spurred
his pony on at a faster clip and
swung out of the saddle at the fork
in the road

  the light came from the grimy
windows of a saloon known as the
crossroads bar-a small ramshackle
building but with an evil appear-
ance it had once been painted red
but now the paint was peeling off
and the roof had been patched with
tin a more hideous place prob-
ably didnt exist within a hundred
miles

  jose tied his horse went to the
door and pushed it open the sin-
gle large room was blue with ciga-
rette smoke and rank with the
fumes of bad whisky late as the
hour was a half dozen men were
at the bar or at the card tables
and there was one woman-a mexi-
can girl

  have you come at last father
she called out even before the oth-
ers realized that jose had entered
she spoke in spanish

  yes where ees kelso-and
clarkson cried jose irritably

  whats up jose demanded a
heavy thickset hombre with a knife-
scarred lip and beetling black eye-
brows it was kelso the owner of
the near-by o bar  rancho

  mucho ees the matter snarled
the mexican fingering his head

  whats the matter with yore
ears questioned another of the
men in the saloon

  with an oath jose paeho re-
moved the bandanna both ears
had been neatly drilled through
with  bullets

  thees is what ees the matter
groaned the mexican i watch the
army oampo like you tell me
kelso he explained excitedly
two deputy hombres they come
about cattle

  what growled kelso deep in
his throat

  the others all pressed close
around eager to hear what jose had
to tell them they were a hard-
looking lot all heavily armed and
bore the cruel look of professional
killers

  it ees true already thees two
men they savvy who changes the
cattle brands panted jose and
the mexican told the others what
he had learned by listening outside
the headquarters window

  those two marshals have got to
be taken care of-and yuh all know
which way i mean snarled kelso
in a fury theyll spoil our game
in no time whats their plans
jose

  they plan to come see you
grunted jose to-day

  good kelso grinned hear
thet clarkson

  yeah said a tall evil-faced
hombre with greenish lynx eyes
theyll git moren they bargain fer
if they come out to the pitchfork
dollar

  but papacita how were your
ears hurt asked the mexican girl
who seemed to be joses daughter
she had tossed aside the black ciga-
rette she had been smoking and
now her eyes flashed angrily

  the little hombre i think-he
ees a devil-he ees not human


street  smiths wild west weekly

pacho stormed all the time he
sing like loco man shoot like loco
man

  what yuh mean by sing ques-
tioned the owner of the pitchfork
dollar

  tra-la-la-like that all time
grunted the mexican in deep dis-
gust he name johnny forty-
five

  humph sneered kelso well
fix him and thet other depity too
pickins is too easy to let them spoil
it fer us is the army wise to whats
been goin on

 no they not believe what
johnny he say but johnny say he
prove said the mexican

  i hate them both padre ex-
claimed the girl fiercely we will
make them pay for what they have
done to you

  well all of yuh gather round
close kelso snarled and well
make our plans with us warned
them two depities aint got a chance
in the world now listen close to
what im goin to say

  as kelso talked in a low tone
making each plan in detail the hard
faces of the gunmen relaxed into
evil grins dawes clarkson too
had something to say and when all
had been agreed to they went to
the bar to have a drink on it al-
ready dangers were gathering on
the horizon for johnny forty-five
and george krumm

chapter iv

krumm changes his mind

at six oclock that morning the
two deputy united states mar-
shals left the army encampment
riding northward into the cedar-
clad mountains johnny was riding
a wiry little roan pony while
krumm jolted up and down on the
back of a chestnut horse that

seemed about to collapse with his
weight at any moment

  i hope it aint far krumm mut-
tered which ranch do yuh aim
to visit first johnny

  the o bar  because its near-
est said johnny then well ride
on up to the pitchfork dollar

  i think were on a wild-goose
chase groaned krumm if yuhd

listen to me-

  if my idea dont work then well
try yores said johnny but
whats this up ahead

  they now found themselves at
the fork in the two trails and
johnny and krumm caught a
glimpse of a building ahead of them
in the cedars

  crossroads bar spelled out
krumm as they came abreast of it
its a saloon whod have thought
wed find one away out yere

  it does seem strange agreed
johnny

  yuh know i think i need a
drink said krumm huskily i
never drink o course all i do is
take some for my cough now and
then lets stop a minute

  seems to me that yuh have a
cold most of the time johnny
grinned what causes yore cough

i	notice that it always gets worse
when we get close to saloons

  i got a gun-smoke cough said
krumm seriously

  a what

  a gun-smoke cough-on account
o me inhalin so much powder
smoke in my time yuh know the
fat deputy explained

  its too bad chuckled johnny
but we havent time to make any
stops now on the way back we
might call at the crossroads bar
and take a look around some of
that rustler gang might use it for
a hang-out

  they trotted on following the
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



wide sweep of the road as it climbed
on toward the northwest six or
eight miles farther on if the colo-
nels directions had been correct
they would come upon the o bar 
spread

  it was a wild and rugged country
over which many herds of cattle
ranged cedars and pinons grew
on the higher rocky slopes and the
desertlike floor of the valley was
dotted with mesquites square-
topped mesas blocked off the west-
ern horizon in a series of steps and
over all was a deep-blue sky and a
golden sun

  give yore cayuse the spur
george said johnny after another
mile of riding and well see if we
cant get near enough to that bunch
of longhorns to make out the
brands

  krumm was a poor rider and
johnny left him far behind as he
galloped over the flats toward a
small and very much startled beef
herd the cattle ran like wild
things but johnny learned what he
wanted

  just as i thought he told the
fat deputy there were two o
bar  calves there runnin with u s
mothers queer aint it

  krumm scratched his head it
does seem funny mebbe them cows
didnt have any calves of their owtn
so they adopted a couple

  i think kelso sort of helped out
in the adoptin said johnny
grimly lets be goin on

  what are we goin to do when
we get there asked krumm un-
easily

  i think we have enough on -kelso
to arrest him returned johnny
forty-five

  w-w-will there be t-t-trouble
krumm faltered turning a shade
paler

  we might get killed of course

said johnny coolly but i dont
think therell be much trouble
dont yuh call that trouble
groaned the fat deputy course i
aint afraid to face gunfire-not ol

george krumm but-

  not to change the subject it
seems the trail forks here again
pointed out johnny forty-five

  which road will we take now
krumm wanted to know

  theres a signboard maybe that
will tell us observed the younger
deputy riding his pony closer to a
roughly lettered piece of board that
had been nailed to a pine tree near
the fork in the trail

  it bore a grim message and there
was no mistaking what was meant
johnny read it

     o	bar  ranch
   visitors not wanted -

   bo of hill raveyard
 - visitors welcome

  well george said johnny i
guess we go to the right and he
nodded toward the arrow that
pointed due north

 krumms jaw had dropped and
his eyes protruded his double
chins trembled and he moistened
his lips feverishly

  i-i dont think ill g-g-go with
yuh johnny he stuttered

 why not johnny chuckled
yuh shorely dont mean that yore
goin in the other direction-toward
the boot hill graveyard

  n-n-no of course not the fat
deputy said feebly im goin back
-toward the pitchfork dollar
ranch yuh know dont yuh think
it would be a better idea if i left
the  bar  to yuh while i tackle
the pitchfork dollar


street  smiths wild west weekly

 that would be a muy bueno
idea george if yuhd do it agreed
johnnv it would be nice if we
could strike the two ranches at once
so they wouldnt be able to warn
each other

  then thets what ill do said
krumm with a great sigh of relief

  are yuh shore yuh wont high-
tail it back to the army camp
johnny drawled

 who me the fat deputy
cried indignantly yuh must think
im a coward johnny let me tell
yuh thar aint one bit o cowardice
in ol george krumm no siree
im with yuh to the last ditch
well when we get to the last
ditch johnny chuckled just be
shore yuh aint hidin in it adios
then well meet later

  krumm was only too anxious to
turn his horse and head back in the
way they had come johnny roll-
ing a cigarette first with one hand
and then with the other rode jaun-
tily on toward the o bar -where
visitors werent wanted

chapter v

two captures

johnny forty-five rode
j boldly down into the little sink
where the buildings of the kelso
ranch were huddled

  it was then about nine in the
morning but the deputy saw no
signs of life about the rancho and
this struck him at once as peculiar
and served to put him on his guard

  he saw nobody as he left the nar-
row road to descend among the
thick cedars that- hid the hacienda
the house which was built in the
spanish style seemed deserted
there were a few horses moving
among the mesquites of a large
barbed-wire corral but aside from
these the ranch seemed empty

  he dismounted near the long low
bunk house which was covered with
black tar paper and had windows of
oiled paper he thumped on the
door and as nobody answered him
he pushed against it

  but there was no reply to his
cheerful chant

   its only johny forty-five

   makin a friendly call

but if any one wants trouble

start rollin yore little ball

  there was nobody in the bunk
house but johnny got the impres-
sion that he smelled fresh cigarette
smoke as he himself didnt smoke
his nose was keen it was a warn-
ing of danger

  leaving the bunk house he strode
directly toward the hacienda whis-
tling as he walked although he
knew that he might be ambushed
and shot down without mercy at
any moment his impudent face was
as carefree as ever

  anybody home he sang out as
he reached the rear door

 there was no response and
johnny tried the latch to see if the
door was unfastened it was it
swung wide against the pressure of
his shoulder

  if its a trap theyre slow about
springin it johnny thought as he
stepped into the kitchen

  there was nobody there and no-
body could have been hiding in the
room as no piece of furniture was
large enough to conceal a man the
stove was near the door and johnny
put his hand to it the stove was
still warm almost hot

  if theres any one here im ad-
visin em to show themselves the
young deputy called out

  the door leading to the other
rooms was closed step by step he
walked slowly toward it it was
ticklish work and his nerves tin-
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



gled the fireworks he knew might
start at any moment and he was
at a huge disadvantage

   he had just reached forward for
 the doorknob in order to explore the
 rest of the house when it happened

   the door wras flung wide open
 and he caught a quick confused
 glimpse of several armed men

   we got yuh kid rasped an ex-
 ulting voice stick em up

   johnnys lithe hands darted to-
 ward his hips but before his guns
 could get into action he felt a
 strange and terrible sensation of
 falling the floor seemed to open
 up beneath his feet

   he had stepped upon a trapdoor
 the spring had been released and
 there was nothing under him but
 emptiness

   the deputy tried in vain to clutch
 at the sides of the opening through
 which he was plunging but it had
 all happened too suddenly spin-
 ning over backward he shot through
 the floor and into darkness

  there was a loud laugh from
above then a terrific impact as
johnnys head struck solid ground
a dozen feet below lights seemed
to flash before his eyes like stars
as the force of the fall knocked the
breath from his body bells rang in
his ears-then silence he lost con-
sciousness

   he could not have been senseless
 very long before he felt rough hands
 grasping him then some one
 kicked him in the side he could
 see little and was too weak to put
 up much of a struggle

   hes just stunned he heard
 somebody mutter and then it
 seemed as if he was being pulled
 and pushed up a steep ladder

   with daylight shining in his face
again johnny forty-five opened his
eyes his head ached and pounded
kbut already he was recovering

  he remembered now that sudden
breath-taking drop through the
trapdoor four or five evil-faced
jaspers were gathered about him
now he was flat on the floor and
one of the heaviest was kneeling on
the muscles of his arms while an-
other held him helpless

  well so we got the slick depity-
marshal kid without firin a shot
taunted a mocking voice i reckon
we can show the law a few tricks
theyve never heard of smart
wasnt he but not smart enough

  a knife-scarred face stared down
into johnnys own

  know who i am kid he leered

  johnny made no reply

  well im kelso-jack kelso
came the angry snarl

  johnny forty-fives answer came
in a tuneful singsong-a rhyme so
gay that it seemed as if nothing un-
usual had happened

   cant say im glad to meet yuh

yore face is too ugly for that

   if i were you heres what id do

  id hide it with my hat

  kelso gnashed his teeth in fury
and he shook his big fist in his pris-
ntiprs fapf

  make fun o my face eh he
rasped yore goin to get yores
never fear and in a way yuh wont
like yore face will look plenty bad
when im through with it whars
thet pard o yores--the fat jasper

  i expect yuhd better try and
find that out yoreself said the dep-
uty coolly

  a shower of blows and kicks fol-
lowed this but they failed to wipe
the smile from johnnys lips when
they had tired of their abuse they
bound their captive tightly with
lariat rope and dragged him outside

  well get yore pard never doubt
it kid kelso sneered and yuh
both are goin fer a long long ride


street  smiths wild west weekly

all right welton lift him on thet

hoss

  where to now boss asked a
whiskered gunman

  to the pitchfork dollar i
reckon said kelso evilly but fust
well stop off a bit at the crossroads
bar

  deputy marshall george krumm
wasnt any too anxious to ride to
the pitchfork dollar spread in fact
he was particularly anxious not to
the more he saw of the business at
hand the less he liked it

  johnnys too impulsive he
muttered as he jogged along too
danged impulsive it aint the way
to solve cases like this no siree
no use rushin headlong into such
things

  he hadnt yet made up his mind
where to go or what to do when he
came within sight of the crossroads
bar that decided george krumm

  i might just as well go in there
and wait for johnny-bein as hes
on a wild-goose chase anyway he
thought

  he dismounted outside tied his
horse to the hitch rail and strutted
across the wooden porch to the
swinging green doors

  inside the saloon he looked about
him with a sigh of great relief

  this is more like it he mut-
tered its just the place to spend
a quiet hour or two

  at first krumm saw nobody in
the room but the stony-eyed bar-
tender then he became conscious
that a spanish senorita was occupy-
ing one of the tables krumm im-
mediately swelled out his chest
bowed and doffed his hat with a
gallant gesture

  way-noze deez senorita he
said with what he imagined to be
a perfect spanish accent

  he failed to catch the angry flash

of lupe pachos big black eyes it
was instantly replaced however by
a look of guile and a dazzling smile
poor krumm was done for from
that moment on

  wont yuh have a drink senor-
ita he offered

 i nevair drink but thanks
senor lupe said sweetly

  i never do either except for my
cough said the fat deputy as he
called for whisky straight

  krumm was always talkative es-
pecially when he had an audience
the first drink called for another
and krumms tongue became loos-
ened and the gay senorita seemed
interested

  yes siree im a deputy united
states marshal announced krumm
proudly savvy u s marshal
senorita

  oh si sir senor she beamed
you must be ver brave man

  i dont know the meanin of the
word fear  said krumm as he
lighted a cigar just a few weeks
ago i captured a bunch o stage rob-
bers single-handed-that is almost
single-handed i had my young
partner with me but o course i did
most of the shootin to say nothin
of the brain work

 lupe gave him a languishing
smile you are ver handsome
man too she sighed

  krumms pink face became even
pinker with pleasure he smoothed
back his bristly hair and mustache

  im no beauty o course he ad-
mitted but i know theres some-
thin fascinatin about the strong-
and-rugged type like what i am
thees gun with which you keel
so many-may i see it senor
coaxed the gay senorita

  i couldnt refuse a lady any-
thing krumm smiled broadly
ill be only too glad to let yuh see
it

  hsm-eached for the gun at his hip
and drew it out he handed it to
the girl with a gallant bow

 she took the gun and-to
krumms horrified amazement-
spun it with practiced ease on her
forefinger lined the sights with the
big deputys heart and covered him
with it

  say lady dont do thet-yuh

may- krumm gasped out

  but lupe pachos was a woman
transformed she glared at krumm
like a tigress and she pressed the
gun muzzle so hard against his ribs
that he gasped with fright

  at the same moment the rear
door of the saloon swung open and
a half dozen hard-faced desperadoes
slipped in from the back room where
they had been in hiding all held
six-guns in their hands

  get yore paws up yuh fat stiff
snarled the foremost

  krumm nearly fainting obeyed
the command so suddenly he nearly
dislocated his arms

  bueno now freeze ordered
one of the gunmen if yuh move
well ventilate yore clothes while
yore still in em

  if the bar hadnt been there to
hold krumm up he would probably
have fallen to the floor in terror as
it was great drops of cold sweat be-
gan to trickle down his forehead

  you beeg fool taunted lupe
thees is what you get for shoot-
ing my padre in hees ears

  b-b-but i didnt do it honest
stammered the fat deputy in mis-
ery yuh must mean my p-p-pard-
ner johnny forty-five i didnt do
nothin to anybody

does savvy who i am well

to thet	

  yuh w-w-wouldnt k-k-kill me

  clarkson and his gunmen ex-
changed glances and winked know-
ingly then the owner of the pitch-
fork dollar spoke again

  if i give yuh one chance fer yore
life will yuh leave the country and
never come back he asked sneer -
ingly

  ill do anything yuh say gulped
krumm

  bueno said dawes clarkson
with a smile then sign the note
im goin to write

  he demanded pen and paper from
the bartender and scrawled a mes-
sage of a few lines when he had
finished he read the following
aloud

  to colonel shelton my pard and
ine have found thet we was wrong about
the o bar  and the pitchfork dollar bein
mixed up in russled army cattle goodby
we are leavin the country fer reasons of
our own

  krumm groaned and at first re-
fused to sign such a letter under
the revolvers of the clarkson gun-
men however he weakened

  all right ill s-s-s-sign he
gasped

  yuhd better leered clarkson
and he handed krumm the pen

  the fat deputys hand shook so
that he could hardly write his name
but he had just signed it when the
sound of horses hoofs was heard
outside one of the desperadoes
peered through the front door

  its kelso he announced with
a grin and hes got the other dep-
ity marshal with him tied up like
a roped hawg

  everythings workin out fine
said the pitchfork dollar owner and
he rubbed his hands together glee-
fully

in hot water

fawes clarksons first or-
der terrified krumm for he told
his men to search the big deputy
carefully and tie him up

  b-b-but i thought yuh said
yuhd let me g-g-go if i signed thet
letter to the colonel he stammered

  dawes clarkson threw his evil
head back and roared with unwhole-
some laughter his men joined with
him in a chorus of hearty guffaws

  yuh fat fool do yuh think i
meant thet he mocked yuh fell
fer it hook line and sinker didnt
yuh yuh know too danged much
fer us to let yuh live even if we
wanted to-and we dont want to
yuh got to die along with yore kid
pard

  krumm wilted at this news and
if the others hadnt held him up-
right he would have dropped in a
faint

  but thet letter- he bleated

finally

  yuh was a fool to sign it
clarkson grinned it just makes
it easier fer us thets all and it
covers our tracks nobody will ever
find yore bodies well take good
care o thet and our brand-fixin
game will go on just like alius

  all he did was give us a blamed
good alibi snickered one of clark-
sons henchmen hadnt yuh bet-
ter send thet message to the army
camp right away chief

 good idea the pitchfork
owner nodded and he sent one of
his riders toward the distant en-
campment with the letter to which
krumm had so lucklessly attached
his name

  in the meantime kelso and his
men had pulled up in front of the
crossroads bar with their pris-
oner johnny forty-five

  when krumm saw johnny he al-
most burst into tears

  i wish now id stayed with you
johnny he moaned things
might have turned out different

  in spite of the seriousness of the
situation johnny couldnt help
laughing at the sight of krumms
woebegone face he broke into his
old familiar chant

cheer up george and crack a smile
while theres life there shore is hope
well introduce these buzzards yet
to the jail house and the rope

  yeah sneered kelso who had
stopped to shake hands with his
partner in crime dawes clarkson
yuhll change thet tune o yores
afore long kid

  this fathead yere has just signed
a letter to the colonel thet he and
his pard was leavin the country
guffawed clarkson thet shore
will cover up our trail

 good work dawes cackled
kelso slapping his leg well
whats on the program now

  they talked for a time and then
it was decided that the two prison-
ers would be taken to a lonely shack
on the pitchfork dollar ranch by
clarkson and his men kelso would
return to his ranch in order to cover
things up as much as possible

  and whatll i do with em when
we get em to the shack kelso
laughed clarkson unpleasantly

  the last time i was thar said
kelso i noticed a square wooden
box remember whats in it well
does thet give yuh an idea

  clarkson stared at kelso for a
moment and then broke into an
ugly chuckle

i get yuh kelso trust yuh to
think o thet i aint got any more
use fer thet shack anyway so we
might a-s well do the job up right
well be careful o thet rhymin
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



kid grunted kelso as he swung
back into his saddle hes a slip-
pery little whelp good luck

  the o bar  riders joined their
leader and rode back toward their
home headquarters in a cloud of
dust leaving the two prisoners with
dawes clarkson and his five men
one of these was jose pacho-the
mexican whom johnny had marked
with six-gun slugs he gave johnny
an evil glance and told clarkson
that he was going to remain behind
with his daughter

  darn thet mex girl krumm
groaned but its yore fault
johnny if yuh hadnt shot up her
padre she wouldnt have trapped
me

  lets get started clarkson
scowled

  krumm was placed on his own
horse and securely tied to the sad-
dle the others gathered close
about the two prisoners eager to
shoot if they attempted an escape
and the riders started on their way
toward the pitchfork dollar

  were ridin to our deaths
johnny krumm groaned

  oh i dont know about that
johnny grinned cheerfully some
of these jaspers might be ridin to
theirs

  shut up blast yuh growled
clarkson when yuh know what
were goin to do to yuh yuhll
change thet tune o yores

  johnny had been straining at his
bonds ever since leaving the kelso
ranch but the desperadoes had
done their work well and every ef-
fort seemed to tighten instead of
loosen the ropes as for krumm
he was sunk too deep in despair to
do anything but groan

  at a brisk pace the party climbed
into the hills north of the cross-
roads no help was to be had for
law had not yet come to that part

of the southwest and there was no
chance that they would meet any
one the way became more and
more lonely the trail dwindled to
a mere track and the desolate
mountains rose higher on every side

  they all left the trail together
and then penetrated deep into a
forest of scrub pine when this
thinned out they found themselves
on the rim of a valley here they
struck another dim trail and an-
other half hour brought them to a
clearing in the center of which was
a shack clumsily built of logs

  it was not the headquarters of
the pitchfork dollar outfit but
served as a cow camp during the
round-up and branding seasons
nobody was about and the rank
yellow grass grew knee-high no
more dreary or more out-of-the-way
place could have been imagined

  yeres whar we git off grunted
clarkson yuh two depities had
better take a good look at the
scenery its goin to be yore last

  johnny and krumm were roughly
pulled from their horses and still
bound with lariat ropes were
dragged into the shack

 d-d-dont kill us krumm
moaned his broad face as white as
paper

 george said johnny with a
smile if weve got to die lets do
it like united states marshals

  wait till yuh see what wvre go-
in to do sneered clarkson

  and they werent kept long in
suspense as to the method chosen
for their end the shack was bare
of any furniture except for a few
boxes and clarkson opened one of
these with the rusty head of a
hatchet he picked up from a cor-
ner it seemed to be full of saw-
dust

 dynamite krumm gulped as
clarkson carefully unloaded a pile


street  smiths wild west weekly

of plump sticks covered with greasy
yellow paper

  yeah leered the pitchfork dol-
lar owner this shows what we do
to cattle snoopers out in this neck
o the woods were goin to blow
yuh both to kingdom come

chapter vii

ten feet of fuse

jrumm s teeth began to chatter

    he tried to speak but no sound
came both prisoners had been
thrown helplessly into a corner of
the shack and with horrified eyes
they watched clarkson make his
terrible preparations

  it seemed impossible that such
an inhuman set of scoundrels could
exist the death of course would
be sudden and merciful enough
when it came but the idea of it
was hideous

 one of the men brought out a
square tin of dynamite caps and be-
gan inserting these into the ends of
the sticks to one of these a sec-
tion of fuse was attached then the
dynamite was replaced in the box a
coil of white fuse about ten feet in
length emerging from it

  when these things had been done
to clarksons satisfaction he turned
to one of his gunmen with an order
now tie them two to thet scant-
lin thar in the corner we dont
want em rollin over on the floor
toward the dynamite they might
try to bite the fuse or somethin
this was soon done george
krumm and johnny forty-five be-
ing trussed to a beam out of reach
of the explosive clarkson evi-
dently believed that anything worth
doing is worth doing well

 krumm seemed too frightened
even to beg for mercy now all his
bravado had fled from him and he
shook like an aspen leaf in a gale

  got anything to say afore we
leaves yuh clarkson grinned as
he lighted a cigarette and blew a
contemptuous cloud of smoke to-
ward his two victims

  krumms feeble wail was drowned
out by hoarse laughs from the oth-
ers clarkson took a pint flask of
whisky from his hip pocket and
waving it derisively asked krumm
if he wranted something to brace
him up

  krumm had no reply to this but
johnny had and it came in his usual
singsong

     have yore fun amigo

just go ahead and drink

      but theres a pay day cornin

maybe sooner than yuh think

  clarkson took a final swig from
the flask and then with an oath
he hurled the empty bottle at
johnny it struck the young mar-
shal in the ribs

  thets fer you he sneered all
right boys light thet fuse and
well be ridin from yere

  a match was struck and in an-
other moment the fuse was sput-
tering flame

  adios called out clarkson
mockingly and then turned and left
the shack after the others johnny
heard them mount and ride slowly
away

  well george johnny panted
weve got to do somethin-now
or never

  were goners groaned the fat
deputy hopelessly

  and it seemed as if they were
already a foot or more of the fuse
had burned and the blackened end
was curling upward in the smoke
it made a steady hiss like that of
a snake

  i think-he made a mistake
johnny gasped when he threw
that bottle-at me
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



  it had dropped near his feet and
with an effort johnny raised his
bound ankles from the ground and
let his boot heels drop on the flask
there was a crunching sound as it
smashed

  what good-is thet-goin to do
us krumm wailed

  only one chance-in a million
george muttered the younger dep-
uty who was already busy

  the flask was of heavy glass and
had broken almost exactly in half
by wriggling and kicking with his
feet johnny had already managed
to get it beneath his body now if
he could only bring the ropes in
contact with the sharp edge

  he felt a twinge of pain as he cut
his forearm slightly but he only set
his teeth and worked the harder
the rope that bound him to the
scantling didnt give him much lee-
way it was awkward painful work
and agonizingly slow

  hurry fer petes sake johnny
bleated krumm

  how much of the fuse is left
asked johnny without looking
split seconds were precious now

  its nearly half gone krumm
screeched

  zz-z-z-z-zz the steady hissing
of the fuse warned of awful death
sweat was dripping from johnnys
face but already he felt a strand of
rope give way

  but all the other strands were
harder to cut through time after
time the piece of bottle slipped out
of position and each time he worked
it back again the shack was al-
ready half filled with smoke from
the burning fuse the fiery end of
which shone like a red eye

  only three feet left sobbed
krumm well be blown sky-high
in another two minutes

  there wasnt much doubt of that
there was enough dynamite in the

box to wipe the shack from the map
-and about an acre of ground along
with it

  im gettin loose johnny cried
keep up yore courage well make
it yet

  whatever yuh do dont start
singin yore fool poetry now
krumm groaned

  johnny was singing in his heart
at least for a final jerk of his pow-
erful arms broke the lariat and he
clawed the ropes from his tired body
and lurched to his feet

  get me out of this-quick the
fat deputy pleaded only two feet
o fuse left

  johnnys fingers in their eager-
ness to free his friend seemed all
thumbs and it seemed ages before
the first knot had been loosened
at last however he untied the knot
that held krumm to the beam then
the one at his wrists just as
krumm whose eyes were toward
the door yelled

  look out johnny

  johnny spun on the heels of his
boots

  there in the open doorway stood
dawes clarkson

       chapter ix
       fightin some

awes clarkson had come
back to the shack for a final
taunt and to make sure that his
victims hadnt freed themselves

  he had timed the fuse by his
watch knew how long it would burn
almost to the second and so be-
lieved himself to be taking no risks
when he left his men to return to
the shack alone

  but it was different now

  clarksons greenish eyes went
wide with amazement when he saw
what wtas taking place and his
hands slid toward his six-guns


street  smiths wild west weekly

  johnny forty-five however had
been through too much to lose the
game so easily now

  ducking low to the floor he
hurled the heavy fragment of the
glass bottle at the brand blotters
head at the same time leaping for-
ward

  smash the whizzing missile
struck clarkson on top of the head
staggering him and breaking to bits

  before he could recover himself
or bring his guns into play johnny
forty-five was upon him like a wild
cat

  come on yuh thievin cutthroat

       a fight i cant resist

   yore face is good for just one thing-
      a place to put my fist

  thump johnny lashed out at
clarksons jaw knocking his head
against the wall

  clarkson had reeled into the
shack now and was trying desper-
ately to jerk his six-guns from their
holsters johnny had already closed
one eye and the rustlers cheek was
bruised the deputy was nailing
him with showers of rights and lefts

 johnny for the love o-

krumms voice screamed

  the fuse was still sputtering and
only inches of it now remained

  clarkson too became aware of
the peril he was in he tried to
jump backward through the door
and escape from the shack his
one thought now was to get as far
away as possible before the explo-
sion came

  but johnny forty-five had him
by both arms now and had other
ideas about it

  let go squalled clarkson in a
frenzy of fear the dynamite
let me go blast yuh

  krumm whose legs were still
tied had managed to get to his feet
and was hopping toward the door

  ill have those guns first clark-
son snapped johnny

  the rustler was far too frightened
now to make any resistance and the
young deputy wrenched them free
as he did so he sent clarkson
sprawling outside writh a straight-
arm job to the chin then he
turned to help krumm

  zz-zzzz-z-zzz the fuse was hiss-
ing down to the last inch

  krumm squeaked like a fright-
ened rabbit as johnny picked him
up bodily and ran with him

  clarkson too had scrambled to
his feet and was running for his life
then the explosion came

  the force of it knocked all three
men to the ground although they
were eighty yards from the shack
there was a terrific gust of wind
and the air seemed full of dust and
flying objects the ground shook
and there was a brilliant red flash
the noise of it roared in their ears
for minutes afterward

  well clarkson get up johnny
sang out when he could find the
breath to speak yore under ar-
rest

  clarksons bruised face twisted
into a grimace of fear johnny had
him covered with the rustlers own
guns

  d-d-dont shoot he pleaded

  hold him krumm im goin
to have my hands full in a minute
johnny ordered here come the
rest o the gang

  sure enough five riders were
sweeping through the trees at the
lower end of the little valley hear-
ing the explosion and wondering
what had become of their leader
they had hurried back to see

  johnny let them get within a
hundred yards before letting them
know how matters stood then his
guns barked sharply and two of
the oncoming horsemen went turn-
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



bling from their saddles each with
a punctured shoulder

  the young deputys voice rang
out over the gunfire

  yuhve had yore way just long enough
    its time to pay the bill

  stick em up yuh buzzards

     or i will shoot to kill

  the gang was dazed and bewil-
dered at this turn of affairs but
the rustlers still had a lot to learn
with the mistaken idea that they
could turn the tide of battle they
came charging in

  with bullets kicking up the
ground all about him johnny coolly
made good his word drilling the
foremost desperado through the
body with a wild cry the outlaw
slid from his horse lifeless

  that was hint enough the rest
surrendered

  and now george chuckled
johnny it becomes yore painful
duty to decorate these jaspers with
their own lariats tie em up good

  krumm had recovered his usual
bravado with a broad smile on
his face he went to work at truss-
ing up the prisoners while johnny
kept them covered with a pair of
six-guns that still smoked a little

  it was a crestfallen bunch of
brand blotters who left a few min-
utes later in the custody of two
u s marshals they still hadnt
recovered from their amazement
and clarkson was swearing softly
and steadily under his breath

  we shore done the job up right
didnt we johnny krumm ex-
ulted ill see thet yuh get some
o the credit fer this capture o
course it was my brains thet
planned it all out but ill admit
yuh done fine

  krumm yuh plumb overwhelm
me sighedjohnny

  i reckon wed better take these

jaspers right to the army camp
hadnt we exclaimed krumm with
enthusiasm

  johnny rolled a cigarette and
tossed it over his shoulder absent-
mindedly

  i was just thinkin krumm that
wed better cut across country
straight west

  but what fer the fat deputy
demanded

  uncle sam yuh know craves
the company of a certain senor
kelso johnny drawled the gov-
erment wants to confer a great
honor on him-present him with
free board and lodgin the rest of
his life if any

  krumms spirits sank hadnt
we better leave well enough alone
he quavered hes got several

gunmen and-

  yore part of it will be to take
charge o the prisoners-ill try and
add to em johnny forty-five
grinned ill ride on ahead and
see what i can do about friend
kelso

  mebbe thets a better idea ad-
mitted george krumm brightening
these prisoners are mighty desper-
ate hombres and it will take a
blamed good man to keep tab on
em

chapter x

at the o bar 

jt was late in the afternoon when
johnny caught sight of the kelso
spread and near the supper hour
he had left krumm and the cap-
tives several miles behind and now
he rode down into the basin alone

  the ranch seemed as deserted as
it had been early that morning but
this time he knew what to do
kelso and his men suspected noth-
ing and were probably eating sup-
per

the surprise would be the other


street  smiths wild west weekly

way around this time johnny took
advantage of every bit of cover and
knowing the lay of the land now he
approached the hacienda on its
blind side making sure that nobody
could spy him from the windows

  therell be no trapdoors this
time thought johnny forty-five
grimly but ill bet kelso wishes
he had one to duck through

  making no noise he dismounted
on the far side of the bunk house
and walked silently to the back door
of the ranch house

  scarcely breathing he listened at
the chink in the partly opened door
he heard mens voices loud laughs
and an occasional oath

  he heard kelso say something he
didnt catch followed by more
laughter all seemed to be in great
good humor and evidently they
were congratulating themselves
there seemed to be five or six of
them and they were eating supper
for johnny heard the rattle of
knives and forks and the jangle of
tin plates

  pass them beans over yere said
a voice and it was at that point
that u s deputy marshal forty-
five kicked open the door

  up with yore hands amigos

dont wait to ask me questions

     stick em high or i will mix
       some lead in yore digestions

  for a second or two the despera-
does were too stunned to move
johnny pulled the trigger of one gun
by way of a reminder and the bul-
let tore into the big pan of beans
in the middle of the table the re-
sult was effective every man was
showered with beans

  dont shoot kid squawked one
of the desperadoes and his hands
jerked upward

  one by one they all followed suit
kelso however rose half from his

seat with a bellow like an enraged
bull his hand went in the general
direction of his hip

  br-r-r-rang kelso lurched back-
ward into the far wall as if hit by
a mule his right shoulder was
staved in his arm crippled and dan-
gling

yore under arrest senor kelso

  and no one will shed any tears

   for yore brand-blottin days are all over
   and i hope yuh get forty years

  kelsos face was convulsed with
fury but he knew better than to
try to make any further resistance
caught completely by surprise the

o	bar  gang hadnt fired a shot

  step aside one at a time and un-
buckle yore guns snapped johnny
the rest of yuh keep yore hands
pointed toward high noon ive got
two eyes remember and a gun to
keep each one busy savvy

  the spread savvied completely
and in a few minutes johnny had
disarmed them and had marched
them out toward their own horses

  now ride-and plumb slow and
gentlemanly too the marshal war-
bled

  after johnny met krumm a few
minutes later kelso and clarkson
with their gangs were herded to-
gether for the last time it would
have been hard to say which of the
two rustler chiefs was the angrier

  yuh blasted bungler kelso
snarled at clarkson its yore
fault

  it was yore plan dang yuh
rasped clarkson so shut up

  the little band of prisoners turned
east again and at dusk they were
at the crossroads bar

  im goin to stop here johnny
announced krumm with a grin

  why so

  that mex gal nearly caused me
to get mowed up and i aint forgot
johnny forty-five and the brand blotters



it the fat deputy scowled i aim
to arrest her

  oh i wouldnt do that george
laughed johnny after all she was
only mixed up in this because her
padre was let her go

  no siree announced krumm
as he dismounted shes guilty
too and by golly ill arrest her
father too if hes there

  krumm was gone nearly ten min-
utes while johnny waited patiently
with the prisoners when krumm
finally reappeared he was alone
he mounted his horse without a
word but there was a smile on his
broad face and he sighed deeply

  didnt yuh arrest the senorita
george johnny chuckled as they
trotted on

  nope beamed george yuh
know she was a nice girl after all
i just didnt have the heart she
smiled at me johnny and yuh
should have heard what she said-
told me i was the bravest man shed
ever met and thet she admired me
more than any hombre in utah
ah-h-h-h-h what a gal

  and yuh didnt arrest her father
either johnny grinned

  he wasnt there and i reckon i
wouldnt have arrested him any-
how pore feller

  but ill bet he remembers the
law every time he washes his ears
said johnny solemnly by the
way george what time is it

  the fat deputy fumbled at his
vest and his face went bjank
g-g-g-gone he blurted

  what a gal drawled johnny
forty-five

  twilight was deepening when
they reached the army camp and
herded their sullen prisoners toward
the headquarters building lights
were burning there and they could
see the shadows of the colonel and
the major against the window

blinds they were still walking the
floor

  whos there the colonel barked
as johnny rapped softly

  two deputy marshals and a
bunch o polecats sang out johnny
forty-five

  in astonishment the colonel flung
the door wide the cigar fell from
his mouth when he saw the faces
of the long string of prisoners

  what-whats the meaning of
this gasped colonel shelton

  i think these jaspers have a con-
fession to make drawled johnny
what do yuh say clarkson how
about it kelso

  they hesitated scowling at each
other and then at johnny

  well just forget all about the
dynamite deal johnny reminded
them if yuhll come clean about
the rest of it i think i can get
yuh off with twenty years or so if
yuh do the other way its hangin
kelso turned pale and clarksons
teeth chattered

  ill admit it kelso blurted
we was stealin govment cattle
i reckon the game is up clark-
son nodded

            a lum yates story

  by collins hafford

            author of a landslide fer bar m etc

just a single black speck in the
deep cloudless blue of the sky-
a speck that moved in gradually
narrowing circles just a speck like
a single blemish in an inverted bowl
of bluest crystal

  and because it was the only mov-

ing thing in all the vast dome of
the sky it caught the eyes of the
two slender young riders who were
heading leisurely into the foothills

  thet there ol buzzard has done
sighted himself some supper lum
said zeke olroyd turning in his sad-
dle toward lum yates reckon
mebbe some cow critter up an died
or mebbe a panther dragged it down
an left it lay

  lum yates shook his head slowly
it dont see nothin daid zeke-
jes somethin gettin ready to die
we been watchin thet ol black
scavengeh fo moren an houah an
he aint much nearer the groun
than he was

  yore right lum answered
zeke admiringly id never no-
ticed thet in a year wonder what
it is i dont like buzzards they
always make shivers run up an
down my back

  lum yates grinned slowly a
twinkle in his dark eyes he swung
one long leg over the saddle horn as
he turned toward zeke

  yore kind o superstitious aint
yo zeke buzzards mean death
to yore way of thinkin then the
smile faded from the slender boyish
face an i dont know but what

yore- the slow words stopped

short

  crack faint but unmistakable
came the sound of a rifle shot

  it could be nothing else it came
lobos in paradise valley



from a half mile ahead up in the
more rugged hills

  then as startling as the wicked
sound that had just come to them
was the strange sight that met their
ejes for the circling buzzard far
above them flapped its great wings
desperately-then plunged like a
plummet to the earth

  zeke looked at lum with wide
questioning eyes lum stared back
through narrowed lids as if by an
invisible hand the carefree boyish
look had been wiped suddenly from
lums face

  his long leg swung down from
around the saddle horn he gath-
ered up the reins in his right fist
and touched his blue outlaw horse
snake with his rowels

  reckon yo was right zeke
thet theah buzzard must have
meant death

  zeke swung his runty sorrel
lightnin into the trail beside lum
and as they urged their mounts in
the direction from which the report
came he asked lum a question

  what dyuh figger was the reason
for thet shot lum yuh dont

reckon-

  i dont know son answered the
slim bar m puncher tersely all
were sho of is thet somebody shot
thet theah buzzard mebbe some
waddy killed anotheh-an was
afeared the buzzard would call at-
tention to the dead man

  back on the flat lands these events
would have meant nothing to the
two youngsters they might have
wondered a little at them but up
here in the foothills it was different

  four days ago the two bar m
cowpokes had started for paradise
valley the small thickly grassed
well-watered valley that sandy mc-
clure owned it was well up in the
high country where the men were
as rugged and wild as the hills

  and now only a scant half days
ride from paradise valley they were
alert for any unusual happening
for it had been rumors of trouble
that drifted down from the hills that
caused the old ranchman to send
his two young riders up into the
tumbled mountains

  the rumors had not been definite
-just that everything was not right
in paradise valley and as sandy
had left two men to take care of the
little herd that was to go through
the winter there he thought it best
to investigate

  im sendin yuh an zeke the
old rancher had told lum im
sendin yuh because yore eyes are
keen an yuh got somethin in yore
heads besides bone mebbe there
aint nothin to it-an mebbe there
is all i want yuh to do is to look
aroun keep yore eyes open an
yore fists away from yore guns
for four days there had been no
hint of anything unusual in fact
for the last two days they had not
seen a single person on the trail
then had come the startling report
of a rifle and the tumbling buzzard

  yuh dont reckon its danny
moore or billy adair do yuh
lum asked zeke as they sped
toward the sound of the shot

  i aint even guessin zeke
well know soon enough

  soon they raced up an abrupt
slope they were nearing the place
in fact it should be in sight from
the crest of this slope lum pulled
his blue outlaw horse to a halt and
zeke drew down beside him

  yo stay heah with the hosses
zeke ordered lum crisply im
agoin to slip up to the top an look
aroun aint no use of runnin inter
somethin blind

  he passed his reins to zeke and
swung from his saddle swiftly but
with great caution he made his way


street  smiths wild west weekly

the remaining fifty yards to the
ridge

  here he flattened to the rocky
ground and thrust his head cau-
tiously above the sharp crest for
a long five minutes he lay motion-
less peering down into the valley
beyond

  there was no hint of movement
no sign of the shooter perhaps the
distance was deceptive sound car-
ries far in the thin air of the high
country perhaps the sound of the
report had come from beyond the
next and higher ridge

  he doubled his long legs beneath
him to rise then he flattened sud-
denly again his eyes narrowed and
a gasp hissed from his throat

  for a man had crawled from be-
hind a clump of scrub juniper-
crawled slowly and laboriously the
distance was a full hundred yards
but even that far away lum could
tell that the man was badly hurt

  for another motionless three min-
utes lum kept his gaze on the
crawling form he noted one leg
dragging as if it were broken and
useless he thought he could make
out splotches of dried crimson on
the white face

  then his eyes returned puzzled
to the shapeless black object that
the man dragged by his left hand
as he inched out into the trail

 by jing its- lum slipped

back down the slope leaped to his
feet and raced toward zeke

  without pausing to explain he
swung into his saddle and touched
snake with dulled rowels wide-
eyed zeke followed up over the
ridge and down the other side they
raced

  then lum pulled to a sliding halt
beside the prone form on the
ground the man was motionless
now face down upon the rocky trail
as lum swung from his mount he

took in the sharp-etched details
swiftly he noted the torn clothing
the battered head the twisted leg

  then his gaze shot to the black
object it was as he had thought
-a dead buzzard probably the
very one they had seen drop

  he looks like hes daid zeke
help me well turn him oveh
lums voice was filled with excite-
ment

  together the two slim punchers
rolled the prone body over when
the haggard face was upturned to
the sky zeke leaped to his feet a
gasp coming from his throat

  its-its billy xdair lum billy
-an hes-

  but lum still squatting beside
the twisted form leaned closer he
aint daid zeke his chest is risin
an failin hand me down yore
canteen

ii

 with the big bandanna from
about his throat lum bathed the
pain-twisted face tenderly then he
forced a little water between the
clenched teeth

  with agonizing slowness the
mans eyes opened there was a
wild light in them-a light almost
of insanity and the first words
that came from the dry lips were
meaningless

  billy billy adair lum spoke
slowly and distinctly into the mans
ear billy its lum an zeke
yore hurted billy but well bring
yo out of it

  now the twisted lips writhed and
a mirthless smile split the battered
face

 blast yuh i got yuh yuh
wont circle aroun up in the sky
waitin fer me to croak yuh didnt
think i could shoot huh figgered
i was nigh dead a wild laugh
came from the heaving chest
lobos in paradise valley



  lum looked at zeke zeke re-
turned the stare then lum spoke
in an awed voice

  it was billy shot thet theah buz-
zard zeke thets once a buzzard
misjudged

  now he rose to his feet and looked
about him down to the right about
fifty yards ran a turbulent little
mountain stream it was well hid-
den from the trail by the thick
brush only its sound told of its
presence

  we got to get him away from the
trail zeke said lum an we got
to get out o sight ourselves maybe
some one is follerin-some one thet
plans on finishin the job yo take
his laigs an ill take his haid well
carry him daown to thet crick
when the two young punchers
had forced their way through the
brush with their helpless burden and
laid it tenderly on the lush grass be-
side the ice-cold stream lum
turned to zeke

  yo take ouah hosses zeke
lead em out o sight of the trail
ill try to bring billy to his senses
but zeke was back beside his
companion before billy adair
opened his eyes again and now
lum heaved a sigh of relief for
the mad light had gone only a
pain-stricken weary look shone
from billys red-rimmed eyes

  are yo-are yo feelin betteh
billy can yo talk

  water give me water the
words croaked from billy adairs
parched lips

  after he had drained half of the
contents from lums canteen a wry
smile came to his battered face he
attempted to rise to a sitting posi-
tion but lum restrained him

  dont try to sit up fo a while
billy but ifn yo can talk were
honin to heah whats happened
now a startled look spread across

billys face paradise valley how
far are we from paradise valley
lum

  six-eight miles billy why
an its daytime i must a
been wanderin all night but
danny moores there if he aint
killed they was after him an me
i got away was headin for help
then i fell over the rim of a deep
draw dont remember no more
afteh yo who billy who
lums voice was tense with excite-
ment

  four gun-totin hombres dont
know who they was-except thet
they come a-shootin seemed to be
killin mad because we was in para-
dise valley we holed up in the
cabin until night stood em off
an when dark come we tried to run
for it

  an yo got separated from
danny queried lum swiftly

  danny didnt make it they
come a-tearin in an he jumped
back inter the cabin i heard the
bar of the door drop behind him
then mebbe he stood em off
billy mebbe hes still safe but
we aint got no time to lose

  once more billy adair tried to
sit up but he was still too weak
he groaned as he dropped back to
the grass

  yuh better not try it lum he
grunted his face writhing in pain
theres four of em an theyre
killers we got to have help

  no time fo help billy danny
is all alone an hes needin us yo
stay heah yore safe an well leave
yo grub an wateh well be back
afteh yo in two-three days at the
longest

  now he bent over billy and his
swift fingers examined the useless
leg a sigh of relief came from his
chest as he straightened

  yore laig aint broke billy-jes


street  smiths wild west weekly

sprained an yore pretty bad
bruised but yoll be all right afore
long

  lum turned toward zeke for a
moment his eyes looked squarely
into his partners

  yo aint afeard to haid inter
paradise valley with me zeke he
asked

  the gangly puncher shook his
head i aint afeard lum ill
foller wherever yuh lead

  my rifle lum billy adair put
in i started with it mebbe its
layin aroun somewhere id feel a
heap safer with it dost

  by jing yore right billy an
yo sho know how to use thet rifle
gun even ifn yo are battered up
aint many waddies could bring
daown a flyin buzzard

 huh buzzard there was
wonder and unbelief in billys voice

  yo hunt fo thet rifle zeke
ordered lum

  then he turned to billy in swift
terse words he related the events of
the last hour billy listened with
wondering wide eyes

 but now zeke came crashing
through the brush a rifle over the
crook of his arm he laid it beside
the man on the grass

  there it is billy an its got a
cartridge in it reckon yuh got
more in yore pocket too

  plenty more gritted billy
adair an now yuh two rannies
get goin but dont take no chances
rammin inter them killers yuh
wont do danny no good by gettin
yoreselves killed an if my leg gets
to feelin better ill try to hobble
along after yuh afoot

  well be careful billy an yo
stay right heah well be back afteh

y

  the sun wtas well past the zenith
when lum and zeke swung into
their saddles once more as nearly

as they could judge paradise valley
was six or eight miles away over
the most twisted rocky trail they
had yet traveled

  it would be dusk by the time they
reached the rim of the valley if
they traveled at the best speed their
horses could make but perhaps
that was best after all

  if billy was right-if four lead-
slinging gunmen were down there in
the valley-it would mean sure
death to go charging down in the
light of day

 and if danny moore had held
them off this long darkness would
be a help if he had not-if he was
dead or a captive-an hour or two
more would do no more damage

 who dyuh reckon them four
waddies are lum asked zeke as
they prodded their horses along the
trail

  lum shook his head i aint got
no idea zeke theres a dozen dif-
ferent kinds of bad hombres in these
heah hills theres rustlers an
escaped convicts an killehs an bank
robbehs reckon them fo is plenty
bad

  probably aimin to hole up in
paradise valley for the winter huh
wasnt lookin for billy an danny
to be there wanted paradise val-
ley so bad thet they was willin to
kill a couple of innercent waddies
to get it

  thets my guess grunted lum

  then they gave their whole at-
tention to the trail it twisted
around huge boulders climbed al-
most impossible slopes dropped
down through steep draws and fol-
lowed high-walled canyons

  the sun was sinking below the
jagged ranges to the west when the
two bar m riders arrived at last at
the foot of the abrupt ridge that
marked the eastern rim of paradise
valley beyond it lay the snug al-
lobos in paradise valley



most parklike valley of about a half
mile in circumference

  the sight of this ridge and the
winding trail that led upward
brought a flood of memories to the
two slim cowpokes-happy mem-
ories and many not so happy for
paradise valley had been the scene
of many dangerous events through
which lum and zeke had lived

  yuh remember the first time we
was ever here lum yuh remem-
ber-

  no time for rememberin zeke
grunted lum grimly we got
ouah work cut out fo us or im a
sheep-herdeh i been doin a heap

of thinkin an- he stopped

  an what lum asked zeke
eagerly

  lum shook his head well wait
an see how the lan lays son mebbe
them hombres have gone away
mebbe they give it up as a bad job
but deep in his heart lum knew
that this conclusion was improbable

  once more lum urged his blue
outlaw horse ahead but at the
very foot of the slope he neck-
reined to the left zekes eyes went
wide at this move

 where-where yuh headin
lum he asked in puzzled wonder
aint we goin inter paradise val-
ley

  theres mo ways than one
zeke dont yo remembeh thet
hundred-foot cliff thet hangs square
oveh the cabin dont yo remem-
beh how we slid daown the side of
it one time with ouah ropes

 i remember but-

  ifn them hombres are in the val-
ley therell be some one guardin
the trail broke in lum but they
wont be lookin fo any one to come
daown the cliff

  for a moment zeke was silent
then the logic of lums reasoning
became clear he nodded in ad-

miration but now a puzzled frown
broke across his face

  there aint no way back for us
though once we get down

  we aint goin daown feller-
im goin alone yoll be on top of
the cliff reckon ifn the worst
comes to the worst i can make it
with yore help

 but lum-

  its the only way i can figger
out zeke yo aint goin to be
loafin at thet therell be work
fo yo to do

iii

  but not until they had circled the
valley and approached to the very
rim of the crag that overhung the
cabin did lum make known any
more details of his plan

  they swung from their saddles
ten feet back and slipped to the very
edge of the steep drop here they
squatted on the overhanging rock
and stared down into the gloom of
the valley

 no sound came up to them-no
hint of a living creature below

 do yuh reckon theyve high-

tailed it leavin danny- zeke

did not finish the sentence

 im-im hopin danny aint
daid zeke-hopin them killehs
have high-tailed it an thet danny
is sleepin peaceful daown in the
cabin

  but now a slash of orange light
streaked across the rocky floor of
the valley for an instant then faded
out lum caught his breath in a
sharp gasp

  thet was the door opened zeke
likely theyve got the windows cov-
ered with blankets to shut the light
in kind o lookin fo some one to
jump em most like figured billy
got clean away

  he leaped to his feet and strode
to the horses in a moment he re-


street  smiths wild west weekly

turned two coils of lariat rope in
his hands working swiftly he
knotted them together then he
tied one end tightly to a thick
gnarled tree that was four or five
feet back from the edge

  the other end he let carefully
over the rim of the cliff when the
last of the slack was gone the end
of the rope trailed hardly more than
four feet above the roof of the
cabin

  now lum slipped out of his
sheepskin jacket and thrust it be-
tween the rope and the sharp rock
on the rim that would keep the
rope from sawing apart when his
weight was upon it

  and as he worked he gave his
final instructions to zeke

  ifn i jerk once thet means thet
the killehs have got danny a pris-
oner ifn i jerk twice it means thet
i cant find danny

  an then

  for five minutes lum talked
swiftly zeke listened with a frown
of thought on his brow at each
point he nodded his understanding
but there was a tense set look on
his face for he knew the deadly dan-
ger lum was braving even if every-
thing went as planned

  there was no time to argue how-
ever without another word lum
slipped over the rim carefully to
keep from kicking loose a stone or
even a small pebble he let himself
down the wall of rock an inch at a
time

  to zeke waiting and watching
above it seemed hours before his
hand on the rope told him that lum
had reached the bottom but in
reality hardly more than three min-
utes passed before lums feet
touched softly on the pine-slab roof
of the cabin

  he hesitated for a short breath-
ing spell and to ease the strain on

his arms and as he stood silently
on the roof the murmur of voices
came to him through the chimney
that led up from the stone fireplace
below

  he strained his ears but he could
not make out the words swiftly
he catfooted to the edge of the roof
and let himself down to the ground
only five feet below

  with the stealth of an apache
he circled the long low cabin he
had been right-thick blankets cov-
ered the windows but he remem-
bered a narrow crack in the wall
toward the back on the other side

  like a shadow he made for this
spot his heart skipped a beat
the crack was still there danny
and billy had overlooked it when
they were chinking up the log cabin
for the winter

  he placed his eye to the narrow
opening all of the room was visible
except the corner near him his
gaze swept across from left to right

  he saw the rusty stove in one
corner then the two bunks one
above the other the saddle pegs in
the log wall the sturdy pine-slab
table his eyes stopped there for
now his gaze was riveted on four of
the most hard-bitten ruffians he had
ever looked upon

  the man on the opposite side of
the table facing him was as swarthy
as a half-breed-but no half-breed
was ever so gigantic nor could any
breed boast such a great hooked
nose such shaggy black brows or
such glittering evil eyes

  lum shuddered at the wickedness
in that broad face he pulled his
gaze away with an effort to the man
at the left side of the table he
had only a profile view of this man
but that was enough if the big
man was evil in appearance this
slab-sided lantern-jawed ruffian was
as deadly as a sidewinder

ww-d
lobos in paradise valley



  his pasty face stubble-bearded
and gaunt was shadowed by a great
shock of grizzled-red hair the an-
gular head was set forward on a long
neck like the head of a buzzard
gnarled hairy hands rested on the
table

  the man on the right side of the
table was short and squat with
hardly any neck at all his round
head appeared almost hairless but
as shiny as if it were greased and
an oily grin twisted the thick cruel
lips

  only the back of the fourth man
was visible but the wide shoulders
the hunched-forward head on a thick
neck the ears which thrust out like
the wings of a bat gave him an evil
appearance

  lum pulled his gaze away and ex-
amined the rest of the room-all
but the corner which he could not
see he was looking for another
man-danny but the bar m
puncher was nowhere in sight

  probably killed him or hes man-
aged to get away was the thought
that flicked through lums mind

  for another moment he stood at
the crack in the wall then he
straightened to slip away but he
stiffened suddenly and placed his
ear at the narrow opening for now
the swarthy man was speaking

  im tellin yuh haggard wed
ought ter wipe out thet ranny the
other one got away an hell be
coinin back with help we dont
want no tied-up hombre around as
evidence thet we jumped this here
shack we want to be able to say
we aint seen nothin of nobody-
thet we jest got here

  the lantern-jawed man snarled
his answer and lum shivered at
the wickedness in that voice

  im runnin this show porky
an im tellin yuh thet we aint
goin to do no killin unless we have
ww-d

to i aint hankerin to be sent back
to the big house for murder itd
have been all right to kill em if we
could have got em both at once
yuh be sent back anyway if
yore catched rasped the big man
called porky the minute they
take yuh some onell recognize thet

yore haggard who-

  never mind what i did rasped
haggard i aint no worse off than
the rest of yuh we all escaped to-
gether-an were stickin together
an im boss dont forget thet
now the man whose back was
toward lum spoke in a harsh raspy
voice

  look at thet hombre porky
hes a-layin there takin all this
talk in if we dont wipe him out
hell spill the whole works then
we will be in for it

  lum drew a sharp breath at these
words they must be talking of
danny and the squat man had said
that he was lying there there
he must have meant in the corner
that was beyond lums range of
vision

  danny was safe for a moment
of that much the slim puncher was
sure now but there was no telling
how soon the arguments of the three
would outweigh haggards stubborn
orders there was little time to
waste if lum could read men

  with the speed and stealth of a
panther he stole back into the dark-
ness and circled the house be-
neath the roof at the spot he had
descended he swept the ground with
his fingers and gathered up five or
six rocks about the size of his two
fists

  these he laid softly on the roof
now he scrambled up himself and
stole to the downhanging rope he
clutched it he could feel the twitch
of zekes fingers on it above on the
rim of the cliff


street  smiths wild west weekly

 now lum gave a single sharp
jerk-the signal that danny was a
captive of the killers zeke jerked
his answer lum turned and sped
back to where he had laid the rocks
he gathered them up in his arms
and catfooted to the front of the
roof where it overhung the door

  here he squatted every sense
alert nor did he have to delay
long

  crash fifty yards along the wall
of the cliff a great rock had hurtled
down from above

  silence followed for ten seconds
then lum could hear the thump of
booted feet below him he grasped
a rock in his right hand and waited

  crash another rock came down
from the rim and shattered on the
floor of the valley

  now the door of the cabin swung
open sending a long slash of orange
light across the boulder-strewn
ground

 what is it haggard lum
recognized the voice of the swarthy
ruffian

  probably some wanderin critter
knocked down a rock from the rim
came the rasping answer nothin
to get steamed up about yuh ran-
nies are gettin as trembly as a
schoolmarm

  but at that instant still another
rock crashed to the ground just out-
side the slash of light a hoarse
oath came from the swarthy out-
law

  im goin out there an see whats
makin thet racket haggard he
rasped id a heap rather meet an
hombre out there than stand here in
the light a clean target for him to
plug

  suit yoreself porky snarled the
lantern-jawed haggard but im
tellin yuh re gettin jumpy

  jumpy or not im goin to in-
vestigate growled porky

iv

  lum drew back his arm as the
big outlaw stepped from the door
his keen eyes strained in the dark-
ness as porky slipped outside the
streak of light even in the gloom
the huge shadow was visible

  ten feet-twenty feet-thirty
feet the burly ruffian stole into the
darkness lums long arm swung
with all his force a silent messen-
ger of destruction the rock in his
hand hurtled toward porky

  crack the sound was followed
by a hoarse shriek of pain

  haggard its got me my backs
broke i cant move the mans
yell was wtild and shrill

  yuh thar brummer-hustle out
there an drag him in rasped hag-
gard a note of excitement in his
voice i tol the blasted idiot to
stay in the cabin

  but boss theyll get me too
fear was plain in the round-headed
outlaws voice

  they who are they im tellin
yuh thet them rocks failin is just
an accident get out there an drag
porky in	

 why dont-

  git-unless yuh want a slug in
yore ribs rasped the leader

  slowly cautiously the hairless
man slipped from the door hunched
low his long arms swinging almost
to the ground he made a much
smaller target than porky

  and lums first rock missed him
by inches crashing into the ground
ten feet in front of the outlaw with
a hoarse scream of fright brummer
whirled and raced back

  but already another fist-sized
rock was hurtling toward him and
it caught him squarely on the bridge
of the nose he collapsed with a
gurgling grunt on the rocks just in-
side the slash of light
lobos in paradise valley



  thet wasnt no accident hag-
gard theres some one a-heavin
rocks down from the rim thet
blasted hombre has brought help
fear made the voice of the bat-
eared man high and shrill

 thet rock didnt come from
above rasped haggard now thor-
oughly aroused to the danger
theres somebody down here in the
valley-some one without no guns
or he wouldnt be flingin rocks
well get him

  the door slammed shut wiping
out the streak of light lum drew
back from the edge of the roof be-
low the pound of booted feet came
clearly the two remaining men
were racing toward the back door
above them lum kept pace and
when the door jerked open he was
directly above

  but this time both remaining out-
laws leaped out into the darkness
as if propelled by a catapult lum
lifted his arm to heave another rock
but realized in time that it would
be useless-that it would only serve
to give his position away

  the lantern-jawed leader faded
into the gloom but lum caught the
faint shadow as the man rounded a
boulder to the right the bat-eared
man rounded the house to the left

  lum hesitated only an instant
then he turned and sped across the
roof in the direction taken by the
bat-eared ruffian as he reached
the edge of the roof he could hear
the pound of booted feet out in the
rocks

  like a cat lum dropped to the
ground his arms still filled with the
rocks silent as a shadow he
stalked the outlaw it was easy
for the frightened man made no at-
tempt at silence

  now lum was only ten feet be-
hind the ruffian his right hand held
a jagged rock ready for a second

the outlaw stopped lum could
hear his heaving breath-could see
the shadowy outline against the gray
of the sky

  back went the sinewy arm it
snapped forward with a whistling
sound the rock hurtled straight for
its mark there was a crunch as
it struck then a grunt the shadow
seemed to melt into the ground

  three times lums aim had been
true not wasted had been the
hundreds of times he had hurled
rocks for fun back in the ozarks
when ammunition had been hard to
get now he turned and raced for
the back door of the cabin some-
how he realized that stalking the
lantern-jawed leader would be a
harder job the ruffian haggard
impressed him as a cunning scoun-
drel whom it would be hard to trick

  better free danny moore while
there was time better tackle the
leader when there was help to back
him up he could still hear an oc-
casional sound out in the rocks that
told him haggard still searched for
the mysterious enemy he hoped
that the leader would not give up
too soon

  he breathed a sharp sigh of re-
lief when he reached the door
safely he opened it a crack the
light shone into the back room only
dimly-not enough to catch the eye
of haggard when the door opened
enough to admit lum

  the slim puncher slipped inside
and closed the door softly behind
him now he sped for the front
room inside he blinked twice to
accustom his eyes to the light of the
oil lamp

  then his gaze swept to the cor-
ner it caught the bound form on
the floor two long strides took him
to danny moores side

  quiet danny he breathed as
he stooped over the bar m puncher


street  smiths wild west weekly

haggard is left an he be cornin
back mighty soon weve got to be
quick-an quiet

 with his long-bladed barlow
knife lum slashed the ropes that
bound danny then he lifted the
stiffened puncher to his feet

 rub yore wrists an ankles
danny yo got to be in shape to
run in a hurry we aint got no
time to waste

  wordlessly danny moore obeyed
but hardly had he rubbed the cir-
culation back to one ankle when
the crunch of a booted foot on the
gravel outside warned them that
haggard was returning

  lie daown theah quick or-
dered lum act like yore still tied
up drape them ropes oveh yo
but be ready to help when i call
lums every muscle and nerve
was tensed as he leaped for the door
that led into the kitchen and flat-
tened beside it he waited he
flicked a glance at danny moore
and saw that the puncher was once
more flat upon the floor-and that
the ropes gave the appearance of
bonds

  the back door jerked open and
footsteps sounded on the wooden
floor i didnt find no one link
mebbe we was mistaken after all
yuh better hustle out an drag in
porky an brummer

 apparently the lantern-jawed
leader supposed that the bat-eared
man had returned perhaps he had
even noted the flick of dim light as
the back door had opened to admit
lum

 but the slim bar m puncher
stood silently beside the door then
it swung open to admit the lantern-
jawed haggard lum could have
touched the man by stretching out
his arm to half its reach

  but flattened against the wall as
he was haggard did not see him

the outlaws gaze swept the room
from danny moore to the front
doorl

  huh he grunted perplexed

  he took a single step forward

  and at that instant lum leaped
his hand which still held a rock
went high then crashed down but
some sixth sense must have warned
haggard for the ruffian whirled
and dodged the rock grazed the
mans ear half dazing him

  with a snarling oath the mans
hand streaked for his holster but
lums long leg shot out and caught
the wrist with a crunching bone-
smashing kick

  now the slender puncher hurtled
into the lantern-jawed man like the
blow of a battering-ram both went
down with a crash but lum was
on top his sinewy hands searched
for the ruffians throat

  but haggard was fighting for his
life-fighting like a snarling snap-
ping wolf the mans teeth caught
lums wrist-chewed and ground
upon it lums left fist shot out and
caught the long jaw

  the teeth loosed and the mans
head snapped back to the floor
once more lum groped for the
killers throat and this time he
found it

  danny was now on his feet and
circling the twisting writhing men
on the floor he yelled encourage-
ment to lum but lum scarcely
heard him he was too intent upon
the business at hand

  gradually haggard relaxed his
face was purpling and his eyes were
wide and staring his breath came
in great tortured gasps

  at last lum loosed his hold for
an instant haggard lay quiet
lum got slowly to his feet and
now the reaction came his knees
weak and trembling he slumped
into a chair
lobos in paradise valley



  go-go out an yell to zeke
danny he said breathlessly tell
him to come daown

  huh gasped danny moore
hes up on the cliff tell him
to slide daown the rope feller tell
him its all oveh

  danny moore whirled to obey
and when he returned a few mo-
ments later lum had recovered his
breath and strength

  we betteh get them otheh three
hombres tied up danny they
may be cornin to most any time
swiftly he related to the bar m
puncher the events of the last few
tense minutes

  porky lay on the ground still
writhing from the effects of the
crashing stone in the small of his
back but after he was safely
bound lum examined him and
found no broken bones

  brummer had escaped with less
permanent hurt but the rock as it
struck the back of his head had put
him to sleep for several hours the
third mans face would never look
the same for the rock had broken
his nose and cut a great gash in his
face he too was still unconscious

  when the task of binding the four
ruffians was finished lum turned a
questioning gaze to danny tell
us what happened an who they are
danny

  four hombres thet escaped from
prison lum-from what i could tell
from their talk seems like hag-
gard knew about paradise valley
an planned to hole up here durin
the winter a ramblin puncher told
us a week ago thet they was loose
an warned us they might be headin
this way

 reckon thets how the word
sifted down to the bar m only we
didnt find out anything except thet
things wasnt right here at paradise
valley said lum

  they jumped me an billy con-
tinued danny billy got loose
reckon hes headin for the bar m
right now but me i couldnt make
it an they ketched me reckon
theyd have killed me if yuh hadnt
come lum

 we found billy said lum
hes waitin fo us to come afteh
him kind o bruised up an sore
billy was

 then lum turned to zeke
reckon well be haidin back come
mawnin son but wtell have to
circle some an take this heah pack
of lobos to the sheriff at lamey
id shore like to be goin along
sos i could tell sandy mcclure jest

shorty masters ml d

by allan r bosworth

author of pull yore freight etc

freight bells sent a trium-
phant jingle through the main
street of tarantula a sawed-
off youth so bow-legged that it
looked as if he had been born on a
horse looked up from the sign which
he had just painted and frowned
the sign read

shorty masters m d

  shortys freight outfit was in
the corral that he had built back of
the shack which was to be his trans-
portation headquarters in the little
texas cow town his six mules
were munching oats

  the sign painting had delayed
shortys start for stockton jake

carter rival freighter had stolen a
march on him

  carters covered wagons clattered
near and the burly dirty man
astride the off-wheel horse spat to-
bacco juice through a tangle of
beard and grinned at shorty

  got the drop on yuh again
masters he shouted ill be
loaded and on my way back afore
yuh git started them mules is
slowern christmas molasses

  roll along growled shorty
and keep out o my way

  carter twisted in his saddle and
patted the  strapped to his waist

  dont try ter pass me he
warned if yuh do therell be lead
shorty masters m d



flyin and some dead mules lyin in
the trail fer buzzard bait i dont
eat nobodys dust

  shut up shorty yelled i bet
yuh didnt take time to feed yore
team i wouldnt treat my mules
that a way they can outpull yore
nags on the hills

  carters answer died in the dis-
tance behind a cloud of choking
dust the pecos country was
parched by drought and tarantulas
rival freight outfits were busy haul-
ing hay and cottonseed cake for
ranchers to feed starving cattle
jake carter would beat shorty to
stockton-the rail point-and seize
the choicest load

  hope he runs off into the canyon
at devils drop shorty muttered
mules is like armies- they travel
on their stomachs i reckon the
sextet will forgive me fer crowdin
em later if i let em eat now

  he glanced affectionately toward
the rear of the shack as he nailed
his new sign in place because
shorty had a fondness for classical
music and because the mules were
the offspring of a mare named lucy
he called his outfit the sextet from
lucia and gave each animal the
name of a famous composer

  there were mendelssohn tschai-
kowsky rubinstein beethoven
mozart and chopin-all con-
tentedly eating and switching away
the flies in the early-morning sun

 anyway shorty muttered
this sign will bring us more busi-
ness and well show carter
whether hosses is bettern mules
he stepped into the street and
stood with hands on hips proudly
looking at his work the sign added
a professional touch

  a clatter of hoofs startled him
he whirled to see a light wagon ca-
reen along the street and lurch to a
stop in front of his place two

horses stood drooping in their tracks
heaving and tired a woman sprang
to the ground and dashed up the
rickety steps to shortys office

  the little freighter stepped up re-
moving his battered stetson

 mornin maam he said
could i dosomethin fer yuh
she turned to face him and he
saw she was pale and weary with
little streaks of dust along her
cheeks that told of tears she
pushed her sunbonnet back with
thin nervous hands shorty heard
a gasping cry from the wagon

  the doctor said the woman
my babys sick im afraid-
afraid its diphtheria

  her voice broke over the last
shorty paled ad twisted his hat in
his hands

  there aint any doctor in taran-
tula maam he stammered yuh
see that m d on my sign stands
fer mule driver i thought i was

doin somethin smart but-

  another strangled wail came from
the wagon the mother turned back
down the steps her drawn face a
little whiter

  oh she gasped no doctor
poor little bobby what on earth
can i do

  shorty thought with desperate
swiftness the nearest doctor was
at stockton-twenty miles away-
an all-day trip for his mules horses
could make it more quickly but the
womans team was spent and the
little freighter knew of no other team
available it was up to him and the
sextet from lucia

 we was goin ter stockton
maam turn yore hosses inter the
corral and ill hitch the mules my
wagons are empty and i reckon we
can put on some extry speed my
names shorty masters

  im mrs wilson-mrs bob wil-
son said the woman weve got


street  smiths wild west weekly

a little ranch down on howard draw
my husband is away with some beef
steers little bobby took sick two
days ago

  well its goin ter be all right
maam me and my mules will git
the baby ter stockton pronto yuh
can climb inter the first wagon with
the baby hey chopin mozart
look lively yuh long-eared over-
grown jack rabbits we got a job

ii

  the sextet from lucia swung out
of tarantula on the run with shorty
masters m d considerably on the
the prod he trotted alongside the
wheelers cracking his twenty-five-
foot mule whip over their ears

  the anxious woman sat nervously
on the edge of the wagon seat
little bobby was just behind made
comfortable with a roll of bedding

  pull yuh loafers roared shorty
dig yore feet in the sand

  the mules bent every ounce of
effort into their traces ahead of
them stretched the divide grade a
long winding climb halfway to its
top crawled a dun caterpillar frowsy
with swirling dusty that would be
jake carter who had the drop on
shorty with a stare for stockton

  crack the whip uncoiled its
swift length and snapped savagely
within an inch of mozarts head

  the red mule ducked and doubled
its efforts

  carters outfit was slow on the
grades it was shortys chance to
gain on him the little teamster
knew his rival would not tire out his
team in an out-and-out race but he
would never allow shorty to pass
the mule driver remembered the
threat of lead flyin and some dead
mules in the trail

  ruts in the road were worn deep
by cutting wheels and last winters

rains the chance of getting past
carter was slim mesquites on the
divide would prevent shorty from
pulling out of the road and passing
the other outfit even if his mules
could show the required speed

  he set his jaw grimly and tight-
ened the cartridge belt another
notch to keep the  from banging
against his leg freighting was sup-
posed to be a peaceful business but
shorty had never found it so

  fishing in his pocket the little
teamster produced his beloved har-
monica and grinned reassuringly at
mrs wilson as he broke into a stir-
ring march theyd make it some-
how-they had to get to a doctor

  the mules seemed to understand
that a life was at stake they
pulled as they had never done be-
fore and struck the lower portion of
the divide at a gallop

  shorty was breathless before a
hundred yards of the climb had been
covered he cracked the whip again
put his harmonica away and sprang
to the seat beside the woman

  dont yuh fret he told her
well git there in two shakes of a
mules tail theres a varmint in the
road ahead of us that allows i aint
goin ter pass him and i dont
reckon hed let us by even if he
knew about the baby but when
we git up behind him i want yuh
to git over back of the seat with
the youngster and keep down low
there might be some shootin
oh the woman gasped you
mustnt risk your life for us

  shucks maam said shorty
masters its kind of a game be-
tween me and jake carter-seein
who can git ter stockton first well
be on the divide by the time we
catches up with him and i reckon i
aint goin ter eat his dust

  the sick child cried weakly and
mrs wilson needed no further urg-
shorty masters m d



ing she climbed over the seat and
knelt beside him on the swaying
wagon bed shorty breathed a sigh
of relief

  the mules swung around a turn on
the grade beginning to blow hard
with tlieir exertion shorty saw
jake carters outfit ahead and
above by the time they made the
top his mules would almost have
their noses in carters chuck box

  it gave him an idea if he could
get that close to carters wagons it
would be difficult for the burly
freighter to shoot carter would
have to fire back through the wag-
ons themselves and the sheets were
drawn tight leaving a very small
opening

  giddap mules ordered the
little freighter well be hangin on
his tail all the way acrost the divide
if yuh do yore best then when we
go down devils drop mebbe i can
pass him

  carters wagons veered almost
broadside to him on another turn
above shorty saw the bearded man
still astride the off wheeler lifting a
flask high carter was drinking as
usual hed be in an ugly mood

  the driver ahead flung the emp-
tied bottle aside wdth an oath
shorty saw his hand whip down and
then up with the sun glinting on
blue steel shooting already

  the little freighter ducked as lead
spatted through the taut wagon
sheet just behind him the gun
roared from the heights and set
echoes thundering

  shorty cast an apprehensive
glance behind him and was reas-
sured mrs wilson forced a smile
through pale lips as she huddled
over the baby shielding him from a
possible bullet

  boom carters  again sent
lead whining over their heads

  it was hard for the other freighter

to shoot downward without aiming
too high

  the mules were swinging around
the turn that carter had passed a
moment before shorty heard oaths
from the half-drunken teamster
above and a wave of hot rage surged
through the little mule driver he
drewt his own gun and turned it up
toward jake carter

  boom another shot came from
the winding road above before
shorty had a chance to pull trigger

  there was a clanging noise a
shock in his gun hand and the 
went flying from his grasp-over the
canyon rim

  one shot in a thousand and car-
ter had made it by pure luck now
shorty masters was unarmed listen-
ing to jakes roaring guffaws

  mrs wilson straightened in
alarm saw that shorty was unhurt
and knelt by the crying baby again

  that was a lucky shot fer him
shorty gritted but i reckon
theres other things besides guns i
used to didnt pack none and i got
along ill beat that hombre to
stockton or make him go so fast he
wont be in our way a-tall

iii

                                       

  jake carters outfit disappeared
over the divide rim and picked up
speed on the level stretch where the
deep-rutted road cut a straight and
narrow path through scrub mes-
quite sachuista and cats-claw
dust swirled behind his wagons and
settled on the backs of the sextet
from lucia as they topped the rise

  shorty jerked the long whip into
an explosion that burst over the
leaders heads

  lay yore bellies in the sand
mules he shouted we jest got
started in this race yuh wouldnt
let a lot of mangy ring-boned wind-


street  smiths wild west weekly

spavined buzzard baits beat yuh to
stockton would yuh

  mozart strained into the traces
with a snort of disgust chopin
backed his black ears wickedly and
lunged across the wagon tongue to
nip at rubinstein the freight out-
fit took on a burst of speed

  shorty grinned as he licked dry
dust-chapped lips his mules under-
stood maybe they wouldnt beat
jake carter to stockton-probably
carter would get the pick of the
freight but theyd not be delayed
if the outfit ahead kept up its pace

  a third of the seven-mile level
stretch crawled by the freight wag-
ons little bobby slept fitfully on
his swaying bed and even his
mother worn with weariness dozed
shorty could hear faint shouts and
oaths from the teamster ahead

  the sun was high and hot they
passed buckhorn sink where there
should have been water and found
only a dry sun-cracked mud bed
white with alkali deposits and then
shorty masters looked up to see that
carters horses were lagging

  the sextet from lucia plodding
steadily ahead cut down the dis-
tance between the two outfits a
quarter of a mile-a fifth-three
hundred yards-a hundred yards

  thats what he gits fer not feed-
in his team shorty observed aloud
thought hed be stoppin fer lunch
but with me crowdin him he aint
had a chance nope hosses aint
got the endurance of my mules
dust swirled back from carters
outfit and fell in a gray cloud over
the following wagons mrs wilson
coughed and awoke from her doze
then the babys tortured strangling
cough was heard

  shorty turned to the mother
wet yore handkerchief in the water
keg back there maam and put it
over the little fellers face he said

were crowdin the varmint thats
tryin to hold us up and i reckon
well pass him or bust

  he ducked instinctively as a gun
cracked from the wagons ahead
the bullet whined harmlessly past
he saw carters bearded face framed
in the canvas opening just above the
chuck box that hung on the rear
wagon

  bang shortys stetson whipped
off his head to fall beneath the
wheels and be ground deep in the
dirt the little freighter set his jaw

  ill git that hombre he gritted
mebbe hes got the drop on me
now but ill show him

  a third shot roared over the di-
vide the bullet struck the steel
tire on the left front wheel and
screamed fiendishly away into space

  shorty cupped his hands like a
megaphone and yelled at carter

  stop yore shootin jake and let
me by i got a woman and a sick
baby here-takin em to the doc-
tor

  carters drunken laugh cgme roll-
ing back over the jingle of lead bells
and the creak of harness

  ill see yuh dead afore yuh
passes me he shouted take
this

  this was another crack from his
 the wagon sheet above mrs
wilsons head ripped for a space of
two feet as if slit by a knife

  shorty growled under his breath
it was a good thing the lurching
wagon added to the unsteadiness of
carters aim

  the mules slowed to a walk a
hundred yards behind the horse-
drawn outfit carters wagons were
crawling now with no hand on the
reins at this rate it would be past
nightfall before they hit stockton

  shorty watched in vain for an
opening in the mesquite and cats-
claw where he could turn out of the
shorty masters m d



deep-rutted road and pass jake car-
ter scub trees gnarled and twisted
by winter winds grew everywhere
drooping listlessly in the heat of
noon little bobby was crying
weakly-sounded worse than he had
at any time during the morning

  dont worry mrs wilson
shorty assured the mother ill git
by the coyote somehow if i hadrvt
lost my gun-

  he looked up to see jake carter
scrambling forward to his lead
wagon beyond were the hills that
rimmed the lipan flats

  they were coming to devils drop
-that dangerous descent from the
divide to the valley floor and from
the bottom of the hill on into stock-
ton there wouldnt be another
chance to pass carter

  shorty drew a sharp breath by
some miracle he might be able to
squeeze his galloping mules past
carter on the down grade but only
a miracle could save his outfit from
crashing over the canyon rim to
death and destruction if he allowed
the sextet a free rein on the treach-
erous turns of devils drop

iii

  the little freighter called up a
mental picture of the hill where the
road doubled back on itself to lessen
the angle of descent he heard the
screech of brakes against smooth
tires carter was already on the
downgrade his lead wagon crowd-
ing the wheelers

  an idea born of desperation took
shape in shortys mind carter had
the drop on him-carter the
drunken ruffian who knew no pity
for a sick child or its anxious mother
there was only one way out

  he turned to mrs wilson again
his face a little pale under the tan
but his voice steady and confident

  i wish youd climb up on the seat
and handle these long-eared jack
rabbits fer me he said ill set
the brake and all yuh got to do is
keep em pulled over huggin the
inside wall chopin gits plumb
careless tryin to admire the scenery
down in the canyon and one of these
days hes goin ter make a misstep
and the buzzards will git him

 the woman nodded where are
you going she asked

  to git the drop on jake carter
shorty gritted hed do the same
thing fer us if we was ahead of him
and didnt want him ter pass dont
yuh worry none jest let the outfit
ease down grade and keep chopin
away from the scenery

  they struck the first twisting de-
cline of devils drop shorty
grabbed the brake handle and set it
well forward then sprang back to fill
the drip cans with water

  there was no use burning up the
shoes that grated against the wagon
tires jake carters sounded now
like the wail of a lost soul

  shorty looked ahead carters
outfit had made the first turn and
was doubling back below in a hairpin
turn a few more minutes and hed
be passing just beneath the spot
where the sextet were guardedly
coming down

  ill be waitin fer yuh down the
road a ways shorty told the
woman dont let chopin admire
the scenery now

  he leaped lightly to the ground
his second and third wagons rolled
by almost brushing him over the
edge of the canyon

 shorty remembered one day
when he had met the stage on dev-
ils drop the lighter vehicle had
been forced to back two hundred
yards behind terrified horses until
it reached a wide spot and could
turn out


street  smiths wild west weekly

  here he comes the little team-
ster muttered i reckon if i fail
the lady can still git ter stockton as
quick as if i was handlin the
mules shes got spunk that woman
has

  he looked down past the narrow
shelf that was the road into the
dizzy depths of the canyon if he
failed hed be bait for buzzards
somewhere down there on the jagged
rocks

  he drew a long breath and began
a cautious climb down the canyon
wall clutching at bushes and out-
croppings of rock it was fifty feet
down to where the road doubled
back beneath him twenty-five
feet of this was a sheer drop blasted
away from the hillside

  cactus and spanish dagger tore
at his clothing and pricked his flesh
as if trying to hold him back once
he slipped and nearly fell but he
grabbed a rough ledge with one hand
and held on until his feet found
safety again then he made the
edge of the cliff and crouched in
the shelter of a cats-claw waiting

  jake carters freight outfit came
lumbering down the grade crawling
cautiously taking what seemed an
eternity to arrive the burly
bearded man swayed on the seat
bellowing an old range song in a
tuneless basso

as i was out walkin the street of
     laredo-

the streets of laredo one very fine
     day-

  shorty knew the rest of it-about
the young cowboy all dressed in his
grave clothes he shuddered slightly
as the lead horses swung below him
their bells tinkling musically

  now the wheelers were going by
then jake himself looking broad-
shouldered and squat from above
with a pearl-handled  glistening
through the rising dust cloud

  the little mule driver gathered his
muscles now was the time-now
with the taut canvas of the first
wagon just below him

  he leaped suddenly twisting his
body like a cat in the air throwing
arms and legs wide he shot down-
ward through the intervening space
praying that he could find a hold on
the wagon sheet praying that the
bows would break and stop his fall
and not bounce him over into the
dizzy canyon

  shorty struck the smooth wagon
cover with a sharp smack the two
forward bows splintered under the
impact and sent him rolling toward
the seat-a clutching scrambling
ball of fury he heard a startled
yell from jake carter then one
wildly grabbing hand caught the
burly driver and held

  the big teamster twisted in his
seat to meet the attacker who had
leaped upon him like a panther
shorty jerked himself to his knees
and slammed a quick short jab to
carters face

  he heard the bearded man grunt
and then a back-handed slap from
carter almost knocked the little
mule driver from the wagon

  they fought silently twisting
raining sort vicious blows carter
dropped his reins and grabbed at his
gun shorty seized the thick wrist
with one hand and held it desper-
ately pounding carter in the face
and neck struggling to pull him back
over the wagon seat

  the gun came out despite his sav-
age efforts to hold jakes arm car-
ter was twisting around trying to
bring it into play jabbing it at
shortys body

  yuh sawed-off runt snarled the
big driver ill learn yuh-

  screeching brakes and jingling
bells drowned the rest of his threat
shorty masters using his last des-
shorty masters vl d



perate ounce of strength forced his
crooked left arm upward and hooked
it around carters throat

  he kicked out desperately for a
foothold to brace his straining body
he found something with his right
boot and shoved with all his might

  the screeching ceased abruptly
jake carters wagons leaped forward
on the steep grade lurching sway-
ing the  spat flame and seared
shortys cheek with powder as he
clung grimly to the hairy neck

  carter gasped he was trying to
choke out a warning that the reins
had dropped down over the wagon
tongue that the brake lever had
been released by that kick from
shortys boot

  the wagons lurched down grade
with increasing speed clattering
crowding the wheelers the horses
snorted with fear setting back des-
perately against the run-away load

  shorty looked up to see the can-
yon wall racing by on one side on
the other was the almost straight-
up-and-down cliff of devils drop
with jess than a two-foot margin of
safety

  the little freighter half straight-
ened twisted at carters gun hand
and released his grasp to shoot a
smashing jab at the big mans chin
then he jerked erect and leaped

  shorty landed on his feet against
the canyon wall and nearly fell un-
der the whirring wheels of the two
rear wagons as they shot past he
heard a scream of terror from jake
carter saw the wagons veer on the
turn that was just ahead then the
wheels struck the edge of the cliff
and slipped over

  there was a resounding crash of
splintered timber rolling down
devils drop another scream came
from jake carter and then the clat-
ter died in the depths where the
wreckage smashed on the rocks

  shorty swayed gasping for air
with tortured lungs the dust cloud
settled and all was silent in the can-
yon up around the turn came the
sextet from lucia with mrs wilson
keeping chopin well away from the
rim from which he liked to admire
scenery

  bait fer buzzards shorty mut-
tered

v

  the sextet from lucia sweating
and tired trotted into stockton to
the triumphant jingle of freight bells
and a stirring tune from shorty
masters harmonica five minutes
later little bobby wilson was in a
cool bed with dr carroll bending
over him

  shorty and the anxipus mother
crowded close but it was the little
teamster who first found his voice

  how is he doc he asked with a
sort of choking in his words

  the physician turned and patted
shortys dust-covered shoulder

  there there son he said
your baby will be all right you
got him here just in time dont
worry-but you will of course i
know how fathers are

  yuh-yuh got m-me wrong
shorty stammered with a blush
its the ladys baby not mine i
aint married doc i got all i kin
do ter take care of a family of long-
eared mules i reckon ill be goin
out and seein how they are

  he escaped before mrs wilson
could sob her thanks the sextet
from lucia raised six tired heads to
look at their owner

  shucks shorty told them i
plumb hate ter drive yuh like that
but i guess yuh know how it was
anyway we dont eat nobodys

heehawed triumphant agreement
the marshal from
fort davis

by kent bennett

author of the avenging shadow etc

the night was very young
when big bill stoudenmayer
made his first appearance in
franklin and there was nothing in
the sky to foretell the eventfulness
of his coming which was so to
change the place that it would never
be the same again

 stoudenmayer was not a hard
hombre to describe any one could
just say he was a bull of a man and
let it go at that this sounds too
simple and easy but it really fitted
for he had the look of that animal
and its manner and the splendid
stubbornness it displays in the ring

  as stoudenmayer walked along el

paso street he did not attract un-
due attention his twin s in
well-worn holsters hanging heavy at
his thick thighs suggested that he
was just another gunman and
such hombres were too common a
sight to be remarkable the supply
of them was more than ample in the
roaring boom town

  flaring gas lamps glared in the
dingy single-story adobe buildings
fronted by broad arched portals
for blocks the west side of the
street was lined with a solid row of
variety theaters dance halls sa-
loons and gambling houses

  until dawn the bright lights of
the marshal from fort davis



 these places of pleasure would
 beckon invitingly to a population
 which had jumped to three thousand
 with the coming of the front camps
 of the texas pacific and the atchin-
 son topeka and santa fe rail-
 roads

   but bill stoudenmayer passed by
 all these opportunities for refresh-
 ment and entertainment this night
 he was a man with a single purpose
 and he made his way with direct
 steps to the chamber of the com-
 mon council assembled in regular
 session

   there he found the handful of
 men who had been chosen to rule
 the town-and whose lot was the
 unhappiest of any in it the com-
 bing of the railroads had given them
 a raw deal and they were trying to
 play out hopeless hands

   the little group was transacting
 routine business when stouden-
 mayer entered the room shifting in
 their chairs about a scuffed table
 they glanced at him speculatively

   no particular welcome for the
 newcomer appeared on the faces of
 the mayor and councilmen they
 bore the look of men who had con-
 fronted the unpleasant for so long
 that they had ceased to expect any-
 thing else

   bill stoudenmayer bluff and un-
 abashed returned their glum regard
 with a pair of steady eyes his
 hands gave a hitch to his gun belt
 as he waited for an invitation to
 speak

   the mayor leaned forward in his
 chair

   whats your business with the
 council stranger

   well gentlemen stoudenmayer
 spoke with blunt directness i
 heard youd failed to find a marshal
 who could hold the town down so
 i lowed id like to try the job if
 youd make it worth a mans while

  his hearers glanced at one an-
other with no noticeable enthusiasm
then stared back at the big stranger
the mayor cleared his throat strok-
ing his chin thoughtfully

  and who he asked do you
happen to be if you dont mind tell-
ing

  bill stoudenmayer from fort
davis

  none of the group appeared at all
affected as he disclosed his identity
the name meant nothing to them
there were no legends concerning
its possessor

  hm-m-m snorted one of the
council and youve heard things
eh he inquired dryly but you
couldnt a heard much or you
wouldnt be applying here for an of-
ficers star

  its plenty ive heard all right
replied bill stoudenmayer about
holdups and killings and that it
aint safe for respectable peoples to
be out nights unless they walk by
the middle of the street with their
guns in their hands

  thats a little of it admitted
the councilman twisting a gray
mustache but about all the law-
men weve hired-marshals and
deputies-maybe youve heard
about them too one-day men
they been called and some of them
didnt last that long

  yeah stoudenmayer nodded
shortly thats why i think maybe
i can make a deal with you gentle-
men

  several of his listeners gave re-
signed shrugs as stoudenmayers
characteristic stubbornness began to
make itself felt they looked at
their presiding officer after a
slight hesitation he again addressed
the big german

  stranger just what is your idea
what are you figuring on

  well said stoudenmayer im


street  smiths wild west weekly

hoping to make some good money
for myself-and to save the city
more heres my proposition gen-
tlemen

  if youll pay me five hundred a
month you can discharge all your
deputies and ill go it alone and
guarantee to clear the town of
toughs or draw no pay hows that
sound to you

  the entire group stared at him in
amazement the wild audacity of
his proposal seemed to have robbed
them of speech for a moment
there was a complete and paralyzing
silence in the council chamber

  finally several stirred in their
chairs the mayor pulled out a
handkerchief and wiped his shining
forehead

  man he exclaimed do you
know this town at all you dont
talk like it

  i havent been around yet ad-
mitted stoudenmayer i wanted to
come here first but i lowed to size
things up to-night-after we come
to an agreement

  oh gasped the mayor oh
you did eh

  yeah continued stoudenmayer
i plan to circulate around quietlike
and get a line on all the hombres
that needs to be got rid of-all the
worst ones anyways i aim to settle
the big fish first then the pikers and
four-flushers wont be no trouble
such sublime confidence was be-
yond the imaginations of the har-
assed officials it could be accounted
for only by the mans confessed ig-
norance of conditions a bored look
appeared on the faces of several as
if they felt that he was taking up
their time to no good purpose

  i reckon you dont know what
youd be up against-what weve
been up against these past months
the mayor told stoudenmayer pa-
tiently

  maybe you was figuring on hav-
ing a big posse to back you up in a
clean-up put in a mild-looking
member of the council if so you
got another guess coming stranger
thats done been tried-and got no-
where

  yeah said the mayor we had
a vigilante gathering in front of the
grand central hotel one night
wasnt but thirty or so dared to
show up and they had to face a
crowd of a couple hundred crooks
and killers the whole bunch was
ready for a battle right in the
plaza

 and what happened then
asked stoudenmayer

  what could a handful of vigi-
lantes do against a mob like that
theyd a been massacred if theyd
started anything

  muh grunted bill stouden-
mayer no wonder the sidewinders
are chesty getting away with a thing
like that his eyes narrowed and
the muscles of his outthrust jaw
tightened

  no gentlemen i wasnt count-
ing on any posse just give me a
chance to do the job alone-thats
all i ask

  the councilman with the droop-
ing gray mustache shook his head
vigorously

  itd be plumb foolish it couldnt
be done with lessn two or three
troops of regulars

  several of his fellow members
nodded agreement

  stoudenmayer looked from one to
another of the councilmen his
coarse brutal features were set in
stubborn lines and his eyes held a
hint of scorn impatience edged his
voice as he burst out almost plead-
ing

  gentlemen what have you got
to lose seems to me im the one
thatll be taking the risks if im

ww-d
the marshal from fort davis



willing why dont you give me a
shot at it im the hombre thatll
collect the damage if any it wont

be you-

  oh wont it interrupted the
gray-mustached councilman why
stranger those killers have threat-
ened to wipe out this council to a
man if we try to make another
move against em

  talks cheap the big ger-
mans face darkened a shade
youd find it dont assay much to
the ton if youd try a large dose of
action on that crowd and thats
what im craving to do gentlemen
he paused and eyed them still hope-
ful

  several of his listeners met his
sharp direct glance on their faces
was a reflection of his own fiery
eagerness at last they were aroused
from their apathy stirred by the
brute force of the man from fort
davis could he possibly make
good where all the others had
failed

  i move we hire him one mem-
ber voiced a new-found courage
lets take a vote on it

  heads drew together around the
council table and there was a buzz
of lively whispered conversations
stoudenmayer withdrew to the edge
of the room leaning against the
wall he rolled a cigarette and
lighted it with patience he waited
until the councils decision finally
came in the mayors raised voice
gentlemen he gets a star

ii

  citizens who were astir at day-
break were the first to discover what
appeared to be some ones weird idea
of a town joke the rising sun found
groups of them clustered about sev-
eral spots between oregon street
and the plaza

 ww-d

  the magnets of their interest were
conspicuously posted notices writ-
ten in a crude hand-notices that
were brief and to the point

   any of the holdups named below i find in
town after three oclock to-day im going
to kill on sight

  there followed a list of seventy
names a list that was carefully
chosen and complete it included
only the seasoned crooks and toughs
of the town hardly a man was
named whose dark record was not
publicly known

  each notice bore the same rude
signature

  bill stoudenmayer city mar-
shal

  a few there were who read their
own names on the outlaws roster-
read and laughed but it was an
early hour for most of the boss lobos
as yet not many were stirring later
when they were aroused would come
the cream of the jest

  others there were too who read
the homemade placards and shook
their heads these were solid sub-
stantial citizens of the town men
who respected law and order yet
they shook their heads in the half-
pitying fashion men will over an
hombre gone loco and doomed to de-
struction

  and bets were offered-for there
are men who will bet on anything-
wagers that the strange marshal
would not last till noon but they
found few takers and these de-
manded odds of ten to one

  yet throughout the long morning
bill stoudenmayer quietly walked
the streets he made his way alone
supported only by the six-guns at his
waist and the gleaming silver star on
his coat

  he appeared heedless of the stares
directed at him unconcerned by the
growing tensity which charged the


street  smiths wild west weekly

sluggish air but not even the stir-
ring of a leaf eluded his watchful
eyes

  noon came then one oclock two
oclock

  on the northeast corner of el
paso and san antonio streets there
stood a cottonwood that was an eye-
filling sight for any one who appre-
ciates an upstanding tree such was
its girth that you could almost hide
a horse behind it a man two men
even could be entirely concealed by
its bulk

 when stoudenmayer approach-
ing from the opposite side of the
street drew near the big tree two
men were in ambush there one of
them gripped a shotgun holding it
upright so that the barrel might not
extend beyond the shelter of the cot-
tonwood

  the steps of the big german came
closer he was walking at his usual
steady deliberate pace

  the man with the shotgun slowly
edged around from in back of the
tree his companion pressed close
behind him one hand at his holster

  in an instant the bulky figure of
stoudenmayer came within their
line of vision but at the same time
the new marshal saw the two killers
just as they started to throw down
on him his hands shifted in a blur
of motion

  the shotgun reached its owners
shoulder as his companion spring-
ing out from behind him drew the
six-gun at his own belt

  but guns seemingly had leaped
into both of stoudenmayers hands
and their muzzles spat yellow flames

 cr-rash bang from the new
marshals s twin roars of death
shattered the atmosphere

  the terrific impact of a lead slug
staggered the man with the shotgun
while his finger was seeking the trig-
ger of his weapon another bullet

crashed into him as he swayed on
his feet with a scream he pitched
forward on his face in the dust of
the street

  the other killer fired one wild
shot then he slumped to the
ground like a dropped sack the
fingers tightened about his revolver
remained rigid still flying lead
had found his heart

  as the acrid powder smoke cleared
away stoudenmayer reloaded his
guns a glance at the prostrate
bodies of his attackers was sufficient
to tell that their crimson trail was
run out

  quietly the big german skirted
the prone figures with a slowness
that belied his deadly six-gun speed
he continued on his walk

  when he came to one of the no-
tices he had posted along el paso
street he stopped and crossed off
two names

iii

  there was something about the
gun play at the cottonwood that
laid hold of the imagination of the
town the news of it sped through
the streets growing as it went re-
port had increased the casualty list
to six by the time the tale had trav-
eled that many blocks

  the joke of the locoed stranger
appeared to have teeth in it

  perhaps the city council in be-
stowing a new star had something
up its sleeve and this little skirmish
was the unbuttoning of the cuff so
to speak

  even the witnesses and near-
witnesses to the affray were unde-
niably impressed two to one were
not such great odds of course but
when the two lay in wait and the
one was surprised-that lengthened
chances considerably it was agreed
that the new marshal had done a
workmanlike job
the marshal from fort davis



  so the betting shifted until even
money was offered that the marshal
from fort davis would last out the
day

  meanwhile big bill stoudenmayer
continued his one-man patrol for law
and order his narrowed eyes alert
for the possible appearance of foes
he paced the principal street of the
town he looked very much like a
bull circling a ring with nowhere
the flash of a red cape to stir it to
action

  three oclock came and passed
the time limit of his ultimatum to
the gunmen had expired he had
given them fair warning now it
would be a kill on sight no
quarter would be given or asked

  yet that sight was denied him

  finally he forsook his lone street
parade and for the last hours of
the waning afternoon he methodi-
cally visited the saloons and gaming
houses which crowded the west side
of the thoroughfare

  but there was a strange and con-
spicuous absence of bad men from
all the places of pleasure the night
before they had been as thick as
mosquitos in a swamp now not a
one was to be found in any public
spot

  evidently none of the town killers
was eager to face the new marshal
singly as stoudenmayer made his
futile search his lips set in a grim
smile it was a smile with more
than a hint of a sneer

  and yet the hiding of all these
gunmen was blackly ominous for
doubtless it meant that they were
engaged with secret plans for the
destruction of the foolhardy hombre
who dared to post his defiance of the
whole pack

  too long the town had been in the
hollow of their hands-a soft-shelled
nut with sweet kernels to be picked
one locoed lawman couldnt be al-

lowed to whisk it away from them
now

  even the respectable citizens could
see but one ending to the affair
true the cottonwood affray had im-
pressed them for the moment yet
sober second thought reminded them
that that had disposed of only two
bad men sixty-eight were left ac-
cording to bill stoudenmayers own
conservative reckoning

  what could one man no matter
how fearless do against such over-
whelming adds

  there was but one answer of
course any one could tell that
without looking in the back of the
book

  for some unknown reason this big
stranger had chosen to commit sui-
cide-you couldnt call it anything
else and although the sight of him
on his deliberate patrol drew admir-
ing glances it didnt get him the
backing of a single friendly gun

  but this to be sure didnt matter
to stoudenmayer he had all he
wanted-the silver star of office
and as the sun went dowrn he
w aited to play out his hand heedless
of how the deck was stacked against
him

  in the last moments of twilight
he was standing on the east side of
el paso street approaching dark-
ness was throwing shadows about
the low buildings of adobe from
which shone the yellow gleam of oil
lamps

  with characteristic disregard for
his own safety he had stopped in an
exposed spot he was in the mid-
dle of the block with no protecting
shelter in close reach

  on the opposite side of the street
shadows were deepening behind the
columns of the arched portals-
shadows that concealed lurking fig-
ures

  the wolf pack had gathered for


street  smiths wild west weekly

the kill and here was its prey in
the open there might never be a
better chance

  suddenly there was a flash of
gunfire in the gathering darkness
and the shattering report of a 
an eager killer had hurled lead at
the bulky target of the new lawman

  as if the shot were a signal a
heavy fusillade was directed at
stoudenmayer from the opposite
side of the street

  in a deafening crescendo a hun-
dred guns flamed in a volley at their
lone enemy

  but the big german in some mi-
raculous fashion was not even hit
his s were in his hands and he
stepped forward firing with wonder-
ful accuracy and rapidity into the
ranks of the massed killers of the
town

  uncanny indeed was his survival
of that first volley-and terrifying
his unhesitating advance

  heedless of the leaden hail that
swept about him he came on slowly
and steadily not wasting a shot
the bullets from his blazing guns
dropped one desperado after an-
other their groans and oaths min-
gled with the roar of snarling s

 the eyes of the new marshal
gleamed in the dusk with a yellow-
ish fire his brutal face was set in
savage killer lines bullets tugged
at his clothing one knocked his tall
stetson from his head

  still he advanced in the open
picking of his enemies who vainly
kept as close as possible behind the
shelter of the porch columns with
frantic haste they fired at the terri-
ble death-dealing figure of the big
german

  yet lie never staggered never wa-
vered as at every second his mark-
manship cut down one of the outlaw
band

  the storm of lead abruptly light-

ened as some of the bad men stam-
peded in terror such nerve and
shooting was too much for them

 by the time stoudenmayer was
halfway across the street the panic
had seized all of the surviving killers
of the town ceasing their firing
they ran in frantic flight they dis-
appeared into the shadowed side
streets

  when the clouds of gun smoke had
lifted they were gone citizens ap-
proaching cautiously toward the
scene saw the huge figure of the
new town marshal standing alone
stretched on the sidewalk ahead of
him were nine desperadoes who had
stopped lead from his s only
two of them were still breathing

  that night the outbound stages
west and south were crowded with
passengers who displayed a sudden
desire for travel to distant parts
other fugitives boarded the freight
trains going north and east still
others stole teams or saddle stock to
make a quick get-away even a few
left town on foot

  all fled in terror of stoudenmayer

  the next morning over two hun-
dred men were missing the gen-
eral departure of killers and bad
men was complete the little fron-
tier town was entirely free from
those who had been for a time its
most prominent citizens

  in the space of twenty-four hours
bill stoudenmayer had made good
his words to the councilmen who
hired him and justly earned his
wages

  the incidents related in this true story
of the wild west took place in the early
s at what is now the city of el paso
fate which granted stoudenmayer a
charmed life as a gun fighter on the side
of the law soon turned against him when
he gave up the silver badge of office a
few weeks after he resigned as town mar-
shall he was killed in a private quarrel-

says my contribution this time is

hunter which mrs erickson of
montana sent in some time ago
hope you like it

the buffalo huntef

one day a fellow came to me and offered
      me a job

  a-killin meat for an immigrant train
      he said

at thirty-five a month tuh kill injuns that
wish tuh rob
or place a tommyhawk in yore head


street  smiths wild west weekly

 i very quickly accepted as other fools had
      done

i merrily left my sweetheart and started
      on the trip-

for foolishly i thought it would be fun-
with my sharps across my saddle and
a six upon my hip

fore many days had slipped away

wed tired of beans mixed well with
      prairie range

so the boss said yuh meat rustlers must
      venture out to-day

cause our line of chuck must have a
      change

me and several others all day we tramped
      around

to find the shaggy buffalo so we could
      shoot him down

we held our guns to shoulder-our belts
      had forty round-

and we sent the buffalo to his happy
      huntin grounds

we went upon the buffalo range as all
     poor hunters do

 to disrobe the shaggy fellow we thought
      it was no harm

our game was antelope wolf buffalo

and deer whose coat we took to keep
      our bodies warm

our fires were of buffalo chips the beds
      lay on the ground

 we had to fight the scorpions while in-
      juns circled round

when we reached our destination i left
      the ol train flat

cause i admire tuh keep my scalplock
      neath my hat

this song has no history that i
know of henry lewis goes on tuh
say its one my father used to

ters sometimes the changes want

kid at this weeks meetin o
the corner whats the matter
with startin the meetin now
everybodys here aint they

  we glances up at the clock feelin
kind o worried fer it is getting kind
o late but we shakes our head at
the kids question

  we aint all here yet kid we
says an then has ter grin ter see
the hull outfit from billy west ter
lum yates start lookin aroun ter
count noses

  buck foster joe scott and sing
lo are in their usual places like-
wise jim hazel an the tigor boys
is settin over in one corner talkin
ter lum yates an zeke johnny
forty-five and george krumm is
there too we cant blame the wad-
dies fer bein puzzled it shore looks
like everybodys on hand who kin
be expected

  but weve got a surprise cornin
an before we kin git any more wor-
ried theres a knock at the door

we grins an starts ter let em in
everybody stops talkin an watches
us

  come right in gents we says
yuh shore are welcome ter the
corner step up an meet the
outfit

  swingin the door wide open we
ushers in two new hombres one is
a tall lanky sort o slow-lookin
jasper with a big chaw o terbaccer
bulgin in his cheek

  the other is a short bow-legged
peppery-lookin waddy with freckles
an a grin thet does an hombres
heart good jest ter look at

  gents we says takin each o
the newcomers by the arm an
leadin em up under the light sos
all the others kin git a good look at
em meet hungry hawkins an
rusty bolivar-a couple o cow-
punch texas rangers who yore
goin ter see a hull lot of from now
on out hungry an rusty meet
the bunch

  first off the two rangers is a


street  smiths wild west weekly

bit flustered but the gang steps up
an gives em the glad hand pronto
in a couple o minutes anybodyd
a thought thet theyd all been
pards fer life them two gun-
slingin rangers fits right inter the
corner like they does in a saddle

  we shuffles through the stack o
mail while theyre all gittin ac-
quainted then we raps on the
table an tells hungry an rusty a
little somethin about what the
wranglers corner is-how its a
place where all the waddies kin git
together every week an hear what
the readin hombres has ter say
about em

  at last we figures its time ter
git started so we reaches down an
grabs out a letter ter read here
it is	

  dear range boss i never cared much
for magazines until i happened to pick up
a w some time ago it belonged to my
brother and he had just finished reading
it i started in on it and since then ive
been one of the regulars

  your w w w would be the very best
in the country if it wasnt for lum yates
i think that he is a flop

  tell that bob shaw hombre that i dont
like him what does he care if we read-
ers write in and criticize the magazine
thats what the wranglers corner is for
isnt it or am i wrong

  buck foster would be the best-looking
bravest and smartest hombre on the
spread if he was the only one on it and
the same thing goes for that carrot-topped
joe scott tell em i said so

  there are a few hombres who say that
circle j should be left out of the maga-
zine every once in a while i disagree
with em if those pards werent in i
wouldnt read the magazine

  i know that this letter wont be printed
because there really isnt any such place
as the wranglers corner however good
luck to you anyway

  yours till buck fosters vest gets stolen

  south bend indiana	whoosis

  rusty bolivar looks kind o puz-
zled at the way thet letter ends

  whats he mean about there not
bein no sech place as this boss

he asks an whats buck fosters
vest got ter do with it

  we chuckles yuh see its this
way rusty we says a lot o
folks gits the idea thet we make up
all the letters we reads here our-
selves-thet we dont really read the
letters thet come in from the readin
hombres as fer bucks vest-

waal hes got-

  hes got a mangy moth-eaten
good-fer-nothin thing thet he wears
aroun-an even sleeps in puts in
joe scott hes always beefin an
blowin about it an tryin ter
smoke up hombres thet dont think

its so good he-

  am thet so roars the battered
circle j top hand ill be a horned
toad if this aint the best vest any
o yuh locoed rannihans ever seen
in yore misspent lives take a look
at it yuh two rangers an see if

i	aint right

  he stands up an holds out the
lower corner o thet famous vest
rusty looks at it an jest then a
moth flies up past the little rangers
face

  everybody laughs except buck
who stands there with his eyes
a-bulgin an the ends o his long
mustache aquiverin he cant make
it out nohow

 but we winks at sing lo the
chink cook o the circle j outfit
we seen him catch thet moth as it
fluttered aroun the lamp a while
back he let it go right under
buck an it looks like it comes from
the veterans vest

  we gits on ter the rest o the mail
pronto though fer our time is shore
flyin heres the next one we
reads

  dear range boss this is the second
letter i have written to the wranglers cor-
ner you did not publish my first one
but i am no quitter

  that fellow rae of leroy illinois
the wranglers corner



is all wet i happen to be a particular
friend of johnny forty-five if i could
meet up with that rae jasper id fill him
so full of holes hed look like a sieve

  he is just mad because he cant be a
good poet like johnny forty-five he has
to take his spite out on somebody

  boss please put johnny in more than
you do he is a swell hombre

  by the way whatever happened to sil-
ver carroll we would like to hear from
him again pretty soon are you ever
going to have him in again he was good
and so was the black ace bring them
both back

  all the other waddies on the spread are
good except jim hazel he isnt so bad
but i dont like forest stories be sure to
have kid wolf and the ranny kid in
next week

yours till buck turn sheep-herder

oakland california j d dupree

 johnny forty-five looks up an
grins at us as we stops readin he
never says so but he shore likes ter
have the readin hombres say good
things about him

    boss you tell j d dupree
    thet these words come from me

    im mighty glad yuh feel thet way
    but dont yuh be too hard on rae 

 hungry an rusty looks over at
jfchnny with their eyes bulgin
they aint never heard nothin like
thet afore an dont know what ter
make of it

 dont mind him gents we
says laughin thets jest the way
he alius acts hes plumb harmless
in spite of his rhymin-that is to
his friends

 then we picks up the next let-
ter which same is

  dear range boss we are sending you
this letter to tell you what we think of
the w spread it is great stuff we
like especially kid wolf and sonny tabor

  as a whole we think that the reading
hombres who bark about buck foster sure
have another guess coming that old ran-
nihan is all right

  tell the ranny kid to plant a  slug
in his old enemy ad bland its the
only way hell ever be rid of him

  also give johnny forty-five the hint
that he should leave that ood-fornoth-
ing george krumm behind the next time
he starts out on a job

  please print this letter in the corner

                  yours truly

  the black ace and the scorpion

  an then we comes ter this one

  dear range boss this is my first let-
ter to you although i have been reading
the w for over two years and if i said i
enjoy reading the w stories i wouldnt
half express my feelings

  one doesnt have to be a stenographer
to chew gum excitedly when one is in the
midst of one of the w stories boy
give me that magazine and a good old-
fashioned rocker by a lamp and will i be
good

  tell stephen payne to give blondy a
break and write more about him walker
tompkins sure puts it there when it comes
to expressing haunts and weird screams
a little more of dan pearson wouldnt be
so hard to take

  say i nearly forgot about billy west
joe and buck why they simply cant
be beat wow what a cast that would

make for a movie and sing lo- boy

me for that instead of a greta garbo any
time and im a girl

  maybe because i was born on a farm
and did a lot of horseback riding that im
crazy about western stories and horses

  well if you dont print this letter in
the wranglers corner i wont believe
there is one	yours truly

alice r rudnick

  chicago illinois

 thet one shore gives the hom-
bres a kick although any mention
o bein in the movies kind of up-
sets em theyre too plumb bash-
ful we reckon ter ever make good
actors

 then we has time fer jest one
more here it is right out o the
bag

  dear range boss this isnt my first
letter to you but i just had to write to
you again to let you know that i am still
a steady reader

  my favorites are still the same kid
wolf sonny johnny and the circle j

  but this time i want to tell you about


street  smiths wild west weekly

some of the other stories and characters
which i have enjoyed very much

that samuel nickels sure puts action
and tang in his stories his guns of so-
nora and ranger talkin  were two of
the best stories i have ever read because
they were different

well so long hope the gang gets a
chance to hear this letter

                      yours truly

i saved six orders and
made  in one day  

thanks to this pocket volume

 ve only been selling about a
 year when i broke in though
 i realized that trained salesmen
 are the highest paid men in the world
 i expected the going to be hard at
 first it was-a lot harder than id
 expected even at the end of six
 months i was commencing to get
 discouraged i certainly hadnt made
 a flop of it-but i wasnt getting the
 rest  should have had

   naturally seeing other fellows
 who started right with me go right
 ahead i realized something was
 wrong a particularly disheartening
 thing was the fact that at times id
 be right on the point of closing a
 good-sized order-and all of a sud-
 den it would go flop in fact it
 kept happening all the time i was
 doing something i knew that was
 killing those sales

   finally i decided that i had to
 do something i had been hearing a
 lot about national salesmens train-
 ing association but id never in-
 vestigated them then one day 
 read one of their announcements i
 was amazed to find how comprehen-
 sively they covered the training of
 salesmen furthermore they an-
 nounced that they were sending a
 most unusual volume the key to
 master salesmanship to ambitious
 men who asked for it-not only ex-
 perienced salesmen but men who
 -d never sold but wanted a chance
 this highly paid field

    lirally i wrote for it-it seemed
 to me at here was the certain solu-
 tion to the errors i had been making
 imagine my surprise-and interest-
 when there arrived not only one
 book but two to this day i cant
 decide which of those books helped
 me most the little book which i
 had not been expecting was just
 what i needed at the time it was

    a new and finer edition

     thousands who read the original
  edition of the key to master
   salesmanship are men who today
  are among the leaders of successful
  selling today in addition to mis-
  takes commonly made in selling 
  we are sending the key to master
  salesmanship in its new and finer
  edition the product of years of
  salesmanship research free to
  salesmen real ambition and a de-
  sire to make the most of salesman-
  ship are all you need
  to get this volume

  simply mail the cou-
  pon and it will be
  to you with
  our own copy of
  mistakes cob-
  ily made in
  ing

 ings work plus the advice of a little
 book that cost me nothing

   of course that set me to thinking
 if that one piece of knowledge could
 make me  how much would i make
 out of having all the knowledge which
 the national salesmens training asso-
 ciation could give me it didnt take
 long to figure that one out either  i
 was enrolled for the full training that
 same night and the next two weeks
 saw my sales record soar not a min-
 ute of time lost-i studied just in
 spare hours but i learned things in
 those spare hours that id never have
 picked up just by my own experience

   today i find amazing increase in

                                                               the volume of my
                                                               sales now over
                                                               what they were
                                                               a year ago then
                                                               i was selling
