 a s i stepped into the narrow
a bridgeroom the pilot at the
l jl controls there turned toward
me saluting

  alpha centauri dead ahead sir
he reported

  turn thirty degrees outward i
told him and throttle down to
eighty light-speeds until weve passed
the star

  instantly the shining levers flicked
back under his hands and as i
stepped over to his side i saw the
arrows of the speed-dials creeping
backward with the slowing of our
flight then gazing through the
broad windows which formed the
rooms front side  watched the inter-
stellar panorama ahead shifting side-

wise with the turning of our course

  the narrow bridgeroom lay across
llie very top of our ships long cigar-
like hull and through its windows all
the brilliance of the heavens around
us lay revealed ahead flamed the
great double star of alpha centauri
two mighty blazing suns which
dimmed all else in the heavens and
which crept slowly sidewise as we
veered away from them toward our
right there stretched along the inky
skies the far-flung powdered fires of
the galaxys thronging suns gemmed
with the crimson splendors of betel-
geuse and the clear brilliance of
canopus and the hot white light of
rigel and straight ahead now
gleaming out bevond the twin suns we

weird tales

were passing shone the clear yellow
star that was the sun of our own
system

  it was the yellow star that i was
watching now as our ship fled on
toward it at eighty times the speed of
light for more than two years had
passed since our cruiser had left it to
become a part of that great navy of
the federation of stars which main-
tained peace over all the galaxy we
had gone far with the fleet in those
two years cruising with it the length
and breadth of the milky way
patrolling the space-lanes of the
galaxy and helping to crush the occa-
sional pirate ships which appeared
to levy toll on the interstellar com-
merce and now that an order flashed
from the authorities of our own solar
system had recalled us home it was
with an unalloyed eagerness that we
looked forward to the moment of our
return the stars we had touched at
the peoples of their worlds these had
been friendly enough toward us as
fellow-members of the great federa-
tion jret for all their hospitality we
had been glad enough to leave them
for though we had long ago become
accustomed to the alien and unliuman
forms of the different stellar races
from the strange brain-men of algol
to the birdlike people of sirius their
worlds were not human worlds not
the familiar eight little planets which
swung around our own sun and
toward which we were speeding
homeward now

  while i mused thus at the window
the two circling suns of alpha
centauri had dropped behind us and
now with a swift clicking of switches
the pilot beside me turned on our full
speed within a few minutes our
ship was hurtling on at almost a
thousand light-speeds flung forward
by the power of our newly invented
de-transforming generators which
could produce propulsion-vibrations
of almost a thousand times the fre-
quency of the light-vibrations at
this immense velocity matched by few

other craft in the galaxy we were
leaping through millions of miles of
space each second yet the gleaming
yellow star ahead seemed quite un-
changed in size

  abruptly the door behind me
clicked open to admit young dal
nara the ships second-officer de-
scended from a long line of famous
interstellar pilots who grinned at me
openly as she saluted

  twelve more hours sir and well
be there she said

  i smiled at her eagerness youll
not be sorry to get back to our little
sun will you i asked and she
shook her head

  not i it may be just a pin-
head beside canopus and the rest but
theres no place like it in the galaxy
im wondering though what made
them call us back to the fleet so
suddenly

  my own face clouded at that i
dont know i said slowly its
almost unprecedented for any star to
call one of its ships back from the
federation fleet but there must have
been some reason-

  well she said cheerfully turn-
ing toward the door it doesnt
matter what the reason is so long as
it means a trip home the crew is
worse than i am-theyre scrapping
the generators down in the engine-
room to get another light-speed out of
them

  i laughed as the door clicked shut
behind her but as i turned back to
the window the question she had
voiced rose again in my mind and i
gazed thoughtfully toward the yellow
star ahead for as i had told dal
nara it was a well-nigh unheard-of
thing for any star to recall one of its
cruisers from the great fleet of the
federation including as it did every
peopled star in the galaxy the
federation relied entirely upon the
fleet to police the interstellar spaces
and to that fleet each star contributed
its quota of cruisers only a last
extremity i knew would ever induce
the star-stealers



any star to recall one of its ships yet
the message flashed to our ship had
ordered us to return to the solar
system at full speed and report at the
bureau of astronomical knowledge
on neptune  whatever was behind
the order  thought i would learn
soon enough for we were now speed-
ing over the last lap of our homeward
journey so i strove to put tire matter
from my mind for the time being

  with an odd persistence though
the question continued to trouble my
thoughts in the hours that followed
and when we finally swept in toward
the solar system twelve hours later it
was with a certain abstractedness that
i watched the slow largening of the
yellow star that was our sun our
velocity had slackened steadily as we
approached that star and we were
moving at a bare one light-speed
when we finally swept down toward
its outermost far-swinging planet
neptune the solar systems point of
arrival and departure for all inter-
stellar commerce even this speed we
reduced still further as we sped past
neptunes single circling moon and
down through the crowded shipping-
lanes toward the surface of the planet
itself

  fifty miles above its surface all
sight of the planet beneath was shut
oft by the thousands of great ships
which hung in dense masses above it
-that vast tangle of interstellar
traffic which makes the great planet
the terror of all inexperienced pilots
from horizon to horizon it seemed
the ships crowded upon each other
drawn from every quarter of the
galaxy huge grain-boats from betel-
geuse vast palatial liners from
arcturus and vega ship-loads of
radium ores from the worlds that
circle giant antares long swift mail-
boats from distant deneb-all these
and myriad others swirled and
circled in one great mass above
the planet dropping down one
by one as the official traffic-direc-
tors flashed from their own boats

the brilliant signals which allowed a
lucky one to descend and through
occasional rifts in the crowded mass
of ships could be glimpsed the inter-
planetary traffic of the lower levels a
swarm of swift little boats which
darted ceaselessly back and forth on
their comparatively short journeys
ferrying crowds of passengers to
jupiter and venus and earth seem-
ing like little toy-boats beside the
mighty bulks of the great interstellar
ships above them

 as our own cruiser drove down
toward the mass of traffic though it
cleared away from before us in-
stantly for the symbol of the federa-
tion on our bows was known from
canopus to fomalhaut and the
cruisers of its fleet were respected by
all the traffic of the galaxy arrowing
down through this suddenly opened
lane we sped smoothly down toward
the planets surface hovering for a
moment above its perplexing maze of
white buildings and green gardens
and then slanting down toward the
mighty flat-roofed building which
housed the bureau of astronomical
knowledge as we sped down toward
its roof i could not but contrast the
warm sunny green panorama beneath
with the icy desert which the planet
had been until two hundred thousand
years before when the scientists of
the solar system had devised the
great heat-transmitters which catch
the suns heat near its blazing surface
and fling it out as high-frequency
vibrations to the reeeiving-apparatus
on neptune to be transformed back
into the heat which warms this world
in a moment though we were land-
ing gently upon the broad roof upon
which rested scores of other shining
cruisers whose crews stood outside
them watching our arrival

  five minutes later i was whirling
downward through the buildings in-
terior in one of the automatic little
cone-elevators out of which i stepped
into a long white corridor an at-
tendant was awaiting me there and


weird tales

i followed him down the corridors
length to a high black door at its end
which he threw open for me closing
it behind me as i stepped inside

it was an ivory-walled high-ceil-
inged room in which i found my-
self its whole farther side open to
the sunlight and breezes of the green
gardens beyond at a desk across the
room was sitting a short-set man with
gray-streaked hair and keen inquir-
ing eyes and as i entered he sprang
up and came toward me

 ran rarak he exclaimed
youve come for two days now
weve been expecting you

  we were delayed off aldebaran
sir by generator trouble i replied
bowing for i had recognized the
speaker as hurus hoi chief of the
bureau of astronomical knowledge
now at a motion from him i took
a chair beside the desk while he
resumed his own seat

 a moment he regarded me in
silence and then slowly spoke ran
rarak  lie said   you must have
wondered why your ship was ordered
back here to the solar system well
it was ordered back for a reason
which we dared not state in an open
message a reason which if made
public would plungethe solar system
instantly into a chaos of unutterable
panic  

  he was silent again for a moment
his eyes on mine and then went on
you know ran rarak that the
universe itself is composed of infinite
depths of space in which float great
clusters of suns star-clusters which
are separated from each other by
billions of light-years of space you
know too that our own cluster of
suns which we call the galaxy is
roughly disklike in shape and that
our own particular sun is situated at
the very edge of this disk beyond
lie only those inconceivable leagues of
space which separate us from the
neighboring star-clusters or island-

universes depths of space never yet
crossed by our own cruisers or by
anything else of which ave have
record

  but now at last something has
crossed those abysses is crossing
them since over three weeks ago our
astronomers discovered that a
gigantic dark star is approaching our
galaxy from the depths of infinite
space-a titanic dead sun which thei r
instruments showed to be of a size
incredible since dark and dead as it
is it is larger than the mightiest blaz-
ing suns in our own galaxy larger
than canopus or antarcs or betel -
geuse-a dark dead star millions of
times larger than our own fiery sun
-a gigantic wanderer out of some far
realm of infinite space racing toward
our galaxy at a velocitv inconceiv-
able

  the calculations of our scientists
showed that this speeding dark star
would not race into our galaxy but
would speed past its edge and out into
infinite space again passing no closer
to our own sun at that edge than
some fifteen billion miles there was
no possibility of collision or danger
from it therefore and so though the
approach of the dark star is known to
all in the solar system there is no
idea of any peril connected with it
but there is something else which has
been kept quite secret from the
peoples of the solar system something
known only to a few astronomers and
officials and that is that during the
last few weeks the path of this speed-
ing dark star has changed from a
straight path to a curving one that
it is curving inward toward the edge
of our galaxy and will now pass our
own sun in less than twelve weeks
at a distance of less than three
billion miles instead of fifteen and
when this titanic dead sun passes that
close to our own sun there can be but
one result inevitably our own sun
will be caught by the powerful
gravitational grip of the giant dark
star and carried out with all its
the star-ktealers



planets into the depths ol infinite
space never to return   

  hurus llol paused his lace white
and set gazing past me with wide un-
seeing eyes my brain whirling be-
neath the stunning revelation i sat
rigid silent and in a moment lie went
on

  if this thing were known to all
he said slowly there would be an in-
stant terrible panic over the solar
system and for that reason only a
handful have been told flight is im-
possible for there are not enough
ships in the galaxy to transport the
trillions of the solar systems popula-
tion to another star in the four weeks
that are left to us there is but one
chance-one blind slender chance-
and that is to turn aside this onward-
thundering dark star from its present
inward-curving path to cause it to
pass our sun and the galaxys edge
far enough away to be harmless and
it is for this reason that we ordered
your return

  for it is my plan to speed out of
the galaxy into the depths of outer
space to meet this approaching dark
star taking all of the scientific ap-
paratus and equipment which might
be used o swerve it aside from this
curving path it is following during
the last week i have assembled the
equipment for the expedition and
have gathered together a force of
fifty star-eruisers which are even now
resting on the roof of this building
manned and ready for the trip these
are only swift mail-eruisers though
specially equipped for the trip and it
was advisable to have at least one
bat tle-cruiser for flag-ship of the
force and so your own was recalled
from the federation fleet and al-
though i shall go with the expedi-
tion of course it was my plan to have
you yourself as its captain

  i know however that you have
spent the last two years in the service
of the federation fleet so if you de-
sire another will be appointed to the
post it is one of danger-greater

danger  think than any of us can
dream yet the command is yours
if you wish to accept it

  hurus itol ceased intently scan-
ning my face a moment i sat silent
then rose and stepped to the great
open window at the rooms far side
outside stretched the greenery of gar-
dens and beyond them the white roofs
of buildings gleaming beneath the
faint sunlight instinctively my eyes
went up to the source of that light
the tiny sun small and faint and far
here but still-the sun a long mo-
ment i gazed up toward it and then
 timed back to hurus hoi

  i accept sir t said

  he came to his feet his eyes shin-
ing i knew that you would he
said simply and then all has been
ready for days ran rarak we start
at once  

  ten minutes later we were on the
broad roof and the crews of our fifty
ships were rushing to their posts in
answer to the sharp alarm of a signal-
bell another five minutes and hurus
hoi dal xara and i slood in the
bridgeroom of my own cruiser watch-
ing the white roof drop behind and
beneath as we slanted up from it in
a moment the half-hundred cruisers
on that roof had risen and were rac-
ing up behind us arrowing with us
toward the zenith massed in a close
wedge-shaped form at ion

  above the brilliant signals of the
traffic-boats flashed swiftly clearing
a wide lane for us and then we had
passed through the jam of traffic and
were driving out past  he incoming
lines of interstellar ship at swiftly
mounting speed still holding the
same formation with the massed cruis-
ers behind us

 behind and around us now
flamed the great panorama of the
galaxys blazing stars but before us
lay only darkness-darkness incon-
ceivable into which our ships were
lashing out at greater and greater
speed neptune had vanished and
far behind lay the single yellow spark


weird tales

that was all visible of our solar sys-
tem as we fled out from it out-
oul-out-rocketing racing on out
past the boundaries of the great gal-
axy itself into the lightless void out
into the unplumbed depths of infinite
space to save our threatened sun

o

npwenty-four hours after our start
i stood again in he bridgeroom
alone except for the silent imper-
turbable figure of my ever-watch ful
wheelman nal jak staring out with
him into the black gulf that lav before
us many an hour we had stood side
by side thus scanning the interstellar
spaces from our cruisers bridgeroom
but never yet had my eyes been con-
fronted by such a lightless void as lay
before me now

  our ship indeed seemed to be rac-
ing through a region where light was
all but non-existent a darkness in-
conceivable to anyone who had never
experienced it behind lay the gal-
ax- we had left a great swarm of
shining points of light contracting
slowly as wo sped away from it to-
ward our right too several misty
little patches of light glowed faintly
in the darkness hardly to be seen
though theso i knew were other
galaxies or star-clusters like our own
-titanic conglomerations of throng-
ing suns dimmed to those tiny flickers
of light by the inconceivable depths
of space which separated them from
ourselves

  except for these though we fled
on through a cosmic gloom that was
soul-shaking in its deepness and ex-
tent an infinite darkness and stillness
in which our ship seemed the only
moving thing behind us i knew
the formation of our fifty ships was
following close on our track each ship
separated from the next by a five
hundred mile interval and each flash-
ing on at exactly the same speed as
ourselves but though we knew they
followed our fifty cruisers were nat-

urally quite invisible to us and as  i
gazed now into the tenebrous void
ahead the loneliness of our position
was overpowering

 abruptly the door behind me
snapped open and i half turned to-
ward it as ilurus hoi entered he
glanced at our speed-dials and his
brows arched in surprize

    good enough   he commented
if the rest of our ships can hold this
pace it will bring us to the dark star
in six days

  i nodded gazing thoughtfully
ahead perhaps sooner i esti-
mated the dark star is coming
toward us at a tremendous velocity
remember you will notice on the
telechart- 

  together we stepped over to the big
telechart a great rectangular plate of
smoothly burnished silvery metal
which hung at the bridgerooms end-
wall the one indispensable aid to
interstellar navigation upon it were
accurately reproduced by means of
projected and reflected rays the posi-
tions and progress of all heavenly
bodies near the ship intently we
contemplated it now at the rec-
tangles lower edge there gleamed on
the smooth metal a score or more of
little circles of glowing light of vary-
ing sizes representing the suns at the
edge of the galaxy behind us outer-
most of these glowed the light-disk
that was our own sun and aroirnd this
ilurus iiol had drawn a shining line
or circle lying more than four billion
miles from our sun on the chart he
had computed that if the approaching
dark star came closer than that to our
sun its mighty gravitational attrac-
tion would inevitably draw the latter
out with it into space so the shining
line represented for us the danger-
line and creeping down toward that
line and toward our sun farther up
on the blank metal of the great chart
there moved a single giant circle of
deepest black an ebon disk a hundred
times the diameter of our glowing
little sun-circle which was sweeping
the star-stealers



down toward the galaxys edge in a
great curve

  hums hoi gazed thoughtfully at
the sinister dark disk and then shook
his head theres something very
strange about that dark star he
said slowly that curving path its
moving in is contrary to all the laws
of celestial mechanics i wonder
if-

  before he could finish the words
were broken off in his mouth for at
that moment there came a terrific
shock our ship dipped and reeled
crazily and then was whirling blindly
about as though caught and shaken
by a giant hand dal nara the pilot
hums ttol and i were slammed
violently down toward the bridge-
room s eml with the first crash and
then i clung desperately to the edge
of a switeh-board as we spun dizzily
about i had a flashing glimpse
through the windows of our fifty
cruisers whirling blindly about like
wind-tossed straws and in another
glimpse saw two of them caught and
slammed together both ships smash-
ing like egg-shells beneath the terrific
impact their crews instantly anni-
hilated then as our own ship
dipped crazily downward again i
saw hums hoi creeping across the
floor toward the controls and in a
moment  had slid down beside him
another instant and we had our
hands on the levers and were slowly
pulling them back into position

  caught and buffeted still by live
terrific forces outside our cruiser
slowly steadied to an even keel and
then leapt suddenly forward again
the forces that held us seeming to
lessen swiftly as we flashed on there
came a harsh grating sound that
brought my heart to my throat as one
of the cruisers was hurled past us
grazing us and then abruptly the
mighty grip that held us had
suddenly disappeared and we were
humming on through the same still-
ness and silence as before

  i slowed our flight then until we

hung motionless and then we gazed
wildly at each other bruised and
panting before we could give utter-
ance to the exclamations on our lips
though the door snapped open and
dal nara burst into the bridgeroom
bleeding from a cut on her forehead

  what was that she cried rais-
ing a trembling hand to her head
it caught us there like toys-and

the other ships-

  before any ot us could answer her
a bell beside me rang sharply and
from the diaphragm beneath it came
the voice of our message-operator

  ships    and  reported
destroyed by collisions sir he an-
nounced his own voice tremulous
the others report that they are
again taking up formation behind
us  

  very well  replied order
them o start again in three minutes
on number one speed-scale 

  as i turned back from the instru-
ment i drew a deep breath four
ships destroyed in less than a minute
 said and by what

  by a whirlpool of ether-currents
undoubtedly said hums hoi we
stared at him blankly and he threw
out a hand in quick explanation

	 you know that there are currents in
the ether-that was discovered ages
ago-and that those currents are
responsible for light-drift and similar
phenomena all such currents in the
galaxy have always been found to be
comparatively slow and sluggish but
out here in empty space there must be
currents of gigantic size and speed
and apparently we stumbled directly
into a great whirlpool or maelstrom
of them we were fortunate to lose
hut four ships   he added soberly

  i shook my head   ive sailed from
sirius to rigel i said and i never
met anything like that and if we

meet another-

  the strangeness of our experience
in fact had unnerved me for even
after we had tended to our bruises
and were again racing on through the


weird tales

void it was with a new fearfulness
that i gazed ahead at any moment
i knew we might plunge directly into
some similar or even larger maelstrom
of ether-currents yet there was no
way by which we could avoid the
danger we must drive blindly
ahead at full speed and trust to luck
to bring us through and now i began
to understand what perils lay between
us and our destination

  as hour followed hour though my
fearfulness gradually lessened for we
encountered no more of the dread
maelstroms in our onward flight yet
as we hummed on and on and on a
new anxiety came to trouble me for
with the passing of each day we were
putting behind us billions of miles of
space and were flashing nearer and
nearer toward the mighty dark star
lhat was our goal and even as we
fled on we could see on the great
telechart the dark disk creeping
down to meet us thundering on
toward the galaxy from which unless
we succeeded it would steal a star

  unless we succeeded but could
we succeed was there any force in
the universe that could turn aside this
oncoming dark giant in time to pre-
vent the theft of our sun  more and
more as we sped on there grew in
my mind doubt as to our chance of
success we had gone forth on a
blind desperate venture on a last
slender chance and now at last i
began to see how slender indeed was
that chance dal nara felt it too
and even hurus hoi i think but we
spoke no word to each other of our
thoughts standing for hours on end
in the bridgeroom together and
gazing silently and broodingly out
into the darkness where lay our goal

on the sixth day of our flight we
computed by means of our tele-
chart and flight-log that we were
within less than a billion miles of the
great dark star ahead and had
slackened our speed until we were
barely creeping forward attempting

to locate our goal in the dense un-
changed darkness ahead

  straining against the windows
we three gazed eagerly forward
while beside me nal jak the
wheelman silently regulated the
ships speed to my orders minutes
passed while we sped on and still
there lay before us only the deep
darkness could it be that we had
missed our way that our calculations
had been wrong could it be-and
then the wild speculations that had
begun to rise in my mind were cut
short by a low exclamation from dal
nara beside me mutely she pointed
ahead

  at first i could see nothing and
then slowly became aware of a feeble
glow of light in the heavens ahead
an area of strange subdued light
which stretched across the whole sky
it seemed yet which was so dim
as to be hardly visible to our
straining eyes but swiftly as we
watched it it intensified strength-
ened taking shape as a mighty circle
of pale luminescence which filled
almost all the heavens ahead i gave
a low-voiced order to the pilot which
reduced our speed still further but
even so the light grew visibly stronger
as avc sped on

    light   whispered hurus hoi
light on a dark star its impos-
sible-and yet-

  and now in obedience to another
order our ship began to slant sharply
up toward the mighty circlesupper
limb followed by the half-hundred
ships behind us and as we lifted
higher and higher the circle changed
before our eyes into a sphere-a
tremendous faintly glowing sphere of
size inconceivable filling the heavens
with its vast bulk feebly luminous
like the ghost of some mighty sun
rushing through space to meet us as
we sped up and over it and now at
last we were over it sweeping above
it with our little fleet at a height of
a half-million miles contemplating in
the tab-stealers



awed silence the titanic dimensions of
the faint-glowing sphere beneath us

  for in spite of our great height
above it the vast globe stretched from
horizon to horizon beneath us a
single smooth vastly curving surface
shining with the dim unfamiliar
light whose source we could not
guess it was not the light of fire or
glowing gases for the sun below was
truly a dead one vast in size as it
was it wras a cold light a faint but
steady phosphorescence like no other
light i had ever seen a feeble white
glow which stretched from horizon to
horizon of the mighty world beneath
dumfoundedly we stared down to-
ward it and then at a signal to the
pilot our ship began to drop
smoothly downward trailed by our
forty-odd followers behind down
down we sped slower and slower
until we suddenly started as there
came from outside the ship a high-
pitched hissing shriek

  air i cried this dark star
has an atmosphere and that light
upon it-see   and i flung a point-
ing hand toward the surface of the
giant world below for as we dropped
swiftly down toward that world wc
saw at last that the faint light which
illuminated it was not artificial light
or reflected light but light inherent
in itself since all the surface of the
mighty sphere glowed with the same
phosphorescent light its plains and
hills and valleys alike feebly
luminous with the soft dim lu-
minosity of radio-active minerals a
shining world a world glowing
eternally with cold white light a lu-
minous titanic sphere that rushed
through the darkness of infinite space
like some pale gigantic moon and
upon the surface of the glowing
plains beneath us rose dense and
twisted masses of dark leafless
vegetation distorted tree-growths and
tangles of low shrubs that were all of
deepest black in color springing out
of that glowing soil and twisting
blackly and grotesquely above its

feeble light stretching away over
plain and hill and valley like the
monstrous landscape of some un-
dreamed-of hell

  and now as our ship slanted down
across the surface of the glowing
sphere there gleamed ahead a deep-
ening of that glow a concentration of
that feeble light which grew stronger
as we raced on toward it and it was
a city a city whose mighty build-
ings were each a truncated pyramid
in shape towering into the air for
thousands upon thousands of feet a
city whose every building and street
and square glowed with the same
faint white ligfit as the ground upon
which they stood a metropolis out of
nightmare the darkness of which was
dispelled only by the light of its own
great glowing structures and streets
far away stretched the mass of those
structures a luminous mass which
covercd square mile upon square mile
of the surface of this glowing world
and far beyond them thero lifted into
the dusky air the shining towers and
pyramids of still other cities

  we straightened trembling turn-
ing toward each other with white
faces and then before any could
speak dal nava had whirled to the
window and uttered a hoarse shout
look she cried and pointed down
and outward toward the titanic
glowing buildings of the city ahead
for from their truncated summits
were rising suddenly a swarm of long
black shapes a horde of long black
cones which were racing straight up
toward us

  i shouted an order to the pilot and
instantly our ship was turning and
slanting sharply upward while
around us our cruisers sped up with
us then from beneath there sped up
toward us a shining little cylinder oi
metal which struck a cruiser racing
beside our own it exploded instantly
into a great flare of blinding light
enveloping the cruiser it had struck
and then the light had vanished
while avith it had vanished the ship it


wetri tales

had enveloped and from the cones
beneath and beyond there leapt to-
ward us other of the metal cylinders
striking our ships now by the dozens
flaring and vanishing with them in
great silent explosions of light

  etheric bombs i cried and
our ship is the only battle-cruiser-
the rest have no weapons

  i turned cried another order and
in obedience to it our own cruiser
halted suddenly and then dipped
downward racing straight into the
ascending swarm of attacking cones
down we flashed down down and
toward us sprang a score of the metal
cylinders grazing along our sides
and then from the sides of our own
downward-swooping ship there sprang
out brilliant shafts of green light the
deadly de-cohesion ray of the ships of
the federation fleet it struck a
score of the cones beneath and they
flamed with green light for an instant
and then flew into pieces spilling
downward in a great shower of tiny
fragments as the cohesion of their
particles was destroyed by the deadly
ray and now our cruiser had
crashed down through the swarm of
them and was driving down toward
the luminous plain below then turn-
ing and racing sharply upward again
while from all the ajr around us the
black cones swarmed to the attack

  up up we sped and now i saw
that our blow had been struck in vain
for the last of our ships above were
vanishing beneath the flares of the
etheric bombs one only of our
cruisers remained racing up toward
the zenith in headlong flight with a
score of the great cones in hot
pursuit a moment only i glimpsed
this and then we had turned once
more and were again diving down
upon the attacking cones while all
around us the etheric bombs filled the
air with the silent exploding flares
again as we swooped downward our
green rays cut paths of annihilation
across the swarming cones beneath
and then i heard u cry from hurus

llol whirled to the window and
glimpsed above us a single great
cone that was diving headlong down
toward us in a resistless ramming
swoop i shouted to the pilot sprang
to the controls but was too late to
ward oft that deadly blow there was
a great crash at the rear of our
cruiser it spun dizzily for a moment
in midair and then was tumbling
crazily downward like a falling stone
toward the glowing plain a score of
miles below

 think now that our cruisers mad
downward plunge must have lasted
for-minutes at least yet at the time
it seemed over in a single instant i
have a confused memory of the
bridgeroom spinning about us as we
whirled down of myself throwing
back the controls with a last instinc-
tive action and then there came a
ripping rending crash a violent
shock and i was flung into a corner
of the room with terrific force

  dazed by the swift action of the
last few minutes i lay there motion-
less for a space of seconds then
scrambled to my feet hums hoi
and dal nara were staggering up
likewise the latter hastening at once
down into the cruisers hull but nal
jak the wheelman lay motionless
against the wall stunned by the
shock our first act was to bring
him back to consciousness by a few
rough first-aid measures and then we
straightened and gazed about us

  apparently our cruisers keel was
resting upon the ground but was
tilted over at a sharp angle as the
slant of the rooms floor attested
through the broad windows we could
see that around our prostrate ship lay
a thick screening grove of black
trce-growths which we had glimpsed
from above and into which we had
crashed in our mad plunge down-
ward as i was later to learn it was
only the shock-absorbing qualities of
the vegetation into which we had
the star-stealers



fallen and my own last-minute rush
to the controls which had slowed our
fall enough to save us from annihila-
tion

  there was a buzz of excited voices
from he crew in the hull beneath us
and then i turned at a sudden
exclamation from hurus hoi to find
him pointing up through the observa-
tion windows in the bridgerooms
ceiling i glanced up then shrank
back for high above were circling a
score or more of the long black cones
which had attacked us and which
were apparently surveying the land-
scape for some clue to our fate 
gave a sharp catch of indrawn breath
as they dropped lower toward us and
we crouched with pounding hearts
while they dropped nearer then we
uttered simultaneous sighs of relief
as the long shapes above suddenly
drove back up toward the zenith
apparently certain of our annihila-
tion massing and wheeling and then
speeding back toward the glowing
city from which they had risen to
attack us

  we rose to our feet again and as

we did so the door clicked open to
admit dal nara she was a bruised
disheveled figure like the rest of us
but there was something like a grin
on her face

 that cone that rammed us
shattered two of our rear vibration-
projectors  she announced but
that was all the damage and out-

vxr 

it was a weird landscape that met their
eyes


weird tales

side of one man with a broken
shoulder the crew is all right  
good i exclaimed it wont
take long to replace the broken pro-
jectors 

  she nodded i ordered them to
put in two of the spares she ex-
plained but what then

  i considered for a moment none
of our other cruisers escaped did
they i asked

  dal nara slowly shook her head

  i dont think so   she said   nearly
all of them were destroyed in the first
few minutes i saw ship  racing
up in an effort to escape heading
back toward the galaxy ljut there
were cones hot after it and it
couldnt have got away

  the quiet voice of hurus hoi broke
in upon us  then we alone can take
back word to the federation of what
is happening here he said his eyes
suddenly flamed two things we
know he exclaimed we know
that this dark stars curving path
through space which will bring it so
fatally near to our own sun in pass-
ing is a path contrary to all the laws
of astronomical science and we
know now too that upon this dark-
star world in those glowing cities
yonder live beings of some sort who
possess apparently immense intelli-
gence and power

  my eyes met his you mean-

i began but he interrupted swiftly

  i mean that in my belief the
answer to this riddle lies in that
glowing city yonder and that it is
there we must go to find that
answer  

  but how i asked if we take
the cruiser near it theyll sight us
and annihilate us

  there is another way said
hurus hoi we can leave the
cruiser and its crew hidden here and
approach the city on foot-get as near
to it as possible-learn what we can
about it

  i think that we all gasped at that
suggestion but as i quickly revolved

it in my mind i saw that it was
in reality our only chance to secure
any information of value to take back
to the federation so we adopted the
idea without further discussion and
swiftly laid our plans for the venture
at first it was our plan for only us
three to go but at dal naras insist-
ence we included the pilot in our
party the more quickly because i
knew her to be resourceful and
quick-witted

two hours we spent in sleep at the
suggestion of hurus hoi then ate
a hasty meal and looked to our
weapons small projectors of the de-
cohesion ray similar to the great ray-
tubes of the cruiser already the
ships two shattered vibration-projee-
tors had been replaced by spares and
our last order was for the crew and
under-officers to await our return
without moving beyond the ship in
any event then the cruisers hull-
door snapped open and we four
stepped outside ready for our
venture

  the sandy ground upon which we
stood glowed with the feeble white
light which seemed to emanate from
all rock and soil on this strange world
a weird light which beat upward
upon us instead of down and in this
light the twisted alien forms of the
leafless trees around us writhed up-
ward into the dusky air their smooth
black branches tangling and inter-
twining far above our heads as we
paused there hurus iiol reached
down for a glowing pebble which he
examined intently for a moment

  radio-active he commented
all this glowing rock and soil
then he straightened glanced around
and led the way unhesitatingly
through the thicket of black forest
into which our ship had fallen

  silently we followed him in single
file across the shining soil and
beneath the distorted arches of the
twisted trees until at last wre emerged
from the thicket and found ourselves
the star-stealers



upon tlie open expanse of the glowing
plain it was a weird landscape
which met our eyes a landscape of
glowing plains and shallow valleys
patched here and there with the
sprawling thickets of black forest a
pale luminous world whose faint
light beat feebly upward into the
dusky twilight skies above in the
distance perhaps two miles ahead a
glow of deeper light flung up against
the hovering dusk from the massed
buildings of the luminous city and
toward this we tramped steadily on-
ward over the shining plains and
gullies and once over a swift little
brook whose waters glowed as they
raced like torrents of rushing light
within an hour we had drawn to
within a distance of five hundred feet
from the outermost of the citys
pyramidal buildings and crouchcd in
a little clump of dark tree-growths
gazing fascinatedly toward it

  the scene before us was one of un-
equaled interest and activity over
the masses of huge shining buildings
were flitting great swarms of the
long black cones moving from roof to
roof while in the shining streets
below them moved other hordes of
active figures the people of the city
and as our eyes took in these latter i
think that we all felt something of
horror in spite of all the alien forms
which we were familiar with in the
thronging worlds of the galaxy

  for in these creatures was no single
point of resemblance to anything
human nothing which the appalled
intelligence could seize upon as
familiar imagine an upright cone
of black flesh several feet in diameter
and three or more in height
supported by a dozen or more smooth
long tentacles which branched from
its lower end - supple boneless
octopus-arms which held the cone-
body upright and which served both
as arms and legs and near the top
of that cone trunk were the only
features the twin tiny orifices which

were the ears and a single round and
red-rimmed white eye set between
them thus were these beings in
appearance black tentacle-creatures
moving in unending swirling throngs
through streets and squares and
buildings of their glowing city

  helplessly we stared upon them
from our place of concealment to
venture into sight  knew would be
to court swift death i turned to
flurus hoi then started as there came
from the city ahead a low waxing
sound-note a deep powerful tone of
immense volume which sounded out
over the city like the blast of a deep-
pitched horn another note joined it
and another until it seemed that a
score of mighty horns were calling
across the city and then they died
away but as we looked now we saw
that the shining streets were empty-
ing suddenly that the moving
swarms of black tentacle-creatures
were passing into the pyramidal
buildings that the cones above
were slanting down toward the roofs
and coming to rest within a space
of minutes the streets seemed entirely
empty and deserted and the only
sign of activity over all the city was
ihe hovering of a few cones that still
moved restlessly above it astounded
we watched and then the explanation
came suddenly to me

  its their sleep-period i cried
their night these things must
rest must sleep like any living thing
and as theres no night on this glow-
ing world those horn-notes must
signal the beginning of their sleep-
period

  hums hoi was on his feet his eyes
suddenly kindling its a chance in
a thousand to get inside the city he
exclaimed

  the next moment we were out of
ihe shelter of our concealing trees
and were racing across ihe stretch of
ground which separated us from the
city and five minutes later we were
standing in the empty glowing


weird tales

streets hugging closely the mighty
sloping walls of the huge buildings
along it

  at once hurus iiol led the way
directly down the street toward the
heart of the city and as we hastened
on beside him he answered to my
question we must get to the citys
center theres something there
which i glimpsed from our ship and
if its what i think-

  he had broken into a inn now
and as we raced together down the
bare length of the great shining
avenue i for one had an unreassur-
ing presentiment of what would
happen should the huge buildings
around us disgorge their occupants
before we could get out of the city
then hurus hoi had suddenly
stopped short and at a motion from
him we shrank swiftly behind the
comer of a pyramids slanting walls
across the street ahead of us were
passing a half-dozen of the tentacle-
creatures gliding smoothly toward
the open door of one of the great
pyramids a moment we crouched
holding our breath and then the
things had passed inside the building
and the door had slid shut behind
them at once we leapt out and
hastened on

  we were approaching the heart of
the city i judged and ahead the
broad shining street we followed
seemed to end in a great open space
of some sort as we sped toward it
between the towering luminous lines
of buildings a faint droning sound
came to our ears from ahead waxing
louder as we hastened on the clear
space ahead was looming larger
nearer now and then as we raced
past the last great building  the
streets length we burst suddenly into
view of the opening ahead and
stopped staring dumfoundedly to-
ward it

  it was no open plaza or square
but a pit - a shallow circular pit
not more than a hundred feet in

depth but all of a mile in diameter
and we stood at the rim or edge of it
the floor was smooth and flat and
upon that floor there lay a grouped
mass of hundreds of half-globes or
hemispheres each fifty feet in diame-
ter which were resting upon their flat
bases with their curving sides upper-
most each of these hemispheres was
shining with light but it was very
different light from the feeble glow
of the buildings and streets around
us an intensely brilliant blue radi-
ance which was all but blinding to our
eyes prom these massed radiant
hemispheres came the loud droning
we had heard and now we saw at the
pits farther edge a cylindrical little
room or structure of metal which was
supported several hundred feet above
the pits floor by a single slender
shaft of smooth round metal like a
great bird-cage and toward this
cage-structure hurus hoi was point-
ing now his eyes flashing

  its the switch-board of the
thing he cried and these
brilliant hemispheres-the unheard-
of space-path of this dark star-its
all clear now all-

  he broke off suddenly as nal jak
sprang back uttering a cry and
pointing upward for the moment
we had forgotten the hovering cones
above the city and now one of them
was slanting swiftly downward
straight toward us

  we turned ran back and the next
moment an etlieric bomb crashed
down upon the spot where we had
stood exploding silently in a great
flare of light another bomb fell and
flared nearer and then i turned with
sudden fierce anger and aimed the
little ray-projector in my hand at the
hovering cone above the brilliant
little beam cut across the dark shape
the black cone hovered still for a
moment then crashed down into the
street to destruction but now from
above and beyond other cones were
slanting swiftly down toward us
the star-stealers



while from the pjramidal buildings
beside us hordes of the black tentaele-
creatures were pouring out in answer
to the alarm

  in a solid resistless swarm they
rushed upon us i heard a yell of
defiance from dal nara beside me
the hiss of our rays as they clove
through the black masses in terrible
destruction and then they were upon
us a single moment we whirled
about in a wild melee of men and
cone-creatures of striking human
arms and coiling tentacles then there
was a shout of warning from one of
my friends something hard descended
upon my head with crushing force
and all went black before me



taint light was filtering through
my eyelids when i came back to
consciousness as i opened them i
sat weakly up then fell back
dazedly i gazed about me i was
lying hi a small square room lit only
by its own glowing walls and floor
and ceiling a room whose one side
slanted steeply upward and inward
pierced by a small barred window
that was the only opening opposite
me i discerned a low door of metal
bars or grating beyond which lay a
long glowing-walled corridor then
all these things were suddenly blotted
out by the anxious face of hurus hoi
bending down toward me

  youre awake he exclaimed his
face alight you know me ran
rarak  

  for answer i struggled again to a
sitting position aided by the arm of
dal nara who had appeared beside
me i felt strangely weak exhausted
my head throbbing with racing fires

  where are we i asked at last
the fight in the city-i remember
that-but where are we now  and
wheres nal jak

  the eyes of my two friends met
and glanced away while i looked

anxiously toward them then hurus
hoi spoke slowly

  we are imprisoned in this little
room in one of the great pyramids of
the glowing city he said and in
this room you have lain for weeks
ran rarak

 weeks i gasped and he
nodded its been almost ten weeks
since we were captured there in the
city outside he said and for all
that time youve lain here out of your
head from that blow you received
sometimes delirious and raving some-
times completely tuiconscious and
in all that timo this dark star this
world has been plunging on through
space toward our galaxy and our
sun and the theft and doom of that
sun ten more days and it passes
our sun stealing it from the galaxy
and i who have learned at last what
forces are behind it all lie prisoned
here

  	 it was after we four were brought
to this cell after our capture that i
was summoned before our captors
before a council of those strange
tentacle-creatures which was made
up i think of their own scientists
they examined me my clothing all
about me then sought to communicate
with me they do not speak-
communicating with each other by
telepathy-but they strove to enter
into communication with me by a pro-
jection of pictures on a smooth wall
pictures of their dark star world pic-
tures of our own galaxy our own
sun-picture after picture until at
last i began to understand the drift
of them the history and the purpose
of these strange beings and their
stranger world

  for ages i learned for countless
eons their mighty sun had flashed
through the infinities of space alone
except for its numerous planets upon
which had risen these races of ten-
tacle-creatures their sun was flam-
ing with life then and on their
circling planets they had attained to


wiud tales

immense science immense power as
their system rolled on a single
wandering star through the depths
of uncharted space but as the
slow eons passed the mighty sun
began to cool and their planets to
grow colder and colder at last it
had cooled so far that to revive its
dying fires they dislodged one of their
own planets from its orbit and sent
it crashing into their sun feeding its
waning flames and when more
centuries had passed and it was again
cooling they followed the same course
sending another planet into it and so
on through the ages staving off the
death of their sun by sacrificing their
worlds until at last but one planet
was left to them and still their
sun was cooling darkening dying

  for further ages though they
managed to preserve a precarious
existence on their single planet by
means of artificial heat-production
until at last their great sun had
cooled and solidified to such a point
lhat life was possible upon its dark
dead surface that surface because
of the solidified radio-active elements
in it shone always with pale light
and to it the races of the tentacle-
creatures now moved by means of
great air-current projectors they
transferred the atnjosphcre of their
planet to the dark star itself and then
cast loose their planet to wander off
into space by itself for its orbit had
become erratic and they feared that
it would crash into their own great
dark star world about which it had
revolved but on the warm shinhur
surface of the great dark star they
now spread out and multiplied
raising their cities from its glowing
rock and clinging to its surface as it
hurtled on and on and on through
the dark infinities of trackless space

  but at last after further ages of
such existence the tentacle-raccs saw
that again they were menaced with
extinction since in obedience to the
inexorable laws of nature their dark

star was cooling still further the
molten fires at its center which
warmed its surface gradually dying
down while that surface became
colder and colder in a little while
they knew the fires at its center
would be completely dead and then-
great world would be a bitter frozen
waste unless they devised some plan
by which to keep warm its surface

  at this moment their astronomers
came forward with the announcement
that their dark-star world plunging
on through empty space would soon
pass a great star-cluster or galaxy of
suns at a distance of some fifteen
billion miles they could not invade
the worlds of this galaxy they knew
for they had discovered that upon
those worlds lived countless trillions
of intelligent inhabitants who would
be able to repel their own invasion if
they attempted it there was but one
expedient left therefore and that
was to attempt to jerk a sun out of
this galaxy as they passed by it to
steal a star from it to take out with
them into space which would revolve
around their own mighty dark world
and supply it with the heat they
needed

  the sun which they fixed on to
steal was one at the galaxys very
edge our own sun if they passed
this at fifteen billion miles as their
course then would cause them to do
they could do nothing but if they
could change their dark stars course
could curve inward to pass this sun
at some three billion miles instead of
fifteen then the powerful gravita-
tional grip of their own gigantic
world would grasp this sun and carry
it out with it into space the suns
planets too would be carried out but
these they planned to crash into the
fires of the sun itself to increase its
size and splendor all that was
needed therefore was some method of
curving their worlds course inward
and for this they had recourse to the
great gravitv-eondensers which they
the star-stealers



had already used to si lift their own
planets

  you know that it is gravitational
force alone which keeps the suns and
planets to their courses and you
know that the gravitational force of
any body sun or planet is radiated
out from it in all directions tending
to pull all things toward that body
in the same way there is radiated
outward perpetually from the galaxy
the combined attractive gravitational
force of all its swarming suns and a
tiny fraction of this outward-radiat-
ing force of course struck the dark
star pulling it weakly toward the
galaxy if more of that outward-
radiating force could strike the dark
star it would be pulled toward the
galaxy with more power would be
pulled nearer toward the galaxys
edge as it passed

  was just that which their
gravity-con denser accomplished in
a low pit at the heart of one of their
cities-this city in fact-they placed
the condenser a mass of brilliant
hemispherical ray-attracters which
caused more of the galaxys outward-
shooting attractive force to fall upon
the dark star which condensed and
concentrated that radiating force
upon the dark star thereby pulling
the dark star inward toward the
galaxys edge in a great curve
when they reached a distance of
three billion miles from the galaxys
edge they planned to turn off the
great condenser and their dark star
would then shoot past the galaxys
edge jerking out our sun with it
from that edge by its own terrific
gravitational grip if the condenser
were turned off before they came that
close however they would pass the
sun at a distance too far to pull it out
with them and would then speed on
out into space alone toward the
freezing of their world and their own
extinction for that reason the con-
denser and the great cage-switch of
the condenser were guarded always

by hovering cones to prevent its
being turned off before the right
moment

 since then they have kept the
great gravity-condenser in unceasing
operation and their dark star has
swept in toward the galaxys edge in
a great curve back in our own solar
system i saw and understood what
would be the result of that inward
curve and so we came here-and
were captured and in those weeks
since we were captured while you
have lain here unconscious and
raving this dark star has been plung-
ing nearer and nearer toward our
galaxy and toward our sun ten
more days and it passes that sun
carrying it out with it into the dark-
ness of boundless space unless the
great condenser is turned off before
then ten more days and we lie
here powerless to warn any of what
forces work toward the doom of our
sun  

 i here was a long silence when
- hurus hois voice had ceased-
a whispering brain-crushing silence
which i broke at last with a single
question

 but nal jak--  asked and

the faces of my two companions be-
came suddenly strange while dal
nara turned away at last hurus
hoi spoke 

  it was after the tentade-seientists
had examined mo he said gently
that they brought nal tak down to
examine t think that they spared
me for the time being because of my
apparently greater knowledge but
nal jak they-vivisected-

  there was a longer hush than be-
fore one in which the brave quiet
figure of the wheelman a companion
in all my service with the fleet
seemed to rise before my suddenly
blurring eyes then abruptly t
swung down from the narrow bunk on
which i lay clutched dizzily at my
companions for support and walked


weird tales

unsteadily to the square barred little
window outside and beneath me lay
the city of the dark-star people a
mighty mass  pyramidal glowing
buildings streets thronged with their
dark gliding figures above them the
swarms of the racing cones from
our little window the glowing wall of
the great pyramid which held us
slanted steeply down for fully five
hundred feet and upward above us
for twice that distance and as i
raised my eyes upward i saw clear
and bright above a great far-flung
field of stars-the stars of our own
galaxy toward which this world was
plunging and burning out clearest
among these the star that was nearest
of all the shining yellow star that
was our own sun

  i	think now that it was the sight of
that yellow star largening steadily
as our dark star swept on toward it
which filled us with such utter
despair in the hours the days that
followed out beyond the city our
cruiser lay hidden hi the black forest
we knew and could we escape we
might yet carry word back to the
federation of what was at hand but
escape was impossible and so
through the long days days measur-
able only by our own time-dials we
waxed deeper intq an apathy of dull
despair

  rapidly my strength came back to
me though the strange food supplied
us once a day by our captors was
almost uneatable but as the days
fled by my spirits sank lower and
lower and less and less we spoke to
each other as the doom of our sun
approached the only change in any
thing around us being the moment
each twenty-four hours when the
signal-horns called across the city
summoning the hordes in its streets to
their four-hour sleep-period at last
though we woke suddenly to realiza-
tion of the fact that nine days had
pased since my awakening and that
upon the next day the dark star

would be plunging past the burning
yellow star above us and jerking it
into its grip then at last all our
apathy dropped from us and we
raged against the walls of our cells
with insensate fury and then with
startling abruptness came the means
of our deliverance

tor hours there had been a busy
clanging of tools and machines
somewhere in the great building above
us and numbers of the tentacle-crea-
tures had been passing our barred
door carrying tools and instruments
toward some work being carried out
overhead we had come to pay but
little attention to them in time but
as one passed there came a sudden
rattle and clang from outside and
turning to the door we saw that one
of the passing creatures had dropped
a thick coil of slender metal chain
upon the floor and had passed on
without noticing his loss

  in an instant we were at the door
and reaching through its bars toward
the coil but though we each strained
our arms in turn toward it the thing
lay a few tantalizing inches beyond
our grasp a moment we surveyed
it baffled fearing the return at any
moment of the creature who had
dropped it and then dal nara with
a sudden inspiration lay flat upon
the floor thrusting her leg out
through the grating in a moment
she had caught the coil with her foot
and in another moment we had it in-
side examining it

  we found that though it was as
slender as my smallest finger the chain
was of incredible strength and when
we roughly estimated the extent of
its thick-coiled length we discovered
that it would be more than long
enough to reach from our window to
the street below at once therefore
we secreted the thing in a corner of
the room and impatiently awaited the
sleep-period avhen we could work
without fear of interruption
the star-stealers



  at last after what seemed measure-
less hours of waiting the great horns
blared forth across the city outside
and swiftly its streets emptied the
sounds in our building quieting until
all was silence except for the
humming of a few watchful cones
above the great condenser and the
deep droning of the condenser itself
in the distance at once we set to
work at the bars of our window

  frantically we chipped at the rock
at the base of one of the metal bars
using the few odd bits of metal at our
command but at the end of two hours
had done no more than scratch away
a bare inch of the glowing stone an-
other hour and we had laid bare from
the rock the lower end of the bar but
now we knew that within minutes the
sleep-period of the city outside would
be ending and into its streets would
be swarming its gliding throngs
making impossible all attempts at
escape furiously we worked drip-
ping now with sweat until at last
when our thne-dials showed that less
than half an hour remained to its i
gave over the chipping at the rock and
wrapped our chain firmly around the
lower end of the bar we had loosened
then stepping back into the cell and
bracing ourselves against the wall
below the window we pulled back-
ward with all our strength

  a tense moment we strained thus
the thick bar holding fast and then
abruptly it gave and fell from its
socket in the wall to the floor with a
loud ringing clang we lay in a
heap on tlie floor panting and listen-
ing for any sound of alarm then rose
and swiftly fastened the chains end
to one of the remaining bars the
chain itself we dropped out of the
window watching it uncoil its length
down the mighty buildings glowing
side until its end trailed on the empty
glowing street far below at once i
motioned hurus iiol to the window
and in a moment he had squeezed
through its bars and was sliding

slowly down the chain hand under
hand before he was ton ieet down
dal nara was out and creeping down-
ward likewise and then i too
squeezed through the window and
followed them downward the three
of us crawling down the chain along
the huge buildings steeply sloping
side like three flies

  i was ten feet down from the
window now twenty feet and
glanced down toward the glowing
empty street five hundred feet below
and seeming five thousand then at
a sudden sound from above me i
looked sharply up and as i did so
the most sickening sensation of fear
i had ever experienced swept over
me for at the window we had iust
left twenty feet above me one of the
tentacle-creatures was leaning out
brought to our cell i doubted not by
the metal bars ringing fall his white
red-rimmed eye turned full upon me

  i heard sighs of horror from my
two companions beneath me and for
a single moment we hung motionless
along the chains length swinging
along the huge pyramids glowing
side at a height of hundreds of feet
above the shining streets below then
the creature raised one of its ten-
tacles a metal tool in its grasp which
he brought down in a sharp blow on
the chain at the windows edge
again he repeated the blow and
again

   iiv was cutting  chain



for a space of seconds t hung
motionless there and then as the
tool in the grasp of the creature
above came down  the chain in an-
other sharp blow the sound gal-
vanized me into sudden action

  slide  down i cried they
didnt however but followed me up
the chain though dal nara and i
alone came to grips with the horrible
dead-star creature i gripped the


weird tales

links with frantic hands pulling my-
self upward toward the window and
the creature at the window twenty
feet above me

  three times the tool in his hand
came down upon the chain while i
struggled up toward him and each
time i expected the strand to sever
and send us down to death hut the
hard metal withstood the blows for
the moment and before he could strike
at it again i was up to the level of
the window and reaching up toward
him

  as i did so swift black tentacles
thrust out and gripped dal nara and
me while another of the snaky arms
swept up with the tool in its grasp for
a blow on my head before it could
fall though i had reached out with
my right hand holding to the chain
with my left and had grasped the
body of the thing inside the window
pulling him outside before he had
time to resist as i did so my own
hold slipped a little so that we hung
a few feet below the window both
clinging to the slender chain and both
striking futilely at each other he with
the metal tool and i with my clenched
fist

  a moment we hung there swaying
hundreds of feet above the luminous
stone street and then the creatures
tentacles coiled swiftly around my
neck tightening choking me hang-
ing precariously to our slender strand
with one hand i struck out blindly
with the other but felt consciousness
leaving me as that remorseless grip
tightened then with a last effoit i
gripped the chain firmly with both
hands doubled my feet under me and
kicked out with all my strength the
idck caught the cone-body of my op-
ponent squarely tearing him loose
from his own hold on the chain and
then there was a sudden wrench at my
neck and i was free of him while be-
neath dal nara and i glimpsed his
dark body whirling down toward the
street below twisting and turning in

its fall along the buildings slanting
side and then crashing finally down
upon the smooth shining street below
avhere it lay a black little huddled
mass

  hanging there i looked down pant-
ing and saw that hurus hoi had
reached the chains bottom and was
standing in the empty street await-
ing us glancing up i saw that the
blows of the creature i had fought
had half severed one of the links
above me but there was no time to
readjust it so with a prayer that it
might hold a few moments longer
dal nara and i began our slipping
sliding progress downward

  the sharp links tore our hands
cruelly as we slid downward and
once it seemed to me that the chain
gave a little beneath our weight ap-
prehensively i looked upward then
down to where hurus hoi was
waving encouragement down down
we slid not daring to look beneath
again not knowing how near we
might be to the bottom then there
was another slight give in the chain
a sudden grating catch and abruptly
the weakened link above snapped and
we dropped headlong downward-
ten feet into the arms of hurus iiol

  a moment we sprawled in a little
heap there on the glowing street and
then staggered to our feet out of
the city cried hurus hoi we
could never get to the condenser-
switch on foot-but in the cruiser
theres a chance and we have but a
few minutes now before the sleep-
period ends

  down the broad street we ran iioav
through squares and avenues of glow-
ing mighty pyramids crouching
down once as the ever-hovering cones
swept by above and then racing on
at any moment i knew the great
horns might blare across the city
bringing its swarming thousands into
its streets and our only chance was
to win free of it before that happened

indiscriminate conversation and the
shrill piping overtones of womens
laughter on the cleared daneing-

of shapely young women in costumes
consisting principally of beads and
glittering rhinestones danced hec-
tically their bare powdered arms
legs and torsos gleaming in the glare
of the spotlight the close super-
heated air reeked with the odor of
broken food and the effluvia from
womens perfumed gowns and bodies
while the savage heathen snarl of the
jazz bands jungle music throbbed
and palpitated like a fever patients
pulses soft fronds of particolored
silk sweeping gracefully down from
the center of the ceiling formed a
tentlike roof which billowed grace-

fighting for possession of his hard-

  something like a smile flickered
across the cruel arrogant lips of the

apparent that the discovery of de

thing needed to make her happiness

you boys from across the pond
simply must have your little nip
mustnt you fix it ill tell the
avorld i can leave it to mamma
shell see you get a shot thatll start
your blood circulatin back in a
minute frencliy and by the way  -
she paused a genial smile on her
broad rather homely face-how
about a little playmate to liven things
up someone to share the loneliness
of a stranger in a strange land i
got just the little lady to do the trick
shes from over the avater too

  mordieu my friend it seems i
have put my foot in it up to the

grimace of comic tragedy my
request for a drink brings us not only

the liquor but a partner to help
consume it it would seem two
hundred francs at the least this will
cost us i fear

  i was about to voice a protest for
supping at a night club was one
thing while consorting with the paid
entertainers was something very
different but my remonstrances died
half uttered for the hostess bore
down upon us her face wreathed in
smiles a waiter with a long-necked
bottle preceding her and a young
woman-dark pretty and with an air
of shy timidity-following docilely in
her wake the girl-she was little
more-wore a rich black fur coat
over a black evening gown and swung
a small black grosgrain slipper bag
from her left wrist

 shake hands with mamselle
mutina frenchy the hostess bade
shes just as lonesome and thirsty
as you are youll get along like
mocha and java you two

  enchante mademoiselle de
grandin assured her as lie raised her
slender white fingers to his lips and
withdrew a chair for her you will
have a bit of food some champagne

perhaps some-- he rattled on

with a string of gallantries worthy of
a professional boulevardier while 
watched him in mingled fascination
and disapproval this was a facet of
the many-sided little frenchman i
had never seen before and i was not
especially pleased with it

  our table-mate seated herself
letting her opulent coat fall back over
her chair and revealing a pair of
white rounded shoulders and arms of
singular loveliness her eyes rested
on the table in timid confusion as
de grandin monopolized the conver-
sation i studied her attentively
there was no doubting her charm
slim youthful vibrant she was yet
restrained with a sort of patrician
calm her skin was not the dead
avhite of the powder-filmed per-
formers of the cabaret nor yet the
pink of the athletic womans rather

it seemed to glow with a delicate
undertone of tan like the old ivory
of ancient chinese carvings or the
richest of cream her face was heart-
shaped rather than oval with almost
straight eyebrows of jetty blackness
a small straight nose and a low
broad forehead blue-black hair that
lapped smoothly over her tiny ears
like folded ravens wings and
delicate sensitive lips which i knew
instinctively would have been lus-
ciously red even without the aid of
the rouge with which they were
tinted when she raised timid
troubled eyes to de grandins face i
saw the irises inside the silken frames
of curling black lashes were purple as
pansy petals humph i com-
mented mentally shes beautiful-
entirely too good-looking to be
respectable  

  the waiter brought a chicken sand-
wich and-to my unbounded astonish-
ment-a bottle of ginger ale for her
and as she was about to lift a morsel
of food to her lips i saw her purple
eyes suddenly widen with dread and
her cheeks go ash-pale with fright

   msieu she whispered leaning
impulsively across the table do not
look at once i implore you but in a
moment glance casually at the table
at the far corner of the room and tell
me if you see anyone theie

  restraining an impulse to wheel in
my chair i held myself steady a
moment then with elaborate uncon-
cern surveyed the room slowly at
the table indicated by the girl sat
four men in dinner clothes leanness
-the cadaverous emaciation of dis-
secting-room material-was their out-
standing characteristic their cheeks
were gaunt and hollow their lips so
thin that the outline of the teeth
could be marked through them and
every articulation of their skulls
could be traced through the tightly
stretched saddle-brown skin of their
faces but a seconds study of their
deaths-head countenances revealed a
more sinister feature their eyes


weird tales

were obliquely set like eats yellow-
green and cruel with long slits for
pupils changeless in expression they
were set fixed inscrutable pitiless
as any panthers-waiting watching
seeing all revealing nothing i
shuddered in spite of myself us i
forced my gaze to travel casually over
the remainder of the room

  de grandin was speaking in a low
suppressed whisper and in his little
round blue eyes there snapped and
sparkled the icy flashes which
betrayed excitement  mademoiselle
he said i see four monkey-faced
heathen seated at that table hindoos
they are by their features perhaps
berbers from africa but devils off-
spring by their eves which are like
razors do they annoy you i will
order them away i will pull their
crooked noses-pardieu i shall twist
their flap-ears before i boot them
from the place if you do but say the
word  

  oh no no the girl breathed
with a frightened shudder and i
could see it was as if a current of
cold horror something nameless and
terrible flowed from ihe strange men
to her do not appear to notice
them sir but-aristide she beck-
oned to a waiter hurrying past with
a tray of lasses

  yes mamseltc the man
answered pausing with a smile beside
her chair

  those gentlemen in the corner by
the orchestra-she nodded ever so
slightly toward the macabre group-
have you ever seen them here be-
fore   

  gentlemen mamselle the
waiter replied with a puzzled frown
as he surveyed the table intently
surely you make the joke with
aristide that table she are vacant
-the only vacant one in the place it
are specially reserved and paid for
but- 

  never mind the girl interrupted
with a smile and the man hurried off
on his errand

  you see she asked simply  

  bavbe dune poulc bleu but i do
not de grandin asserted but-

  hush she interrupted oh
do not let them think we notice them
it would make them frenzied when
the lights go out for the next num-
ber of the show i shall ask a great
favor of you sir you are a chiv-
alrous gentleman and will not refuse
f shall take a package from my hand-
bag-see i trust you perfectly-and
pass it to you beneath the table and
you will take it at once to  algon-
quin avenue and await me there
please her warm soft fingers
curled themselves about his hand
with an appealing pressure you
will do this for me you will not
fail-yoix are not afraid

  mademoiselle lie assured her
solemnly returning her handclasp
with compound interest i shall do
it though forty thousand devils and
devilkins bar the way

  as the lights in the big central
chandelier dimmed and the spotlight
shot its effulgence over the dancing-
tloor a petite blond maiden arrayed
in silver trunks bandeau and slippers
pranced out between the rows of
tables and began singing in a rasping
nasal voice while she strutted and
jiggled through the intricate move-
ments of the baltimore

 come friend trowbridge
ordered de grandin abruptly stowing
something in his pocket at the same
time we go we leave allez-vous-
en

  i	followed stumblingly through the
comparative darkness of the dining-
room but paused on the threshold for
a final backward glance the zone of
spotlight on the daneing-floor made
the remainder of the place inky black
by contrast and only the highlights
of the table napery the mens shirt-
fronts and the womens arms and
shoulders showed indistinctly through
the gloom but it seemed to me the
oblique unchanging eyes of the
sinister quartet at the corner table
the devil-people



followed us through the dark and
shone with sardonic phosphorescence
as the questing eyes of hungry cats
spy out the movements of mice among
the shadows

nphts is the craziest thing youve
ever done i scolded as our
taxi gathered speed over the slippery
street what do we know about that
girl nothing except shes an
habitue of a none too reputable night
club she may be a dope peddler for
all we know and this may be just a
scheme to have us carry her contra-
band stuff past the police or it may
be a plan for hold-up and robbery
and those devilish-looking men her
accomplices id not put any sort of
villainy past a gang like that

and--

  de grandin s slender mocha-
gloved fingers beat a devils tattoo on
the silver knob of his ebony cane as
he regarded me with a fixed unwink-
ing stare of disapproval all that
you say may be true my friend he
admitted nevertheless i have a
mind to see this business through
are you with me

  of course but-

  there are no buts cher ami un-
less i mistake rightly we shall see
remarkable things before we have
done and i would not miss the sight
for half a dozen peaceful nights in
bed 

  as we rounded a corner and turned
into the wide tree-bordered roadway
of algonquin avenue another car
sped past us through the storm
whirling skid-chains snarling savage-
ly against its mudguards



areal estate agents sign an-
nounced that the substantial
brownstone residence which was 
algonquin avenue was for side or
rent on long-term lease and would be
altered to suit the tenant otherwise
the place was as much like every other

house in the block as one grain of rice
is like the others in a bag

  hastening up the short flagstone
path leading from the sidewalk de
grandin mounted the low brownstone
stoop felt uncertainly a moment
located the old-fashioned pull-door-
bell and gave the brass knob a
vigorous yank

  through the mosaic of brightly
stained glass in the front door panel
we could descry a light in the hall
but no footsteps came in answer to
our summons morbleu this is
villainous the little frenchman
muttered as an especially vicious puff
of wind hurled a barrage of sleet into
his face are we to stand here till
death puts an end to our sufferings
i will not have it he struck a
resounding blow on the door with the
knob of his walking-stick

  as though waiting only the
slightest pressure the unlatched door
swung back beneath the impact of his
cane and we found ourselves staring
down a long high-ceiled hall under
the flickering light of an old-
fashioned prism-fringed gas chande-
lier we glimpsed the riotous colors of
the oriental rugs with which the
place was carpeted caught a flash of
king-blue rose and rust-red from the
sumptuous prayer cloth suspended
tapestrywisc on the wall but gave no
second glance to the draperies for at
the far end of the passage was that
which brought an excited a-a-ahf
from de grandin and a gasp of horror
from me

 the place was a shambles
hunched forward like a doll with a
broken back an undersized dark-
skinned man in white drill jacket
batik sarong and yellow turban
squatted in a low blackwood chair
and stared endlessly before him into
infinity with the glazed half-plead-
ing half-expressionless eyes of the
newly dead a smear of red wider
than the palm of a mans hand and
still slowly spreading disfigured the


weird tales

left breast ox his white jacket and told
the reason for his death

  half-way up the stairway which
curved from the farther end of the
hall another man similarly attired
had fallen backward apparently in
the act of flight and lay against the
stair-treads like a worn-out tailors
dummy carelessly tossed upon the
carpet his bare brown feet oddly
bent on flaccid ankles pointed up-
ward head and hands lolling down-
ward with an awful awkwardness
were toward xis and i went sick with
horror at sight of the open gasping
mouth and set staring eyes in the
reversed face under his back-bent
chin a terrific wound gaped in his
throat like the butchers mark upon a
slaughtered sheep

  grand dim de grandin mur-
mured surveying the tragic relics a
moment they were thorough those
assassins

  darting down the corridor he
paused beside the corpses letting his
hand rest on each a moment then
turned away with a shrug dead
comme un mouton he observed
almost indifferently but not long so
my friend they are still soft and
warm if we could but-dieu de
dim-another oh villainous mon-
strous  infamous  

  stepping through an arched door-
way we had entered a large room to
the left of the hall a carved black-
wood divan stood at the apartments
farther end and a peacock screen
immediately behind it a red-shaded
lamp threw its softly diffused light
over the place mellowing to some
extent the dreadful tableau spread
before us full length among the
gaudy heaped-up pillows of the divan
a woman reclined indolently one
bare brown arm extended toward us
wrist bent hand drooping a long
thin cheroot of black tobacco held
listlessly between her red-stained
fingers small she was almost
childishly so her skin golden as sun-
ripened fruit her lips red as though

stained with fresh pomegranate juice
and on the loose robe of sheer yellow
muslin which was her only garment
glowed a redder stain beneath the
gentle swell of her left bosom death
had been kinder to her than to the
men for her large black-fringed eyes
were closed as though in natural
sleep and her lips were softly parted
as if she had gently sighed her life
away the illusion of slumber was
heightened by the fact that on the
henna-stained tees of one slender foot
was balanced a red-velvet slipper
heavily embroidered with silver
thread while its mate had fallen to
the floor as though listlessly kicked
off by its wearer

  treading softly as though passing
the sanctuary of a church the little
frenchman approached the dead
woman felt her soft rounded aim a
moment then pinched daintily at the
cheroot between her dead fingers
parblcu yes he nodded vig-
orously it was recent most recent
friend trowbridge the vile mis-
creants who did this deed of shame
had but just gone when we arrived
for see her flesh still glows with the
warmth of life and the memory of its
fire still lingers in this cigars
tobacco not more than ten nor eight
nor scarcely six minutes can have
passed since these poor ones were
done to death

  eh men-he bent his left hand
palm upward consulting the tiny
watch strapped to the under side of
his wrist and turned toward the door
with a faint shrug-  anyone can
deplore these deaths it is for jules
de grandin to avenge them come
we must notify the gendarmes and
the coroner then-

  what about mademoiselle mu-
tina i asked maliciously you
promised to wait here for her you
know  

  he paused a moment regarding me
intently with his fixed level stare
precisement he assented grimly
what about her it remains to be
the devil-people



seen as for my promise-mordieu
when i was a little lad i promised
myself i should one day be president
of the republique but when i grew
to a mans estate i found too many
important things to do he swung
back the front door thrust his collar
up about his ears with a savage jerk
and strode across the low porch into
the howling storm

  what warned me to look up i shall
never know for the natural course to
have followed would have been that
taken by de grandin and bend my
head against the wind but a subtle
something something so tangible that
it was almost physical seemed to jerk
my chin up from my greatcoat collar
just in time prom the areaway
beneath the porch steps staring at the
retreating frenchman with a malig-
nancy utterly bestial was a pair of
oblique yellow-green eyes

 look out de grandin i
shrieked and even as i called i
realized the warning was too late for
an arm shot upward poising a dully
gleaming weajon-a dagger of some
sort i thought-for a throw

  scarcely conscious of my act i
acted throwing both feet forward i
slipped on the glassy sleet with which
the stone steps were veneered and
catapulted down them like a trunk
sweeping down a baggage-chute my
feet landed squarely against the
frenchmans  legs knocking him
sprawling and something whizzed
past my car with a deadly whirring
sound and struck against the flagstone
path beyond with a brittle crackling
clash

  fighting to regain my footing like
a cat essaying the ascent of a slate
gable i scrambled helplessly on the
sleet-glazed walk saw de grandin
right himself with an oath and dive
head-foremost toward the area where
his assailant lurked

 for an instant everything was
chaos i saw de grandin miss his
step and lurch drunkenly over the icy
footwalk saw his brown-skinned

assailant spring upon him like a
panther on its prey realized dimly
that someone had charged across the
narrow yard and sprung to my little
friends aid then was knocked fiat
once more by a vicious kick which
missed my face only a hairs breadth
and almost dislocated my shoulder

 catch him friend trowbridge-
he flies de grandin shouted dis-
engaging himself from his rescuers
arms and rushing futilely after his
fleeing opponent sure-footed as a
lynx the fellow ran over the slippery
pavement crossed the roadway and
bolted down the connecting street
disappearing from sight as though
swallowed up by the enveloping
storm

 merci bcaucoup monsieurde
grandin acltnowledged as he turned
to his deliverer   i have not the
honor of knowing your name but my
obligation is as great as your help was
timely if you will be so good as to-
trowbridge my friend catch him
he swoons

 quick friend trowbridge the
frenchman ordered do you impro-
vise some sort of bandage while i
seek conveyance we must bear him to
the house and staunch his wound else
he will bleed to death  

xthile de grandin sought fran-

  	 tically for a taxicab i opened
the strangers clothes and wadded my
handkerchief against the ugly knife-
wound in his upper arm crude and
makeshift as the device wtas it
stopped the flow of blood to some ex-
tent and while still unconscious the
man did not appear measurably worse
off when we arrived at my office some
twenty minutes later while i cut
away his shirt sleeve and adjusted a
proper pad and bandage de grandin
was busily telephoning our gruesome
discoveries to police headquarters

  a stiff drink of brandy and water
forced between his lips brought a
semblance of color back to the faint-
ing mans cheeks he turned his head


weird tales

slowly on  he pillow of the examina-
tion table and muttered something
unintelligible then with a start lie
lose to a sitting posture and cried
mutina dear love it is i-richard

wait mutina wait a -

  as it a curtain had been lifted
from before his eyes lie saw us and
turned from one to the other with
an expression of blank bewilder-
ment where-how- he began

dazedly then oh i remember
that devil was assaulting you and 

rushed in to-

  to save a total stranger from
a most unpleasant predicament
monsieur for which the stranger
greatly thanks you de grandin
supplied and now if you are feel-
ing somewhat better will you not be
good enough to take another drink-
somewhat larger this time if you
please-of this so excellent brandy
then tell us why you call  ma-
demoiselle mutina it so happens
that we too have much interest in
that young lady

 who are you the youth
demanded with sharp suspicion

  i am jules de grandin doctor of
medicine and of the faculty of the
sorbonne and sometime special agent
of the surd general and this is dr
samuel trowbridge my very good
friend and host the frenchman
returned with a formal bow while
saving my life from that miserable
execrable rogue who would have
assassinated me you received an ugly
wound and we brought you here to
dress it and now that social
amenities are completed perhaps you
will have the goodness to answer my
question concerning mademoiselle
mutina who may i ask is she
and what is it you know of her be-
lieve me young sir it is not from idle
curiosity but in the interest of
justice that we ask

  she is my wife the young man
answered after a moments thought-
ful silence in which he seemed to
weigh the advisability of speaking

i am richard starkweather-per-
haps you know my father dr trow-
bridge-lie turned to me-he was
president of t lie old harrisonville
street railway before the public
service took it over

  i nodded yes i remember him

 replied he was two classes ahead
of me at amherst but we met at

alumni gatherings and-

  never mind the reminiscences
friend trowbridge de grandin
interrupted his logical french mind
refusing to lie swerved from the
matter in hand you were about to

tell us monsieur- he paused

significantly glancing at our patient
with raised quizzical eyebrows

 i married mutina in sabuah

sulu then again in manila but-

 parbleu-you did marry her
twice de grandin demanded in-
credulously how comes it
starkweather took a deep breath
like a man about to dive into a cold
stream then

  i met mutina in sabuah sulu
he began possibly you gentlemen
have read my book malay pirates as
i knew them and wondered how i
became so intimately acquainted with
the engaging scoundrels the fact is
it was all a matter of luck the
dutch tram steamer willi dm ina on
which i was going from batavia to
manila put in at lubuah and thats
how it began we all went ashore to
see the place which was only a
cluster of chinese yodowns a dozen
or so european business places and a
couple of hotels of sorts we saw all
we wanted of the dried-mud-and-sand
town in a couple of hours but as the
ship wasnt pushing out until some-
time in the early morning several of
us looked in on a honky-tonk which
was in full blast at one of the saloons
i dont know what it was they gave
me to drink but it was surely power-
ful medicine-probably- a mixture of
crude white rum and nyapi-what-
ever it was it affected me as no west-
ern liquor ever did and i was dead
the devil-people



to the world in three drinks the
next thing i remember was waking
up the following morning well after
sun-up to find myself with empty
pockets and a dreadful headache
floating out of sight of land in a
chinese sampan i havent the
faintest idea how i got there though
i suspect the other members of the
party were too drunk to miss me when
they put back for the ship and the
proprietor of the dive seeing me
sprawled out there improved his
opportunity to go through my
pockets then lugged me to the water-
front dumped me into the first empty
boat he found and let me shift for
myself maybe he cut me adrift
maybe the boats painter came untied
by accident at any rate there i
was washed out to sea by the ebbing
tide with no water no food and not
the slightest idea where i was or how
far away the nearest land lay

  i had barely sense and strength
left to set the sampans matting sail
before i fell half conscious into the
bottom again still so sick and weak
with liquor that i didnt care partic-
ularly whether i ever made land
again

  just how long i lay there asleep
-drugged would be a better term
for that eastern liquor acts more like
opium than alcohol-i havent the
slightest idea certainly it was all
day perhaps i slept clear around the
clock when i awoke the stars were
out and the boat was drifting side-on
toward a rocky jagged shore as if
she were in a mill-flume

  i jumped up and snatched the
steering paddle striving with might
and main to bring her head around
but i might as well have tried
paddling a canoe with a teaspoon
she drove straight for those rocks as
if some invisible hand were guiding
her to destruction then just as i
thought i was gone a big wave
caught her squarely under the poop
lifted her over a saw-toothed reef and
deposited her on a narrow sandy

shingle almost as gently as if shed
been beached by professional sailors

  i climbed out as quickly as i
could and staggered up the beach but
fell before id traversed a quarter-
mile the next thing i knew it was
daylight again and a couple of ugly-
looking malays were standing over
me talking in some outlandish
tongue apparently arguing whether
to kill me then or wait a while i sup-
pose the only thing which saved me
was the fact that theyd already been
through my pockets and decided that
as i had nothing but the tattered
clothes i lay in ny live body was
more valuable than my wardrobe
anyhow they prodded me to my feet
with a spear butt and drove me along
the beach for almost an hour

  we finally came to a little horse-
shoe-shaped cleft in the shore and
just where the sandy shingle met the
jungle of lalang grass was a village
of half a hundred or so white huts
clustering about a much larger house
one of my captors pointed toward the
bigger building and said something
about  kapal besar which i assumed
to be the name of the village head-
man

  he was more than that he was
really a sort of petty sultan and
ruled his little principality with a rod
of iron notwithstanding he was
nearly ninety years old and a hopeless
paralytic

  when we got into the village i
saw the big house was a sort of
combined palace and fortress for it
was surrounded by a high wall of
sun-dried brick loopboled for cannon
and musketry and with three or four
pieces of ancient ordnance sticking
their brass muzzles through the
apertures the wall was topped with
an abatis of sharpened bamboo stakes
and a man armed with a civil war
model musket and bayonet stood
guard at the gateway through which
my finders drove me like a pig on its
way to market
s

weird tales

  inside the encircling wall was a
space oil smooth sand perhaps ten or
twelve feet broad then a wide brick-
floored piazza roofed over with beams
of teak as thick as railway ties laid
close together on equally heavy
stringers and from the porch opened
any number of doorways into the
house

 my guards led or drove me
through one of these and down a tiled
corridor while a half-naked boy who
popped up out of the darkness like
a jack-in-the-box from his ease ran on
ahead yelling kapal bcsar-hai
kapal tuan at the top of his shrill
nasal voice

  iwas surprized at the size of the
room to which i was taken it
was roughly oval in shape quite fifty
feet long by twenty-five or thirty at
its greatest width and paved with
alternate black and red tiles the
roof which rose like a sugar-loaf in
the center was supported on a-beams
resting on columns of skinned palm-
tree boles and to these were nailed
brackets from which swung red-glass
bowls filled with coconut-oil with a
floating wick burning in each the
result was the place was fairly well
illuminated and i had a good view
of the thin aged man sitting in a
chair of carved black wood at the
farther end of the chamber

  he was a cadaverous old fellow
seemingly almost bloodless with skin
 lie color of old parchment stretched
tight as a drumhead over his skull
thin pale lips and a long straggling
white beard sweeping over his tight
green jacket when he looked at me
i saw his eyes were light hazel al-
most gray and piercing and direct
as those of a hawk his thin high-
bridged nose reminded me of a
hawks beak too and the bony
almost transparent hands which
clutched and fingered the silver-
mounted bamboo cane in his lap
were like a hawks talons

 my two guards made profound

salaams but  contented myself with
the barest nod civility required

  the old chap looked appraisingly
at me while my discoverers ha-
rangued him at great length then
with an impatient motion of his cane
lie waved them to silence and began
addressing me in malayan i didnt
know a dozen words of the language
and made signs to him that i couldnt
understand whereupon lie switched
to an odd slurring sort of spanish
which i was able to make out with
some difficulty

  before hed spoken five minutes
i understood my status and was none
too delighted to learn i was regarded
as a legitimate piece of sea-salvage
-a slave in plain language if i had
any special talent  was informed
id better be trotting it out for dis-
play right off for lacking something
to recommend me for service in the
palace i would be forthwith shipped
off to the yam fields or the groves
where the copra was prepared

  i was at a loss just how to answer
the old duffer when  happened to see
a sort of guitar lying on the pavement
near the door leading to one of he
passages which radiated from the
audience chamber like wheel-spokes
from a hub snatching up the instru-
ment i tuned it quickly and pick-
ing some sort of accompaniment on
it began to sing ive a pretty fair
baritone and t put more into it that
day than t ever did with the college
glee club

   j-manila massas in dc cold cold
ground just a babys prayer at
twilight and over then went big
with the old man but hc song that
seemed to touch his heart was john
browns bodjj and i had to sing the
thing from beginning to end at least
a dozen times

   the upshot of it was that i found
myself permanently retained as court
minstrel had my torn white duds
replaced by a gorgeous red jacket and
yellow turban and a brilliantly
striped sarong and was assigned one
the devil-people



of the best rooms in the palace-
which isnt saying much from the
standpoint of modern conveniences

  the young man paused a moment
and despite his evident distress a
boyish grin spread over his lean
brown countenance my big chance
came when id been there about two
months he continued

  i prepped at st johns and put
in a full hitch with the infantry
during the war so the i  if and
the manuals of guard duty were as
familiar to me as the scriptures arc
to a ciicuit-riding preacher one day
when the disorganized mob old kapal
called his army were slouching
through their idea of a guard mount
i snatched his musket from the fellow
who acted as top sergeant and showed
em how to do the thing in proper
style the captain of the guard was
sore as a pup but old kapal was
sitting in the piazza watching the
drill and made em take orders from
me in half an hour i had them
presenting porting ordering and
shouldering arms in pretty fair
shape and in two weeks they could
do the whole manual go right by
squads and come on right into line as
snappily as any outfit you ever saw

 that settled it t was made
captain-general of the army wore
two swords and a brace of old-
fashioned brass-mounted powder and
ball revolvers in my waist shawl and
was officially known as ttiek-kard
tuan i taught the soldiers to salute
and the civil population took up the
custom in six months time f
couldnt go for a five-minute stroll
without gathering more salutes io the
yard than a newly commissioned
shavetail in the national army

  id managed to pick up a work-
ing knowledge of the language and
was seeing the people at first-hand
living their lives and almost thinking
their thoughts-that s where i got the
material for niv book thats how t
got mutina too

  one morning after drill kapal

besar called me into the audience
chamber and waved me to a seat i
was the only person on the island
privileged to sit in his presence by
he way

   my son he said i have been
thinking much of your future of late
in you  have found a very pearl
among men and it is my wish that
you rear strong sons to take your
place in the years to come mine too
mavhap for  have no men-children
to rule after me and there is none i
would rather have govern in my stead
when it shall have pleased allah
praised be his glorious name to
call me hence to paradise therefore
you shall have the choice of my
women forthwith lie clapped his
thin old hands in signal as he spoke
and a file of tittering giggling girls
sidled through one of the doors and
ranged themselves along the wall

  like all oriental despots kapal
besar maintained ihe droil <h>
tr iune it r rigidly-every woman who
pleased him was taken into his
seraglio though the old chap being
close to ninety and paralyzed from
the waist down for nearly twenty
years could be nothing more than
nominal husband to them of course

  marriage is simple in malaya and
divorce simpler thou art divorced
is all the husband need say to free
himself from an unwanted wife and
the whole thing is finished without
courts lawyers or fees

  i passed down the line of simper-
ing females wondering how i was
going to sidestep this latest honor
royalty had thrust upon me when i
came to mutina mutina signifies
the pearl in malayan and this girl
hadnt been misnamed believe me
or not gentlemen it was a case of
love at first sight as far as i was
concerned

  she was small even for a malay
girl-not more than four feet ten or
five feet tall at the most-with
smooth glossy black hair and the
tiniest feet and hands ive ever seeu


weird tales

though she had gone unshod the
greater part ot her life her feet were
slender and high-arched as those of
a duchess of the bourbon court with
long straight toes and delicate
filbert-shaped nails and her hands
though used to the heavy work all
native women royal or not per-
formed were fine and tapering and
clean she was light-skinned too
really fairer than i for her llesh was
the color of ivory while i was deeply
sun-burned and what attracted me
to her more than anything else i
think her lips and teeth were un-
stained by betel-nut and there was no
smudge or snuff about her nostrils
as she stood there in her prim modest
malay costume her eyes modestly
cast down and a faint blush staining
her face she was simply ravishing i
felt my heart miss a beat as i paused
before her

  there was a sort of scandalized
buzz-buzz of conversation among the
women when i turned to kapal to
announce my choice and the old
fellow himself looked surprized for a
moment i thought he was going to
renege on his offer but it developed
he thought id made an unworthy
decision id noticed without think-
ing of it that the other women kept
apart from mutina and old kapal
explained the reason in a few terse
words she was it seemed anak
gam pang that is no one knew who
her father was and such a condition
is even more of a social handicap in
malaya than with us further she
was suspected of black magical
practises and kapal went so far as
to intimate she had secured the honor
of admission to the zenana by the use
of guna-guna or love potions of
course if i wanted her after all hed
said why the misfortune was mine-
but i was not to complain i hadnt
been fairly warned

  i told him i wanted her if shed
have me at which he let out a shrill
cackle of a laugh called her to the

foot of his throne and spoke so
quickly for a minute or so that i
couldnt follow him then waved us
all away saying he wanted to take his
siesta

t marched from the audience

  a chamber to my quarters feeling
pretty well satisfied it really had
been a case of love at first sight as
far as i was concerned and id made
up my mind to pay real courtship to
the lovely girl and try to induce her
to marry me for i was determined
that kapal besar or no kapal besar
id not have her as a gift from any-
one but herself

 as i entered my quarters and
turned to lay my swords on the couch
i was startled to see a form dart
across the threshold and drop crouch-
ing to the floor before me

  it was mutina her little soft
feet had followed me noiselessly down
the corridor and she must have been
at my heels when i entered the room

   kakasih she said as she knelt
before me and drew aside her veil
revealing her blushing face laki
kakasih amba anghu mcmuji-hus-
band beloved i adore thee 

  gentlemen did you ever take a
drink of rich old sherry and feel its
avarming gloav creep through every
vein and nerve in your body tliat
avas the way i felt avhen i realized
what had happened the rigmarole
old kapal reeled off in the throne-
room avas a combined divorce-and-
marriage ceremony mutina was my
wife and-my heart raced like a
coasting motor cars engine-with her
own soft lips she had declared her
loare

 three weeks later they found
kapal besar dead in his great carved
chair and fear that i would seize the
government almost precipitated a
riot but avhen i told em i avouldnt
have the throne as a gift and wanted
nothing but a prau and crew to take
mutina and me to the philippines
the devil-people




they dam near forced the crown 
me in gratitude

 two members of tlie guard
hussein and batjan with jobita
husseins young wife asked per-
mission to accompany us so there was
a party of five which set out in the
prau amid the cheers of the army and
the booming of the one of kapals
brass cannon which could be fired

  young starkweather paused in his
narrative again and a sort of puz-
zled questioning expression spread
over his face the day before we
left he went on i came into the
quarters to get some stuff for the ship
and found mutina backed into a
corner fending off with both hands
the ugliest-looking customer id ever
seen he was a thin cadaverous
fellow with slanting yellow eyes and
a face like a walking corpse i saw
in a moment mutina was deathly
afraid of him and yelled  iiei badih
iang chelaka which may be freely
translated as get to hell out of here
you son of an ill-favored dog 

  instead of slinking away as any
other native would have done if
addressed that way by rick-kard
tuan the man just stood there and
grinned unpleasantly if you could
call his ugly grimace a grin

  sabuah sulu is a rough place
gentlemen and rough methods are the
rule there i snatched one of the
sabers from my cummerbund and cut
at him the fellow must have been
extraordinarily agile for though i
dont see how it happened i missed
him completely though id have
sworn my blade cut into his neck
that couldnt have been so though
for there was  resistance to the
steel and there the man stood un-
harmed after a slash which should
have lopped the head clean off his
shoulders

 mutina seemed more concerned
about my safety than the circum-
stances seemed to warrant for the
intruder was unarmed while i wore
two swords and a pair of pistols and

after hed slunk away with a final
menacing look she threw herself into
my arms and wept as if her heart
would break i comforted her as best
i could then ran out to ask the guard
who the mysterious man was but the
sentry swore by the teeth and beard
of allah that he had seen no stranger
enter or leave the compound that
day  

    u -a-a-ah    murmured jules
de grandin twisting furiously at the
ends of his little golden mustache
say on my friend this is of the
most decided interest

  we got to manila without much
trouble starkweather continued as
he shot a wondering look at the little
frenchman we passed through
the sulu sea landed on southern
luzon and completed the trip over-
land we were married with chris-
tian ceremonies by an army chaplain
at manila and i cabled home for
money then arranged passage for our
entire party

  coming back to the hotel after
making some last-minute sailing
arrangements i thought i noticed the
shifty-eyed johnny who annoyed
mutina the day before we left sabuah
sulu sneaking down the street and
it seemed to me he looked at me with
a malicious grin as he ducked around
the comer it couldnt have been
the same man of course but the
resemblance was striking and so was
the coincidence

  i felt a sort of premonition of
evil as i rushed up to our suite and
i was in a perfect frenzy of
apprehension when i opened the door
and found the rooms empty mutina
was gone so were hussein batjan
and jobita there wras no clue to
their whereabouts nothing to tell
why or where theyd gone nothing
at all but-this

  from an inside pocket he drew a
leather case and extracted a folded
sheet of note-paper from it he
passed it o de grandin wtho perused


weird tales

it quickly nodded once and handed
it to me a single line of odd un-
intelligible characters scrawled across
the sheet but i could make nothing
of them till starkweather translated

   s malayan  he explained the
same words she first spoke to me

laki kakasih amba anghau mcmuji
-husband beloved i adore thee

  i was like a crazy man for the
next two months the police did
everything possible to find mutina
and i hired a small army of private
detectives but we never got one trace
of any of the three

  finally i came home tried to
reconstruct my life as best i could
and wrote my book on the pirates as
 had known them

  just tonight i learned that
mutina accompanied by hussein and
jobita and batjan is living in
havrisonville and that shes an
entertainer at la pantoufle doree t
got her address in algonquin avenue
from one of  lie chib attendants and
rushed out there as fast as i could
just as i entered the yard i saw you
scuffling with someone and-believe
it or not-im sure the man who
assaulted you was the one i saw in
sabuah sulu and later in manila id
recognize those devilish eyes of his
anywhere on earth

  it was good of you gentlemen to
bring me here and patch me up
instead of sending me to the hos-
pital he concluded but im feel-
ing pretty lit again now and  must
he off men you dont realize
mutinas in that house and that
slant-eyed devils hanging around
ive got to go to her right awav t
must sec mutina

  then yell be after goin to th
jail an nowheres else im thinkin
me boy a heavy irish voice an-
nounced truculently from the con-
sulting-room door and defective
sergeant jeremiah costello strode
across the threshold

            

utina-in jail the young
man faltered unbelievingly
sure good an tight an where
else should she be returned the
detective with a nod to de grandin
and me  tis sorry i am ter come
sneakin in on yez like this gentle-
men he apologized but th office
sent me up to algonquin avenue hot-
foot when yer message wuz received
an after id made me arrest i
thought id best be coinin here ter
talk matters over wid yez th bell
didnt seem to ring when i pushed
th button an its a cruel cold night
outside so i let meself in seein as
how yer light wuz goin an i knew
yed be up an ready ter talk
assuredly de grandin assented
with a nod but how comes it
that you put mademoiselle-madame
mutina under arrest my friend
why-the big irishman looked
wonderingly at the little frenchman
-what else wuz hiere ter do dr de
grandin sor tvas yerself as saw
what a liowly slaughter-house theyd
made o her place an dead men-an
women-dont die widout help so
when th young woman comes rusliin
up ter th place in a taxi all out o
breath as ye might say hot as fire
ter be after gittin inside ter meet
someone why sez i to meself ah-ho
me gur-rl tis yerself an  no one else
as knows sum pin more about these
shenancgans than meets th naked
eye else ye wouldnt be so anxious
ter meet someone-wid never a livin
soul save th pore dead creatures in-
side th house ter meet at all at all
she started some cock-an-bull
story about havin a date wid a gent
whose name she didnt know at th
house-some foreign man he were
she said ill be bettin me sunday
boots he wuz a foreigner too-twas
no christian american who did those
bloody murders an ye can be sure o
that too savin yer presence dr de
grandin sor
the devil-people



  the little frenchman stroked his
tiny wheaten mustache caressingly
i agree with you mon cher ho
assented but the young ladys story
was not entirely of the gentleman
chicken and cow for it was i whom
she was to meet at her house it
was for the purpose of meeting her
that friend trowbridge and i went
there and found what we discovered
sergeant costello am i a fool

  howly mither no denied the
irishman if they wuz more fools
like you in th wor-rld dr de
grandin sox wed be after havin
fewer funny houses ter keep th
nitwits in im thinkin

  precisely de grandin assented
  but i tell you mon brave madame
mutina not only did not commit those
killings she suspected nothing of
them consider is it likely she
would have made an assignation with
friend trowbridge and me had she
thought we would find evidences of
murder there

  costello shook his head

  trcs bon again  it was twenty-
one minutes past  when friend
trowbridge and i left her at la
pantoufle doree it was not later than
half-past when we arrived at her
house and the poor ones had not been
long dead when ave got there-their
flesh was warm and there was still
heat in the murdered womans cigar
but they had been dead from ten to
filteen minutes though not much
longer nevertheless if we avere with
madame mutina nine minutes before
she could not have been present at the
killing

  but she might a known sumpin
about it the irishman persisted

  i doubt it much at the night
club both friend troavbridge and i
saav several most unbeautiful men
avho frightened her greatly it was
at sight of them she entrusted some
object to me and begged i go to her
home arith all speed there to await
her coming as avc drove through

the storm on our errand another car
passed us avith great swiftness
whether the four unlovely ones rode
in it  not i can not say but i
believe they did in any event as we
left the house after vicaving the
murdered bodies a man closely
resembling one of them attacked me
from behind and had it not been for
good brave friend troavbridge and
this so excellent young man here
jules de grandin would hoav be
happy in heaven-i hope

  as it is-he seized the pointed
tips of his mustache in a sudden
fierce grip and taviijted them till i
thought he avould tear the hairs loose
-as it is i still live and there is
earthly avork to do come let us go
let us hasten let us repair imme-
diately to the jail where i may inter-
view the unfortunate beautiful
madame mutina

  no my friend he denied as
starkaveather aarould have risen to
accompany us it is better that you
remain away for a time me i shall
undertake that no harm comes to
your lady but for the purposes i
have in mind i think it best she sees
you not for a time be assured i
shall give you leave to greet her at
the earliest possible moment

t  is chin thrust moodily into the
- upturned collar of his greatcoat
the little frenchman sat beside me in
silence as i drove him and costello
toward policc headquarters as ave
rounded a corner driving cautiously
to avoid skidding over the sleety
pavement he seemed suddenly to
arrive at a decision through tun-
laav street if you please good
friend he ordered i avould stop
at the excellent bacigalupos for a
little minute

  at bacigalupos i echoed in
amazement why mike has been
in bed for hours

  then he must arise was the un-
compromising reply i avould do
the business avith him


weird tales

  no light burned in the windows of
thetiny hat where mike bacigalupo
lived above his prosperous fruit
stand but repeated rings at the bell
and poundings on the door finally
brought a sleepy and none too
amiable italian head from one of the
darkened openings  like an irate
tortoise peeping from its shell

  ilola my friend de grandin
hailed we are come to buy limes
jiave the goodness to put ten or a
dozen in a bag for us at once

  limas demanded the italian in
a shocked voice you wanta da
lima at half-pas  oclock you
come to hell-i not come down to
sell limas to benito mussolini deesa
time o night sapr-r-risii you
mus tinka me craze

  for answer de grandin broke into
a flood of rapid voluble italian
what lie said  do not know but five
minutes later he fruit merchant
shivering with cold inside the folds of
a red-hanncl bathrobe appeared at
the door and handed him a small
paper parcel more as we turned
away he waved his hand and called

 arriredcrci amico mio

   was burning with curiosity as we
drove toward headquarters but long
experience with the eccentric little
frenchman had taught me better
then to attempt to force his confi-
dence

  it was a frightened and pathetic
little figure the police matron ushered
into the headquarters room a few
minutes later  sit u she ex-
claimed piteously at sight of de gran-
din running forward and holding out
both slender ivory hands to him you
have come to save me from this
place

  more than that mu petit clitrc
i have come to save you from those
who persecute you if it please
heaven he replied soberly you
know not why you are arrested do
you

  	 n-no   she faltered  i came
from the club as quickly as  could
but this man and others seized me as
i alighted from my laxi they would
not let me enter my own house or see
my faithful friends oh msicu
make them let me see hussein and
batjan and jobita please

  mo puuvre de grandin replied
resting his hands gently on her
shoulders you can not see them ever
again those of whom we wot-they
arrived first  

  d-dead the girl stammered
half comprehendingy

  he nodded silently as he led her to
a seat then we must see that
others do not travel the same path
he added you yourself may be
their next target you are guilty of
no crime but perhaps it would be
safer were you to remain here

until--

  as he spoke never taking his eyes
from hois he rummaged about in
his overcoat pocket and suddenly
snatched his hand out crushing one
of the limes we had obtained from
bacigalupo between his long decep-
tively slender fingers the pale-gold
rind broke beneath his pressure and
a stream of amber juice spurted
through the rent spattering on the
girls bare arm

  -o-o-oh-ui ai she screamed
as the acid liquid touched her flesh
then writhed away from him as
though the lime juice had been burn-
ing oil

  a-lice she gave the shrill
piercing mourning cry of the east as
her eyes fastened on the glistening
spots of moisture on her forearm and
their round pupils suddenly drew in
and shrank to slits like those of a cat
coming suddenly into a darkened
room from the light

  jiien-ires bon de grandin
exclaimed snatching a silk handker-
chief from his cuff and drying her
arm i am sorry truly sorry my
i

the devil-peopije



poor one believe me sooner would
jules de grandin suffer torture than
muse you pain but it was necessary
that i do it see it is all well now
but it was not all well where the
gushing lime juice had struck her
tender flesh there was a cluster of
ugly red weals on the girls arm as
though her white soft skin were
scalded



tor a moment they faced each other

	in silence the alert blond
frenchman and the magnolia-white
eastern girl and mutual understand-
ing shone in their eyes

 how-how did you know she
faltered

     i did not know my little one   de
grandin confessed in a low voice
but what i learned tonight caused
me to suspect ilslas i was only too
right in my surmise

  he gazed thoughtfully at the
prison floor his narrow chin tightly
gripped between his thumb and fore-
finger then

  are you greatly attached to the
prophet my child he asked
would you consent to christian
baptism

  she looked at him in bewilderment
as she replied of course is not the
man of my heart of the nazarones
if it so be they go endlessly to be
companions of hell-fire as the
prophet on whom be peace
declares in the book of imrans
family then let mutinas face be
blackened too at the last great day
and let her go to everlasting torment
with the man she loves i ask nothing
better in the hereafter than to share
his torture if torture be his portion
but in this life it is written that i
must keep far away else i bring on
him the vengeance of-

 enough de grandin inter-
rupted almost sternly sergeant we
must release madame mutina in-

stantly come i am impatient to
take her hence trowbridge my
friend do you engage a clergyman at
once and have him at the house with-
out delay it is of importance that
we act with speed

  mutina had been booked for deten-
tion only as a material witness and it
was not difficult for costello to pro-
cure her release in five minutes they
had left for my house in a taxicab
while  drove toward saint lukes
rectory intent on dragging the
reverend leon barley from his bed

 with the clergyman in tow t
entered the study an hour later find-
ing dc grandin mutina and costello
talking earnestly but starkweather
nowhere in sight why where
is- i began but the french-
mans uplifted finger cut my question
off half uttered

  it is better that we name no
names at present friend trow-
bridge he warned then to dr
barley

  this young lady has the desire for
baptism man pcrc you will officiate
forthwith  dr trowbridge and i
will stand sponsors  

  why its a little unusual the
pastor began but de grandin in-
terrupted with a vigorous nod of his
bead pnrbleu it is more unusual
than you can suppose he agreed
it is with the unusual wc have to
deal tonight my friend and the un-
godly as well come do us your
office and do it quickly for be assured
we have not dragged you from the
comfort of your bed for nothing this
night

  the reverend leon barley pious
man of god and knowing man of the
world was not the sort of carping
stickler for the purity of ecclesiastical
rules who easts discredit on the
clergy though uninformed concern-
ing the ceremony he realized haste
was necessary and adjusted his stole
with the deft quickness learned from
service with the a e f and before
that in the philippine insurrection


weird tales

  swiftly the beautiful dignified
service proceeded

  wilt thou then obediently keep
gods holy will and commandments
and walk in the same all the days of
thy life asked dr barley

   will by gods help murmured
mutina softly

 mutina-dr barleys hand
dipped into the minton salad bowl of
water standing on the table and
sprinkled a few drops on the girls
bowed head-i baptize tliee in the

name of the-

  the solemn pronouncement was
drowned in a terrible blood-chilling
scream for as the sacramental
water touched her head mutina fell
forward to the floor and lay there
writhing as though in mortal agony

  gawd amighty cried costello
hoarsely  tis th divils wor-rk
fer sure

  sang de dieu cried jules de
grandin bending above the prostrate
girl look friend trowbridge for
the love of good god look

  face downward clawing at the
rugs and seemingly convulsed in un-
supportable torture lay mutina and
the gleaming black hair sleekly
parted on her small head was turning
snovnj white before our eyes

     great heavens what is it    asked
the minister unsteadily

  the girls hysterical movements
ceased is de grandin held a glass of
aromatic ammonia and water to her
lips and she whimpered softly as her
head rolled weakly in the crook of his
elbow

  for a moment he regarded her
solicitously then as he helped her to
a chair he turned to the clergyman
it would seem the devil makes much
ado about being cheated of a victim
he remarked almost casually this
poor one was the inheritor of a curse
with which she had no more to do
than the xxnboru child with the color
of his fathers hair eh lnen i have
that upstairs which will do more to

revive her body and spirit than all
the eau benite in all the worlds

  tiptoeing to the stairs he called
richard-richard my friend come
down forthwith and see what we have
brought  

  tlieie was a pounding of feet on
the steps a glad wondering cry from
the study door and richard stark-
weather and mutina his wife were
locked in each others arms

  come away quickly my friends
de grandin ordered in a sharp
whisper as he motioned us from the
room it is a profanation for our
eyes to look on their reunion anon
we must interrupt them for there is
much to be said and much more to
be done but this moment is theirs
and theirs alone 

fros of us gathered in my draw-
ing-room after dinner the follow-
ing evening sergeant costello
mellowed with the effects of an ex-
cellent meal several glasses of fifteen-
year-old liqueur chartreuse and the
fragrant fumes of an hoyo de
monterey lolled in the whig chair to
the right of the ciackling log fire
richard and mutina starkweather
fingers entwined occxxpied the loxxnge
before the fireplace while i sat
opposite costello in the center
back to the blaze small blue eyes
flashing and dancing with excitement
tiny waxed mustache quivering like
the whiskers of an irritable tom-cat
jules de grandin stood with his feet
well apart eyeing xxs ift iapid succes-
sion obseive my friends he
commanded thrusting his hand into
the inside pocket of his dinner coat
and fishing oxxt a newspaper stone-
proof some four inches by eiglxt
inches in size is it not the grand
surprize i have prepared for our evil-
eyed friends

 with a grandiloquent bow he
handed me the paper bidding me
the devil-people



read it aloud in boldface type the
notice announced

chez la pantoufle dorse

engagement extraordinary

the sensation of the year

la belle mutina former high priestess of
the rakshasas
will positively appear at this club
during the supper hour
tomorrow night

la mutina far-famed malayan beauty
will perform the notorious
dance of the indong
mutina
disclosing for the first time
in the western hemisphere
the devilish rites of the
rakshasas

reservations for this extraordinary attrac-
tion will positively not be received
by mail or telephone

  i	glanced at mutina sitting
demurely beside her husband then at
the exuberant little frenchman
all right what does it mean i
asked

  ah my friends what does it not
mean he replied with a wave of his
hand attend me-carefully if you
please

  last night at the club when the
good madame took pity on us and
lightened our darkness with the love-
ly presence of madame mutina i was
enchanted when madame mutina
invited our attention to the pussy-
faced evil ones seated at the corner
table i was enraged when we pro-
ceeded to madame mutinas house and
beheld the new-dead stretched so
quietly and pitifully there their
spilled blood crying aloud to heaven
-and me-for vengeance parblcu i
was greatly interested

   my friends the little feet of jules
de grandin have covered much terri-
tory where the eternal snows of the
northland fly forever before the cease-
less gales i have been there where
the sun bums and burns like the
fires of the fundamentalists hell
there have i been nowhere no land
is a stranger to me and on my many

travels i have kept my mind my eyes
and my ears widely open ah i have
heard the muted mumblings of the
dwellers round sierra leone when
the frightened blacks crouch in their
cabins and scarce breathe the name of
the human leopards for fear of dread-
ful vengeance in haiti i have be-
held the unclean rites of voudois and
witnessed the power of papaloi and
mamaloi the djinns and efreets of
araby the dracus werewolves and
vampires of hungary russia and
rumania the bhuts of india-i know
them all also i have been in the
malay archipelago and know the
rakshasas certainly

  consider my friends there is
no wonder-tale which affrights man-
kind after the lights are lit which has
not its foundation in present or past
fact the legends of the loves of
zeus with mortal women his liaisons
with danae io and europa they are
but ancestral memories of the bad old
days when wicked immortals-incubi
if you please-worked their evil will
on humanity in the middle ages
when faith burned more brightly than
at present men saw more clearly re-
call the story of robert le diable
scion of bertha a human woman and
bertramo a foul fiend disguised as a
worthy knight remember how this
misfortunate robert was the battle-
ground of his mothers gentle nature
and his sires fiendishness then con-
sider our poor madame mutina

  in malaya there exists a race of
beings since the beginning of the ages
known variously as the people of
antu or raksliasa they are inferior
fiends possessing not much of potent
magic for they are heavily admixed
with human half-breeds but at their
weakest they are terrible enough
they can in certain instances make
themselves invisible though only to
some people when visible the ma-
lays say they ean be recognized be-
cause of their evil eyes which are yel-
low-green and sharp as razors it was
such eyes i saw in the villainous faces


weird tales

of the ugly ones who frightened aia -
dame mutina at the club last night
even so i did not connect them with
t he wicked breed of rakshasas until
we had listened to young stark-
weathers story when he told us of
the evil-eyed creatures who perse-
cuted his so lovely wife and how the
sentry at the palace gate declared he
had seen no stranger leave though
the scoundrel had fled but a moment
before  remembered how aristide
the waiter assured us no one sat at
the table where we saw the unlovely
four with our own eyes even as he
spoke

  also had not the young monsieur
tolu us his lovely lady was analt cjnm-
pavj-without known father but
of course what more reasonable
than to suppose her mother bad been
imposed on by a fiend even as bertha
of the legend married the foul incu-
bus and was then left without hus-
band at the birth of her daughter
such things have been

  nature as your american slang
has it is truly grand she is exceed-
ingly grand my friends for every
plague with which mankind is visited
good kind nature provides a remedy
can we but find it the vampire can
not cross running water and is af-
frighted of wild garlic blooms the
holy leaves of the holly tree and the
young shoots of the ash are terrible
to the werewolf so with the rak-
shasa the fruit and blossom of the
lime is to him as molten lead is to us
if lie makes an unclean feast of hu-
man flesh-of which he is most fond
-and disguises it as curried chicken
or rice a drop of lime juice sprinkled
on it unmasks it for what it is a
smear of the same juice on his flesh
causes him intense anguish and
while ordinary weapons avail not at
all against him-remember how
friend richard struck one with his
saber yet harmed him not-a sword
or bullet dipped in lime juice kills
him to death yes

  last night as i thought of these

things i determined on an experi-
ment tiens though it worked per-
fectly i could have struck myself for
that i caused pain to madame mu-
tina when i spilled the lime juice on
her

  now here we are madame mu-
tina beautiful as the moon as she lies
on the breast of the sea was part
human part demon in mohammeds
false religion they have no cure for
such as she what to do i ask me

    baptize her with water and the
spirit i answer so doing we shall
save her soul alive and separate that
which is diabolic from that which is
good in her so lovely body 

  you all beheld what happened
when the holy water of sacrament fell
upon her head last night but grace
a dicu we have won thus far she
are now all woman the demon in
her departed when her lovely hair
turned white

  ah but there was more to the
mystery than this why were those
three poor ones done to death why
did she leave her husband almost at
the threshold of the lune de miel-
how do you say it-honeymoon
those questions i also ask me there
is but one sure way to find out this
morning i talk seriously with her

  it are needless for me to say she
is beautiful-we are men we have all
the excellent eyesight in our eyes
but it is necessary that i report that
the he-creaturcs of the rakshasas had
also found her exceedingly fair
when it was reported that she would
be truly married to friend richard
not o be a wife in name only to a
paralyzed old dodo of a sultan they
were furious they sent an ambassa-
dor to her to say you shall not wed
this man

  greatly did she fear these devil-
people but greater than her fear was
iter love for the gallant gentleman
who would take her to wife in the
face of all the palace scandal

  now sacred to these unclean
rakshasas is the coconut pearl the
the deyil-people



pearl which is truly mother-of-pearl
because it contains within an outer
shell of lovely nacre an inner core of
true pearl as the coconut shell en-
closes the white meat one of these
-and they are very rare-our dear
madame mutina stole from the rak-
shasa temple to hold as hostage for
the safety of her beloved that is
what she entrusted to me last night
when she beheld the evil-eyed ones at
the elub

  but though she held the talisman
she still feared the devil-people ex-
ceedingly and when one of them fol-
lowed her to manila and threatened
death to her beloved if she consorted
with him though it crushed her heart
to do so site tied from her husband
and hid herself securely

 a womans love plumbs any
depths however my friends just to
be near her wedded lord brought ease
to her mangled bosom and so she fol-
lowed him to america and because
she dances like a snowflake sporting
with the wind and a moonbeam flit-
ting on flowing water she had no
trouble in securing employment at la
pantoufle doree

  the rakshasas have also traveled
overseas seeking their sacred token
they traced madame mutina and
would perchance have slain her even
as they murdered her companions
had she not trusted us with the pearl
and bidden us bear it away to her
house knowing where she lived
suspecting perhaps that she hid the
precious pearl there the evil ones
reached the house before us slew her
friends and waited for us but we-
friend trowbridge and i-put one of
them at least to flight while the ar-
rival of sergeant costello and his ar-
rest of madame mutina prevented
their working their will on her mean-
time i hold the much-sought pearl

  from his jacket pocket he took an
object about the size and shape of a
hens egg a beautiful opalescent
thing which gave off myriad coruscat-
ing beams in the rays of the firelight

  but where do the evil-eyed sons
of satan and his imps hide them-
selves can we find them he asked
perhaps yes perhaps no in any
event it will take much time and we
wish for speed therefore we shall
resort to a ruse de guerre this morn-
ing after i talked with madame mu-
tina i did rush to the office of le
journal with a celerity beautiful to
behold and with the consent of the
proprietor of la pantoufle doree who
is an excellent fellow and sells most
capital liquor i inserted the adver-
tisement which friend trowbridge
has just read

  eh men but the devil-people will
surely flock to that cabaret in force
tomorrow night will they not place
reliance in their devilish ability to
defy ordinary weapons and attempt
to seize the pearl from madame mu-
tina as she dances i shall say they
will but-he twisted the ends of
his mustache savagely-but they
reckon without an unknown host my
friends you cher sergent will be
there you friend richard and you
also friend trowbridge will be
there as for jules de grandin by
the horns blood and tail of the devil
he will be there with both feet

  ha messieurs les diables tomor-
row night we shall show you such a
party as you wot not of your black
blood which has defied the weapons
of men for generations untold shall
flow like springtime freshets when the
mounting sun unlocks the icy fetters
from the streams

  and those we do not spoil entirely
in the taking you shall have the
pleasure of seating in the electric
chair mon sergent he concluded
with a bow to costello

the following night here and there
the bald head or closely shaven face
of some regular patron caught the


weird tales

soil lights from the central chan-
delier but the vast majority of the
tables were occupied by small dark
siilister-looking foreigners men with
oblique eyes and an air of furtive evil
which llieir stylishly out dinner
dollies and sleekly anointed hair
could not disguise strategically
placed near every exit were mem-
bers of sergeant costellos strong-arm
squad looking decidedly uncomfort-
able in their hired dinner clothes and
consuming vast quantities of the free
menu provided by starkweathers lib-
eral arrangements with the manage-
ment with an air of elaborate uncon-
cern four patrolmen in plain
clothes lounged near the checkroom
counter eyeing each incoming guest
with shrewd appraising glances

  near the dancing-floor facing each
other across a small table sat de
 rand in and starkweather while
costello and i made ourselves as in-
conspicuous as possible in our places
near the swinging doors which
screened the main entrance to the
club

  not many couples whirled and
glided on the dancing-floor for the
preponderance of men among the
patrons was noticeable and the usual
air of well-bred hilarity which char-
acterized the place was almost en-
tirely lacking 

  it was almost half-past  when de
grandin gave the signal

  now customers announced the
hostess advancing o the center of the
floor were in for a real treat you
all know mamselle mutina shes
danced here before but she never did
anything like shes going to show to-
night this is ab-so-lutely the cats
meow and i dont mean perhaps
either all set boys and girls come
on then give the little ladv a big
hand

  two attendants ran forward
spreading a rich turkish carpet over
the smoothly waxed boards of the
dancing-floor and as they retreated
every light in the place winked out

leaving the great room in sudden ab-
solute darkness then like a thrust-
ing sword-blade a shaft of amethyst
light stabbed through the gloom cen-
tering on the purple velvet curtains
beside the orchestra stand no sound
came from the musicians and the
place was so still i coild hear cos-
tellos heavy breathing where he sat
three feet away and the faint flutter
of a menu-card sounded like the
scutter of a wind-blown leaf in a
quiet forest clearing

  gazing fascinated at the curtains

i	saw them move ever so slightly
flutter a moment then draw back
mutina stood revealed

  one little hand on each curtain
she stood like a lovely picture in a
frame a priceless jewel against a
background of opulent purple velvet

  over her head covering her snowy
hair was drawn a dark-blue veil
silver-fringed and studded with silver
stars and bound about her brows
was a chaplet of gold coins which
held the magically glowing opales-
cent indong mutina against her fore-
head like the sacred asp on an egyp-
tian monarchs crown iter lovely
shoulders and bosom were encased in
a tight-fitting sleeveless zouave jack-
et of gold-embroidered cerise satin
fringed with gilt hawk-bells from
hips to ankles hung a full inany-
plaited skirt of sheerest white mus-
lin which revealed tlie slim lines of
her tapering legs with distracting
frankness about her wrists and
ankles were garlands of cunningly
fashioned metallic flowers enameled
in natural colors which clashed
their petals together like tiny cym-
bals setting up a sweet musical
jinglc-jangle each time she moved

  for a moment she poised on slim
henna-stained toes bending her little
head with its jewel of glowing pearl
as if in response to an ovation then
raising her arms full length she
laced her long supple fingers above
her head pirouetted half a dozen

highwaymen

 by w benson dooling

boyle slipped a long pistol
from his hoot and drew the
trigger back its sharp claek-
click was mellowed by the soft swish
of his cloak as he drew it more close-
ly about his shoulders and waist for
this was a chill night one of the
somber kind and this a minute dur-
ing such a night when sounds soften
expectantly when insects cease their
drone and seem to wrait boyle
pulled lower the sagging front of his
featherless velvet hat and slipped a
mask of some dark stuff about his
eyes his horse neighed

  from below on the road by which
he stood straight and expectant on
his mount-a road that twined and
curled down the mountainside a
hard-packed road much used by the
private carriages of the aristocracy
and hardly wide enough for a public
coach-came the rattle of liools of a
jogging pair and the clank and tur-
moil of spinning wheels the volume
of sound incieased grew louder and
more distinct as the vehicle ap-
proached and boyle heeled his beast
to the road as a small coach wheeled
into view

  stand and deliver whelp

  boyles voice was acid with a
sharpness that brooked no argument
a frightened coachman hauled in his
pair

  a moon shone but softly it was
not bright enough to illumine any
sentiment on the drivers face but it
disclosed a gaunt gray-mustaclied
man who alighted quickly from the
coach-an elderly dignified green-
coated man who muttered sire i

had heard your kind were more
polite  

  politeness is the courtly gesture
of honest hypocrites milord   
but quick-your valuables boyle
waved his weapon carelessly and
leant low in his saddle peering
quickly into the dark coach

  my money  there its all i have
with me fortunately the gaunt
man sneered and passed a small
leathern bag to boyles waiting hand
said boyle no jewels

  came the answer when travel-
ing but no no jewels

    my thanks whos in there   
my daughter shes but a child
then  i leave you the most
precious of your accouterments   
a pale blond head leant from the
open coach with twro pretty blue cur-
ious peering eyes and a small hand
grasped the gentlemans sleeve
father asked a young fright-
ened voice is that man the ghost
they talked about at the inns who
haunts the hills-the bandit ghost
father

  peace child well sire mav we
go

   but soft   to the child boyle said
kindly filly i am but a collector
of revenues i have never met the
spook of whom you speak though in
sooth ive heard his name but
youll cloud your pretty face think-
ing too much on ghosts better for-
get them like me my pretty dear
   sire you are at liberty to go
   quick whelp

  the blond head vanished and the
gentleman regained his scat and

                                      


weird tales

slammed shut the door the coachman
whipped his horses on too glad to
go to resent the sobriquet whelp
applied by boyle

  boyle heeled his sable then gave
him free rein he wished the child
had not- spoken of the ghost for boyle
did not believe in ghosts far for-
ward he leant and low-hanging
branches threatened his hat once his
cloak caught in brambles and roughly
tore loose again the sharp wind
was pleasing biting at his hollow
cheeks boyle was horribly emaci-
ated lie was a sportive man who
drank and loved too much

  night resumed its somber sounds
the chirping of tiny nocturnal in-
sects  from somewhere away the hun-
gry bay of a wolf above a screech-
owl voiced its curdling sound
boyles horse drew back affrighted
then at a reassuring word from
boyle moved on

  suddenly lie drew him in this
was a clearing in the wood and the
moon seemed suddenly more bright
boyle was perplexed and lost he
did not know this place strange
his horse had led him astray though
the beast knew so well the way from
the road through almost impercept-
ible paths in the thick wood to the
cabin that boyle at present occupied

  a formation of trees beyond the
clearing fascinated him the moon
shone full upon it making strange
shadows in the grass below sparse
near the trunk two trees stretched
out long arras-chill and bare arms
that touched and seemed one length-
ened arm it looked like a gibbet
and through some monstrous fantasy
-caused perhaps by branches and
leaves of trees beyond-the shadow
on the sward enhanced this effect
and added a shadow like a mans
which seemed gently to move to
swing

  affrighted boyles horse drew
back and chawed his bit and pawed
with his forefeet and rolled his flank
boyle held him in and perspiration

  beaded his brow he saw that the horse
was innocent of the trees and their
fantasmagoria that the beast was
alarmed at something more subtle
something boyle had not vet sensed

  soft ned

  the beast was still he trusted
boyles intelligence

  stand and deliver sire the
command came from behind him-a
soft modulation in courteous almost
tender tones but hollow somber
chilling they seemed the voice of an-
other world the sentence seemed to
come unwillingly as though its au-
thor spoke against inclination did
something repugnant that seemed ex-
pected of him

  boyle wheeled his horse before
him in the full moonlight another
horseman stood his mount was
snow-white and fleshy but looked
fleet its rider was cloaked and
masked yet under the mask was a
mat-white skull-a skull that did not
grin but held its jaws tight-set a
wisp of mustache adhered to where
the upper lip had been dark burn-
ing liquid points shone through the
mask slits and the velvet hat was
drawn too low for a forehead to be
seen straight in his saddle the
specter stood holding his pistol
muzzle toward boyles breast he
pulled his cloak about his waist as
though those fleshless ribs were chill
boyle knew the saga of this one
knew that he had been hanged a hun-
dred years before

  boyle moaned the ghost   
the devil    the ghost  

  instinctively his hand reached
down-a nervous shaking groping
hand-and drew the pistol from his
boot a chill crept along his spine
his jaw gaped his tongue slid out
strangely parched and back again
his teeth chattered

clack-click his pistol hammer
made an a woesome sound that seemed
very loud he swung the muzzle to-
ward the others head and touched

h	look whos here
folks jane lee rose to
her knees in the sand and
pointed her finger toward the sea
we the whole group of us were
lolling around under a huge beaeh
parasol and i with the rest turned
to see what had arrested janes atten-
tion even as she informed us by
adding theres ben tarrton
following her pointing finger i
glanced across the gayly hued crowds
of bathers to the long springboard
jutting from the pier where a sol-
itary man stood poised leisurely
swaying over the water

  theres benny tarrton dan i
turned to my younger brother who
lay sprawled on the sand at my side

    w t-

the chap youve been hearing so
much about since you came home
give him the once over all youve
heard is true

  dan raised himself to his elbows
and i watched him covertly my pride
in him swelling the heart in me his
long body was hard and lean his
skin was bronzed to a deep oak-tan
he had all the earmarks of the
typical outdoor man though there
was something in dan more than that
mere manliness you saw on the sur-
face we had always been very close
but he had been away from me so
long nowr that there was to my
bewilderment a tenuous and impen-
etrable veil raised between us i
was conscious of always struggling
against it ever since he had come

                                   


weird tales

north but of being as powerless as a
man trying to batter his path through
a veil of fog

  i studied him now striving to
plaee the thing that had come between
us his deep-set black eyes had lit
with a trace of sardonic amusement
as he focused them upon the figure
poised on the springboard i knew
what he was thinking rather closely
he was thinking over again the things
lie had said to me only that moniing
ben tarrton how the women did
rave over the man they exhausted
every time-honored cliche in existence
in an effort to express their admira-
tion even the men asserted heartily
that tarrton was a regular fellow
dan tossed his straight black hair out
of his eyes and lit a cigarette then
lie looked at me with a grin and gave
me a sarcastic reply

  oh so its all true is it well
ive heard plenty jesse sure he
can come up to specifications

  he certainly can  answered
heartily i liadnt known ben so
long if you counted it by decades
but by mere years i had known him
long enough to be able to judge i
thought dans grin was almost a
sneer he blew a puff of smoke into
the hot lazy air and surveyed ben
with large interest ill call him
over  i offered cfipping my hands
together to form a sounding hollow
i raised mv voice in a loud halloo
hi- ben f

 the man on the springboard
paused in the act of setting his superb
body for a dive and thatls no mere
term of admiration he was superb
six feet three built like cellinis
perseus and his every line right then
displayed to striking advantage by
brilliant blue swimming shorts he
turned with his hands half raised in
the air nodding and his head glinted
in the sun he lifted his resonant
baritone voice in answer

 oh there you arc be right
over  

  dan glanced idly at me then his

gaze went back to ben and he
watched him intently as he made a
clean perfect dive swam indolently
to the shore and started up the beach
i wasnt paying much attention my
mind was irritatedly going over
again and again that elusive differ-
ence in dan

  six years in mexico had served to
alienate dan from our old set what
there was left of it between the
additions and subtractions contin-
ually being accomplished by the
great mathematician it was almost a
new set to dan he felt himself an
outsider now a rank un-belonger
he had summed it up to me with faint
cynicism down there below the
border strenuous labor under a broil-
ing sun had made of him a different
piece of flesh in the face of all that
grind and drill in the south the
idling of this pleasure-hunting crowd
of ours seemed so futile and petty
and vain

  i had listened to his saying all that
over repeatedly as though he knew
i sensed the difference in him and
wanted to explain it away but he
was not explaining it away by a long
shot those differences he delineated
were all on the surface-they had to
do with the flesh yes exactly and
the difference in dan was not of the
flesh i suppose it was of the spirit
soul or whatever you choose to call
it but it was something inside of
dan that bothered me and held mo
off and made of me a stranger also

  ho had been very reluctant to comc
north but  wouldnt take no for an
answer and i had advanced every
logical argument i could think of i
had reminded him that he had a
vacation coming he hadnt taken
one since he went there i had
recalled to him that he hadnt even
come up for our fathers funeral
though that wasnt his fault
accident had taken the old chap so
suddenly dan couldnt have got
home before the funeral was over
anyway but i mentioned it when i
the vengeance of the dead



was urging him to come i was
taking a party of old friends out to
spend a month or more at fathers old
hunting-lodge and i had insisted that
dan become one of the number he
had answered finally that the trip
wouldnt mean anything to him out-
side of seeing me again but he
would come

 he caught my gaze on him
gestured toward the rest of the
group scowled and spoke in an
undertone   doesnt look very prom-
ising jesse this outing of playboys
to a hard-boiled working h ombre like
yours truly one thing is certain i
dont consider it entertaining listen-
ing to a continual round of silly
enthusiasm over a handsome cake-
eater 

  i felt an uneasy chilly sense of
premonition something alien and
sinister gripped me and held me still
prevented me from making any
response why such a prescience
was utterly without reason what
was there in dans disgruntled
remark to cause any dark forebod-
ing  i couldnt fail to know what he
meant his deep-set black eyes were
still on ben who was drawing close
to the group and the group men
and women alike were extravagantly
sounding praises to ben tarrton

  dan spoke again his voice still
lower and something dragged my
gaze to my brothers eyes that bird
is due for a cropper some of these
days jesse i dont think a fellow of
his type is too-well too safe to have
around i wonder if i could persuade
you to chalk off this party some
way  

  rot i retorted impatiently
  what right have you to say a thing
like that what do you know about
him you never saw him before did
you  

  no i never sawr him before
dan returned dryly but ive
heard enough about him to last me
the rest of my days

  well forget it i returned my

tone a little sharp perhaps i
certainly shall not chalk off the party
were going to the lodge and have a
high old time roughing it and youll
blend in after a day or two youll
forget such nonsense when you see
more of ben youve just heard
so much chatter that youre prej-
udiced

  yes well its on your head
old scout only you cant say i
didnt warn you

dans utterance stopped short
since ben had come up to us i
shivered involuntarily there was
something so malignant and menacing
in dans eyes that for a moment i
wondered if this were really my
brother that mysterious foreboding
again but i got to my feet striving
to brush it away from me and held
out a hand to ben

  hello old-timer i greeted him
so you did manage to get here ch
i began to fear you werent going to
make it

 so did i tarrton smiled
and i had to compromise to get
here at all i had promised markelle
to join his yachting party i go to
them on the twenty-fourth that
gives me a week at the wilds is
this the crowd thats going he
indicated the group behind us under
the parasol and i nodded

  and again that something alien
and sinister chilled me to the marrow
i shook myself inwardly angrily it
was downright damnably silly there
on the beach in the bright hot sun a
crowd of prosaic pleasure-seekers
going on a trip to the mountains
thats all we were and we were in
a modern world in a modern at-
mosphere and none of us was at all
afflicted by superstitious or weird
ideas why should i feel the chill of
warning of some obscene and un-
speakable horror brooding over us
ready to swoop down  i bit my teeth
hard on a curse it was worse than
silly-it was absurd i looked hard


weird tales

at ben as though to reassure myself
ithat this was our ordinary world
that this was merely our common-
place gay crowd and that everything
was as it should be

  ben was smiling at jane lee
purposely i foiced myself to note
everything about him that made him
what he was though i had done that
same thing again and again i saw
nothing but the same old ben his
eyes were red-brown his heavy brows
and lashes jet-black above them
his thick mop of perfectly waved hair
was brilliant red-gold his skin was
always as white as a womans it
never tanned or burned and peeled
his cheek bones always bore a rose-
like flush and where his two dimples
bit into his cheek when he laughed
the color faded as though one had
pressed it away with a finger then
flooded slowly back i find it hard
to give you an accurate picture of the
man he was vividly unusual as you
can perceive once seen he was not
easily forgotten

  i had always considered him merely
a fellow at that peculiar sense-
provoking stage of muscular develop-
ment where the very living vibrant
flesh and blood seem to exude
magnetism dan would be forced to
admit that ben possessed a subtle
charm something on which you
couldnt lay your finger something
that did not find its genesis in his
undeniable and extravagant beauty
nor in that unfailing graciousness
enhanced by fine mannerisms and
smooth courtesy determined to keep
a hold on my common sense in spite
of dans queer actions i turned to
introduce him to ben

  dan i prompted him to decent
politeness i want you to meet ben
tarrton   dan rose to his feet with
a kind of insolent reluctance too
subtle for ben to notice but i saw it
and my irritation rose what in
thunder was the matter with dan
today with me with everything

i said almost angrily ben this is
my kid brother just up from his
beloved job in mexico i managed to
drag him away from it long enough
for this outing hes heard so much
about you that hes green with envy  
that last was a trifle malicious and
dan grinned at it

  applesauce isnt for beach con-
sumption   tarrton countered   glad
to know you dan all weve heard
from jesse since you said youd come
was dan this and dan that hes
been as tickled as a kid with a new
toy

  yes dans gaze flashed at me
and his black eyes lit jesse is an
awful kidder he answered lightly
and tarrton moved  to the rest of
the crowd

  but under dans light words and
in the sudden gleam of his eyes i
saw the evidence felt the current of
the affection that had run between us
of old i took swift advantage of it
as we reseated ourselves on the sand
side by side i made another des-
perate lunge to get closer to him to
find the old dan under this strange
veil of chill between us

  dan i said quietly cant you
see that the fellow really has
charm  

  certainly my brother agreed
  ive contacted that unnamable force
before jesse seen guys ive had to
like outwardly when inwardly i felt
instinctively that id like to kill
em

  dan i gripped his arm startled
at that malignant look which had
again crossed his face what in the
world is the matter with you
nothing at all but his face
was savage nothing is the matter
with me but im warning you my
dear brother keep your eye on that
pretty cake-cater of yours maybe
cake isnt all he eats

  what eould he mean by such a
remark there was something so
utterly menacing in his eyes as he
the vengeance of the dead



said it that i shrank from him
involuntarily i glanced at ben and
back at dan bewildered shaken only
to find dans face already smoothed
to a mildly sarcastic smile and i
heard jane lee remonstrating vig-
orously about bens short stay with
the party

 oh matt did you hear that
ben is only going to be with us for a
few days

  i glanced at her she had turned
to her husband who was lying beside
her fiat on his back a disreputable
old panama hat pulled down over his
face at his wifes words lee shoved
the hat upward an inch and frowned
at the new arrival

 what does this mean young
man matt demanded in mock
severity weve been planning this
outing at the wilds for over a
month and here at the last moment
you ditch us how come

  oh just my terribly rotten luck
matt ben explained he had seated
himself in the center of the group
i promised to attend this outing a
month ago granted youve got me
tli ere but on the same day i
promised markelle to attend his
yachting party too jesse set the
date at the wilds for the seventeenth
the mixup arose because markelle
left his date open and here last
week he called me up and said
they were leaving harbor on the
eighteenth hes a touchy cuss and
i couldnt turn him down cold he
finally said theyd hold up for me till
the twenty-fourth sorry but it was
the best i could do

  oh heck that makes me tired
ben youre a mean person to go and
bust up the party that way nan
boyce wrinkled her nose in disgust
and tarrton laughed

  im not busting up the party
monkey the rest of you will have
three or four weeks there after im
gone besides six days is better

than not going at all for me at
least  

 rather agreed marian glad-
stone the one elderly woman in the
party our conventional chaperone

 i swung around to dan defen-
sively as though i wanted to convince
him of something when it was only
myself i wanted to convince there
you are i said peevishly like an
irritated child you see theyre
just a group of ordinary merry-
makers out for a good time and
bens the pet of the bunch how
can you make  such uncalled for
remarks about him dan id like to
jar you into your old self

 dont my brothers smiling
face went cold with a grimness that
was almost inhuman i would not
go back and traverse again the hell
ive known for all eternity could
offer i am as i am today and you
can never make me any different
take me as i am and be patient with
me you may trust me i wont
spoil your party because i detest men
like tarrton but i shall certainly
keep my eye on him i can tell you
that marians talking to you

 oh pardon me i didnt hear
you marian   i moved away slightly
from dan and glanced across at our
chaperone what were you say-
ing   

 merely that waggener wilds
sounds rather primitive marian
answered is it

  you may judge for yourself i
informed her rather absent-mindedly
mv mind still on the puzzling aspect
of that antagonism dan felt for ben
tarrton im glad youre going to
sec it at last its quite a lodge
when father built it you know he
swore that he was going hack to
nature he wouldnt have phone
electric light or radio on the place
the only way you can reach it is by
gravel road running through virgin
forest  

 wow lee sat up suddenly


weird tales

running his hands through his hair
to make it stand on end brrrrr
im a wild man i thirst for the
jungles how many acres am i
gonna have to run wild in
eighty i answered smiling at
their horseplay i was grateful for
their nonsense it wrapped the
nvantle of my sanity closer about
me brought me closer to my sun-
lit ordinary world divided me
momentarily from those chill and
forbidding shadows that shrouded
dan wanned i answered almost as
lightly as ben had spoken its
on a sizeable mountain plenty far
enough from civilization the r 
s railroad runs by a mile and a half
away the nearest town is nine miles
distant natchez the caretaker keeps
six dogs to save himself from going
looney from loneliness-a brace of
police dogs a collie a red setter and
i couple of big fierce bloodhounds
the hounds arc wicked brutes
natchez always keeps them ehained
when theres anyone at the lodge
which isnt often ive only been up
once myself since dad died youll
ivd like robinson crusoe once you
i t  that mountain top better not
forget any such little things as collar
buttons and suspenders i finished
striving to perfect and hold the
csual air i had almost attained

  whats a suspender jane lee
looted derisively and got to her feet
dragging matt after her if this
outfit is starting for waggener wilds
t the ungodly hour of  in the
morning  move that we hustle along
mistead of lounging around here argu-
ing about whos going to play with
 he dogs and whos going to hunt
collar buttons

    second the motion   shouted lee
jumping up from the sand all in
favor say aye the ayes have it
its go he linked his arm
 ossessively through his wifes and
started toward the board walk on a
run pulling her along with him

iwatj grateful for their chattering
but it didnt help me much i
hadn t been able to achieve the casual
and what little i had gained was
slipping again as i flicked a glance at
dan he was watching ben tarrton
like a lynx his face impassive his
eyes unreadable there was growing
on me an impression that angered me
because i didnt have the power to
shake it an impression that some-
thing was going to happen something
horrible and gruesome i set my
teeth then tarrton had passed and
nan boyce caught his arm as he ran
and the two of them overtook the lees
together the four turned down the
board walk at a brisk pace and rick
boyce spoke to me in a good-natured
grumbling

  guess im deserted jesse
well take you into custody
rick jim gladstone wiped his
perspiring bald head helped his wife
up and pushed his spectacles closer to
his near-sighted eyes are we off
jesse

  t nodded and fell into step with
them throwing one arm across dans
shoulder it was an instinctive
gesture with me as though i could by
that physical touch reach him dispel
the insane fear that was rising in me
and beat off the dark cold cloud that
was enveloping him we moved off
abreast the five of us then sud-
denly apropos of nothing marian
gladstone said

  do you know jim-im afraid
eh-what afraid her hus-
band looked at her in astonishment
and i started marian afraid
marian wasnt afraid of the devil
himself jims look turned to a stare
and he asked sharply what do you
mean what in the world are you
afraid of

  its not what im afraid of
marian shivered its whom im
afraid for

  well for the lords sake who are
you afraid for jim demanded and
the vengeance of the dead



in a sidelong glance i eanght dan
watching them both

  im afraid for ben marian said
sharply rick boyce looked at her
pop-eyed and i felt dans shoulders
go rigid under my arm

  why jim almost snapped

 i-i dont know she shook
herself as though she were coming
out of a daze and turned her eyes on
me there was a puzzled confused
look in them her eyes expressed
what i felt she repeated i dont
know i guess its just that hes too
popular you know what i mean
hes too happy hes too well off
hes too unearthly beautiful here
he is at the age of thirty-six wealthy
carefree friend to everybody and
loved by everybody   she stopped
speaking abruptly and we all waited
in a tense silence for her to go the
silence lengthened unpleasantly and
jim broke it in nervous impatience

  well what of it is it so unusual
to see a man without enemies

  n-n-no marian frowned shrink-
ing uneasily as though she saw some-
thing that frightened her i-i
dont know how to say it i guess
its that he-that life is too smooth
for him it isnt according to the
laws of the world that it can go on

dont you see he-hell- she

stumbled and came down to the
blatantly ordinary the finish of her
sentence was really ridiculous   he 
marry the wrong girl and be
wretchedly unhappy-or hell get in
an accident and be killed or
crippled  

  oh is that all thats bothering
you jim laughed aloud

  all right laugh marian flared
darkly but i tell you if there was
only one person who disliked him
violently id feel easier about him
hed seem more-more human some-
way  

  i felt dan breathing quickly felt
the stiffening of his arm against my
side and jim laughed again but not

so wholesomely as he had before
what a thing to say he remarked

 and what a beastly turn the
conversation has taken rick boyce
put in uneasily as though he didnt
approve of what was being said and
wanted to turn talk to other
channels but dan followed up
marians remarks with a short ques-
tion

 how long has tarrton been a
member of our particular set
marian  

nearly all the time youve been
in mexico almost five years why

 well- dan gave her a keen

look and that strange cloud or veil
passed over his deep black eyes his
tone was jesting but his face made
me quiver with a revulsion of sick
fear the rest of the crowd is all
new to me marian he went on
even ricks lately acquired wife
nan but-if it will make you feel
any easier about tarrton i dont
mind admitting that i-dont like
him  

 what dan whats that you
say rick raised inquiring brows
at him why you never saw him
before did you

  no dan shook his head soberly
i never saw him before but ive
a right to my opinions i presume
and i simply dont like him thats
all

  his voice chopped off curtly and
nobody said anything we turned
onto the board walk and hurried to
overtake the rest of the party be-
fore cod i felt that the world was
coming to an end or that something
equally as cataclysmic was approach-
ing us the feeling of impending
disaster that had been growing on me
all day swooped down with a roar i
could almost hear i want to tell you
i was frightened t was scared stiff
and i dont lmow any other way to
say it i knew with a strange sicken-
ing certainty that we were all of us
rushing headlong into a vast harrow-


weird tales

ing experience that there loomed
right across our path some horrible 
ghastly danger

  it i could have turned the whole
crowd back right then i would have
done it but i knew they would only
laugh at me and behind my back
decide that i was a very disagreeable
and insulting host i couldnt do
anything but go  with my feet
feeling like lead a nauseating empti-
ness at the pit of my stomach that
made me want to retell and a tension
put on my nerves that made me want
to scream as we reached the bath
house down the beach where the
others had turned in to dress and
rick and the gladstones followed
them i held dan back my arm still
about his shoulder

  listen here i said harshly
staring at him so doggedly that he
had to meet my gaze finally he did
it in a kind of sad defiance i want
to know what makes you act this way
dan i demanded youve put
me in the shivers and youve scared
the daylights out of marian just by
your thoughts what in the name of
all thats holy is the matter with you
youll crab the whole party if you
dont come out of it

  no it isnt i wholl crab your
party my young brother held my
eyes with that strange sad expres-
sion and i havent anything to
say further because i am not sure
i only have a hunch ive had it for
a long time all i can say to you is
for cods sake watch ben tarrton
and-it isnt because of anything i
fear may happen to him as your
guest either whos this natchez
youve got up at the lodge

  ill tell you later i answered
jim and marian were coming out of
the bath house talking in low earnest
tones and i wanted desperately to
attain a casual air before the whole
crowd got together again

  i dont know whether i managed it
or not marian seemed to have put
by her queer impressions and the rest

of the party came along presently
laughing and chaffing each other
whatever gloominess may have hung
over me was effectually neutralized
by their giddy banter we rushed
over to the garage where the cars
were waiting the luggage all in and
piled into the seats i took the wheel
of the big hammerton eight that
belonged to me and the others trailed
along in the rear as i stepped on the
gas and turned her loose down the
boulevard but riding with me even
closer than dan who sat at my side
dark and silent was a leering evil
presence that made me fairly hunch
over the wheel my eyes glued to the
road ahead

	cassimcr natchez

 dont think that either dan or i
spoke again till we had roared into
town put up the car and hurried on
to the hotel where the party was
stopping over night once we
attained our room having evaded the
rest of the crowd i still found it im-
possible to break the ugly silence that
brooded over dan and me until he
abruptly reminded me that i was
going to tell him about the caretaker
at the lodge relieved at having any
topic of conversation that would keep
me going for any length of time i
launched into a painstaking descrip-
tion of natchez

  cassimcr natchez was a tall
powerfully built man in the middle
forties his eyes were set into their
sockets in a queerly square orifice
even the lines of his face and head
were square and those same lines
were carried out in the length and
breadth of his big body the first
time  saw him i thought he must be
the kind of man from whom the
cubists chose their prototype he was
always silent in a forbidding callous
manner as though life had dealt
him so many heartless punches that
he felt no reason for being gracious
to anybody since he couldnt trust
the vengeance of the oka i



anybody you felt his distrust even
before you saw it in his eyes a pass-
able civility was the nearest approach
to courtesy he ever attained but he
was dependable and father had
installed him at the lodge and  did
not feel exactly licensed to discharge
him just because i didnt like him
now that father was dead and i was
left with a free rein

  father was always picking up
queer characters the way he had
come into touch with natchez was
characteristic of him he had found
cass sitting on a park bench late one
afternoon as he was hurrying across
the park to hail a taxi and get in out
of the rain he took a speculative
glance at natchez sitting there in
the downpour wet to the skin
huddled in a crouch trying ineffec-
tually to pull the cork of a small
bottle something about natchez
arrested fathers attention and he
stopped abruptly father was always
interested in the bench holders

  let me help you he offered
reaching out a hand for the bottle
i have a corkscrew in my pocket

  he took the bottle from natchezs
chilled fingers while the derelict sat
and stared at him open-mouthed but
father didnt pull the cork he
threw the bottle violently into the
street where it smashed against the
curb and scattered its contents into
the gutter the man on the bench
leaped up with an angry oath

  why in hell did you do that

  i saw the red skull and cross-
bones on the label my friend
father told him quietly pushing
him back down upon the bench and
seating himself beside him forgetting
all about the driving sheets of rain
now why were von going to do
that

  tve no reason for living
nalchez muttered then he proceeded
to tell father a long rigmarole about
himself a conglomeration of the true
and false i suspect but gullible old
father believed every word he felt

sorry for natchez and the upshot of
it was that he installed him as care-
taker at the lodge ije had been
there ever since

  dan listened silently until i had
finished the account of how natchez
came to be at the lodge then he
asked why dont you like him
ive told you i answered with
some impatience hes surly and
uncivil hes proved himself depend-
able and honest but it wouldnt
hurt him to try courtesy for a
change hes too damned sour for
his own good

 maybe lies had something to
make him sourdan suggested

   believe he had a daughter
that may have been a trifle nasty
but im a bachelor and none too
trusting in the matter of women ive
always tolerated them and some ot
them ive liked but i never loved
any of them and i failed to see why
any man should also i had a
theory that any man who kept a
woman around continually was let-
ting himself in for a lot of grief dan
chuckled

  still the same old woman-hater
eh well fry to find some good in
this natchez ive a hunch he may be
a pretty good sort under the crust
say are you crazy i demanded
sourly you rave here you make
all manner of nasty insinuations
against ben whom you ve never seen
before and now youre standing up
for that beast natchez and you
havent seen him yet what have you
been drinking or is it dope
neither dan answered his
sober face making me ashamed of my
testiness its intuition down
there on that job of mine ive had a
lot of time to think ive been pretty
much alone and ive been studying
various things i had to have some-
thing to take up my mind if i
wanted to preserve my sanity among
other things ive been delving into
the supernatural i suppose youll
sneer at that


weird tales

    no   i shook my head though i
felt suddenly uneasy again i dont
sneer at it but i dont put any
credence in it either you arent
getting to be a spook-ehaser are
you

 he merely looked at me the
remark had been facetious and trivial
enough to cause him offense and i
cant say that i blame him but i
was so nerve-fagged that i didnt
have good judgment the very air
about me was increasingly oppressive
i could have sworn there were
sulfurous fumes insulting my nostrils
with their fetid effluvia it made me
dizzy sick

 i know whats the matter i
said abruptly im sick just a
slight megrim the sea air never did
agree with me any too well ill be
all right once wc reach the lodge
and that atmosphere up there will
knock the doldrums out of me come
on and lets get to bed were making
an early start tomorrow

  dan did not speak but he assented
with a nod and began slowly to
undress i pretended to go almost
immediately to sleep i didnt want
to talk any more i wanted to think
over the incidents of the whole day
to assault again the baffling problem
of dans strangeness to strive to
analyze the veil tht was grown into
a foglike wall between us he
crawled in beside me presently and
pul out the light i dont know
which of us slept the least i knew
from his breathing now and then that
lie was awake but i never once let
him know i was awake it was the
same thing that weighed us both
down only he knew more of what it
was than i i only knew that i like
marian gladstone was afraid

it was evening of the next day
before we arrived at the lodge
though wc roared along at a good
pace i had managed to get in a little
sleep before t got up that morning
and t wasnt feeliner too much off my

feed when dan and i joined the
crowd there was such a bustle of
getting ready and hurrying to be off
from the hotel that nobody had much
time for imagining things then
again the morning air was warm and
clear and it brightened me a great
deal after i settled down in my car
with dan at my side and the back
of the car piled with luggage i
resolutely kept clear of any subject
that could upset me again-ben
tarrton or cassimer natchez or
supernatural business or anything
else i turned the old hammerton
loose and let her roll dan was
content to leave me to my driving
and my thoughts part of the time
he dozed we stopped only once for
lunch and then rushed  again
depending  being at the lodge in
time for dinner we made it neatly
and natchez came down the steps of
the lodge to open the car doors and
take out the luggage as we idled
down to a stop before the building

  hello natchez i greeted him
throwing open the foredoor and
ignoring his habitual scowl hows
the world treating you my brother
dan natchez just up from mexico
i wrote you he was coming

  natchez grunted sourly glanced
past me toward dan and his gaze
riveted his scowl evaporated-thats
the only way to say it i never saw
such a change in a mans face in
one moment the dour rude natchez
i knew was there then a bright
astonished look passed across his
features like the sun coming out from
behind a cloud throwing its rays upon
a mountain you know what i mean
youve seen sudden sun on a moun-
tain while the mountain was in the
shadow it looked chill and bleak
colorless as though it were shrouded
in snow but the moment the sun
reached it you saw to your amaze-
ment that the mountain was fresh
alive and green and that which you
had thought to lie snow was revealed
as patches of white fragrant flowers
the vengeance of the dead



youve had that experience well
thats what happened to natchez for
just one moment as he gazed at dan
and i heard him mutter borden
waggener come alive again
borden waggener was my father
then the sun was gone from his face
and the same old grumpy natchez
acknowledged the introduction sul-
lenly how-do

  i grinned at dan as the other cars
came to a stop behind us and natchez
began piling out the bags onto the
porch steps we got out gratefully
stretching ourselves and turned to
see that eveiybody had arrived safe
then the dogs came running up in a
pack just as ben tarrton stepped
down from lees car and started to
join me to my astonishment ben
stopped short and some of the
fine coloring ebbed from his cheeks
i stared and turned to see what
had startled him he was gazing
straight at the dogs and they
had come to a halt as abruptly
as he they were all silent not
barking and frisking as they usually
did and the big ugly hounds were in
the lead like a pack of wolves they
herded together their hackles rising
their noses snarling and their lips
writhing back from their threatening
teeth

 natchez i whirled sharply
upon the caretaker abruptly un-
strung and thrown back into the
disgusting abyss of apprehension that
had engulfed me the night before
and at sight of natchez i shivered
and fought to keep from crying
out he too was staring at ben
though ben didnt see it with
red gleaming eyes and snarling lips
just like the dogs natchez t
snapped take those damned dogs
of yours back there and chain them
up move theyre regular savages 

  natchez gave an odd little sigh a
quick intake of breath and i saw him
quiver from head to foot then again
that lightning change passed over his
face he was again merely sour old

natchez he leaped upon the hounds
with no more fear than if he had been
blood brother to them grasped them
firmly by their collars and dragged
them away toward the garage the
other dogs followed for a second i
couldnt take my fascinated eyes
from the caretaker twice in a short
space of moments i had seen
incredible changes sweep him just
from his mere looking on another
man sight of dan had softened him
into a fine humanity sight of beu
tarrton had turned him into a fiend
i had the time to wish fervently that
we had never come before common
courtesy drove me to thought of ben

  dont mind the hounds ben
natchez should have had them
chained ill see that he keeps them
chained as long as were here i
turned to him with the best apology i
could muster he was still white
and he dragged his gaze from the
dogs acknowledging my words with
a smile but the smile was forced

  im afraid of dogs jesse he
said simply i always have been

  well ill see that they bother you
no more i assured him

  that would explain the dogs
snarling at him i told myself they
knew he was afraid of them and silly
old natchez was angered at anybody
his dogs didnt like he had some
ridiculous theory to the effect that
any man dogs distrusted couldnt be
of much account but i knew even
as i armed myself with that explana-
tion that it was sophistry dan had
already poisoned me toward ben
enough so that i was beginning to
wonder what kind of vice was hidden
beneath his dazzling exterior i was
impatient with myself for it but i
knew i had a slightly cool manner as
i motioned ben to go on up the steps
and invited the rest of the crowd to
come on into the house

we all went up the steps
together and around me t
heard them exclaiming over the


weird tales

beauty of the big log house it was
more like a sublimated fortress than
a private summer home the crowd
pattered up the wide steps and
poured into the hall as i threw open
the door to come to a chattering
group in the living-room before the
big stone fireplace father had
planned the house and my father had
loved space the rooms were big the
ceilings were high and the fireplace
would take a six foot log i had
always loved it before although i will
admit it had seemed gloomy in a
lonely way built as it was in a forest-
on the top of an isolated mountain

  but now in spite of the gay chatter
and the ohing and ailing of the
women at the unusual features of the
huge building it was suddenly more
than gloomy and dark it was
sinister brooded over by that same
nameless apprehension that had got
me in its power down on the beach
shake it i could not i was nervous
as a cat the shadows in the comers
were palpitating with leering ugly
shapes that flickered as the flames
from the fireplace threw their light 
the wall i heaid jane lee remark
something about the closed door
across the hall and i glanced at it
with a feeling of passionate regret

  besides the living-room in which
we had gathered there were on this
side of the entrance hall two more
rooms kitchen and dining-room
across the hall was a kind of den and
library combined adjoining it was
a long room that had been my fathers
private and personal lair as he
called it it was the door to that
room which was closed and it should
stay closed it had been locked since
his death all the contents of the room
left undisturbed and  took a kind of
melancholy pleasure in knowing that
the fact would have pleased him

  as my eyes came back from that
locked door i became aware that ben
tarrton was speaking to me

     whats the idea jesse    he was
gesturing toward the windows and

i saw that he had noticed the barri-
cade of heavy steel bars beyond the
panes

  wild animals i told him the
first caretaker father had up here
woke one night to the tune of break-
ing glass to find a panther in the
room he succeeded in killing the cat
but he died of his wounds father
was badly broken up about it and he
immediately installed those bars
nothing bigger than a squirrel could
enter this house when the doors are
shut i should say nothing bigger
than an ant considering the screens  

  the others went on talking volubly
about the house and i was glad to be
left to my thoughts for a moment i
looked intently about the interior of
the room why did the lodge seem
different to me from what it had been
before why was there sullen anger
in the very atmosphere of the avails
why was the odor of death in the air
with an abrupt determination to get
out into the sunset and shake the
fustiness from my brain i excused
myself and walked out upon the front
porch natchez had chained the
hounds had put the last car in the
garage and was coming back to carry
in the luggage

  as i paused on the top step of the
stairs leading down from the porch
a lough heavy-set man emerged from
the garage glanced curiously at me
and stopped to light a cigarette i
nodded toward him with my head as
natchez came to a halt just below
me and asked whos your friend
natchez

  hobo natchez answered shortly
not even looking at me they come
up once in a while from the railroad
and ask for a handout this one
drifted along a couple of days ago
ex-service man i felt sorry for him
so t let him stick around and wash
windows beat rugs and so on getting
the house ready for you to earn his
grub ill send him on about his
business now youve come but-
natcliez hesitated and shot me a dark
the vengeance of the dead



glance-even a dirty liobo is com-
pany in this god-forsaken place

  all right natchez i silenced
him shortly i didnt like his habit
of always ringing in some remark
about the loneliness of the lodge i
just wondered give him a good din-
ner before you send him off

  natchez nodded and i turned to go
back into the house i found that i
didnt care about the sunset after all
i was too infernally restless to be sat-
isfied anywhere as i passed into the
hall i noticed idly that the dogs were
fawning about the tramp and that
he patted them absent-mindedly i
heard natchez call the man to come
and give a hand with the luggage
conscious of an idle curiosity to get
a closer look at the stray i paused in-
side the living-room near the door and
stood watching from the corner of my
eye as natchez entered the hall fol-
lowed by the other man both of them
heavily loaded with bags from the
cars

  on closer inspection the stranger
gave unmistakable evidence of being
a typical example of the genus hobo
a battered felt hat was cocked on one
side of his head his coat was frayed
and stained most of its seams ripped
and showing the dirty lining he
wore no vest over his ragged shirt
and a piece of rope did duty for sus-
penders tied snugly around the
waist of his rumpled and faded
trousers a heavy growth of stubble
gave his face the uncouth disreputa-
ble look of a professional tramp but
even without the stubble the face was
evil enough little ugly mean eyes
grotesquely far apart glared out
from under a low forehead like an
apes his cheeks were broad and
sunken his mouth wtide loose and
obscene drooling slightly open over
yellowed tusklike teeth oh he was
a specimen for you i told myself
right then that i shouldnt care to
meet him alone on a dark blowing
night

  as he passed me i became conscious

 of one thing about him that made me
 turn my face away to hide a smile
 one incongruous fling at sartorial
  dignity was in his attire stuck into
 his dirty soft shirt collar was a tie-
 one of those cheap ready-made bow
 affairs with short celluloid nibs on
 each side to hold it in place-though
 it was frankly pinned in place with
 a rusty safety-pin this particular
 neckpiece was fashioned of bright
 green silk thickly studded with yellow
 polka dots natchez seeing my eyes
 on the tie leered at me as he went by
 and began to ascend the stairs

   just at that moment ben crossed
 toward me and paused at my elbow

   id like to run up to my room for
 a moment jesse he said

   i was reminded abruptly that i had
 forgotten to tell natchez in what
 order to place the luggage i had been
 so upset by my senseless apprehen-
 sions that i was becoming careless in
 my duties as host i told ben to come
 right along and i would show him his
 room that i wanted to speak to nat-
 chez anyhow we went down the
 hall and up the stairs and i paused
 with a gesture toward the door of the
 room i had intended for ben nat-
 chez and the other man wrere just
 piling the luggage in a heap to one
 side and i called natchez to bring
 mr tarrtons luggage to this room
 i added directions as to the placing
 of the rest of the luggage in the dif-
 ferent rooms the hobo stood with
 his back to me and did not pay any
 attention to what i was saying

   ben waited till i had finished giv-
 ing orders to natchez then he asked
 quietly shall i go right in jesse

   i nodded and was about to speak
 but the words died on my tongue
 the tramp hearing the sound of
 bens voice raised whirled and
 stared at him the mean little eyes
 narrowed the hobo started to say
 something then clamped his jaws to-
 gether grimly a sneer on his loose
 obscene mouth and his huge hairy
 hands clenched involuntarily i shot


weird tales

a glance at ben ben was eyeing the
man keenly slightly puzzled then
recognition flashed into bens red-
brown eyes his handsome face froze
contemptuously and he abruptly
stepped into the room i had assigned
him and closed the door

  with a feeling of helpless conster-
nation i turned and started back
down the stairs what in gods
name was the matter with this whole
trip things had started going
wrong the moment dan had laid eyes
on ben back there on the beach was
the whole world suddenly conspired to
heap on ben dislike and unpleasant
contacts

  cutting sharply into my harassed
thoughts i heard the voice of the hobo
speaking to natchez about ben
damned insufferable cocky snob
id like to paste him one

  the man is my employers guest
natchez cut him short youd
oblige me by holding your tongue

  well hes no guest of mine damn
him the tramp retorted he was
my captain overseas and id like to
mess his pretty face for him

  natchez reproved the man sharply
as i passed beyond range of hearing
descending the stairs toward the liv-
ing-room it was with something of
relief that i had caught the hobos
last sentence ben had been his cap-
tain overseas ben as an officer
would have taken no nonsense from
such a human beast and the tramp
was the exact species of lout to resent
being made to toe the line i laughed
at myself rather hollowly for my
old-womanish fears i thought i
could see now the whole train of un-
precedented incidents that had put
me in such a state of foolish appre-
hension

  in the first place ben was so well
liked by everybody as marian had
said that i had been shocked by
dans aversion to him on top of
that marian had voiced her silly
ideas and given her own explanation
of them but i had chosen to put a

deeper meaning to a womans whim
then the dogs had snarled at him but
he had explained that by making his
admission that he was afraid of dogs
the caretaker had snarled at him
also but as i have already said nat-
chez hated anyone his dogs didnt
like the tramps reason for dislik-
ing him was already made clear and

i	in a hypersensitive state had mag-
nified every trivial incident and made
mountains where not even molehills
existed

  and i walked into the living-room
to join my guests stubbornly laugh-
ing at my idiocy it was odd that all
those little things had linked to-
gether so swiftly in such a way as to
impress themselves upon my mind
but it was only coincidence and it
might well be had i not already been
upset a trifle by the strangeness about
dan that i would never have noted
 given a second thought to such in-
significant trifles yet even as i
came to a halt in the living-room and
glanced over at my brother dan i
knew i was lying to myself some-
thing hideous was in the air and all
my bravado and attempt at cold rea-
soning could not exorcise the devils
that had gotten into my brain what
i asked myself with a shudder wthat
horror was there in the lodge waiting
for us

 the rising terror

xtatchez against the coming of my
 party had brought in chin hoy
from the city to cook for us chin
and natchez had their rooms out over
the garage chin who had worked for
me many times before and knew my
tastes had gotten us a very fine din-
ner that evening but i hadnt much
appetite for it the guests all ate
heartily except ben i noticed that
he wasnt very hungry and that he
refused to take any meat at ail i
didnt think much of it then after
dinner i went out to the garage to
tell natchez to clean up the cars
the vengeance of the dead



since they were rather dusty and some
of the party might want to go driving
early

  but natchez dependable as always
was already at it while the hobo stood
leaning against the wall smoking a
cigarette and watching him natchez
glanced up at me and nodded shortly
then ordered the tramp to get into
the tonncau and dust the cushions

  sure the fellow climbed into
the car and began folding up the
tumbled rugs the car wai the blue
racer belonging to matt lee in which
the lees had brought ben tarrton
as he picked up the last of the rugs
the hobo gave a torse sneering excla-
mation and held up a small flat alli-
gator bag heres one we missed
natchez accordingto the tag it belongs

to that dirty lousy-tarrton

  natchez gave him a warning scowl
but i mostly curious to see what he
would say asked him a question in
feigned surpiize

  are you acquainted with mr
tarrton

  am i acquainted with mr tarr-
ton he mimicked me contemp-
tuously i certnly am he was my
captain overseas damn him

  well that didnt hinder him from
being a good officer i should think
i answered curtly

  natchez cackled sourly at the
thrust but the tramp leaned over the
door of the car his face darkening
with venom

     good officer say i got my fill of
that guy at brest he was nothing
but a damned cocky s o s why
we th rowed rocks at his kind at the
front a lot of guys like him got
theirs in the trenches and it wasnt
from no dutchmans bullet either
aint nothin a doughboy hates like

bein lorded over by some lousy-

  maybe you deserved it i said
coldly t wanted now only to shut
him up he had said enough to show
me exactly what i wanted to know

there was no fetid horror under his
dislike of ben but he was not to be
prevented from having his say he
hated ben with a virulent hatred and
my sarcasm had goaded him his lips
writhed in a vile grimace over his yel-
low tusks of teeth his little eyes
sparked red with fury and his voice
raised in a loathsome leer

  deserved it-hell i was in the
army ten years before the war i
know a real officer when i see one
when we was at the debarkation
camp our nerves in tatters he had the
face to rag us  couldnt hardly
keep my place in ranks and he yelled
at me dress that piece you
sneath dont you know enough to
hold that piece straight hold up
your head how long have you been
in the army i couldnt hold my
bead up i was half dead from fter-
man gas and he knew it he handed
me the worst crack you can pull on a
doughboy i nearly pasted him one
right there but that wasnt nothing
it was what i seen at the front him
out in no mans land avhen he did-
nt know i saw him the damned
dirty-

  sneaths curses dribbled off into a
gibber and suddenly his face was
pasty with the horror of something
he had seen

  well forget it i interrupted
him with sharp finality shrinking in
spite of myself at the abysmal loath-
ing and terror in his eyes i forced
myself to reach toward him give
me that bag ill take it in lie
handed it to me dumbly and i
whirled and got out of there

  i was shaking as i went up the
front steps what-what had sneath
seen at the front out in no mans
land that could even yet fill his eves
with unspeakable horror and whiten
the face of a man as thick-skinned as
he

  i dont know how i ever got into
the hall and deposited that bag all
my horror was on me again but


weird tales

some way i did it and got to bens
room and placed the bag just inside
his door

  as i came downstairs the guests
were going out to sit on the veranda
and watch the last light ebb from the
sky i trailed along reluctantly
slumped into a chair near the steps
and tried to find some contact with
the commonplace through the act of
packing and lighting my pipe they
were all chattering and having a gay
time fluttering around ben like flies
around honey and paying little at-
tention to me

  we had been there but a few min-
utes when the fellow sneath came
from the garage and started down the
road the dogs at his heels he paused
to order the animals back but the
setter wagged aconciliating tail and
refused to go a step while the police
dogs and the collies stopped in the
road and eyed him speculatively

  amused the irrepressible matt lee
called to him you leavin us bo
i see youve made friends with the
idogs

     yeh looks like it   sneath glanced
lip at lee as he made the enigmatic
answer then turned to yell toward
tlie garage hey natchez call
your dogs

  natchez appeared in the garage
door and at his peremptory order the
dogs gave a last sniff at sneath and
trotted back obediently toward their
master the tramp started down the
road again and with a queer feeling
oi pity for the fellow i hailed him

  he hesitated turned and walked
back toward me i rose and went
down the steps pulling a bill from
my pocket i pressed it into his grimy
palm wishing him luck i knew my
back was to the guests on the porch
and they could not witness my action
sneaths sullen unkempt face lighted
in pleased surprize and an excuse
for a smile tightened the loose mouth
then he pocketed the bill and turned
to pass  down the road while i re-
joined my guests on the veranda

  surly devil isnt he rick
boyce commented as i took my chair
did you see the way he glanced at
you ben

  i frowned i was hoping they
hadnt seen the one malignant flash
of sneaths eyes

  yes i noticed ben answered
with a shrug he was in my com-
pany overseas he belongs to the riff-
raff-one of the insolent breed carry-
ing a perpetual peeve for anyone in
more fortunate circumstances it was
fellows like him who got it in for the
officers and threatened to get even
when they were in civvies and all
that rot pity of it is it wasnt all
rot this fellow sneath threatened
to do for me and my first lieutenant
jimmy willotson somebody did kill
willotson after we came back but the
murderer was never caught

  but thats an exceptional case
isnt it matt lee asked

  oh yes ben nodded a lot
of the men had it in for willotson
a lot of them threatened to get him
but most of them were like this bum
sneath theyd bluster around and
make all kinds of mouthy threats but
they hadnt the courage to do any-
thing

  and did you see the trick tie
lee the inexpugnable rose to make
a sweeping bow   some class to that
gink a rope belt and a polka dot
tie oh kelly with the green neck-
tie

  everybody laughed at him and
ben suggested suddenly that as it was
getting cold out there maybe wed
better go in by the fire it was get-
ting cold all right but hardly cold
enough to make ben shiver it came
to me sharply that he looked thin
that some of the glow about him
had faded that some of his marvel-
ous color had ebbed from his
face i made a mental note that
i must have chin hoy cook up
some especial dainty for him to-
morrow to tempt his appetite i
couldnt afford to let him get to ail-
the vengeance of the dead



ing on my hands when i had brought
him up heic for a lark not the much-
loved ben the women would be
ready to hang me if i didnt take care
of their common prince charming

  i followed the party crowd into the
house noting with relief that dan had
joined in their banter to an appre-
ciable extent and that his manner
had lightened decidedly nothing of
any consequence occurred during the
evening and i sat staring into the
fireplace listening to their talk and
gradually telling myself enough rea-
sonable blah to smooth out the kinks
in my brain

it was nearing  oclock when the
guests began to tire and thought
theyd better turn in since theyd
risen unusually early enough to make
them sleepy unusually early they
bade me good-night and trooped off
to their rooms but i sat on in front
of the open grate conscious that dan
alone had remained with me sunk in
a big leather chair across the hearth

  i continued stubbornly smoking in
silence keeping my eyes averted from
my younger brothers dark brooding
face i had finally gotten everything
all explained away to suit me or
thought i had and i was determined
that i wouldnt make any comment
or ask any question to get him going
again he seemed to be more like
himself and i certainly wanted him
to stay that way and then he sud-
denly asked

  just who is this ben tarrton
jesse whats he ever done to dis-
tinguish himself

  why nothing-that i know of
i had to admit he has more money
than he knows what to do with
doesnt go in for any of the arts
never worked a lick in his life fol-
lows athletics mildly just rolls
along making a good fellow of him-
self and being agreeable hes really
a darned fine chap but i suppose
youd call him light i was battling
for the casual you see dan foiled me

  id also call him a liar he said
grimly

  a-what i staxed at him won-
dering if i had heard aright

  thats what i said-a liar you
heard me the first time the ugly
light was in dans eyes again and
his mouth was set in a harsh line
he said he was to join markelle the
twenty-fourth i dropped into mark-
elles office day before yesterday to
say hello to him he remarked that
he hoped wed have a good time up
here was glad he could change his
plans so both your party and his could
have tarrton

 yes i frowned but thats
exactly what ben said

 not exactly dan corrected
markelle told me he was to sail on
the eighteenth as he had planned and
was putting in on the florida coast
to pick up tarrton the twelfth of
next month what im wondering is
where that bird is going on the
twenty-fourth  

  but why the devil should ben lie
about it i asked assailed by swift
and fearsome doubts

 how should i know dan
shrugged and got to his feet say
jesse id like to go in fathers oid
room for a few minutes i started
to rise but he waved me back no
just give me the key id rather go
alone  

  i sank back in my chair nodded
and handed him the key i felt that
i understood he wanted to be alone
with his memories in there to renew
touch with our father in close com-
munion he took the key and went
away from me and presently  heard
the turn of a lock and the sound of
the door closing behind him then
all was still in the big gloomy old
house the fire was dying down in
the grate and the candles were burn-
ing low in their holders it was grow-
ing cold and i decided id turn in
i was on the point of rising and lock-
ing up the house when i heard the
loud sound of running feet and chin


weird tales

hoy burst in the front door i got
quickly to my feet and went to meet
him

  natchez is sick like the devil he
told me panting his almond eyes
wide and frightened you come no
i followed him out without waiting
to speak to dan besides i was re-
luctant to bother dan right then
chin hoy led me on a run to the
garage and up to the rooms wheie he
and natchez slept the caretaker lay
on his bed his face as colorless as that
of the dead his eyes closed i bent
over him startled and felt of his
pulse he was cold and clammy and
his pulse was barely discernible i
could only faintly hear the slow thud
of his heart i was shocked he
looked to be  the very borderline
i turned to chin hoy swiftly

  how long has he been like this
no can say chin hoys pop-
ping eyes stared from me to natchez
him go bed allee same hour ago
him yell him groan me allee same
scared come see ketchum likee that
call you  

  well ill have to get a doctor i
cut in the mans nearly dead
must be his heart you stay here with
him and ill go for the town doctor
no use in rousing the whole house it
wouldnt do any good you stay right
here chin

  chin nodded and sat down stiffly in
a chair by the bed i made another
rapid examination of natchez then
rushed back to the house to tell dan
what was up

  my brother had returned to the
living-room and was standing before
the fire his dark face in shadow his
brooding eyes on the wall i told him
that natchez was sick and that i was
off for the village doctor he nodded
asked if there was anything he could
do and dropped easily into the big
leather chair

  nothing but lock up the house
i told him and lock it from garret
to cellar dan hells loose here to-

night or im mad lock every door
and shoot every bolt  

  dan sat up suddenly in his chair
and leaned toward me his face tense
and his black eyes blazing  i  lock
up all right jesse but there are
some hells over which steel bars
screened windows bolts and locks
have no power

  i chose to make no answer to that
even as he spoke the room was alive
with shouting leering shadows yet i
heard no sound-i only knew they
were there great loathsome obscene
shapes that whirled about him in a
ghostly carmagnole but i could only
whirl on my heel and rush away i
didnt dare stay the whole world
was swiftly becoming an insane place
wherein a man with cool senses could
find  haven from the hall i
snatched topcoat and gloves and
dashed out into the night i raced
down the front steps slammed open
the garage doors backed the ham-
merton out turned it and slid down
the road as quietly as i could so that i
might not alarm our guests yet striv-
ing to get away from there as fast as
i could move

  the powerful lights of the car
picked out the gravel road like a metal
river running ahead of me and as i
got farther from the house i stepped
on the gas with a fierce craving for
speed i came to a turn in the road
not a half-mile from the lodge and
slowed for it as i rounded again to
the straightaway i saw some dark
object lying in the edge of the brush
lining the roadway i shoved down
the brake and threw my spotlight on
the object it was the body of an
animal and as  came abreast of it 
was aware that it was cassimer nat-
chezs collie i brought the car to a
halt intending to throw the body in
the car and take it back and bun- it
decently for i could see that the dog
was dead

  i slipped out from under the wheel
hurried over to it and started to pick
the vengeance of the dead



it up then i stopped stock-still in
horror the poor brutes throat had
been torn wide open around the
dogs neck there was a wide band of
white as is common in collies and
on that white fur there was a welter-
ing splotch of blood i bent closer
staring at the limp body in the glare
of my spotlight unable for a moment
to understand then i started back
with a sick gasp as i comprehended
it the throat had been torn open by
huge teeth a panther must have
killed the poor beast and my lights
must have driven him away from the
dogs body the blood wras still ooz-
ing out of the wound

  no i would never take that hideous
carcass back to natchez i picked it
up and hurled it far out of sight back
in the brush rushed back to my car
shaking like a leaf crowrded myself
under the wheel and let in the clutch
i knew my face must have been
ghastly but it was not strange that it
should be so had i said the world
wtas becoming insane it was becom-
ing a vast welter of nauseous filthy
madness in which anything might
happen and in which i could find
nothing to which i might cling and
save myself alive what in the name
of heaven could have killed that poor
dog unless it was a panther yet
memory reminded me that panthers
had long been extinct in that terri-
tory what wild and nameless terror
was loose on this mountain  this
mountain that had always been so
peaceful and restful to m father in
the past 

t let the old hammerton out to fifty
- miles on that mountain road not
caring what ruts  bumps were in
the way the hammerton was heavy
it would hold the road regardless of
its roughness far ahead of me i
heard a high scream and i stepped on
the brake involuntarily as i let up
the gas pedal the car slowed so
abruptly that the tires scraped and
rocked to a mere crawl again i

heard the scream i am not ashamed
to admit that i was afraid to stop the
car entirely i was about to step on
the gas again when i saw a figure
stagger out of the brush and halt in
front of me waving arms that formed
a signal for me to stop then i did
stop with something of relief it
was sneath

  as the car came to a halt he
waddled out of the road and came up
to the door and i saw that he was
drunk he leaned close seeing my
face by the dashlight and my relief
faded in another swoop of horror
his eyes wtere staring his loose
mouth jabbering insane meaningless
phrases the man had been fright-
ened almost into madness and per-
haps the only thing that had kept
him from insanity was the fact that
he was so infernally drunk that not
even his terror had sobered him
recognizing me he calmed a little

  for gawds sake let me into the
car with yuh he begged fairly
slobbering in entreaty gimme a
lift to the tool house on the track
gawd-i seen him do it again

  i motioned for him to get into the
tonneau and he fairly leaped over
the door and fell sprawling on the
cushions jabbering and mouthing to
himself that he had seen somebody
again

  i turned in the seat and barked at
him you saw what-whom talk
sense man whats the matter with
you what did you see

  he cowered on the rear seat
gibbering i seen him i tell yuh
back there by the road maybe half
an hour ago-maybe a hundred
years and he was doin it again
his voice rose almost to a scream the
scream i had heard before i stopped
my car he was doin it again

  doing what i shouted furiously
feeling the hair rising on my scalp
whom did you see and what was
he doing

  that damn captain sneath
moaned that pretty-faced hell-


weird tales

hound he-lie-his voice rose into
that unearthly scream again-he
was doin like i seen him doin in
no mans land only-only-there
it was men he killed-and this time
it was-natchezs eollie-dog

  i stared utterly frozen stiff with
horror then cold sober sense came
again to my aid the man had the
dts i shouted at him again
shaking myself violently into action
and reaching for the wheel

  youre drunk crazy drunk you
damned fool whered you get the
whisky

  out of your cellar lie whim-
pered natchez gimme it

  well youre drunk i sneered
at him half insane myself and
youre crazy in the bargain tarrton
was in bed asleep two hours ago
yeh and he was in his dugout
asleep when we seen him chan gin  into
a wolf among the dead men too my
buddy and me sneath came back
crazily but we seen him-and if
my buddy was alive hed back me up

in- 

  shut up i roared

  and mavbc i didnt step  the
gas then i wanted nothing so much
as to get to the railroad track and
ditch that drunken madman at the
tool house where he had asked to be
taken i wasnt ten minutes in
reaching it stopping the car and
ordering him out

  yeh ill go he slobbered at me
threateningly as he climbed over the
door and dropped heavily to the
ground but im cornin back to
that damn lodge of yours and stick
a knife in that guy like i done to

willotson him and willotson was
hell-hounds together i seen em i
tell yuh turnin to wolves and killin
and killin just for the fun of it i
followed em for hours before i got
sick and fainted and i followed
willotson two years before i finally
got him-

    get away from there  i bel-
lowed i couldnt stand any more

  i jammed down the gas pedal and
let in the clutch the old ilammerton
shot ahead like a locomotive with a
madman at the throttle i tell you
i was mighty close to being a mad-
man  the ghastly horror of sneaths
mouthings had shaken me to the soul
not that i believed any such out-
landish impossibilities for even a
fraction of a second but i was sick
to death at the mere thought of such
horrors being conjured up even in
the drink-sick brain of a beast like
sneath

  ill never know how i managed to
reach the town only to find that the
only doctor there was sick in bed him-
self with a bad attack of smallpox
and i had to turn around and race
back to the lodge alone i wondered
how id find natchez if hed be still
alive or if id find that the sluggish
heart in his breast was stopped
within a mile of the lodge i heard a
sound that chilled my spine and made
my hair stiffen on my scalp the
dogs were howling with an aavful
frightened howl what terror was
among them now was the ghastly
bloodthirsty monster that had killed
the collie after another victim  up
the road i tore the gas pedal down
to the last notch

the ghastly and terrible happenings at the lodge will
be told next month in the concluding
chapters of this story

halkwelus

then came darkness and
the spider horde

in the home of foo chong
merchant prince of los angeles
chinatown there were two
strange rooms the keys to their
two locked doors avere carried only
by foo chong himself

  foo chong had first planned the
rooms six months ago when they
brought to him the broken body of
his son aauth an expression stamped
upon the sensitive old-ivory features
of the motherless youth which
threatened a fate rather avorse than
death when days and then weeks
slipped by sealing the verdict of the
pacific coasts foremost brain spe-
cialists foo chong smiled sadly and
ordered that the tavo rooms be pre-
pared

  the first of the rooms of mystery

was equipped as a playroom its
gaily figured walls its pictures and
furnishings the toys scattered care-
lessly on the floor-all were of the
kind that would appeal to a very
young child yet the youth for
avhom the room avas prepared avas
nearly twenty in years on the very
threshold of manhood

  but foo chongs only son avould
be as a very young child for the
rest of his life the eminent brain
surgeons had said the jagged scar
beneath the crisp black hair had
healed months before but the deeper
injury that the crashing impact of
that cruel oav had avrought could
never be healed the youth avould
always be content with his toys on
the floor of the nursery room


weird tales

 the second of the two rooms
though it required days of work to
construct and weeks to equip com-
pletely was intended for less than a
single nights occupancy the guest
upon whom such a signal honor was
to be bestowed was bull partlow

  tt was late in the evening and foo
chong was spending his usual hour
in the nursery with his son when a
servant came with word that bull
partlow had at last been brought
to the place rising from his place
on the floor beside the slight silken-
clmd figure who was absorbed in con-
structing queer little houses from a
set of american building-blocks foo
chong carefully closed the door of
the room behind him and joined his
servant in the hall

  we found him who is called the
bull at the drill kin g-place of black
manuel in san pedro the niau told
his master  the bull had but
just returned this morning with his
ship from a long cruise to tahiti and
other islands of the southern seas
is he badly hurt

  he bears no injury save from the
drug which we slipped into his
drink he knew nothing of the long
automobile ride which brought him
here and he only now begins to re-
cover his senses from the drug
you have done yell foo chong
commended and handed the servant
a key take him to the little room
with the steel door bind him tight-
ly to the chair within but with his
back to the glass case in the floor
remove every particle of his cloth-
ing even his shoes then rub his
body well with the ointment which is
in a stone jar by the chair place
his watch beside the dagger on the
little table

  then stay with him until i come
and if you value your reason he
warned or your life itself touch
nothing in the room save as  have
directed 

  with a nod of understanding the
servant was gone

  foo chong returned to the nur-
sery come my son he said
gently it is time to go to bed

 the youth obediently left his
blocks where they had fallen and al-
lowed foo chong with tender prac-
tised hands to undress him as though
he were a babe in arms then after
he was tucked into bed the boy
smiled contentedly and dropped off
into sleep with the swift ease of a
tired child

  foo chong stepped softly over to
a corner of the room for a moment
he touched with caressing fingers the
carefully arranged instruments laid
ont there on a drawing-board placed
there in a vain hope that their once-
loved shapes might bring a ray of
light to the boys darkened brain
as he idly fingered the t-square and
the compasses foo chong thought
sadly of those days when his sons
keen young mind and sensitive fin-
gers were being trained for the mod-
em magic of a structural engineer

  foo chong sighed as he closed and
locked behind him the door of the
nursery room then he went to his
reckoning with bull partlow

it was a strange little room which
had been built behind the second
locked door from the center of its
ceiling there was suspended a single
electric light bulb the walls were
without windows or visible openings
of any kind except for a thin line of
latticework grating near the top
otherwise their flat gray surfaces
were as bare as those of a prison cell
scattered about the little room at
apparent random were half a dozen
small pieces of intricately carved
chinese furniture

  in he exact center of the floor
directly under the solitary light a
vivid white circle a yard and a half
in diameter had been painted with-
in this circle a peculiar glass case
with a heavy glass lid was set into
the floor in size and shape it was
the brass key



not nnlike a cheese-box its interior
fairly swarmed with horrid life

  foo chongs entrance was greeted
with a flood of foul-mouthed protest
and profane abuse from the hulking
apelike figure who was bound to a
chair between the glass case and the
door foo chong nodded a brief dis-
missal to the servant then with
folded arms he studied his captive
in silence for a moment

 the mark of the beast was
stamped indelibly upon the heavy
features of the man before him the
full lips squat nose and heavy lower
jaw hinted at the mixture of races
which had produced an ideal speci-
men of harbor bruiser and deep-
water bully the bulging muscles
on mighty shoulders and powerful
torso bespoke the origin of the name
bull his naked body smelled
pungently of the strangely scented
ointment with which it had been
rubbed

  and so you are bull partlow
foo chongs voice was very quiet
the bull partlow upon whose ship
my son stowed away six months ago
for the adventure of a trip up the
coast from san pedro to portland

  i didnt know the whelp was
yours growled the bound giant in
surly defiance

  that matters not you do know
that my son never got to portland
he was found on the waterfront at
san francisco with his skull frac-
tured and at the point of death for
you had found him in his hiding-
place partlow and dragged him out
to work his passage that was not
amiss but when my sons strength
failed him at the unaccustomed la-
bor you beat him then avhen he
fell to the deck unconscious from
your blows you kicked him in the
head he did not regain conscious-
ness and becoming frightened you
left him at san francisco to die

  i didnt kick him in th head
partlow protested thickly he hit

his head again somethin when he
fell

  foo chong leaned forward and
gazed deep into the others eyes
for a long moment their wills met
and battled then partlow sudden-
ly looked away with a muttered
oath

  aw whats the difference he
snarled yeh i did it-i kicked
him then squaring his shoulders
with a return of bravado   what re
yuh gonna do about it th kid
didnt die did he

  no my son did not die agreed
foo chong softly it would have
been better if he had

  there was another long moment
of silence until partlow began to
fidget uneasily then foo chongs
even tones continued

  i am going to exact the price of
your evil act from you partlow i
have prepared a little game of wits
which you and i shall play

  keeping carefully away from his
bound captives hands foo chong
spun the others chair about until
partlow faced the glass case then
he watched the mans face blanch in
sudden terror as he saw the fearful
contents of the case for the first time

  there was ample reason for part-
lows fear a frail glass case filled
with living specimens of the great
tree spider of papua is not a pleasant
sight to see suddenly at ones very
feet with sprawling hairy legs
spanning seven inches and bloated
pursy body two inches in length the
creature is a monstrous abnormality
which only the nightmare depths of
a tropical jungle could spawn

  the glass ease literally swarmed
with the great spiders its floor and
its glass walls were carpeted every-
where with the surging silken-brown
creatures in the stillness of the
cell-like room the slithering sound of
the myriad groping legs was faintly
audible as the horde surged in cease-
less activity over the smooth walls
of the cage


weird tales

    some where within the four walls
of this little room foo chong ex-
plained quietly is hidden a small
key of brass it is possibly two
inches in length and has a handle
in the design of a scroll it is the
key to the door if you succeed in
finding it you are free to go when
you will unmolested

  you have two hours in which to
search for the key at the end of
that period the timing mechanism of
the case will cause the lid to rise and
the spiders will be liberated into the
room as the lid of the case rises
the light will be extinguished your
body has been anointed with an oil
which is a natural lure for the
spiders it should be only a moment
or so in the darkness before the horde
is swarming over your bare skin
the least tampering with the case if
you even touch a finger inside the
white circle on the floor will bring
the end at once

  but there is one alternative
foo chong gestured to where a
heavy dagger of oriental workman-
ship rested on the polished top of a
small table if your search for the
key is in vain and your courage
fails you as the light darkens and
the spiders come forth the blade of
the dagger may bring you a quicker
and more merciful release-if you
care to take it

 you have two hours then if
your search fails you face either the
spiders or the knife it should be an
interesting game part low

  as foo chong finished partlow
with an effort forced his gaze from
the spider cage at his feet and twist-
ed in his chair to look his captor in
the face the deep-set eyes of the
bull were clouded as his slow brain
seemed to struggle to realize the sit-
uation then realization apparently
came and stark murder flamed sud-
denly in the smoldering eyes

  with a sudden convulsive strain-
ing of every muscle in his powerful
body partlow wrenched himself to

his feet as though the heavy chair
to which he was bound were a toy
and hurled himself at foo chong in
one desperate mighty effort to crush
and destroy the slight figure before
him the attempt failed by inches
warned by the flash in the others
eyes foo chong stepped swiftly
aside even as the bound figure
crashed to the floor foo chong
clanged shut the steel door of the cell
behind him

  as foo chong entered his own
room next door he glanced at the
clock on the table before throwing
the switch that set in motion the
timing mechanism of the spider cage
eleven oclock at  the mechan-
ism would function if it were not
disturbed before

tpoo chong turned out the light

  then crossed the room and as-
cended a short flight of steps leading
to a small platform high up along
the wall which separated the room
from the cell next door a cunning-
ly concealed opening in the grating
near the ceiling of the cellroom en-
abled foo chong though impossible
of discovery himself to see and hear
every detail in partlows prison as
though he were actually with him
leaning forward in his chair on the
platform foo chong settled himself
patiently to his long watch

  brief though the interval had
been partlow had nearly freed him-
self from the bonds that lashed him
to the wrecked chair the last of
the weakened strands snapped in one
mighty effort and the bull
shambled to his feet

  for a brief time he stood there
half crouched with long arms tensed
at his sides his groat chest rising
and falling from his recent exertions
and his little blodshot eyes darting
swift glances to either side like
those of an animal at bay then
as the minutes passed without event
his tension gradually relaxed

  then as though finally deciding
the brass key



that he was really left to his own
devices he went into action step-
ping over to the door he gave a ten-
tative wrench at the handle then
beat testingly upon it with his hands
not satisfied he swept up the heavy
chair to which he had been bound
and swinging it lightly aloft rained
crashing blows upon the door

  the heavy piece of furniture splin-
tered into kindling wood  the steel
panel apparently realizing then
the futility of escape in that direc-
tion partlow began ranging the
four walls with the quick restless
tread of a caged jungle beast he
began a careful series of blows upon
the walls as high as he could reach
striking with the heel of his hand
and listening for the hollow sound
which might denote a weak spot he
found none

  then for the first time since foo
chong had left the room partlows
gaze returned to the cage of the
spiders the sight of the writhing
brown horde within its glass walls
had the electrical effect of a dash of
ice-cold water snatching up his
watch from its resting-place beside
the dagger on the little table he
scanned the face of the instrument
with feverish interest

  fifteen minutes had gone

  partlow licked lips that seemed to
have gone suddenly dry and began
to search for the key in earnest

  he studiously kept his gaze avert-
ed from the cage of the spiders as
he set to work upon the bizarre fur-
niture of the cell there were six
pieces in all they included the
little table where the dagger and the
watch rested the chair to which he
had been bound and four pieces
whose myriad drawers and compart-
ments might have adapted them for
almost any purpose except for the
chair all ihe pieces were of oriental
design and workmanship avith their
intricately carved surfaces and re-
cesses offering hiding-places for a
hundred keys

  selecting a piece at random part-
low searched swiftly through its vis-
ible drawrers and compartments at
the end of his fruitless search with
a dozen or more empty receptacles
strewn about him on the floor ho
paused for a moment baffled

  then his groping fingers blun-
dered upon a hidden spring he
grunted in satisfaction as a tiny se-
cret drawer slid open the grunt
changed to a muttered curse when
he found the drawer empty but the
incident spurred him on to renewred
efforts

  the piece proved to be literally
honeycombed with secret drawers
and nooks which came to light as
the concealed springs were pressed
by partlows clumsy fingers but one
by one the hidden spaces proved
empty and without trace of the brass
key

  the possibilities of the first pieco
apparently exhausted partlow
passed on to the next the second
piece of furniture was nearly as well
equipped with hidden niches as the
first but the search for the key con-
tinued fruitless save for an occa-
sional disappointed oath the search-
er worked in grim and tense silence
at constantly shortening intervals
he glanced at the watch setting to
work again each time with a new
and more feverish energy as he
noted the passing of the precious
minutes

  twelve oclock only one hour
more

  every piece of the six had been
ransacked without result in grim
desperation partlow now began
work on the skeleton framewrork of
the furniture tearing the joints
apart with his bare hands

  a quarter past 

  partlows face showed that the
strain was beginning to tell streams
of sweat bathed his swarthy fea-
tures his heavy lips began to
creep back from his teeth in a set
snarl of terror heedless of sharp


weird tales

edges and jagged splinters he con-
tinued to tear at the wooden frag-
ments with raw bleeding fingers in
feverish and ever growing despera-
tion

  twelve-thirty only half an hour
more

  partlows nerve seemed breaking
with ghastly swiftness until he
threatened momentarily to give way
blindly to sheer panic the watcher
in the room next door sighed softly
foo chong might almost have felt
compassion for that pitiable figure in
the cell had it not been for another
image which loomed before him-
that of the other room with a locked
door where a slender youth with
listless eyes spent his days putting
together endless little houses of
building-blocks

  only thirty minutes left in which
to find the precious key of brass and
it seemed that every possible hiding-
place in the cell had been searched
but after all-was there not at least
one place left untouched appar-
ently struck by a sudden thought
partlow glanced tentatively at the
cage of the spiders

   visibly shaken at the sight he
shuddered but he steeled himself
to look again his eyes staring and
intent as they searched for a telltale
glint of brass beneath that surging
horde of pursy brown bodies and
writhing legs slowly and unwill-
ingly he forced himself to approach
the case more closely

  finally he was kneeling on the
floor beside it his hands resting just
outside the warning white circle
his face was not a yard from the
glass of the ease itself the prox-
imity nearly proved fatal

  as he gazed at the horrid inhab-
itants of the cage sprawling in hid-
eous array so near his eyes part-
lows swarthy features slowly went
ashen his lips opened in horror
while with fascinated eyes staring
with hypnotic intentness he began
slowly swaying back and forth

threatening momentarily to topple
over on the case in utter collapse

  foo chong watched breathlessly
as the seconds passed and a prema-
ture climax loomed imminent then
at the last moment partlow
wrenched his gaze away as though
breaking a physical bond and threw
himself backward from the case

cor the next quarter of an hour it

	was little more than a madman
who raged up and down within the
confines of the cell-a madman who
beat wildly upon door and walls with
clenched fists and who chattered
mingled curses and prayers as he
pawed frenziedly with bleeding fin-
gers among the scattered scraps of
wood in a last sobbing effort to find
the key then the reaction came
swiftly and he sank to the floor
crouched on his haunches in a listless
stupor

  it was five minutes of  when he
roused himself from his lethargy of
despair

  he lifted the watch with a shaking
hand as he read the dials fateful
message the timepiece slipped from
his limp fingers and clattered un-
heeded to the floor no need now for
a measure of the few precious mo-
ments remaining

  foo chong leaned forward with
new intentness at his vigil

  with movements as deliberate and
mechanical as those of a sleep-
walker partlow picked up the heavy
dagger and turned to face the glass
case

  four minutes of 

  was it imagination or was the
light in the cell now tinged with a
faint reddish hue-and was the
heavy lid of the spider cage trem-
bling ever so slightly upon its sup-
ports

  three minutes-and doubt became
awful certainty

  the light from the solitary bulb
was now dimming swiftly its fila-
ments fading to loops of vivid red
the brass key



and the lid of the ease was slowly-
rising partlows grasp upon the
dagger tightened

  two minutes

  with eyes that sought to pierce
the crimson gloom partlow saw the
lid of the case yawn until the crev-
ice was fringed with twitching legs
as the great spiders swarmed at the
opening the mans face writhed in
a ghastly grimace as though he al-
ready felt the touch of those hateful
bodies swarming over his bare skin
with poison fangs bared to strike
he raised the dagger until its point
rested just over his heart

  one minute

  the light was now but a dim red
glow the lid of the case seemed ris-
ing more swiftly suddenly from be-
neath its edge the first of the spiders
dropped pushed through the crevice
by the surging bodies behind

  the creatures pursy body struck
the floor with a slight but audible
thud for a second it sprawled
there with forelegs twitching then
scuttled straight for partlow

  it was the end

  partlow whimpered aloud as he
convulsively drove the daggers
blade home

  as he lurched to his knees a small
object tinkled to the floor in front

of him gropiug for a moment on
all fours he sought with fast-glazing
eyes to identify the object then al-
most with his last breath he cursed
aloud as he realized the truth

  it was the key to the door that
lay before him there on the floor-a
small key of brass with a handle of
scrollwork the twisting blow as he
had driven the blade of the dagger
home had released the key from its
hiding-place in the hollow handle of
the weapon

  partlow made a last convulsive ef-
fort to grasp the key but his ebbing
strength was not equal to the task
his clutching fingers fell short by
inches as he sprawled limply for-
ward on his face

 then came darkness and the
spider horde

a s foo ciiong rose from his post of
vigil and stretched cramped
limbs he smiled gently to himself
but there was no hint of gladness in
that faint smile

  for foo chong was again think-
ing of that other strange room the
nursery where toys and childs
building-blocks were scattered care-
lessly on the floor like shattered
fragments of some tenderly cher-
ished dream
the port of la rixayra does
not boast of a harbor so that
when i came to board the
emperatriz i was forced to charter
one of the local ruffians to ferry me
across the half-mile or so of sea
which separated her from the mole
viewed from the shore the ship-a
tramp steamer of some  tons-
had seemed smart enough but i
quickly discovered that in her case
distance decidedly did lend enchant-
ment to the view for a nearer
approach rendered only too obvious
her dingy sun-blistered paintwork
and her rust-streaked dented plates

but i was not in a position to be
over particular-anything that was
capable of floating and bearing me
out of venezuela would have looked


good to me just then my last voy-
age had terminated with some abrupt-
ness owing to a difference of opinion
with the guardaeostas farther down
the coast they had pried open some
of the cases hi our hold which
were down in the manifest as
machinery and found them to
contain machine-guns in con-
sequence for the past three weeks it
had needed all my ingenuity to steer
clear of the local carcel so that when
a greasy garlic-scented individual
had sidled up to me with the offer of
a berth i had not asked too many
questions before accepting

  the moment i clambered aboard i
was confronted by a red-faced giant
clad in a uniform cap and a suit of
pajamas i handed him the agents
the ghost ship



letter by way of introduction but he
merely glanced at the superscription
and handed it back

  my names hawes and im first
mate of this old water-pusher  he
told me the new captain hasnt
come aboard yet

 the new captain my voice
must have betrayed my surprize

  lie nodded his eyes fixed on mine
the while we lost the old man
and the second mate coming down
they died of fever

  both of them i cried

  ay-its been a sickly trip
then he turned and walked aft as
a hint that the interview was
finished

  this certainly did not sound very
reassuring but i made no comment
as i descended to my cabin and
proceeded to stow away my traps
then after having a cursory look
round i went on deck for a quiet
smoke

  the fiery copper-red disk of the
sun was just preparing to dip behind
the western horizon tinging every-
thing with its fierce and vivid hue it
turned the waters op the roadstead to
a pool of molten gold it smote upon
the mountains which like mighty
bulwarks tower above the little port
turning their jagged peaks to flaming
beacons against the cold purple shad-
ows of the coming night slowly the
sun disappeared for a brief instant
the red afterglow hovered high up in
the zenith then with the abruptness
of an extinguished candle it was night

  i was just on the point of turning
in when i noticed a shore boat head-
ing toward us and t at once
concluded that it must be bringing
the new captain being somewhat
curious to know what sort of a ship-
master they had managed to pick up
in that out-of-the-way port i shifted
my position so that i could sot an
uninterrupted view of the accommoda-
tion ladder scarcely had i taken
my stand than the boat came along-
side and a tall man sprang nimbly on

to the grating our navigation lights
had already been shipped prepar-
atory to putting to sea and as he
paused to pay his boatman the green
rays of the starboard light fell full
upon his face the unreal ghostly
glare revealing a countenance so
striking and unusual that it has
remained indelibly photographed on
my mind

  in former days he must have been
more than passably handsome for the
features were regular and finely
formed but now they were seamed
with deep-graven lines which spoke
of every base and lawless passion i
do not suppose that jic was more than
fifty at the most for the full beard
showed no trace of gray and his step
as he mounted to the bridge was
qxiick and firm but he appeared like
a man who had drained the cup of
life until nothing but the very dregs
remained and in the depths of his
sunken eyes there lay a look at once
apprehensive and defiant of a man
who is dogged by some iong-feared
unavoidable fate ip it be possible
for a man to be haunted in this
world i found myself muttering as
i turned away then that man is

  but haunted or not captain
frcwin seemed a capable seaman
orders followed each other in quick
succession the ancient winch on the
forecastle wheezed and leaked steam
as the anchor was hove short and
hoisted then taking the wheel him-
self he ordered full speed and
the old lumbering freighter came
round like a yacht and set her bows
to the broad atlantic

  our voyage had begun little did
i-or any aboard-dream how it was
to end

once clear of soundings it is
remarkable howr quickly you
settle down to the routine of ship-
board life all ships are broadly
speaking very much alike and the
round of duties practically the same
but ones shipmates are likely to vary


weird tales

considerably and i must admit that
mine on board the emperatriz did
not endear themselves to me on closer
acquaintance to put the matter
bluntly i do not think a more out-
and-out mob of incompetents and un-
desirables were to be found in the
length and breadth of the seven seas
and my estimate of their character
was upheld by the mature experience
of the chief engineer who had
probably sailed the seas for as many
years as i had months like so many
of his calling he was a scotsman
hailing from that home of engineers
-clydeside he was a kindly old
soul with an intense appreciation of
everything which had its origin in his
native land from ships engines to
whisky no sooner did he learn that
my mothers name had been camp-
bell and that i had served in one of
the kilted regiments in the war than
he took me-metaphorically-to his
oily bosom with all the patriotic
fervor of the true scot

  ive nae wish tae appear in-
quisitive laddie he said to me one
night as we sat smoking but hoo
comes ye tae be aboard a packet like
this

  i told him what had happened at
la guayra and he nodded sympa-
thetically

  ay ay tis the same auld tale the
world over obey the orders if ye
brak the owners and obey the
owners if ye brak yerself ill no
be denying that  was a wee bit under
a cloud when i signed on here-other-
wise id no be doctoring the heap o
scrap that masquerades as engines
aboard this ship losh laddie but
were a fine gay shipload i dinna
think theres a mon of us but whats
got a mark agin his ticket an im
no excepting the skipper for hes
got the blackest mark o the lot

     captain frewin   i cried   how
could he get command if his certifi-
cate were not in order

  mcpherson laughed and spat con-
temptuously over the side

  the dago firm that owns the
emperatriz are nae so particular as
tae yon mon i tell ye theyd
employ a deil red-hot frae hell so
longs he could handle a ship and
came cheap enow as for the skipper
theres no a reputable shipowner
thatll employ him since he piled up
the valhalla in 

  how did it happen i asked
scenting a yarn

  he was a guid five miles oot o
his course i was on the ship as
fourth engineer at the time and i
canna help thinking the mon was just
demented  

 drunk

 ay-but no with liquor he
was just mad with love for one o
the lassies on board mind ye the
captain was a smart young fellow in
those days and the valhalla was his
first command she was a big twin-
screw passenger and cargo steamer
running between london and the
australian ports by way of the cape
of good hope it was on the return
trip of her maiden voyage that it
happened

  wed had fine weather most all
the way across and it looked like as
if we were going to make what in
those days was considered a record
run we were three parts of the way
across the bay of biscay and we
expected to be off the wight by the
following morning so the passengers
had made up a merry party in the
saloon to mark the last night of the
voyage puir souls twas the last
night o life for mony a one of
them -

  during the last part of my spell
in the engine room id heard the fog-
horn going but as wed had nae
orders to slacken her down i thought
wed run into a bit of a haze in the
channel but ma conscience when
i cam on deck i got the shock o ma
life it was thick as pea-soup and
there we were snorting along as
though we had the open sea in front
of us as i looked at the bow-wave
the ghost ship



over the side i remember asking my-
sel  what sort of a captain it was who
risked precious lives to pull down a
bit of a speed record but that
wasnt the worst either instead of
being at his post on the bridge where
dye think capn frewin was in
the saloon whispering sweet nothings
into the ear of his lady-love i
looked through the saloon skylight
and i see him wi ma ain eyes else
i never had believed it possible

  mind ye im no saying but that
they made a well-matched couple he
was good-looking more n common
and so was she though in a different
sort o way she was as fair as he
was dark with long curling hair
yellow as the sands of the sea when
the sunlight falls on it she used to
wear a dress of some green silky stuff
which somehow always seemed to
remind me of wet seaweed-every-
thing aboot her from her coral-red
lips to her little shell-like ears
reminded you of the sea as i peered
at her i couldna help thinking shed
make a bonny sailors bride but
this was nae time for love-making as
they were very soon to find out

  presently someone struck a few
bars on the piano and the young
lassie began to sing eh but she had
a sweet tender voice there was nae
fancy trills and screeches aboot it
like ye sometimes hears on the stage
but it seemed to gang straight to
your heart as i stood listening to
it i forgot the ship i forgot the fog
i forgot the rocks of ushant and
dootless the capn did as weel he
sat there drinkin in the melody like
a man fascinated-bewitched before
shed finished one of the officers from
the bridge came to the saloon door in
his wet oilskins and whispered in the
capns ear but he waved him away
impatiently and turned again to the
girl it must ha been some impor-
tant message for i saw the mon raise
his eyebrows when it was ignored
and so it went on-the ship racing
ahead the song floating up sweet and

low as the lapping of the waves
when the tide is on the turn the blar-
ing of the foghorn overhead   

  weel the crash had tae come and
come it did ye can imagine what
happens when a -ton boat takes
a sunken reef at full speed it just
ripped the keel clean out of her and
doon she went to the bottom like a
stane taking with her maist o the
passengers and crew i was one of
the lucky ones i managed to get to
the shore and so did captain
frewin

  and the girl in green-what be-
came of her

  nae doot she went doon with the
ship for she was never seen after-
ward replied mcpheison the
capn was like a madman for days
searching the seashore for her body
cursing the sea that had stolen her
from him that nights work ruined
him body and soul and sometimes i
think it would ha been better for
him if hed gone to the bottom with
his ship

  and i remembering the look i had
seen in his eyes when first we met
felt inclined to agree

we skirted along the coast
passed the island of trinidad
then set our course almost due east
for our next port of call was free-
town sierra leone there we lay for
over a week while a gang of negro
stevedores leisurely discharged part
of our cargo afterward loading us
with bales of copra and barrels of
palm-oil until we were down to our
plimsoll s mark once more clearing
from there we began to round the
great shoulder of africa making for
our final port london

  on the third day out when i came
on the bridge to relieve the first mate
at eight bells noon i found him
staring aft through the binoculars
so engrossed was he that he failed to
note my approach until i touched
him on the arm then he handed me
the glasses


weird tales

  what do you make of that trail
of smoke on the horizon he asked
in a slightly puzzled tone at the
same time indicating a spot about
three points off the starboard quarter

  i focused the glasses and took a
long look it belongs to a fairly
big ship with two funnels i said
presently

  two he asked quickly

  sure i can distinctly make out
the two plumes

  he looked at me and rubbed his
hand thoughtfully across his chin
well thats damned queer he
muttered

 how

  its mighty seldom that you come
across a slow cargo steamer with a
couple of smokestacks twin-funneled
craft are usually liners of sorts and
have some turn of speed our old
tub is barely making eight knots yet
that ship has kept the same position
right from the moment we left free-
town why she should have over-
hauled us days ago

  perhaps shes developed trouble
in her engine room   i suggested

  hawes face lit up at my words
hopes of salvage are never far
distant from a sailors thoughts and
a broken-down liner in need of a tow
might mean a small fortune but the
next moment he was shaking his head
despondently

  whatever her game is shes still
capable of keeping under way no
chance of earning the price of a free-
hold farm ashore this trip worse
luck and with a disgusted glance
astern he turned and quitted the
bridge

  at intervals during my watch i
glanced toward that distant smudge
on the horizon but its position with
regard to our own ship appeared to
be unchanged at eight bells the
captain came on the bridge and it
was at once clear that he was not in
the best of tempers

  anything to report he growled

as he came across to take a squint at
the compass

  theres a liner astern that seems
to be making poor speed sir
indeed he favored me with a
sardonic grin   what then  do
you want me to unship my donkey-
engine and make em a present of it
to help em up to time

  if we slowed down a few revolu-
tions so that she could come up with

us- i began but he cut me short

as though the suggestion were a
personal insult

  slow down nothing my econom-
ical speeds seven-point-eight and
thats what im going to steam at-if
theres fifty flaming liners astern
havent i got troubles of my own
without seeking otheis if shes in
distress why the blazes dont she
send up rockets didnt they teach
you any sense in the girls school
where you learnt navigation keep
her as she goes quartermaster

  for a moment i boiled inwardly at
the open affront then with an
effort i choked down the words i was
about to say and touching my cap
with what i intended to be a dignified
salute i went below

  my next spell of duty was the
morning watch and as soon as the
sun was up i found my eyes turning
toward the strange ship there she
was in the same position as before
no nearer no closer the respective
positions could not have remained
more constant if an invisible tow-
rope had connected the two ships

  it does not take much to set mens
tongues wagging at sea by this time
the news of the strange behavior of
the unknown vessel had penetrated
even to the stokehold i heard two of
the firemen discussing it half jest-
ingly as they performed their ablu-
tions after coming off duty

  we re bein shadowed thats
what it is matey declared one
  got anyfink on yer conscience
ginger
the ghost ship



  not arf so much as wot the old
man has if all yer ears abart im
is right struth ive got through
a few mucky jobs in my time but i
reckon im a plaster himage com-
pared with im who the ell is it
thats following us

 never heard of the phantom
ship ginger grinned the first
speaker shes been fitted out with
triple expansions specially to bring
us the sailors last warning mark
my words this old hooker is going to
make her last big ole in the water
before long

despite the contempt with which
he had greeted my reference to
the subject i could see that as the
time went on captain frewin began
to grow uneasy in his mind many a
time i caught him glancing furtively
at the faint and distant blur that
followed so persistently in our wake
but it was not until a week had
passed that he made the first move to
solve the mystery

  a big p  o mailboat had been
sighted ahead traveling in the
opposite direction to ourselves when
she was but a mile distant captain
frewin suddenly rang off the
engines and the emperatriz grad-
ually losing way remained motionless
save for the slow movement imparted
to her by the long atlantic rollers
attracted by the unusual maneuver
the approaching boat shifted her
helm and bore down a string of
colored bunting breaking from her
forward signal yard	

  what ship it said

 emperatriz freetown to lon-
don was our answer

  ballarat for adelaide are you
in need of assistance

  no stopped because of heated
bearing good-bye pleasant voy-
age

thanks same to you good-bye
as the ocean greyhound again
settled into her stride  turned my
eyes toward the distant smoke of the

mystery ship as i looked i felt my
breath catch in my throat for the
thin double plume soared straight
upward in the breathless air show-
ing that like ourselves the stranger
had hove to there could be no doubt
about it now-she was dogging us
but why

  i faced about and looked at captain
frewin he was standing motionless
on the swraying bridge his eyes fixed
on the ballarat which having swung
past us was now rapidly approaching
the unknown ship minutes passed
and still he made no attempt to resume
our voyage what was he looking at
what was he expecting to see why
had he stopped the ship in mid-
ocean then like a thunderbolt from
a clear sky the answer came

  i felt a hand grip my arm and an
awestruck voice whispered into my
ear in broadest doric

  canna ye understand mon the
ballarats passing her-passing a
stationary liner without sae much as
a dip of her ensign an ill tell ye
for why they canna see her shes
a ghost ship haunting us alone
shes the old valhalla following the
mon who sent her to the bottom
twenty-two years ago and-shes
freighted with the dead

the last days of that voyage will
ever remain in my memory like a
ghastly nightmare there are some
superior people who declare that the
advent of steam has caused the sailor
to abandon his old superstitions but
the dread of the unknown and un-
knowable has its roots too deeply
planted in the human soul for that
to be if those armchair psychol-
ogists who lay down the law so glibly
could have seen the demeanor of our
crew during the next few days they
would have had reason to revise their
opinions the men went about their
duties sullen and fearful the gloom
oi impending tragedy hung over the
whole ship mutterings and sidelong
glances told of smoldering mutiny


weird tales

i firmly believe it was only the open
display of the revolvers which each
of the officers carried that prevented
them rising in a body and heaving
the skipper overboard

  tension was at its highest when
there came a sudden change in the
weather the  i sh t southwesterly
wind which had accompanied us for
the past two days gave place to a
baffling mist while the slow oily
swell changed to a heavy head sea
with our engines slowed down imtil
they only gave us steerage-way and
with extra lookouts posted round the
ship we slowly crawled ahead the
only sounds were the steady pounding
of our screw deliberate now as the
drum in a funeral march and the
wail of the siren as it sent its eldritch
warning over the mist-hung waters

  it was during a pause between the
blasts that we seemed to hear a faint
ccho coming out of the white
obscurity immediately the lookout
hailed the bridge 

  big steamer in the offing sir
  where away

  after a pause the answer came
seems dead astam sir

  frewin gave a low-voiced order
and the quartermaster shifted the
spokes of the wheel

  again came the faint deep-boom-
ing sound and again the lookout
hailed

  steamer coming up astarn sir
captain frewin turned to the
steersman keep her off another
point then to hawes give a
toot to let em know theres someone
in their track

  the first mate raised his hand to
the lanyard and a long-drawn blast
of our foghorn followed barely had
the last vibrations died away when as
if in mockery the uvom-w-o-o-o-m
of the other ships foghorn floated out
of the mist behind us this time it
was perceptibly nearer-so near
indeed that it seemed as if the ship
that sounded it must be traveling at

a speed that was in weather like this
nothing short of reckless

    i suppose the blighter thinks hes
got the ocean to himself i heard
hawes mutter these swell lin-
ers- the remainder of the sen-
tence was drowned in a frenzied shout
from aft

  big liner coming up astarn sir-
traveling fast

  not a cables length distant loom-
ing wan and spectral through the
misty veil there appeared the shadow
of a huge gray hull she was steam-
ing in the same direction as ourselves
and following the exact same course
her forestay masts and funnels lay
in one straight line showing that she
was bearing directly down on us her
sheer sharp bows pointed straight at
our stern

  in one mad lea hawes clutched
the handle of the engine-room tel-
egraph and threw it full over

  below there steam for full
speed he roared down the speak-
ing-tube open her out all you
know-its life or death at the
same time frewin rammed the helm
hard over to starboard

  like a tired horse that feels the
riders spurs the old freighter picked
up speed the slow drumming of
our propeller rose to a rapid tattoo
dense volumes of smoke began to roll
from our funnel as the stokehold crew
fired up the furnaces and the grow-
ing white cloud at the escape-pipe
told of the increased head of steam
which resulted from their efforts
while leep down in the fabric of the
ship the panting and groaning of the
worn-out engines proved that mc-
pherson was making the old emper-
atriz do her best

  but her best was poor enough
compared with that of the rushing
monster behind us her speed was
more than three times as great as
ours and she never wavered or
slackened in her headlong progress
yard by yard she began to overtake
us nearer and nearer drew her
the ghost ship



bows until i found myself watching
as though hypnotized the waves of
creaming foam which curved on
each side of her sharp forefoot as it
clove through the sea for a few
breathless moments it seemed as
if a collision were inevitable grasp-
ing the rail before me with all my
strength i waited for the crash every
nerve tingling with suspense nearer
and ever nearer she came until i
could count the very rivets of her
plates then the emperatriz slowly
came round to her helm and the
strange ship swept past with a bare
ten feet of water between her bows
and our propeller

  drawing a long breath of relief i
glanced at captain frewin heavens
what was the matter with the man 
surely the peril through which we
had just passed was not sufficient to
account for such a change his face
had turned a sickly grayish yellow
beneath its tan and wild panic shone
in his staring eyes his hand was
shaking like an aspen as he pointed
to the bows of the other ship which
now on a course parallel to our own
had drawn level with the bridge

  the valhalla his voice had
sunk to a hoarse croak my old
ship  

  my heart turned to ice as i realized
the meaning of his words i turned
my gaze upward-stared and stared
again for high up on the towering
side in huge golden letters that could
not be misread was blazoned the
name of the ship which twenty-two
years ago almost to the very day had
split on the rocks of hshant-the
ship whose bones at that moment lay
rusting on the sea-bed far below the
waters on which we sailed 

  like a man in a dream i read and
reread the gilded letters my mind
struggling to convince itself that the
whole thing was impossible--absurd
then my eyes fell upon the single
figure upon the liners bridge and
my mind struggled no more for
though his hair was a trifle daiker

and his figure more upright his face
was feature for feature the same as
captain frewins might have been
when he had paced the bridge ot his
first command in the full flush of his
early manhood and as i looked the
figure on the liner slowly raised its
hands to the peak of its uniform cap
and like an automaton controlled by
another will our captain did the
same for a full minute they stood
motionless the living facing his dead
self in grave salute then the liner
forged ahead and the curtain of fog
descended on it

  but not before i had caught sight
of another figure upon its decks-
the figure of a young girl in a sea-
green dress in a flash i remembered
the old engineers description of the
siren who had lured the captain to his
ruin yes it was she there was
the same pale face wonderfully
supernaturally beautiful the same
full coral-red lips now parted in a
smile so alluring that it seemed to
draw my very soul to her like a
com pass-needi e quivering to the north
her long hair bright as the sunlit
sand of some tropic isle flowed free
upon her shoulders and upon it the
drops of flying spray shimmered like
pearls

 lucy the cry came from
frewin like the wail of a soul in tor-
ment my lucy

  she leaned over the rail and
stretched out her arms toward him
and from her lips there burst a song
such as i have never heard before or
since i dont remember the tunc and
i dont remember the words-i f there
were words to it but it seemed to
tell of all that the sea can tell-of
smiling calms light breezes like
lovers sighs hurricanes tempests
the wild music of the breakers on lee
shores and of the cool green depths
in which the bones of drowned men
lay it was such a song as few mortal
men have listened to-and lived

  and so the ship passed on but
the moment her stem was clear


weird tales

prewin ground the helm a-port and
set our bows straight into her churn-
ing wake he gave no heed to the
compass-eard before him his eyes
were fixed in a stony stare ahead his
ears strained to catch the sirens song
that was leading him to destruction

  obedience to ones superior officer
comes as second nature on shipboard
but even discipline has its breaking-
point at all costs i must stop the
ship i stepped to the captains side

  beg pardon sir but had we not
better-

  he turned on me with a snarl like
a wild beast

  take your hand away from that
telegraph  i felt a cold circle of
steel pressed to the back of my neck
as he gritted out the words if you
attempt to move or cry out ill blow
your backbone through your teeth
dont you hear lucy calling me
there-there-i must go to her ive
waited for her too long

  from out of the mist came the
crooning song low and sweet as a
mother lulling her babe to sleep but
i had other things to think of duck-
ing swiftly i faced about there
was a crashing report almost in my
ear and a bullet sang past and buried
itself in the woodwork before he
could pull trigger again i had closed
with the madman striving to get
possession of ihe wheel but he
seemed to be endowed with the
strength of three i managed to wrest
the revolver from him but that only
gave him another free hand it
closed upon my throat with a grip of
iron as he forced me backward-till
my shoulders rested against the fore
dodger of the bridge i was like a
child in his grasp i felt my senses
swim

  then when everything was grow-
ing black around me i felt the touch
of cold metal against my face turn-
ing my eyes i caught the gleam of

brass and a wave of hope surged
through me it was the mouth of the
speaking-tube that communicated
with the engine room loosening my
grip on frewin i tore out the plug
and bent as near as i could to the
tube

    reverse the engines reverse for
your life mac - were heading
straight for-

 a sudden crash came from- our
bows the emperatriz stopped dead
staggered for a moment like a great
stricken beast then as she lurched
forward again there came a series of
long-drawn grinding wrenches as she
tore her keel into scrap-iron and
passed over settling fast into the
deep water that surrounds the out-
lying rocks of ushant

hen two days later i recovered

  	 full consciousness i was lying
in the hut of one of the kindly breton
fisherfolk and it was there that mc-
pherson told me of the last plunge of
the old emperatriz and the death of
captain frewin

 while supporting my senseless
body on an overturned boat the
engineer had seen him swimming
with slow and steady strokes for the
shore

  then straight in front of him
there appeared the woman frae the
sea her shoulders and breasts were
bare her hair was floating out behind
her like a golden cloud from her
lips there cam the same song as she
had sung the night the valhalla went
doon the old man told me i saw
her reach the struggling mon sawr her
slender white arms twine themselves
aroond him saw her wet lips red as
coral pressed to his then locked in
each others arms they slowly sank
and the green waters closed above
their heads and there theyll bide
until the sea gies up its dead

new england long before the tea

party-had suddenly and completely
disappeared simple enough the
newspapers implied a husband who
was not too attentive a secret
admirer-and flight to parts un-
known

  but in this implication the news-
papers were wrong-or at least only
half right mrs barringer granted
had departed for parts unknown
but it was not because of a too
indifferent husband nor was it due
to one of those unfortunate love af-
fairs that occasionally upset the most
solidly established homes there was
a different reason from either of these
behind her sudden disappearance-
a reason that goes back two hundred
and thirty years to the mysterious
labors of an elderly woman who lived


weird tales

and died with suddenness and vio-
lence in salem massachusetts

  to begin with boyd barringer was
not an indifferent husband there
never lived a man who loved more
profoundly nor who was more kind-
ly attentive than lie was to clara
barringer his wife and she in her
turn adored him too completely to
gaze at another man with more than
the casual glance of a stranger

  their very marriage is proof of
this love of theirs for clara
apprehensive of the curse that she
felt was laid upon her did not want
to inflict sorrow on boyd and for
months she held out against his
urgent pleading that she be his wife
that he continued to so plead until
he had won her in spite of her loving
fears and that she consented at last
to his pleading in spite of every
obstacle her harassed mind could
set forth indicates more than any
other circumstance the depth of their
affection for each other

  the scene in which boyd had
finally won over her unwillingness to
iisk bringing him harm was a stormy
one in some respects

  clara said boyd his hands
closing over her round ann arms
rather cruelly and his eyes searching
into hers clitra is there someone
else do you refuse me because there
is another man before me in your
heart 

  clara hesitated before answering
that question her eyes took in every
detail of the man before her with a
painful accuracy for she firmly
intended that they should never meet
again and she wanted a last mental
picture of him to carry with her

  boyd was rather tall but his in-
clination towrard heaviness took away
from his height wide thick shoul-
ders sloped into a powerful neck his
features were purposeful almost
rim a typical man of the business
world one would say successful and
commanding with not too much senti-
ment or dreamy nonsense to hinder

his path among the material things of
life but his eyes contradicted the
rest of his appearance deep bhie
they were almost like a womans in
their tenderness and understanding
his eyes lent a softness to his firm
mouth and took away some of the
harshness of his chin a man of ac-
tion with the eyes of a lover it is
small wonder that clara should find
it hard to utter the lie that was in-
tended to drive him away

  neveitheless driving her rebellious
tongue with her head instead of with
her pleading heart lie she did

  you have guessed it she said
looking straight into his eyes i
love another man that is why i can
never marry you

  but boyd had not been fooled he
had looked back into her own eyes-
those odd eyes of hers with the
spindle-shaped feline pupils-and he
had smiled

  you arent telling me the truth
clara thats not the reason why you
wont marry me are you still let-
ting yourself think about that fantas-
tic curse thats supposed to crop out
in your family tree sometime would
you actually let such an insane legend
keep us apart when we want each
other so badly

  its not aninsane legend clara
cried a break in her words look at
me just look at me cant you see
the seeds of fulfilment of that old
prophecy in my eyes in my head in
the very way i walk she began to
weep wildly her shoulders shaking
with incipient hysteria

  boyd attempted to calm her to
humor her

  come now he suggested lets
assume that this two-hundred-year-
old fable has some truth in it let
us do it the honor of investigating it
thoroughly so that our reason may
kill it forever you are too intelligent
to believe in such a fantastic old
wives tale without proof of some
kind show me the proof then and
tell me the whole history and if
a witchs curse



after i have heard it all i still want
you to marry me you will wont
you say you will dear

  how can i answer whispered
clara surely no one was ever in
such a position before but i will tell
you the whole story now instead of
the hints and snatches of it that i
have allowed you to hear wait just
a moment while i go up to the attic
-there is an old trunk there with the
documents and pictures relating to
my family history  

 ill go with you there is a
light up there good and boyd
followed her up the flights of steps
that ended under the gables of the old
stone house-and in a discover as-
tounding enough though of course
utterly unbelievable

the place in which a story is re-
lated has much to do with the im-
pression made by that story in the
full light of day in some prosaic
spot boyd would have laughed at the
crazy tale proof or no proof-as in-
deed he did next morning but up
there under the roof in the dim light
of a single small electric globe he
must have spent a most uncomfort-
able hour listening to claras incred-
ible history of a feud that had en-
dured for seven generations

  the big attic had been floored but
never finished off further like
square-hewn ribs the beams depended
overhead festooned with cobwebs
vague and uncertain in the illumina-
tion of the unshaded dust-crusted
light bulb the place was cluttered
with old chairs and tables with legs
like tentacles in the shadowy dark-
ness an eery spot certainly and al-
most too well fitted for claras words

  several very old chests were in a
far corner and one of these boyd
dragged out under the light at claras
request after a struggle with the
rusty catches this was opened reveal-
ing a miscellany or ancient garments
pictures and yellowed papers

  in  clara began dully a

solitary old woman lived in a shack
on the edge of salem massachusetts
she was supposed to have a son some-
where but no one knew for sure and
he never came to visit her she kept
herself alive by raising vegetables and
selling them or trading them to the
neighboring townspeople

  she must have been rather a re-
pulsive-looking creature - very old
and wrinkled with a long chin and a
long nose that almost met like pin-
cers due to her lack of teeth she
was not very clean and her mind
was a bit unhinged but she did no
one harm and avas not herself mo-
lested at least at tjie time my story
begins

  my mothers ancestors also lived
in salem-the manfred jones clan
there was among other children of
this family a brooding dark-haired
little girl by the name of emily-
my oavn ancestress here is a pic-
ture of her as a small child  

  clara handed boyd a miniature
rather dimmed by age but cleverly
done and quite legible it was the
picture of a girl of about eleven
years though the eyes dark and in-
tense looked older boyd gazed at
the picture with interest then handed
it back silently

 the old woman i spoke of had
often brought her vegetables to the
jones home and she met emily she
seemed immensely attracted to the
little girl but emily possibly be-
cause she was afraid aatould never
make up to her so it was that one
day avhen the old crone passed her
hand longingly oarer emilys fine dark
hair the girl squirmed out of her
grasp kicked and clawed at her like
a little animal and ran aavay then
from a safe distance she proceeded to
make faces at her and taunt her avith
her bent ugliness of age it was a
very regrettable thing but after all
it was natural in a child so young

 from that one scene grew the
shadow that has clung to my mothers
family ever since for the old woman


weird tales

hated the child from then on and
that hatred was mutual emily jones
went out of her way to invent pranks
to play on the woman and incited all
her little friends to do the same this
loo was regrettable but it was some-
thing any child might do

  it was in the early spring of that
year that queer tales began to get
around concerning the old lady
farmers complained that cattle sick-
ened when she looked in their direc-
tion a neighbor of hers said that
she had the evil eye in short all
the stock tales of a witchs persecu-
tion were told  her she began to
lie known as the witch of salem town
everyone avoided her no one bought
or traded for her vegetables and she
was near to starving to death

  the vague rumors concerning her
might never have amounted to much
the most rabid period of the witch
craze lasted only a year or so you
know and she might have weathered
the storm of the neighborhoods dis-
approval and fear very easily-but
for little emily jones

  with an intelligence older than
her eleven years emily took in all the
talk concerning the old woman she
hated with the petulance of child-
hood and as she listened she re-
membered a sentence that the crone
had flung after her when she was par-
ticularly annoyed at some prank the
little girl had played  her

   ill turn you into a cat emily
jones ill turn you into a cat if you
dont stop your nuisance folks say
im a witch well-a witch can turn
little girls into cats and thats just
what ill do to you emily jones

  that threat rankled in the girls
mind and it ripened and grew until
a thought flashed on her one day
suppose she pretended that the witch
really was turning her into a cat
what a joke that would be how it
would plague her

  old enough and intelligent enough
to reason thus far emily was yet
unable to go farther and realize the

extreme gravity of her plan she was
too young of course to understand
the strength of the feeling that was
gathering against the old hag

  so the child put her scheme in
motion   

  she began oneevening to crawl
catlike under the tables and chairs
mewing and scratching with imag-
inary claws at her brothers and sis-
ters she licked her arms with her
tongue and glared blankly about imi-
tating a cat with all the monkey
cleverness a child has for imitations

  naturally the father manfred
jones was astounded more he was
as badly frightened as a grown man
can be

     emily emily  he cried  what
in heavens name possesses you you
act as though you were bewitched

    am was the solemn answer
the old witch said she would turn
me into a cat and i can feel her
doing it now

  manfred jones was an influential
man also in common with a great
many other normally intelligent men
he believed in witchcraft lie took his
little daughters statement at face
value and proceeded against the so-
called witch with all the power at his
command

  in april of the year  he
urged action against the old lady in a
public hearing presided over by six
magistrates and four ministers of the
gospel so violent were his charges
and so high was feeling running
against the old woman that she was
promptly cried out  accused
formally of being a witch without
further ceremony she was thrown into
the crude town jail

  and now the girl emily was terri-
fied at the consequences of her
thoughtless prank she told of the
trick she had played she pleaded
that the old woman be released
swearing that she had made up the
whole thing but  one believed
her solemnly it was judged that
emilys denials were a further proof
a witchs curse



of the witchs guilt she had sent a
demon to the child which impelled
her to withdraw her charges

    the jailer an ignorant and super-
stitious man furthered the misfor-
tune of the unhappy woman he ac-
cused her of bewitching his stomach
so that it was seized by violent
cramps and this absurd utterly in-
sane charge wras the last straw the
people of salem were now so fright-
ened and angry that they visited the
magistrates in a body and demanded
that the witch be put to death

  the magistrates obeyed the peo-
ples wish they decreed that the
witch be hanged

  by some odd telepathy the crone
had a premonition of her fate at
the moment when the death deciee
was signed according to the jailer
she cried out and sank in a senseless
heap to the floor of the cell and then
comes the strangest part of all   

  when she iegainecl consciousness
she began to pace her cell like a
maniac shrieking and shaking her
fists theyre going to hang me
she shouted in her high shrill voice
theyre going to kill me and its
the jones brat thats the cause she
told them i said id change her into
a cat so theyre going to hang me

  and it was at this point the jail-
er said in his later account that she
stopped dead-still and raised her
joined hands as though she were
praying

   theyre killing me on the word
of a child she said harshly very
well-ill be quit with the child by
all the devils in hell by the stars in
heavens floor by all the ghostly
guards of that witchcraft of which i
am accused ill do as the child
charged i will change her into a
cat

  and there in that dimly lit cell
the desperate old hag squatted on the
dirt floor and closed her eyes and
mumbled and whined to herself and
back in the jones home emily half
sick with terror at the thing shed

done began to change under the very
eyes of her amazed family with
every syllable the condemned witch
uttered half a mile away the girl
jerked convulsively as though she had
been struck

  the pupils of her eyes quivered
and shook and finally became slitted
and catlike she began to crawl
around the floor in dead earnest now
mewing and spitting actually a fine
almost imperceptible growth of hair
like fur showed on her arms and the
backs of her hands

  well never know what dread
thing would have happened-for ac-
tion was swift in massachusetts in
 the mob poured down to the
jail with the death decree burst open
the doors and proceeded to hang the
witch from a beam in her own cell

  just before the final moment she
laughed a high empty awful laugh
youve got me now she screamed
but ill have my revenge if i must
wait till the seventh generation ill
have revenge

  and then the end she died with
a curse on her lips against the family
that had been the cause of her execu-
tion

clara shuddered and covered her
face with her hands and boyd
his own face ashen and his lips white
and dry drew her close to him

  a mad dangerous legend to let
live he whispered but clara-
my heavens surely you arent be-
lieving such a monstrous thing

  our ancestors in salem were
strong firm-minded material men
boyd if so many of such men be-
lieved in witchcraft-were so desper-
ately afraid of it that they took hu-
man life to protect themselves-it
would indicate that there is actually
something in the black art wouldnt
it

  impossible said boyd but
there was a shadow on his face that
contradicted the spoken word


weird tales

  anyway there are proofs said
clara drearily awful proofs
here are the records of the public
hearing where the witch was cried
out and here is the death warrant
and here is the document of manfred
jones she handed him a packet of
yellow papers documents but here
boyd is the most conclusive proof of
all-a picture of emily jones when
she was a woman years after the
witchs curse

  boyd was conscious of a shudder as
he looked into the miniature that
showed the girl emily grown up

  with uncanny intuition the artist
had caught at secret hidden things in
the sad face the eyes with their
spindle-shaped ominously slitted pu-
pils  the odd set of the head the hint
of unnatural hair in the shading of
the delicate upper lip all breathed of
unbelievable metamorphosis boyd
suddenly covered the picture with his
hand to shut out the queer eyes that
seemed to live and stare at him

  and my eyes too boyd clara
murmured reading his thought
they are the same and i-am the
seventh generation the witch with
her last breath said distinctly the
seventh generation and i am the
seventh  

  clara compose yourself dear
boyds face was white but steady
what you deduce the thing you
fear is not possible let us laugh at
this silly tale as it deserves and for-
get it forever clara-will you marry
me

    in spite of-of- 

 in spite of the legend of course
all the fairy-stories in the world
couldnt change my love for you
please

  he held out his arms and clara
doubting and wondering still but
tired to the death of bearing her
heavy burden alone crept close to
him and gave her promise

 just one thing more boyd
called out as he was leaving what
was the name of that old witch of

yours id like to look her up and
see from the records whether her son
was mythical or a real being who left
a family it might help make your
mind easy if i gather all the facts in
the case

  im not sure of her name said
clara slowly the records i have
are contradictory there the death
decree named her joan byfield but
in the minutes of the public hearing
she was written down as joan bas-
field i dont know which is correct  
basfield cried boyd startled
basfield clara tell me-is that
spelled with one s or two
spelled with one s  said clara
wondering at his excitement why
do you ask

  oh-nothing if it is spelled with
one s or if it was byfield it
couldnt be the same but - the
devil it couldnt be the same in any
event the very idea is preposter-
ous

  what are you talking of boyd
nothing dear said boyd re-
fusing to meet her puzzled eyes
nothing a foolish passing thought
of mine not worth mentioning
slowly he descended the steps his
head bent his thoughts far away

life flowed smoothly for boyd and
clara barringer

  realizing that setting is half the
trouble of any chronic mind disorder
boyd insisted on selling claras old
stone house putting the proceeds in
trust for her and shortly afterward
they moved down to new york

  the apprehension gradually faded
from claras eyes-those eyes with
the odd slitted pupils-and she wras
a normal loving wtife boyd was con-
tent to believe that the fantasy that
had festered in her brain since she
was a girl had faded from her con-
sciousness forever the aged docu-
ments treating with one joan bas-
field or byfield witch who went
about transforming little girls into
cats had been burned in the furnace
a witchs curse



with all the ceremony the rite de-
manded and the uncanny miniature
of emily jones had accompanied the
records into the fire

  clara moved contentedly and prosa-
ically about the handsome house boyd
had bought in new york and after
two years during which no shadow of
her delusion had obtruded boyd felt
that it was safe to make a request-a
request he would certainly have made
sooner had he not felt that trouble
might result from a certain similarity
of names

  clara he said casually one eve-
ning we have plenty of room here
i wonder if you would mind very
much if i had my aunt jane up for
a long visit  shes quite old and
helpless alone in the world do you
care if  invite her

  clara smiled that boyd was fond
of his mothers sister she knew well
quite often he had mentioned her
an old woman now but still almost
dismayingly clever she lived alone
with few friends and few interests in
life she was devoted to her favor-
ite nephew boyd clara wondered
idly why he had never asked to have
her visit them before and she found
liersclf eager to meet the woman who
commanded her mans admiring re-
spect and affection

  ill be glad to have her come for
as long as she wants dear she as-
sured him its a pity for an old
person to be alone as she is too bad
she hasnt a nice old husband to share
her life

  boyd grinned im afraid the
young men of her day and acquaint-
ance were too much in awe of her to
propose she had rather a sharp
tongue ive been told in addition to
too many brains for a proper wife
and her temper was notorious even
now shes a terror when anything
angers or upsets her anyway she
never married

  well ill write and ask her at
once boyd what is her full name
and address if youve ever called

her anything but just aunt jane i
cant remember it

  this under the circumstances was
a disturbing question and boyd had
dreaded it in spite of two years of
peace which had done so much to
erase the childish bogy of the witchs
curse from claras miud as he
answered he was very careful to seem
carelessly offhand

  her name he said lightly is
jane evers bassfield the address is
-why clara

  he caught her as she swayed and
seemed about to faint

  but claras surrender to old fears
was over in a few moments

  the names are so much alike
she explained later in the evening
joan basfield the witch-and jane
bassfield your aunt for an instant
i was rather startled im sorry to
be such a fool boyd

 i was afraid the name would
bother you boyd confessed or i
would have asked her here long ago
but now that you have cleared this
last hurdle i think we can safely say
that you are cured of your supersti-
tion-if you dont mind my calling a
spade a spade  

xxiien jane bassfield arrived in

  	 answer to her invitation clara
was further reassured obviously she
was a strong-minded prideful old
lady with her firm projecting chin
and arrogant nose and her eyes
were that cool gray that can he gla-
cial in moments of anger but her
manner was warm and charming in
the extreme

 ive been perishing to meet
boyds wife for two years but 
couldnt very well come without be-
ing invited and i was afraid you
didnt want to be bothered with dod-
dering old age show me the room
youve picked for me my dear and
come along and tell me how boyd is
treating you if lies a cruel hus-
band ill set the spirits on him 


weiei tales

  boyd hastened to answer the per-
turbed question that instantly rose in
claras eyes

  she means that shell disturb my
morning coffee by ghostly rappings
on the breakfast table he laughed
aunt jane is supposed to be psychic
and everything  

  are you-really asked clara
gazing wide-eyed at the vigorous old
woman and with that in her voice
that made boyd wince in alarm

  jane bassfield shrugged the ges-
t are seeming almost masculine

 who can say she evaded
everyone assures me so often that
psychic phenomena are all faked that
im beginning to believe it myself
but long ago i found that i could de-
fend myself from ignorant and un-
desirable people by claiming that i
was psychic it became and still is
a favorite threat of mine to set the
spirits on anyone who tries to cross
me heavens child dont look at me
like that i wont bite you

  she put her hand in a kindly way
over claras cold fingers seeming not
to notice when the younger woman
quickly drew away from her come
and show me your new house you
must be fearfully successful boyd to
buy such a tidy little mansion

                        

two days after jane bassfield ar-
rived claras maid agnes left
the barringer employ she left in a
panic at  oclock at night announc-
ing her change of heart packing her
belongings and fleeing out the front
gate all within one short half-hour

  to clara she gave no explanation
at all to her good friend beulah
the cook she gave a reason of sorts
but it avas so vague and unconvincing
that it was worse than no reason

  i dont see anything wrong with
old miss bassfield beulah had said
in answer to agnes statement that
she was leaving because of mr bar-
ringers aunt shes awful strong-
minded and kind of particular but
aside from that shes all right

   oh beulah you should have seen
what i saw just a few minutes ago
youd march right down and say you
were going to quit too  

  whatd you see

  well you know ive been waiting
on the old woman kind of since she
got here and mrs barringer said it
would be nice if i took her up a glass
of hot milk that was at half-past
 just a few minutes ago well i
heated some milk-you saw me-and
took it up to her

    i knocked on her door and didnt
get an answer so i just went in
thinking the old lady was asleep and
that id put the milk on the stand
near the bed for when she woke up
but she wasnt asleep

  i slipped in quiet and she didnt
hear me i guess she was sitting
straight up in bed with a niglit-cap on
and just that little night-light going
and then-what i saw

 well whatd you see asked
beulah impatiently

 shadows said agnes with a
tensity that would have been absurd
had it not been for the pallor of her
face

 what about the shadows
beulah urged her

  she was sitting so the night-light
threw a big shadow of her against the
wall and such a shadow the end
of her nose and the end of her chin
almost came together the night-cap
looked like a-a-i cant tell you just
what beulah all i can say is-she
looked like an old witch

  go on scoffed beulah you
a grown woman saying such things  
but that wasnt the worst said
agnes unheeding the jeer there
were other shadows sort of swimming
around hers on the wall they looked
like shadows of nightmare animals all
bowing and dancing around the
shadow of her head with the nose and
chin almost coming together but
when  looked at her and not at her
shadow i couldnt see any shapes of
animals around her it was only the
a witchs curse



shadows i could see agnes stopped
for breath

  then what prompted beulah

  isnt that enough the old lady
saw me standing there all of a sudden
and she glared like she was going to
jump at me her eyes were all
whites and she said get out you
and i got out and im going to
keep right on getting out beulah i
wont live in a place with anyone like
that honest i think she is a witch

 which met with the scorn it
deserved beulah was a realistic soul
and she treated agnes raving with
amused indifference but she was
nevertheless unable to persuade
agnes to change her mind and stay
under the barringer roof

it was soon after this that clara
barringer began to be troubled
with insomnia it was not the ordi-
nary affair of being unable to go to
sleep-it was a matter of being afraid
to let herself sink into slumber her
dreams were so hideous just what
these nightmares were she couldnt
have said herself she never remem-
bered any of them all she knew was
that they were utterly horrible and
left her weak and shaken in the morn-
ing

  boyd was more familiar with her
nightmares than she herself was-he
heard her mumbled feverish whisper-
ing during the night only too often
and piecing the broken snatches of
her sleep talk together and viewing
with alarm the delirious pattern the
words produced he went one day to
a famous mind specialist to him he
told the story of the fantastic curse
that haunted his wife and he
recounted the bits of sentences and
phrases that voiced her terror in the
nightmare-ridden night

  at the conclusion of the account
the specialist pronounced the same
opinion that boyd himself had
formed his aunt jane bassfield
must leve their home at once

  for there is no doubt my dear
man that the presence of your aunt
and the odd coincidence of names
have wrought up the feelings of your
wife to a dangerous pitch really i
couldnt answer for her sanity if the
disturbing element miss bassfield is
not removed at once

  and you think shell be herself
again as soon as my aunt leaves
boyds voice was shaken to the
doctor this was a most interesting and
intriguing case but to boyd it was
the anguish of his beloved wife

  im sure shell be all right when
your aunt leaves mr barringer
boyd hesitated an instant before
putting his next question he felt
like a fool but for the life of him he
couldnt restrain it

  then there is no danger of-of
this thing coming true there is no

chance that- he colored with

embarrassment

  no danger that the lady will turn
your wife into a cat the spe-
cialist s voice was as heavy with scorn
as he dared make it what with the
size of the fee he had in mind as
suitable for the barringer purse
hardly my dear fellow that is
a metamorphosis rather incompatible
with the best customs of biology

  i know it sounds ridiculous
boyd confessed but if you had
seen my wifes eyes last night her
eyes were always queerlv catlike and
last night they were enormous with

glints of green and yellow-

  mr barringer yoix will be my
patient too if you dont watch your
step use your reason man just
go out into the street here and watch
the motors and trolley cars go by and
to the accompaniment of that friendly
din say to yourself a dozen times-i
am afraid my aunt is going to change
my wife into a cat if that doosnt
make you roar with cleansing
laughter in about three seconds-
youd better come back here and take
a few treatments yourself

weird tales

jane bassfield took boyds awk-
ward attempts at mollifying
explanation better than he had hoped
she would indeed she seemed almost
to have suspected some such condi-
tion

  i was afraid that clara didnt
like me she sighed i have tried
hard to be friends but she seems
almost to fear me ill go imme-
diately of course

  with clara she seemed deeply
sympathetic

  im so sorry you havent been
feeling as avell as usual and im so
sorry i have to leave you-some busi-
ness matters at home that i must tend
to at once

  but lor one instant just before
train time she and clara were alone
and if boyd could have heard and
seen he would not have been so sure
that the mere withdrawal of his
aunt s presence would leave his wife
as she had been before the visit

  with her eyes gleaming like cold
fires the grim old woman whispered
one sentence to clara the words
wiped the color from the younger
womans face and sent the thick blood
rushing to her brain it confirmed
her every dazed suspicion and in-
dicating only one possible explanation
to her mind this sentence can be
pointed to as the final seal of her fate

    distance went stop me clara
jones and you know it-you who also
know the history of joan basfield
boyd was vastly disappointed that
day he had hoped to the last that
he could reconcile his wife to the old
jady so it was most unfortunate that
clara had suddenly become too ill to
accompany them to the train   

lara baeringers illness men-
mioned by the later newspaper
accounts of her curious disappear-
ance persisted from this time on in
thecourse of the next month boyd
called often at the office of the spe-
cialist in mind disorders

  can it be that there is something

physically wrong with her brain-
tumor or bone pressure or some-
thing he asked the doctor once
why do you ask

  because she is suffering from the
most frightful headaches her eyes
have been tested and found ex-
cellent so that this could not be the
cause  

 what does mrs barringer say
about her headaches the doctor
probed

 she says they are due to-but
what she says is so fanciful that it
wouldnt help you any to know
nevertheless tell me what she
says is the cause please

  well then answered boyd his
eyes averted   she says that it is due
to the changing of the shape of her
head she says that her skull is
gradually growing rounder and flat-
ter-like a cats

  the doctor shook his head

  ive never heard nor seen before
so persistent a delusion he mused
but im afraid there is nothing we
can do power of mind over matter
you know she will probably continue
to suffer from these headaches until
we can cure her if i could only see
her

  but this boyd would not consent

to

  she becomes terribly angry if i
even mention you he confessed
she simply would not see you or
admit for one instant the chance that
her mind is not quite right
however he was soon forced to
accede and obey the doctors request
that he see his patient personally

  clara he asked anxiously one
day why do you walk so queerly
with your arms hung so you are
getting very round-shouldered

  her voice was more disturbing in
the hopeless calm of its answer than
any wild hysteria would have been
and her words sent him rushing once
again to the specialists office

  you know why boyd she said
just that and nothing more no
a witchs curse



attempt to explain or to answer his
words of protest

  you must come and see for your-
self doctor he pleaded later the
time has arrived when we must do
something drastic this must stop
describe to me the way she walks
please

   it is very hard to describe about
all i can say is that she walks almost
like-like an animal her arms hang
straight down before her and are
drawn close together as though they
were-were forelegs she bends far
over from the waist so that her hands
are nearly on a level with her knees
and her stride itself has changed so
that while she seems to rise and fall
as though on pads she is yet more
awkward  

    quite in order with the cat
delusion pronounced the doctor
ill como this evening as a personal
friend dont hint to her that im
calling in a professional capacity
the call was not productive after
talking with clara barringer and
sounding her as deeply as he dared
the specialist admitted that he was
rather undecided as to what to do
next and as it is the custom to do
in such cases ho advised consulting
another specialist

  writing a name and address on his
card lie handed it to boyd

 go and see this man he
suggested your wifes case has
passed beyond the confines of the
mind and into the purely physical a
physician should sec her at once and
this man is of the best he is partie-
ularly well informed concerning bone
ailments-and i think he will need
all his knowledge to diagnose the
trouble that has bent your wifes
shoulders and rounded them so
decidedly  

  so another great specialist called at
the barringer home and examined
clara with microscopic care this
time the identity was admitted
boyd did not attempt to pass the
doctor off as a friend specimen blood

was taken and the specialist left in a
noncommittal fog of silence to take
his problem to the laboratory and
pronounce sentence accordingly

  poor boyd said clara softly
its no use dear you might as
well save us both grief and wasted
time no doctor can help me-unless
he can go back two hundred years and
save old joan basfield from a witchs
death 

 clara for gods sake- at

the look in her eyes boyd slopped
helplessly

  the findings ol the second specialist
threw no scientific light on the sub-
ject of the malformation of claras
back and shoulders

  there is absolutely nothing wrong
with mrs barringer that i can lay
my finger on with definite knowl-
edge he said yet there is some-
thing decidedly wrong with the set
of her shoulders and the curve of her
spine  

  boyd eyed the doctor intently
sensing evasion

  you are quite sure your lab-
oratory tests revealed no unusual
circumstance he insisted

  the doctor stroked his bearded
chin

  there was one perplexing dis-
covery lie said uneasily how-
ever i can only think it was the fault
of the microscope i have sent the
instrument out to bo inspected for
lens flaws and have submitted the
slide i was studying o a professional
laboratory for their opinion but of
course the error must lie in my micro-
scopo there could actually be no
such blood corpuscles as the glass
revealed  

  what was the matter boyds
voice was strained

  there were present in the blood
specimen i obtained some corpuscles
that were-t hardly know how to say
it-

  not human boyd suggested
biting his lips for self-control


weird tales

  yes said the doctor staring
exactly

  like a cats boyds voice was
unrecognizable

  how in the world did you guess
that man cried the doctor

  boyd told haltingly of the delusions
from which clara suffered

    but she is mad   said the doctor
utterly mad she needs more than
a physician my friend forgive me
for saying it but she should be given
the expert care of an institution for
the mentally deranged

   y our microscopic findings   

boyd said dully they prove-

  	 they prove no such crack-brained
thing as you suggest interrupted
the doctor   in these days of highly
artificial civilization humanity is
rapidly succumbing to new diseases
assuming my microscope is correct i
have merely been fortunate enough
from my standpoint at least to be in
a position to tabulate and announce a
new medical discovery that is all

 but it was not quite all the
worthy doctor was offered another
profound scientific puzzle before a
week had passed

  a fine downy growth of hair was
appearing  clara barringers arms
and body

 with detached excitement the
doctor took several specimens and
hastened to his microscope which had
been returned to him marked
mechanically perfect he examined
the specimen intently then he
phoned boyd and asked him to come
to his office at once

  it is like no hair that i have ever
seen before lie concluded it is
not like hair at all it is like-f ur
boyd was utterly beyond words
he merely nodded with his eyes
closed and his lips compressed still
without a word he left the doctors
office and went directly to the rail-
road station   

doyds interview with his aunt a
hundred miles away was not
very satisfactory

  boyd you are entirely insane
claras family history is correct
there was a joan basfield who was
hanged for witchcraft in salem in the
year  i will go further and
admit that i am a direct descendant
of that unfortunate woman-her son
changed the name to bassfield with
a double s for reasons that are now
unknown but as for the prepos-
terous bewitchment you are talking

of-

  so you are of the blood of joan
basfield the witch boyd flung at
her and this is the seventh genera-
tion  the seventh generation  
then he leaned back ashamed of his
violence

  you poor boy murmured jane
bassfield without reproach go back
to clara she needs you and give
her my sincerest love and sympathy  
on the train that bore him back
boyd tried not to think of the shadow
of a cold unearthly smile that had
seemed to tighten the comers of the
old womans lips he had of course
imagined this he was imagining
many things of late   

  at the door of his home he hes-
itated before admitting himself he
was imagining things again it
seemed to him as though a palpable
aura of loathsome shadows hung over
that house of his but he was not
left to stand long mary-the maid
wrho had replaced agnes-flung open
the door and beckoned him in before
he could insert his key in the lock
she had it appeared waited there for
him and her relief at his return wras
almost hysterical

  oh mr barringer mr barringer
somethings the matter with your
missus somethings the matter-

something-

  boyd shook the girl roughly as her
voice rose from key to key in over-
strung distress his hands clutching
a witchs curse



at her arms more savagely than he
knew jerked her back to some control
of herself

 what is wrong he urged
tell me

  i dont know what it is some-
thing shes in her room and wont
let anyone come in shes locked the
door  

    why did she lock herself in   
boyd was wrhite-faced with a fore-
boding he would not admit even to
himself was she ill

  no not exactly i cant say she
was sick hardly worse than that
mary wrept noisily fearfully

  what was the matter then tell
me how she looked

  she looked awful mr barringer
i can hardly tell you but less than
an hour after you left she began to
changc the hair on her arms and
body that you went to see the doctor
about got longer and thicker like it
was growing under your very eyes
and she got-smaller

  smaller what are you talking
about mary

 thats just what repeated
mary her voice rising shrilly again
she sort of shriveled up she sat
down in the big chair in the library
and she fell asleep i looked in at
her when she was just dozing off and
again when she just woke up and i
saw all the change in her and i say
she was littler she was a foot
shorter when she got up than when
she had sat down   

 mary-think what youre say-
ing boyd shook her again you
dont mean to say such a thing
you were mistaken

 no i wasnt either she was
really smaller her clothes hung
loose all over her and she was
stooped more than i ever saw her be-
fore   

 then what prompted boyd
licking his dry lips

    thens when she went to her
room all of a sudden she woke up
i was watching her and she gave
w t-

one look at herself in the big mirror
in the nail she screamed out like
someone had stabbed her and before

i	could say a word she turned and
scuttled up the stairs she didnt
run mr barringer--she scuttled
as she went her hands hung so low
that they touched the stairs and she
seemed to help herself along with
them too like an animal and her

 boyd waited to hear no more
releasing the girl from his clutch so
suddenly that she nearly fell he
turned and raced up the stairway to
claras room he did not stop to
turn on the lights but ran down the
dark hall with the certainty of long
familiarity

  clara he called tapping on the
panels of her door no light showed
from the slit under the door her
room was in pitch darkness and
there was no answer to his call

 clara-its boyd open the
door still there was no answer no
sound from the darkened room he
twisted at the knob but the door was
locked

 clara can you hear me he
pounded on the panels till the skin
was knocked from his knuckles
though he did not feel the pain

  i will have to break the door
down he said speaking aloud and
entirely unaware that he had so
spoken

  there was a stir in the darkened
room a voice that he could hardly
recognize as claras

  go away oh please go away

  i must get in clara

 no no go away the voice
wras high and keen almost metallic
it sounded more like a violin string
that had been plucked too harshly
than like a human voice

 but darling soothed boyd
dont you see-if youre not well
ill have to call the doctor you
cant stay on in there by yourself
you must have some kind of atten-
tion


weird tales

  boyd no

  wont you let me send mary in
to you if vou dont want me

 no

  clara dear-please

  no boyd no oil go away

  boyd called upon his will for a last
effort

  ill break in if you dont unlock
the door

 boyd you mustnt-

with his shoulder aching and
tingling from the shock boyd
stepped through the splintered door-
way and into the darkness of the
room the shades were tightly drawn
and this in addition to the natural
gloom of a moonless night made the
room like a pocket he tried to
penetrate the blackness with his eyes
but could see nothing

  his hand groped along the wall for
the light switch the movement was
arrested by the voice-the voice that
was like and yet not like claras it
the sound of that voice his searching
fingers seemed to coil in  them-
selves its though they had louehed ice

  dont light the light oh dont
light the light whatever you do you
mustnt touch ihe light

  boyd held his breath till his chest
ached the voice had come from low
down-from almrtst the level of the
floor

  what sight would meet his eyes if
he flooded that room with light
what machination of joan basfield
dead two hundred and thirty years
would reveal itself better never to
enter this room again better never to
look on his wifes face again than
stun his brain with the spectacle that
intuition told him would confront
his eyes

 but this was nonsense such

  things could not be he would light
the light so that he could go to clara
and soothe her out of her fears then
-after she was well again-they
would smile together at their fantastic
terrors his fingers sought along the
wall for the switch

   don   i on    t he voice
pleaded

  out of the whirlpool of his mind
boyd clutched at one perplexing
straw it was a small thing it
seemed to take up his thoughts at
such a moment but the wonder of it
grew and grew

 how-how do you know what i
am doing he whispered at last it
is too dark for you to see me i cant
see you

   i see every move you make said
the voice i can see as well in this
room as you can in daylight

  but how it is pitch-dark in
here how can you see

  oh boyd moaned the voice
you know why i can see in the
dark as well as in the light you
know  

  i wont believe it said boyd
hoarsely i tell you i wont believe
it t wont  wont

  again his questing fingers fumbled
for the light switch im going to
turn on this light 

  you mustnt  say you must

mt-

  there was a dick and the room was
flooded with light

  for a dozen eternities boyd stood
there in the doorway staring with
frightful eyes at a small furry body
that shuddered and huddled in the
corner

  there was a soft patter of frantic
paws the supple feline body flashed
by him and out of the door with a
scream that was almost human

by louise van de verg

t never saw such a thick fog
said the man where do you
jl suppose we are by this time
i dont know returned the wo-
man frank im afraid

  what nonsense margaret the
driver set us in the right path  
did he

  of course he did said the man
testily dont let yourself get nerv-
ous dont you suppose that driver
knows his business hes been meet-
ing the ships from-from-the ships
down there at the docks for twenty
years he told me so

  i heard that margarets little
gloved hand moved a trifle franti-
cally frank you dont remember
either thats-thats whats un-
nerved me-not the fog i cant re-
member where it is weve come from
-nor where were going tears
were near the surface of her voice
  frank-do you remember   

of course i do weve come

from- there was a long blank

pause through which the white fog
dripped from invisible trees and fell
with little pattering sounds to the un-
seen ground they could see nothing
but a short stretch of beaten path
with a little green at the edges al-
ways the same receding into the fog
at their backs appearing from the
fog in front of them they con-
tinued to walk but there was panic
between them as they paced through
the looming and invisible wood

  at last the man spoke i dont
remember he said under his breath
i-dont-remember the silence
fell again heavily oppressive as the
fog

  they came to the gate before they
knew it was there and paused before
it doubtfully

  shall we go through asked the
woman

  the path does and the driver

said-

  ah dont speak to me of the
driver but she opened the gate
and they went through together the
sound of the dripping trees grew faint
behind them and there avere floavers
beside the path noav  i hope edith
has not been worrying about us said
margaret

  edith  cried the man  edith

then you do-

  it came to me all at once she
said wondering until you spoke
i didnt realize i hadnt ini own be-
fore

  edith what

  i-dont remember her married
name shes a widow and avere-

ave re- 

  as she spoke they came to a house
-a small comfortable cottage by
what they could see of it were
what    asked the man

  i dont remember that she an-
savered the anxious frown on her
broav again it must be that we
have been invited to call-if we avere
to stay longer wed have had our oavii
bags i-almost feel i know this
house frank i suppose its because
edith has sent me pictures but i

sponse to his oarerture its charm-
ing but it-frightens me

weird tales

  itll come back to you he re-
assured her its begun already
isnt there anyone home dyou
think   

  i dont know margaret sighed
you might ring she suggested

  a moment later edith was at the
door how do you do she said
interrogatively it was plain she did
not know them margaret felt a shock
of surprize but was able to answer

 i am margaret chiltern she
said there she had made the mis-
take she had feared to make mar-
garet chiltern indeed margaret
dawes since this morning she
glanced at her husband there was
no expression in his face

  come in mrs chiltern edith
was opening the door and mr
chiltern im glad to see you i was
almost afraid youd bo lost in this
fost 

   o

  well well it wras a natural mistake
 her part why didnt frank cor-
rcet her she was a hospitable soul
thought margaret but typical of the
women whom matrimony deadens
whose husbands leave them for other
women by the time they reach the for-
ties perhaps she had been spared
a heavier heartache by her husbands
early death these thoughts were in
the top of margarets mind as she fol-
lowed her hostess down the passage
beneath them surged horror horror
of what she would not look at it
long enough to find out she was only
able to cast oblique glances and see
the matronly figure of edith moving
kindly in its midst

  this is your room said edith
opening a door

  why our trunks are here cried
margaret

  yes said the woman with a sur-
prized look whats the matter
mrs chiltern

  nothing-nothing said marga-
ret you have-unusually quick
service here

  yes its good assented edith
youll want to freshen up after

your journey i suppose ill see to
tea unless theres something else i
can do for you

  thank you we shant need a
thing   said margaret

  i dont usually have tea when
im alone edith said and its
such a pleasure to me that you like it
i always had it when ronny was
home she smiled and left them

 now is ronny her husband
wondered margaret

 dont meg frank almost
moaned the words lets get away
from here i dont like it margaret
theres-theres something about that
woman  

  why frank

  i didnt dare correct her about
the names he went on theres
something about that woman he re-
iterated   im-yes i am im
afraid of her  

  youre getting as bad as i am
smiled margaret but without mirth
shes a dear thing

  yes but margaret i know her i
tell you i know her only i-
cant remember did-did you see
that scar on her throat 

  i saw it she answered steadily
but she was unable to hide a small
shudder that possessed her at the mo-
ment of speech this rooms-fa-
miliar somehow too she said after
a minute i know ive been in this
room before  

    how could you have been   

    i dont know maybe its because
its-its like the rooms the womens
magazines tell you how to furnish i
dont suppose i really have been in
it she added gazing idly into the
fog shed remember me if i had
been i think the fogs not so thick
 lets go back now margaret be-
fore she comes again wthile the fog
will hide us

 back where oh frank i
couldnt go back to those woods again
not knowing where we were going or
what would happen

  you dont know whats going to
the three



happen here it may he something
horrible i feel it margaret i feel
something horrible in the air please
come away darling-

  its the fog she assured him
ediths knock prevented a repeti-
tion of his plea they went out to sit
at a pleasant tea-table and smile po-
litely comfortable smiles at their
mysterious hostess who placidly
poured and served and chatted in a
halo of terror

 ronny-my boy you know-is in
south america-with a steamship
company hes a dear boy and a
very capable officer hes doing aw-
fully well

  im glad of that said margaret
 do you hear from him often

  a distressed look crossed ediths
face i havent heard from him
since the earthquake she said but
really i dont suppose theres any
reason to worry that country you
know that earthquake was when i
lost my husband she told them

  it was hard for margaret to sit with
a polite face even a sympathetic lace
while icy fear swirled about her she
ventured a glance at frank he too
was tortured

  ediths voice continued to an ac-
companiment of margarets murmur
of sympathy we had been driving
you know and we were coming home
frank-my husbands name was
frank too like yours mrs ohiltern
-frank had been nervous all day and
the traffic had bothered him you
know t believe there is something in
the air before a quake at any rate
we both felt it-a kind of tension you
know we were glad to get home
i went in first and frank was right
behind me wc had one of ihose big
hat-racks with mirrors in the hall
and the first thing t noticed was that
it was moving the next minute i
knew nothing

  a hat-rack with a mirror-a dark
hall-a woman coming in out of the
night as though in a moving pic-
ture margaret saw herself in that

hall moving from that shadow with a
gleaming-what not a knife yet
in the picture it was a knife and mar-
garet seemed quite calm in a whirl
of horror she forced herself to listen

  the mirror was broken and a
piece of the glass cut me here edith
touched the scar  her throat i
had a bad concussion and was un-
conscious for several weeks t never
even knew when mr dawes funeral
took place-i have never known the
date she rose we need some
more jelly she said placidly moving
to the kitchen

  this horror left her untouched yet
she was part of it the pictures were
whirling now before margarets eyes
she could no longer hide from them
the knife nor its use nor their flight
nor their capture-nor the plain bare
room from which they had started
 hat morning with the terrible throne
in its center-the throne of death

  frank she whispered frank
her husbands name was frank
i awes  

  we hail seen this house before it
was mine -where i lived-with-
her he was breathing heavily
she doesnt know us he whispered
she doesnt know us-and i guess
she never will

  well have to get away

  we cant we were brought
well have to stay

  but were lead frank were
dead and i thought after we were
dead wed-wed be together

  she was dead first and we are
together--wilh her

  weve jof to get away frank
we cant i know we cant
there was a dreary and desolate final-
ity in the insistent repetition

  even-here-it follows us she
mused and she did not again think
of flight

  edith was in the room again ive
been very much alone since then
she said that was why i adver-
tised for a couple or two ladies to


weird tales

live with me i do hope   she smiled
that you wont call me mrs dawes
mrs cliiltem lets not stand on
ceremony my name is edith you

margarets lips were stiff but she
smiled i will call you edith she

said ive felt from the first i knew
you well

  im glad and may i cad you
margaret she moved to the win-
dow the fog has lifted she said
we can see the woods plainly i
love those trees  

joan

ior centuries the myth that a
 woman once occupied the papal
chair at rome persisted and was
believed by many scholars the fa-
ble seems to have been first launched
in the thirteenth century although
she was said to have lived four hun-
dred years before most writers
placed her reign at about 
to  a d the story most
common was that she was of
english descent though one ac-
count has made her the daughter of
a thessalian but was bora at ingel-
heim or mainz in germany her
name at this time is sometimes given
as agnes at school she was clever
and studious in her youth she fell
in love with a young benedictine
monk and clad in male attire fled
with him to athens after his death
she removed to rome still disguised
as a man and rose rapidly in the
church being distinguished for high
integrity and great learning pres-
ently she was elected cardinal and
soon afterward pope most of the
accounts then represented her as hav-
ing died under very discreditable

circumstances during a religious
celebration

  so firmly established was the be-
lief in this story that as late as 
and  two ponderous works on
the subject were published by dutch
scholars the first by professor kist
to prove the existence of pope joan
and the second by professor
wensing to demolish kists argu-
ment aii italian investigator turned
out a volume in  upon the sub-
ject and dollinger of germany
about  devoted a consider-
able part of a volume to dis-
proving the yarn kist thought
that pope joan was possibly the
widow of pope leo iv who died
in  but history seems to show
pretty conclusively that benedict iii
succeeded leo iv and reigned from
 to  another writer claimed
that joan reigned for a short time
between leo and benedict

  there are some people still who
repeat the old gossip for truth but
the whole thing is so preposterous
and so utterly without foundation
that modern historians dismiss it as
a myth

the story thus far

ralph hearne riding in a new york subway
in the year  is recognized by dr trask
as the reincarnation of boris saranoff who nearly
a century before had helped bury the jewels of the
russian imperial family in the sea at bakelief
island alaska dr trask is himself the reincar-
nation of gregory birsk an unscrupulous russian
soldier of fortune who had tried to obtain the
jewels for himself and been slain in a duel and
dr trasks lovely wife is the reincarnation of the
grand duchess tatiana the murdered tsars
daughter who escaped the massacre of her family
by the bolsheviks at ekaterinburg dr trask
projects himself his wife hearne and merwiu
the doctors assistant who is the reincarnation
of metkanofi back into the past in the fourth
dimension hoping that by their combined psychic
power they can change the course of past events
and discover the hiding-place of the tsars jewels
he plans to betray his wife and hearne leaving
them stranded in the fourth dimension nearly a
century in the past while he returns to his body
in  a d and organizes an expedition to
bakelief island to recover the jewels for himself
the four arrive on the island and enter the bodies
of the russians saranoff fights a due with
birsk who fails to change the course of fate and
is lulled he has with him the ling containing the
little pellets that would enable hearne and mrs
trask to return to their own bodies they arc
stranded back in the past in the bodies of sara-
noff and tatiana

	stranded in the past

karlak recovered himself
first with a single bound he
 cleared a way through those
between himself and hillis a sudden
blow and he had felled the man hold-
ing the american

  he turned to the girl quick he
shouted over the cliffs

  she too seemed rooted to the spot
but marta pushed her toward the
edge a quick rush and the dazed
saranoff was beside her his hand still
gripping his useless arm an instant
later and they jumped almost
together landing on the shelving
ledge ten feet below karlak and
hillis waited only until they were
once more on their feet then be and
hillis jumped also

            

 this story began in weird tales for december


weird tales

  metkanoff was the first of birsks
henchmen to realize what had
happened running pistol in hand
to the edge of the cliff he knelt and
leaned over aiming carefully at the
scrambling group below they were
helpless to shield themselves but
even as his finger tightened on the
trigger he felt himself seized about
the waist and then locked in old
martas withered arms ho staggered
and tottered over the void until
balance left him and he fell dragging
her with him to the waiting pacific
below mcrwin still projected from
metkanoffs true body read his doom
in the falling man screamed once-
and vanished

  pandemonium reigned on he cliff
few had brought firearms and those
who had were in no mind to venture
too near the edge over which two of
their number had so quickly gone to
their deaths before they could
collect their scattered wits there came
a shout from one of them and then
looking down into the valley they
saw three figures running toward the
edge of the basin

  ralph hearne in saranoffs body
had viewed this swift course of events
with horrified dismay whatever
chance gloria trask might have had
of returning to her own world her
own body was nowirretrievably lost
so far as he could see birsk had been
killed leaving trasks soul to iho
horrible fate of wandering through
eternity there now remained only
the ring which would be on birsks
finger since metkanoff after taking it
from saranoff had given it to birsk
the day they were captured but
birsks body was in the pacific quite
out of reach and even if birsks
body lay within saranoffs reach
hearne could not touch the ring
because one of the innumerable
dimensions of space lay between him
and it and with trask gone and
merwin gone and their psychic power
destroyed there would not be enough

psychic power left between hearne
and gloria trask to enable hearne to
suspend the laws of space and reach
through the dimension which lay be-
tween him and the ring and take it
xo her soul was to be lost as well as
his saranoff and the grand duchess
were rushing on now to their doom
a few hours would see them die it
had been so ordained

  hearne took some cold comfort in
the fact that no act of his had
contributed to the loss of gloria
trasks soul and thinking thus lie
allowed himself once more the max-
imum of relaxation in saranoffs
body realizing that the latter had
now emerged in the valley and was
running with karlak the grand
duchess and itillis toward the basin

  the launch of the narcissus was
moored to the rough stone quay near
the shore it required but a few
moments for the fugitives to scramble
into it and push off to the yacht as
they swarmed up the companionway
ladder there were tiny geysers rising
in the water below them and distant
reports from the cliffs told them a
few of those they had left behind had
resorted to their rifles

  hillis tore the tarpaulin from
the machine-gun where birsk had
mounted it on the forecastle and in
another moment the harsh rattle of it
sent the russians on the cliffs scurry-
ing to shelter then a deep silence
descended on the island

  it was a queer thing that pain
coming in my shoulder just when it
did saranoff was saying to the
grand duchess it felt just like a
searing red-hot iron i thought some-
one had shot me

  isnt there a wound there she
asked

  he turned back his coat and opened
his shirt not a thing he mur-
mured

  and i thought i heald a pistol

shot she added
the isle of lost souls



wonder what those devils are up
to fumed karlak when an
hours close watch on the hills above
the basin had failed to show them
sign of any living thing theyre
planning some deviltry but  cant
imagine what it may be 

  the silence was indeed ominous

  	 i dont know what they could
possibly do began karlak once
more theres nothing-st mi-
chael   

  came a whistling shriek overhead
and then a great geyser of water shot
skyward near the farther side of the
basin many yards away from the
yacht on the heels of it there was a
re-echoing crash from the cliffs which
sent the nesting sea-gulls into the
air with wild flapping of pinions and
raucous cries karlaks face went
white

    by heaven  he cried   i for-
got the gun we unshipped it from
the vessel that brings us supplies
and now its up over the passage
they could sink us in a few
minutes  

  another whistle and shriek and a
second shot plunged into the basin
this time no nearer the vessel than
before

  they cant hit us from where the
gun is now said karlak theres
an intervening ledge of rock between
us and them and they have to shoot
too high to clear it but it wont take
more than a few minutes to move the
gun

  iiis surmise was correct a third
shot from the cliff had apparently
convinced them that they were but
wasting their ammunition

  half an hour later those on the
narcissus saw a group of figures
tugging with ropes on one of the
upper cliffs and not long afterward
they saw the black muzzle of the
piece swing into place behind a bar-
rier of stones hillis tried to reach
them with the machine-gun but they
were safely out of range

  presently a shell shrieked over the
basin and dropped close o the bows
of the narcissus scarcely had the
ripples on the water died away than
another whined through the air
crashing into the forecastle and ex-
ploding just under hillis and the
machine-gun

  saranoff started forward but ivar-
jak held him back pointing with
trembling finger at the limp figure of
hillis lying in the torn and twisted
debris about the gun almost at the
same moment the forward part of the
narcissus burst into flame and soon
a dense pall of smoke rolled upward
shutting the cliffs from ihcir vi-w

  i think wed better abandon ship
under cover of that smoke said
karlak we can swim to th shore
and hide in one of those caves but
id better got some food to carry with
us wait here

  he ran down the companiouway
stairs to the saloon hearnc parted
to follow but at that instant another
shell shrieked out of the smoke tear-
ing and crashing its way through o
the saloon deck there came a second
rending crash from below as it ex-
ploded followed by a burst of white-
hot flame from the ignited woodwork

  saranoff dropped down the
companionway and gazed into the
blazing cabin karlak lay there full
on the floor amidst a duller of broken
crockery and torn hangings

  karlak karlak cried sara-
noff running to the prostrate man
karlak arc you badh hit 

  dont bother-with me-get out
-away from here-while you can
theyll be sure to board you when
they sec it burning o

  his head slumped downward his
voice trailed off into silence sara-
noff fearing his coat away pul his
ear to karlnks heart ft was still

  as he emerged from the compan-
ionway another shell shrieked over

weird tales

their heads this time plunging into
the basin he hurried to the girl
weve got to get over the side and
swim for it he exclaimed can
you swim

  yes

  suiting action to the word they
dropped over the side and into the
water by this time the narcissus
was beginning to list heavily toward
them while smoke poured over her
forward and aft the firing from the
cliffs had ceased for that moment at
least the time to go was now under
the shelter of the black pall which
rolled heavenward from the doomed
vessel

  swimming slowly with only their
heads near the surface for a neces-
sary draft of air they struck out
toward the promontory under which
the cavern led through to the pacific
scarcely had they reached the ledge
beneath it than there came a shout
from the cliffs behind them followed
by a report a rifle bullet smacked
against the stones above their heads
sending down a clutter of stones and
gravel churning the water with
powerful strokes saranoff pushed the
girl ahead of him into the cavern
the tide was coming in and the open-
ing was already nearly covered with
water but knowing the path as they
uid they were able to push in until
the air and darkness of the inner
tunnel greeted them once more

  saranoff knew they must hurry if
they were to reach the other side be-
fore the tide filled the farther end of
the cavern but to be caught between
the two would not be fatal since they
could linger in the upper reaches
until it ebbed again he doubted
whether they would be pursued far at
this time later they might easily be
trapped on the other side if the
islanders guessed their purpose

  at that moment there was a
splashing in the tunnel behind them
followed by the murmur of voices
they were being pursued after all

  itc pushed ahead in the blackness

knowing that the slim chance of
safety now depended on their getting
to the other side and swimming or
wading to a place of concealment
somewhere at the base of the cliffs
on they toiled now crawling now on
all fours now standing upright and
running as fast as they dared fear-
ing at any moment to plunge head-
long into some projecting ledge be-
hind them the voices died away into
silence presently the girl who was
ahead halted suddenly and saranoff
plunged headlong into her

  whats the matter he asked
boris she murmured theres
a wall here its caved in

  he groped with his hands no
thats solid we must have run off
in some side tunnel weve missed
the way if we hurry we may get
back to the dividing-point before they
reach it

  they plunged back in the gloom
presently they rounded a sharp cor-
ner and emerged into the vaulted
passage once more

    this is where we got off the
track muttered saranoff quick
follow ahead on the other branch
at that moment there was a shout
from behind them and a beam of
light shot through the gloom from the
distant end of the tunnel it was an
electric torch in the hands of the
islanders the fugitives turning to
run toward the pacific side found
themselves plunged to the knees in
icy water it was the tide from the
pacific

  were caughtsaranoff groaned
  theyve-my god  

  from somewhere in the murk be-
hind them there came a low rumble
followed by a shout of terror and
then a terrific roar that filled the
cavern the light behind them van-
ished there were smothered screams
another grating roar and then silence
save for the subdued rippling of the
water at their feet

  staggering back saranoff found
himself confronted by an earthy
the isle of lost souls



wall pierced here and there by the
comers of giant rocks the vaulted
roof of the cave had fallen in even as
hillis had predicted the pursuers
were caught crushed and smothered
under tons and tons of basalt not a
cry not a groan from the immovable
pile

  they were saved saranoff the
word hoarse on his lips staggered
backward-to find himself standing
once more deep in the water saved
-but for what to be drowned here
with the incoming tide from the
pacific escape was impossible they
could never swim that distance under
water to the mouth of the cavern
the tide would run much farther in
than its present mark they were
surely trapped

 the face in the water

he toij her in as few words as pos-
sible what had happened she
said nothing-only came and stood
closer to him in the darkness while
the ripples played about their ankles
finally he put his arm about her and
they groped their way over to the
wall

  theres a flat-topped stone here
lets sit down and wait he said
quietly

  the tide crept on up to their shoe-
tops

  so this is to be the end lie
murmured after all it wont be so
bad-we shall die together

  yes she answered her voice in
a whisper it has been a long time
that we have waited but now that

we are together- lie felt her

stiffen suddenly and pull partly away
from him

  do you realize she asked her
voice struck with awe that this is
not a rock were sitting on its-
its an iron chest see i can feel a
handle at this end

  by heaven youre right lie
murmured its the second chest
karlak said that avas only a ruse-
to sink one in the harbor-probably

the officers did it to fool the creav
when they brought them in then
they hid this other in here it must
contain the jewels but small good
theyll do anybody now

  she pushed herself again into his
arms saying nothing

  the water lapped gently about
tlieir knees he put out his hand to
measure its depth on the avails and
pulled suddenly back avith an ex-
clamation of horror she asked him
what it avas

  its a face-theres a body float-
ing there brought in by the tide he
murmured lie rewched again into
the water yes its a body-
birsks body remember he fell off
the cliff about near the opening of
this cavern

  must he be with us even here
she asked shuddering

  ralph hearne in saranoffs body
had until now vieaved the further
course of events avith apatliv lie had
so completely given up his own soul
for lost that its destiny interested
bin no further with birsks death
he had realized that the ring was
noav out of gloria trasks reach as
avell as his oato and that she was now
doomed to the same fate as he

  birsks body had drifted by chance
into the cavern avhere they avere
trapped but even in this close prox-
imity to the ring he and gloria trask
were separated from it by the
luidgeless cavern of some unknown
dimension tie might reach down
and try to wrench it from the corpse
but he knoav that so far as birsks
corpse avas concerned his fingers
could have no more effect upon it
than the tiny ripples which uoav
played over it

  thinking thus lie projected him-
self out of saranoffs body and
called for gloria trask and in that
instant she avas there at his side

  we are lost he said quietly and
without emotion we lack suffi-
cient psychic power to reach through
the dimension and take the ring


weird tales

for myself i am reconciled since
for a long time i could see no other
end but for you- had hoped for
more if birsk had lived trask
would have survived lie told me it
was his intention to take you back
with him to our own world  

 she shuddered that would be
far worse than death-far worse
than what is in store for us she
murmured looking up at him i
would rather be hero with you
you do not understand he pro-
tested this is horrible it is not
a pleasant fate to contemplate the
loss of ones immortal soul

  well shall we not lose it to-
gether shall we not always be to-
gether   

  he looked at her scarcely daring
to believe his ears

  gloria he said i love you i
love you

 yes and i love you i know
now has it not been paid that love
alone is immortal v how can our
souls die if still we love or is that
just some pretty thing a poet has
said

  i fear it is poetry said he
and poetry and science seldom
mix but it is a thought i will ask
the spirit karlak

  the spirit kaflak stood beside
them in that instant i was
afraid said he that you would
not call me before it is too late
saranoff and the grand duchess will
die by drowning within the hour
quite as was arranged by fate
traslc failed in his attempt thank
god he little realized what a prob-
lem he had on his hands he used
the pooled psychic power to swing
events out of alinement he succeed-
ed but they snapped back into place
again he should have been better
prepared  

how was that asked hearne
well fate has it that saranoff
should kill birsk on the rock trask
prevented birsk being killed by
saranoff through using merwin as

it was ordained saranoff was to cut
birsk down and then his dead body
was to fall over the cliff as it hap-
pened saranoff did not cut birsk
down but he fell over the cliff
nevertheless the ultimate effect
was the same the only difference
was that birsks life was prolonged
some fifty seconds he died on the
reefs rather than by a saber-thrust
on the cliff everything else has
been exactly as it was ordained
nothing else has varied one jot
hillis and karlak were to be killed
on the yacht their bodies are now
on the bottom with her karlaks
individual soid had been reabsorbed
in me the rest were to be killed by
the landslide in the cavern you
have just witnessed that saranoff
and the grand duchess perish in the
cavern with the tide see the water
is already to their waists  

  and we lose our souls when they
perish put in hearne dully

  on the contrary said the spirit
karlak you do nothing of the sort
the ring is here now is it not
birsks body is there floating in the
cavern  

  yes but i can not touch the ring
i am in another dimension from
birsks body am i not

  true but there is enough psychic
power here in this cavern to suspend
the laws of the universe for the mo-
ment you may reach through and
take it-i can assure you of that

  then it is our love is it not
asked gloria trask i was just
telling ralph that love was im-
mortal  therefore we who loved
could never die but he thought
that was merely a saying of the
poets

  the spirit karlak smiled it is
your earthly way of explaining
psychic phenomena   said he  it is
merely calling the same thing by a
different name the fact of the mat-
ter is that love is one of the greatest
dynamos of psychic force in the
world it is the bridge between the
the isle of lost souls



psychic and the purely physical
hence it partakes of the properties
of both love has come to you at
this moment in this cavern go my
friends reach down and take the
ring it is yours and since you are
through with me i shall bid you
farewell  

  farewell said hearne raising
his hand

  but the spirit karlak had van-
ished

 hearne waded forward into the
cavern it was a gruesome job to
push his hands over that ghastly
floating object but in a moment the
ring was in his hand he came back
unscrewed the cap and gave her one
of the pellets the remaining one he
took himself

  look she said pointing to the
couple sitting on the chest look
saranoff has taken the princess in
his arms let us relax and go back
into their bodies they will die in
each others arms but you and t
will live

  they relaxed and lie found her in
his arms

  i feel drowsy she murmured
there seems to be a warm glow
stealing over me and a roaring as of
winds in a cavern

  it is the sea he said it is
almost to their shoulders i am
drowsy too very drowsy

  and so locked in each others
arms they fell off into deep slumber

  the tide rolled in leached their
shoulders rose to their mouths and
played with her hair presently they
drifted from the chest and floated
there on the surface still locked in
each others arms

epilogue

on a certain day in may in the
year  the new york city
newspapers carried an account of the
tragic outcome of a series of experi-
ments by dr gregory trask the

noted psychiatrist in his laboratory
on east twenty-eightli street late
in the evening of that day the police
were called to the trask apartment
by mrs trask and ralph hearne a
young man who had recently been
hired by dr trask as a laboratory
assistant there they found that dr
trask and his first assistant olan
merwin had succumbed to an over-
dose of a morphine compound with
which dr trask had been experi-
menting on his own body and on
that of merwin a curious angle of
the case was however that although
the phial found at dr trasks side
contained a compound showing traces
of morphine the usual effects of
morphine poisoning or any other
poisoning could not be found in the
viscera of the victim when an autopsy
was performed on the bodies indeed
so far as the medical examiner could
determine there was no condition
apparent in the bodies whieh could
have brought about such an unex-
pected and untimely end

  shortly afterward when the ease
had been quite forgotten hearne
married mrs trask and the two
with the small funds left by dr
trask journeyed to alaska on their
honeymoon there they chartered a
small motor-cruiser for a summer
trip in the aleutian archipelago ac-
cording to john torrence who navi-
gated the small vessel for them the
trip was uneventful save for one in-
cident near bakelief island mr
and mrs hearne evinced a sudden
desire to explore one of the several
caverns which honeycomb the granite
cliffs of the island good luck seemed
to be with them for deep inside the
cavern they found a solid iron chest
which they brought back to the cruis-
er but never opened during all the
time they were on board near the
chest according to mr torrence they
discovered half buried in the sands
three skeletons one of these ob-
viously that of a man of great size
lay at a considerable distance from


weird tales

the other two of these two tor-
rence who examined them closely
thinks one was a woman and the other
a man

  some of the old residents remem-
bered the incident of the narcissus
then and ventured the theory that the
vaeht in trying to escape the destroy-
ers had struck a hidden reef of bake-
lief going down immediately with all
hands these were survivors who had
crawled to the cavern and hidden
there only to be trapped by the tide
but those who examined the old rec-
ords said this could hardly be so
since there had been no woman on
board the narcissus after she was
stolen

  nobody ever knew what was in the
iron chest but it must have been

treasure because shortly after their
return mr and mrs hearne seemed
to have come into great wealth of
this they spent little on themselves
preferring rather to make bounteous
grants to charity with a peculiar lean-
ing toward the efforts of the ameri-
can relief association in its work
with the orphans of russia

  as for bakelief-it is a place avoid-
ed now since that day the phantom
ship was seen followed so soon by the
finding of the skeletons no mariner in
his right mind would be found within
rifle-shot of its beetling fog-swept
crags and those that pass there at
whatever distance report they hear on
the rising tide the beat of waves in the
cavern and a moaning of receding
waters like the wailing of lost souls

                      	doom

                 oblivion had laid its deathless curse

   upon all things of life and time and space

                 of death itself there now was left no trace
                 and doom had fallen on the universe

                 the heavens like a dead colossal hearse

                contained no thought or dust of thing or race
                in all infinity was left no place
                where death in death all things did not immerse

   for death the conqueror at last was king

   his realms were vacua he proved his vow

                    that all would pass that nothing would abide
                 not anywhere was life nor anything

                nor vestige of the worlds of old and now

                   upon his fallen kingdoms god had died

melodie in e
minor

  by august w derleth

there is a certain section of
st louis that gives one nausea
to go through there is a per-
petual cloud of smoke above the sec-
tion a cloud which no one seems to
mind not even the people who walk
about below it with soot-streaked
faces once in a while on a clear
night the smoke disappears only to
appear in a much denser form the
following morning a heavy rain
drives the smoke away for a while
but it is sure to come back when the
rain stops a stench that seems alive
creeps from one dim alley to another
gathering strength as it goes this
too the people do not mind dirty
children play in the midst of it they
go home recking with it but what
difference docs it make their homes
reek with it

  there are more than two hundred
houses in this section and each house
is just like all the others tims each
house might have belonged to jack
hammond except for one little dif-
ference in hammonds house the
noise started exactly at  oclock in
the evening and ended exactly at 
oclock in the morning when both
jack and amy went to work

  when amy married jack ham-
mond he had prospects but some-
how he lost them and amy never for-
gave him for it when they moved to
this squalid section it was to be tem-
porary but it had become perma-
nent amy would not forgive jack
either for this or for making her go to
work shortly after their marriage

  amy made life miserable for jack
in all ways but especially at the sup-
per table she had taken a fancy to
a piece by rachmaninoff that she had
once hoard in a recital melodic in e
minor she bought the piece and
learned it note for note until she was
able to play it after a fashion every
night wldle jack ate his supper she
played it at first jack didnt want
to say anything about it though he
hated that kind of music and amy
knew it invariably he began to hum
st louis blurs when amy started to
play but amy soon drowned him out
cursing did amy no harm nor did
his threats the situation showed no
sign of progressing either for better
or for worse

  at  oclock in the evening the pro-
gram opened somewhat like this
supper ready from jack to
amys young brother who stayed at
home and did the cooking for the two
workers

  amy would throw down her bag
and hat and move toward the door of
the parlor it was called a parlor
only because of the piano in it im
not hungry guess ill play the piano
for a while

  at this juncture amys brother va-
cated

  listen amy this from jack 
if you think youre going to play that
thing again you got another guess
coming and if you play that e

minor thing ill-

  shut up jack whvd i ever


weird tales

ciation of good music and never will
have havent even got a little horse
sense

  shut up damn you i got just
as good an education as you amy
hammond amy if you play that

eye tomorrow

 oh yeh  yeh of course  

one night amys brother jim set
the supper table as usual and
went out for a package of cigarettes
when he came back he found jack
home surly as always with an expres-
sion on his face that scared amys
brother

  wheres amy jack

  she aint home yet jim aint
seen her on the way have you   
no

  where in thunder is she then
she ought to be home by now  

   yeh she ought to 

  jack sat down and began to eat his

supper from time to time he
glanced nervously at the door

  what in hells keeping that wo-
man sure she isnt home

  	 she didnt come in  

  jack kept on eating suddenly the
staccato notes of rachmaninoffs
melodic in e minor came to the ears
of the two men in the kitchen jack
dropped his fork with a curse and
looked at amys brother cowed the
youth shrank into a corner but curi-
ously jacks glance was not of anger
and amys brother picked up courage

   its amy jack shes come in by
the winder

  my god do you hear the piano
jim

  sure its amy

  jack got up from the table slowly
his hands hung limply by his side
his face twitched spasmodically

    dont hurt her jack dont hurt
her please

  jack hammond did not notice the
youth in the comer for a second he
stood before the parlor door then
he turned to amys brother

  call amy jim

  	 amy amy   the youth stuck
his head into the parlor   she dont
answer jack i cant see very well
its kinda dark in there he turned
and looked at jack curiously
maybe it aint amy huh jack

  with a stifled sound jack ham-
mond sank back into a chair no
no my god it aint amy it
cant be amy no it aint 

  he rose a second time and moved
jerkily toward the parlor door the
piece ended abruptly then began over
again

  something like a sob escaped jack
my god i killed amy just befoie
-she started playing again-that
damned piece it aint amy i killed
her  

  without a sound he pitched for-
ward and lay in a crumpled heap on
the floor

its all right on the heart go ahead
 suppose you fellows know all those
things well enough or you wouldnt
be planning to use it on me

  we know those things he was
assured weve used this gas in this
hospital it is highly desirable to use

                                   


weiri tales

it because of the very things you
mention shock is slight heart action
good the physical condition fine
but-

  heres the dope brown inter-
rupted the house doctor we gave
ethysene to a man named hallam
who had a tonsillectomy here all
right he took it well and rallied well
only when he had regained con-
sciousness he insisted that the new
gas had an effect on the soul and
that it had sent his to heaven he
liked it so well in heaven that after
he got out and about he took gas
again-illuminating-gas in his room
with the keyhole plugged and that
sort of thing you know-in order to
go back to heaven again i guess he
succeeded-at least he died  

  brown laughed

  well im pretty well satisfied
lhat my family tree goes back to a
line hairy ape i guess that answers
your question unless of course the
gas had the effect of making him loco
do you mean hes the only patient
hero who ever took ethysene and that
i would be the second   

  oh no no the surgeon and
house doctor answered together and
the house doctor continued

  	 three cases-names were newton
meredith and csfnby-weve been
offering it pretty freely though most
of our patients want the old-fashioned
stuff newton meredith and canby
they all three had ethysene inside the
last month well none of them went
to heaven so now what do you
ay

  oh make it ethysene by all
means said brown i say lets
et it over lets go

  browu had had a reason for asking
to be taken to franklin hospital
his sweetheart dorothy wood a
pretty girl with gray eyes and dark
auburn hair was a student nurse
there while brown was being pre-
pared for the operating-room a
coarse hospital gown buttoned at his
neck coarse white wrappings fastened

over his feet and legs and a hy-
podermic needle jabbed into his arm
the girl hovered in the corridor out-
side his door when they wheeled
him into the hall his brain hazy
from the injected opiate she met his
gaze with a tender tremulous smile
it raised browns spirits and the
effect of the morphine was to make
him light-headed

  tell you all about heaven when
 get baek dorothy he called as
they wheeled him toward the elevator

 for a moment the girl named
dorothy stood motionless uncon-
scious of sympathetic glances from
two other nurses and a young intern
who stood near by all at once she
started forward

  did he mean-are they going to
give him that ethysene gas she
asked the young intern

  yes but thats all right dont
worry miss wood he consoled her
theie was only that fellow hallam
theyve used it since and its per-
fectly fine hallam was crazy

  but it might-it might affect the
soul  

  the intern raised his eyebrows

  well if brown goes to heaven
hell come back as poor hallam said
that he did and then  guess you
can keep him here cant vou miss
wood

  he chuckled and went off down the
corridor

brown lay fiat on his back his face
encased in an air-tight mask
there were isinglass cye-holes
through which he looked through a
tube in front of his mouth and nose
the anesthetic was being pumped in
ttis heart beat hard with the excite-
ment and fear that were overmaster-
ing him at last he wanted to kick
and struggle but lie would not let
himself do that he would breathe
deeply and got it over

  lots go-lots go lie muttered
inside the mask
ax adventure in anesthesia



  his lungs burned as lie inhaled
deeply little pains like knives shot
through them but his effort to co-
operate was having an effect his
heart did not pound now he felt
weak-yes faint he was going at
every pump stroke the white faces he
now saw dimly through the isinglass
dissolved into white mist between
strokes they became faces again but
each time more featureless more in-
distinct somebody spoke to him

  lift your hand can you lift
your hand

  they must not think he was un-
conscious he lifted his hand with
an effort

  now everything was a white mist

he was floating-

  again lift your hand

  brown made a supreme effort he
willed to lift liis whole arm-to lift
it high for he was not unconscious
but they would think so the world
was unreal about him-he could not
see he could hardly hear-but he
was intensely conscious and they
must not begin to cut he directed
the whole force of his will of his
consciousness into the lifting of his
arm--and somehow knew that he had
raised one linger just a little

  he was floating-going away up
in the upper right-hand corner of the
room he felt that he stopped some-
how he felt that he stopped there
although he was adrift in a mist
through which he could not see
anxiety held him there for a moment
a little way down there was the table
and what was going on there was of
vital importance yet he could not
hold himself near he was adrift
and going far and fast

  he was dizzy with rushing through
space-dizzy with not seeing with
not feeling anything to lav hold 
with having nothing to orient himself
by lie was desperate he clutched
with his hands

  and suddenly both hands were
caught in a firm grip the relief he
felt measured the horror that had

been engulfing him he felt his feet
on something solid and saw the mist
thinning around him only a little
for he could not see far in any direc-
tion but he could see now that he
stood not by one person but between
two men and each had one of his
hands

  he blinked his eyes looking from
one to the other both of them
resembled him not exactly there
were differences of expression and
they did not dress as he did nor wear
their hair just as he did-browns
hair was very sleek and flat  his
head unless his progress through
space had changed that but they
looked sufficiently like him to make
the coincidence a strange one and to
give him a strange sensation as ho
regarded them

  one spoke to brown he brown
at ouce decided was the more attrac-
tive of the two the more desirable
version of himself if they did
resemble him as much as he thought
as he looked longer at their faces
differences between themselves and
him between each of them and the
other became apparent this one
who spoke now was shrewder keener-
iooking more clever and snappy a
good businessman type according to
browns standard

  i came to offer you convoy he
said in a voice that matched well with
his appearance the trails here
arent well marked unless you know
how to see them i will be very glad
to take you with me and keep you
with me while you stay youre the
kind of man we want where i come
from weve watched you  earth
you are the surviving type the type
of man who gets ahead as you say
there the same qualities are just
as desirable where i reside as they are
 earth we saw you when you
earned your last raise from your firm
and youre the kind of man we
want

  brown felt a warm glow pervade
what he supposed was his astral body


welr tales

then he had a surviving part yes-
a soul and what you did on earth
counted after you went out-went on
and on with you that was good
he was a surviving type that was
putting il neatly and nietsches
philosophy which had always
appealed to him because he had
always felt that way about himself
wasnt so badly received in the next
world as the old-fashioned moralists
liked to think it would be

  but at t his point his thoughts were
interrupted by the other man who
still held his right hand

   came to offer my convoy too
he said but ill tell you frankly
that youll have to change a good bit
if you want to get along if you go
with me  know a good deal about
you too brown i know about the
raise you earned recently-you
misrepresented the work of a good
man and kept him from getting the
salary ol the work be was doing so
because you cut down the salary roll
you managed to get yourself a good
whack-off thats the truth about
the way you earned that raise isnt
it  

  brown looked at the speaker and
disliked him it wasnt only what he
said he was a type brown hated a
type lie had once feared he had it in
him to be lie had standardized him-
self now and his personality was
nothing but an asset but when he
was a boy he had come very near to
turning into an impractical dreamer
sort of fellow the sort people accused
of having too many ideals a person
who looked like this one who was
speaking to him and as brown had
once been afraid he would look
would be capable of just this sort of
judgment and this lack of tact

  brown laughed a little light-
headedly as if the morphine which
had been shot into his corporeal body
had slightly affected his astral one

  it seems to me that we have more
in common he replied to the last
speaker indicating the other with an

inclination of his head so i guess
i will choose accordingly im quite
as much obliged

  a second more and the undesired
guide had disappeared

tt k was rushing along again but in
a definite directed manner the
floating whirling sensation and the
feeling of being loosed from the
chains of gravity and horribly lost
without them were gone and again
his feet found foothold and they
were walking hand in hand a door
seemed to open before them a close
passageway engulfed them and the
way seemed too narrow then it
widened out and they stood together
he and lis guide in a strange place
in-

  hell brown screamed horribly
and struggled with his guide let
me go let me go back you didnt
tell me fhat was what i was deciding
my god fiive me a chance i didnt
know  didnt want to go to hell

  a cikhus of laughter greeted his
ravings

  the only myth is that there are
myths

  somewhere brown had read that
it flashed across his mind now even
in his first panic it meant that back
of every myth every legend every
superstition was somewhere-a fact
and sometimes at least that was true
the references to hell that brown had
read in the bible as a child-the rav-
ings of itinerant preachers-the ma-
jestic dreadful imaginings of milton

-shakespeare- he thought of

lady macbeths words my lord
hell is murky it was

  it was as though the light was of
low vibration in quality just over the
line from heat and it was hot just
endurable enough as to excess heat
so that it could be endured so that
one kept there long enough would
wish it were not endurable so that
there might be an end also there
were swooping shadows and darting
reflections of great lurid flames so
an adventure in anesthesia



that brown felt that the worst was
as yet beyond his imagining it was
no modified hades but the old-
fashioned hell that on earth has be-
come more a joke than a legend but
here it was no joke

  and yet none of this was what
made the place so horrible that
brown screamed and raved and
struggled and would rather have
died than come through the door and
the narrow passage if he had known
it was the things in the place-
things to which not the bible
the itinerant preachers milton
shakespeare nor any of the others
had done justice deformed mon-
strosities-there were too many of
them if one of them ever lived in
any form approaching the present
one it would have been hard for it
not to merit hell and probably
many of them had grown here
progressively worse for a long long
time so that their like could never
have been seen on earth

  but there were human things and
things that had changed from
humanity so that brown was not
sure there was a man with a
hideous mad face carrying the dead
body of a woman and beating it
constantly over the head

  that man killed his wife brown
heard in his ear so his punish-
ment partly is to carry her so
through all eternity beating her like
that as he did when he killed her a
century from now as you count you
wont recognize either one of them
they will have become so much
worse  

  but she-she was his victim
why does she stay here

  browns teeth chattered but his
curiosity was awakening

 she-oh she deserved to be
killed you see she got what was
coming to her so here they both
are  

  the speaker standing somewhere
behind brown broke off in a peal
of the wild echoing laughter that

seemed to greet everything of a hor-
rible or distressful nature brown
was reminded of an insane asylum
he had once visited

  another figure caught his eye-a
man who must have come lately for
there was a natural human look about
him that warmed browns trembling
heart but-he had strapped to him
somehow a coil of tubing that ended
in an ordinary gas jet just in front of
his nostrils so that he seemed con-
stantly in the throes of suffocation
and disgust at the smell of fumes
which issued from the jet like ordi-
nary illuminating-gas from a gas
light the unfortunate creature kept
trying to turn his head away but the
jet with the nauseating fumes turned
with him

   knew of someone-i heard of
someone lately-- began brown

  yes hallam thats ilallam
the unseen voice resumed explana-
tions you see he killed himself to
get to heaven but theres an old old
law against that so he was sent here
because he was a suicide his punish-
ment partly is to go on enduring the
pain sickness disgust and regret that
lie felt just before he passed out
they expect to go through that stage
but they dont know that they go
right on going through it until its
too late

  brown turned quickly he could
not bear to hear again that laugh
which he was sure was about to follow
these words and having turned he
encountered a look which made the
laugh unnecessary-a look that in
itself made a mock of all decent feel-
ing pity and sympathy and the
look was on the unspeakably evil face
and out of the unspeakably evil eyes
of a gentleman in red with a horn in
the center of his forehead and one
cloven hoof where his right foot
should be

  the only myth is that there are
myths thought brown again and
suddenly became aware that the place
was full of smaller subservient-


weird tales

appearing beings decorated each with
one horn and a single cloven hoof
but-

  the devil interrupted his half-
formed thought

  they do exaggerate things he
sneered one horn is enough and
one hoof is enough and one of each
is easier to disguise than two when
we go to earth as some of us do i
do quite often some of our in-
formation on your case i gathered
myself you dont amount to much
but you have some very nasty ten-
dencies you havent had much
chance your environment nearly
turned you into a good man but youre
our own soil you might go a long
way with us if you try to fit in with
our ways so what do you say

  the question had a familiar ring
like an echo

  i say lets go brown was
quoting himself but he was not quite
sure just when he had said that
recently lefore i say its a hard
life and ill try to make the best of
it he enlarged

  thats good said the devil
giving him a violent blow on the
forehead with something hard and
sharp we all wear those

  those were the horns brown
dizzy with pain had put up his hand
and felt a distinct bump springing
up on his forehead it would not be
a very well-defined horn but he was
marked still dizzy with pain and
shock suddenly he was seized again
with panic he wanted to die but
souls did not die an awful despair
settled down on him so that he hardly
listened to what was being said to
him

  theres a real reason for that
he finally caught your astral and
physical bodies are still connected
and that blow has an effect on your
brain cells as well when you go
back you will be surprized at your-
self you will be quite a different
sort of person and you will be able
to confer distinguishing marks on

people who are near and dear to you
and who love you now and then oh
yes many-very many-of the old
legends have foundations but you
wont exactly love those who are near
and dear to you after you go back
you will-well you will see how-
ever youll keep our patents of
nobility  

  brown felt of his head again it
was less painful pondering over the
devils last words he looked at the
devils cloven hoof

  a token like that would be em-
barrassing on earth he suggested

  you cnt be too particular
retorted the devil

  he signed to browns guide whom
brown had forgotten

  take him back-for the present
he said shortly

  brown was hurried toward the
narrow passageway at its entrance
he held back curiosity once more
dominant

  newton meredith and canby
who took ethysene-did they come
here and go back to earth or did
they go to heaven

  the devil burst into a paroxysm of
laughter he was hideous when he
laughed and more evil than at any
other time

  that brings us to one of the best
jokes of the ages he finally gasped
while people on earth are quarrel-
ing over the question of evolution it
seems impossible that not one of them
has even guessed at the truth of the
matter whats the matter with
their brains they were supposed
to have been endowed with good
brains through evolution and one
thing and another but speaking of
evolution-you know their bodies
evolved from the ape oh yes but
a dual race developed one branch
was endowed with a soul with
individual souls you know-it was
done with the best of intentions ha
ha the other branch dies as dead
as a dog or cat naturally ethysene
would not affect members of that
an adventure in anesthesia



branch newton meredith and canby
all belonged to that family see you
and hallam belong to the other
branch having souls-and here you
both are pretty good batting aver-
age for hell is it not 

  if they guessed it on earth all
the savants would be laying claims to
personal souls instead of disclaiming
their existence but the cream of the
joke is that while many who are sure
they have souls have them and many
who are sure they have none have
none-just as many are sure they
have souls and then die like their ape
forefathers and as many who are
sure they have none find out too late
that they have

  complicated but good think it
over  	

  brown pushed into the smother-
ing close passageway was thinking
it was a good joke although it was
on him too

npiikv said that brown came out of
the anesthetic in fine shape but
he could not agree witl them lie
was utterly miserable if that was be-
ing in fine shape lie was burning
and cold as though he had been
chilled by some wind between the
worlds of consciousness and scorched
by a hot unhealthful vapor

  people seemed to have changed in
their attitude toward him and he
toward them he had been a hospital
favorite now one would hardly call
him that he was strangely sensitive
about one of his feet-the right one
he moved it as though it were stiff
or injured or in pain although it
was none of these things he felt
as though when he walked again he
would walk with a halt perhaps it
had something to do with the appen-
dicitis which had sent stabs of pain
shoot ing down his right leg before the
operation or perhaps it had some-
thing to do with-something he had
dreamed

  another thing which he tried not
to think of was the discolored contu-

sion which he wore down from the
operating-room there were com-
ments about that and dismay some
carelessness must be responsible for
it carelessness in moving him or in
handling him but when the house
doctor tried to tell him how sorry he
was that it should have happened
brown taught him not to discuss the
personal appearance of his patients
by unleashing upon him a devil of a
temper that he lid not remember
ever having displayed before in his
life

  it developed during browns con-
valescence that the nurse dorothy
wood was more deeply smitten with
him than he had known-a phenom-
enon which before his operation he
would have hailed with almost in-
credulous delight as it was the
childish little nurse was the only
thing about the hospital which
amused him it amused him to lead
her on to talk tenderly to him to
show her anxiety for him to show the
depth of the fears she had felt while
he lay unconscious it amused him
to see that she had thought he loved
her in that time which lay behind
his recent illness that she had
thought even thal he wanted to
marry her some day tp he had ever
hinted at such a thing it struck him
now as the essence of supreme humor
he brown wasnt going to marry
for love and a pretty face lie was
going to climb higher in the future
than he had ever climbed he knew
a girl lie could marry he hadnt
liked her over well in the past but
if he hadnt meant to marry her and
her bank account he must have been
light in the head tt was the
thing to do such chances didnt come
every day as for dorothy and
pretty little nobodies like her who
dreamed of catching a successful
man with nothing to offer but love
they would do to play with

  it was fun to make her break hos-
pital regulations and slip into his
room from her ward duty and stay


weird tales

for long talks that would have gotten
her discharged any time the head
nurse happened in when they put
her on night duty it was funnier still
bccause her discharge would have
been even more certain then and
because she was so forgetful of her-
self in her childish feeling for him

  at last one night when he had
progressed a long way back toward
health and strength he drew her
head down to his pillow and kissed
her squarely on the lips it was a
long kiss and when it was over
dorothy slipped swiftly to the floor
not to her feet-that would have put
her too far from him to her knees
so that their faces were still on a
level her regard for professional
etiquette which had been deeply
rooted in her once had been able to
do so much toward separating them
but it could do  more

  she knelt there looking at him
and brown looking at her trans-
figured face felt the laugh freeze on
his lips

  it had been fun to play with her
to see how far he could make her
go in the breaking of the rigid laws
she was bound to obey it had been
fun to see how easily he could get
that kiss-the first he had ever had
from her but there was something
now about her eyes-

  they were the eyes of a little girl
to whom fairyland has opened they
were the eyes of a very young girl
whose first dream of love has come
true they were the eyes of an angel
-of a woman-

  they made another face rise before
browns minds eye-a face like
his which seemed made to answer
that new look on dorothys face a
facc like his and yet not quite like
his a face that might belong to a
man with a touch of the visionary in
him with a bit of other-worldliness
about him that didnt fit in with the
picture of a successful executive per-
haps-a face that might be framed by
hair a bit unruly and unheeded

because its owners eyes were  far
things

  and then both faces-dorothys
face and that other face of browns
fancy-were put out of the fore-
ground by the consciousness that a
third face very real and near was
peering through a crack in the door

  it was the head nurse it was a
face which must have been created
especially to be the face of a head
nurse

  ive been watching you for some
time miss wood it said trium-
phantly i think youll find there
isnt room on our hospital staff for
girls of your sort who are capable of
such indiscretions as this i think
youll find it hard to get on the staff
of another hospital i have never
been so outraged-right under my
nose miss-

  the head nurse was working her-
self up

  dorothy wood put out her hands
only a little way in a broken gesture
of pleading

 oh please- she said to

brown

  it wasnt clear just what she
wanted of him but she wanted some
intervention that only he could give
it flashed through browns mind that
if he said they were engaged the
hospital board might have clemency
it might mean a hard thing in a
girls life to be discharged from
a nursing staff with a bad character
it wouldnt hurt him to say that
saving thing even if he never mar-
ried her it wouldnt hurt-

  but why should he what had he
to gain by shielding this girl who
seemed so sure that he had once been
very fond of her that she hadnt
discerned the change in his nature
which he himself knew to have taken
place it was all rather funny

  he wanted to laugh the head
nurses expression and dorothys ex-
pression were so very funny in their
solemn assumption that this affair
was a thing of great importance to
an adventure in anesthesia



everybody it wasnt important to
brown and it neednt be say
dorothy wood was fired tomorrow
and he never saw her again and the
head nurse glared at him until he
went home quite well-would he
remember the incident a year from
now his was to be a busy life a
life of climbing over other people to
the top which only the fit attained

  he did laugh flinging out his arms
in a sudden passionate enjoyment of
the joke while the two women stared
at him dorothy still on her knees
in her eyes something was dying
and something was springing to life
his carelessly outflung hand struck
against her forehead-not very hard
-just with the knuckle he was
watching that new look in her eyes-
a something hard and reckless and
not in the least childish and then he
saw the mark that he had made upon
the smooth whiteness of her forehead

  where had he seen one just like
that before a swelling bruise a
discolored contusion-why it was
very like the one he had worn down
from the operating-room-the sight
of which stirred those awful mem-
ories he had put away from him with
such an effort

  he heard his own voice laughing
on what devil had he heard laugh
somewhere like that he thought
the word   devil   as one thinks those
epithets carelessly expecting to
recall the laugh of some malicious
practical joker of his acquaintance
but it recalled something more than
that

  a scene of lurid darkness a blow
a thing that laughed and a promise
that he would be able to present
certain little tokens to those who
loved him-

  the laugh died in browns throat
and he screamed sharply in anguish

  oh its a mistake-a horrible
mistake i never meant-

  the bitter look in dorothys eyes
wavered her gaze was fixed upon
him trustingly again she thought
he meant to speak up in her behalf
at last

  once more for a fleeting instant
he saw that other vision of himself
a man who had kindness written in
his face and not much thought of
self like one reaching in the dark
for a friendly hand he felt himself
reaching out toward it it was a face
which mightnt get on-but it was a
face which would be strangely out of
place in-

  he touched the bruise  the young
nurses head with pitiful tender
fingers

  i didnt mean to do that he
said gently i didnt mean to get
you into trouble either please dont
report her-dont be hard  her i
came to this hospital because we are
sweethearts we havent told anyone
of our engagement yet but thats why
she was so indiscreet and because
ive coaxed her to spend a few
minutes here now and then against
the rules shes been worried about
me since ive been here you dont
have to report her because ive been
selfish and she a little foolish do you
nurse   

  a heaviness seemed to be lifting
from the air of the little room there
was a cool sweet bioeze blowing in
at the window from some place where
there were many flowers

  the head nurse smiled

  if youll both have respect for
the rules in future ill let this go
she said after all the hospital
owes you something sir we dont
often get our patients injured in
handling-

  ill declare im right glad to sec
that mark fading from your fore-
head its odd youve bruised miss
wood s forehead in the same place
but hers wont show by tomorrow

by pedro antonio de alarcon

ow little we really know my
friends how little we really
know

 the speaker was gabriel a dis-
tinguished civil engineer of the moun-
tain corps he was seated under a
pine-tree near a spring on the crest
of the guadarrama it was only
about a league and a half distant from
the palace of the escurial on the
boundary line of the provinces of
madrid and segovia i know the
place spring pine-tree and all but i
have forgotten its name

 lot us sit down went on ga-
briel as that is the correct thing to
do and as our program calls for a
rest here--here in this pleasant and
classic spot famous for the digestive
properties of that spring and for the
many lambs here devoured by our
noted teachers don miguel bosch
don maximo laguna don augustin
pascual and other illustrious nat-
uralists sit down and i will tell you
a strange and wonderful story in
proof of my thesis which is though
you call me an obscurantist for it
ihat supernatural events still occur on

	his terraqueous globe i mean events
which you can not get into terms of
reason or science or philosophy -
as those words words words in

   translated from the spanish

       

hamlets phrase are understood or
are not understood today

  gabriel was addressing his ani-
mated remarks to five persons of dif-
ferent ages none of them was young
though only one was well along in
years three of them were like
gabriel engineers the fourth was a
painter and the fifth was a litterateur
in a small way in company with the
speaker who was the youngest we
had all ridden up on hired mules from
the real sitio de san lorenzo to
spend the day botanizing among the
beautiful pine groves of pequerinos
chasing butterflies with gauze nets
catching rare beetles under the bark
of the decayed pines and eating a
cold lunch out of a hamper which we
had paid for on shares

  this took place in  it was the
height of the summer i do not re-
member avhether it was saint james
day or saint louis i am inclined to
think it was saint louis which-
ever it was we enjoyed a delicious
coolness at that height and the heart
and brain as well as the stomach
were there in much better working
order than usual

  when the six friends were seated
gabriel continued as follows

  i do not think you will accuse me
of being a visionary luckily or un-
the tall woman



luckily i am if you will allow me to
say so a man of the modem world
i have no superstition about me and
am as much of a positivist as the best
of them although i include among the
positive data of nature all the mys-
terious faculties and feelings of the
soul well then apropos of super-
natural or extra-natural phenomena
listen to what i have seen and heard
although i was not the real hero of the
very strange story i am going to re-
late and then tell me what explana-
tion of an earthly physical or natural
sort however you may name it can be
given of so wonderful an occurrence

  the case was as follows but

this time in that bubbling crystalline

 vkell gentlemen i do not know

  	 whether you ever heard of an
engineer of the roads corps named

telesforo x- he died in 

  no i havent

  but i have

  so have i he was a young fel-
low from andalusia with a black
mustache he was to have married the
marquis of moredas daughter but he
died of jaundice

  the very one said gabriel
well then my friend telesforo six
months before his death was still a
most promising young man as they
say nowadays he was good-loolcing
well built energetic and had the
glory of being the first one in his class
to be promoted he had already
gained distinction in the practise of
his profession through some fine
pieces of work several different com-
panies were competing for his serv-
ices and many marriageable women
were also competing for him but
telesforo as you said was faithful to
poor joaquina moreda

  as you know it turned out that
she died suddenly at the baths of
santa agueda at the end of the sum-
mer of  i was in pau when i
received the sad news of her death
which affected me very much on ac-
count of my close friendship with
telesforo with her i had spoken
only once in the house of her aunt
the wife of general lopez and i cer-
tainly thought her bluish pallor a
symptom of bad health but how-
ever that may be she had a dis-
tinguished manner and a great deal of
grace and was besides the only
daughter of a title and a title that
carried some comfortable thousands
with it so i felt sure my good
mathematician would be inconsolable
consequently as noon as i was back
in madrid fifteen or twenty days
after his loss i went to see him very
early one morning he lived in ele-
gant bachelor quarters in lobo street
-i do not remember the number but
it was near the carrera de san jero-
nimo

    the young engineer was very
melancholy although calm and ap-
parently master of his grief he was
already at work even at that hour
laboring with his assistants over some
railroad plans or other he was
dresed in deep mourning

  he greeted me with a long and
close embrace without so much as
sighhig then lue gave some direc-
tions to his assistants about the work
in hand and afterward led me to his
private office at the farther end of the
house as we were on our way there
he said in a sorrowful tone and with-
out glancing at me

   i am very glad you have come
several times i have found myself
wishing you were here a very
strange thing has happened to me
only a friend such as you are can
hear of it without thinking me either
a fool or crazy i want to get an
opinion about it as calm and cool as
science itself


weird tales

   sit down he went on when we
lad readied lis office and do not
imagine that i am going to afflict you
with a description of the sorrow i
am suffering-a sorrow which will last
as long as i live why should i you
can easily picture it to yourself little
as you know of trouble and as for
being comforted t do not wish to be
either now or later or ever what
i am going to speak to you about
with the requisite deliberation going
back to the very beginning of the
thing is a horrible and mysterious oc-
currence which was an infernal omen
of my calamity and which has dis-
tressed me in a frightful manner 

   go on i replied sitting down
the fact was i almost repented
having entered the house as i saw the
expression of abject fear on my
friends face

   listen then said he wiping the
perspiration from his forehead



  t no not know whether it is due to
some inborn fatality of imagina-
tion or to having heard some story or
other of the kind with which children
are so rashly allowed o be fright-
ened but the fact is that since my
earliest years nothing has caused me
so much horror and alarm as a woman
alone in the street at a late hour of
the night the effect is the same
whether i actually encounter her or
simply have an image of her in my
mind

   you can testify that  was never
a coward i fought a duel once when
i had to like any other man just
after i had left the school of engi-
neers my workmen in despenaperros
revolted and i fought them with stick
and pistol until i made them submit
all my life long in jaen in madrid
and elsewhere i have walked the
streets at all hours alone and un-
armed and if i have chanced to
run upon suspicious-looking persons
thieves or mere sneaking beggars

they have had to get out of my way
or take to their heels but if the per-
son turned out to be a solitary woman
standing still or walking and i was
also alone with no one in sight in any
direction-then laugh if you want to
but believe me t would be all cov-
ered over with goose-flesh vague
fears would assail me i would think
about beings of the other world about
imaginary existences and about all
the superstitious stories which would
make me laugh under other circum-
stances i would quicken my pace or
else turn back and would not get over
my fright in the least until safe in my
own house

   once there i would fall a-laugh-
ing and would be ashamed of my
crazy fears the only comfort i had
was that nobody knew anything about
it then i would dispassionately re-
mind myself that i did not believe in
goblins witches or ghosts and that i
had no reason whatever to be afraid
of that wretched woman driven from
her home at such an hour by poverty
or some crime or accident to whom
i might better have offered help if
she needed it or given alms never-
theless the pitiable scene would be
gone over again as often as a similar
thing occurred-and remember that t
was twenty-four years old that i had
experienced a great many adventures
by night and yet that i had never
had the slightest difficulty of any sort
with such solitary women in the
streets after midnight but nothing
of what i have so far told you ever
came to have any importance sinee
that irrational fear always left me as
soon as i reached home or saw any-
one else in the street and i would
scarcely recall it a few minutes after-
ward auv more than one would recall
a stupid mistake which had no result
of any consequence

   things were going on so when
nearly three years ago unhappily t
have good reason for knowing the
date it was the night of november
-  i was coming home at
the tall woman



	in the morning as you remember
 was living then in that little house
in jardines street near montera
street i had just come at that late
hour a bitter cold wind blowing at
the time out ot a sort of a gambling-
house-  tell you this although i
know it will surprize you you know
that  am not a gambler  went into
the place deceived by an alleged
friend but the fact was that as
people began to drop in about mid-
night coming from receptions or the
theater the play began o be very
heavy and one saw the gleam of gold
in plenty then came bank-bills and
notes of hand little by little  was
carried away by the feverish and se-
ductive passion and lost all the
money  had i even went away
owing a round sum for which  had
left my note behind me in short i
ruined myself completely and but for
the legacy that came to me after-
ward together with the good jobs i
have had my situation would have
been extremely critical and painful

   so  was going home i say at
so late an hour that night numb with
the cold hungry ashamed and dis-
gusted as you can imagine thinking
about my sick old father more than
about myself i should have to write
to him for money and this would
astonish as much as it would grieve
him since he thought me in very easy
circumstances just before reaching
my street where it crosses peligros
street as  was walking in front of a
newly built house i perceived some-
thing in its doorway it was a tali
large woman standing stiff and mo-
tionless as if made of wood she
seemed to be about sixty years old
her bold and malignant eyes un-
shaded by eyelashes were fixed on
mine like two daggers her toothless
mouth made a horrible grimace at me
meant to be a smile

   the very terror or delirium of
fear which instantly overcame me gave
me somehow a most acute perception
so that i coiild distinguish at a glance

in the two seconds it took me to pass
by that repugnant vision the slightest
details of her face and dress let me
sec if i can put together my impres-
sions in the way and form in which i
received them as they were engraved
ineffaceably on my brain in the light
of the street-lamp which shone luridly
over that ghastly scene but t am
exciting myself too much though
there is reason enough for it as you
will see further on dont be con-
cerned however for the state of my
mind i am not yet crazy

   the first thing which struck me
in that woman as  will call her was
her extreme height and the breadth
of her bony shoulders then the
roundness and fixity of her dry owl-
ish eyes the enormous size of her pro-
truding nose and the great dark
cavern of her mouth finally her
dress like that of a young woman of
avapies-the new little cotton hand-
kerchief which she wore on her head
tied under her chin and a diminutive
fan which she carried opened in her
hand and with which in affected
modesty she was covering the middle
of her waist

   nothing could he at the same
time more ridiculous and more aw-
ful move laughable and more taunt-
ing than that little fan in those huge
hands it seemed like a make-be-
lieve scepter in the hands of such
an old hideous and bony giantess
a like effect was produced by the
showy percale handkerchief adorn-
ing her face by the side of that cut-
water nose hooked and masculine
for a moment i was led to believe
or i was very glad to that if was
a man in disguise

   but her cynical glance and
harsh smile were those of a hag of a
witch an enchantress a fate a-t
know not what there was some-
thing about her to justify fully the
aversion and fright which t had been
caused all my life long by women
walking alone in the streets at night
one would have said that i had had


weird tales

a presentiment of that encounter
from my cradle one would have said
that i was frightened by it instinctive-
ly as every living being fears and
divines and scents and recognizes
its natural enemy before ever being
injured by it before ever having
seen it and solely on hearing its
tread

   i did not dash away in a run
when i saw my lifes sphinx i re-
strained my impulse to do so less out
of shame and manly pride than out
of fear lest my very fright should
reveal to her who i was or should
give her wings to follow me to over-
take me-i do not know what panic
like that dreams of dangers which
have neither form nor name

   my house was at the opposite
end of the long and narrow street
in which i was alone entirely alone
with that mysterious phantom whom
i thought able to annihilate me with
a word how should i ever get
home oh how anxiously i looked
toward that distant montera street
broad and well lighted where there
are policemen to be found at all
hours i decided finally to get the
better of my weakness to dissemble
and bide that wretched fear not to
hasten my pace but to keep on ad-
vancing slowly even at the cost of
years of health or life and in this
way little by little to go on getting
nearer to my house exerting myself
to the utmost not to fall fainting on
the ground before i reached it

   i was walking along in this way
-i must have taken about twenty
steps after leaving behind me the
doorway where the woman with the
fan was hidden when suddenly a
horrible idea came to me-horrible
yet very natural nevertheless-the
idea that i would look back to see
if my enemy was following me one
thing or the other i thought with
the rapidity of a flash of lightning
either my alarm has some foundation
or it is madness if it has any

foundation this woman will have
started after me will be overtaking
me and there is no hope for me on
earth but if it is madness a mere
supposition a panic fright like any
other i will convince myself of it in
the present instance and for every
case that may occur hereafter by
seeing that that poor old woman has
stayed in that doorway to protect
herself from the cold or to wait till
the door is opened and thereupon i
can go on to my house in perfect
tranquillity and i shall have cured
myself of a fancy that causes me
great mortification

   this reasoning gone through
with i made an extraordinary effort
and turned my head ah gabriel
gabriel how fearful it was the
tall woman had followed me with
silent tread was right over me al-
most touching me with her fan al-
most leaning her head on my
shoulder

   why was she doing it-why
my gabriel was she a thief was
she really a man in disguise was
she some malicious old hag who had
seen that i was afraid of her was
she a specter conjured up by my
very cowardice was she a mock-
ing fantasm of human self-deception

   i could never tell you all i
thought in a single moment if the
truth must be told i gave a scream
and flew away like a child of four
years who thinks he sees the black
man i did not stop running until
i got out into montera street once
there my fear left me like magic in
spite of the fact that that street also
was deserted then i turned my
head to look back to jardines street
i could see down its whole length
it was lighted well enough for me to
see the tall woman if she had drawn
back in any direction and by
heaven i could not see her standing
still walking or in any way how-
ever i was very careful not to go
back into that street again the
the tall woman



wretch i said to myself has slunk
into some other doorway but she
cant move without my seeing her

   just then i saw a policeman
coming up caballero de gracia
street and i shouted to him without
stirring from my place i told him
that there was a man dressed as a
woman in jardines street i direct-
ed him to go round by the way of
peligros and aduana streets while
i would remain where i was and in
that way the fellow who was prob-
ably a thief or murderer could not
escape us the policeman did as i
said he went through aduana
street and as soon as i saw his lan-
tern coming along jardines street i
also went up it resolutely 

 we soon met at about the
middle of the block without either
of us having encountered a soul al-
though we had examined door after
door

    he has got into some house
said the policeman

    that must be so i replied
opening my door with the fixed pur-
pose of moving to some other street
the next day

   a few moments later i was in
my room i always carried my latch-
key so as not to have to disturb my
good jose nevertheless he was
waiting for me that night my mis-
fortunes of the th and th of no-
vember were not yet ended

    what has happened i asked
him in surprize

    major falcon was here he
replied with evident agitation
waiting for you from  till half-
past  and told me that if you came
home to sleep you had better not un-
dress as he would be back at day-
break  

   those words left me trembling
with grief and alarm as if they had
piedicted my own death to me i
knew that my beloved father at his
home in jaen had been suffering fre-
quent and dangerous attacks of his
chronic disease t had written to my

brothers that if there should be a
sudden and fatal termination of the
sickness they were to telegraph
major falcon who would inform me
in some suitable way i had not the
slightest doubt therefore that my
father had died

   i sat down in an armchair to
wait for the morning and my friend
and with them the news of my
great misfortune god only knows
what i suffered in those two cruel
hours of waiting all the while
three distinct ideas were inseparably
joined in my mind though they
seemed unlike they took pains as it
were to keep in a dreadful group
they were my losses at play my
meeting with the tall wroman and
the death of my revered father

   precisely at  major falcon
came into my room and looked at
me in silence i threw myself into
his arms weeping bitterly and he
exclaimed caressing me

    yes my dear fellow aveep
weep 



atv friend telesforo gabriel

    a wtent on after having drained
another glass of wtine also iested
a moment when he reached this
point and then he proceeded as fol-
lows

   if my story ended here per-
haps you would not find anything
extraordinary or supernatural in it
you would say to me the same thing
that men of good judgment said to
me at that time that everyone who
has a lively imagination is subject to
some impulse of fear or other that
mine came from belated solitary
women and that the old creature of
jardines street was only some home-
less waif who was going to beg of
me when i screamed and ran

   for my part i tiied to believe
that it was so i even came to be-
lieve it at the end of several months
still t would have given years of my


weird tales

life to be sure that  was not again
to encounter the tall woman but
today i would give every drop of
my blood to be able to meet her
again

   what for

   to kill her on the spot

    do not understand you

   you will understand me when
i tell you that i did meet her again
three weeks ago a few hours before
i had the fatal news of my poor
joaquinas death

   tell me about it tell me about
it

   there is little more to tell it
was  oclock in the morning it was
not yet fully light though the dawn
was visible from the streets looking
toward the east the street lamps
had just been put out and the police-
men had withdrawn as  was go-
ing through prado street so as to
get to the other end of lobo street
the dreadful woman crossed in front
of me she did not look at me and
i thought she had not seen me

   she wore the same dress and
carried the same fan as three years
before my trepidation and alarm
were greater than ever i ran rapidly
across prado street as soon as she had
passed although i did not take my
eyes off her so as jo make sure that
she did not look back and when 
had reached the other end of lobo
street i panted as if  had just swum
an impetuous stream then i pressed
on with fresh speed toward home
filled now with gladness rather than
fear lor i thought that the hateful
witch had been conquered and shorn
of her power from the very fact that
i had been so near her and yet that
she not seen me

   but soon and when t had
almost reached this house a rush of
fear swept over me in the thought
that the crafty old hag had seen and
recognized me that she had made a
pretense of not knowing me so as to
let me get into lobo street where it
was still rather dark and where she

might set upon me in safety that she
would follow me that she was already
over me

  upon this i looked around-
and there she was there at my
shoulder almost touching me with her
clothes gazing at me with her
horrible little eyes displaying the
gloomy cavern of her mouth fanning
herself in a mocking manner as if to
make fun of my childish alarm

   t passed from dread to the most
furious anger to savage and desper-
ate rage  dashed at the heavy old
creature i flung her against the
wall  put my hand to her throat
i felt of her face her breast the
straggling locks of her gray hair
until i was thoroughly convinced that
she was a human being-a woman

   meanwhile she had uttered a
howl which was hoarse and piercing
at the same time it seemed false and
feigned to me like the hypocritical
expression of a fear which she did not
really feel immediately afterward
she exclaimed making believe cry
though she was not crying but look-
ing at me with her hyena eyes

 why have you picked a
quarrel with me

   this remark increased my fright
and weakened my wrath

    then you remember i cried
that you have seen me somewhere
else

    i should say so my dear she
replied mockingly saint eugenes
night in jardines street three years
ago

   my very marrow was chilled

    but who are you i asked
without letting go of her why do
you follow me what business have
you with me

    i am a poor weak woman
she answered with a devilish leer
you hate me and you ire afraid of
me without any reason if not tell
me good sir why you were so
frightened the first time you saw
me 
the tall woman



    because i have loathed you
ever since i was bora because you
are the evil spirit of my life

  it seems then that you have
known me for a long time well
look my son so have i known you
  you have known me how
long

    since before you were born
and when i saw you pass by me
three years ago i said to myself
thats the one

    but what am i to you what
are you to me

    the devil replied the hag
spitting full in my face freeing her-
self from my grasp and running
away with amazing swiftness she
held her skirts higher than her knees
and her feet did not make the
slightest noise as they touched the
ground

   it was madness to try to catch
her besides people were already
passing through the carrera de san
jeronimo and in prado street too
it was broad daylight the tall
woman kept on running or flying as
far as huertas street which was now
lighted up by the sun there she
stopped to look back at me she
waved her closed fan at me once or
twice threateningly and then dis-
appeared around a comer

   wait a litle longer gabriel do
not yet pronounce judgment in this
case where my life and soul are con-
cerned listen to me two minutes
longer

   when i entered my house i met
colonel falcon who had just come
to tell me that my joaquina my
betrothed all my hope and happi-
ness and joy on earth had died the
day before in santa agueda the un-
fortunate father had telegraphed
falcon to tell me-me who should
have divined it an hour before when
i met the evil spirt of my life dont
you understand now that i must kill
that bom enemy of my happiness
that vile old hag who is the living
mockery of my destiny 

   but why do i say kill is she
a woman is she a human being
why have i had a presentiment of her
ever since i was born why did she
recognize me when she first saw me
why do i never see her except when
some great calamity has befallen me
is she satan is she death is she
life is she antichrist who is
she what is she



 t will spare you my dear
- friends continued gabriel
the argumentsand remarks which
i used to see if i could not calm
telesforo for they are the same
precisely the same which you are
preparing now to advance to prove
that there is nothing supernatural or
superhuman in my story you will
even go further you will say that my
friend was half crazy that he always
was so that at least he suffered
from that moral disease which some
call panic terror and others emo-
tional insanity that even granting
the truth of what i have related about
the tall woman it must all be referred
to chance coincidences of dates and
events and finally that the poor old
creature could also have been crazy
or a thief or a beggar or a procuress
-as the hero of my story said to him-
self in a lucid interval

  a very proper supposition ex-
claimed gabriels comrades that is
just what we were going to say
well listen a few minutes longer
and you will see that i was mistaken
at the time as you are mistaken now
the one who unfortunately made no
mistake was telesforo it is much
easier to speak the word insanity
than to find an explanation for some
things that happen on the earth

    speak speak  

  i am going to and this time as
it is the last i will pick up the thread
of my story without first drinking a
glass of wine


weird tales

g

 a few days after that conversa-
tion with telesforo  was sent
to the province of albacete in my
capacity as engineer of the mountain
corps not many weeks had passed
before j learned from a contractor
for public works that my unhappy
friend had been attacked by a dread-
ful form of jaundice it had turned
him entirely green and lie reclined in
an armchair without working or wish-
ing to see anybody weeping night
and day in inconsolable grief

  this made me understand why he
had not answered my letters i had
to resort to colonel falcon as a source
of nws of him and all the while the
reports kept getting more unfavorable
and gloomy

  after an absence of live months i
returned to madrid the same day that
the telegraph brought the news of the
battle of tetuan i remember it as if
it were yesterday that night  bought
the indispensable correspondmcia
de espaiia and the first thing i read
in it was the notice of telesforos
death his friends were invited to
the funeral the following morning

  you will be sure that i was
present as we arrived at the san
luis cemetery whither i rode in one
of the carriages nearest the hearse
my attention was called to a peasant
woman she was old and very tall
she was laughing sacrilegiously as
she saw them taking out the coffin
then she placed herself in front of
the pall-bcarers in a triumphant
attitude and pointed out o them with
a very small fan the passageway they
were to take to reach the open and
waiting grave

  at the first glance i perceived
with amazement and alarm that she
was telesforos implacable enemy
she was just as he had described her
to me-with her enormous nose her
devilish eyes her awful mouth her
percale handkerchief and that dimin-
utive fan which seemed in her hands

the scepter of indecency and mockery

  she immediately observed that i
was looking at her and fixed her gaze
upon me in a peculiar manner as if
recognizing me as if letting me know
that she recognized me as if
acquainted with the fact that the
dead man had told me about the
scenes in jardines street and lobo
street as if defying me as if declar-
ing me the inheritor of the hate which
she had cherished for my unfortunate
friend

  i confess that at the time my
fright was greater than my wonder
at those new coincidences and ac-
cidents it seemed evident to me
that some supernatural relation ante-
cedent to earthly life had existed
between the mysterious old woman
and telesforo but for the time being
my sole concern was about my own
life my own soul my own happiness
-all of which would be exposed to
the greatest peril if i should really
inherit such a curse

  the tall woman began to laugh
she pointed at me contemptuously
with the fan as if she had read my
thoughts and were publicly exposing
my cowardice i had to lean on a
friends arm to keep myself from
falling then she made a pitying or
disdainful gesture turned on her
heels and went into the cemetery
her head was turned toward me she
fanned herself and nodded to me at
the same time she sidled along among
the graves with an indescribable in-
fernal coquetry until at last she dis-
appeared forever in that labyrinth of
tombs

  i say forever since fifteen years
have passed and i have never seen her
again if she was a human being she
must have died before this  if she was
not i rest in the conviction that she
despised me too much to meddle with
me

 now then bring on your
theories give me your opinion about
hese strange events do you still
regard them as entirely natural
the weird the grotesque the abnormal the utterly unusual in litera-
ture have held a strange fascination for the reading public for
centuries though not until poes macabre genius devised an adequate
mechanism for such stories was the weird tale raised to the artistic heights it
has attained under such masters as blackwood mae hen ijovoeraft and others
the brilliant success of this magazine shows the extent to which the route
macabre has caught the imagination of discerning readers a letter from monte-
vallo alabama from one of our readers who signs himself i l s goes far
to explain the success which wkiki talks has experienced i have been
reading yinu talks since  at that time  had exhausted all of poes
works that i could lay my hands on and had come to the conclusion that as
far as further exploitation of the weird and gruesome in literalure was con-
cerned there just wasnt any more then t discovered wkikd talks and
i confess that i have enjoyed my wild and excited searching through each
copy since then for something grotesque and lovely in its grot esquen ess i
have in mind one tale by mr lovecraft in your magazine i think it was
called the white ship  hope my memory has not failed me on that point
for i hoped never to forget it it was serenely told furthermore it was
beautiful and conclusive proof that mr lovecrafts gift of word-painting is
at times beyond description

    writes tom cain of baltimore in a letter to the eyrie wmiin talks
certainly fills a crying need in these days of steadily increasing materialism
to get away from hard facts for awhile to soar into realms of bizarrerie

world we have to live in you have asked a few questions as to the readers
attitude toward your reprint policy well why not continue as at present
there is no better way than to reprint monthly in the magazine some famous

weird tales

publish let us say annually a volume of reprints from your magazine similar
to the moon terror i have noticed the list of requested stories in your
november issue it is quite proper that -the wind that tramps the world
should hold first place but any volume of reprints should certainly include
the tied brain by donald wandrei those two are real enduring literature
and weird tales should be congratulated on being first to publish them

    it was with a good deal of trepidation that we included captain george
fielding eliots story the copper bowl in our december issue for it was a
particularly gruesome story of torture and we did not know just how our
readers would receive it but our own judgment of the storys high merit
for the tale was extremely well told was confirmed by the letters from you
the readers only one story in the issue got more votes-and that was the
cover-design story featuring the inimitable jules de grandin

    i think i can safely give my vote of preference for the stories in the
december weird tales to the copper bowl writes h f seotten of in-
dianapolis captain eliot has succeeded in this story in exciting the
readers imagination to the extent that one is drawn willy-nilly into the
person of his hero suffering with him his loathing for his fellow enemy his
consuming anger his desperation incited by the suffering of his sweetheart
his raging attack on the torturers and finally the complete dissolution of his
sanity in my opinion captain eliot gave us a notable tale and there is the
inimitable de grandin again how does seabury quinn do it by all means
let us have a reprint of the wind that tramps the world i am sure that
your readers who have read it would enjoy it again and it would be a rare
treat for those who have not

    mrs edward mccann of dundalk maryland writes to the eyrie the
copper bowl was-well it cant be described it makes the hair rise yet on
the back of my neck to think of it beyond power of man by paul emst was
very fine everv time i looked around i expected to see or hear his giant
writes grace norton of san diego california i have just read my
first copy of your magazine admittedly to see if a plot which i have had in
mind for some time would fit it and i was delightfully surprized in the
quality of your stories from being a purely business proposition at first it
turned out to be an entertaining one-and i finished the magazine the evening
it was purchased and nlmost scared myself into sleeplessness by doing so
the stories are great the copper bowl is an unusual story even for grue-
someness it is splendidly written also the tinkle of the camels bell and
the chapel of mystic horror

    i have just read the conclusion of the werewolfs daughter by h
warner munn writes r e ingraham of greenville michigan that

at last we were speeding down the
street by which we had entered the
city and before us lay that streets
end with beyond it the vista of black
forest and glowing plain over which
we had come and now we were
racing over that glowing plain a
quarter-mile a half a mile   

  abruptly from far behind came the
calling crescendo notes of the mighty
horns marking the sleep-periods
end bringing back into the streets the
citys tentacle-people it could be but
moments now we knew before our
escape was discovered and as we
panted on at our highest speed we
listened for the sounding of the alarm
behind us

 it came when we had drawn to
within a half-mile of the black forest
where our cruiser lay hidden another
great tumult of horn-notes burst out
over the glowing city behind high
and shrill and raging and glancing
back we saw swarms of the black
cones rising from the pyramidal
buildings summits circling search-
ing speeding out over the glowing
plains around the city a compact
mass of them racing straight toward
us

last chance-to get to the cruiser

otaggering stumbling with the last
 of our strength we sped on over
the glowing soil and rocks toward the

a scant quarter-mile ahead then sud-

him then turned again as dal nara

cones above and two of them were
driving straight down toward us

crash down upon us from  hem then
suddenly a great dark shape loomed
in the air above and behind us from
which sprang out swift shafts of bril-
liant green light the dazzling de-
cohesion ray striking the two swoop-
ing cones and sending them down in
twin torrents of shattered wreckage
and now the mighty bulk behind us
swept swiftly down upon us and we
saw that it was our cruiser

 smoothly it shot down to the
ground and we stumbled to its side
through the waiting open door as f
staggered up to the bridgeroom the
third officer was shouting in my ear
we sighted you from the forest
he was crying came out in the
cruiser to get you-

  but now i was in he bridgeroom
brushing the wheelman from the con-
trols sending our ship slanting sharp-
ly up toward the zenith hums hoi
was at my side now-pointing toward
the great telechart and shouting some-
thing in my car i glanced over and
my heart stood still for the great
dark disk on the chart had swept
down to within an inch of the shining
line around our sun-eircle the dan-
ger-line

  the condenser  shouted we
must get to that switch-turn it off
its our only chance

  we were racing through the air to-
ward the luminous city now and
ahead a mighty swarm of the cones
was gathering and forming to meet
us while from behind and from each
side came other swarms driving on
toward us then the door clicked
open and dal nara burst into the
bridgeroom

  the ships ray-tubes are useless
she cried theyve used the last
charge in the ray-tanks

  at that cry the controls quivered
under my hands the ship slowed
stopped silence filled the bridge-
room filled all the cruiser the last
silence of despair we had failed
weaponless our ship hung there mo-
lionless while toward it from all di-

rod ions leaped the swift and swarm-
ing cones in dozens in scores in
hundreds leaping toward us long
black messengers of death while on
the great telechart the mighty dark
star leapt closer toward the shining
circle that was our sun toward the
fateful line around it we had
failed and death was upon us

  and now the black swarms of the
cones were very near us and were
slowing a little as though fearing
some ruse on our part were slowing
but moving closer closer while we
awaited them in a last utter stupor of
despair closer they came closer
closer   

  a ringing exultant cry suddenly
sounded from somewhere in the cruis-
er beneath me taken up by a sudden
babel of voices and then dal nara
cried out hoarsely beside me and
pointed up through our upper
observation-windows toward a long
shining slender shape that was
driving down toward us out of the
upper air while behind it drove a
vast swarm of other and larger
shapes long and black and mighty

    its our own ship   dal nara was
shouting insanely its ship 
they escaped got back to the galaxy
-and look there-behind them-its
ihe fleet the federation fleet

  there was a wild singing of blood
in ray ears as i looked up saw the
mighy swarm of black shapes that
were speeding down upon us behind
ihe shining cruiser the five thousand
mighty battle-cruisers of the federa-

swarms of cones around us in one
titanic simultaneous swoop

  then around us the air flashed bril-
liant with green ray and bursting
flares as de-cohesion rays and etheric
bombs crashed and burst from ship to
ship weaponless our cruiser hung
there at the center of that gigantic
battle while around us the mighty
cruisers of the galaxy and the long
black cones of the ten tael e-people
crashed and whirled and flared
swooping and dipping and racing
upon each other whirling down to
the glowing world below in scores of
shattered wrecks vanishing in silent
flares of blinding light from far
away across the surface of the lum-
inous world beneath the great swarms
of cones drove on toward the battle
from the shining towers of cities far
away racing fearlessly to the attack
sinking and falling and crumbling
beneath the terrible rays of the leap-
ing ships above ramming and crash-
ing with them to the ground in
sacrificial plunges but swiftly now
the cones were vanishing beneath the
brilliant rays

  then hums hoi was at my side
shouting and pointing down toward
the glowing city below the con-
denser he cried pointing to where
its blue radiance still flared on th
dark star-look he flung a hand
toward the telechart where the dark
star disk was but a scant half-inch
from the shining line around our sun-
circle a tiny gap that was swiftly
closing i glanced toward the battle
that raged around us where the
federation cruisers were sending the
cones down to destruction by swarms
now but unheeding of the condenser
below a bare half-mile beneath us
lay that condenser and its cage-pillar
switch which a single shaft of the
green ray would have destroyed
instantly and our ray-tubes were
useless

  then wild resolve flared up in my
brain and i slammed down the levers

down toward the condenser and its
upheld cage like a released thunder-
bolt of hurtling metal hold tight
i screamed as we thundered down
im going to ram the switch

  and now up toward us were rush-
ing the brilliant blue hemispheres of
the pit the great pillar and upheld
cage beside them toward which we
flashed with the speed of lightning
crash-and a tremendous shock
shook the cruiser from stem to stern
as its prow tore through the upheld
metal cage ripping it from its
supporting pillar and sending it
crashing to the ground our cruiser
spun hovered for a moment as though
to whirl down to destruction then
steadied while wre at the window
azed downward shouting

  for beneath us the blinding ra-
diance of the massed hemispheres had
suddenly snapped out around and
above us the great battle had died
the last of the cones tumbling to the
ground beneath the rays of the
mighty fleet and now we turned
swiftly to the telechart tensely we
scanned it upon it the great dark-
star disk was creeping still toward
the line around our smi-circle creep-
ing slower and slower toward it but
still moving on on on    had we
lost at the last moment now the
black disk hardly moving was all but
touching the shining line separated
from it by only a hairs-breadth gap
a single moment wre watched while it
hovered thus a moment in which was
settled the destiny of a sun and
then a babel of incoherent cries came
from our lips for the tiny gap was
widening

  the black disk was moving back
was curving outward again from our
sun and from the galaxys edge
curving out once more into the blank
depths of space whence it had come
without the star it had planned to
steal out out out-and we knew
at last that we had won

 and the mighty fleet of ships
around us knew from their own tele-

charts they were massing around us
and hanging motionless while beneath
us the palely glowing gigantic dark
star swept on out into the darkness
of trackless space until it hung like a
titanic feeble moon in the heavens
before us retreating farther and
farther from the shining stars of our
galaxy carrying with it the glowing
cities and the hordes of the tentacle-
peoples never to return there in
the bridgeroom with our massed
ships around us we three watched it
go then turned back toward our own
yellow star serene and far and
benignant that yellow star around
which swung our own eight little
worlds and then dal nara flung out
a hand toward it half weeping now

  the sun she cried the sun
the good old sun that we fought for
and saved our siui till the end of
time



it was on a night a week later that
dal nara and i said farewell to
hurus hoi standing on the roof of
that same great building on neptune
from which we had started with our
fifty cruisers weeks before we had
learned in that week how the only
survivor of those cruisers ship 
had managed to shake off the pur-
suing cones in that first fierce attack
and had sped back to the galaxy to
give the alarm of how the mighty
federation fleet had raced through
the galaxy from beyond antares in
answer to that alarm speeding out
toward the approaching dark star
and reaching it just in time to save
our own ship and our sun

  the other events of that week the
honors which had been loaded upon
us i shall not attempt to describe
there was little in the solar system
which we three could not have had
for the asking but hurus hoi was
content to follow the science that wtas
his life-work while dal nara after
the manner of her sex through all the
ages sought a beauty parlor and i
weird tales



asked only to continue with our
cruiser in the service of the federa-
tion fleet the solar system was
home to us would always be home to
us but never i knew would either
of us be able to break away from the
fascination of the great fleets inter-
stellar patrol the flashing from sun
to sun the long silent hours in cosmic
night and siellar glare wte would be
star-rovers she and i until the end

   so now ready to rejoin the fleet i
stood on the great buildings roof the
mighty black bulk of our cruiser be-
hind us and the stupendous canopy
of the galaxys glittering suns over
our heads in the streets below too
were other lights brilliant flares
where thronging crowds still cele-
brated the escape of their worlds
and now hurus hoi was speaking
more moved than ever i had seen him

  if nal jak were here- he

said and we were all silent for a
moment then his hand came out
toward us and silently we wrung it
turning toward the cruisers door

  as it slammed shut behind us we
were ascending to the bridgeroom
and from there we glimpsed now the
great roof dropping away beneath us
as we slanted up from it once more
the dark figure of hurus hoi out-
lined for a moment at its edge against
the lights below then vanishing and
the world beneath us was shrinking
vanishing once more until at last of
all the solar system behind us there
was visible only the single yellow
spark that was our sun

  then about our outward-racing
cruiser was darkness the infinite
voids eternal night-night and the
unchanging glittering hosts of wheel-
ing flaming stars

times till tlie flower-bells oil
ankles seemed to clap their petals
for very joy and her sheer diaph-
anous skirl slood stiffly out whirling
round her like a wheel of white
next with a quick dodging motion
she advanced a step or two re-
ireated and bent almost double in a
profound salaam to the audience

  a second of tableau then with a
long graceful bound she reached the
center of the rug spread on the
dance floor turning to the orchestra
and snapping her lingers impera-
tively a flageolet burst into a strain
of rippling purling minors a zither
hummed and sang accompaniment a
tom-tom seconded with a hollow
thumping rhythm

  llai she cried in gipsy aban-
don ljiii luii inn

  with a slow gliding movement
she began her dance hands and feet
moving subtly in perfect harmony
now she leaned forward till her
cerise bodice seemed barely to clear
the floor now she bent back till it
seemed she could not retain her bal-
ance again her little naked feet
were motionless on the dark carpet
as twin stars reflected in a still pool
while her body swayed and rippled
from ankle to chin like a cobra rear-
ing upright and her arms seemingly
boneless described sinuous serpen-
tine patterns in the air her hands
bent backward till the fingers almost
touched the wrists

  now pipe and zither were stilled
and only the rhum rhum rlmm-
rhum-rhum of the tom-tom spoke
and her torso throbbed and rippled
in the danse du ventre

  the music rose suddenly to a shrill
crescendo and she began to whirl 
her painted toes with a wild fan-
dango movement her arms straight
out from her shoulders as though
nailed to an invisible cross her skirt

flickering horizontally about her like
some great white-petaled flower her
little soft feet making little soft
hissing sounds against the purple
carpet as she spun round and round

  slowly slowly her speed de-
creased she was like a beautiful
top spun at greatest speed gradu-
ally losing its momentum the music
died to a thin plaintive wail the
pipe whimpering softly the zither
crooning sleepily and the tom-toms
rumble growing fainter and fainter
like receding summer thunder

  for a moment she paused dead-
still only her slim breasts moving as
they fought llutteriugly for breath
then in a high sweet soprano she
began an old eastern love song a
languorous beguiling tune of a people
who have made a fine art of love-
making for uncounted generations

for thou beloved art to me
as a garden

even sis a garden of rare and beauteous

   flowers

hoses bloom upon thy lips

and the mountain myrtle
tn thy eyes

tliy breasts are even as the lily

even as the moonflower
who unveils her pale faee nightly
to the passionate caresses of the moon
thy hair is as the tendril of the grape   

  with slow gliding steps she re-
treated toward the archway through
which she had come paused a
moment and held her hands out to
the audience her henna-tipped fingers
curled into little flowerlike cups

  as she halted in her recessional a
great shout went up from one of the
slant-eyed men nearest the dancing-
floor

  in a moment the place was like an
unroofed ant-hill lights shouted

  in the sudden welter of bright
illumination as every light in the
place was snapped on we saw a circle
of the strange people forming and
slowly closing on mutina more than
one of the men stealthily drawing
a wicked-looking malay kris from
beneath his coat

  thrusting both hands beneath her
star-sown veil the girl brought forth
a pair of limes broke their rinds with
frantic haste and sprinkled a circle
of the acid amber juice about her on
the floor

  an evil-eyed man who seemed to be
the leader of the strangers started
backward with a snarl of baffled rage
as she completed the circle and
looked wonderingly about him

  ha my ugly-faced friend you
did not expect that hemf asked
jules de grandin in high good humoi
me i am responsible for it as a
half-breed of your cursed devil-tribe
madame mutina could no more have
touched a lime than she could have
handled a live coal but with the aid
of a christian priest i have freed her
from her curse and now she does

  mutina was like a thing possessed
one was every vestige of western
culture she had picked up during her
residence here she was once more a
woman of the never-changing east
an elemental female creature stark
bare of all conventions glorying in
the battle and the savage part her
man played in it safe inside her
barrier of lime juice she danced up
and down in wild elation as de
grandin and starkweather slowly
advancing across the dancefloor beat
a path toward her smashing arms
and ribs and skulls with the merci-
less flailing of their spiked clubs

   bravely struck o defender of the
fatherless she screamed billahi

from the trance of admiration with
which he had watched de grandin

  like terriers leaping on a pitful of
rats costellos detectives boiled over
the dancing-floor blackjacks pre-
viously well soaked in lime juice
brass knuckles similarly treated and
here and there a big raw fist still wet
with its baptism of acid liquid struck
and hammered against brown faces
and dashed devastating blows into
wicked slanting yellow eyes

more than once that legging of the

who braved the sorrows of a broken
heart and the wrath of the devil-

who says otherwise is a foul liar

to the floor as the pledge was finished

shadows of him who walkswestward

assured them for ever and for

magnificent pearl i had ever seen
large as a small marble it was with
a pigeons-ncck luster and deep opal-
like fire-gleams in its depths which
held the eyes in fascination as a
magic crystal might hold a devotee
enthralled ignorant as i was of such
matters i knew the thing must be
worth at least thirty thousand dollars
perhaps twice that sum

his pistol at boyles head but re-
frained from firing it boyle was an
excellent shot  he knew despite his
nervousness that his bullet had
struck his adversary between the

boot

  spectral and cool came the lament-

  a hand of white glaring bones
stretched out and grasped the little
leathern bag proffered by boyles
outstretched quavering palm

  sire you are at liberty to go but
quickly sire

hurried his ghastly rider away-a
rider who seemed not to stoop before
low-hanging limbs but who stayed in
his saddle as he rode boyle was

  how long he waited there trem-
bling is problematical drawing his
pistol he reloaded it and played nerv-
ously with the hammer ned was
still but a cold sweat covered him
boyle looked again toward the trees
that had startled him they seemed
but trees

  then he spoke softly to ned
heeled him on riding gently his
weapon across his chest

  then he laughed harshly as ned
swung into a trot at last free of that
