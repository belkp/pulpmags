 asteroids and meteoroids

 by t oconor sloane phd

the solar system the central sun
and its planets mercury venus
our earth and the outer planets as
we may term them follow in their move-
ments and have in their relations to each
other some laws which impress us as
curiously simple we might anticipate
them as being quite natural except that
their simplicity surpasses what we know
of mother nature on this little ball of
metal rock water and detritus on which
we live support ourselves or try to and
pretty effectually kill each other to
mussolini is accredited the statement
that war ennobles a nation much that
has occurred in recent years makes one
doubt the accuracy of such a remark if
it is merely a question of killing people
we will find that it is taken excellent
care of by the automobile but no one
thinks that automobile deaths ennobles
the world

bodes law is an impressive example
of an utterly simple relation between the

distances of the planets from the sun
it will be found stated in any good as-
tronomy book by taking a simple
series of numbers starting with  or
unity multiplying each by three and
then adding four to each we get another
series the numbers in which are ap-
proximately proportional to the indi-
vidual distances from the sun of nur
earth and of most of the other planets
jeans notes the interesting fact that
the law was enunciated before the dis-
covery of the planet uranus of the
asteroids and of neptune when these
were discovered uranus and the aste-
roids were found to fit excellently well
into the bode series neptune was obsti-
nate and did not join the group except in
a poor approximation the planet acts up
to the personality of the ancient sea
deity of the greek mythology whom
homer depicts as anything but an in-
teresting or well behaved character

   the name asteroid meaning star-like


amazing stories

is obviously a poor one planetoid is
often used and is better

  in their motions around the sun the
planets have for their path one of the
simplest curves in mathematics-the el-
lipse it is one of the conic sections and
the simplest of all three of them for the
circle is one limit of an ellipse with
both foci in one the line taken as ex-
tending from a planet to the sun is called
its radius sector it follows the plan-
ets which move in ellipses varies in
length and the planets vary in the rate
of their rotation so that their radius
vectors sweep over equal areas as the
planet goes through its elliptical orbit
it will be understood that the radius
vector of a planet always extends from
it to only one focus of the elliptical
orbit and therefore varies constantly in
length

  if we go on with this picturing to
our inner consciousness the simplicity
of some things in our cosmos or solar
system as it is better to call it we will
come to quite a curious thing suppose
we draw all the planets in a straight
row each in relative size and solar dis-
tance we will find if we draw two lines
one above and one below them we shall
have the section of a fusiform or spindle-
shaped solid pointed at or starting at
the sun swelling out to pass the planet
jupiter and coming to a point in distant
space sir james jeans

  in this section there is a gap or
space with a quantity of little planets
planetoids they are properly called aste-
roids is one incorrect name which has
been bestowed upon them these move
through space like the planets each
asteroid in its own orbit around the
sun it is the many asteroids in their
orbits that in stories of interplanetary
travel the space ships are supposed to
dread nearly a thousand have been
identified and there are lots more of
them one theory is that they are the

fragments of an exploded planet whose
orbit lay between little mars and gigan-
tic jupiter these little asteroids are
very well behaved and never come into
collision with the earth the fusiform
solid within which the planets fit fairly
well some far too small for their posi-
tion is taken to suggest a one time fila-
ment of -matter extending out from the
sun and collapsing into the planets of
our system we may wonder whether
the asteroids are spheroids or angular
fragments of metal or rock it would
seem that space-ships could avoid them
by going north or south but as yet
there are no space-ships to try it out

  sometimes what is called a shooting
star is seen to fly across the sky a bril-
liant path marking is course this has
had assigned to it a rather poetical name
of meteor the brilliant light is attrib-
uted to friction with the atmosphere of
our earth it is hard to believe that a
few seconds flight through the air should
heat a rock or a piece of iron alloy to
incandescence or could even cause it to
burst into violent explosion meteors do
glow with incandescence they sometimes
explode like a bombshell-and there is
nothing to make them do it except fric-
tion with the air it implies an almost
inconceivable velocity

  before they are visible they may be
called meteoroids webster unhesitat-
ingly accepts this name with its defini-
tion although the term is little used a
meteor sometimes falls to earth often
bursting into fragments which scatter in
all directions in the middle of last
march a meteor flew over western can-
ada and burst with tremendous violence
shaking houses in central alberta and
frightening the people who rushed out
of their dwellings in alarm it is proposed
to send out a searching party to secure
some of the pieces the authorities in
yale university believe that the fragments
reached the earth not far from new
asteroids and meteoroids



haven connecticut this event cer-
tainly brings the meteor pretty close to
our dbors

  a few years ago there was a fall of
a huge meteorite in siberia most un-
fortunately it was not adequately investi-
gated there is no adequate record of
its fall it is supposed to have devastated
a considerable extent of country other
large meteorites are reported in mexico

  in arizona there is a curious crater-
like depression  feet in diameter
and about  feet deep it lies in a
plain and a wall of rock over  feet
in height surrounds it on its edge this
is attributed to the fall of an enormous
meteorite but the mass has never been
found although it has been searched
for most thoroughly several tons of
meteoric iron alloy have been found in
its vicinity but borings have failed to
reach any great body of metal buried
there

  if the mile-wide canyon with its
hundred foot wall is due to a meteorite
and if the great siberian devastated area
is due to one they would seem to be
very terrifying visitants yet they have
spared human life one which fell
near a laborer in england was the first
step in the path which led to the con-
clusion that they came from outer space
and that shooting stars were meteor-
ites heated to incandescence by friction
with the air the paths of shooting
stars meteors they are properly termed
must lie within the atmosphere if fric-
tion with the air produces their heating
this leads to the conjecture for it is
little more that they become luminous
at a height of some seventy miles the
curious thing about them is that the bril-
liant incandescence affects only a very
thin layer of the surface not over one
twenty-fifth of an inch in depth

  as a museum piece on public exhibi-
tion the largest meteorite is in the
museum of natural history in new

york it was brought by the arctic
explorer robert j peary from green-
land on his trip little has been said
about the effect on his compass of the
k ton mass of meteoric iron the
esquimaux whose intercourse with
whalers and explorers had taught them
the use of iron are said to have used
pieces of the meteorite for making spear
heads or other objects

  the largest iron alloy meteorite which
has been discovered and adequately re-
ported as to dimensions and composition
is in southern africa it is called the
hoba meteorite it lies about twelve
miles west of the town of grootfontein
a settlement of over twelve thousand in-
habitants in s w africa its recorded
discovery is put at about the year 
it was virtually unknown previous to
 this does not say that individuals
may not have seen it

  it is now a national monument and
presumably protected so as to be free
from injury it is but fair to say that it
is so hard that it cannot easily be de-
faced which has operated to protect it
it has been attacked by some unknown
person with a blast-lamp whose action
has left traces on its surface it is
roughly rectangular in its surfaces with-
out projections of any importance as
it lies thirteen people can stand upon its
top or upper surface it is about ten
by nine feet in horizontal area its
greatest thickness in a vertical direc-
tion at one end is  centimeters a
little over four feet at the other end
it is  centimeters or thirty inches thick
taking its specific gravity as  the
weight figures out at nearly eighty tons
before it was incandescent it may have
weighed ten per cent more as it em-
bedded itself in the earth it is sup-
posed to have formed a layer of ferru-
ginous shale which encases it partially
to a thickness of about twelve inches if
this was formed from the meteorite it


amazing stories

provides the nearly ten percent to be
added to its weight it has its own
magnetic polarity

  its analysis gives iron -nickel
 leaving a little over one per cent
to be determined it is so intractable
that it took two days work of two men
to cut off a fragment for analysis

  the planets of the solar system are
approximately spherical-the asteroids
we may assume to be the same-but no
spherical or spheroidal meteorite is on
record the specific gravity of the
earth is approximately that of the iron
meteorites-this gives a foundation for
the belief that its core or central por-
tion is mostly iron

  there are also meteorites of stone
containing comparatively little metallic
iron these naturally do not get into
museums in as large numbers as do the
nickel-iron ones which have a more dis-
tinctive appearance

  the origin of meteors is a profound
secret literally speaking in the depths
of nature we read of the earth col-
liding with a comet but no one knew of
it from any effect produced on account
of the tenuousness of the substance of
the celestial visitor another curious
problem concerns the size of meteors
it is true that we have found upon the
earth a number of them of considerable
dimensions as in the case of the south
african one just noted and of the
peary meteorite yet the belief holds that
there are numbers of very small ones
and if these get heated to a sufficient

extent to a high enough temperature

                                       v

                       o

they will of course seem larger than they
really are the filament of an electric
lamp whose thickness is measured in the
thousandths of an inch seems quite large
when seen across a room and the same
effect undoubtedly obtains in meteors
but there are large ones the south
african one is supposed to weigh about
 tons and if the arizona canyon was
made by one it must have been an
enormous projectile it has occurred to
prospectors that if there were such a
meteor in the arizona crater it would
be a very valuable property and a
number of drillings have been made in
hopes of finding it but so far without
success some fragments were recov-
ered in the drilling and around the site
of the crater bits of the meteor have
been picked up

  of the great siberian meteor compara-
tively little is known because of its dis-
tance in the almost arctic wilderness it
was never investigated except after a long
interval and then it is probably fair to
say inadequately the destruction in the
surrounding forest from its fall was said
to have been felt for many miles and we
cannot but hope that some time in the
future a really adequate investigation will
be made and perhaps the meteorite itself
may be discovered we know that pea-
rys meteorite with its smaller com-
panions rested as far as we know intact
upon the greenland shore but we have
not yet found out why the arizona
meteorite cannot be found and as yet we
do not know what may be the results of
a further search in siberia
   life everlasting

           by david h keller md
           serial in two parts-part one

illustrated by morey

dr keller combines the talent of a writer with the knowledge of an
accomplished physician of long experience in his very deeply specialized
field the present story is most delightfully charged with a kindly view of
human nature on its pathetic side and this first portion will leave the
readers eagerly awaiting the denouement which will appear in our next
number and will be beyond the surmises of our readers but it gives a
wonderful touch of psychology the authors years of study in his field
gives special force and interest to the story

chapter i

four failures meet

sally was sweeping the stairs
when she was not doing that
she was spending her time mak-
ing beds scrubbing pots and
washing windows life in the
cheap boarding house was just making
dirty things clean as far as sally was
concerned

  from her babyhood she had suffered
from poverty and asthma these twin
afflictions had stunted her body and
warped her mind when she was not
conscious of the struggle to breathe
she was keenly aware of the fight to
earn the necessities of life the dual
conflict left her no time for the finer
things of the world fortunately she
was only dimly aware of their existence
days of work with nights of respiratory
anguish dulled her soul till she had
only one pleasant anticipation the
thought of an early death at twenty
she was aged and worn an old woman
who had never been loved since the day
her mother had taken the baby girl in
her arms cried a little and died

as she swept the steps perfumed

youth passed her mary casey she had
been called in shamokin pa but now
as a jitney dancer in the moonland
dance hall she was called valencia
moore her body was formed of curves
and her mentality was slightly above
that of the adenoid moron her par-
ents alternating between love and hate
had procreated her in lust and had
raised her in an environment that would
have mired the whitest lily she grew
up to be unmoral rather than immoral
wanting clothes perfume and a good
time she commercialized her sex ap-
peal by spending her days in bed and
her nights in the arms of anyone who
would pay ten cents for a one-minute
dance

  for six months she had passed sally
the scrub-woman several times a day
without speaking to her sally was
conscious of her only as one of the
pieces of dirt that some day would be
swept out of the house the two girls
had nothing in common except that
anatomically they were both females

  as one girl swept up the steps leav-
ing behind her a cheap perfume and
the other swept down the steps leaving
behind her just dust harry wild crab-
footed down from the third floor back

and passed both of them he had a
hump on his shoulder the size of the
regulation football a right leg that was
four inches shorter than the left leg
a twisted face strabismus and a clear
conscience for years he had made a
good living selling papers and smiling
at his patrons on the street he had
friends from every walk of life in his
room he read books fed mice and
dreamed of a day when some woman
would love him for two years he had
written a daily love letter to sally and
so far had never had the courage to
do anything with them save put them
in his trunk sally knew him adored
his smile hated his mice and kept his
room clean

  the third floor front held the mystery
of the house he was a man with a
steady income and no occupation john
jones was his new york name every
two weeks he received a letter with a
check he was clean bald and old
he spent a little of his income for food
more for clothes and the rest in the
cheap dance halls of new york he
danced one-third of the dances rested
the other two-thirds and never gave a
hostess more than one ticket he hoped
that some night he would find the
woman he was looking for as he
was hunting one with the intelligence
of minerva the body of venus and
the kindness of the mother mary his
quest was doomed to failure so he
danced and twiddled his thumbs and
wished that his heart muscle and his
moral code would allow him to spend
ten dollars on one woman instead of
ten cents each on many he had danced
with valencia moore but he did not
know that she lived on the floor above
him

 jones bought his newspaper from
harry wild and occasionally danced
with valencia moore wild smiled on
the other three and dreamed of loving

sally valencia paid no attention to
any one of them they simply did not
enter her plan of life sally kept things
clean for all of them and fantasied a
life free from dirt and asthma

o	ingle they might have been in-
 teresting to the sociologist as a
quartette they made a harmonic fail-
ure from the animal viewpoint they
shared certain biological urges they
slept ate and moved as necessity de-
manded spiritually there was no con-
tact even had sally known of the let-
ters the newsboy was writing to her
she would have reacted with a con-
fused negativism that any man should
love her was a thought so impossible
that it never entered into her conscious-
ness

  these four were failures and all of
them through no fault of their own
heredity environment disease the in-
hibitions of a false standard of morality
had twisted and warped them mentally
spiritually and physically till they were
caught in a web of fate from which
there was no escape

  the metropolis could have furnished
a hundred thousand fours as badly as-
sorted unharmonic failures as these
in fact there was no reason why they
should have been selected as the ex-
perimental basis for a scientific study
that was destined to change in every
way the life of the human race there
were thirty others living in that board-
ing house any four of whom might
have served equally well but the
scientist selected these four his de-
cision was not exactly a haphazard one
he wanted a beautiful woman who was
bad a good woman sick and soulless a
gentleman whose body was shattered
and an old man who was trying to be
young

  the scientist found what he wanted
in these four failures

chapter ii

the initial experiment

harry ackerman had some-
thing but he was not sure of
what to do with it for five
years he had used the serum on the
lower mammalia had checked re-
checked and double checked his results
yet continued to doubt his own observa-
tions no matter what animal he used
for his experiment the results were
the same

  his results were so uniform the
method so simple the final analysis so
weird and unusual that he simply could
not believe what he saw it was im-
possible to confide in any of his brother
scientists they would have considered
him insane he refused either to be
laughed at or to spend the rest of his
life behind the walls of a hospital for
psychotics in addition to this he
wanted to have the sole credit for his
discovery and that selfishness made him
become an antisocial hermit it was
not a question of selling his brain-child
he neither needed nor wanted money
but he did want recognition leading to
fame

  now at the end of five years he
was ready to begin human experimenta-
tion that after all was to be the
crowning effort of his years of work
he felt that he knew what he could
do with the body but when it came
to the mind he was not so sure it
was difficult to imagine the results prop-
erly  it was impossible to determine
the size or the number of the doses it
was one thing to feed the panacea to
crickets or mice and another thing to
inject it into the veins of a man too
little would be tantalizing too much
dangerous he could not keep his sub-
jects in cages as he did the little
monkeys

  yet he realized that sooner or later
he had to face the issue it would not
take him more than one minute to in-
ject five cubic centimeters into a hu-
man vein once that was done all he
would have to do would be to wait for
the results if he failed why other
men had failed before if he succeeded
life would be changed not just one
life but the life of the genus homo

  for the present the last thing he
wanted was newspaper publicity a
cleverly worded advertisement would
have given him experimental material
by the hundreds but it would also have
brought unpleasant notoriety just now
he had to work in secret that is why
he came to new york where a man
can be lost more quickly and more
completely than he can in the sahara
desert

  at times he had contemplated giving
himself an injection of the serum that
would have been the easiest way and
the simplest but he was not sure of
the results and he could not face the
thoughts of an accident not on his own
account but for the sake of his son
the last ten years of his life had been
spent for the good of the boy other-
wise he would not have had the cour-
age or the vision to go on with the
work if he took the serum and died
as some of the animals had died in
the early years of his study there would
be no one left to love the little fellow
and though he rarely saw him he felt
that love was very essential for the
welfare of harry ackerman jr

  there was no special method in his
selection of a boarding house when he
came to new york he simply picked
out a cheap one in a poor neighbor-
hood paid a months rent in advance
and started to become acquainted with
his fellow boarders from those he
met he selected the four failures and
much to their surprise he asked them
life everlasting



to spend a saturday evening with him
the hard part of the program was
persuading them to accept his invitation
each required a different approach and
with the exception of harry wild none
of them would have come had he known
the others were to be there

  sally came because the landlady or-
dered her to be nice to a star boarder
john jones came because it was the
first time anyone had been kind to him
in new york without charging him for
it valencia saw a chance to do some
fancy gold-digging and besides a
twisted ankle kept her from the dance
hall but harry wild had found a
man who knew more about mice than
he did and that was enough for him

of the five at the party only the
scientist was at his ease sally
was breathing hard and wondering how
soon she would become a dope-fiend
adrenalin did not help her much now-
adays but morphine made the hell of
breathless life a heaven of comfort in
fifteen minutes wild kept thinking of
those love letters never sent and won-
dering if sally was looking at the
rogers group or at his twisted spine
the dancering temptation could not
understand why the guy had asked the
rest of the crowd when she could have
given him seventy minutes of pleasure
for every hour he was willing to pay
for the old man could not keep his
eyes off of her curves but he knew
that his myocardium could not stand
the strain and besides her english
was impossible

  ackerman turned on the radio passed
the candy cake and cigarettes and tried
to be the perfect host socially he was
a failure the party was nothing more or
less than five incompatibles meeting in
a test tube he shut off the radio just
as the quarrelsome quartet gave place
to the malted brew advertising

  i want to talk to you people he
began and i am going to try to be
as brief and as plain as i can there
is a serum i have been working on for
some time a medicine you understand
in some ways i am a physician and i
have tried to discover something that
would help people to get well it is
something new and i am not sure how
much good it will do but i am sure
that it will not hurt the people i give
it to i am not in regular practice so
i cannot give it to my patients that
is why i have asked you here to-night
i believe that it will help miss sally
fannings asthma that it will improve
mr jones heart trouble and that it
will make a different man out of my
friend harry wild

  what do t get it for old nut
asked valencia moore

  you get it for anaemia of your
pocketbook in other words it means
just one hundred dollars to you to take
one dose

  at-a-boy she laughed now you
are talking my language for a hun-
dred bucks i would take a dose of any
poison give it to me quick

  sally fanning breathing harder than
usual looked at the dancing fool and
then at the stranger and then she
gasped

  i do not understand you mr acker-
man do you really mean that you be-
lieve you can cure my asthma and
if you can will the same medicine help
mr jones perhaps it will but what
has that to do with miss moore or
mr wild they are not sick

  it is hard to explain to you miss
fanning answered the scientist and
there was a tone of patient kindness in
his voice the serum i am going to
use is a most peculiar one it has or at
least-  think it has many different
kinds of actions there are different
kinds of sicknesses you know and i

hope that all of you will be benefited
by the injection i am not promising
anything definite but i honestly feel
that it will help everyone of you and
i am sure that it will not hurt you
when i told miss moore i would give
her a hundred dollars i really should
have said that i am going to give each
of you that amount because you are
all helping me in a study that is very
important to my future if you are
ready i will begin perhaps first on
mr wild he knows me better and
trusts me more than the rest of you
will you take off your coat and roll
up your sleeve on the right side mr
wild there that will do very well
now you all watch me first the
tourniquet then the needle goes into
the vein and i slowly inject the serum
it really does not hurt at all who
will be the next one

  i will announced valencia but
first give me my hundred

chapter iii
the first results



ood morning miss fan-
ning how is the asthma
sally the scrub looked up
from the brown stone steps she was
cleaning ackerman was smiling down
at her

  your medicine helped me she an-
swered simply all my life i have
taken green mountain asthma cure
and lately adrenalin and even morphine
and everything else that anyone ad-
vised they all helped for a while and
then i was as bad off as ever of
course having to work for a living
made it hard for me perhaps your
medicine is the same as the rest good
to-day and no good to-morrow but it
certainly helped me to sleep and this
morning i feel strong and rested if

i felt this way all the time i might
amount to something might have cour-
age to try doing something different
might even go to night school and get
an education i read in the paper
once that even if a woman was ugly it
helped if she knew something

  but you are not ugly

  she laughed bitterly

 you must be blind look at my
neck and my hands my hair dead
every bit of me work all day to earn
an honest meal and a decent bed and
then work all night for the right to
keep alive every breath a battle how
could a woman be anything but ugly
but you are going to be better
suppose i tell you that in a little while
you would be well that your body
would grow beautiful your hair radiant
how would you like to sing as you
work to have people tell you your
voice was lovely your soul a thing of
charm  what would you do then
sally fanning

 i would cry mr ackerman i
would be so happy i would cry for the
joy of it i would brush my hair till
it came alive and wash myself and put
on clean clothes and go and sit in the
park in the sunshine and just breathe
deep it is a terrible thing to fight for
every breath as i have had to do all
my life i used to dream of being a
bird flying high in the sky yet having
enough air left in me to sing but al-
ways would come the waking and the
asthma

  perhaps the dream will come true
replied the scientist have you seen
my friend harry wild this morning
i always see him in the morning
we always see each other in the early
of the dawn we are the first up and
out he to sell his papers and i to do
my cleaning

  how did he feel

  he was smiling
life everlasting



  but he always smiles

  yes that he does but this morning
he said he felt better you know he
has trouble with his back never speaks
much about it but the pain is there
where the hump is this morning he
said it was gone of course he meant
the pain there is nothing can untwist
the body of him i guess he smiles to
help forget his legs and his back

  i like him said ackerman quietly
he is kind to the mice

  they come to him explained sally
wherever he is the mice gather they
used to be all over the house and now
they all live in his room of course
he feeds them but there is something
more than that

  do you suppose they know he loves
them asked ackerman

  the girl frowned

  if i dont get to work on these
steps they will never be cleaned but
i will say this about mr wild he is
a nice young man as nice a young man
as i ever cleaned after and there would
be more than mice loving him if his
back were straight and his legs even
but he was born that way and cannot
help it any more than i can help my
having asthma

  but suppose that would all be cor-
rected i mean suppose he would get
well and be like other men

  suppose you go and ask him his
stand is just around the corner sup-
pose you stop talking to me about the
moon and heaven and singing birds that
never waken you know and i know
that just as he is now so he will be
till they place pennies on his eyes

i am not so sure of that retorted
the scientist at least i will go and
buy a morning paper from the lad
harry wild was singing as he handed
the lurid sheets to his regular customers

  there was little in the papers that was
worth singing about

appy asked ackerman

  you said it no pain slept
all night and woke as fine as could be
turned on the radio and took my exer-
cises one two three four great
stuff old twenty-three used to be
hard to do but this morning everything
was easy

  he lowered his voice

did you see sally this morning 
i did and she was breathing with
the ease of an opera singer she is a
nice girl harry only she lets herself
be discouraged

  it would be fine if things were
different mr ackerman just suppose
that she didnt have asthma and sup-
pose i was like other men big and
strong and easy walking just sup-
pose that say that would be great
stuff wouldnt it

  you are going to be harry first
the pain will leave you and then your
short leg will get longer and your
back straight and even the mice wont
know you any more

  quit your kidding still it sounds
nice think there is a chance that the
girl will get over her asthma
ackerman took a deep breath

  you are all going to get well he
whispered all four of you strong
and well and sane and good you are
going to be the first of a new race it
is too soon for me to be sure and too
wonderful for me to see clearly but if
that medicine works harry you will
soon be able to love something else
than just mice

  quit your kidding blushed the
boy but it would be nice mr acker-
man it would be nice

fn the next twenty-four hours the
inventor saw and talked to the other
two of his experiments he visited
john jones in his room and found a
puzzled man eager to be questioned


amazing stories

  two years ago he began the
doctors told me i might die at any
moment so i came to new york
they said that i would die on my feet
and i made up my mind that  would
learn to dance and die with a pretty
girl in my arms after you gave me
the serum i went to sleep it was the
first night i missed going to a jitney
dance hall this morning things look
different i know now that i am not
going to die that way in fact i feel
so well that i am not sure i am ever
going to die

  that is an interesting statement
said ackerman suppose you kept on
living and growing stronger and
younger what would you do how
would you pass your time

  i would write all my life i have
wanted to write there is nothing as
fine as putting a piece of white paper
in a machine and pounding out your
thoughts on it but for years i was
too busy had to make a living lots of
people depended on me for the necessi-
ties of life i had lots of things to
write about but never any time and
when i did have the time the strength
was lacking then my heart went bad
after influenza the doctors tried to
be kind and lied to me at first they
called it post-influenzal asthenia later
they told me the truth

  so you tried to kill yourself danc-
ing

  no i tried to die while dancing
but it was not the dancing i was after
i wanted love and no one is going to
love an old broken man so i took
the best substitute but not one of
them gave me rest did you ever hear
the girls talk in a dance hall mr
ackerman it is just too bad i think
everyone of them is feebleminded and
all they are after is a mans money if
a skeleton was worth a million they
would pretend to get hot rubbing the

wire that held his bones together just
one night was enough for me to find
that out i told my first partner that
i was enough of a healthy vulgarian to
enjoy holding a pretty woman in my
arms for ten minutes they fought
with each other for the next dance 
finally asked one of them what they
were excited about and she said that
the first girl had spread the news that
i was a wealthy bulgarian of course
they had never heard of the vulgate
bible

  what do you think of miss moore

  she is as pretty as can be and as
soiled as man can make her if she
were disinfected and educated and had
the evil burned out of her and if 
were young i think i could love her
and be happy

  have you seen her this morning

  yes 

  how is she feeling

  said her ankle was o k she
must be worried because she forgot to
paint her face she does not know it
but she is prettier without her make-
up

  i think she is going to change com-
mented the inventor

chapter iv
the experts opinion

  ackerman waited for three weeks
h and then decided that it was time
to check up on the results of the
serum before giving the four injec-
tions he had anticipated waiting at
least six months but two things had
happened to make him change his mind

  in the first place harry wild had a
number of friends not the kind to
invite him to dinner with them but
interested enough to go out of their way
and buy papers from him and slip him
a fiver at christmas some of them
life everlasting



had known him for years from the
time he had been a ragged but smiling
street urchin they noticed the change
in him variations in the health and
conduct of the other three might have
gone and come without any ones know-
ing or caring but with the crippled
man on the corner it was different
men talked to him and he did not hesi-
tate to talk back to them one man
believed

  that night harry ackerman had a
visitor in fact three a man a
woman and a little child the man lost
no time in stating his business he
was the kind of man who had made
his millions in wall street by taking
an opportunity more quickly than the
others his name was hiram smith
and the woman was his wife

  and this is our son he continued
our only son does that mean any-
thing to you

  it does said the inventor i have
an only child and he-well at any rate
i know what you are thinking of

  good this little boy is bright
nothing wrong with his mind but he
cannot walk he cannot even feed him-
self he was born that way can
you cure him

  i am not a physician

  no but you are the man who
helped harry wild i have known him
for years financed his first news-
stand he knows about my boy and
he told me about you during the last
week i have had harry to see three
specialists they have examined him
in every way known to the medical
world they took a series of x-rays
of his back and legs they do not un-
derstand what happened but they say
that in a few more weeks he will be a
perfect man in every way now the
boy says you did it did you can
you do the same thing for this boy of
mine if you can i will give you one

million dollars and i am not saying
what  will do if you can and refuse

  there are other boys and girls in
the world whispered the inventor
your boy is not the only one who is
not normal

  the woman carried the boy over and
gave him to his father then she went
over knelt beside ackerman and looked
up at him in her youth she had been
a beautiful woman

t am not threatening you she said
and i am not bribing you with a
million but i am telling you this 
can never have another child my hus-
band loves me but he says that he
must have a son who can carry on the
family tradition that means another
woman in his life  have a son make
him well do it for the sake of your
wife

  my wife is dead said the man
take his coat off and roll up his sleeve
the right one

  he prepared a dose of the serum and
injected it into the boys vein

  i am promising nothing he cau-
tioned but i am asking two favors
first i do not want any publicity
second there are three other people
who have had the serum besides the
newsboy they live in this house i
will give you their names i want you
to take them to these specialists and
have them examined i also want their
intelligence determined their morals
their viewpoint on life i want an
analysis made of their digestion the
number of calories it takes per day to
keep them in health when they are
finished bring me the four reports it
might be interesting to have your son
examined now again in a week and a
third time at the end of a month i

star sob reporter of the purple flash
new yorks latest and most startling
tabloid

  i am asking for an interview mr
ackerman when any worthwhile events
take place in this city the purple flash
gets the news first who are you
what are you doing in the city what
kind of serum do you use what did
you do to valencia moore who used to
be mary casey of shamokin and who
for many months has had the reputation
of being the worst taxi girl in the dives of
the city what did you do to her and
how did you do it

 did i do anything wrong to the
young lady parried ackerman

 no that is just it i heard a
rumor that there was something big
going on so we looked up her record

that girl has been bad enough to satisfy
the cravings of a dozen girls and sev-
eral thousand men she has not been
satisfied to burn the candle of life at
both ends but has turned herself into
a pinwheel of fireworks she was dis-
eased in every way morally spiritually
and physically in one more year she
would have rested quiet on a marble
slab at the morgue now she is quite
different in every way her talk her
thoughts her life she does not even
paint anymore and ill tell the world
that she is o k without it one of
the most beautiful dames i ever saw
and dont forget that the men all know
it and what does she tell them if
you want me to think kindly about you
go and make someone happy polly-
anna stuff i have seen her and she
talks freely to use a good wrord of
the psychologists she has insight she
knows she has changed and she gives
you the credit says that one night
you gave her a hundred dollars and a
shot in the arm and since then she has
been different

ackerman changed her but could
not take the eternal feminine out of
her listen to me ackerman is not

  no said the inventor returning to
his packing

  the reporter looked at him and she
smiled

  you are probably a wise man she
commented but you do not know very
much about newspapers and nothing at
all about the purple flash we are
like the canadian mounted police we
always get our man it the news you
represent is as important as i think it
is we will get it as far as the times
is concerned i used to work for it
the flash tripled my salary to get me
now will you tell me what i want to
know

  no it is a two-letter word begin-
ning with an n and ending with an
o and it means negation use it in
your crossword puzzle and let me finish
packing

  did you or did you not on the
night of the third give a dose of serum
to four people

  i did i told you that i told you
their names and the fact that they lived
in this house

 what was the serum what was
it supposed to do to them

  i have no answer

  did you just before i came in give
a dose of the same serum to a little boy
carried by hiram smith the wolf of
wau street

  i have no answer

 let me tell you something two
days after you gave harry wild his
serum the purple flash knew about it
we paid him to keep quiet at least
as far as reporters are concerned we
have had six men on the case ever since
we know all about the fanning girl
and her asthma and john jones and his
cardiac trouble we have made an
independent x-ray examination of
harrv wild in the office there are
over twenty thousand words ready for
release we know that the newsboy

told hiram smith and that smith had
him examined we know about smiths
son and here is something to make
you smile we know who you are
dont ask how none of your friends
betrayed you but you left a trail that
was easy to track

ive of the greatest scientists in the
united states have been under the
employ of the purple flhsh for the
last week studying the four people you
gave the injections to it is their opin-
ion that if you have a serum that will
work on them you have something
that will revolutionize the entire social
and economic status of the human race
we are not interested in the first four
except in regard to their relation to the
next four million or four hundred mil-
lion if you have what they think you
have it is too great a secret for one
man to hold it should belong to the
nation in fact one of the men said it
should belong to the world

  suppose you should die  or develop
insanity dont you see what a priceless
secret would die with you and how
are you going to use it what price
are you going to ask for it are you
going to give it free as the man who
discovered insulin did  what will it do
besides cure asthma heart disease and
make twisted bones straight will it
cliange the personality make bad people
good 

  ackerman shook his head

  i do not know that is one of the
things that i came to new york to find
out about but you people are making
it too uncomfortable for me i hate
publicity it never occurred to me that
any paper especially one like yours
would go into a mystery so thoroughly
why did you do it

the first interview but not now not till
i am sure

       chapter v
       the recidivists

sidney biddle alias harry
ackerman went back to his
laboratory and worked and waited
for two weeks at the end of that time
he received the reports promised by
hiram smith in addition there were
several preliminary reports concerning
the smith boy it was all very interest-
ing and made biddle feel that he had
every reason to be confident in his dis-
covery

  but he was too much of a scientist to
be a gambler he knew that the experi-
ment had to be repeated a hundred a
thousand even a million times before
the results could be taken as definite and
conclusive yet he was sure that the
time had come for work on a large scale
he went to see the governor of ohio
a man who was so devoted to the inter-
ests of his people that he was lovingly
called welfare watkins the execu-
tive listened for over an hour without
interrupting and then he said

  i suppose you have had sufficient
vision into this matter to understand
what it means to the nation if you are
correct 

  i think so

  it must be thought over very care-
fully the consequences are so revolu-
tionary that i am afraid i shall not
sleep to night for thinking of them do
you realize that with one step you are
going to wipe out the employment of

large masses of our citizens some of
these groups have carried on an honor-
able existence for centuries they will
no longer be needed of course taxes
will be lowered at once but unemploy-
ment will be increased it is a complex
subject perhaps we had better wait till
your experiments show that you are
absolutely correct of course i will give
you permission to go to our prison in
fact i will go with you the warden is
a fine fellow but he has been a pen-
ologist so many years that at times i
am afraid he has ceased to remain a
humanitarian a personal command
from me will be better than a letter
have you enough of the medicine with
you 

  yes seven hundred doses i under-
stand that the prison population is
slightly over fourteen hundred i wanted
to hold half of them as control cases

  we will go at once i will tell my
secretary to announce that i have left
the state for washington we will make
the trip to farview in my personal air-
plane

  two hours later a group of men sat
in the wardens office at farview it
was composed of the governor the in-
ventor the warden the prison phy-
sician and the prison chaplain the
governor introduced sidney biddle as a
scientist who wished to make an experi-
ment on the prison population he ended
by asking the warden to make a state-
ment concerning his charges

  farview was built the warden re-
plied to take care of the criminal who
could not be reformed there are four-
teen hundred and thirty here at present
and we have room for twenty more it is
the only prison in america that is not
overcrowded the men average twenty-
four years of age a population of mere
boys every one has had at least four
convictions for felony or worse and
not a man here is up for less than
life everlasting



twenty years sixty-five percent are here
for life they have committed every
crime known to the criminal records of
mankind some of their crimes are ab-
solutely new you see that with the ad-
vent of the machine and the electrical
age new ways of being bad developed
and that gave my boys an advantage
even over nero so far we have never
had a riot we may have one the next
hour

ow is their health doctor yard-
ly asked biddle

  as good and as bad as would be ex-
pected syphilis epilepsy tuberculosis
build up the death rate a lot of them
are insane or near it you see they
have no hope and that makes it hard for
them to want to live we try to make
their life worth while give them sports
and talkies but i guess that only adds
to the mental irritation of their hope-
lessness

  their mental attitude is difficult to
combat interrupted the chaplain you
see mr biddle they have been so pois-
oned by their past life that many of
them have not only lost hope in the
present but also in the future a large
number of them do not believe in a
god

  the governor frowned

  in a way i do not blame them are
your records up to date do you know
jour men warden

  i think so

  then pick out seven hundred for
mr biddle i suppose the mere giving
of that many intravenous injections will
not take long but at the same time i
think we had better call on the depart-
ment oi health for a few physicians to
help i am going to send in thirty-six
men they ought to be here to-morrow
take care of them i will have a sten-
ographer for each man one of my pri-
vate secretaries will be here to organize

the office force and help with the records
let me see i want twelve physicians
twelve psychiatrists six lawyers three
hard-headed business men and three of
the clergy from different denominations
get me the department of health on
the phone also the state university do
we need anyone else mr biddle
there should be some psychologists
though most of that fraternity are so
technical that i am afraid they will
block the work and there should be
someone to take charge

  i am going to do that replied the
governor

  welfare watkins said the war-
den with a smile

tll take that for what it is worth

    warden retorted the governor
and it may be that it is not very much
i am the governor of this state and the
people trust me this experiment of
mr biddles is too important for me to
ignore i will spend most of the month
with you as your guest will you stay
mr biddle

  no not after the seven hundred
doses are given i do not want to in-
fluence the findings of your experts in
any way all i want is a written opinion
from you personally at the end of the
month

  the warden frowned

  just what do you expect mr
biddle he asked

  i will answer that question for him
interrupted the governor he has
talked this over with me and we are
not going to tell anyone what he does
expect as far as you know it is simply
a new treatment for ringworm of the
feet what we are going to do is to have
a short concise record of these men
now and a month after they have their
injection there will be a statement
concerning each prisoner complete but
concise if a man is blind i want a


amazing stories

short non-technical statement as to
why he is blind and the condition of his
eyes at the end of thirty days all you
have to do warden is to run this prison
as you always have and furnish every
possible help to these specialists

  i shall have to have more guards the
prisoners wont understand it and
whenever anything happens which they
do not understand they get ugly i
ought to have at least fifty additional
men

  o k agreed the governor you
understand their psychology better than
i do now suppose we get busy i want
to go over your files with mr biddle
there are some of these prisoners i
am interested in and i want to get all
of them on the list

  after three days of hard work sidney
biddle left the prison his part of the
work was done there was nothing to
do but to wait for the results

chapter vi

hiram smiths boy

biddle went from ohio back to
new york he wanted to see the
newsboy and sally the scrub but
changed his mind at the last moment
and went right down into wall street
to the office of hiram smith there he
was met by the usual obstacles confront-
ing anyone who wants to see without
appointment one of the financial over-
lords of america

  your name please and your busi-
ness have you an appointment per-
haps you had better fill out this card
purred the manicured and marcelled doll
at the outer barricade

  the inventor smiled and wrote on
the card

  you owe me something but after all
not publicity how is juniort i should
like to see him ackerman

  see what happens he advised  the
doll better rush it through

  in less than a minute the wolf him-
self came out barking

  in less than another minute the two
men were in the most private of all the
private offices in the building

  well asked the inventor

  i should say so laughed the wolf
you would not believe me but the boy
is actually walking and using his hands
of course the specialists say that the
impossible is happening but suppose it
is what difference does it make so
long as it happens it is my opinion
though of course i am not a doctor that
in another two weeks he will be just as
good as the average boy of his age and
you ought to see the wife she is ten
years younger wait till she sees you
talk about a woman worshipping a man
i have had lots of cause for jealousy
can you come out to the house i hope
you did not register at a hotel but if
you did it makes no difference you
can stay nowhere but with me

  you seem to be excited over it
laughed the scientist

   after all he is my boy think of the
mess i was in only son a hopeless
cripple finest woman in the world my
wife and actually thinking of divorcing
her and marrying some other woman
just so i could have a real man-child
and then you come along and make a
healthy robust lad out of a twisted mon-
strosity of course i am excited the
last time i had him tested the psy-
chologist told me the lad had an intelli-
gence quotient of one hundred and
thirty-five and you ought to see him
run jump and learn to swim come on
and lets go no more work for me to-
day

  the two men went aboard the private
speed boat that was the pride of the
wolf and which he used on his daily
trips to the city thirty minutes up the
life everlasting



hudson and they arrived at a wharf
from it they walked to the house it
was a revolutionary relic hidden in a
forest of oaks nearing the lawn they
saw a man a woman and a boy playing
ball the boy recognuing smith came
running

 thats him explained the wolf
look at those legs no wonder the
orthopaedic surgeons were flabber-
gasted

  looks like a real boy to me ex-
claimed biddle

  by this time the adults had caught up
with the boy biddle looked at them he
felt he ought to know them but some-
how he could not identify them the
man smiled and then he knew him

  harry wild and can this be miss
fanning

  call me sally cried the woman
biddle looked at the woman a won-
derful woman beautiful radiant glow-
ing with health vitality happiness he
looked at the man as fine a man as any
male would want to be

  are you really harry and sally
he asked

  none other laughed the wolf
they are living out here with us
they meant too much to me to let
them stay in the city the other two are
here also

  and we are all well cried sally
well in every way agreed harry
and the kid is doing fine we are
teaching him everything

  you teaching him asked the in-
ventor doubting his ears

  we are indeed you see something
happened to our minds as well as our
bodies of course harry and mr jones
knew a lot to start with but valencia
and i never had much of a chance to
learn so we are just reading all we
can and it is no trouble at all to re-
member everything we read you would

be surprised if you knew just what the
four of us are doing for you

it was not till after nine oclock that
the wolf and the inventor were able
to have an hour to themselves every-
body was happy and excited mrs smith
cried but they all understood why they
all talked during dinner all except
biddle he just sat and listened and
looked he tried to remember the night
he had invited these four to his bedroom
and explained to them what he wanted
were these four the same four jones
did not look a day over thirty wild
could have held his own as guard on a
football team sally was lovely and
valencia charming and they were both
as fine young women as you could see
anywhere sally always had been won-
derful but valencia was now gold with
all the dross burned out

  in the library the wolf turned and
faced his guest

  you have something he said what
are you going to do with it he de-
manded

  biddle threw out his hands in a hope-
less gesture

  i am not sure he replied

  you know what this means

  partly i have just come from ohio
you have heard of the governor wel-
fare watkins he was good to me i
have just finished the injection of seven
hundred recidivists a group of men
who would be considered hopeless by
every known method of analysis wat-
kins is in personal charge of the experi-
ment i am simply waiting till i see the
results

  suppose the sick ones get well and
those who are bad become good  what
are you going to do about it 

  what is there to do  what will
watkins do seven hundred sick men
imprisoned for life become well in every-
way what is the answer


amazing stories

  my answer is this if you can do it
for seven hundred you can do it for
every criminal in the states if you can
do what you did for my boy you can
do it for every little child who needs
it if you can cure sally and harry and
valencia and jones you can cure every-
one who is sick that is my answer can
you are you going to and how
what kind of machinery will you place
in operation you are going to change
humanity before you do it you must
be sure of your control

  biddle walked silently up and down
the book-lined room

  i am going to wait he said at last
till i have the monthly report from
farview prison if that is favorable
i am going to give a guarded statement
to the press

  what paper

  the purple flash

  you are true to your promise
  how do you know 

  i ought to know i am the owner of
the paper my reporter told me what
you had promised her we are just
waiting for your word and then we are
going to have the greatest story any
tabloid has every sprung by the way
do you know what those four patients
of yours are doing they are writing
a book trying to imagine what the
world would be like if everyone was
given a dose of your medicine i am
working on it with them at night i give
them ideas concerning business of
course so far it is only a dream
yes just a dream

  the two men sat in silence suddenly
the wolf whispered

  have you given yourself a dose of
the serum biddle

  no

  wrhy not

  you see i have a boy that is what
i have had in mind all these years i
wanted to do something for him some

day and it did not seem fair to let him
go last

  he-is sick like my boy
  worse

  and you were willing to help my boy

first

  yes you see i had to be sure i
could fail with others and keep work-
ing have hope but if i gave it to the
boy and failed i would have to stop

   understand well you cannot
stop you have something that is
so wonderful that it does not belong to
you understand i am not asking for
anything for myself i could sell that
stuff for you at a million dollars a dose
serum you have been giving away to
diseased convicts but i am not doing
that i am not even asking for a dose
for myself you gave me a real son and
i am yours to command for the rest
of my life but you have something in
that serum that is dynamite if it goes
off at the wrong time it will devastate
the world and if it does not go off it
will rob the world of something the
human race has a right to suppose you
were killed 	

  who is going to kill me

  the doctors and the lawyers ought
to but i suppose you are safe from
them they rank rather high there are
business men who are going to be
wiped out but i doubt if they would
try to kill you but how about the boot-
leggers and the underworld those who
traffic in vice of every form i have
talked to valencia she knows all about
that life but now she is clean clean as
a hounds tooth she says she deserves
no credit for her reformation she just
decided suddenly that she did not want
to be bad anymore the criminal lawyers
may smile when their living is taken
away from them but how about the
criminals and i am not sure of the
life everlasting



politicians they fatten on vice it is a
source of their power

  lets wait answered biddle i
want to be sure of myself and then i
will have a message for the american
people

  will they be ready for it

  that is a point well taken would
it be best to take them into my con-
fidence or to wait till the number of cures
was so great that no one could doubt
you cannot keep it a secret de-
clared the wolf with a twisted smile
my reporters who have been trying
to cover the work in ohio tell me that
there are two hundred reporters at the
farview prison if the governor had not
quarantined the place and called out the
national guard they would have broken
into jail to find out what was going on
so far they cannot say anything be-
cause they do not know anything but
when the governor of a state goes into
a prison for one month with a large staff
of specialists thats news my son thats
news and those reporters are going to
do everything possible to find out what
is going on

  i guess we will let welfare watkins
take care of that

  hiram smith went to the phone and
called up the night editor of the purple
flash after listening carefully he
said

  watkins has told the newspapers that
he has nothing to say

chapter vii

the hunger strike

sidney biddle decided to stay
on as the guest of the wolf of
wall street he wanted to think
some of the questions hiram smith had
asked were enough to make anyone
think biddle was a scientist not a soc-

iologist an inventor not a financier
when he started his studies on a serum
that would help mankind he was think-
ing in terms of his son rather than in
terms of the nation his experiments up
to this time had been devoted only to
making sure of his discovery rather
than to help the human race in its toil-
some staggerings towards the stars the
thought that it would revolutionize the
life of the world was something new
to him he decided that he had to
think it over

  his position in relation to his dis-
covery was not unique the first man
to tame fire tubal cain hammering the
first piece of red hot iron the discoverer
of gunpowder of movable type of the
telescope newton with his apple
watts with his steam kettle morse
with his telegraph wright with his
gliding machine none of these had a
clear consciousness of what his discov-
ery would do to the life of the world
but those who were benefited knew the
man warmed and protected by fire by
the iron tipped rod the man reading
the first bible looking at the moon
through two lenses riding on a train
sending messages first over wire and
then without wire the man chasing
birds through the air these men knew
what the discovery meant sally fan-
ning breathing lustily harry wild
standing erect valencia moore cleansed
from the desire to sin john jones made
young again the crippled son of the
wolf chasing rabbits through the
woods these had a far clearer vision of
what had to happen in the world through
the use of the serum than that of the
man who had spent years perfecting it
and hiram smith sensitized through
years on the stock exchange knew per-
fectly well what stocks would boom and
what stocks would break when wall
street heard the news already he had
sold all of his holdings in the united


amazing stories

drug company a ten million dollar con-
cern he had helped organize

  biddle wired his address to the gov-
ernor of ohio and spent the next
week in long conversations with the
guests of hiram smith he was especial-
ly interested in talking to mrs smith
she was a woman college-educated club-
cultured and devoted through the ill-
ness of her son to charities for children
of under-priviledged children in her joy
over the changed condition of her only
child she could not forget that there
were other children who were warped
twisted and bent she could not forget
them and she could not let the inventor
forget he listened to her pleading he
looked at the pictures of the little lads
and lassies in the homes for the uncur-
ables she was interested in

  you are a peculiar inventor she
exclaimed most of the breed i have
met have made things out of metals or
devised new uses for electricity but you
work with living things and so far you
have not uttered a word or mentioned in
any way the financial side of your un-
dertaking what are you doing it for
what are you going to gain from the
development of your secret serum

  biddle simply smiled

  i have a son he replied i invented
several processes and sold them now
i am spending that money what is
money anyway  what thing that is
worth while can it buy for you what
good did your husbands wealth do you
in the end the thing you were willing
to pay millions for was given to you
like the sunshine like the air you
breathe

  are you going to let the world enjoy
it

  i do not knowr just now i am in-
terested only in my son

on the evening of the eighth day of
his visit he received a telegram

from the governor of ohio urging him
to return to farview prison as soon as
possible no explanation was given he
showed the letter to hiram smith who
simply asked him for permission to take
him to the prison by airplane

  something big must be happening
there and i want to go along and see
what it is he explained you know i
am interested

  the governor might have something
to say about your entering the prison
he might agreed the wolf if he
knew who  was but you can simply in-
troduce me as your secretary or a
fellow-scientist or even your valet

  o k agreed biddle lets start
morning found them at the prison
it was closely guarded by several com-
panies of the national guard the few
hotels of the neighboring town over-
flowed with newspaper men who were
rapidly going insane over their inability
to find out what was happening behind
the mammoth granite walls of the prison
biddle once he was identified had no
trouble in entering and the wolf went
with him as his private secretary

  whats wrong the scientist asked
wtelfare watkins as they met in the
wardens office has the serum failed
the tired executive shook his head
on the contrary it has succeeded too
well the change in the seven hundred
who received the injection has been
rapid and in every way satisfactory
especially so to the men who were
treated men who were almost dead from
tuberculosis started to recover syphili-
tics cleared mentally as well as physi-
cally every man developed a new view-
point on life they started to sing
whistle laugh the utterly vicious and
hopelessly desperate changed almost
overnight

  the representative of the national
committee of mental hygiene told me
that he had never seen anything like
life everlasting



the difference between the men before
and -after the serum the specialists
spent half their time saying that such
changes could not happen to the human
body and the other half finding new
causes for astonishment

  that part of it is all right the
serum has started to act in exactly the
way you said it would not a single
failure but the news spread to the other
half of the prison population how
dont ask me but in a few days the
other seven hundred knew that some-
thing great and wonderful was happen-
ing to their mates and not happening to
them and they did not like it and in a
way i do not blame them suppose you
were in the hospital of the prison rot-
ting to death and in the next bed was
a man as sick as you were and from the
same disease  suppose you saw that man
recover almost over night and you just
kept on dying what if you remained
hopeless and your cell mate hopeful
the men who received the serum gained
the idea i do not know how that they
were going to get well in every way and
when they did that i was going to par-
don them they were filled with hope

  naturally the rest of the men wanted
the same thing to happen to them they
were not sure what it was but they
knew it was something and they wanted
it so they have gone on a hunger
strike seven hundred of them and they
swear they will not eat a bite till they
get what they call fair play so far
there has been no violence but hell is
likely to break out at any moment and
the men who are getting well are sym-
pathetic they are saying that the
medicine ought to be given to all of
the prisoners

tf you are willing to do so gover-
nor replied biddle we will do
that it will not take long for me to get
enough serum from my laboratories

and with the physicians we have here
the work can be completed in a very few
days that ought to satisfy them

  it will and i think you had better
send for the medicine but i am afraid
it will not satisfy others we have five
prisons in the state and then there are
the reporters i am actually afraid to
leave the prison they feel that there is
something big happening and they want
the details what can i say to them
and if i say it will they believe me
you have started something big but
how is it going to end and what shall
i do with these men after they have
turned this prison into a paradise are
they still guilty

  what does the warden say gover-
nor asked biddle

  of course he is a penologist he has
looked on this type of human behavior
as hopeless even now he says that they
are suffering from some type of group
hysteria that in reality they are just as
wicked and just as sick as they ever
were

  what do the physicians say

  they are talking their heads off and
working twenty hours a day studying
their pets each man has seen some im-
possible condition change for the better
one man was almost dead from cancer
of the throat from hour to hour they
expected the disease to eat into a large
blood-vessel and the man to bled to
death now they say the man is going
to recover of course they say that
occasionally a cancer will do that but
they feel that too many things like that
are going on at the same time first
they talked of coincidence and now
some of them are talking of omnipot-
ence they swear they are going to do
something to you torture you if neces-
sary to make you tell them what it is
you injected into the veins of these
seven hundred degenerates and some-
thing has to be done


amazing stories

  we will do it you announce to the
prisoners that i am sending for some
more medicine and that as soon as it
comes every man will receive a dose and
the medicine will be the same and the
dosage the same as was given to the
other prisoners

vtou can tell the doctors and spe-
x cialists that at the proper time i
will make an announcement to repre-
sentatives of the ethical medical societies
of the united states and when i do
that i will give the secret free to the
nation in the meantime explain to
them that they have had a wonderful op-
portunity to see the drug tested on over
fourteen hundred cases and that it
would be a good idea if they would pre-
pare a report to the american medical
association so that when the time
comes that body of physicians will not
think that i am some kind of a charlatan

  as far as the reporters are concerned
tell them that in twenty-four hours you
will have a statement to make giving
them the bald facts of what has been
going on in farview prison i will help
you prepare that statement now i
guess that ought to please everybody
but you said that it would take thirty
days before the full effects of the drug
could be observed

  that is true and we will not make
any extravagant claims at this time
and you will send for the seven
hundred doses at once

  yes my private secretary is here
in his airplane i will ask him to go
to my laboratories and have the drug
rushed here i will start him at once
the wolf of wall street had over-
heard all of the conversation biddle
took him to one side and gave him a
philadelphia address

  you will have to take a letter there
for me they will give you the package

and you can send it back by special mes-
senger

  but how about me i heard you
promise to release the news to the papers
in twenty-four hours

  well what of it i did not forget
my promise you have your plane when
you leave here get to the nearest big
city take over a private line and bum
the news over to your city editor tell
him anything you want to right at this
minute you have or at least i think you
have over twenty thousand words typed
and ready for the press in a few hours
you can bring that news up to date
and have the special edition of the pur-
ple flash on the streets you ought to
have at least twenty hours lead on every
other paper in the states more than
that you have a rather clear idea of
what it means you can use all of your
information except one  thing and that
is my name now i will write the letter
and you start better not let those boys
outside the walls learn who you are
if they do you will not get far

  this is wonderful biddle whispered
the secret owner of the purple flash
it will put my paper at the head of all
of them and increase the circulation by
five million could i speak to a few of
these doctors and sign them up for
some future articles

  no the last thing in the world i
want is for them to find out who you
are all i want is for you to keep quiet
for a little while

  once hiram smith was safely up in
the air biddle returned to the governor
he said

  suppose we start writing that state-
ment for the papers

  i think that would be a good idea
assented the executive what do you
think we had better say

  not too much and not too little
something like this

  for the last two weeks governor
life everlasting



watkins has been personally supervis-
ing the giving of a tiew form of medical
treatment to all of the inmates of far-
view prison the prisoners treated have
been under the care of medical and
sociological experts who at the end of
thirty days will make a preliminary re-
port for the present all that can be
said is that the health of the prisoners is
excellent one half of the prison popu-
lation -were treated two weeks ago and
the other half will be treated in the
next thirty-six hours the governor in-
tends remaining at farview till the ex-
piration of thirty days at which time
he will permit the medical experts con-
ducting the experiment to make what-
ever statement they wish till that time
no statement not signed by the gov-
ernor can be considered trustworthy

signed watkins

that ought to be satisfacory gov-
     ernor said biddle

  sure just enough to finish their in-
sanity

 do you want to tell them the
truth 

  i would if i were sure but suppose
the warden is right what if they
are not well just think they are

  biddle shook his head

  i think i know how you feel i
have used this scrum on hundreds of
animals i saw its effect on five people
in new york before i came to you i
think i know what it will do but even
now i am not sure if i were sure i
would give a dose to my son you see
he is well not actually sick but ab-
normal in some ways i do not want
to give it to him till i am sure so i
am waiting i hoped that after this
prison experiment  could go ahead with
him now if i feel that way what is
to keep you from doubting suppose
we get something to eat and then spend
the rest of the night seeing some of your

cases  want to talk with them espe-
cially some of the psychopathic person-
alities and mental defectives i am a
little more interested in their minds and
souls than i am in their bodies

  you think they are going to change
   that way

  yes the serum seems to work in
any kind of sickness and after all a
bad man is simply a sick man

chapter viii

the aroused nation

within the next twenty-four
hours the purple flash gave
to the nation and incidentally
to the world the first of a series
of articles on the new serum the
paper was being sold on the streets
of new york one hour before the
signed statement of the governor of
ohio was handed to the impatient re-
porters surrounding the prison they
could each take that statement and em-
bellish it as they saw fit but practically
all they said was pure imagination
meantime the purple flash was giving
to the world thousands of words well
written and apparently so authentic that
all of those who read were forced to
believe

  there were millions however of
american citizens who only had access
to the twisted garbled accounts written
by reporters who had little but fancy to
draw upon half truths are worse than
whole lies and at once a tangled fiction
spread especially through ohio as to
just what was going on at farview
prison a chicago paper driven to de-
spair by the success of the purple flash
started to publish a series of articles in
which the direct charge was made that
ohio forced to balance its budget was
experimenting with a new form ot
euthanasia whereby thousands of its


amazing stories

criminals abnormals and defectives
would rapidly die and thus relieve the
state of their financial care the fact
that many states were having difficulty
in providing for their welfare depart-
ments made this appear plausible in
addition the personal attendance of the
governor of ohio his secreting him-
self in farview prison for several weeks
his calling out the national guard his
employment of additional prison guards
the use of medical experts the definite
secrecy the quarantine the peculiar
and even somewhat ambiguous statement
given to the press all this could only
mean one thing and that was something
so terrible that it could not be spoken of
too strongly ohio was starting to free
herself of the burden of life-care of the
hopeless criminal class

  the chicago freepress carefully
avoiding the law of libel became elo-
quent in its defense of the forgotten
men the lifers in the ohio prisons
after all they were human beings made
in the image of god though sen-
tenced to life imprisonment deprived of
their citizenship without homes family
or hope they were still worthy of help

  the freepress pointed out that if this
condition was encouraged there was
nothing to prevent other states following
the example of ohio it showed how
much illinois new york california
could save by the immediate destruction
of all of its criminals and abnormals
it asked whether there was any real
difference between the slaughter of the
innocents at the time christ was bom
and the slaughter of the criminals at a
time when his teachings were being for-
gotten by a mob of politicians driven to
impotent fear by the mob of taxpayers
at their heels

  in some way this paper obtained the
names of the inmates of the farview
penitentiary it hunted up their rel-

atives the wives mothers and children
of these men the reporters told them
that their beloved men were being killed
in the name of science and then ob-
tained their pictures and took their state-
ments and recorded their tears it
made wonderful sob-stuff other papers
followed the example of the freepress

  charges were made that the purple
flash was being subsidized by the ohio
governor to give a false account of the
experiment in order to deceive the pub-
lic soapbox orators addressed the un-
employed on street corners for a few
days the issue tended to become a na-
tional one fraternal organizations paid
the expense of the families of the crim-
inals to farview where their hands held
at the wrists by agitators knocked with-
out avail on the steel gates of the prison

veryone talked of the serum

     those who knew the least about it
talked the most it was discussed from
the pulpit the radio and the stage
meanwhile day after day the purple
flash continued its series of articles
which were so impossible that no one
believed in them at the same time all
read them

  at last the excitement became so
great that the president of the united
states determined that it was his duty
as the head of the nation to make a
personal investigation of the matter
and irrespective of what the real truth
was to give it to a nation fast growing
hysterical without parade or publicity
he made the journey from washington
to farview and was inside the walls of
the prison twenty-four hours before
the group of experts were ready to give
their statement to the papers

  the first interview with welfare wat-
kins took place behind closed doors in
the wardens office sidney biddle was
the third member of the conference

i suppose you know why i am here
life everlasting



   president there has been
i hysteria shown over the news
ohio that i felt it my duty to
be re and make a personal inquiry

governor that you will not feel

    i	itz doubting you and the work
    tit state but    you have read

th i-ovemor smiled at the president

   e he rclied

thais all right no apologies are
if you had waited another day
rerialists would have given you
report and when that report is
to the press some of the papers
ley those in chicago will be rather
 of the tommy-rot they have
feeding to the gullible public
- only one thing we have been
ith these convicts and that is
 hem restoring their health ap-
tly burning the evil from their per-
eies making real men out of them
eg - ju read the articles in the pur-
w fshr
i have the terrible side of their
co a deceiving the public is the
that they are so well written that
seem to be the truth

   -rpose we have mr biddle an-
jtst- - it you should understand mr
fbesadem that mr biddle is very much
ted in this experiment he
more about it than anyone else
do you think of the truth of the
n the flash
tbs main facts are all true of
r-crv the editors had no real scientific
t---nation concerning the composition
rt the serum used their guesses of
future use of the serum may stem
it te sdence-fiction but the premises are
r-err and their conclusions may be
rzrzsll correct the secret owner of
tse flash is vitally interested his son
was cre of the first five human beings
 receive the serum

  the president looked at biddle in
astonishment at last he said

  there must be a mistake somewhere
my personal physician rear admiral
stone went over the account of those
first five cases and he told me that no
medicine could accomplish what was
claimed for it in those five cases he
said that it would have to be a cure-all
a panacea

  he should have said that there was
no known medicine that could do it
wa biddles calm reply but now that
you are here why not see the prisoners
the thirty day period will be up for half
of them to-morrow and it has been about
eighteen days since the other half re-
ceived their serum i suppose governor
that there will be no objection to the
presidents seeing the men 

  none at all suppose i have them
line up on the parade ground i could
have you interview the prison surgeon
and the chaplain i could have the
various specialists and the psychologists
tell you about the changes that have
taken place in these fourteen hundred
men but i guess it will be best to have
you see them as a group first do
you know what the usual collection of
life-term prisoners look like are you ac-
quainted with the prison pallor can
you identify the look of hopeless hate
the insane eye the lustful cunning of
the psychopath do you know how a
man feels when he knows that he will
never leave a prison till he dies

  i have been in a good many prisons
acknowledged the president

  then you will be able to detect
the difference between the average lot
of prisoners and these men we are go-
ing to show you i will give the order
the men will fall in the band will start
playing and the men will pass in review
we have done a lot of drilling lately
the men are feeling so well that they
are keen for all forms of exercise t


amazing stories

will call the warden and in ten minutes
we can go out and watch them they
have a setting up exercise that is espe-
cially fine they strip to the waist for
that

fifteen minutes later the review-
ing party saw over fourteen hundred
men pass in review in perfect time
beautiful formation they marched with
the sure step and certain time of well
drilled soldiers and back of every move-
ment was glorious health the joy of
being alive and well later they took
off their coats and shirts and went
through a complicated series of setting
up exercises the president broke his
fifty minute silence

  no prison pallor there he ex-
claimed those men are sunburned
athletes where are your sick men the
hospital cases

  that is not sunburn replied biddle
for some reason not clear to me the
serum turns the skin a beautiful golden
tan the two women i gave it to have
the most wonderful complexion you ever
saw in regard to the sick men those
who were in the hospital dying from
cancer tuberculosis syphilis and every
possible result of vicious living they
are all out on the parade ground there
has not been a death in the pris-
on this month and at the present time
there is not a single patient in the prison
hospital physically they are well
the president shook his head

  but the chicago papers said that
you were experimenting with a new
form of euthenasia that you were going
to kill them

  doesnt look like it does it an-
swered the governor and these men
are not only well physically but there
is a change mentally just wait till you
hear the sociologists and psychologists
and psychiatrists report on the changes
in their mentality their personality their

viewpoint on life their moral sense it
raises a very serious question biddle
and i have talked about it we do
not know what we ought to do with
these men

  they are all old offenders are they
not

  yes but suppose we show that they
were sick when they broke the laws and
that now they have recovered from their
sickness and wont break any more laws
shall they be punished for being sick

  i dont know admitted the presi-
dent but i want to talk to some of
them i want to see for myself and

i	want to talk to some of the doctors
who have spent the month here and i
think i want to talk with the warden
after that if what appears true is true

i	feel it my duty to issue a statement to
the american people tell me one
thing who discovered this remedy
does the man know the full extent of
its power what is he goingto charge
for it can the nation buy it is there
a chance that he will become worried
over the publicity and go and sell it
to a foreign power how is he going to
act what this man biddle the in-
ventor then i must talk to him first

the president of the united states
was a man who was close to the
common people as far as the nation
was concerned he was as welfare-
minded as was the governor of ohio
he was not an intense isolationist but
he did feel that the good of his people
was more important than the good of a
dozen nationalities of europe and asia
while he was not a socialist he be-
lieved in equal opportunities for those
who were equally adequate to profit by
them

  during the three years he had served
as president he had seen the national
debt grow taxes increase and unem-
ployment become more prevalent while
life everlasting



he had seen the convicts on parade he
had been impressed by their glorious
buoyancy their apparent health he
knew with a fair degree of accuracy
what the federal prisons were costing
the taxpayer and whatever may have
been the route of his thinking he rapidly
reached the point where he saw that the
wealth of the nation would have to im-
prove with the health of the individ-
ual the prevention of crime was sec-
ondary in his thought to the cure of
diseases which otherwise were forcing
the nation the commonwealths and the
large cities to spend an ever increasing
percentage of their funds in hospital-
ization

  in the cure of hookworm the fight
against yellow fever malaria smallpox
and tuberculosis the nation had ever
been active in association with various
foundations it was natural for the
chief executive to feel that if a new
drug a startling medicine a universal
panacea was discovered it should belong
to the nation laws would have to be
made for its use a machinery devised
for its distribution in every way it
would have to be protected and guarded
against the efforts of the unscrupulous
to commercialize it to make its use
possible only to the wealthy the pam-
pered favorites of fortune

  he wanted to talk to biddle

  the result of that conference had
ramifications neither dreamed of

chapter ix

congress changes

the president worked at intense
pressure for twelve hours and at
the end of that time issued the fol-
lowing statement to the press

  i wish to announce that i have per-
sonally made an investigation of the
health programme of the state oj ohio

as practised at farview prison and feel
that it has been to the definite advantage
of all the inmates all have been greatly
benefited and nothing has happened to
any of them that in any way can be con-
sidered as prejudicial to their health
happiness or future should they at any
time be pardoned and restored to their
former citizenship

signed richard caldwell

  and exactly twelve hours after this
statement was broadcast to the nation
the general report of the specialists
who had been observing the work of
the scrum was likewise released to the
press after that there was a rapid
exodus from the farview prison of the
experts and the seal of secrecy being
broken a wide expression of universal
opinion was given these men were
all specialists in their line men who
knew so much about a little that some
of them had reached the point where
they knew everything about nothing for
thirty days they had lived in an atmos-
phere of the fantastic and impossible
they had seen the impossible happen
every belief of theirs shattered it was
almost necessary for them to recon-
struct their scientific world under or-
dinary circumstances most of them
would have doubted and remained silent
but now they had to talk and as talking
was very profitable they gave their
opinions to the world

  the majority believed that the treat-
ment was highly tonic to a great de-
gree stimulative and restorative but it
could not be anything permanent the
marked improvement could only be con-
sidered as a temporary change only
the future could determine whether oth-
er doses of the serum would be equally
potent all felt that nothing but benefit
had resulted from the first dose but
several raised the point that it might
result in drug addiction would the

individual be able to live without a con-
stantly increasing dose

  the president went back to wash-
ington met with his cabinet and as a
result of that conference invited one
hundred of the leaders of american
politics to come to washington this
list included senators representatives
governors and mayors of seven of the
largest cities and six of the silent ad-
visers of the administration the se-
lection was carefully made not a man
was invited who was not in absolute
control of his district and not one of the
hundred was in good health they
ruled now but in ten years the major-
ity would be dead merely historical
names fast passing into oblivion

  the invitation was carefully worded
the president invited them to meet him
to consider a matter important to the
economic welfare of the nation up
to the time he began to address them
the majority of his guests believed that
the subject to be discussed was purely
of a financial nature he lost no time in
telling them the real reason

  the meeting was held in the green
room of the white house present
were the president his cabinet the
vice president the one hundred invited
conferees and biddle the man of mys-
tery

  you have all been reading began
the president of the work done at
farview prison ohio by the governor
of that state over fourteen hundred
prisoners were given a single dose of a
serum and the effect on their general
health and mentality was studied by a
carefully selected corps of experts as
you know i made a trip to farview
prison and personally investigated this
experiment as a result i conferred
with the inventor of this serum mr
biddle and secured from him a promise

up to the present time even- great
discovery leading to improvement of the
lives of our people has passed into the
control of private corporations steam
electricity the telegraph telephone and
radio are all controlled and operated by
private capital

  insulin was given to the diabetics of
the world by its discoverers but that is
one of the few exceptions to the rule
we are citing here

  i am going to bring the entire prob-
lem to the attention of congress in
the meantime it is of importance to us
as leaders of national thought to have
a first-hand observation of the use of
the new drug and its powers only
by this method can we properly deter-
mine the matters pertaining to its uni-
versal use in our nation i have invited
you here not only because you are lead-
ers of your communities and can sway
public opinion but also because i have
reason to feel that you are all sick men
my advisers tell me that few of the
men in this room will be alive at the
expiration of ten years thus you are
admirable subjects for demonstrating the
power of this drug mr biddle has
everything ready to give all of you an
intravenous injection i am not offering
you something i am afraid of myself

the trick

he girl was alert almost as
soon as she opened her eyes
she eyed him askance

  venia i have thought of
something it is our only
chance

  she sat up quickly mansfield took
from his hip the revolver and held it
aloft

  youve seen how this works with
what quickness i dispatch the blacks
he knocked it open and put new shells
into it this-he showed her the
pressing of the trigger-is how it
works carefully he went into elabora-
tion of the handling of the gun and
the highly developed mind of the girl
understood readily

  it is our only chance venia the
blacks have never seen anyone else but
myself use it they think that no one
else can that is shown by the way
they took you right under my eyes you
are supposed to be harmless what i
am going to do is this i am going to
give it to you then i shall crouch be-
neath the panel when they open it to
see how we are faring they will not
be able to see me unless they lean out

and look down if they were to see
me they would close that panel instant-
ly but after one look if they dont
find me they will think that i have per-
ished understand i want the black
to lean in ill take care of him you
are to press this trigger on any face that
shows up near him

  the girl fell in with the plan with
shining eyes but are you sure i can

use this-this-

  he laughed exuberantly you cant
help it just hold it tight and point it
directly at the black head or body and
pull that finger dont be frightened by
the noise all i want is just one black
skull to come into the pit just one
shoot anyone who tries to close the
panel fear naught

  it infused them both with new cour-
age they discussed it from all angles
they are bound to open that panel
some time he told her it is the
only way they can find out what we are
doing whether any of us have gone
down-there

the girl stationed herself a little
distance away from the closed open-
ing mansfield crouched right under it
the girl was to keep the weapon from
view in case a black eye would alight
upon it at the very beginning then to


amazing stories

mansfield saw with relief that the girl had sped up the stairs of the basement
and he followed with long strides firing backward at the heads which were

bobbing out of the entrance
the lost city



use it swiftly he was to keep his eyes
on her and when she nodded he would
know that the hole had been opened

  they settled down to wait it was
only a matter of waiting the panel
would be opened some time it seemed
like hours to mansfield as he slouched
there his knees were becoming numbed
but he didnt dare move for fear that it
might be at that moment that the blacks
would deem it the right time to open
it his eyes were glued on the face of
the girl for some sign her eyes were
centered upon the closed portal

  just when he felt that he would have
to change his position or drop there was
a flicker in the girls face she nodded
imperceptibly the hand behind her
tensing

  he looked up and saw that a square
light was thrown against the wall it
was now or never were he to lose
this chance it was a foregone conclusion
he would never get another one even
a black mind wouldnt fall for this sim-
ple trick twice in succession mansfield
had accomplished it once before but no
black knew of that that unfortunate
fellow was now a dissolved thing some-
where at the bottom of the circular pit in
which reposed the man-eating matter

  he heard a voice above him say

  look the stranger has at last
fallen into the pit good the girl is
crouched there yet

  several voices broke into a gleeful
cheer in the ante-room to mansfield
the sound of those throats meant that
he would have to strike decisively
the element of surprise must not be
lost all of them must not be given
time to coordinate their actions

  he saw venia nod again an outline
of a blackish physiognomy shadowed the
wall and then the full head was thrust
forward into the chamber

  like a flash of lightning his arms
moved up and fixed themselves around

that neck a heave and the body was
half way through bands of steel
crushed the breath from the negro he
was at such a disadvantage that he
couldnt bring his arms into play and
thus mansfield held him choking him
into submission and the englishman
saw with a cheering glance that so long
as he kept the fellow half-in and half-
out it would be impossible to close the
panel

  a black face slipped closer to the
opening there was an upraised club and
venia moved in front of him and fired
he flopped backward into the remain-
ing black who was right behind him

  quick she cried they are down
release him

  mansfield steadied himself and let
sail the fellow a hoarse howl of horror
throated from him but it was the last
sound he ever made he bounced out of
view presently

  mansfield lifted the girl and tossed
her through the aperture following with
a bound that knocked him off his feet as
he alighted right atop the fallen blacks
immediately he was clenched with the
rising negro who sunk his teeth into his
ear venia huddled against the wall
watched entranced the flailing arms the
rippling muscles their freedom had
been enacted within such a brief inter-
val that she was momentarily stunned
the gun hanging limply from her fin-
gers but a gasp fell from her lips
as she saw the huge paw of the black
slowly forcing back mansfields head
and she plunged into them pointing the
muzzle of the weapon at the hideous
head pulling the trigger the negros
head turned his eyes wide open his
hands relaxed he dropped on the
ground

  the strange weapon however was too
much for the girl of atlantis the su-
pernatural ease and manner with which
it dealt with the enemy was not lost upon


amazing stories

her and awed her deeply she fell back
against the wall the revolver slipping
from her finger tips mansfield caught
it as it fell his hand touching hers
there was gratitude in his eyes her
soft skin electrified him

  the next moment he had crushed her
to him and was kissing her milk-white
brow she clung to him with her re-
maining strength eagerly it was the
first manifestation of love mansfield had
ever shown to any bit of womanhood
but it had not its origin then many
hours of fearful ordeals had they suf-
fered together many moments of try-
ing hardships these had molded them
together

  strangely enough no blacks had come
plowing into the chamber after all the
shouting and noise but mansfield saw
that the fellow venia had first fired
upon was now returning to conscious-
ness he sat up and looked stupidly at
the two who stood over him held a hand
to a creased head from which blood was
dripping he cowered at the sight of
the gun pointed at his breast

  mansfield stood looking at him a
jubilant feeling came over him it was
indeed fortunate that venia hadnt killed
this fellow he was injured enough to
be incapable of fighting but he was be-
coming clear-minded to answer ques-
tions and that was what was wanted
now from this black mansfield could
find out how to get out of the beastly
hole

  he prodded him with the gun with
terrifying motions and the black
screamed perspiration was pouring
down his face eyes were distended

  do you want to die the scientist
barked

  the huddling man shook his head vio-
lently shrinking still farther away
from the thing which catapulted death
no no

  you will die by this fire from the

heaven if you dont reply to my ques-
tion 

  the ebony face twitched ill tell you
anything

  mansfield glared at him how do you
get out of here

  the black man of atlantis stared at
him eyes rolling then pointed toward the
door but mansfield jabbed the gun into
his ribs with a suddenness that knocked
him against the wall the crcature cried
that way that way

  and he pointed directly through the
panel of the pit of doom

  sir john mansfields brow furrowed in
surprise in wonder what was this
fellow talking about anyway he
smiled wryly

  sure everybody goes out that way
-for ever and if you dont answer im-
mediately thats where you go

  the black had great respect for the
ever-shifting gun his eyes were con-
stantly upon its prowling mouth and
when it came nearer to him he howled
shudderingly

  that way that way

  something in the mans frightened
face seemed to tell mansfield that he
wasnt lying but he couldnt believe
for a moment that the pit chamber was
the outlet of this subterranean abode it
didnt sound reasonable

  he prodded the fellow toward the
panel

  now get me you scoundrel into
that opening you go show me what
you mean what entrance are you talk-
ing about and dont forget one false
move out of you and this-he patted
the gun-will spit into you from any
distance

  the man nodded briskly understand-
ing he leaped with alacrity through
the aperture into the pit of the man-
eating matter the way in which he
jumped into it proved without a doubt
to the scientist that there was some
the lost city



way somewhere in there the black had
no fear of the grisly chamber

  the fellow walked cautiously around
the precarious ledge and came at the
opposite end to a blank slab his fum-
bling fingers pressed something in-
stantly a huge blackness showed behind
a swinging rock the black pointed

  mansfield and venia felt a tingling at
the sight of the exit it was the last
place where they would ever expect it
and how ingenious it was any body of
invaders could come rushing through it
only to be forced by their own momen-
tum into the ghastly circular pit below
nothing could stop them it was a fine
piece of black strategy uncovered only
through the fears of a black for a weap-
on which had him frightened stiff

  mansfield lifted the girl through the
panel and followed her he grasped her
hand and led her carefully around the
ledge the lighted pit in the center had
little terror for them now they were
soon standing next to the palsied black

  at that moment there came a roar of
human voices faces loomed in the
panel opening and pointed and gestic-
ulated toward them they were shriek-
ing frenziedly at the black who had
broken his faith and had shown the two
prisoners the precious exit from their
hidden depth curses and more curses
burst upon them

  mansfield was thankful that the mob
hadnt burst in upon them a few mo-
ments before they would never have
been able to overcome such numbers or
get through the paneled opening safely
and even as he watched he saw the
foremost blacks clambering over into
the chamber via the panel

  he poked the injured black lead
and remember one tricky move out of
you and you go to join your fathers

  into the opening they ran the howls
of the pursuers splitting their ear-drums
as they advanced

chapter xvi

the escape

the tunnel was as dark as night
for a short distance then from the
walls there came that effulgence
which was so commonplace in atlantis
it lighted up the passage and mansfield
saw that the tunnel was about fifteen
feet wide giving enough room for a
number of men to move along abreast
then the footing became uncertain as
the stpne floor shot upward at a sharp
angle it wasnt easy to sprint up this
with speed

  the black however seemed not to
mind the grade as he ran before them
his feet carrying him swiftly until he
was a good distance ahead of the hurry-
ing pair mansfield let out a yell which
halted him dead in his tracks and
brought him scurrying back the sci-
entist couldnt afford to lose this black
now on him they depended upon all
of their freedom he and he alone
knew where they were going and the
way he tried to outpace them and lose
them showed his anxiety of getting out
of the range of the gun which mansfield
now held

  up and up they ran behind them
they could hear the steadily rising voices
of the blacks if those fellows ran as
fast as the black in front of them they
would soon overtake them they were
probably used to this he and venia
were not and there was immediate
danger of slipping and falling his
boots were not made to fly over this
sharp stone incline they were con-
stantly skidding from under him

  it was with a glad cry that he saw
the walls of the tunnel coming together
and soon they were gliding between a
space where he could reach out with
outstretched arms and touch both sides
at one time that meant much right


amazing stories

now it wouldnt prevent a horde from
coming upon them from the rear at one
time the pursuers would have to move
up in double file at the most

  mansfield ran immediately behind the
daughter of the high priest he mar-
veled at the agility with which those
slender legs carried her ahead she
was like a breath of wind now every
moment seemed to give her new
strength her chest rose and fell with-
out strain she had adapted herself to
the situation with a vim

  he glanced behind him and saw the
foremost of the blacks running swiftly
his club held like a feather in his hands
it roused the fury in the black face as
mansfield looked back he lifted his
burly stick and swung it viciously

  there came a bend in the tunnel and
the black ahead flitted around it venia
following mansfield came to a sudden
halt whirled and fired the black let
out a shriek of pain and plunged through
the air to fall with a crunch that
sounded like snapping bones the body
turned over and over and the scientists
eye just as he was disappearing around
the turn caught the rushing blacks bowl-
ing into the prone figure and piling upon
each other blocking up the passage

  the pause would help them a lot he
knew they couldnt go on running like
this all day the blacks were far swift-
er than they the underground channel
had to lead somewhere and end some-
time he caught sight of the girl ahead
running smoothly and the black his
feet animated by the sound of the
loathesome gun put on another burst
of speed

  far behind him came the resumption
of the pursuit they were on the trail
once more detained no longer by the
body of the black leader the scientist
panting from the exertion caught up
with the girl and pattered behind her
he saw the black slow down and come

to a stop all three of them stopped in
their tracks to keep from bumping into
each other they had come to the end
of the tunnel

tjigures were appearing at the
other end of the passage around
that bend accompanied by outbursts that
sent them baffled by a blank wall into
anxious haste

  quick mansfield commanded the
black open it up

  the fellow eyed those of his own ilk
who were tearing up the narrow lighted
path he hesitated for a moment but
only for a moment for the scientist
wasnt fooling with him now he
slammed the negro against the wall with
one hand and with the other fired the
gun nipping the blacks ear

  the fellows eyes were crazed with
fear he cried and sobbed and begged
seeing death staring him in the face not
more than seventy-five feet away were
the howling blacks mansfield gave
them a swift glance jerked the negro
back to his feet with a prod in the
stomach that almost doubled him up

  the black fingers dived for the wall
met a small dent instantly the primary
rock fell backward and mansfield found
himself looking into the littered cellar
in which he had once gone searching
around he uttered a cry of delight
shoving the girl recklessly through the
opening whirling just in time to face
the nearest black ten feet away who
was bounding with upraised club

  he didnt hesitate the revolver
spurted flame the impetus carried the
victim on to drop him two feet away
from the englishman the club bouncing
past mansfield and through the open-
ing the closest black had been dealt
with

  the ebony men set up a terrific din
as they saw their quarry dive through
the portal and disappear they dived
the lost city



after him with murder in their eyes to
meet the cracking of the gun nothing
could keep them back they were in-
sane for white blood they were hellishly
crazed for the feeling of white skin be-
neath their tearing hands

  mansfield saw with relief that the
girl had sped up the stairs of the base-
ment and he followed with long strides
firing backward at the heads which were
bobbing out of the entrance

  but his part in the affair was over
rushing down the steps came the white
men of atlantis swinging their ray
cylinders like heavy bludgeons instead
of with the slow paralyzing cylinders
the two bodies of men met fiercely
though the whites were vastly superior
in numbers

  out on the plain mansfield saw venia
in the arms of her father he was hold-
ing her close as though never to let her
go men were grouped about them
sending up cheer after cheer they
piled around the torn and disheveled
stranger like a brother long-lost hands
patted him on the shoulder everybody
wanted to touch him to praise him

  the high priest took the scientist by
the arm

  sir john we searched long for you
and venia and were on the verge of
giving up we were just about ready to
leave in force when we heard those loud
crashes of your weapon may the gods
heap upon your divine head their benign
favors

there was a kindness and warmth
from yuxa which abashed mans-
field the haughty eyes were humbling
themselves before him the high priest
held the form of his daughter tightly
gripping the arm of the stranger with
the other hand

  behind them still continued the noise
of the fighting but it was dying out
the vehement voices of the blacks were

thinning out as more and more of the
whites tore down into the cellar to
throw themselves into the thick of it
mansfield looked around him and saw
that a vast army of white men were as-
sembled waiting for some official word
to be heard now that they had discov-
ered the entrance to the black under-
ground pits but the englisman turned
to the high priest

  yuxa call back your men do not
let them go through the tunnel

  the leader of the whites gazed at him
inquiringly why 

  rapidly he told of the precarious foot-
ing which was afforded down the pas-
sageway which led into the pit of doom
there was not enough room there to
begin hand-to-hand engagement save for
several men and the pit of the man-
eating plant was all against them even
if they succeeded in getting into it there
wasnt any way of getting through un-
less through the panel and a whole
army of men couldnt get through that
at one time the blacks had the decided
advantage any way one looked at it they
could pick off their assailants one at a
time

  but it was an advantage to the whites
too mansfield pointed out the blacks
couldnt get out either the logic of it
struck home with the high priest imme-
diately immediately the officers were
giving the men the order to recede leav-
ing but a handful of whites to guard the
entrance to the cellar

  some other means must be had
mansfield advised them and then it
came to him-the solution he pulled
yuxa close and told him it will take
time but it is the best way start im-
mediately and dig a half dozen tunnels
underground underneath the wall of the
man-eating plant and have these tunnels
break into the corridors of the blacks
all at one time in that way you all can
pile into them at once


amazing stories

  the city of atlantis feted the stranger
as no city ever feted a victor before
women tall and beautiful twined their
arms around him as he strode along and
kissed him unreservedly and unashamed-
ly his embarrassment rose when the
men too threw their arms about him
and pressed their kisses of undying
friendship upon his brow it was a cus-
tom which they now imbibed to their
fullest-and to the englishmans dismay
and horror and occasionally he glanced
back to see yuxa smiling upon him and
venias rapt eyes centered upon his face
his dirty and torn garments were a pit-
iable sight in his own eyes but they
seemed to be a handsome shroud of vic-
tory to them all

  handsome children straight as ar-
rows clambered between his knees and
he had to reach down and drag them to
his shoulders it was a constant cheer
that burst from their throats never
had he remotely realized that some day
he might be received like this anywhere
let alone in a strange land which had
never had the light of day the breath of
anything but a self-manufactured at-
mosphere

  it was the first time he really saw at-
lantis for what it was the picture re-
mained with him forever-women like
venia with a superbness of grace and
body that was dream-like in aspect men
with a warmth of character and heart
that had existed only in theory and
fancy far and away stretched the
great city brilliant lights of every hue
myriads of rays flashed across the sub-
terranean sky a gorgeous spectrum of
color

stork was halted at every depth
  every black vassal came to the top
to gorge himself with the huge platters
of food which appeared from every-
where to drink from the deep urns of
the exhilarating liquids the return

of the daughter of the high priestr safe
and sound was an occasion of merri-
ment and glee

  mansfield had been separated from
the company of venia and her parent
he had permitted himself to be led from
group to group and to recount over and
over again his magical escapes from the
horrifying pit of doom the thing had
never happened before shudders were
plainly evident blue eyes gaped awedly
upon him he was an object of fascina-
tion

  but he was now tired of this aimless
feasting he wanted more and more
to see venia again to look at her to
feel her soft hand in his finding his
opportunity he dived into a ground por-
tal of the huge temple and disappeared
the hallways seemed dolefully bare and
empty as he walked briskly upward
he felt now that he could find the
upper chambers of the high priest he
wanted to see venia he wanted to be
alone with the girl the memory of
that all-too-brief moment in the ante-
room of the man-eating pit chamber with
venia in his arms blotted out all this
rejoicing he wanted to rejoice with
someone else with her

  swiftly he went up and up turning
into corridor after corridor and after
a time he discovered to his chagrin that
he actually knew little of the temple
every hall passage was similar in aspect
to the next one and though he halted
occasionally and entered sliding panels
he found himself in unfamiliar and
empty rooms during ordinary times
there would have been somebody going
or coming and he would have been put
upon the proper path but they were all
down below now singing and making
merry he roamed the corridors until
he knew eventually that he was lost

  at the far end he saw a lounge
against the wall and he sat down and
scratched his head hed stay around
the lost city



until someone came by and then get
his bearings then he bolted upright
someone was speaking to him

  you are an inspired man sir john
mansfield you are truly gifted

  it was the loud raucous voice the
mystery of that entity had been torn
from his mind by the rapidly ensuing
events and he had completely forgot-
ten about it but now it sounded all
around him speaking with candor and
directness at him

  he leaped to his feet and stared with
narrowed eyes at the walls where was
this thing coming from what uttered
those words in such an insipid tone

chapter xvii

the shocking discovery

mansfields flicking and pene-
trative glances saw a portal at
the other end of the corridor
open and a figure emerge gazing
around for some answer to the sound
heard it was yuxa and he immedi-
ately made for him pattering down the
heavily rugged floor the high priest
saw him coming and greeted him be-
hind him through the opened panel the
scientist saw the girl

  yuxa approached him and laid his
arm around him with utmost affection

  venia has told me everything-my
son

  they entered the room the girl was
attired in fresh garments a new robe
reaching to her knees and a resplen-
dent tiara which encircled her blonde
head like a halo mansfield took her in
his arms and kissed her

  may ra bless you my children
the high priest said with an effusive ex-
pression in his eyes

  suddenly venias head fell from his
shoulder and bowed the voice was
speaking again

  conduct the ritual of victory to ra in
the holy chamber yuxa

  mansfield was angry decidedly an-
gry his blood cavorted madly at the
sound of that voice what beastly right
had it to break him from the ecstatic
feeling of holding the daughter of the
high priest in his arms it was the
voice of a confounded old rascal thats
what it was his mind tensed with the
unuttered desire hed find out the
source of that thing before many hours
were over hed drag it all over the
floor for the white men to see what
sort of ra was using them in ridiculous
subjection yes-hed-- but con-
found it that voice had spoken for ages
what was this

yfuxa stood in reverent position for
a moment then quit the room venia
went to the wall and opened a large
portion of it giving a wide view of the
bustling throng below she leaned out
with him at her side the men and
women below caught a glimpse of them
and burst into hailing cries their
arms flung upward in commendatory
gestures their throats yelling themselves
hoarse

  the figure of the high priest appeared
and all became still soon there was
a steady flow into the temple up to the 
chamber of the supreme deity of -at-
lantis the god worshipped by the an-
cient egyptians and later supplanted in
the faith of the men of atlantis by
that ancient character cheops the vic-
tory ritual was a holy one

  the two stood next to each other
looking down presently there were but
a few left below those on guard

  come sir john we must go now
the chamber of ra was a vast amphi-
theater with a huge golden throne
near the dais mansfield entering the
room from a corner near the altar re-
called the time he had gone through it


amazing stories

with yuxa and he distinctly remem-
bered that the high priest had told him
that the delicately carved seat had never
contained any living person that it was
the recipient of ra at all times

  the place was peculiarly quiet for all
of the many people seated and yet to
be seated all heads were held in re-
spectful posture gone was the exuber-
ance manifested but a short time before
the religious ritual in the chamber of
the great god was too holy a one

  the high priest entered presently and
came quickly up the rugged aisle to
the altar he was now clad in a long
garment which brushed the floor but
his head was bare it was nothing like
those religious displays of the blacks
where a hideous and horrifying face was
used to affect and move the assembled
crowd

  mansfield found himself sitting next
to venia on a small backless bench in
front of yuxa and a short distance away
from the golden throne that dull glis-
tening thing which squatted near the
shrine the englishman concentrated
his gaze upon the seat of precious metal
the chair into which no one had ever
dropped the legs seemed rooted to
the floor strong and well-rounded that
throne of ra would find an open wel-
come in any museum he mused

  the voices about him broke into a
soft purring incantation of one pitch
it was a plea for righteous life and
reward after death for happiness to
continue and to enter into their mode of
existence it was a hearty and true ex-
pression that came from them they
meant every word they said

but this was only the preliminary
prayer he discovered the real
one the victory ritual came later and
what an ear-splitting din it was even
to the sense of the supposedly listening
god it was considered as a holy gesture

every person rose to his feet and threw
up the arms in a plea the lungs took
deep breaths the voices suddenly break-
ing into a growing shriek that con-
tinued until all air was spent following
which they abruptly sat down that
was the victory ritual

  it was all highly interesting to the
scientist he missed nothing however
irrelevant it might appear the victory
ritual to the god ra had been offered
since time immemorial the ancient
egyptians returned from a slain foe
with hailing cries this to which he
had just listened was a perfect replica
of the one of thousands of years ago

  ra to the egyptians was a combina-
tion of the majesties studding the wide
spacious heaven but to atlantis the
meaning of the sun or moon was only
historical something none had ever seen
but those living knew however that
such did exist

  mansfield glanced around at the tap-
estries for some symbol which might
explain the shape of ra generally a
god was caricatured in some form or
fashion but the garbed walls were
bare of anything to that effect only
the golden chair seemed symbolic of
something there was some sort of
inscription upon the legs and arms

  then like a thunderclap there came
upon the assembly a noise like a cough
and another everybody sat immobile
expectant the voice spread over them
and all heads bowed

  high priest of atlantis your vic-
tory ritual has reached the ears of ra
and for the first time in the history of
atlantis there shall be an ascendence
to the heaven seat the heroic stranger
upon the chair of ra

  there was a sharp and breathless halt
mansfields heart was pounding venia
for the first time in her life broke away
from the respectful bow which held her
drooping head and raised it frantically
the lost city



looking at him her eyes were terror-
ized such a thing had never occurred
before in the annals of the underground
land-the seating of anyone upon the
throne of holiness the seat of ra none
knew what would be incurred by that
act there was a fear which leaped from
her beautiful eyes an apprehension
which the englishman did not miss

  sir john mansfields eyes were cloud-
ed was this a trick of some sort
perhaps the blacks were behind this
and they now saw their opportunity of
doing away with him but no how
could the ebony creatures have got
away with this farce for so many ages
it hardly seemed possible

yet there was something here which
forced itself upon the white man
something that he ridiculed as not being
of supernatural and godly potency
there couldnt be anything like that
he wanted badly to uncover it and what
better time was to be had than now
the solution lay within his grasp he
was going to sit down in that golden
throne and await the consequences
something would probably happen and
he intended to solve it all if there
were danger imminent that contingency
was to be met somehow but right now
he must go through with it

  with a soothing shake of the head he
calmed the girl and her tremulous coun-
tenance turned from him to stare ahead
he rose to his feet every head looking
at him unblinkingly and moved toward
the throne standing before it for a
moment he studied intently the construc-
tion but perceived nothing which might
arouse his suspicions everything ap-
peared forward and innocent

  he sat down abruptly a silence
that could have been cut with a knife
held everybody transfixed but nothing
happened

  sitting in the seat was nothing ex-

traordinary it was similar to any other
repose hard and not any too comfort-
able he glanced about him observing
the faces focused upon him then the
voice spoke again with finality upon
trembling twitching nerves

  look upon the courageous man men
of atlantis he goes now

  mansfield had no time to prepare
himself for what followed he was
thrown back into the chair and he clung
hard to the arms as a sudden blinding
flash enveloped the entire dais and the
spot where the chair was placed a
stinging sensation smarted his eyes and
he began to cough as though from
a distance he heard the scream of a
girl and knew that it was venia

  the cloud hung thickly over him
obstructing all vision he shook his
head to clear it suddenly he felt him-
self rising swiftly he knew that the
chair was going straight up with him
for his arms were leaning heavily on
the golden arms of the seat his stom-
ach felt hollow from the spurt up-
ward

  was it really shooting into heaven
he tried to ask himself in amazement
this soaring up and up what was it
what unearthly power made it ascend
it couldnt be supernatural he told him-
self he was a scientist cold and pen-
etrative and that realization made him
shudder he felt now that he had it
he was going to be smashed against the
stone ceiling flattened into a lifeless
form that was it someone was go-
ing to get rid of him

  but nothing like that happened his
head suddenly shot into a brilliant light
that relieved his smarting eyes but daz-
zled him so that he couldnt see any-
thing for a while he stopped cough-
ing and sputtering something tore him
from the chair and threw him upon a
soft bed stunning him but momentarily

  his eyes gradually became used to the


amazing stories

light and he gazed around him the in-
tensity of the illumination was thinning
out

ere a thin voice was speak-
ing to him to his ringing ears
it sounded very much similar to that
raucous voice he whirled sprang to
his feet

  there sitting before a great table
upon which a luminous light fell in bril-
liant lances was a small wizened figure
whose body was dried and thin he
was hairless his face accentuated by
high cheekbones and the only thing he
wore was a metallic girdle of sparkling
color

  the figure radiated an aura of untold
age even as mansfield looked fasci-
natedly at him he could feel those eyes
bearing the weight of many centuries
the thin face bore the semblance of a
smile was this that heavenly entity
ra and was this-was this heaven

  who are you mansfield demanded
in a queer tone

  the other pointed at the table before
him and beckoned come here

  mansfield strode over and gazed upon
the flat top it was some sort of re-
flector lined off into sections his eyes
looked eagerly the old man was point-
ing to a square of large dimensions
tiny dots were spotting the glass he
turned a knob and the section leaped
into huge proportions staring back at
mansfield was a lucid picture of the
chamber of ra the one he had just
quit forcibly

  the englishman saw the impassive
faces staring at the cloud which still
hung around the altar saw venia stand-
ing near her father with her hand
clamped over her mouth then the
mist cleared away and he could see the
golden throne sitting there as it had
always sat and of course it was
empty

  the girl stared at the great throne
with distorted eyes then slumped for-
ward to be caught by the high priest
and carried from the room the ritual
was over all filed out with heads
hanging

jvtansfield whirled upon the old
fellow who sat with orbs fixed
upon the glass

  who are you what is this magic
with which you cower these men

  you are staring at ra-

  mansfield exclaimed bosh what
rascality are you up to here

  the spontaneous and impulsive stran-
ger never lost the whimsical smile on
the emaciated face

  you are a clever man sir john
mansfield no use deceiving you pray
sit down and refresh yourself by re-
laxing you are overwrought

  but mansfield was not to be forced
into a seat with demanding tone he
asked again who are you

  the eyes of the old man stared at
him eagerly looking right through him

  you demand sir john are you
really interested 

  mansfields breath was coming faster
now he couldnt diagnose that creepy
feeling which was quivering down his
spine he nodded his head

  those deep awfully deep eyes smiled
at him the bald head bent forward
i am cheops

chapter xviii

the flame of life

ouite a little while later sir
john mansfield fouiid himself
sitting in a chair with mouth
agape staring unbelievingly at the
amused countenance of the other

  cheops cheops the egyptian
king he murmured he died five
the lost city



thousand years ago this fellow must be
an imposter cheops there is no   
what is the matter with me anyway

  and indeed it seemed very probable
that he was out of his mind had he
been able to see his own face at that
moment he would have been alarmed
at its colorless pastiness he couldnt
shut his mouth it was ope wide enough
to stick two closed fists into it he
couldnt think straight

  an old bony arm extended toward
him come come my good man
pull yourself together

  the sound of the others voice did
more than anything else to wipe off that
impossible silliness mansfield took a
deep breath and glared around him
a burst of dismay of utter wonder
came from him right to the side of
him was a transparent wall through
which he could see the entire city of
atlantis and down below there issued
from the floor of the temple orderly
throngs of men and women they
were the ones who had left the chamber
of ra shortly before

  he didnt understand this where
he sat now was somewhere at the top
of the temple probably on the top
and he could look down and see every-
one the glass was in clear view of
those below yet not one of those heads
which occasionally glanced upward to
the top of the edifice ever showed sur-
prise or notice of it he mansfield
had taken in every line of the temple
when he had returned from the black
land beyond the man-eating plant and
he was positive that there had been noth-
ing like this above the holy building
it had been a blank wall at this point-
of that he was sure what miracle
was this

f i is roving mind clicked back to the
fellow who called himself cheops
he surveyed him from head to foot

he was the most shriveled living
mummy he had ever seen save for
those brilliant profound eyes which
were like a burbling pool of age-old
wisdom and lore he would hardly have
seemed to possess animation yet there
stood the paradox

  he whispered awedly tell me why
do you call yourself cheops are
you a descendant of the famous egyp-
tian dynasty of that name

  the fellow laughed-a metallic dead
sound

  no i am not a descendent i am
cheops the man who has lived almost
five thousand turns by that instrument
-he pointed near the wall and mansfield
saw a slowly revolving globe which re-
sembled the earth turning upon an
axis

  above it were suspended in the air
two balls of some metal which defied
gravity they also moved in impercep-
tible rotation

  the english scientist inspected it
closely while the old fellow continued
to explain the working of the instru-
ment the globe was girdled by a
strip of metal the same as that of which
the two balls which floated were com-
posed he could see that the orbits
were similar to those of the sun and
moon and that the earth turned once
fully to represent the passing of a day
three hundred and sixty-five turns in
one entire revolution designated a fully
completed year that much mansfield
discovered from the man who called
himself cheops the instrument was
a very ingenious piece but that could
wait it was this shrunken thing of a
human who interested him the most at
the moment

  he stared at him long speculatively
he was old but no man could live
that long cheops or anyone else there
were thousands of questions that he
wanted to ask to make the other talk


amazing stories

  about himself what was this that
seemed so elusively mysterious  he
didnt want to term him an absolute
liar without having the facts before
him and yet he wanted to believe this
man before him that strange feeling
which was rippling through him wasnt
without import he had felt it before
even though his mind wouldnt hold
faith or believe and he had found out
differently

 the old man seemed to read his
thoughts his eyes narrowed as if con-
centrating inwardly then he spoke

  i will tell you sir john mansfield

i	fully realize your puzzled and unbe-
lieving mien i am cheops the orig-
inal cheops rest your mind on that
point

  you found the papyrus manuscript
which i wrote ages ago thus you un-
derstand how i became acquainted with
the existence of atlantis but it was
more than that i found the men of
learning here to be so greatly developed
that my pithy scientists were but foolish
men in egypt i discovered that one
of them had concocted a flame which
would recreate the physical cells of the
human body without the necessity of
the subsistence upon food and water
that was the greatest creation of any
human mind it was the fountain of
eternal life but i shall show you
later   

  from the first glance into this ex-
traordinary land i completely for-
got my own i arranged finally to have
my supposed body buried in a tomb but
it was only that of a slave that neces-
sary passing wiped from the minds of
my people the life of cheops and that
was what i had wanted i had built in
the meantime many pyramids and mon-
uments so as to hide the true meaning
of the great sphigx you know its pur-
pose

  the men of atlantis-i speak of the
whites-are of much beneficence of mind
and heart so were their fathers they
accepted me as one of their own and
puttering around with their men of
science and seeing how i could live
forever i took in hand the formula of
the flame of life this abode i am
at present in can never be discovered
the matter which envelops it is of
transparent substance which yields to no
pressure none can look in or see it
it is so impenetrable but i within it
am not handicapped in any way by it
that is why you can see everything go-
ing on below and no one there will be
the wiser

  here look at the table before you
it is partitioned off into sections per-
ceive  those sections correspond to
every chamber in this temple and those
strips are the underground dungeons
and corridors i can communicate at
any time with any one of them simply
by moving this knob which brings it
to large relief in every room and cor-
ridor are placed tiny but superpowerful
bulbs which absorb every irradiation
both physical and inanimate they are
reflectors my voice is carried through
this tube here to each room through thin
slits in the four corners which are pow-
erful amplifying devices i will get you
the chamber of the high priest and
venia to explain to you the better

  his index finger fell upon a rectangu-
lar square in which were two moving
dots and he turned the knob near-by
immediately the square loomed large
and mansfield observed the chamber in
which he had first awakened in atlantis
saw the forms of venia and yuxa quite
distinctly

  the girl was standing over a table
listlessly yuxa was pacing the room
a sad expression upon his countenance
cheops turned another knob and spoke
into the tube instantly both the high
the lost city



priest and his daughter straightened and
lowered their heads in reverence grad-
ually the picture bulged until mansfield
felt that he could almost reach out and
touch the pair so close were they

  fear not cheops said to them sir
john mansfield is safe and contented
he shall speak to you

  the scientist took the speaking tube
eyes rapt upon the heaving breast of the
girl he spoke

  yuxa and venia be assured that
i am safe happy i am

  the girl whirled at the sound of his
voice and mansfield saw her big blue
eyes shine a beautiful smile upon her
lovely face the high priest relaxed
the lines in his face disappearing

  and then cheops turned the knob
again and the picture was shut off to
flicker down to two small moving dots
again

  do you see and believe and he
smiled at the stranger to atlantis

af ansfield felt a heavy weight
taken from him the sight of
the girl made him feel light and sus-
ceptible to anything nowr he began to
see what spell venia had put upon him
what yearning she had cast into his
hitherto impassive heart the stony heart
of an old and worldly scientist he
grinned at cheops youthfully

  the emaciated man continued as i
have told you already i do not need
food havent taken anything through
my mouth for thousands of years the
flame of life supplies everything for the
rnetabolistic progress of my body
mansfield dropped into the chair and
extended his legs with a sigh every-
thing had flashed upon him in meteoric
kaleidoscope and he hadnt had time to
digest them all he had discovered the
land of atlantis that in itself was a
finding that should eclipse everything
else but it was nothing compared to

the solution of the mystery of the rau-
cous voice no stretch of the imagina-
tion could ever have foreseen this

  for a long while he conversed with
cheops replying to the questions which
the other bombarded him with inces-
santly what the greatness was of the
people who lived now over the land-
scapes of the planet the forms of gov-
ernment the means of sustaining life
what the precious metal gold meant
as a medium of barter and exchange
the wireless the airplane cheops kept
shaking his head understanding them
not his brow creased enigmatically

  the withered man rudely interrupted
him by springing to his feet

  come it is time i must bathe in
the flame of life again

  mansfield rose trying to conceal his
eagerness his mind was exceptionally
clear now this was what he was wait-
ing for his scientific process of reason-
ing was back in full now he would
be able to see what this mastery of life
was whether this man really was
cheops it would corroborate his far-
fetched statements if they were true

  cheops touched a slightly elevated
spot and the transparent wall slid back
they were in a room which was very
small on the four sides were packed
four long metallic cones with covers upon
them the little man went to each and
threw back the cover a reddish sub-
stance was in them he caressed it with
a gentle hand

  this is my god there is none
other it gives me the power to live
as long as time it is my flame of
everlasting life

tte stood in the middle of the room

	and kicked a foot switch in-
stantly from the four sides there glowed
a strange efflorescence a cold light of
red and blue the radiation came to-

gether and suffused the small chamber
it was a scintillating blend

  cheops tore loose the girdle from his
body and fell into the very center of
the effluvia his body took on a bril-
liant color as though he were being
roasted alive but his eyes distended with
a sensual gratification an enjoyment of
every sensation known to man his arms
fell back his body limp and he hung
in the air quivering perceptibly

  to this day mansfield never knew
what happened to him he could never
describe the feelings which went through
him the only thing he remembered
after getting into the middle of the
room into the thick of the emanation
was that his eyes couldnt see anything
but that his body was feeling feeling
there surged through him a ripping of
something that he didnt mind in the
least and he wanted-oh so badly-to
just lie back and sleep on forever and
ever

 how long he was in this coma he
couldnt tell but there rose presently
to his senses a feeling of satiation and
he felt that he had had enough his
body was pliant as it had seldom if
ever been before it was as though he
had been dipped bodily into a mythical
fountain of youth and had had every
care and worry peeled off with a moth-
erly hand and touch

  his arms lifted with a flexibility that
was a joy he took a deep inhalation
that penetrated to the bottom of his
lungs a depth which he had never ex-
perienced it was profound this feeling

  he saw cheops at one side watching
him keenly the man wrapped his
girdle around him remarking

  you were in it for a long time your
young body will remember that refresh-
ment for years to come my old body
gathers the flame into it in a short time

  mansfield was now convinced that
fellow was cheops he couldnt deny

this reddish substance which had built
him up like this only as he gazed
upon the shrunken form he saw what
ages of the flame did to the body it
reduced it to a bony counterpart of what
it had once been

  lord if only such a thing were to
be had upon the earth think what it
would mean bodies worn and wasted
brought back to the freshness of youth
senility a thing unknown overcome and
banished the possibilities were amazing

  there was a new respect in his eyes
for the man who had lived longer than
any human being whose brain ceded not
to the ravages of that unconquerable es-
sence time

  they returned to the other room and
fell into a conversation that stocked the
scientists mind with many fine points
of an ancient civilization cheops was
amazed at the knowledge of the eng-
lishman concerning his people of egypt
sir john mansfield was getting his in-
formation now from a source which
would be the envy of the world of sci-
ence even he himself couldnt get
over the thrill-that he was speaking to
an ancient ruler of very much live pro-
portions of exceedingly clear and reten-
tive memory who was just as anxious to
narrate as to absorb he was chatting
with the famous cheops

  how was i brought up here  mans-
field asked suddenly

  through the golden throne in the
chamber of ra i created a smoky and
dense mist to envelop the chair so as to
prevent those watching from observing
the operation the legs of the chair are
rooted firmly into long rods these rods
forced the chair upward to the ceiling
the floor right here where a trapdoor is
opened then the throne is dropped
back while the mist is still thick so that
during the entire procedure nothing is
clear to the men of atlantis they could
see nothing because of the mist
the lost city



cheops seated himself at the glass-
topped table and studied the mov-
ing dots in the small squares he en-
gulfed himself completely in his task
knobbing every now and then some
square into prominence to perceive what
went on there

  mansfield sat at his side in silence
following each turn of the knob avidly
once during the long period as they
scanned the board cheops found some
reason to turn to the chamber of the
high priest and sir john mansfields
eyes discovered the girl and the father
at a table absorbing food while two
ebony blacks stood by stiffly there was
a far-away look on her face cheops
glanced at him with a smile

  mansfield watched the streets of at-
lantis through the transparent walls then
turned and asked

  why is it that no one has ever come
out of the great sphinx through the
same way that i came in by it would
be possible i think

  cheops shook his head no man of
atlantis will ever go forth through the
squatting god it cannot be done
mansfield felt something pull at him
at the statement an odd tremor stole
through him this strange wonder had
often interrogated him but what did
he mean by saying that no one could get
through the great sphinx why that
was the only way out of here

  no stated cheops there is no
chance there that final drop on the
cage-slab can only be worked from the
passage on top with the blade of the
knife but even if you might succeed
in getting up there there is no means
of opening the slab in the paw where
you entered it can only be operated
from the outside

 the knowledge came down upon
mansfield with a crash great heavens
why that-that meant that he couldnt
get out of this place that he was

destined to spend the rest of his days
in this underground abode and that
thought shut out everything else the
only thing that assuaged the terrible
emptiness rising within him was the
thought of venia it was the only salve
in this sudden predicament what good
would all this newly found knowledge
be if he were not able to make it known
to his own people to the world if he
had to live out the rest of his existence
here-and the thought of such a possi-
bility detracted much from the magnifi-
cence of atlantis-it would be a hollow
shell of a discover something which
is found and would be of great value
to everybody is of infinitesimal worth
when unattainable or concealed

  mansfield sat in his chair tried to
speak but could not

  however continued chedps there
is one place where it is possible to
emerge from atlantis-and mansfield
hung on to his breath-but there is
great danger of losing ones life there

  where is it-where is it precipi-
tated the englishman

  the erstwhile ra dropped his eyes
over the other i dont understand
your eagerness you are become one
of us now sir john mansfield it is
the chamber of the flowing water but
forget it you have seen what powers
i am imbued with thousands of years
are too long a time to be secluded how-
ever i desire human company and
i have chosen you my man how
would you like to go on living forever
and ever how would you like to ex-
perience the flame of life surging over
your body often it impresses you
does it not

  but mansfield never replied to that
question the shriveled man suddenly
leaped to his feet with a shriek and
pointed out beyond the city confines

  the man-eating wall the fixed

rays which control the matter are out

disaster

in a twinkling cheops had glued the
mouthpiece to his lips and was
roaring the news into every cham-
ber mansfield observing with fascina-
tion the squares before him saw the
stationary dots suddenly flit around like
flies there was a crazy movement on
the reflector table and looking out of
the invisible glass he saw men pouring
out of their domiciles and lugging cylin-
drical objects below the portals of the
temple were gushing forth hundreds of
men

  cheops roared to no one in partic-
ular what fools they have been
where were the guards those cylin-
ders will barely be able to cope with
that hideous mass

  did the mechanism break mansfield
asked

  no the blacks have destroyed them
those rays couldnt fail on their own
account what blasted minded creatures
the blacks are cant they realize that
the gray stuff eats black the same as
white they are doomed too

  it was clear now that gray matter
worked fast so fast that it would swal-
low dozens of men before the rays could
drive it back if there were two bodies of
men on either side of it and both di-
rected their cylinders at it at the same
time it could be held stationary until
the main rays were fixed again but
there was no great number of men of
course on the black habitat side only
a handful and those without ray tubes
the horrible grisly essence would eat
through them and once that fiendish
matter was uncontrollable man here
would be doomed cheops was right

  mansfield was activated he wanted
to do something not to sit up here and
watch the white peoples chances go
glimmering he must get down there
and direct the fighting quickly he
told cheops of his intentions cheops
listened strode to get at the mouthpiece
but mansfield grasped it

  no not that way i must be
down there with them i have to be
there

  for a second the ancient ruler hesi-
tated then acquiesced swiftly he ran
to the wall and pulled back a small
lever mansfield saw a trapdoor in the
floor open something was coming up
into it it was the golden throne from
the chamber of ra the chair was be-
ing hoisted into it by four long poles of
metal until the seat was half in the
room he threw himself into it held
tight to the arms and the last sight he
had of cheops was his face turned to
the glass walls as he hurriedly pulled
back the lever

  even before the golden throne had
reached the floor he had tossed himself
to the rugged ground and was streaking
for the entrance out in the corridor a
few men were making mad dashes down-
ward practically everybody had already
gone

  he raced speedily to the chamber of
the high priest and found it empty
yuxa and venia were somewhere below
without a moments hesitation he flew
downward pacing in large strides he
overtook some laggards left them far
behind paying no attention to their
startled glances at his presence

  out in the city he ran from the
door of the temple men were still mill-
ing onward his eye swept the scene
and he grew angry

  what fools they are why dont
they do this systematically they are
all rushing into its horrible jaws

  but hundreds of men had seen him
the lost cm



they pointed at him gesticulated with
a surprised array of faces from some-
where ahead mansfield saw a group
forcing itself back through the mob
when the men had got into the clear
he found that they were hurrying
toward him yelling it was yuxa and
his official heads the men of learning
and the other dignitaries and venia
was with them

  mansfield gave them no time to ask
him questions

  get all the men lined up quick
against the edge of the city have
them point their cylinders directly at
the ground in front of them pay no
attention to the gray stuff there must
be a wall of rays packed tightly to-
gether so that not one inch of the
growth can get through

yuxa flashed the order venia came
to his side and mansfield held her
arm looking into her face there was
no fear in her a resolute mouth and
brave eyes she had the utmost con-
fidence in him

  up ahead the yelling frantic voices
had subsided somewhat and a more or-
derly tone was to be perceived men
lined up without a qualm now and
threw the emanation from their tubes
directly before them rays were cast
at a broad front from every angle to
permit no minute avenue of seepage

  and then several men scurried up
with panting breath from the rear

  the blacks have broken a tunnel
through to the dungeons and are coming
upward they are destroying every-
thing 

  the news left everybody agape all
the man strength was needed to fight
the deadly matter there could be no
attention paid to the blacks and the
crafty minds of the ebony creatures
had figured that out they had broken
the rays mechanism to get the whites

all up above then they had crashed
through with their strategic blow

  but their strategy was awfully cor-
rect now mansfield told himself with a
shudder that man-eating wall needed
the most careful of attention if dis-
tracted the stuff would come right in
upon them all those hideous blacks
couldnt reason that far ahead

and at the verification of the black
attack from the rear which came
in the shape of howling demoniac ebon
bodies swinging clubs and cylinders
there was a furor in the ranks of the
white men many tore away from the
line which had been created to fight the
gray matter leaving gaping holes in the
bluish front into the oncoming black
mass they threw themselves

  mansfield drew venia clear back into
the shelter of the temple walls his
voice rose and fell trying to assemble
the men once again but his efforts fell
on deafened ears nobody heard him
everyone was busy protecting himself
from black swishing arms which were
inflicting terrible blows

  it was useless to stand here like this
and he couldnt do anything else mans-
field easily saw that doom was approach-
ing swiftly for all that seething un-
dulating mass of animal procreation was
rumbling on and on closer and closer
not a hundred yards away from the
citys edge a groan burst from his
lips

  he whirled on the girl its all over
venia we can do nothing the heart-
less blacks couldnt see this far ahead
the damnable inhuman creatures

  the girl wrapped her arms about him
and held him tight over her shoulder
mansfield eyed the slowly slobbering
mass which would soon shroud them all
with its incomprehensible composition
well he groaned again if it did it
would take two bodies right here at

one eating he was not going to re-
lease venia

  and then a thought came to him and
he stood erect gazing into the face of
the girl why hadnt he thought of it
before this place was doomed to ex-
tinction now but there might be some
way to save venia and himself if they
worked fast

  he asked quickly where is the cham-
ber of the flowing water

  the girl didnt understand flow-
ing water

  he waxed more anxious is there
any chamber where there is water lots
of it anything like that

  iler eyes opened you mean-where
our water supply comes from

  thats the one he exulted come
how do we get there once more his
eyes swept the fray which was growing
wilder and wilder and once more he
saw that the mass of gray would be
upon them with gorging intent in a short
while nothing nothing could be done

  i was there but once in my life sir
john but i think i know the way
turning she dived into the temple
mansfield was upon her heels and ran
swiftly to a level corridor where she
breathlessly pressed open a panel he
saw that it was one of the magnetic
vehicles they rushed into the car and
closed the door just as a huge black
came bounding upon the platform after
them

                                                              - -p- -  

r t is club crashed against the closed
door and knocked it half open
but in the split interim venia had waved
her hand over the glowing tube and the
car moved away with a jerk between
the large circular rings the black
stumbled on the edge of the platform
couldnt regain his equilibrium and fell
head foremost down on the road-bed
of the carrier

  why do you want to go to the flow-

ing water below it is a nice place in
which to conceal ourselves but we will
be found in the end the girl was
looking at him queerly

  he knew what she was thinking he
the strong man who performed miracles
was running away and hiding but he
laughed causing the beautiful eyes to
raise in question he grasped her blonde
head in both hands   

  how would you like to go to my
land venia

  the girl stared you-you mean-

  he kissed her brow fervently you
dear creature somewhere below is the
only exit from atlantis and im going
to find it will you go with me

  a sudden sob fell from the girl she
looked backward toward the land which
had reared her and her eyes welled
it was clear to her now if sir john
mansfield said that atlantis was doomed
it was conclusive in the rear were her
father and the ones she loved they-
they were going down to ruin-to ruin

  i go whispered the soft voice with
a break

  the vehicle rushed downward at a
tremendous speed suddenly they were
thrown against the wall as it stopped
abruptly permitting another car to pass
their front the intersection showed a
vehicle ahead which was packed full with
ferocious blacks quarreling among them-
selves but they caught sight of the
huddled pair and in an instant were
turning their car around to follow them

  the girl was watching the other move
carefully she waved her hand upon
the shining bulb and pressed a knob it
sent them shooting downward again at
a speed that caused them to hold tight
to the rings in the sides but from be-
hind came the roused voices of their
pursuers breaking through the silence
of the speeding vehicles

  we are almost there sir john hold
the door open wvre going to stop
the lost city



suddenly both of us will fall out i
am going to turn this knob and throw-
off the power control that will throw
theirs off too and theyll crash into
us with their momentum

the conveyance came abreast of a
long row of underground chambers
and mansfield snatched out his revolver
and spun the chambers all of them
were holding used shells he felt his
belt and shook his head with a grimace
there were only four cartridges on him
the rest had been fired or had been
torn loose from the belt he quickly
inserted the four last

  suddenly the girl snapped back the
knob and they leaped through the door
upon a platform the car had come to
an instant standstill and not fifty feet
away whizzed the one with the blacks
a frantic black was pushing back the
control knob to no avail

  the fleeing pair were through the
door of a large chamber when there
came the splintering crash of both ve-
hicles metal and glass flew in all direc-
tions groans and shrieks split the air
bodies were hurtling crazily to crash
sickeningly into unyielding obstacles

  the noise of the smash died away
the flying pieces of metal floundered
against the underground walls not a
black raised his head

the plowing water

the englishman perceived imme-
diately how the water supply was
attained there was a rushing
subterranean stream eddying through the
deep stone walls which rose to join
the floor of the chamber mansfield fell
at the edge and peered over but saw
nothing other than the moving water

the walls were bare and solid the

only opening was the one they had
come through he looked at the girl
meditatively was cheops telling him
the truth when he said that the chamber
of the flowing water was the only exit
from atlantis it didnt seem to be
now that he was here the walls could
be seen to lead nowhere his heart sank
at the thought that he might have been
duped by the emaciated old fellow this
chamber wasnt an outlet but as perfect
a trap as could be gotten into

  are you sure there is no other cham-
ber where there is water he asked the
girl

  she shook her head see those long
pointed tubes they carry the water up
to the city they have always done it

  there was nothing for him to do now
but to inspect the walls in the hope that
a hollow ring would reveal a hidden en-
trance with the butt of his gun he
went around and sounded them no
echoing reverberation came to his expec-
tant ears the girl watched him circling
the chamber with anxious eyes

  presently he gave up in disgust strode
to the rim of the floor and stared down
at the stream his fingers went care-
fully around the edge but failed in dis-
closing anything

  the girl ran to the entrance and
gasped mansfield hurried toward her
coming down the road-bed was a score
of blacks and as they caught sight of
the pair they screamed with delight
voices shrieked the glee that at last the
stranger was in their hands that the
daughter of the high priest was theirs
for the taking

  mansfield drew the girl into the cham-
ber behind him his mouth was fixed
his face taut for the first time he
feared the outcome of a struggle with
only four bullets available against a
howling horde that was rushing pell-mell
upon them and this chamber of the
underground stream the trap that it was


amazing stories

no hope presented itself from any view-
point

  the blacks climbed upon the braces of
the framework and leaped to the plat-
form mansfield took deliberate aim
and fired at the first fellow to show his
head the black threw up his clawing
hands and toppled over

ut it didnt stall the others for
once the sound of the gun held no
terror for them they were maniacally
worked up sanity was gone all they
desired was the feel of the white bodies
in their ripping hands they wanted to
tear and crush and kill-kill nothing
else would satisfy their slavering jowls
now

  again and again mansfield fired into
their midst forcing a momentary halt
then the gun clicked upon an empty
shell the weapon was of no value to
him now the blacks rushed through
the opening

  the attack forced the man and the
girl back to the very edge of the stream
he saw venia glance at him with fear
in her drawn eyes then she tottered
on the brink and fell headmost into the
turbulent river

  his mind went blank with a hor-
rible cry he flung the gun into the face
of the nearest black like a madman
he fought the hideous faces-clawed and
tore his bloody fist ached from the
crunch of ebony visages they piled in
on top of him swinging their clubs to
get a fatal blow in effectually

  and then a club crashed against his
breast and it knocked him backward
he went pitching over the edge to splash
bodily into the stream

  the water closed over his head and
open mouth and when he came to the
top after a while sputtering and cough-
ing he felt as though he must have
swallowed the whole river the water
was lukewarm his eyes opened but

he could see nothing for the total black-
ness which engulfed the place

 his anxiety was for venia he
doubted much whether she could swim
whether anyone in atlantis could swim
at no time had she seen a large body
of water

  the current was swift and it carried
him on making useless his attempt to
use a powerful stroke he wondered
where the girl was with reaching arms
he felt around him as he was being swept
onward hoping that he might come in
contact with her but nothing but
water filtered through his fingers
only when he reached upward did he
feel his finger-tips brush against a
smooth polished rock and he knew it
was the roof of this watery passage
every moment he waited for that final
surge which would send him crashing
into something which would dash his
brains out

  he couldnt believe for a moment that
this was the egress which cheops had
spoken of that only through this could
one find his way out of atlantis

  he raised his voice loudly the wall
just over his head throwing back his
roar with a deafening sound suddenly
a thrill went through him was it his
own voice that echoed so faintly he
thought not

  time after time he felt his strength
giving out his arms rasped against an
eroded wall with such force that they
were aching terribly but he wasnt go-
ing to give in to this onrushing torrent
maybe it was the thought of a watery
grave that gave him courage and he
detested a demise of such nature

  he yelled again and was certain that
the echo wasnt of his making he was
sure that the girl was still living his
chilled throat burst into another shout

  venia he yelled

  a sound came from near him-a gasp-
ing coughing noise-but once again the
the lost city



drag beneath the waters occupied his
mind when he came up again his voice
was too spent to raise in a shout and
his lungs were fighting for breath the
loathsome watery grave was beginning
to loom fearfully close his arms were
heavy weights he felt himself slipping

  there must be some end to this steady
river it couldnt go on and on and on
underneath the earth without emerging
somewhere if it did-well his numbed
mind knew the answer his hody fought
the swirling swishing water knew that
if something did not happen soon it
would be all over with him he wasnt
superhuman he had been fortunate in
surviving this long

  and thinking of that sent a more icy
chill through his veins without a doubt
venia had succumbed she couldnt have
survived this whirling water this long
he was almost on the verge of going
down for the last time himself

  if only there were some light the
ghastly blackness didnt help him any
it only made the rising bumps on his
head much larger as a surge carried
him with force against the roof

  there came a magical change in light
just then his eyes were blinded by a
severe whiteness that burned deeply into
his retina his hand flung feebly up-
ward but there was no roof there this
time to tear his skin to pieces his
heart leaped

  he opened his eyes and-a deep cry
fell from his lips god the sun was
shining right into his eyes what a
feeling

ouickly his eyes became used to
the light and he sent scouring
glances about him he was in the mid-
dle of a small river then he became
galvanized into action all fatigue and
tiredness had vanished his roving eyes
had caught sight of a form in the water
a short distance away

  it was a blonde dripping head which
flashed under the glistening sun a
voluntary movement of a hand it was
venia and she was alive

  no eddy in the world could have held
him back now his stroke carried him
through the water in such strides that
an onlooker on the shore would have
rubbed his eyes and looked again at the
miracle he reached her just as she
was going down her eyes looked at him
glazedly

  he must get her to the shore imme-
diately and with that intention por-
poised toward the nearest bank the girl
held gently yet securely

  he lifted her clear out of the water
and laid her upon the sandy shore un-
mindful he was of the condition he was
in his experienced hands forced out
the water from her lungs her eyes
opened presently and recognized him
with a sweet smile sir john mansfield
raised a glowing face to the sovereign
of the heavens lolling along in his fiery
chariot and blinked

epilogue

almost six years have passed
six years redundant of heart-
aches and jubilation six years
in which one eminent archaeologist sir
john mansfield knew the degree of ridi-
cule and scorn appreciated the fullness
of abounding happiness and that joy
obscured everything else in the end

  venia was very much affected by the
sun and the changing climates of the
earth for a long year when sir john
mansfield came out of that hospital on
that december evening with the assur-
ance that she would live he threw up
his arms in silent prayer of gratitude
he knew then what the girl meant to
him


amazing stories

  the word of the famous scientist
had always been fraught with authen-
ticity and fact but when he revealed
the narrative of his experience from the
first moment of encountering horda el
a brim and the renegade white in el
kasr to the emerging from atlantis
through the underground stream he was
beset by a volume of hooting and dis-
belief that even unto a heart such as
his it created a fierce dislike for his
fellow colleagues

 they demanded the manuscript of
cheops but alas the hotel in cairo
in which he had put his papyrus evi-
dence for safekeeping had burned to the
ground and the manager had perished
inthe flames it was never found

  hoping that the egyptian government
might lend an attentive ear he turned
to them reluctantly it sent a commit-
tee to the great sphinx and when re-
peated insertions of a blade failed to
bring forth the awaited reverberation
they shrugged their shoulders but
mansfield begged them to break down
that massive slab in the paw even if
they might not succeed in reaching at-
lantis there was that fabulous fortune
to be attained in the vault where all
of those gorgeous and priceless carvings
were the committee laughed in his
face what break down the age-old
sphinx to satisfy a whim  and a rather
-how might it be termed-unbalanced
whim 

mansfield fumed at the dunder-
heads then turned abruptly from
them holding back his rage if that
was the way the world of science ac-
cepted what was probably the greatest

discovery of any age-well then the
blockheads could go on following their
noses he was through with all of
them

  he withdrew from every activity even
from the university his sole delight
now was to sit before the fire with
venia in his arms and recount those
happenings of not so very long ago
every night they asked themselves
whether atlantis had really perished
and it seemed so for several ensuing
summers they had tried to open the slab
of the great sphinx but there was no
movement it spelt the complete wiping
out of the race below there was no
one apparently to operate the mech-
anism that controlled the sphinx

  and that flame of life of cheops
what a thing that would mean to the
world above but that too was gone
nowt buried under that uncontrollable
man-eating organism yuxa cheops
all of them had been subdued into a
nothingness it was a bitter thought
to these two

  but when they gaze upon that golden-
haired lad who plays at their feet look-
ing like the young demigod he really is
in the eyes of his parents their joy
knows no bounds he is compensation
enough for the bitterness which has
assailed the famous scientist and his
wife the sorrow that was forced upon
them

  and when his honest and frank eyes
of blue glance upward toward them
they hold each other more tightly and
ask the benign hand to guard and
protect him to keep him from all evil
he is their happiness they live for
him

serial in four parts-part iii

 we are now approaching toward the end of the story of the measurement of
 the meridian it is a study of geodesy and the data which the distinguished
 author has given we would strongly advise our readers to follow out and
 they will be surprised at the amount of information that has been embodied

what has gone before

 a party of scientists some russian and some english before the crimean war of 
 go to africa to measure on its extended plains a segment of a meridian of the earth in
 order to determine its true circumference some of the party are at the beginning of
 the line which is to be measured and are awaiting the arrival of a steamboat carrying much
 of their equipment and other members which at last comes up the river the boat is made
 to be knocked down so that it can he put in pieces upon ox wagons and be taken from river
 to river or lake we are told of the different attempts to measure a meridian the details of
 which are of much interest as presented by our author especially does he mention the
 meridian from the balearic islands to dunkirk on the british channel this we are told is
 especially interesting because its termini are so located that the slight departure of the earth
 from true sphericity is automatically corrected one of the party sir john is a great hunter
 and we are told of his successes among the great forms of african game and we are to hear
 more about it in the latter part of the story

     the party being bi-national-some russian some english-and the impending crimean
 war does not improve their relations they select a starting point for their first triangle for
 the measurements of the arm is based on a consecutive series of triangles and the work of
 the astronomers progresses while the big game keeps the hunters busy the killing of an
 elephant is one of the episodes described and an attack on their canoe by a hippopotamus
 jealousy and ill-feeling between the two nationalities is intensified the great mathematician
 nicholas palander is lost and found he is too absent-minded for the wilderness next comes
 a battle with lions an impenetrable forest checks progress as the measurement of the second
 degree is completed a passage way is obtained by burning the trees and underbrush in a
 forest fire after completing the third degree of longitude a mail from home reaches them
 and they read of the war of  between england and her allies and russia the party
 divides and prepare to carry out two lines of survey the russians get the steamboat a
 rhinoceros is killed and sir john the english hunter loses a wager with the native guide
 makoam and now trouble with the natives threatens

a meridian



something more than half tte proj-
ect was now accomplished and whatever
happened the english owed it to them-
selves and their country not to abandon
their undertaking the series of triangles
was resumed on the th the tropic of
capricorn was passed and on the rd
of november with the completion of the
forty-first triangle a fifth degree was
added to the meridian

  for a month the survey went on
rapidly without meeting a single natur-
al obstacle mokoum always on the
alert kept a constant lookout at the head
and flanks of the caravan and forbade
the hunters to venture too great a distance
away no immediate danger however
seemed to threaten the little troop and
they were sanguine that the bushmans
fears might prove groundless there
was no further trace of the native who
after eluding them at the cromlech had
taken so strange a part in the oryx
chase nor did any other aggressor ap-
pear still at various intervals the
bushman observed signs of trepidation
among the bochjesinen under his com-
mand the incident of the flight from
the old cromlech and the stratagem of
the oryx hunt could not be concealed
from them and they were perpetually
expecting an attack a deadly antipathy
existed between tribe and tribe and in
the event of a collision the defeated
party could entertain no hope of mercy
the bochjesman were already  miles
from their home and there was every
prospect of their being carried  more
it is true that before engaging them
mokoum had been careful to inform
them of the length and difficulties of
the journey and they were not men to
shrink from fatigue but now when to
these was added the danger of a conflict
with implacable enemies regret was
mingled with murmuring and dissatis-
faction was exhibited with ill-humor and
although mokoum pretended neither to

hear nor see he was silently conscious
of an increasing anxiety

  on the d of december a circumstance
occurred which still further increased the
spirit of complaint among this super-
stitious people and provoked them to
a kind of rebellion since the previous
evening the weather had become dull
the atmosphere saturated with vapor
gave signs of being heavily charged with
electric fluid there was every prospect
of the recurrence of one of the storms
which in this tropical district are seldom
otherwise than violent during the
morning the sky becamc covcred with
sinister-looking clouds piled together
like bales of down of contrasted colors
the yellowish hue distinctly relieving the
masses of dark gray the sun was wan
the heat was overpowering and the
barometer fell rapidly the air was so
still that not a leaf fluttered

  although the astronomers had not
been unconscious of the change of
weather they had not thought it neces-
sary to suspend their labors emery
attended by two sailors and four natives
in charge of a wagon was sent two
miles east of the meridian to establish
a post for the vertex of the next tri-
angle he was occupied in securing
his point of sight when a current of
cold air caused a rapid condensation
which appeared to contribute immediately
to a development of electric matter in-
stantly there fell a violent shower of
hail and by a rare phenomenon the
hailstones were luminous so that it
seemed to be raining drops of boiling
silver the storm increased sparks
flashed from the ground and jets of
light gleamed from the iron settings of
the wagon dr livingstone relates that
he has seen tiles broken and horses and
antelopes killed by the violence of these
hail-storms

  without losing a moment emery left
his work for the purpose of calling his


amazing stories

men to the wagon which would afford
better shelter than a tree but he had
hardly left the top of the hill when a
dazzling flash instantly followed by a
peal of thunder inflamed the air

 emery was thrown down and lay
prostrate as though he was actually
dead the two sailors dazzled for a
moment were not long in rushing to-
ward him and were relieved to find
that the thunderbolt had spared him he
had been enveloped by the fluid which
collected by the compass which he held
in his hand had been diverted in its
course so as to leave him not seriously
injured raised by the sailors he soon
came to himself but he had narrowly
escaped two natives twenty paces
apart lay lifeless at the foot of the
post one had been struck by the full
force of the thunderbolt and was a black
and shattered corpse while his clothes
remained entire the other had been
locally struck on the skull by the de-
structive fluid and had been killed at
once the three men had been un-
deniably struck by a single flash this
trisection of a flash of lightning is an
unusual but not unknown occurrence
and the angular division was very large
the bochjesmen were at first over-
whelmed by the sudden death of their
comrades but soon in spite of the cries
of the sailors and at the risk of being
struck themselves they rushed back to
the camp the two sailors having first
provided for the protection of emery
conveyed the two dead bodies to the
wagon and then found shelter for
themselves being sorely bruised by the
hailstones which fell like a shower of
marbles for three-quarters of an hour
the storm continued to rage the hail
then abated so as to allow the wagon to
return to camp

  the news of the death of the natives
had preceded them and had produced
a deplorable effect on the minds of the

bochjes nen who already looked upon
the trigonometrical operations with the
terror of superstition they assembled
in secret council and some more timid
than the rest declared they would go no
farther the rebellious disposition be-
gan to look serious and it took all the
bushmans influence to arrest an actual
revolt colonel everest offered the poor
men an increase of pay but content-
ment was not to be restored without
much trouble it was a matter of emer-
gency  had the natives deserted the posi-
tion of the caravan without escort and
without drivers would have been peril-
ous in the extreme at length however
the difficulty was overcome and after
the burial of the natives the camp was
raised and the little troop proceeded to
the hill where the two had met their
death

  emery felt the shock for some days
his left hand which had held the com-
pass was almost paralyzed but after a
time it recovered and he was able to
resume his work

  for eighteen days no special incident
occurred the makololos did not ap-
pear and mokoum though still distrust-
ful exhibited fewer indications of alarm
they were not more than fifty miles
from the desert and the karroo was still
verdant and enriched by abundant water
they thought that neither man nor beast
could want for anything in this region
so rich in game and pasturage but they
had reckoned without the locusts against
whose appearance there is no security in
the agricultural districts of south africa

  on the evening of the th about an
hour before sunset the camp was ar-
ranged for the night a light north-
erly breeze refreshed the atmosphere
the three englishmen and mokoum
resting at the foot of a tree discussed
their plans for the future it was ar-
ranged that during the night the astron-
omers should take the altitude of some

stars in order accurately to find their
latitude every thing seemed favorable
for the operations in a cloudless sky
the moon was nearly new and the con-
stellations might be expected to be clear
and resplendent great was the disap-
pointment therefore when emery ris-
ing and pointing to the north said
the horizon is overcast i begin to
fear our anticipations of a fine night will
hardly be verified

yes replied sir john i see a
cloud is rising and if the wind should
freshen it might overspread the sky
there is not another storm coming
i hope interposed the colonel

  we are in the tropics said emery
and it would not be surprising for to-
night i begin to have misgivings about
our observations

  what is your opinion mokoum
asked the colonel of the bushman

  mokoum looked attentively toward the
north the cloud was bounded by a
long clear curve as definite as though
traced by a pair of compasses it marked
off a section of some miles on the
horizon and its appearance black as
smoke seemed to excite apprehensions
of the bushman at times it reflected a
reddish light from the setting sun as
though it were rather a solid mass than
any collection of vapor without direct
reply to the colonels appeal mokoum
simply said that it was strange

  in a few minutes one of the bochjes-
men announced that the horses and cat-
tle showed signs of agitation and would
not be driven to the interior of the
camp

  well let them stay outside said
mokoum and in answer to the sug-
gestion that there would be danger from
the wild beasts around he added sig-
nificantly oh the wild beasts will be
too much occupied to pay any attention
to them

after the native had gone back colo-

nel everest turned to ask what the bush-
man meant but he had moved away and
was absorbed in watching the advance
of the cloud of which too accurately he
was aware of the origin

  the dark mass approached it hung
low and appeared to be but a few hun-
dred feet from the ground mingling
with the sound of the wind was heard
a peculiar rustling which seemed to
proceed from the cloud itself at this
moment above the cloud against the sky
appeared thousands of black specks flut-
tering up and down plunging in and
out and breaking the distinctness of the
outline

  what are those moving specks of
black asked sir john

  they are vultures eagles falcons
and kites answered mokoum from
afar they have followed the cloud and
will never leave it until it is destroyed
or dispersed

  but the cloud

  is not a cloud at all answered the
bushman extending his hand toward the
somber mass which by this time had
spread over a quarter of the sky it
is a living host to say the truth it is
a swarm of locusts

  the hunter was not mistaken the
europeans were about to witness one
of those terrible invasions of grass-
hoppers which are unhappily too fre-
quent and in one night change the most
fertile country into an arid desert these
locusts now arriving by millions were
the dread schistocerca of the naturalists
and travelers have seen for a distance
of fifty miles the beach covered with
piles of these insects to the height of
four feet

  yes continued the bushman these
living clouds are a true scourge to the
country and it will be lucky if we es-
cape without harm

  but we have no crops and pasturages


amazing stories

of our own said the colonel what
have we to fear

  nothing if they merely pass over
our heads everything if they settle on
the country over which we must travel
they will not leave a leaf on the trees
nor a blade of grass on the ground
and you forget colonel that if our
own sustenance is secure that of our
animals is not what do you suppose
will become of us in the middle of a
devastated district

  the astronomers were silent for a
time and contemplated the animated
mass before them the cries of the
eagles and falcons who were devouring
the insects by thousands sounded above
the redoubled murmur

  do you think they will settle here
said emery

  i fear so answered mokoum the
wind carries them here direct the sun
is setting and the fresh evening breeze
will bear them down should they settle
on the trees bushes and prairies why

then i tell you- but the bushman

could not finish his sentence in an in-
stant the enormous cloud which over-
shadowed them settled on the ground
nothing could be seen as far as the
horizon but the thickening mass the
camp was bestrewed wagons and tents
alike were veiled beneath the living hail
the englishmen moving knee-deep in
the insects crushed them by hundreds
at every step

  although there was  lack of agen-
cies at work for their destruction their
aggregate defied all check the birds
with hoarse cries darted down from
above and devoured them greedily from
below the snakes consumed them in
enormous quantities the horses buffa-
loes mules and dogs fed on them with
great relish and lions and hyenas ele-
phants and rhinoceroses swallowed them
down by bushels the very bochjes-
men welcomed these shrimps of the

air like celestial manna the insects
even preyed on each other but their
numbers still resisted all sources of de-
struction

  the bushman entreated the english to
taste the dainty thousands of young
locusts of a green color an inch to an
inch and a half long and about as thick
as a quill were caught before they
have deposited their eggs they are con-
sidered a great delicacy by connoisseurs
and are more tender than the old insects
which are of a yellowish tinge and
sometimes measure some inches in length
after a half an hours boiling and sea-
soning with salt pepper and vinegar the
bushmen served up a tempting dish to the
three englishmen the insects dismem-
bered of head legs and skin were eaten
just like shrimps and were found ex-
tremely savory sir john who ate some
hundreds recommended his people to
take advantage of the opportunity to
make a large provision

  at night they were all about to seek
their usual beds but the interior of the
wagons had not escaped the invasion
it was impossible to enter without crush-
ing the locusts and to sleep under such
conditions was not an agreeable pros-
pect accordingly as the night was clear
and the stars bright the astronomers
were rejoiced to pursue their contem-
plated operations and deemed it more
pleasant than burying themselves to the
neck under a coverlet of locusts more-
over they would not have had a mo-
ments sleep on account of the howling
of the beasts which were attracted by
their unusual prey

  the next day the sun rose in a clear
horizon and commenced its course over
a brilliant sky foreboding heat a dull
rustling of wings among the locusts
showed that they were about to carry
their devastations elsewhere and toward
eight oclock the mass rose like the un-
furling of an immense veil and obsured
measuring a meridian



the sun it grew dusk as if night were
returning and with the freshening of
the wind the whole inass was in motion
for two hours with a deafening noise
the cloud passed over the darkened
camp and disappeared beyond the west-
ern horizon

  after their departure the bushmans
predictions were found to be entirely
realized all was demolished and the
soil was brown and bare every branch
was stripped to utter nakedness it was
like a sudden winter settling in the
height of summer or like the dropping
of a desert into the midst of a land of
plenty the oriental proverb which
describes the devastating fury of the
osmanlis might justly be applied to
these locusts where the turk has
passed the grass springs up no more

chapter xviii

desertion and reunion

it was indeed no better than a desert
which now lay before the travel-
ers when on the th of decem-
ber they completed the measurement of
another degree and reached the north-
ern boundary of the karroo they found
no difference between the district they
had been traversing and the new coun-
try the real desert arid and scorching
over which they were now about to pass
the animals belonging to the caravan
suffered greatly from the dearth alike of
pasturage and water the last drops of
rain in the pools had dried up and it
was an arid soil a mixture of clay and
sand very unfavorable to vegetation
the waters of the rainy season sunk
through the sandy strata so that the
region was incapable of preserving for
any length of time a particle of moisture
more than once has dr livingstone car-
ried his adventurous explorations across
one of these barren districts the very
atmosphere was so dry that iron left in

the open air did not rust and the dis-
tinguished traveler relates that the leaves
hung weak and shriveled that the mi-
mosas remained closed by day as well
as by night that the scarabsei laid on
the ground expired in a few seconds
and that the mercury in the ball of a
thermometer buried three inches in the
soil rose at midday to  fahrenheit

  these records which livingstone had
made were now verified by the astron-
omers between the karroo and lake
ngarni the suffering and fatigue espe-
cially of the animals continually in-
creased and the dry dusty grass afforded
them but little nourishment nothing
ventured on the desert the birds had
flown beyond the zambesi for fruit and
flowers and the wild beasts shunned the
plain which offered them no prey dur-
ing the first fortnight in january the
hunters caught sight of a few couples
of those antelopes which are able to ex-
ist without water for several weeks
there were some oryxes like those in
whose pursuit sir john had sustained
so great a disappointment and there
were besides some dappled soft-eyed
caamas which venture beyond the green
pasturages and which are much es-
teemed for the quality of their flesh

  to travel under that burning sun
through the stifling atmosphere to work
for days and nights in the oppressive
sultriness was fatiguing in the extreme
the reserve of water evaporated con-
tinuously so they were obliged to ra-
tion themselves to a painfully limited
allowance however such were their
zeal and courage that they mastered all
their troubles and not a single detail of
their task was neglected on the th
of january they completed their seventh
degree the number of triangles con-
structed having amounted to fifty-seven

  only a comparatively small portion
of the desert had now to be traversed
and the bushman thought that they


amazing stories

would be able to reach lake ngami be-
fore their provision was exhausted the
colonel and his companions thus had
definite hopes and were inspirited to
persevere but the hired bochjesmen
who knew nothing of any scientific
ardor and who had been long ago re-
luctant to pursue their journey could
hardly be encouraged to hold out un-
questionably they suffered greatly and
were objects for commiseration already
too some beasts of burden overcome
by hard work and scanty food had been
left behind and it was to be feared that
more would fall into the same helpless
condition mokoum had a difficult task
to perform and as murmurs and recrim-
inations increased his influence more
and more lost its weight it became ev-
ident that the want of water would be a
serious obstacle and that the expedi-
tion must either retrace its steps or at
the risk of meeting the russians turn to
the right of the meridian to seek some
of the villages which were known to be
scattered along livingstones route

  it was not long however before the
bushman one morning came to the col-
onel and declared himself powerless
against the increasing difficulties the
drivers he said refused to obey him
and there were continued scenes of in-
subordination in which all the natives
joined the colonel perfectly well un-
derstood the situation but stern to him-
self he was stern to others he refused
to suspend his operations and declared
that although he went alone he would
continue to advance his two compan-
ions of course agreed and professed
themselves ready to follow him re-
newed efforts of mokoum persuaded the
natives to venture a little further he
felt sure that the caravan could not be
more than five or six days march from
lake ngami and once there the an-
imals could find pasturage and shade
and the men an abundance of fresh wa-

ter all these considerations he laid
before the principal bochjesmen he
showed them that it was really best to
advance northward if they turned to
the west their march would be perilous
and to turn back was only to find the
karroo desolate and dry the natives at
length yielded to his solicitations and
the almost exhausted caravan continued
its course

  happily this vast plain was in itself
favorable to all astronomical observa-
tions so that no delay arose from any
natural obstruction on one occasion
there sprang up a sudden hope that na-
ture was about to restore to them a sup-
ply of the water of which she had been
so niggardly a lagoon a mile or two
in extent was discovered on the horizon
the reflection was indubitably of water
proving that what they saw was no
mirage due to the unequal density of the
atmospheric strata the caravan speed-
ily turned in that direction and the la-
goon was reached toward five in the
evening some of the horses broke
away from their drivers and galloped
to the longed-for water having smelt
it they plunged in to their chests but
almost immediately returned to the
bank they had not drunk and when
the bochjesmen arrived they found
themselves by the side of the lagoon so
impregnated with salt that its water
could not be touched disappointment
was keen it was little short of despair
mokoum thought that he should never
induce the natives to proceed but for-
tunately the only hope was in advancing
and even the natives were alive to the
conviction that lake ngami was the
nearest point where water could be pro-
cured in four days unless retarded
by its labors the expedition must reach
the shores of the lake

  every day was momentous to econ-
omize time colonel everest formed
larger triangles and established fewer
measuring a meridian



posts no efforts were spared to hurry
on the progress of the survey notwith-
standing the application of every energy
the painful sojourn in the desert was
prolonged and it was not until the st
of february that the level ground be-
gan to be rough and undulating a
mountain  or  feet high was
descried about fifteen miles to the north-
west the bushmen recognized it as
mount scorzef and pointing to the
north said

  lake ngami is there

  the ngami the ngami echoed the
natives with noisy demonstration they
wished to hurry on in advance over the
fifteen miles but mokoum restrained
them asserting that the country was in-
fested by makololos and that it was im-
portant to keep together colonel ev-
erest himself eager to reach the lake
resolved to connect by a single triangle
the station he was now occupying with
mount scorzef the instruments were
therefore arranged and the angle of the
last triangle which had been already
measured from the south was measured
again from the station mokoum in his
impatience only established a temporary
camp he hoped to reach the lake before
night but he neglected none of his usual
precautions and prudently sent out
horsemen right and left to explore the
underwood since the oryx-chase the
makololos seemed indeed to have aban-
doned their watch still he would not in-
cur any risk of being taken by surprise

  thus carefully guarded by the bush-
man the astronomers constructed their
triangle according to emerys calcu-
lations it would carry them nearly to the
twentieth parallel the proposed limit of
their arc a few more triangles on the
other side of lake ngami would com-
plete their eighth degree to verify the
calculations a new base would subse-
quently be measured directly on the
ground and the great enterprise would

be ended the ardor of the astron-
omers increased as they approached the
completion of their task

  meanwhile there was considerable
curiosity as to what the russians on
their side had accomplished for six
months the members of the commission
had been separated and it seemed pro-
bahle to the english that the russians
had not suffered so much from heat and
thirst since their course had lain near-
er livingtones route and therefore in
less arid regions after leaving kolo-
beng they would come across various
villages to the right of their meridian
where they could easily revictual their
caravan but still it was not unlikely
that in this less arid though more fre-
quented country mathew struxs little
band had been more exposed to the at-
tack of the plundering makololos and
this was the more probable since they
seemed to have abandoned the pursuit
of the english caravan

  although the colonel ever engrossed
had no thought to bestow on these
things sir john and emery had often
discussed the doings of their former
comrades they wondered whether they
would come across them again and
whether they would find that they had
obtained the same mathematical result
as themselves and whether the two
computations of a degree in south
africa would be identical emery did
not cease to entertain kind memories
of his friend knowing well that zorn
for his part would never forget him

  the measurement of the angles was
now resumed to obtain the angle at
the station they now occupied they had
to observe two points of sight one of
these was formed by the conical sum-
mit of mount scorzef and the other by
a sharp peak three or four miles to the
left of the meridian whose direction was
easily obtained by one of the telescopes
of the repeating circle mount scorzef


amazing stories

was much more distant its position
would compel the observers to diverge
considerably to the right of the meridian
but on examination they found they had
no other choice the station was there-
fore observed with the second telescope
of the repeating circle and the angular
distance between mount scorzef and the
smaller peak was obtained

  notwithstanding the impatience of the
natives colonel everest as calmly as
though he were in his own observatory
made many successive registries from
the graduated circle of his telescope and
then by taking the average of all his
readings he obtained a result rigorously
exact

  the day glided on and it was not
until the darkness prevented the reading
of the instruments that the colonel
brought his observations to an end say-
ing

 i am at your orders mokoum we
will start as soon as you like

  and none too soon replied mo-
koum  better had we accomplished our
journey by daylight

  the proposal to start met with unani-
mous approval and by seven oclock the
thirsty party were once more on the
march

 some strange foreboding seemed
weighing on the mind of mokoum and
he urged the three europeans to look
carefully to their rifles and to be well
provided with ammunition the night
grew dark the moon and stars were re-
peatedly veiled in mist but the atmos-
phere near the ground was clear the
bushmans keen vision was ever watch-
ing the flanks and front of the caravan
and his unwonted disquietude could not
fail to be noticed by sir john who was
likewise on the watch they toiled
through the weary evening occasionally
stopping to gather together the loiterers
and at ten oclock they were still six
miles from the lake the animals gasped

for breath in an atmosphere so dry that
the hygrometer could not have detected
a trace of moisture

  mokoum was indefatigable in his en-
deavors to keep the disorganized party
close together but in spite of his rem-
onstrances the caravan no longer pre-
sented a compact nucleus men and
beasts stretched out into a long file and
some oxen had sunk exhausted to the
ground the dismounted horsemen could
hardly drag themselves along and any
stragglers could have been easily carried
off by the smallest band of natives mo-
koum went in evident anxiety from one
to another and with word and gestures
tried to rally the troop and already
without his knowledge some of his men
were missing

  by eleven oclock the foremost wag-
ons were hardly more than three miles
from their destination in the gloom
of night mount scorzef stood out dis-
tinctly in its solitary height like an enor-
mous pyramid and the obscurity made
its dimensions appear greater than they
actually were unless mokoum were
mistaken lake ngami lay just behind
mount scorzef so that the caravan must
pass round its base in order to reach the
tract of fresh water by the shortest
route

  the bushmen in company with the
three europeans took the lead and pre-
pared to turn to the left when suddenly
some distinct though distant report ar-
rested their attention they reined in
their horses and listened with a natural
anxiety in a country where the natives
use only assegais and bows and ar-
rows the report of european firearms
was rather startling the colonel and
sir john simultaneously asked the bush-
man from whence the sound could pro-
ceed mokoum asserted that he could
perceive a light in the shadow at the
summit of mount scorzef and that he

   an assegai is a light spear used for throwing as
well as in close comhat
measuring a meridian



had no doubt that the makololos were
attacking a party of europeans
europeans cried emery

  yes replied mokoum these re-
ports can only be produced by european
weapons

  but what europeans could they be
began sir john be who they may
broke in the colonel we must go to
their assistance

  yes come on said emery with no
little excitement

  before starting off for the mountain
mokoum for the last time tried to
rally the small band but when the
bushman turned round the caravan was
dispersed the horses were unyoked the
wagons forsaken and a few scattered
shadows were flying along the plain to-
wards the south

  the cowards he cried then turn-
ing to the english he said well we
must go on

 the englishmen and the bushman
gathering up all the remaining strength
of their horses rode on to the north
after awhile they could plainly distin-
guish the war-cry of the makololos
whatever was their number it was ev-
ident they were making an attack on
mount scorzef from the summit of
which flashes of fire continued groups
of men could be faintly distinguished as-
cending the sides soon the colonel and
his companions were on the rear of
the besiegers abandoning their worn-
out steeds and shouting loud enough to
be heard by the besieged they fired at
the mass of natives the rapidity with
which they reloaded caused the mako-
lolos to imagine themselves assailed by
a large troop the sudden attack sur-
prised them and letting fly a shower of
arrows and assegais they retreated
without losing a moment the colonel
sir john emery mokoum and the
sailors never desisting from firing at-
tacked the group of natives of whose

bodies no less than fifteen soon strewed
the ground

  the makololos divided the euro-
peans rushed into the gap and overpow-
ering the foremost ascended the slope
backward in a few minutes they had
reached the summit which was now en-
tirely in darkness the besieged having
suspended their fire for fear of injuring
those who had come so opportunely to
their aid

  they were the russian astronomers
strux palander zorn and their five
sailors all were there but of all the na-
tives belonging to their caravan there
remained but the faithful pioneer the
bochjesmen had been as faithless to
them as they had been to the english

  the instant the colonel appeared
strux darted from the top of a low
wall that crowned the summit

  the english he cried

  yes replied the colonel gravely
but now neither russian nor english
nationalities must be forgotten for mu-
tual defense we are kinsmen in that
we are one and all europeans

chapter xix

success or death

noble words were those just
uttered by the colonel in the
face of the makololos it was no
time for hesitation or discussion and
english and russians forgetting their
national quarrel were now reunited
for mutual defense more firmly than
ever emery and zorn had warmly
greeted each other and the others had
sealed their new alliance with a grasp
of the hand

  the first care of the english was to
quench their thirst water drawn from
the lake was plentiful in the russian
camp then as soon as the makololos
were quiet enough to afford some re-

spite the astronomers sheltered by
a sort of casemate forming part of a
deserted fortress talked of all that had
happened since their separation at kolo-
beng

  it appeared that the same reason had
brought the russians so far to the left
of their meridian as had caused the
english to turn to the right of theirs
mount scorzef half way between the
two arcs was the only height in that dis-
trict which would serve as a station on
the banks of lake ngami each of
the meridians crossed the lake whose
opposite shores it was necessary to
unite trigonometrically by a large tri-
angle naturally therefore the two
rival expeditions met on the only moun-
tain which could serve their purpose

  matthew strux then gave some details
of his operations after leaving kolo-
beng the russian party had continued
without irregularity the old meridian
which had fallen by lot to the rus-
sians crossed a fertile and slightly un-
dulated country which offered every
facility for the triangulation like the
english they had suffered from the
heat but they had experienced no hard-
ship from the want of water streams
were abundant and kept up a wholesome
moisture the horses and oxen had
roamed over an immense pasturage
across verdant prairies broken by forests
and underwood the wild animals by
night had been safely kept at a distance
by sentinels and fires nor had any na-
tives been seen except those stationary
in the villages in which dr livingstone
had always found a hospitable recep-
tion all through the journey the boch-
jesmen of the caravan had given no
cause for complaint nor was it until the
previous day when the makololos to the
number of  or  had appeared on
the plain that they had shown them-
selves faithless and had deserted for

thirty-six hours the expedition had now
occupied the little fortress

  makololos had attacked them in the
evening after plundering the wagons
left at the foot of the hill the instru-
ments fortunately having been carried
into the fort were secure the steam-
boat had also escaped the ravages of the
natives it had been immediately put
together by the sailors and was now at
anchor in a little creek of lake ngami
behind the enormous rocks that formed
the base of the mountain mount
scorzef sloped with sudden abruptness
down to the lake and there was no dan-
ger of an attack from that side

  such was matthew struxs account
colonel everest in his turn related the
incidents of his march the fatigues and
difficulties and the revolt of the boch-
jesmen and it was found by comparison
that the russians had had a less harass-
ing journey than had their rivals

  the night of the st passed quietly
makoum and the sailors kept watch
under the walls for the fort the mako-
lolos on their part did not renew their
attack but the bivouac-fires at the foot
of the mountain proved that they had
not relinquished their project at day-
break the europeans left their casemate
for the purpose of reconnoitering the
plain the early morning light illumin-
ated the vast extent of country as far as
the horizon toward the south lay the
desert with its burnt brown grass and
barren aspect close under the moun-
tain was the circular camp containing
a party of  or  natives the fires
were still alight and some pieces of
game were broiling on the hot embers
the encampment was something more
than temporary the makololos were
evidently determined not to abandon
their prey either vengeance or an in-
stinctive thirst for blood appeared to be
prompting them since all the valuables
of both caravans the wagons horses
measuring a meridian



oxen and provisions had fallen into
their power or perhaps it might be that
they coveted the firearms which the
europeans carried and  of which such
terrible use has been made the united
english and russians held a long con-
sultation with the bushman and it was
felt that they could not relax their
watch until they should arrive at some
definite decision this decision must de-
pend on a variety of circumstances and
first of all it was necessary to understand
exactly the position of mount scorzcf

the mountain overlooked to the south
east and west the vast desert which the
astronomers having traversed it knew
extended southwards to the karroo in
the west could be discerned the faint
outlines of the hills bordering the fer-
tile country of the makololos one of
whose capitals maketo lies about a
hundred miles northwest of lake ngami
to the north the mountain commanded a
country which was a great contrast to
the arid steppes of the south there
were water trees and pasturage for a
hundred miles east and west lay the
long lake ngami while from north to
south its width was not more than 
to  miles beyond appeared a gentle
undulated country enriched with forests
and watered by the affluents of the zam-
besi and shut in to the extreme north
by a low chain of mountains this wild
oasis was caused by the great artery the
zambesi which is to south africa what
the danube is to europe or the amazon
to south america

  the side of the mountain toward the
lake steep as it was was not so steep
but that the sailors could accomplish an
ascent and descent by a narrow way
which passed from point to point they
thus contrived to reach the spot where
the queen and csar lay hid and obtain-
ing a supply of water enabled the lit-
tle garrison to hold out in the deserted
fort as long as their provisions lasted

  the astronomers wondered w-hy this
little fort had been placed on the top of
the mountain mokoum who had vis-
ited the country as livingstones guide
explained that formerly the neighbor-
hood of lake ngami was frequented by
traders in ivory and ebony the ivory
was furnished by the elephants and rhin-
osceroses but the ebony trade was but
too often another name for that traffic in
human beings which is still carried on
by the slave-traders in the region of the
zambesi a great number of prisoners
are made in the wars and pillages in the
interior of the country and these pris-
oners are sold as slaves mount scor-
zef had been a center of encampment for
the ivory-traders and it was there that
they had been accustomed to rest before
descending the zambesi they had for-
tified their position to protect themselves
and their slaves from depredations since
it was not an uncommon occurrence for
the prisoners to be recaptured for fresh
sale by the very men who had recently
sold them the route of the traders was
now changed they no longer passed the
shores of the lake and the little fort
was falling into ruins all that remained
was an inclosure in the form of the sec-
tor of a circle from the center of which
rose a small casemated redoubt pierced
with loop-holes and surmounted by a
small wooden turrent

  but notwithstanding the condition of
ruin into which it had fallen the fortress
offered the europeans a welcome re-
treat behind the thick sandstone wralls
and armed with their rapid-firing guns
they were confident that they could keep
back an army of makololos and unless
their provisions and ammunition failed
they would be able to complete their ob-
servations at present they had plenty
of ammunition the coffer in which it
was contained had been placed on the
same wagon which carried the steam-
boat and had therefore escaped the ra-


amazing stories

pacity of the natives the great diffi-
culty would be the possible failure of
provisions the colonel and strux made
a careful inspection of the store
and found that there was only enough to
last the eighteen men for two days
after a short breakfast the astronomers
and the bushman makoum leaving the
sailors still to keep watch around the
walls assembled in the redoubt to dis-
cuss their situation

  i cannot understand said mokoum
why you are so uneasy you say that
we have only provisions for two days
but why stay here let us leave to-mor-
row or even to-day the makololos
need not hinder us they could not cross
the lake and in the steamboat we may
reach the northern shore in a few
hours

  the astronomers looked at each other
the idea natural as it was had not struck
them before sir john was the first to
speak

  but we have not yet completed the
measurement of our meridian

  will the makololos have any regard
for your meridian asked the hunter

  very likely not answered sir john
but we have a regard for it and will
not leave our undertaking incomplete i
am sure my colleagues agree with me

  yes said the colonel speaking for
all as long as one of us survives and
is able to put his eye to his telescope
the survey shall go on if necessary we
will take our observations with our in-
struments in one hand and our guns in
the other even to the last extremity

  the energetic philosophers affirmed
their resolution to proceed at every haz-
ard

  when it was thus decided that the
survey should at all risks be continued
the question arose as to the choice of
the next station

  although there will be a difficulty
said strux in joining mount scorzef

trigonometrically with a station to the
north of the lake it not impracticable i
have fixed on a peak in the extreme
northeast so that the side of the tri-
angle will cross the lake obliquely
well said the colonel if the peak
exists i do not see any difficulty
the only difficulty replied strux
consists in the distance

  what is the distance

  over a hundred miles and a lighted
signal must be carried to the top of
the peak

  assuredly that can be done said
the colonel

  and all that time how are we to
defend ourselves against the makololos 
asked the bushman

  we will manage that too

  mokoum said that he would obey the
colonels orders and the conversation
ended the whole party left the case-
mate and strux pointed out the peak he
had chosen it was the conical peak
of volquiria  feet high and just
visible in the horizon notwithstand-
ing the distance a powerful reflector
could thence be discerned by means of a
magnifying telescope and the curvature
of the earths surface which strux had
taken into account would not be any
obstacle the real difficulty was how
the lamp should be carried to the top of
the mountain the angle made at
mount scorzef with mount volquiria
and the preceding station would com-
plete the measure of the meridian so
that the operation was all important
zorn and emery offered to take this
journey of a hundred miles in an un-
known country and accompanied by the
pioneer prepared to start

  one of the canoes which are manu-
factured by the natives with great dex-
terity would be sufficient to carry them
over the lake mokoum and the pioneer
descended to the shore where were grow-
ing some dwarf birches and in a short
measuring a meridian



time accomplished their task and pre-
pared the canoe

  at eight oclock in the evening the
newly constructed craft was loaded with
instruments the apparatus for the re-
flecting lamp provisions arms and am-
munition it was arranged that the
astronomers should meet again in a small
creek known to both mokoum and the
pioneer it was also agreed that as soon
as the light on mount volquiria should
be perceived colonel everest should
light a signal on mount scorzef so that
emery and zorn in their turn might
take the direction

  the young men took leave of their
colleagues and descended the mountain
in the obscurity of night having been
preceded by the pioneer and two sailors
one english and one russian the
mooring was loosened and the frail boat
started quietly across the lake

chapter xx

the siege

not without anxiety had the as-
tronomers witnessed the depar-
ture of their young colleagues
they could not tell what dangers awaited
them in that unknown country mo-
koum tried to reassure them by praising
the courage of the pioneer and besides
he said the makololos were too much
occupied around mount scorzef to beat
the country to the north of lake ngami
he instinctively felt that the colonel
and his party were in a more dangerous
position than the two young astronomers

  the sailors and mokoum kept watch
in turns through the night but the
reptiles as the bushman termed the
makololos did not venture another at-
tack they seemed to be waiting for
reinforcements in order to invade the

    lake ngami was of about  square miles area
it has now lost most of its water and has become a sort
of swamp

mountain irom all sides and overcome
by their numbers the resistance of the
besieged

  the hunter was not mistaken in his
conjectures and when daylight appeared
colonel everest perceived a sensible in-
crease in the number of the natives
their camps carefully arranged around
the base of the mountain shut off es-
cape on every side except that toward
the lake this side could not be in-
vested so that unless unforeseen cir-
cumstances occurred retreat to the wa-
ter was always practicable but the
europeans had no thought of escaping
they occupied a post of honor and were
all agreed that it must not be abandoned
no allusion was ever made to the war
between england and russia and both
parties strove together to accomplish
their scientific labor

  the interval of waiting for the signal
on mount volquiria was employed in
completing the measurement of the pre-
ceding triangle and in finding the ex-
act latitude of mount scorzef by means
of the altitude of the stars

  mokoum was called upon to say what
would be the shortest possible space of
time that must elapse before emery and
zorn could reach mount volquiria he
replied that as the journey was to be
performed on foot and the country was
continually crossed by rivers he did not
think that they could arrive in less than
five days at least they therefore
adopted a maximum of six days and
proportioned out their supplies to serve
for that period their reserve was very
limited consisting only of a few pounds
of biscuit preserved meat and perm-
mican and had already been diminished
by the portion furnished to the pioneers
little troop colonel everest and his
companions anxiously anticipating the
sixth day decided that the daily ration
must be reduced to a third of their pre-
vious allowance the thirteen men

would doubtless suffer much from this
small amount of nourishment but there
was an unflinching determination to bear
up bravely

  besides said sir john we have
room enough to hunt

  mokoum shook his head doubtfully
he thought that game would be rare on
the mountain however his gun need
not be idle and leaving the astronomers
to examine and correct their registers
he set off with sir john

  the makololos were quietly encamped
and apparently patient in their intention
of reducing the besieged by famine the
two hunters reconnoitered the moun-
tain the fort occupied a space of
ground measuring not more than a quar-
ter of a mile in its widest part the
soil was covered w-ith flints and grass
dotted here and there with low shrubs
and bright with gladioli red heaths
silvery-leaved protege and ericas with
wavy fronds formed the flora of the
mountain and beneath the angles formed
by the projections of rock sprung up
thorny bushes ten feet high with
bunches of a sweet-smelling white flow-
er the bushman was ignorant of its
name but it was doubtless the arduina
bispinosa which bears fruit like the bar-
berry

  after an hours search sir john had
seen no trace of game some little
birds with dark wings and red beaks
flew out of the bushes but at the first
shot they disappeared no more to re-
turn it was evident that the garrison
must not depend on the products of the
chase for sustenance

  we can fish in the lake said sir
john standing and contemplating the
fine extent of water

  to fish without net or line replied
the bushman is as difficult as to lay
hands on birds on the wing but we
will not despair chance has hitherto
favored us

  chance nay not chance but prov-
idence said sir john that does not
forsake us it has brought us to the
russians and will no doubt carry us on
to our goal

  and will providence feed us sir
john asked the bushman

  no doubt mokoum said sir john
encouragingly and the bushman thought
to himself that no blind trust in prov-
idence should prevent him from using
his own best exertions

  the th brought no change in the
relative positions of the beseigers and
the besieged the makololos having
brought in the plundered wagons re-
mained in their camps herds and flocks
were grazing in the pasturages at the
foot of the mountain and some women
and children who had joined the tribe
went about and pursued their ordinary
occupations from time to time some
chief recognizable by the richness of
the skins which he wore ascended the
slope of the mountain and tried to ex-
amine the approaches to the summit but
the report of a rifle always took him
speedily back to the plain the mak-
ololos then raised their war-cry bran-
dished their assegais and all became
quiet

  the following day the natives made
a more serious attempt and about fifty
of them at once scaled three sides of the
mountain the whole garrison turned
out to the foot of the enclosure and the
european arms caused considerable
ravage among the makololos five or
six were killed and the rest abandoned
their project but it was quite evident
that if several hundred were to assault
the mountain simultaneously the be-
sieged would find it difficult to face them
on all sides sir john now thought of
the mitrailleuse which was the principal
weapon of the queen and czar and pro-
posed that it should be brought up to
defend the front of the fortress it was
measuring a meridian



a difficult task to carry the machine up
the rocks which in some parts were al-
most perpendicular but the sailors
showed themselves so agile and daring
that in the course of the day the mit-
railleuse was installed in the embrasure
of the embattled enclosure thence its
twenty-five muzzles arranged in the
shape of a fan would cover the front
of the fort and the natives would thus
early make the acquaintance with the
engine of death which in after years was
to effect such devastation among the
civilized armies of the european con-
tinent

  the dry air and clear sky had enabled
the astronomers each night to pursue
their observation they had found the
latitude of mount scorzef to be 
 which result confirmed their opinion
that they were less than half a degree
from the northern extremity of their
meridian and that consequently the next
triangle would complete the series

  the night passed without any fresh
alarm if circumstances had favored the
pioneer he and his companions would
reach mount volquiria the following
day so that the astronomers kept un-
flagging watch through the next night
for the appearance of the light strux
and the colonel had already pointed the
telescope to the peak so that it was
continuously embraced in the field of
the object-glass otherwise it would have
been difficult to discern on a dark night
as it was the light would doubtless be
perceived immediately on its appearance

  all day sir john beat fruitlessly the
bushes and long grass he could not
unearth a single animal that was fit to
eat the very birds disturbed from
their retreats had gone to the underwood
on shore for shelter sir john was ex-
tremely vexed inasmuch as he was not
hunting merely for personal gratification
but to supply the necessities of the
party perhaps he himself suffered

from hunger more than his three col-
leagues whose attention was more en-
grossed in their application to science
the sailors and mokoum suffered equal-
ly with sir john one more day and
their scanty reserve would be at an end
and if the pioneers expedition were de-
layed they would soon be exposed to a
severe extremity of hunger

  the dark calm night was passed in
watching but the horizon remained
wrapped in shade and no light appeared
in the object-glass of the telescope the
minimum of time however allowed to
the expedition had hardly expired and
they felt that they were bound to exer-
cise patience for a while

  the next day the garrison ate their
last morsel of meat and biscuit but
their courage did not fail and though
they should be obliged to feed on what
herbs they could gather they were re-
solved to hold out

  the succeeding night passed without
any result more than once the as-
tronomers believed that they had seen
the light but it always proved to be a
star in the misty horizon

  on the st of march they were com-
pelled absolutely to fast having been
for some time accustomed to meager and
inadequate nourishment they passed the
first day without much acute suffering
but on the morrow they began to ex-
perience the pangs of craving sir john
and mokoum haggard-eyed and sen-
sitive to the gnawings of hunger wan-
dered over the top of the mountain but
no game whatever was to be seen they
began to think that as the colonel had
said they should literally have to feed
on grass if they unly had the stom-
achs of ruminants thought poor sir
john as he eyed the abundant pasturage
they would be able to hold out but still
no game still not even a bird he gazed
intently over the lake in which the
sailors had fished in vain and it was


amazing stories

impossible to get near the wary
aquatic birds that skimmed the tranquil
waters

  at last worn out with fatigue sir
john and his companion lay down on the
grass at the foot of a mound of earth
some five or six feet high here they
fell not precisely into a sleep but into a
heavy torpor which for a while be-
numbed their sufferings how long this
drowsiness would have lasted neither of
them could have said but in about an
hour sir john was aroused by a dis-
agreeable pricking he tried to slumber
again but the pricking continued and at
last impatiently he opened his eyes

  he was entirely covered face hands
and clothes with swarms of white ants
he started to his feet and his sudden
movement aroused the bushman who
was covered in the same way but to
sir johns great surprise the bushman
instead of shaking off the insects carried
them by handfuls to his mouth and de-
voured them greedily sir johns first
sensation was disgust at his voracity

  come eat do as i do said the
bushman it is the rice of the bochjes-
men

  and that was in truth the native
term for these insects the bochjesmen
feed on both the black and white species
but they consider the white to be of
superior quality the only drawback is
that they must be swallowed in large
quantities to satisfy any longing for
food the africans generally mix them
with the gum of the mimosa thus ren-
dering them capable of affording a more
substantial meal but as the mimosa did
not grow on mount scorzef the bush-
man had to content himself with his rice
an naturel

  sir john in spite of his repugnance
resolved to imitate him the insects
poured forth by thousands from their
enormous ant-hill which was none other
than the mound of earth by which the

weary sufferers had reclined sir john
took them by handfuls and carried them
to his lips he did not dislike the flavor
which was a grateful acid and gradually
he felt his hunger moderated

  mokoum did not forget his compan-
ions in misfortune he ran to the fort
and brought out the garrison the sail-
ors were without difficulty induced to at-
tack the singular food and although the
astronomers hesitated for a moment yet
encouraged by sir johns example and
half dead with inanition they soon at
least assuaged the intenseness of their
hunger by devouring considerable quan-
tities of these ants

  but an unexpected incident procured
for the starving men a more solid meal
in order to lay in a provision of the in-
sects mokoum resolved to destroy one
side of the enormous ant-hill it con-
sisted of a central conical mound with
smaller cones arranged at intervals
around its base the hunter had already
made several blows with his hatchet
when a singular grunting sound from
the center attracted his attention he
paused in his work of destruction and
listened while his companions watched
him in silence he struck a few more
blows and the groan was repeated more
audibly than before the bushman
rubbed his hands while his eyes evident-
ly sparkled once more attacking the
ant-hill he opened a cavity about a foot
wide the ants were escaping on every
side but of them he took no heed
leaving the sailors to collect them in
sacks all at once a strange animal ap-
peared at the mouth of the hole it
was a quadruped with a long snout a
small mouth and flexible tongue which
protruded to a great length its ears
were straight its legs short and its
tail long and pointed long gray bristles
with a reddish tinge covered its lank
body and its feet were armed with
enormous claws mokoum killed it at
measuring a meridian



once with a sharp blow on the snout
there is our supper he said it
has been some time coming but it will
not taste the worse for that now for
a fire and a ramrod for a spit and we
will feast as we have never feasted in
our lives

  the bushman speedily began to skin
the animal which was a species of eden-
tate an ant-eater very common in south
africa and known to the dutch at the
cape under the name of aardvark
swarms of ants are devoured by this
creature which catches them by means
of its long glutinous tongue

  the meal was soon cooked perhaps it
would have been better for a few more
turns of the spit but the hungry men
were impatient the firm wholesome
flesh was declared to be excellent al-
though slightly impregnated with the
acid of the ants

  after the repast the europeans felt
reinvigorated and animated with more
steadfast purpose to persevere and in
truth there was need of encouragement
all through the following night no light
appeared on mount volquiria

it was now the ninth day since zorn
and emery had started on their ex-
pedition their colleagues de-
tained on the summit of mount scorzef
began to give way to the fear that they
had fallen into some irretrievable mis-
fortune they were all well aware that
the young astronomers would omit noth-
ing that lay in their power to insure the
success of their enterprise and they
dreaded lest their courageous spirit
should have exposed them to danger or
betrayed them into the hands of the
wandering tribes they waited always
impatiently for the moment when the
sun sank behind the horizon that they
might begin their nightly watch and
then all their hopes seemed concentrated
on the field of their telescope

  all through the rd of march wan-
dering up and down the slopes hardly
exchanging a word they suffered as they
had never suffered before not even the
heat and fatigues of the desert nor the
tortures of thirst had equaled the pain
that arose from their apprehensions
the last morsel of the ant-eater had
been devoured and nothing now re-
mained but the ants

  night came dark and calm and ex-
tremely favorable to their operations
but although the colonel and strux
watched alternately with the utmost per-
severance no light appeared and the
suns rays soon rendered any longer
observations futile

  there was still nothing immediate to
fear from the makololos they seemed
resolved to reduce the besieged by fam-
ine and it seemed hardly likely they
would desist from their project the
unhappy europeans were tortured afresh
with hunger and could only dimin-
ish their sufferings by devouring the
bulbs of the gladioli from between the
rocks

  yet they were hardly prisoners their
detention was voluntary at any mo-
ment the steamboat would have carried
them to a fertile land where game and
fruit abounded several times they dis-
cussed the propriety of sending mokoum
to the northern shore to hunt for the
little garrison but this maneuver might
be discovered by the natives and there
would be a risk to the steamboat and
consequently to the whole party in the
event of finding other hostile tribes to
the north of the lake accordingly the
proposal was rejected and it was de-
cided that they must abide in com-
pany and that all or none must depart
to leave mount scorzef before the ob-
servations were complete was an idea
not entertained for a moment the as-
 tronomers were determined to wait until
the faintest hope should die

 beam transmission

by george h scheer jr

we are glad to present an interesting story by a new author the narration
is based partly on subconscious thought as it seemed although it was really
produced by an unsuspected intelligence and the results of it all lead to a
species of beam transmission with effects most extraordinary and interesting
the denouement is quite startling and is very well brought out in its detail

illustrated by morey

 -wve been wondering said pear-
  - son as the three of us sat
   smoking in my room after din-
  m ner just what all of this means

      unusual is not the word for it
at times i believe it is foolishness
and then again it seems most logical
to me said kroelich our instructor in
radio bell lets see those papers
again i handed him the sheets he in-
dicated most unusual he commented
as pearson and i looked over the older
mans shoulder at the figures on the
notebook leaves this is your third
awakening isnt it pearson and i each
have had two with more coming i sup-
pose i cannot help but connect these
things with our beam transmission ex-
periments in the laboratory last mon-
day each of us was awakened last
night lets see we calculated the fre-
quency to be very nearly eighteen mega-

came over us didnt we

son and i were doing for our masters
degrees in the university post graduate
school we had graduated in february
at the mid-term and thought it well to
continue our work until the end of the
semester in june pearson had spent
four years at the university while i

had had my credits transferred from
another and had come to madison to
finish my electrical engineering course
the two of us had met in kroelichs
classroom and decided to be laboratory
partners kroelich was pleased that we
were taking up advanced work for a
higher degree and spent most of his
free hours with us in our experiments
with beam transmission of ultra-radio-
frequencies we had experienced con-
siderable difficulty in reaching eighteen
megacycles due to spurious capacitances
in the wiring and tube sockets but we
were finally successful after a few mo-
ments during which time we were tak-
ing measurements to calculate the radia-
tion frequency the three of us felt a
sensation of numbness it seemed the
same as that produced by cold but it
did not exist in a degree great enough
to cause even partial paralysis kroe-
lich immediately cut the plate battery
supply switch thinking that we were
experiencing the results of an induced
fever commonly associated with high
frequency oscillations the numbness
subsided somewhat but dicf not leave us
entirely until late that evening

  my experience that night was much
the same as those of kroelich and pear-
son i awoke about two oclock in the


jf saw at the end of the avenue  great park with white groups of statues
and fountains  the angle of vision from our position was so narrow that

   we could see very little of it


amazing stories

morning and when i had become fully
conscious i found i had taken some
paper from my desk turned on the light
and was rummaging about for a pencil
when i found it i sat down and began
to write out the fundamental formula
for tuned circuits and the mathematical
expansion of modulated frequencies i
knew them all but it seemed for the
first time that i grasped the real fun-
damental reasons also i did not think
about the fact that i was performing
strangely for that time of the morning
it seemed quite natural

  i became more and more involved in
the series using hyperbolic functions
something i had always dreaded and
feared always hitherto using round-
about methods instead of employing
them i fell to using them without any
consideration of the difficulties of ma-
nipulation after an hour of work i
felt satisfied that i had accomplished
what i had started and went back to bed

in the morning i had not the slight-
est memory of the nights happenings
but i did see several sheets of the most
appalling mathematical intricacies that
anyone ever beheld i had some recol-
lection of having done it all but i could
not make head or tail of it after the
beginning of the series expansion i
slipped the folded sheets into my pocket
and left without thought of breakfast
this was not unusual because i never
arose early enough for it and at that
i usually had to hurry to my eight
oclock classes

  i would not see pearson until eleven
since we were not taking the same elec-
tive courses at eleven we met outside
the door of  and entered kroelichs
classroom when we had reached our
seats kroclich came up to us and with-
out a word put before us half a dozen
sheets of figures immediately i won-
dered if he had had the same experience

as i had the night before at the same
moment pearson and i took similar
sheets from our notebooks

  pearson stared at me and stammered

did you- but i interrupted before

he could speak further

  i did and so did kroelich from the
looks of things

  we missed most of the lecture for
we were examining the three sets of cal-
culations being post graduate students
we were more or less privileged and
kroelich knew that we understood about
all the text book had to offer after his
explanations during our laboratory work
i doubt if he even thought about the
lesson for several times i noticed pauses
in his lecture and each time i perceived
his gaze was in our direction

  none of the calculations were alike
of the three mine were the most logical
from a common-sense standpoint pear-
sons had the appearance of very com-
plicated audio-modulations with opera-
tors which seemed out of place but yet
necessary to the expansions words can-
not describe kroelichs sheets imagine
if you can networks of three dimen-
sional calculations and diagrams of
wildly distorted wave-fronts of the most
bizzare appearance

  what in blazes are these things
said pearson after half an hour i cant
get beyond the first page of any of them
and to think this is in my own writ-
ing he indicated his calculations i
should guarantee it a forgery if i didnt
have a vague memory of having written
the stuff myself early this morning

  the remainder of the lecture made no
more impression on us than the first
half for we were both occupied with
our thoughts trying to remember more
definitely the circumstances of the writ-
ing the night before the class bell
awakened us from our thoughts natur-
ally we proceeded directly to kroelichs
desk
beam transmission



  ill let calloway take my one oclock
class he said you fellows can cut
and well talk this over i confess i
cant make head or tail of it even though
it appears i wrote it let me see your
manuscripts after a short perusal
of each he handed them back to us
some sort of gibberish but there must
be something to it

our afternoons conversation en-
lightened none of us kroelich
suggested that we keep our news to our-
selves lest we be proclaimed a triumvi-
rate of second einsteins personally
i had no desire to show anyone the fig-
ures i had written especially since i
could not explain them and they were
therefore utterly meaningless to me

  then followed three days on the
morning of one of which pearson and
kroelich produced continuations ap-
parently of their previous calculations
and on two of which i had more of
mine to offer strangely enough though
our subjects of calculations differed sim-
ilar operators were appearing in all of
our figures

  if only one of us had these spells
continued kroelich in my room after
we had again looked over the sheets id
suggest a rest cure but with three of us
in the same fix there seems to be no
getting away from the significance of the
thing so far we have not even missed
the sleep weve lost and i know we
dont feel the mental fatigue which only
a fraction of this would cause if it were
just to decipher it the only course
is to let the stuff come and see what it
amounts to since the same operators
are appearing in all of our works per-
haps the end is in sight what well
have remains to be seen though even if
i did believe in it heaven only knows
what we should do with it if the ulti-
mate results look anything like these
pages

  two days later we each had a group
of what appeared to be fundamental
formuke of some nature results of com-
bining all of our previous calculations
kroelich had asked the head of the
mathematics department dean harvey
to view what we had when the latter
arrived in the laboratory we were oper-
ating the bean transmitter just as we
had been doing the day we experienced
the strange numbness

  good afternoon gentlemen the old
man greeted pleasantly we returned
his salutation and were waiting for
kroelich to approach the subject when a
very queer look spread suddenly over
the deans face he steadied himself
as he stepped forward to keep himself
from falling

  im all right boys he said after a
moment i had a feeling of numbness
apparently my years are weighing on me
more than i know

  the three of us glanced momentarily
at each other as the radio instructor
opened the oscillator plate circuit after
a few moments for suitable words to in-
troduce his subject kroelich began the
story of the strange writings which he
assembled from the top of the table
the dean was now one of us and
would undoubtedly experience the same
nightly phenomenon

  harvey pursed his lips as he went
over the sheets strange indeed he
muttered yet logical in every way
there must be a key somewhere the
operators suggest that these final equa-
tions appear ready for solution by mere-
ly substituting values scalars i should
say but without them there is no way
out of the tangle may i take them
along you say that the numbness will
be gone by evening thank you pear-
son pearson had given the professor
his hat as he arose to leave i shall
be back to-morrow afternoon with what
help i may be able to suggest


amazing stories

  after he had left we felt hopeful for
if anyone could help us this man could

  to-morrow said kroelich with a
grin there will be a foursome of
einsteins i

 slept badly that night but i did
not do any more writing the next
morning i found that neither kroelich
nor pearson had either

  i wonder if dean harvey found the
key this from pearson as the two
of us sat at the counter downing a none
too savory lunch funny there is noth-
ing like it in any of the radio publications
kroelich has looked over yet it is all
fundamentally radio frequency work
why does that numbness come to a fel-
low the first time hes around the trans-
mitter when its working and why
should it have anything to do with the
revelations if that is what they are i
hate to just sit around and wait for
things to turn up every day i more
firmly believe that well have something
different if ever we untangle that mess
of formulae well have a thesis topic
anyhow suggested pearson rather ab-
sently those figures would be ac-
ceptable because no one could dispute
their validity

  you always do think of material
gains i said rather disgustedly what
i want to do is to really use the stuff
maybe its a new form of high effi-
ciency power transmission or something
like that

  power transmission mused pear-
son say do you think- he

stopped but his eyes had brightened
another wild dream not such a bad
thought at that and he attempted to
conceal his excitement over his new
idea

  i wondered why the secrecy but said
nothing lets go over to the lab dean
harvey may be early with that we
left

  harvey and kroelich were very excit-
edly talking and figuring when we ar-
rived so absorbed in fact that they
did not notice our appearance but took
us into their conversations the moment
we bent over the desk undoubtedly the
dean had had quite a sleepless night for
he had fourteen sheets in his cramped
figures before him and if ours had been
strange his were doubly so however
it took but a moments notice to see that
he had converted some of his values into
characters familiar to us the italics and
greek letters commonly used for wave-
length velocity and other quantities

  such a thing is unthinkable yet here
it is he was saying in an excited man-
ner his facial expression lifting twenty
years from his rounded shoulders it
means the velocity of light may be mul-
tiplied by any factor in actual prac-
tice and furthermore look at this
it means that objects can be broken
down and transmitted modulating a
specific group of radio frequencies and
set up again in order at some distance
so rapidly that i should think no appear-
ance of melting away would be visible
it would simply mean here and then
there

  undoubtedly the dean had had a reve-
lation which far transcended ours by
comparison kroelich apparently had
followed the train of thought because
he and the professor of mathematics con-
tinued on in words which suddenly took
them above the students plane however
elevated

tite are being rude observed the

  vv dean after half an hour of discus-
sion which was lost on the two of us
he was wiping his high forehead with
his handkerchief

  gentlemen we have in our grasp
that which has never been imagined pos-
sible kroelch will agree that such instru-
ments are feasible even to us 
beam transmission



  eager as a youngster he insisted we
observe the strictest secrecy no need
to tell us that now for we wrere selfish
enough to keep such a discovery to our-
selves

  a thesis subject i suggested sar-
castically to pearson

  to blazes with the thesis he re-
torted were rich no more express
companies a world monopoly for us

  what if it doesnt work after all i
asked because i could not help but
doubt such a fanciful idea becoming
practical

  he had forgotten everything real in
his excitement it will old man it
will

  no use to spoil such dreams until the
test it was such a wild improbability
why should such a power be placed in
the hands of four chosen men with less
merits perhaps than many other people 

  it seemed strange as a dream when i
sat alone in my room looking out over
the familiar street with its rumbling
trucks and rushing automobiles what
if it could be it would require power
of course but friction between mole-
cules might not make necessary more
power than that in the average truck
motor no noise no traffic involved
either with these thoughts i picked up
a text book half believing half unbeliev-
ing lessons suffered because visions
of huge transmitting and receiving
freight and express stations continually
came before me conscentration was
an impossibility

  the experimental glass-working de-
partment of the university was kindly
enough building up the dozen tubes re-
quired for our apparatus were it not
for dean harvey we should have had
no idea of making the thing a practi-
cability in the form of usable instru-
ments once the factors were known
kroelich pearson and t had little diffi-
culty in designing plates and grids for

definite tube constants though they were
a bit alarming in shapes sizes and com-
binations the modulator tubes re-
quired four grids with four cathodes and
one plate indirect heating from a uni-
potential source was a necessity

  otherwise observed kroelich our
transmitted objects might have one hun-
dred and twenty cycle ripples all over
them

  though said in a joking manner it
would no doubt be true dean harvey
had had one more night of writing which
gave him some idea of the order of
things and the methods of procedure
but the three of us had had no more
nightly inspirations

  by the end of two weeks we had the
tubes fortunately enough the required
frequencies were in no instance higher
than eighteen megacycles which appeared
to be the main carrier though it was
doubtful as to what any frequency
would be after the mixtures and addi-
tions which were to take place in the
apparatus

  i only hope it doesnt blow up and
we with it i observed skeptically with
a laugh as we were carefully building
up the inductances of copper tubing one
day excited as usual since we had
begun our actual construction dean
harvey seemed one of us even in age
as he offered help and suggestions every
few moments

  ive been wondering he mentioned
at one time what would happen to liv-
ing things if we tried to transmit them

  none of us said a word not because
we were too busy but because some of
the same thoughts had been in our own
minds from time to time once before
pearson and i had said something about
it rather jokingly such a thing was not
to be dreamed of at the time the cir-
cuits were intricate enough to keep our
minds from wandering to the limits of
such an instrument if it worked at all


amazing stories

the day for our actual tests arrived
i fairly tingled and even felt a
sinking feeling within me as i looked
over the finished transmitter i believe
that my feelings were common to the
two younger men but as for the pro-
fessor i have never seen anyone quite
so eager in all my life our hours to-
gether had been most happy and we
learned to know each other as only
closely associated men can probably
the possibilities of our discovery if it
could be called that and the secrecy in-
volved kept us from talking much to
others about anything lest we drop any
hints i dont believe any of us had
thought of anything else from the time
we began the construction

  what will be first asked pearson

  anything will do said kroelich

  heres my watch said the dean as
he pulled it eagerly from his pocket and
placed it on the pedestal at the focal
point of the carrier wave

  lets try something less valuable
i suggested as i reached for it but the
professor would have none of it i had
a definite feeling that nothing would
happen anyway after the many weeks of
planning and working rather than ex-
cited i felt suddenly quite indifferent
and cold as the everyday things of life
came before my mind yet we feel
contempt for what we know to be facts
life itself even in a single-celled animal
or plant is a thing marvelous beyond
compare man in his glory cannot
create even a single cell and endow it
with that spark called life try as i
would i could not shake off genera-
tions upon generations of belief and in-
stinct it just could not happen we
had been hoaxed

  dean harvey had written up two
sheets of directions for manipulating
the various controls and the sequence of
operating them one by one the switches
were closed we had placed the re-

ceiver simple compared to the trans-
mitter at the other side of the room
the former consisted of a detector or
demodulator and a differentiator not
trusting whatever the resulting actions
of apparatus might be we had placed
the controls at least thirty feet from
the transmitter kroelich was throw-
ing in the switches cautiously watching
anxiously for any untoward happenings
while pearson and i none the less at-
tentive were near him dean harvey
had his nose almost on his watch and
only after repeated entreaties would he
move more than six inches from it

  there was not a sound the only
appearance of life was the dull glow
from the cathodes the more brilliant
filament ends and ionization in two of
the tubes

  soft i observed when the plate
voltages had been applied

  not dangerously so i hope com-
mented kroelich when he had seen
them

  he trembled perceptibly as he touched
the last switch in spite of my indiffer-
ence i felt my knees quaking under
me

  here goes shouted kroelich

  nothing happened we felt the dis-
appointment keenly but i had fully ex-
pected nothing more dean harvey
heaved a sigh that was almost a groan
we all stood around the rather pleasing
array of what was after all junk before
us

  say what is this exclaimed kroe-
lich i forgot to make the tie connec-
tion between these two differentiators

  ill admit the second trial did make
me feel a little differently i began to
wonder if something would happen
again kroelichs hand touched the last
switch it trembled more than it had
before after several moments hesita-
tion he dropped it to his side
beam transmission



qilly i know he said  but i
    cant do itlm

  dean harvey ran to him and slammed
in the switch there was a crack a sud-
den cold breeze a faint glow of ioniza-
tion of the air in the path between the
transmitter and the receiver and the
smell of ozone the watch was gone
we ran to the receiver and saw what
must have formerly been the watch but
it looked more like a metal duplicate of
a fried egg than anything else i could
think of at the time we forgot the sad
plight of the professors watch and
danced about shouting at the tops of
our voices various incoherent words to
the effect that we had been successful

  after the first violent reaction we
were partially dazed i tried my luck
transmitting a half dollar but the result
was again discouraging for the silver
assumed a shape after transmission of
a miniature birds nest we tried a few
more small objects but the results were
always grotesque figures which in no
way resembled the originals on each
was a ripple which kroelich said meant
the need of a filter on our filament sup-
plies in spite of cathode construction

  our trouble however though it
may be serious said the radio instruc-
tor as we sat around his laboratory desk
later does not alter circumstances we
have succeeded in doing something here-
tofore unachieved undreamed of even
if we never succeed in transmitting
things as they are metals and the like
will not suffer by a change in physical
form if the process is not too costly
ores may be transmitted of course we
do not know as yet the range obtainable
or just what would happen if we trans-
mitted an object and the receiver were
out of range where would it go all
of these facts must be discovered

  apparently pearson had not been pay-
ing much attention to the instructors
discourse for he jumped up suddenly

and asked kroelich to put the instru-
ments into operation again he put
what had been the watch on the pedestal
and once more it was transmitted this
time resembling the leaf of a cabbage
nothing daunted he placed this on the
pedestal the third time with the astound-
ing result that the watch appeared at
the receiver as it had been before with
the exception that it was covered with
tiny ripples but it was otherwise identi-
cal with the original timepiece

  i know what is wrong it was-

before pearson could finish alone the
four of us said in the same breath
third harmonic and once more we
jumped about

  i am glad that none saw our wild an-
tics or we should have been taken for
what we were crazy men two days
were necessary before we found the
faulty circuit and introduced the neces-
sary filter to suppress the distorting
harmonic we found the amplitude of
it to be six times that of the funda-
mental the filament-hum filter was
easily added

  after these changes we were as-
sured that there were no limits to the
possibilties all within our grasp we
moved the receiver to my room con-
structed the necessary control panel and
focused the transmitter on it we had
found that opaque materials placed be-
tween the two instruments in no way af-
fected the transmissions the distance
separating the two units was now a lit-
tle more than half a mile but it seemed
as simple as the former twenty feet

  one day shortly after we had suc-
cessfully transmitted from the laboratory
to my room the professor brought a
little white rat with him

nph e sacrifice he announced

  -i- bell go over to your room and
catch this little fellow when he arrives
on his visit


amazing stories

   i thought the dean too over-confident
but after all if it did come through alive
i should not be surprised greatly after
what we had already accomplished i
reached my room and waited a sud-
den snap and there was the rat but it
was dead i called kroelich and told
him the sad story then i once more
proceeded to the laboratory vaguely
wondering why the white rat had been
just as before but without the vital
spark of life when i arrived the dean
was in a deep study evidently he be-
lieved it entirely possible to transmit
the life as well as the body all in one

  kroelich he said at length you
will remember i said the velocity of
light could be multiplied by any factor
in the different stages of the transmitter
we have forgotten all about it i am
afraid step it up about ten times it
is the fourth control on the left bell
you go back to your room ill be back
very shortly with more rodents when
you phone back success well know how
high we must go until then please stay
there well advance by easy stages
until we do succeed as i know we shall

three mice arrived at intervals of
five minutes all dead

  that was five hundred times the
velocity of light commented the dean
after i reported the failure of the third
transmission stay there until we run
out of mice

  then followed three more dead but i
did think i saw a quiver in the last one
just before i touched it the fourth was
a perfectly normal mouse which imme-
diately hopped to my bed and scampered
about in a bewildered way after a few
moments it crouched quietly and re-
mained so i wasted no time in giving
the three men in the laboratory the
report

  stay there stay there shouted
pearson

  after three more mice there was a
pause of half an hour for what pur-
pose i could not imagine but suddenly
i knew why one after another came
a rabbit a guinea pig a kitten another
rabbit all perfectly normal a few sec-
onds after transmission

  quit i told kroelich over the
phone before i have a zoo here yes
they are all apparently all right

  fifteen minutes later the three were
in my room the professor of mathe-
matics grinning like a school boy these
moments of happiness were far from his
ordinary demeanor he had aged in the
few months we had been associated with
him aged years perhaps it was over-
enthusiasm and over-work coupled with
the recent loss of sleep due to our activ-
ities oh perhaps his digestive system
was suffering with age

  well boys said the dean nothing
remains now but to enlarge the ap-
paratus to accommodate larger objects
for instance a man

 he was mad the strain was too
much for him and he was cracking
under it who would voluntarily take
a risk as great as that and to what
end  aeroplane transportation was
rapid enough to prevent any great waste
of time even for the busiest of individ-
uals

  bell the velocity we used when the
mouse arrived alive was better than a
million times the velocity of light more
than xx miles per second
in a molecular state acceleration had no
deleterious effect on organic matter it
means that nervous systems require the
most rapid transfer imaginable if they
are not to have fatal consequences
harvey had changed the subject after
his previous startling remark when he
saw the looks of horror on our faces
the velocity may be increased indefin-
itely with no further effect it may be
necessary for greater distances since it
beam transmission



appears the total lapsed time is what
matters

he enlarged the instruments for
transmitting larger inanimate ob-
jects by paralleling all of the stages and
adding again as many tubes the three
of us had at once put from our minds all
thoughts of transferring human beings
though we said little about it to the
professor

  our revisions were complete the
work had been hurried at the last to
finish late in the evening pearson came
to my room and lighting a cigarette
he stared absently at the desk lamp

  you know bell he began there is
something behind all of this which we
have overlooked i believe such in-
spirations would not occur to four men
night after night without some very
definite reason or cause you and i
are going back to the laboratory to-
night and are going to try something
you know ive had a hunch from the
very beginning of it all but it sounded
too improbable freakish in fact lets
go over now i have the keys

  without much hesitation i followed
him after switching on the lights he
threw the transmitter switches one by
one then he swung the reflector of the
beam slowly over an imaginary pattern
covering carefully the area in the direc-
tion our first beam transmitted had
radiated

  wait was all he would say when
i questioned his actions

  for half an hour this continued
that should get them he finally said
as he again focused the beam on the
receiver the latter had been moved
back to the laboratory for enlargement
with the transmitter

  get whom  i asked in astonish-
ment

  pearson said nothing but leaving the
instruments operating drew up a chair

and lighting a cigarette crossed his
legs as if to wait for something which
he was sure would happen i did about
the same wondering just what he hoped
would happen i became restless after
fifteen minutes or so and began pacing
back and forth trying to get a word
from pearson

there was a sudden crack a blue
corona and a tingling sensation
both of us sprang to the receiver and
beheld a small red object apparently
made of some metal

  can we touch it i queried

  if it isnt hot or something why
not said my companion as he picked
it up carefully

  what is it and where did it come
from i asked as i examined the lit-
tle figure

  it looked like a misshapen chunk of
metal but it had evidently been carved
or molded into a definite shape the
central portion looked circular in shape
and had many tiny appendages around
the periphery on one flat side was a
lump resembling a head with two eyes
apparently widely separated one small
hole was set between them slightly
lower with a wide mouth below it out-
side of these and two circular portions
at the side of this malformed head there
was nothing human or even animal
about it on the other flat side were
two tentacles which were in length
about three times the diameter of the
disc body each tentacle terminated in
seven digits like fingers but without
nails

  looks like an example of cubist
statuary i suggested laughing

  it is a statue said pearson in all
seriousness and it came from outside
space somewhere

  what i exclaimed do you mean
to tell me that-

  all the facts point to it our trans-


amazing stories

mitter beam must have been intercepted
by some other beam in space we were
naturally in the path and it split up
after numbing us never leaving us after
that first day dean harvey came under
the influence himself and through these
we were directed to write out the formu-
la in our own language and directed to
build the apparatus it was therefore
not meant to be a commercial gift to us
but a means of communication with god
knows what we have established a
link which will enable us eventually to
discover the source of our amazing
information ill get kroelich and
harvey and you just watch their eyes
pop out when they see the present we
were sent via the receiver what it is
is hard to guess

  pearson had just left the laboratory
when there was another snap and pung-
ent odor of ozone another statue had
appeared this one a naked man this
was indeed astounding the figure
showed intelligent clean-cut features
this time and it was made of a silver-
like metal resembling pewter the pro-
portions were identical with those of a
human being of the earth

  i had just completed a close scrutiny
of it when there was another snap this
time it was a statue of a three-legged
animal with a neck like a giraffe just
then dean harvey kroelich and pearson
came in i showed them the collection
to their amazement

during the next hour we received
six more statues of animals fol-
lowed by three of trees or objects sim-
ilar to the earthly counterparts

  i dont doubt that you are correct
in your surmises pearson commented
the professor these can be only min-
iatures of the fauna and flora of anoth-
er world it is utterly impossible that
anyone else on this earth has such a
transmitter and is hoaxing us we shall

send them samples of this world in the
morning i cannot understand how-
ever why the figure of the man was
sent after that first odd object could it

be- hm and dean harvey

changed the subject no telling what
tremendous distances have been covered
when we consider that the factor of
multiplication may even have exceeded
by far the velocity of light itself the
velocity of light squared would be a
velocity inconceivable to the average
mind yet apparently this is only a rel-
atively low figure considering our own
experiments

  nice little collection we have but
people hidebound would only laugh if
we told them what we thought them to
be not a word about it as yet fel-
lows 

  next morning pearson and i went
shopping for the common china and metal
figures of men and women dogs cattle
and the like and brought them to the
laboratory

  before we send them we must steril-
ize them thoroughly warned the pro-
fessor

  those words we learned later were
the link to the basis of the entire pro-
ject one so bizarre that it would stag-
ger the mind which first realized the
truth that we were dealing with a
superior intelligence remote in space
could not be doubted

  no doubt they have taken the same
precautions or we should not be alive
now after handling these objects they
must have carried millions of bacteria
which are now dead or unsuspecting
you two fellows might have brought
death to the population of the entire
world such a thing is within the
range of possibility through genera-
tions upon generations we have acquired
a partial immunity to bacteria in not
too large numbers in each of our
bodies there are probably specimens of
beam transmission



almost all disease bacteria but they
are kept from multiplying and causing
symptoms of these diseases because we
are more or less immune to them when
our bodies are physically depleted some
of them may take a foothold we have
developed toxins antitoxins toxin-anti-
toxins bacteriophage and the like to
fight them when they become virulent
a white man in the tropics becomes an
easy prey to fever while the natives
are immune north american indians
had no immunity to white mens dis-
eases for they had never contracted
them before hence they died from
smallpox and measles allergies are
somewhat similiar contact with for-
eign proteins causes what we know as
hay fever many of us are immune
from age-old contact with these pro-
teins which do not irritate our mem-
branes

hat could we do if suddenly
new forms of bacteria or pro-
tozoa suddenly appeared on the earth
before any means of combatting them
could be prepared the population of
the world would probably have disap-
peared undoubtedly our objects will
be received in an hermetically sealed
room and disinfected before the other
intelligent beings examine them be-
cause they figured we should overlook
such a fact they took care of the dis-
infecting before they transmitted these
statuettes that indicates they are not
avaricious for they could have annihil-
ated us easily

  kroelich produced some antiseptic
from the first aid cabinet and we thor-
oughly sprayed our china and metal
images then kroelich put the tran-
smitter into operation

  what velocity professor harvey
he asked when he came to the velocity
multiplier control

  try a billion times was the an-

swer we cannot tell how far away
they are and the added speed cannot do
any damage we should waste as little
time as possible

  every fifteen minutes we sent out into
space an image until our supply was ex-
hausted

  that should be enough for to-night
how long did you have to wait until
you had your first statue after you had
started the transmitter asked the dean
as he turned to pearson

  roughly half an hour was the re-
ply but how do we know what velocity
they employ

  we dont of course but i should
judge half an hour will be sufficient
time

  so for a half hour we talked over the
possibilities of carrying on intelligent
communications with out distant neigh-
bors of transporting materials from one
world to another of the possibility that
platinum and gold were abundant there
and that in return we might be able to
send them what were common materials
to us though rare on their planet in ex-
change i must confess that our
dreams became quite wild by the time
kroelich rose to shut down the trans-
mitter and usually so practical-minded
the dean had kept pace with us all
along

the next morning found us eagerly
awaiting more transmissions from
the far-away world

  they will be of an intelligent nature
no doubt commented dean harvey 
should say writings and the like

  after twenty minutes of operation
there was the usual instantaneous co-
rona and loud snap before us on the
receiver was a thin sheet of parch-
ment and on it a triangle circle and
square drawn with black crayon the
professor whose joy could only be im-
agined hastily drew the same figures on


amazing

stories

a piece of paper and added three dimen-
sional figures as well a cube cylinder
and pyramid this was transmitted im-
mediately back came a single figure a
right triangle with squares drawn each
having as an edge one side of the tri-
angle and each divided into smaller unit
squares

  to indicate the sum of the squares
of the two sides equals the square of the
hypothenuse exclaimed the dean eager-
ly theyve had a pythagoras too

  for the next hour we exchanged
familiar geometric and theorems which
could be illustrated by figures i sug-
gested a language lesson but kroelich
indicated the difficulty showing me that
we had no things in common for a basis

  imagine if you can he said ex-
plaining such a thing as color to a per-
son who was born blind here of course
we can transmit a paper with colors on
it but it will serve as an example how
would you explain red for instance
you would name red objccts ten to one
and yet how could a blind person vis-
ualize the color you could say that
it was the lowest frequency of the vis-
ible spectrum just above the infra-red
or heat waves but that does not describe
the effect on the retina of the eye and the
sense of color received by the brain
cells

  however the dean acted on my sug-
gestion in-so-far as to write the numbers
to ten drawing first the number of
squares and then placing the numbers
beside them we received the same in
turn but the characters were quite
strange to us as would be expected

finally dean harvey exclaimed
im going myself then well have
a medium of exchange

  we stood aghast no we said
almost simultaneously how did he
know what the temperature would be if
the temperature were fit for human

lungs he retaliated that the human
figure we had received was identical with
our own species we argued that was
not sufficient proof on the other
worlds adaptations would not preclude
the possible existence of substances pois-
onous to beings of our world but in
the end we lost as we knew we should
ever since he had first suggested the
transmission of animate objects we had
feared the outcome

  the transmitter was turned off and
the dean took a blank notebook with
him as he sat on the now enlarged ped-
estal

  i know ill be all right but in case
something should happen my affairs are
all arranged i am an old man all
alone with little for which to live and
this is my greatest desire please be
good fellows keep both instruments
operating and you will get messages in
good old english and ill guarantee
the strangest mortal eyes ever beheld

  pearson finally said he would do it
and one by one the switches were
thrown in the velocity control was at
a factor of a billion times now all of
the switches were in but the last

  i dont feel a thing said the pro-
fessor go right ahead

  pearson closed his eyes and in vis-
ible agony threw the last switch the
dean was gone i felt mighty unsteady
and dizzy from the nervous shock but
the three of us did the best we could
under the circumstances by grouping
ourselves about the receiver we waited
for ages

  perhaps it was only a few minutes un-
til there was a snap and a page of the
professors notebook appeared before
us on it was his cramped writing
all right fellows i am in a glass
room to prevent i believe my bacteria
from getting out before me are the
strangest things ive ever seen there
are none of the men here only the mon-
eam transmission



sters similar to the first statue we re-
ceived they are the intelligent crea-
tures of this world beyond a doubt
though every bit as ugly as our model
of them they are not an evil appearing
lot it seems they anticipated the fact
that i might want to transmit mes-
sages back to you and took the paper
after indicating that i was to spray it
with a little atomizer in this cell the
transmitter is queer looking but after
all it resembles ours to some degree i
have also examined the receiver in the
compartment with me and find it not un-
like our own at least the conductors
are copper and the walls of the tubes
glass i created quite a surprise on my
arrival to judge from their apparently
animated conversations but they seem
to be grateful that i risked the trip to
visit them

that was all where was he the
direction of the transmitter did not
fall near any of the planets of our sys-
tem perhaps he was on a system re-
mote in our galaxy or perhaps even out
of that iiow long had it taken him to
make the journey at one billion the vel-
ocity of light i hastily wrote a note
asking the professor to time the arrival
he had always prided himself on the
accuracy of his new watch we had not
been able to iron out the one hundred
twenty cycle ripple on his old one and
in the laboratory was an electric clock
certainly the distance was great enough
to get some idea of its magnitude i
gave the time of transmission and sent
it to the second

  back came the message no mea-
surable lapsed time

  kroelich cut down to a factor of one
thousand times the velocity of light and
we tried again the same answer came
back next we tried the velocity of
light itself but still the professor could
not measure the interval we began to

look at each other in surprise three or
four seconds should be noticeable that
would make the distance roughly half a
million miles and what body was that
close to the earth yet the indications
were that it was even closer i began
to think that something was quite wrong

  here goes the reversing switch said
pearson as he changed the multiplier to
a divisor half the velocity of light
this time the dean showed surprise
and inquired if everything were in work-
ing order	r

  one hundredth or only  miles
per second said kroclich

  still too small to measure was the re-
port one thousandth and no better

  lets make the change a big one
and check the apparatus something is
very surely wrong and kroelich
switched to a millionth the velocity of
light

  noticed a fraction that time was
the professors report back to us

  one billionth something was out of
adjustment

  that is only about a foot a second
i said after a rough mental calculation

  nevertheless here goes answered
kroelich we must find the trouble
forty seconds reported the pro-
fessor what factor

  we told him and he agreed with us
that it was an impossibility

  switch to one billion times i am
coming back

  in a moment the professor appeared
none the worse for his long journey ap-
parently

  forty seconds for forty feet im-
possible he said shaking his head de-
cisively that would put it over in
that brick wall which would never
never do my watch checks the clock
to a second too we shall have to find
the mistake he went into details
describing the creatures he had seen
i dont know why they didnt fumigate


amazing stories

me and let me out he continued in a
disappointed manner perhaps they
were afraid of what i might do to them
a violent character from an unknown
partly civilized world or something of
that sort

that night after finally falling
asleep after the days unbelievable
happenings i awoke with a start with
the four words forty feet forty sec-
onds running through my mind sud-
denly i sat up in bed if distances in
our own solar system were relatively the
same as those of the supposed atom why
could not life be possible on an elec-
tron such as we thought the latter to
be why could not all of the stars we
could see in the sky be protons with
their planets the electrons of some ma-
crocosmic system was there a limit in
either direction were the relative dis-
tances and structures merely accidentally
the same

  such nonsense i told myself but i
could not sleep i realized suddenly that
i was trying to prove to myself that the
dean had been only forty feet from us
all of the time tremendously reduced in
size of course but what could cause
such a reduction  wrhat would make
his molecules shrink accordingly if
they had not he would have been all
protons and electrons with no space
the energy needed to force all of the
electrons from their orbits would have
been more than a human mind could
conceive there would have been no
professor as we had known him if that
process had taken place he could not
have been in the wall in a microcosmic
planetary system that was all there was
to it the minutes he had been away
from us would have been thousands of
centuries on an electron yet scientists
were agreeing there was no such thing
as time we merely measured intervals
by means of seconds minutes hours

etc yet would not full lives seemingly
be lived to men assuming the possibility
of life on an electron in a bare fraction
of a second ticked off by an earthly
clock perhaps after all there was
nothing definite about time

  after a few more attempts at an ex-
planation i fell back to sleep the next
morning i was in as much of a muddle
as before why did my idea persist
when i knew it could not be i would
say nothing about it to my friends be-
cause it seemed so absurd

  and yet during the next two days
all of the checks we made proved that
the indicator was correct and the idea i
had had was more firmly fixed in my
mind its unreasonableness kept me
from mentioning it though i wondered
if pearson had similar thoughts to
mine

tt seems we must accept things as
as they are until we can get an
astronomical chart from the strange
world or give them one of ours hoping
that they with it and their advanced
science can point out their location in
our galaxy if they are that near us
said the professor after we had given
up trying to solve the riddle there
is no link to show the reason for this
tremendous discrepancy why not all
of us take the trip  my words can
never give the impression you will get
when you have seen what i saw

  never i said to myself but the
next afternoon after the dean kroelich
and pearson had taken the voyage and
sent reassuring messages i found my-
self on the pedestal as if in a dream it
could not be real and i believe i actually
laughed out loud rather hollowly no
doubt

  calloway kroelichs junior assistant
had been taken into our confidence and
was at the controls of the transmitter
i was cold through and through as
beam transmission



one by one the switches were closed as
calloway touched the last switch handle
i had a mad desire to jump but fear
had paralyzed me and suddenly i was
whisked from the light through the
briefest interval of darkness and into
light again

  about me were my three friends
j smiling each with reassuring words
on his lips

  not bad was it inquired pearson
with his hand on my shoulder and
look r

  i did and stared in wonder at the
sight before my eyes yes they were
alive but what a nightmare four mon-
sters living discs fully as great in di-
ameter as an average mans height with
tentacles eight feet long and what
faces still there was no ferocious ex-
pression only what i should interpret as
eagerness they were a deep red color
and had large piercing black eyes all
were reclining on an edge of the disc
which seemed to be the body proper
resting it to keep it from falling flat by
means of the smooth snake-like ten-
tacles all about the periphery of the
disc were two rows one on each edge
of little cup-like appendages there
was no sign of hair or clothes with the
exception that small discs of metal on
cords were about their stubby necks
the ears were membranes about the
size of a silver dollar on the sides of the
head on the surface the hole between
and below the eyes was undoubtedly the
breathing tube the lips were not
heavy but the mouth was very wide
lending rather an unpleasant expression
to the face the teeth were quite like
human teeth in shape quite uniform and
black as ebony

  the dean an old friend by virtue of
his previous visit was naturally our
spokesman at the time he resorted to
gesticulations and sign language first

of all he tried to show the creatures that
we wanted to leave our prison of glass
in response one of the beings pressed a
button on the wall and shortly after a
man entered not a bit different from us
except in his manner of dress he wore
a tunic which fell to his knees and on his
feet were sandals his features were
classic while his hair was kept from fall-
ing over his eyes by a red band about his
head crossing his forehead

his attitude was not that of a servant
for there was no suggestion of ser-
vility in his manner after a short con-
versation while he was kept from us by
the intervening sheets of glass the man
left the room nothing transpired for
some time so i took in our compart-
ment it was entirely made of clear glass
there was the antiseptic atomizer the
dean had mentioned in his first message
with the exception of insulating ma-
terials which seemed to be of a sulphur
basis the receiver was not unlike our
own the transmitter in the room out-
side was a bit larger than ours but it
was recognizable as the counterpart the
room was lighted indirectly by means of
several hanging translucent bowls the
walls were smooth and white the ma-
terial was similar to gypsum plaster

   the creatures were standing if it could
be called that about a table near the
transmitter on the wall behind the lat-
ter was a control board and to one side
a series of buttons one of which had
summoned the man to the room

  i cannot guess how much time elapsed
until the man had returned with three
companions because the strange sur-
roundings were of such interest each
had what turned out to be thin light
hermetically sealed suits with removable
transparent helmets on the front of
each was a disinfector like a gas mask
allowing free intake of air for breathing
but sterilizing it and the exhaled breath


amazing stories

as the latter passed out to the outside
air apparently there was little differ-
ence in the composition of their atmos-
phere from ours i learned later that the
oxygen content was a little lower the
difference being made up by nitrogen
also little difference existed in the force
of gravity of that world from our own

  the suits were placed in a small glass
chamber adjoining ours the door was
closed and the first man we had seen
indicated we were to open the door lead-
ing from the small chamber to ours and
don the suits they had been sprayed
after having been placed in the small com-
partment to safeguard us without much
hesitation and little discussion we did so

  we shall spray each other to eradicate
the effects of touching the suits said
the professor before we connected the
helmets which were secured by a quarter
turn

  after that we used sign language be-
tween ourselves since our voices were
inaudible through the helmets as we
sprayed each other the creatures and the
four men showed pleasure that we
grasped the meaning of the whole proce-
dure the creatures mouths curled into
what must have been smiles or grins
while the expressions on the mens faces
were those of happiness of normal peo-
ple as we know them

after we had finished our disinfec-
tion we passed through the two
glass doors and stood before the group
only friendliness was apparent though
we could hardly judge the superior be-
ings by their expressions we were
happy when the man we had first seen
after a few words with one of the crea-
tures led us from the room to a corri-
dor into which opened many doors at
regular intervals we entered an auto-
matic elevator not much different from
those on earth and at a rapid rate de-
scended after perhaps twenty seconds

the elevator came to a stop and we
stepped out into a corridor similar to the
one many stories above our guide opened
the first door and motioned for us to
enter what were apparently our living
quarters a suite of five rooms with com-
fortable lounges and pillows the gen-
eral impression was that of earthly orien-
tal luxury

  after ten minutes of gesticulation the
guide succeeded in explaining to dean
harvey that we could remove our suits
in our quarters but we must wear them
when we intended leaving it using a dis-
infectant as before then he nodded and
closed the door we immediately took
off our suits with various comments of
wonderment over what we had seen
pearson was the first one out of his suit
and reached a window before the rest
of us below many stories was a wide
avenue while all about were glistening
white towers and massive structures
graceful in spite of their immensity we
saw at the end of the avenue a great
park with white groups of statues and
fountains but the angle of vision from
our position was so narrow that we could
see very little of it the other end of the
avenue continued as far as the eye could
reach with tall buildings hemming it in
on both sides a number of cross-streets
were also visible at regular intervals

  a sun was shining in the heavens
somewhere but the most startling thing
was that the sky above was a bright car-
mine in color fleecy white clouds drift-
ed across this to us amazing back-
ground blown by a breeze we could not
feel in our closed apartment dean har-
vey forbade us to attempt opening a win-
dow

  apparently i was correct in my ideas
of contamination he said without any
pride a man of his learning makes
statements of facts without even expect-
ing to be refuted and finds no satisfac-
tion in their ultimate proof for he knows
beam transmission



the truth when he states the facts hcncc
to him no denial is even imagined

  that sky is startling he continued
at length but we are forever judging
by earthly standards when all of the
facts are considered it is really a won-
der that men exist at all on this world
much less so near in scale to the domi-
nant beings why should evolution
choose our type to be supreme or even
intelligent on every inhabited planet as
probably all of them are inhabited why
should life be impossible in atmospheres
composed almost entirely of hydrogen or
in temperatures too low for us why
should muscular energy require identical
metabolisms and anabolisms as ours
why should oxygen be a requirement
when energy may be released in other
combinations such as aluminum and many
other elements with chlorine or why a
liquid circulatory system such as ours
we are hidebound and narrow without
any vision i am surprised that this
world is as similar to ours as it is espe-
cially with regard to atmosphere but this
fact is very important to us naturally
probably existing in very few of the my-
riads of solar systems we are the first
extra-terrestrials to visit this world we
may of course be rightfully proud and
feel highly honored but it has been du-
plicated countless millions of times in
other systems the universe is without
end infinite in the fullest meaning of the
word what wonders must exist in the
glory of the starry firmament we see
about the earth

iire are most assuredly in a very

  vv remote system unless the fine dust
particles which give color to any sky are
much different in this world the sun
seems t give what we would call white
light our own sun is really red in com-
parison with some of the stars anyone
may see every star undoubtedly has its
planetary system like our own each sys-

  tem similar to the structure of an atom
with the sun as the nucleus of protons

  an atom i had forgotten my previ-
ous thoughts but the professors refer-
ence to it gave me a sudden start

  i hope we are conducted on a tour
of this city said kroelich at length

  after watching the amazing sky for
some time occasionally seeing torpedo-
like aircraft sailing far above us too far
distant for us to make out any details
we watched the street below with its
crowds moving in both directions but
again the height was too great for us to
discern any objects distinctly

  we must be at least a thousand feet
up i remarked

  quite an apartment we have re-
marked pearson as we turned our at-
tentions to our new home and good
old water too this from the bathroom
it is pretty flat though probably because
we are accustomed to the chlorinated
variety

  nevertheless it was good water and
we partook of it not so much because
of thirst as from curiosity

  there was a knock at the door and a
note was dropped through the slot

  from calloway said kroelich as he
scanned it he wants to know how
things are progressing well send him
an answer so he wont have cause for
alarm or worry i hope his vigil does not
become too monotonous

  a message of reassurance was written
disinfected and returned via the slot to
the waiting messenger outside the door

  we were all smoking speaking of what
might be in store for us during our visit
when there was a knock and another
message or rather what turned out to be
a sketch of a man in a suit similar to
ours

  i guess one or all of us are wanted
said pearson as he began pulling on his
suit ill find out spray me bell

i did and he left the room returning


amazing stories

immediately with a large tray of food
under a tight fitting cover

  i like our visit more and more right
along he said removing his helmet
they have human requirements after
all or otherwise recognize the fact that
we have

the meal was much the same as one
on earth meat vegetables and the
milk of some mammal of course the
tastes were different but not at all un-
pleasant the milk was quite aromatic

  probably due to some common plant
with an aromatic flavor which is eaten by
the cattle here answered the professor

  a short while after we had satisfied
our appetites there was another knock
on our door and a sheet of parchment
with four figures in suits dropped to the
floor

  we all go this time i said

  the strangeness of this unknown
world made us eager for every new ven-
ture we left the apartment after spray-
ing each others suits and followed the
guide to the elevator in which we liad
descended from the transmitter room
this time we rose some twenty stories
and stepped out into the corridor since
all of them which we had seen were al-
most identical we could not tell one from
another or whether or not it was the
first we had been in we passed several
doors before the man opened one and
pointed for us to enter

  this room looked much like an operat-
ing room and laboratory for surgical and
medical research i was surprised that
even glassware test tubes beakers and
the rest was much like what i had seen
obviously there was little difference in
the final mechanical and physical forms
which evolved through various stages for
definite purposes mechanical forms
such as the lever and the wheel would
appear with the dawn of any civiliza-
tion

  half a dozen men and four women the
latter the first we had seen were await-
ing us in the centcr of the room was
a glass compartment with two openings
in one wall i was the first one directed
to enter as soon as the second compart-
ment door closed one of the women mo-
tioned for me to remove my suit and
then pointed at the inside of her left
arm at the joint curious i sat on the
stool provided and rolled my shirt sleeve
above my elbow the girl then put on
arm-length flexible gloves of a material
similar to rubber and taking a large
empty hypodermic syringe in her right
hand inserted both hands through the
holes in the wall i saw then that they
too were rubber covered each having
an opening which would close when the
arms were withdrawn preventing an
opening to the air of the room

  i shrank back when i saw the syringe

i	was not going to be a martyr to their
experiments or a sacrifice to furnish ma-
terial for a few notebook pages on ad-
vanced surgical experiments the pro-
fessor was nodding to me telling me not
to be frightened it was all very well
for him to maintain his composure but
he was not at that moment in my shoes
the girl pleasant looking smiled reas-
suringly so finally i sat down once more
to find out what dire purpose she had in
mind it did not take her long to show
me she merely wanted a blood specimen
after that i co-operated to the best of
my ability grasping my left arm tightly
above the elbow with my right hand at
the same time flexing the fingers of my
left hand

in a moment like an expert which she
undoubtedly was she had applied a
swab and made the introduction into the
vein the withdrawal was perhaps three
ounces a second swab followed the ex-
traction of the needle after which i put
on my suit none the worse for my exper-
beam transmission



ience sprayed my suit carefully and left
the chamber

  in turn the professor kroelich and
pearson gave up a like amount of their
blood we were allowed to watch the
laboratory work for some time before
being escorted back to our apartment
four of the creatures had entered and
worked with the attendants we were of
course interested in the purpose of the
collection of the blood specimens per-
sonally i thought the beings of this world
were curious and wished to examine the
blood for the purpose of determining the
similarity in corpuscles with those of
their own blood i fully expected that
x-ray examinations of our skeletons and
internal organs would be made next i
was partly wrong in that surmise

  small specimens of our blood were
taken by four of the male attendants
and put on slides presumably for micro-
scopic examinations in part this was
true but the microscopes through great
magnification and very brilliant illumina-
tion projected the images on screens
mounted horizontally behind the instru-
ments

  the leucocytes and red corpuscles were
apparent as well as various other cell
forms bactcria no doubt but i was hard-
ly familiar with this study and could not
identify them movements were per-
ceptible in some but the heat from the
brilliant source of lighting was causing
rapid death

  each operator was sketching all differ-
ent cell forms before him and writing
comments after each the work required
very few minutes in the hands of these
experts a comparison was made by all
four men evidently one of them had
found evidence of something different
or unusual immediately i wondered if
i were sick with something but the at-
tendant who had made the discovery mo-
tioned to dean harvey to follow him
our guide then touched our shoulders

and beckoned the three of us to follow
him we were reluctant to leave the pro-
fessor behind but we could conceive of
no harm coming to him after our experi-
ence with the doctors of this strange
world

  when we had removed our suits in
our rooms pearson and i voiced our cur-
iosity kroelich was silent for a moment
and then spoke words which sickened us
at heart

  i guess you boys did not know that
dean harvey is dying of internal cancer
that is one of the reasons he was not
afraid to make the first trip he has not
many weeks to live but he certainly is
putting up a mighty brave fight dont
say anything about it to him i believe
that these men have discovered his serious
state through some evidence in his blood
specimen they would naturally show
interest in something different from
forms in our blood specimens

d rofessor harvey returned
during our further discussion of his
plight whereupon we forced smiles and
all helped him remove his suit in spite
of his apparent cheerfulness we could
see a hidden hint of terror in his eyes

  well i feel far more honored than
you fellows were his first words they
chose me as the first earth man to be
examined with fluoroseope and x-ray

  he averted his eyes for a moment or
two and then with his usual composure
changed the subject never a word from
those lips complaining of the mental and
physical torture he had endured for
months without the slightest ray of hope
discovery had been too late for surgical
removal every day brought the inevit-
able end much nearer

  it was some time before we were able
to think of other things about us every
day and sometimes twice a day we ex-
changed messages with calloway prob-
ably i shall not mention this fact again


amazing stories

for it became one of our regular routines

  that evening upon our response to a
knock four figures in suits entered they
had books and writing materials under
their arms at first glance their helmets
seemed different from those we wore
closer scrutiny revealed they were equip-
ped with transmitters and receivers for
communication with us and that the wear-
ers were femiffine we were to have
our first lessons

  seems they hope our visit will be a
lengthy one pearson observed but i
see no need to hurry our departure since
we can go at any time and this is some
experience ill bet we will be shown
everything

  there is no need to go into much de-
tail concerning the instructions as we
had expected the language was simple
after centuries of change and perfecting
also it was common to the men and the
superior beings after only a week we
had practically mastered the spoken as
well as the written tongue the voices
of the girls were little different from
those we had heard on earth the langu-
age itself was hardly beautiful in sound
but it was practical i wondered if the
hardness was typical of the race if art
was unknown and if everything was sacri-
ficed for practical things

  our instructors were both patient and
pleasant they had duties to perform
and were performing them probably feel-
ing some pride in being the first to make
really intelligent contact with the visitors
from another planet

  as soon as we had the barest working
knowledge of the new tongue we poured
continual streams of questions into our
teachers ears there were no secrets
and all of the answers were simple and
direct either everyone knew all there
was to know or these four were particul-
arly cognizant of their world and its hap-
penings judging from what standards
we could supply their globe was only

slightly smaller in diameter than ours
but its surface was nine-tenths water with
only two continents sar upon which we
were and poru a nearby island of very
nearly the same size there were smaller
islands belonging to each continent of
relatively little importance

the days were approximately twen-
ty-two hours of our time in length
and the temperature ranges were very
similar to those on the earth even at the
poles which were solid ice-caps the
fyns or creatures we had first seen were
truly a puzzle to us they bothered lit-
tle about the humans being more tolerant
than loving they acted as protectors
but did not demand tribute or even labor
they supplied much of the machine de-
sign for they were very skilled mentally
the brain was not any larger than that
of a man but the fyns concentrated only
in a few fields surgery and medicine
were far advanced as were mechanical
devices atomic power had been released
but was not yet extensively used except
in aircraft and vehicles there was little
heavy work to be done outside of mining
and building and the older atomic hydro-
gen engines were relatively efficient even
electrical energy was still used as a source
of much power the change to atomic
power was being made gradually

  men were taught by the fyns and given
everything in the way of knowledge no
civil wars had ever been recorded it
was understood that men were expected
to aid in a national emergency so al-
though they mixed little socially and lived
apart life in general ran very smoothly
it seemed the fyns even looked with
pride upon their kind and unselfish treat-
ment of the other race though they were
never arrogant there was perhaps a
feeling of superiority-rightfully for
they knew that man depended on them
for better methods and other vital mat-
ters men were their children

  on the island of poru lived the green
beings like the fyns except in color
called rus and with them in the same
manner as on sar men similar to those
of sar the same relations existed also
but the population had become far too
great for convenience sar hundreds of
years before had been visited by a plague
traced to bacteria from the nearest planet
in their solar system which had wiped
out three-quarters of the population in
four days before it had been checked
with serums  poru had lost only rela-
tively few for their physicians had found
an antitoxin luckily enough at the end
of the very first day

because the rus had been too busy
saving their own nation they had
not given much thought to their neigh-
bors on sar a feeling of bitterness de-
veloped quite naturally the rus claim-
ing medical superiority while the fyns
hated all the peoples of poru becausc they
had not aided them though the cen-
turies had passed it was not difficult for
the two nations to find little hates to add
to the original store for one does not
need to go far to find trouble a state
of armed truoe had existed for fifty
years neither side cared to strike the
offensive blow since both had the same
engines of destruction and protective de-
vices against them new inventions and
ideas did spring up but both nations had
such clever spy systems that nothing im-
portant ever happened on either island
which remained a secret longer than a
day or two

  it was obvious that such a truce could
not last forever and sooner or later the
break would occur probably instigated
by the people of poru who must find
space for their extra millions by very
special precautions the fyns had kept
secret the method of our coming but our
presence was at once known and also
that we were visitors from another solar

system the rus demanded they be al-
lowed to extend the visitors a welcome
in poru which was only fitting and prop-
er they said but prompt refusal was
the answer of the sarians immediately
diplomatic relations were strained to the
snapping point the four of us had been
summoned to aid in the destruction of
poru was the gist of a message

  our quarters were immediately changed
to the lower floors of the building some
four hundred feet under the surface and
thousands of armed men stationed 
every floor above us to prevent our kid-
naping but after a few days the matter
blew over as such matters do another
cancer was added on both sides

  in spite of the depth we detected no
difference in the comfort of our new
suite even dampness being lacking of
course all of our illumination was now
artificial what wre had taken for incan-
descent bulbs were really radiators of
light flux fed by quartz rod transmission
lines from central light-stations we
were to see all of these things in a few
days we were told by our instructors
who still spent hours with us for the
most part devoted to answering our ques-
tions the dean had been repeatedly
called away to the surgical room

  for some tests he explained

  after a week he had lost the haunted
look in his eyes and he seemed less like
the dying man that we thought he must
be

  these fellows certainly are medical
geniuses he said ill have something
marvelous to tell you boys before long if
the tests are successful

  his smile was more in evidence day
after day a few days later the four of
us were taken to the medical laboratory
and all but the dean were given a tiny
injection and told to lie upon the floor
immediately the dean told us that he
had had his the day before suddenly we
felt a terrific nausea followed by pains


amazing stories

which caused a sudden lapse of conscious-
ness perhaps only for several seconds
still feeling weak we were motioned to
arise and remove our suits

  the whole nation of sarians had been
inoculated for all of the diseases we had
carried and we had been likewise inocu-
lated for theirs which were very few the
injections we had just had were also for
something the dean had carried in his
bloodstream not found in the three of us

  but it is not contagious said the
professor to the attendant and it is not
a germ disease

  you will agree that you are recov-
ered will you not asked the doctor

  yes but your injections have been
direct and merely destroyed what you
term the irritant which causes abnormal
cell growth such as cancer

  true enough returned the sarian
but if this irritant were duplicated in
the laboratory and strengthened a thou-
sand fold it would promote cancerous
growth on contact and at a prodigious
rate see

we were led to another room where
large glass jars stood in long rows
on tables

  in cultures all of your bacteria were
bred separately and serums made for
their destruction here we have cancer-
ous growth which we also developed by
adding flesh and our irritant which acts
like a catalyst

  he opened the jar which had an ugly
green and red blotched malignant growth
in it and an overpowering odor of putre-
faction

  had you not been inoculated a short
while ago you would now be dead men
commented the doctor

  he went to another jar procured a
piece of meat weighing probably five
pounds and dropped it into the cancer
culture jar before the meat reached the
bottom of the jar it underwent a change

in form festering out into horrible sores
and welts in thirty seconds it was a
rotting mass

  is that sufficient proof gentleman
it is we agreed after the vivid
demonstration

  referring to the ordinary cancer
said kroelich have you a definite cure
the professor is now in perfect health
he is years ago we had much the
same abnormal cell growth which became
the greatest cause of death it was not
an animal or plant organism we finally
isolated the irritant and it did not take
long to find a combatant you under-
stand of course a vast difference exists
between his cancer and what you have
just witnessed

  next day i asked my instructor the
purpose of the awful thing we had seen

  it is a secret even from us she whis-
pered but my brother is one of the
doctors you saw and he told me you
must swear to tell no one that new
form of cancer will be used with the
other bacteria you carried as a terrible
weapon against the hated island of poru
we have all been inoculated against them
here disease is quite rare because of the
high development of antitoxins and
serums but your forms being new here
have never been anticipated before the
poruvians can manufacture defensive an-
titoxins for the thirty diseases we have
grown in cultures they will be extinct it
is sickening and revolting to me even
though i am a sarian and know the
poruvians would do as much to us did
they hold such a weapon i hate it all
but we realize that a blow must be struck
before we are taken by surprise by some
destructive offensive from poru rumor
has it that there is such a weapon but
even the spies cannot ferret out details
so the women of this world did have
the finer qualities possessed by their sis-
ters on the earth

  were the others to know of my sen-
beam transmission



timentalities i should be an outcast she
said so you wont tell them 

  she had put her hand over one of mine
and squeezed it gently in her appeal

  never i said

  for a moment she looked at me with
kind eyes and then we are to show you
the city today

  at last our chance had come to view
the mighty things the fyns had reared
through the centuries

tirst you are to appear before a
council of fyns who wish to learn
some first-hand information about your
world

  wre followed my instructor to another
elevator and ascended many floors when
we stepped into the corridor we found it
wider than those we had seen with rela-
tively few doors leading from it our
guide rapped on one and when it opened
we found ourselves at the end of a large
hall at the opposite side was a group
of fyns undoubtedly the council

  we approached them feeling a bit
nervous perhaps mostly because of the
occasion when intelligent beings of two
widely separated worlds were to converse
in the same language for the first time
we were curious too to find out just
where this new world was located with
reference to our own

  greetings men from earth said the
spokesman his voice was resonant but
the words were rather unpleasantly harsh
we know that you as well as we are
curious about the details of this visit you
have made us at considerable risk to
yourselves

  there were fifteen fyns in the council
group with four recording clerks

  please be seated and the spokesman
waved a tenacle toward four chairs be-
fore a small table

  we were asked about our status on the
earth of other intelligent animals or
plants if there were any of our means

of transportation our weapons and our
social structure after an hour the
spokesman told us we were at liberty to
ask questions of them he was courteous
in the extreme and sincere i am certain
the dean asked for an explanation of
the transmission and also just where we
were

in reply the fyn said as for where
your world is located with reference
to ours we cannot tell star maps are
being brought here so that you may be
able to identify at least some of your
constellations as for your visit we ac-
cidentally captured your radio frequency
radiation during our first experiments
our beam was locked to yours so that
your beam could not escape us by
means of separators we were able to
capture the thought auras of three of
you the fourth stronger than yours
some days later these followed you
continuously we could sense good in-
telligence at the ends of the beams and
we awaited for indications of the most
receptive conditions usually during sleep
for transfers of thought waves

  thought a complex wave itself can
be made to modulate a radio frequency
carrier of relatively high frequency just
as of audio frequencies instead of true
demodulation the brain follows both
sides of the envelope without changing
the carrier in the least four of us trans-
ferred thought to your men we found
it possible also by high frequency mix-
tures in proper proportions to break
down molecular structures until the mol-
ecular bonds were completely balanced
and to transmit them as waves to be again
set up at a suitable receiver as they were
before transmission

  we concluded that beings employing
ultra-high radio frequencies would be of
sufficient intelligence to grasp the true
meanings of the thoughts we transmitted
to them with the results that you con-


amazing stories

structed the required apparatus for two-
way communication our neighbors the
rus are working along similar lines but
our secret is so closely guarded that their
spies cannot learn it but they do know
the ultimate results we have advanced
beyond you in the use of higher radia-
tions which have supplanted all projectile
weapons which you say you still use
wars will cease on your world when rays
come into common use because of their
terrible destructive powers

  atomic power is supplanting atomic
hydrogen engines slowly as your instruc-
tors no doubt told you we are happy to
know that you have progressed far
enough to have made some little use of
atomic gases the field of application is
wide indeed second only to the ultimate
utilization of the atoms energy as for
the cosmic radiation of which you speak
its secret is still locked from us though
we know its results from the building up
of matter the entire universe is grow-
ing rather than dying

  at this point the star maps were
brought in but there were no similarities
to any of the constellations as we knew
them we must have been many light
years from our galaxy

  your measurement continued die
fyn of forty units of distance in forty
units of time is not clear to us

  kroelich and the professor showed the
approximate distance along the floor and
showed the interval of time on the latters
watch

eemingly preposterous to you
gentlemen said the fyn after care-
fully considering the facts yet time
does not exist in reality all methods of
measuring a given interval are relative
just as space itself space is curved and
warped just as time may be yet it is
nothing in the universe or to it you
pick an interval and yet time was before
and is after it cannot be captured or

changed in any manner the transmis-
sion might even have twisted you into
another dimensional plane however un-
likely

  then came more questions from us and
more from the fyns

  after several hours the spokesman
said you men will be accorded all priv-
ileges for you are after all dependent
on us for a safe return we hope you
will delay this for many days while you
look over our city and visit our land you
need feel no fear of kidnaping now be-
cause we are keeping extra lookouts
weapons and ships will be placed at your
disposal the former if you should choose
to go into our beautiful forests your
freedom is unlimited and we hope you
will pass the time happily we are de-
lighted that we have been able to save
the life of one of you

  details must be omitted because of
space but we viewed the giant central
power station where atomic hydrogen en-
gines hissed shrilly as they pumped the
water generated the light-flux and con-
verted their mechanical energy into elec-
tric energy for the entire nations uses
though horsepower to horsepower they
were one hundredth the size of our power
convertors they towered fifty feet above
us and covered acres of floor space the
energy released was inconceivable to us

  we saw the park and the imposing
skyline formed by towering yet graceful
buildings against a carmine background

  those trees are blue or im color-
blind exclaimed pearson

  indeed the foliage was as well as the
sward which covered the grounds

yellow sun said the dean
our own sun is red hence green
foliage the apparent light is white but
in true color it is red complementary
colors always a blue sun would un-
doubtedly lead to yellow chlorophyl on
its planets
beam transmission



  what a picture against the red sky
at one edge of the city was a sheer wall
of brilliant blue rock miles beyond were
the mines and farther some lesser settle-
ments the vehicle we used was driven
by an atomic hydrogen engine no larger
than a watch the body therefore varied
considerably in shape and size from the
earthly automobile many men and fyns
were on foot i never could watch the
latter roll along on their disc-like bodies
and suction cups using their tentacles as
guides without a creepy sensation within
me

  im for visiting the forests for real
thrills ive always wanted to be a big
game hunter and this looks like the
chance i said that evening after an
extremely interesting day

  the others were all for it so we made
known our plans to the man who brought
our evening meal to us

  it shall be arranged gentlemen he
said

  mighty obliging lot observed pear-
son after he had left the room

  after breakfast the next morning the
attendant brought four belts with him
holding weapons new to us he ex-
plained they were ray guns and showed
us how to use them cautioning us against
carelessness because of their great range
and power we were asked to follow
him to the roof where our ships awaited
us they were tiny bullet-shaped one-
man ships with rocket tubes  thought
mounted at different angles over the out-
side shell

  instructions first said the man and
led us to a larger ship which we entered
two men were at the controls one oper-
ating them and the other explaining them

  as we sailed over the city and maneu-
vered the functions of the controls were
oudined to us they were so simple that
in half an hour we returned to our own
ships knowing every detail of operation
the motive power on these ships was

furnished by atomic hydrogen jets re-
leased through the various tubes the
amounts and the positions of the tubes
employed determined the direction and
velocity of travel an elevation indicator
speed indicator and a compass were the
sole instruments on the panel

we entered our tiny ships which
weighed perhaps four hundred
pounds and we rose slowly feeling more
confident as we experimented with the
controls now and then one of us would
dart off unexpectedly due to our inex-
perience but in fifteen minutes we could
maneuver quite expertly

  the tops of the cabins could be pushed
back from the cockpits so we could con-
verse if the distance between speakers
were not too great the only sound from
the ships was a slight hiss from the rocket
tubes

  from our elevation we had spread
under us a startling view beautiful in
the extreme probably because of the
extraordinary colorations no doubt to
one of these beings green foliage and a
blue sky would be just as entrancing the
vast forests spread below and beyond the
blue cliffs we had seen in various shades
of blue while lighter patches denoted
openings in the forest often following
streams for many miles

  we reduccd our speed and lowered
our ships to just clear the tops of the
tallest trees thus we drifted slowly
above them there was a distinct aroma-
tic odor from the forest most pleasant
to our sense of smell soon we came to
a large rocky clearing a bright yellow
patch in contrast to the field of blue we
lowered our craft gently and stepped to
the earth

  the yellow coloration was due to a sort
of sandstone fragments of which cov-
ered several acres forming a low hill
we walked to the edge of the forest and
felt a cool inviting breath from the


amazing stories

gloomy depths we had been told there
were no longer any formidable beasts on
the island with the exception of two va-
rieties of venomous reptiles which we
might encounter both made considerable
noise before attacking and could easily
be dispatched before they could come
within striking distance

  odd flowers grew upon the soft leaf
mold under the trees while vines hung
from them their tendrils deeply imbedded
in the soft bark partaking of the sap
we were enchanted and wandered miles
from the clearing suddenly there was a
deep rumble of thunder we concluded
that we had best return if we wished to
keep our clothes dry as we retreated
the thunder became louder and more fre-
quent drops of rain fell here and there
between the trees

  by the time we reached the clearing
the lightning was illuminating the black
sky with such frequent flashes that there
was seldom darkness the rain had
started in earnest a stiff wind was
roaring through the forest all about us
swaying the tops of the trees violently
the dean and kroelich were first to reach
their ships and hurriedly pulled their
cabin tops over them

  pearson and i were not much behind
them and soon all of us were rising
kroelich and harvey above they were
suddenly caught in the gale and hurled
sideways helpless pearson saw them
hurtled away over the tree tops too and
both of us settled down just before we
had reached the tree tops no use to bat-
tle that storm for if it were like an earth-
ly thunder storm it would last only a
short while we settled close together and
waited the rain was falling in such tor-
rents that the forest edge could not be
seen the electric display had almost
ceased soon i could no longer make out
pearsons ship in the terrific downpour

  after perhaps ten minutes the flood
began to lessen and i peered out the

rain was still too heavy to see pearson
but i did see his ship i looked a second
time yes his cabin was open what
had he done regardless of the rain
which was still falling i pushed open my
hatch and jumped to the ground he was
not in the ship certainly he would not
have gone into the forest i saw too
footprints of mens shoes in the stiff clay
with evidences of a struggle and there
was his ray pistol at one side

  i shouted his name again and again
the rain had ceased and the sun was
shining through the thinning clouds i
looked about the clearing and saw an-
other ship half turned over against a
rock i grasped my pistol and ran to it
inside was an inert figure slumped in
the seat the ship must have been hurled
to the earth by the wind while the rain
was falling heaviest

i had some difficulty in opening the
roof since the car had been badly
warped by the fall but i finally forced it
open with a rock far enough to grasp
the pilot under the shoulders and hoist
him out it was a girl unconscious or
perhaps even dead to judge from the
color of her face i dipped my handker-
chief in a puddle of water formed in a
hollowed rock and wiped her face with
it she was not dead for i could feel
her pulse and detect her breathing soon
she groaned and opened her eyes she
did not speak but bit her lips to keep
from crying out pointing to her right
leg i removed the boot she was wearing
the first i had seen on sar and found
her leg had been fractured just above
the ankle

  while i was thus occupied i heard
shouts from behind and found that kroe-
lich and the professor had returned
safely i breathed a sigh of relief that
no harm had befallen them they ran
toward me thinking some harm had come
to pearson when they saw that it was
beam transmission



a girl beside me they asked the where-
abouts of our companion

  he just disappeared i said when
the rain had stopped sufficiently for me
to make out his ship i saw the cabin top
was open he must have been captured
by someone for there are footprints in
the mud about the ship

  they went over to it and began shout-
ing his name the girls ship was hope-
lessly wrecked so i carefully carried her
to mine and made her as comfortable as
i could in the small cabin i was just
able to squeeze in myself the ship rose
with a very noticeable effort due to the
unusual load kroelich and the dean had
finally given up the search and were fol-
lowing me soon passing us on their way
to the city to report the kidnaping

  when i landed on the roof of the
building scouts were already on their
way to the forest clearing the girl
whose name was lele was carried below
to receive the necessary medical attention

hat has happened to him
asked kroelich anxiously cer-
tainly no sarian would do a thing like
that we have just been told that no
enemy craft has been sighted either yet
the prints were those of men

  we waited on the roof top for the
most part silent i went below to ques-
tion the girl after being directed to the
surgical room i found her resting after
the splints had been put in place she
said she had seen nothing and heard no
more she frequently flew over the for-
ests landing often and wandering about
in the solitude her ship had been seized
by the gale and hurled into the clearing
during the heaviest downpour of rain

  as she spoke i noticed that she was
pretty in spite of the pain-drawn features

  are you by any chance quartered in
this building lele i asked

  yes she said i was one of the atten-
dants in the laboratory when your blood

specimens were taken some days ago

  i hope i may see you while you are
convalescing i ventured

  i should be very happy and she
gave me her apartment number i must
thank you again for your extreme kind-
ness in rescuing me and she extended
her hand i hope you hear of your
partners safety shortly

  i felt strangely elated her hand had
been so soft and warm the touch of
which sent a tingling sensation running
riot along my spine

  i returned to our underground apart-
ment elated on one hand depressed on
the other the professor and kroelich
were both awaiting me the latter pacing
the floor shortly after i had entered
there was a knock at the door

a man entered and reported the
council wishes to inform you gen-
tlemen that pearson is being held in
poru unharmed he will be returned
to-morrow it is thought the abductors
will be caught before they can make good
their escape the message sent was sar-
castic in tone the essence of it being that
since the men from another world were
not permitted to taste the hospitality of
poru it had been forced upon one of
them at least

  any further news will be given you
on receipt with that the messenger
left

  and the sarians saw no enemy ships
i must say they are far from observant
it must have been a big one too carrying
half a dozen men fine chance they have
of capturing them when they return if
they did not see them leave i said

  im glad hes at least safe exclaimed
kroelich with relief

  the professor agreed with a nod
there is something behind this outside
of hospitality i hope pearson comes to
no harm

  the next morning i paid lele a visit


amazing stories

as i had promised she was resting
easily and was cheerful she was a pretty
girl no mistaking that and she was like
all women i had ever known a coquette
after her man though i wondered why
it should be i

  an answer to a knock on the door re-
vealed kroelich pearsons back hes
reporting to the fyn council now

  im so glad said lele go to him
bell

  i said goodbye and left pearson had
already returned from the council room
and had begun his story

ithout a warning three men
in suits opened the top of my ship
and dragged me out bodily i shouted
and tried to use my pistol but it was
knocked from my hand and i was
dragged to a ship resting near mine on
the side away from bells i was securely
bound but otherwise not maltreated we
passed within fifty yards of a sarian pa-
trol ship but they didnt see us one of
the pilots grinned and motioned to the
effect that the sarians were fools

  fellows that ship had been rendered
invisible tliat is the new weapon of
poru

  after landing i was told to put on a
suit and then i was led from the roof-
top to a laboratory much the same as the
one here put in a glass cage and a blood
sample was taken the poruvians know
ol the sarian scheme and wanted to de-
velop antitoxins i dont think they know
about the cancer and catalyst develop-
ment but they were certain they had our
secret after my rough treatment i told
them nothing their manner was mock-
ing but they did not try any physical
abuse

  i spent the night in a single room
in the morning i was to be taken back
to sar the land of eternal fools i had
been permitted to remove my suit which
certainly does speak for their medical

supremacy over sar for they must have
inoculated the entire population in twelve
hours which included developing the de-
fensive serums

   you shall see more of us earth-
man said a rus as i entered the ele-
vator to the roof

  the invisible ship crossed the city of
sar and landed right in the park i was
unceremoniously dumped to the lawn and
the ship was gone in a moment i was
discovered by the sarians and the scouts
arose in swarms to catch the enemy but
what chance had they unless they
accidentally rammed it and here i
am

  at least the council of fyns had some-
thing to think about now for they did
not have the key to unlock the process of
invisibility that was something to worry
about without questionanother thought
suddenly entered my mind what if an
invisible ship of poru should bomb the
building which housed the sarian trans-
mitter our only link to the earth  surely
the spies knew the location of it i be-
came very uneasy and the more i thought
about it the more nervous i became

  the sarian cultures were slower in
growth than had been anticipated but re-
ports had it that enough cancer culture to
attack the enemy would be ready by early
evening the incubation was being
forced to the utmost the sarians could
not now wait for an attack of the poru-
vian invisible air forces

  lele was waiting for me on crutches
im so glad you came she dropped
her eyes

  i am too i said i wanted so much
to see you

  in reply she blushed prettily but said
nothing

  i found my three companions in our
underground suite and hastily approached
the subject foremost in my mind

  before hell breaks loose i want to
get out of here weve been here long
beam transmission



enough to cause trouble and im going
i concluded

  its all right bell said the dean
we shall not want to miss a few
glimpses of the battle a battle we shall
never see duplicated what colossal en-
gines of destruction these beings must
have in readiness

perhaps it would be worth the risk
if the battle came too close we could
depart in a few seconds we sent a mes-
sage to calloway to stand by all night
if necessary for we would return that
night i called lele over the phonovisor
and asked her if we could safely view
the conflict she said we could for ad-
joining the transmitter room was a giant
screen on which images over a wide field
and unlimited distance could be projected
the attack would be launched from sar
within an hour and she told us we might
find it interesting to watch the sarian
ships prepare for their deadly missions

  i went to leles apartment and as-
sisted her as best i could we rose to
the roof and found the professor pear-
son and kroelich already there where
thousands of picked troops formed a cor-
don under a canopy which had been
stretched over the entire square mile of
roof-top a thousand bullet-like atomic
planes stood in line their red sleek
stream-lined sides glistening in the arti-
ficial lighting under the cover small
glass bombs of the terrible cancer cells
with their catalyst were being attached to
the bomb droppers inside the ships what
untold horrors were these ships with their
single pilots some fyns some men at
least half of these small craft were radio
controlled faster and more deadly by far
than the others the acceleration of
those having living pilots was limited by
the human factor as was the maneuver-
ability not so with the radio-controlled
ships they could speed up to a tenth
the velocity of light in thirty seconds and

could dip and turn with such great speed
that no living being could exist in them

  after loading the ships were lined up
at the far edge of the roof preparatory
to taking off on their sinister missions
then one by one the long slender ray
ships dropped under the canopy and took
on their full compliments of waiting men
and fyns a hundred to a ship there
were four hundred of these yet all were
manned and poised behind the smaller
ships in three-quarters of an hour these
were to withstand the brunt of the de-
fense the rus would put up and to allow
as many as possible of the torpedo ships
to break through the protective screen
walls which would be erected about the
strongholds of poru in these ray ships
were the men and fyns who would con-
trol the radio-directed ships these four
hundred ships were not the last for the
secondary ships were being manned one
by one ships of various uses with special
rays and destructive powers

t et us go below to the screen said
lele as the secondary offensive
planes were being manned and pulled
into position behind the ray ships the
attack will be launched by the time we
get there

  when we had reached the room and
lele had made the proper adjustments
the ships were already leaving the roof top

  the night is very clear she com-
mented and we shall not miss any
details

  the receiving beam followed the van-
guard accurately under leles skilled fin-
gers as the miles flew by the magnifi-
cation kept pace but very little definition
was lost

  half way to the island of poru some-
thing happened suddenly and to us un-
expectedly the tiny bullet-like torpedo
ships in twos and threes grew luminous
and then incandescent brilliant white
spots appeared and the tough metal sides


amazing stories

melted off in great blobs the ray ships
hurtled ahead as the torpedo craft all
slowed down no enemy ships were visi-
ble but those heat rays were not capable
of transmission for many thousands of
feet the great emerald and violet and
blue rays beautiful to see slowly cov-
ered the sky above and the ocean below
suddenly a luminous glow appeared it
was an enemy ship caught in a ray al-
though it had been almost invisible when
it attacked the torpedo ships it writhed
and twisted in the beam from the ray ship
but could not escape the nimble fingers
of the sarian operator another ray
joined the first and gradually the real
outline of the green poruvian ship be-
came visible as the invisibility screen
broke down under the tremendous energy
of the beams

  a third ray a repulsive ray lele said
shot out to the ship it writhed for a
moment and then whirled away a sud-
den scream rent the air for miles as a
fourth ray from the sarian ship stabbed
the night a vacuum ray which caught
the ship as it was being hurled farther
away it flattened as the last ray pulled
the ship irresistibly against the repulsive
ray the rays released the ill-fated at-
tacker which fell to the sea with no life
remaining aboard

  but more sarian torpedo ships were
falling other invisible enemies were at
work their numbers increasing steadily
apparently the ray ships were being at-
tacked now though their protective
screens were holding

  then a change in the formation of the
sarians was made the ray ships formed
a cube with the torpedo craft inside
again the relentless advance continued i
was struck by the lack of strategy and
foresight at any time the invisible en-
emy might pass on and attack sar lele
replied that the lust for battle so long
unsatisfied made both nations crazed
with the desire to wreak havoc each upon

the other the thrill would be lacking if
sar were attacked unprotected

  every now and then an enemy ship
would be caught in the maze of rays
spread out by the larger sarian ships but
the increasing number of glaring spots
on the protective screens of the latter
told of hundreds of invisible ships it
seemed to me that the poruvians were
not using their new weapon to the best
advantage the long peaceful era had
certainly brought about a decay of battle
tactics

   in the distance a faigt green glow ap-
peared

   the protective screen wall about the
island of poru explained lele it will
have to be broken down before any of
our ships can pass through

   now there were more brilliant splashes
of color on the ray ship screens the
rays were bringing into visibility the
great ships of poru awaiting the armada
from sar

  i he real battle begins here and

   -i- now i said aloud

  the cube formation changed to a cyl-
inder with the open end toward the de-
fensive ray screen of the poruvians the
forward ships of sar concentrated their
rays upon a single spot hoping to break
down the screen to give an opening for
the torpedo ships ships of poru hoped
otherwise for they immediately began a
concentrated attack on the foremost craft
of the cylindrical formation

   after several ships had gone directly
between the sarians and the screen and
been instantly vaporized by the concentra-
tion of rays the remainder stayed well
outside of the path the screen of the
poruvians was becoming very dense about
the attacking fleet being barely visible a
hundred yards away what an opening it
was but the torpedoes were all inside of
the formation and could not take advan-
tage of it the protective wall could
beam transmission



have been broken down with very few
beams i was sure it was holding the
sarians at the point of attack however

  the poruvians now adopted the tac-
tics of the attackers half a dozen ships
directing their concentrated rays on a
sarian ship screens of the latter flared
brilliantly great flames of energy shoot-
ing into the air for hundreds of yards
now came the special sarian ray ships
rushing to the aid of the larger craft
attacking the poruvians from the flank
with this new menace many of the latter
turned from attempting the destruction
of the cylindrical formation to fight off
this new enemy these special ray ships
were small and nimble with only one
special ray as a weapon and small pro-
tective screens they were forced to keep
out of the way of the larger ships

  we soon saw that the enemy had such
ships in his fleet with the result that dog-
fights ensued with the most spectacular
displays of rays and coruscations beau-
tiful to see but terrible in their destruc-
tive powers millions upon millions of
horsepower were being expended in those
few cubic miles of space just off the
island of poru screams of vacuum rays
and crackling of protective screens fight-
ing off attacking rays made a din which
even at our distance we had never before
imagined ship after ship dropped
molten masses after the slightest breaks
in their screens

  the forces were too evenly matched
for progress in either direction that
wall must be penetrated soon or no tor-
pedo ships would reach the island a
change in formation suddenly appeared
with a double layer of sarian ray ships
at the attacking end of the cylinder half
of the torpedo craft were left unprotected
by this change in formation disappear-
ing almost instantaneously as the poru-
vians rayed them

  now the screen was flaming miles high
at any moment it might break down a

deep rumble rose above the already terri-
fic roar the ray ships trembling from
stem to stern lele explained that they
were making the last attempt liberating
energy at an inconceivable rate their
supplies would be gone in a very few
minutes at this rate and they would be
helpless before the enemy-rays it was
the last straw the roar grew as the
visor screen before us grew misty the
heat must have been terrific for the
ocean was boiling and steaming for miles
around from the secondary radiations
alone

  with a tremendous blaze of glaring
white light the island screen snapped
instantly a solid stream of torpedo ships
were through probably eight or nine of
them before the screen again closed one
by one the sarian ships cut their rays
they flared incandescent and dropped
writhing to the boiling ocean below they
had accomplished their missions soon
none were left and the special ray ships
bearing the brunt of the attack of the
whole poruvian navy suddenly ceased
fighting and hurtled back for sar in
pursuit came the invisible fleet intent on
finally reducing sar they could not
know that in a few hours they would be
the only living poruvians and when they
returned to poru victorious they too
would contract a horrible death

chills ran up and down my spine
how long would our protective
screen hold the hordes with no navy to
aid us vengeance of the poruvians
would be horrible life on sar would
end just as life on poru was ending even
now lele trembled as she followed the
retreat and the advance a few auxiliary
ships of sar were coming to the useless
attack of an invisible enemy without
even noticing the attackers the ships of
poru massed before the screen of sar
all of their noses in one plane while a
hundred biting hissing rays concentrated


amazing stories

on the screen in one spot the end was
near minute after minute the screen re-
sisted that terrific onslaught and then
it split wide open ship after ship poured
through the break which did not mend
all of this only a few miles from us

  minor defenses of the city formidable
in themselves flared upward illuminating
the sky to meet the poruvians we be-
gan to hear the rumbling and felt the
trembling of falling buildings soon the
hiss of the rays was audible through the
closed windows of the room and the en-
emy ships came into actual view i looked
about shouting that we must go the
professor was gone

  there was a terrific roar and crash that
threw us from our feet the lights were
out the central power plant was gone
and our screen was blank our building
would be attacked very shortly i grabbed
for leles hand and shouted to my com-
panions to the transmitter

  i felt weak and dizzy from the suffo-
cating acrid fumes of ozone and decom-
posed metals and rock was the trans-
mitter supplied from the central power
plant was death only a matter of
minutes 

  lele led us unerringly through the door
to the next room and by the brilliant
lighting from the rapidly nearing battle
we could clearly see the controls dean
hafvey was already there throwing them
in the filaments were lighted thank
god the building was shaking violently
as we waited for the switches to be closed
there was no time to be lost

  hurry professor i shouted

 there was no argument as to who
would be first to return to the earth since
time was precious and could not be
wasted in argument if we all expected to
return the dean disappeared and pear-
son jumped to the pedestal

  lele i called

  she looked at me with tears in her
eyes hurry she said goodbye

  goodbye i exclaimed in horror
you are next

  who will operate the controls the
last cannot be saved

  kroelich sensing my idea grasped her
by the wrist as i did and together we
carried her to the pedestal

  for my sake dont bell dont she
screamed hysterically

  kroelich waited i would lose my
hands and arms if i had to hold her she
would not stop struggling time was
precious i clenched my fist closed my
eyes and struck her on the chin

  the building was rocking violently now
as the enemy ships were silencing ray
after ray of the sarians as lele
slumped down i moved back and she was
gone as kroelich threw the switch

ext i shouted to be heard above
the increasing noise of battle
your wife and children want you and
ill be right after you

  he waited only an instant grasped my
hand and sat on the pedestal i closed
the switch and he was gone leaving me
alone on this strange world in dire peril
of instant annihilation

  there was a great crashing above and
great cracks were widening in the walls
of the room they had reached the
building the windows broke open ad-
mitting a hot blast and choking fumes
i must take my one chance for life now
or never i left the last switch closed and
leaped headlong for the pedestal as i
did so the ceiling of the room split wide
open and great pieces of concrete fell
toward me then all was black

  my next sensation was one of terrible
agony i could hear the roars and crashes
of the battle the screaming vacuum rays
the flashes of incandescent screens then
i saw the body of lele lying on the
floor beside me had she come back to
me i must have struck her too hard
and killed her i screamed through
beam transmission



the opening in the ceiling three rus were
training their ray pistols on me why
hadnt they died of cancer simultane-
ously they fired with a blinding flash of
white light i felt myself disintegrate
but it was not painful in the least i was
still conscious i tried to open my eyes
the pain was coming back the din was
growing fainter so this was death
would i drift forever in this state

  everything was perfectly still now so
quiet that my ears were ringing a faint
sound was disturbing this peaceful quiet
a sobbing sound with a sudden mighty
effort i opened my eyes they burned
frightfully as i did all over i could see
nothing but i did hear a murmur of
voices nearby and something cold touched
my forehead i closed my eyes once
moie

  bell someone knew me perhaps
another drifting soul

  bell and that sobbing

  i wondered where i had heard that
voice before i opened my eyes with great
effort and this time i saw something
directly above me i realized i was flat
on my back slowly my vision was clear-
ing and i made out the face of lele

  are you dead too i whispered in
sarian

  no no she answered we are all
safe

safe was i not dead i moved my
head slightly and saw pearson kroe-
lich and the professor all smiling through
tears they moved closer to me i turned
my head to the other side as i felt a
prick in my arm several doctors were
standing there one of whom was admin-
istering a hypodermic injection i turned
to see the others once more the pain
was driving me mad

  where am i i asked helplessly

  back to earth said pearson in en-
glish you were cracked up a bit but
youll be all right in short order bell

  the hypo was taking effect for i felt
numbness in my hands and feet and dim-
ming of consciousness so all i had ex-
perienced had been a delirious dream

  pearsons short order was only a
matter of three months had it not been
for lele i should never have walked
again i had made the transmitter all
right and i had been transmitted with a
half ton of masonry on top of me just
before the sarian transmitter was
wrecked

  when i could again hobble about on
crutches with the aid of lele i felt more
like my old self for three or four days
my companions had hot visited me of
course i was happy to have lele with
me all of the time but i did miss the
daily visits of my partners lele pre-
tended ignorance but i could tell she was
keeping some secret from me

  somebody was coming down the gar-
den walk ah pearson harvey and
kroelich it had been weeks since all of
them had come together to see me

  very seriously pearson unrolled a
sheet of paper and giving me his foun-
tain pen said sign on the dotted line

  are you going to collect my insur-
ance i asked just as seriously

  sign he answered threateningly

  i attempted to unroll the manuscript
but he held it tightly with an oh
well i wrote my name at the bottom
of the page lele clapped her hands like
a little girl the three men bowed

  thank you mr president they said
as one man

  say whats the idea i asked my
curiosity fully aroused

  see for yourself exclaimed kroe-
lich taking the paper from pearson and
unrolling it before me

for a moment i was stupefied at
the top was beam transmis-
sion incorporated it dawned

on me finally

worst enemies

the full moon with lele beside me the
evening before our wedding day atoms
were strange things and how tiny the
electrons circling the proton i looked
up at the stars each a sun with its planets
what a relative thing size was what
countless millions upon millions upon mil-
lions of them and yet a single electron
alone might hold untold wonders

in place of our usual lines of introduction the amusing poem which follows
we are sure will be appreciated by our readers as an interesting substitute

                           written by the author

i read a yarn the other day-

a crazy concept i must say

it states that objects have extension
in what is called the fourth dimen-

    	if

in hyperspace one could no doubt
make tennis balls turn inside out
and from a nut remove the kernel
and not disturb the shell external

gentleman to see you
mr underwood my sec-
retary announced

  i was busy i was wor-
ried i was grumpy the
immediate task confronting me was a
ticklish one desperately in need of cash
to take care of pressing obligations i was
trying to dictate a super-collection letter
the trick of the thing was to make my
request for payment of a past due ac-
count both forceful and diplomatic so
that it would extract a check painlessly
and immediately without offending a
valuable client or betraying my own
financial weakness

hanging up the mouthpiece of my dic-
taphone  said wearily please tell our

 a crook could pilfer bonds and stocks
 then laugh at prison bars and locks
 one step in this direction queer
 and presto he would disappear

 lets hope in planning new inventions
 theyll give us cars with four dimen
 sions

when searching for a parking place
we sure could use some hyperspace

burning oil and feel the hot breath of the smoke which puffed through the

  cracks in the floor board of the car
the four dimensional auto-parker	

ond thought  go out there and escort
him into my office personally

  i was right behind her as she opened
the door so suddenly did she halt that
i nearly bumped into her pointing in
dismay at the vacant chair in the waiting
room she moaned oh dear he did
get away

  she was contradicted by a resonant
bass voice which boomed out from behind
us with a suddenness that made us both
jump

  no im still here the voice rumbled

  i wasnt exactly afraid but i could feel
my scalp tingle as i turned and con-
fronted the owner of that mysterious
voice he was standing between me and
my desk in a spot which i had passed
over just a few seconds before

  in a terrified voice the girl mumbled
something that sounded like thats the
man who wants to see you and fled
slamming the door behind her

  my visitors voice had surprised me
his appearance was even more startling
he didnt look like a prospective client
for a reputable advertising agency of
ordinary height his figure had several
incongruities supported on long spin-
dling legs was a veritable barrel of a
chest surmounted by a pair of egregiously
broad shoulders and an amazingly large
head it was almost totally bald that
head but its lack of hirsute covering
seemed to be compensated for by an en-
ormous moustache which gave to the
mans visage a fierce military appearance
conspicuous as this facial appendage was
it was overshadowed by the eyes of my
visitor which were abnormally large and
protuberant this effect was intensified
by the large concave lenses of his horn-
rimmed spectacles altogether it was a
preposterous face-one not easily for-
gotten

  i hope i didnt scare you he snick-
ered

  of course not was my indignant
denial naturally i was a bit surprised
i cant understand how you got in here
without my seeing you

  illexplain that presently when you
told your girl to show me in i heard you
and stepped inside without waiting for
any further invitation but perhaps i
ought to introduce myself my name is
socrates thoroughgood and i assume
that you are-

  remington underwood at your serv
ice mr thoroughgood my secretary
informed me that you are looking for an
agency to handle your advertising
that is correct i realize that in order
to introduce a new product speedily it is
necessary to use publicity advertising
is a matter for specialists thats why i
came to you

  thank you mr thoroughgood and
may i ask the nature of this new product
which you wish to advertise

  before i answer that permit me to
ask you a question

  certainly fire away

  what is it that this country needs
most to-day

  dont tell me that you manufacture
five cent cigars i countered

  of course not he snapped please
answer my question what is it that the
country needs most to-day

  well if you want me to give you an
honest expression of opinion i would say
this what the country needs most today
is some substitute for money that can be
obtained easily and painlessly is that
the right answer

  ridiculously not

  then please tell me im not very
good at riddles

glaring at me with his baleful
myopic eyes and accentuating his
words by jabbing toward my nose with
a hairy index finger he declared what


amazing stories

the country needs today is hyper-
space

  hyperspace i gasped
hyperspace he nodded solemnly
hyperspace i repeated what in
the name of depression is hyperspace
he elevated the ends of his moustache
leading me to suspect that he was smiling
although i could not see his mouth

  ah was his triumphant cry now
we are getting somewhere you admit
you are ignorant you have received the
torpedo shock you are now ready to
listen and learn my reason for punc-
tuating his speech entirely with what ad-
vertising men call squealers is that all
his sentences sounded like exclamations

  why yes i stammered yes yes
of course i am always glad to learn
something new please tell me about this
hyperspace of yours

  i assume that you have heard of the
fourth dimension he inferred

  vaguely i told him ive heard that
einstein uses a fourth dimension in fig-
uring out his theories unfortunately i
dont happen to be one of the twelve men
who understand einstein

  the fourth dimension is really quite
simple he informed me anybody can
understand it-even an advertising man
like yourself

  thank you i retorted in a tone
meant to be sarcastic perhaps you will
be good enough to explain it to me

  i cant take the time to go into the
details now briefly the fourth dimen-
sion is just an extension of space like
length width and height ordinary hu-
man beings have the idea that every
object in the world possesses only three
dimensions they call them by various
names such as breadth thickness and
altitude and they assume that these three
dimensions represent the absolute limits
of space beyond which it is impossible to
go as a matter of fact however every

object in the universe animate and inani
mate really has four dimensions

  who said so

   i said so

  that of course settles the matter for
all time was my sarcastic rejoinder i
dont suppose that the opinions of great
mathematicians who assert that there is
no such thing as a fourth dimension are
worthy of consideration since they do not
agree with yours

  i expected this to nettle him but he
only made a silly grimace and said it
is true that some of the mathematicians
like manning and sidlis who have
worked on problems of non-euclidian
geometry believe that their speculations
are purely empirical and have no bearing
on the world as it really is on the
other hand there is at least one eminent
authority who believes that the fourth
dimension actually exists and who ad-
vances convincing evidence to support
this belief

  and i suppose his name is thorough-
good i remarked in an ironical tone

  im not the only one did you ever
hear of c howard hinton ma

  i shook my head

  then id advise you to read his book
entitled the fourth dimension hinton
devotes a considerable portion of this
work to scientific proof that the fourth
dimension actually exists let me give
you an example

  before i realized what he was going
to do thoroughgood had ripped two or
three sheets from my desk calendar on
which i had jotted down several im-
portant engagements then he lifted my
gold-mounted fountain pen from its onyx
base inserted a dirty finger-nail under
the jigger that operates the filling device
and squirted a stream of ink from the
business end of the pen some of the
ink spattered all over a drawing which
had cost me thirty-five dollars but thor-
the four dimensional auto-parker



oughgood didnt so much as ay excuse
me

  he quickly folded one of the slips of
paper pressing it flat with his thumb
opening up the paper he pointed to the
blot of ink which had assumed a fan-
tastic shape resembling a cross between
an octopus and a butterfly

there he exclaimed there you
have an example of bilateral symmetry
what am i supposed to do i
sneered kiss you or swoon with de-
light

  disregarding my sarcasm he contin-
ued cant you see the significance of
this experiment  it proves that symmetry
in a two-dimensional object-in other
words symmetry with respect to a line-
may logically be explained as being due
to a folding process which can only be
performed by moving the object through
a higher dimension

 you seem to be using english
words was my impertinent comment
the only trouble is that they dont
make sense

  i see i must make allowances for an
untutored mind he came back at me
perhaps an analogy will make the
point clearer imagine yourself to be

absolutely flat as for instance-

  that wont require any imagination
i interrupted him since the bank hol-
iday was declared i am absolutely flat-
as flat as a mexican tortilla if not more
so

t ery well let us suppose you are
v a two dimensional being suppose
you saw a number of ink blots like
this one-what would your natural in-
ference be

  that some moron had been monkey-
ing with a fountain pen i replied

  he went right on even though you
lived in a two dimensional world and
were unable to move in a third dimen-
sion yourself it would be possible for

you-or rather for a person of intel-
ligence-to figure out that these sym-
metrical figures were produced by fold-
ing the paper through a third dimen-
sion using a line as the axis of rota-
tion is that dear

  if it will make you feel any bet-
ter suppose you assume that it is and
now im afraid you will have to ex-
cuse me i have a very important-
he cut in with this is the most im-
portant thing that ever came to your
attention i havent finished the least
you can do is listen

  all right i sighed but please
come to the point

  presently let me call your atten-
tion to an extremely significant fact
symmetry with respect to a line is com-
mon we find it both in organic and in-
organic objects but there is another
type of symmetry i refer to symmetry
with respect to a plane did you ever
stop to consider that this type of sym-
metry is found only in organic objects-
in other words in objects which are
created by life

  i cant say that i have given much
thought to that consideration i told
him

  consider it now take your body
for instance he picked up from my
desk an oriental dagger which i had
just used to open my mail consisting
principally of bills and duns brand-
ishing the keen-edged weapon with a
menacing flourish he shouted imagine
this knife to be a huge cleaver suppose
i bring it down on your cranium and
split your body right through the mid-
dle

  as he said this he made a savage pass
at me with the dagger the point of it
came so close to my nose that i felt a
draft as it swished by startled and
completely caught off guard i leaped
backward stumbling over a waste paper


amazing stories

basket and crashing to the floor in a
most undignified manner

  ill have to give thoroughgood credit
for one thing he didnt laugh perhaps
he smiled a bit but if he did his expres-
sions of mirth were successfully cam-
ouflaged by the airdale vegetation on
his upper lip

  when i had scrambled to my feet he
went on as if nothing had happened
suppose your body was split in two
exact halves they would be remark-
ably symmetrical-that is with the ex-
ception of that wart over your left
eyebrow but observe this your body
is symmetrical-not with respect to a
line but with respect to a plane-in this
case the plane of cleavage

 assuming that symmetry may be

  lm explained as a result of a folding
process this suggests that your body
might have been formed by folding
but to produce this type of symmetry it
would be necessary to fold your body
on an axis which is not a line but a
plane folding of this kind is utterly
impossible in a three-dimensional world
but it could easily be accomplished if
you were able to move in a fourth di-
mension

  do you mean to say that you think
human bodies are actually folded in the
way you describe i exclaimed

  of course not you mustnt take my
explanations too literally what i mean
to imply is that symmetry with respect
to a plane such as is found in the hu-
man body and other living things in-
cluding flowers fruits vegetables and
so forth suggests a four dimensional
arrangement of the minute particles
from which the growing organism is
constructed is that clear

  as clear as pea soup i still dont
get what you are-

very well he interposed now
listen to this in proving the actual ex-

istence of the fourth dimension hinton

does not rest his case solely on the
evidence supplied by the phenomena of
symmetry after all the strongest ar-
gument is that offered by electricity
did you ever try to define electricity
oh yes indeed i replied blithely
defining electricity is my favorite in-
door sport

  very well lets hear you define elec-
tricity

  with pleasure i would say that elec-
tricity is a force which can be trans-
mitted by means of certain substances
called conductors and which may be
converted into heat light mechanical
energy and what have you

  not bad for a layman he grudging-
ly admitted your definition is about
as good as any which has been offered
so far but after all you really havent
even attempted to explain what elec-
tricity really is or how it is transmitted
along a conductor

  ive always understood that no one
knows what electricity is was my re-
joinder and also that nobody knows
how it travels through a conductor
not through he said in a manner
which suggested a school mam correct-
ing a stupid pupil one thing we do
know about electricity it doesnt travel
through a conductor but along it or
around it

  whats the difference i inquired
only this no scientist of the old
school has been able to explain satisfac-
torily why electricity behaves the way
it does this is because they are all
hedged about and restricted in their
reasoning by the conventional ideas of
space as possessing only three dimen-
sions hinton however shows that all
the phenonema of electricity can very
easily lie explained by presupposing the
existence of motion in a fourth dimen-
sion electricity is nothing more than
a four dimensional vortex motion in the
the four dimensional auto-parker



ether surrounding a conductor you

know what a vortex is do you not
sure i gtinned it wasnt so
long ago that we had to pay a vortex
on theater tickets

  very impolitely he wrinkled his nose
as if to inform me he regarded my
clever pun as belonging in the same cate-
gory as a bad smell then he went on
perhaps you do not know that when
a tornado or twister rushes through
the air or when a whirlpool travels
through a body of water the eddy is
made up of the same identical particles
of matter in other words it isnt a
case of motion being transmitted from
particles in one part of the medium to
those in another part but the same com-
ponents move along with the vortex as
it travels from place to place

 interesting if true i re-
 marked and so what

  ignoring my flippant question he pro-
ceeded  another significant fact is
that a vortex cannot remain suspended
and isolated in a fluid the ends of the
vortex must reach the boundary of the
fluid these boundaries may be ex-
ternal or internal for instance one end
may be on the surface and the other
end on the bottom of a river or the vor-
tex may extend between two objects in
the fluid terminating with one end on
each object but it is utterly impossible
for a vortex to remain half way in a
fluid without terminating in two boun-
daries of the fluid

  what about a smoke ring i re-
minded him isnt that vortex

  yes he admitted it is a vortex
with the ends united to form a circle
im glad you brought that up because
it illustrates the idea i am undertak-
ing to convey to you in a smoke ring
the particles are revolving like small
rings strung on a large ring in other

words the ring is repeatedly turning in-
side out that of course is possible in
three dimensions since the ring is sim-
ilar to a two dimensional object which
is being twisted through a third dimen-
sion

  the vortex motion which hinton
uses to explain electrical phenomena is
somewhat analogous to this movement
except that instead of moving in rings
the vortexes are in the shape of hollow
spheres which are constantly turning
inside-out to use a familiar analogy
the smoke ring is like a rubber band
being twisted while the vortex motion
of the electric current is like a tennis
ball which is being repeatedly turned
inside out

  which led me to say baron munch-
hausen told some good ones too
what i am telling you are facts not
fairy tales was his indignant response
but i can readily see that there is
little use for me to cast any more pearls
let it suffice to say that hintons theory
of four dimensional vortex motion in
the ether surrounding an electrical con-
ductor supplies a very logical and con-
vincing explanation of the way electricity
behaves i shall not burden you with
a complete exposition of this theory
for which i am very grateful to
you i said and by the way mr
thoroughgood now that you have fin-
ished your scholarly dissertation would
you mind answering a question or two
very well he condescended what
do you want to know

  as i understand it you wish to ad-
vertise a device which is based on this
fourth dimension which you have just
explained to me is that correct

  he nodded

  i see and i assume that you know
it costs money to advertise even a small
advertising campaign will cost several
thousand dollars are you in a position


amazing

stories

to take care of the financial end of your
sales and advertising program

  of course not he blandly informed
me thats why i came to you i was
told that you have connections with
wealthy people who are looking for
worthy enterprises in which to invest
their money i am willing to part with
a third interest in my invention for-
excuse me i cut in whoever told
you i could help in the financing of an
advertising campaign must have been a
historian it is true that i have done
something of the kind in the past-but
that was many years ago i suggest that
you read the newspapers perhaps you
may then become cognizant of the novel
fact that conditions are different now it
happens that i am extremely busy today
so i trust you will excuse me

ou talk as if you are trying to get
rid of me he said reproachfully
im glad you are intelligent enough
to take the hint i was still rankling a
bit over his insinuation concerning the
supposed stupidity of advertising men
please pardon my bluntness but i am
afraid it will be impossible to induce any-
one to gamble real money on an unproven
enterprise

  arent you jumping at conclusions
he intimated at least you can afford to
spend a few minutes in witnessing a dem-
onstration of my invention if you dont
you may live to regret it

  having had previous experiences with
inventors and knowing what persistent
pests they are i sighed resignedly and
said o k go ahead and demonstrate
but youll have to make it snappy
thank you mr underwood but
first if you dont mind it will be neces-
sary for me to add a word or two to the
explanation of hyperspace i gave you a
moment ago the best way to understand
the possibilities of the fourth dimension
is to consider what a three dimensional

consciousness would mean to a two-di-
mensional being

  imagine what such a creature would
look like totally flat not even as thick
as the thinnest tissue paper or gold leaf
absolutely incapable of moving away
from the single plane upon which he lives

  the home of such a being would be
like an architects floor plan mere out-
lines of rooms drawn in ink on a piece
of paper yet they would be ample to
provide shelter and privacy to imprison
him all you need to do is to draw a pencil
mark all around him unless he can find
some way to penetrate the thin layer of
graphite he will be forced to stay inside
the enclosure

  but suppose one of these flatlanders
-presumably more intelligent than the
rest-discovers the existence of a third
dimension and constructs a device by
means of which he can lift himself for a
fraction of a centimeter away from his
two dimensional world if he did this in
the presence of another flatlander he
would seem to disappear miraculously
then he could easily step over the walls
of his graphite prison and could enter
any building in flatland without opening
the doors or windows

  substitute for your two dimensional
creature an ordinary man who is able to
move his body into the fourth dimension
and you will have some idea of the possi-
bilities of my hypershoes

  hypershoes i echoed is that the
name of your invention

  its the name of one of them i have
several inventions but they all make use
of the fourth dimension when i entered
your office a few minutes ago i passed
directly from the reception room to the
center of this office thats why you
didnt see me until i made myself visible
to you

  do you mean to say that you went
through the fourth dimension i ex-
claimed
the four dimensional auto-parker	

precisely with the aid of these
hypershoes which i am now wear-
ing i simply moved into hyperspace for
a fraction of an inch then it was an
easy matter for me to step over the wall
of this room-or through it if you like-
without being seen by you or your
secretary

  an alarming thought flashed into my
brain perhaps the man was crazy he
certainly didnt talk like a rational per-
son neither did that wild glare in his
eyes betoken complete sanity i decided
it was best to humor him on the other
hand i was anxious to get rid of him as
quickly as i could without endangering
myself

  excuse me mr thoroughgood i
said handing him his delapidated straw
hat dont you think its a bit stuffy
in here perhaps a walk in the open air
will do us both good

  much to my surprise he consented

  all right he said maybe that
would be a good idea i have another
invention outside that has even greater
possibilities than my hypershoes i shall
be glad to show it to you but before we
leave this room i wish to make sure you
are convinced that my hypershoes really
can project a person into the fourth
dimension

  ill take your word for it i assured
him

  dont try to deceive me i know you
are skeptical but it wont take me a min-
ute to convince you

  standing on one foot he lifted the
other one and pointed to the bottom of
his shoe i noticed then that the sole was
about half an inch thick three cylindri-
cal holes were cut part way through the
leather two of them under the ball of
the foot and the third in the center of
the heel inside each of these cavities was
a peculiar metal object covered with
small lumps like the surface of a rasp-
berry

  these things are composed of a large
number of three-dimensional spheres
grouped together in such a way that they
extend for an appreciable distance into
the fourth dimension he elucidated in
their present position they are all within
our three dimensional world by means
of a mechanism inside my shoes which i
can operate with my great toe i can push
these knobs out into hyperspace-or
rather i push them against the floor and
the reaction causes my body to be pro-
jected out into the fourth dimension
watch me and ill show you how it
works

then right in front of my eyes in
that brightly illuminated office a
most preposterous thing happened with
amazing rapidity thoroughgoods body
proceeded to shrink it reminded me of
one of those rubber toys shaped like a
grotesque man that can be blown up
like a huge balloon and which when de-
flated decreases rapidly in size while still
retaining its human shape before i had
time to blink my visitor had vanished
completely

  to say that i was astonished is putting
it mildly my face must have betrayed
my amazement for a rasping guffaw bel-
lowed forth from the thin air a few
inches from my ear

  pardon me for seeming to laugh it
roared i cant help it you look so
funny with your eyes popping out and
your mouth wide open

  i shut my mouth and tried to think of
some withering rebuke but before i had
time to utter a word the weird disem-
bodied voice went on to prove to you
that i can do what i said i could i am
going to return to the waiting room by
stepping right through the wall of this
office kindly observe that the door re-
mains closed until i open it and enter
from the other side

  an instant later i heard a piercing


amazing stories

scream which came from the direction of
my secretarys desk in the adjoining
room

  leaping toward the door i reached for
the handle but before i could grasp it
the knob turned and there in the opening
stood socrates thoroughgood in his nat-
ural shape and size

  excuse me for startling you he said
over his shoulder to the girl mr un-
derwood was skeptical so i had to use
drastic means to convince him then he
stepped across the threshold and closed
the door

  well he demanded are you satis-
fied now

  why res i stammered that is-
well-of course it was done by slight of
hand but it was a very clever trick
trick he scowled you think it
was just a trick

   not exactly a trick i tried to hedge
but-

  but fiddlesticks i did it by passing
through the fourth dimension and ill
defy you or any one else to prove other-
wise

  in an effort to appease his anger i
said please pardon me mr thorough-
good your demonstration was so un-
usual that it took me completely by sur-
prise my eyesight is not very good and
i thought perhaps i didnt see correct-
ly it actually looked as if your body
shrank away to nothing

  certainly what you saw was a
series of cross-sections
cross-sections i gasped

  yes three dimensional cross-sec-
tions of my four dimensional body you
can easily understand that if you think
of a two dimensional analogy imag-
ine yourself to be a flatlander swim-
ming on the surface of a quiet pool of
water close to you floats a three di-
mensional sphere with half its volume
below the surface since you can per-
ceive only two dimensions all you can

see of the sphere is a part of a circle-

the cross section of the sphere made by
the surface of the water

vtow suppose the sphere is pushed
 down into the water or lifted out
of it what happens to you it will
look as if the circle you saw first had
become smaller and smaller until it fin-
ally disappeared entirely do you com-
prehend 

  yes i replied that is clear
enough as the ball is lifted out of the
water the cross sections become smaller
and smaller

  precisely and thats exactly what
happened to me a moment ago in real-
ity my body was unchanged but you
could see only that portion of it which
happened to be in your own three dimen-
sional world as i moved into hyper-
space it naturally looked to you as if my
body was shrinking in size

  if thats the ease it ought to be
possible for you to stop the shrinking
process before disappearing entirely i
suggested

  certainly he responded watch
me do it

  i watched

  once more he began to decrease in
size this time more slowly when he
was about an inch tall the shrinking
ceased the tiny moustache moved but
the words that i heard seemed to come
from a point at least five feet above the
floor

  there you are and if you dont
think this is just a cross-section try to
lift me

  i bent over gingerly took hold of the
diminutive shoulders and attempted to
lift the tiny man he seemed to be
fastened to the floor even when i
grasped him with both my hands and
pulled with all my might i could not
budge him

  while i was doing this he began to
the four dimensional auto-parker	

swell out once more until he had re-
sumed his normal size

  there he grinned i guess that
ought to convince you

  it does i agreed im thoroughly
convinced that you can make your body
look smaller and can pass from one room
to another without opening the door be-
tween them nevertheless i fail to see
any commercial value in your inven-
tion

  much to my surprise he took this
criticism quite good naturedly

t must admit that my hypershoes
a are somewhat limited in applica-
tion he concurred but i find them
rather useful nevertheless for in-
stance  suppose i am walking down
the street and i see a creditor approach-
ing me all i have to do is wriggle my
big toes and presto i vanish the
man i wish to avoid thinks he is seeing
things and i am spared an unpleasant in-
terview in the same way i can get rid
of process servers technocrats bridge
players fathers of new babies and other
disagreeable bores

  but i protested most of us are
not so troubled by creditors and pro-
cess servers that we need to use such
drastic means of escaping them there
is only one class of people who would
be willing to buy your hypershoes to
them they would be extremely valuable
it is true but i shouldnt think a
reputable man like yourself would want
to traffic with that type of person
what type of person do you mean
criminals dont you realize what
dangerous weapons your hypersoes
would be if they fell into the hands of
unscrupulous crooks they would be
able to rob homes stores and banks and
to commit any other crimes with im-
punity even if they were apprehended
they could easily escape from any pris-
on in which they were incarcerated

  thats right he admitted funny
i never thought of that angle of
course it wouldnt do to let any criminals
get hold of my hypershoes

  you couldnt very well prevent that
if you advertised and sold them public-
ly i pointed out to him

  all right he agreed suppose we
forget the commercial possibilities of
my hypershoes i have other inven-
tions which are even more significant
one of them in particular has wonder-
ful possibilities for profitable manufac-
ture and sale i have it outside let
us go down and take a look at it

 while we were descending in the
elevator he gave me this preliminary ex-
planation  the most serious problem
in our large cities today is the automo-
mobile parking situation consider a
business man like yourself for instance
each day you drive your car from your
home in hollywood or the wilshire dis-
trict to downtown los angeles when
you get there your automoble becomes
a serious hindrance instead of a help
there isnt a parking lot within three
blocks of your office the nearest one
you can find charges you about fifty
cents per day for taking care of your
car if you wish to call on another
business man say ten blocks away you
first walk three blocks to your car then
drive it five or six blocks and park it
walking a few more blocks to your des-
tination every time you do this it costs
you anywhere from twenty cents up to
fifty cents for parking privileges ill
venture to predict that you spend at
least fifteen dollars per month for park-
ing charges only

  twenty-five dollars per month would
come closer to it i told him

 there you are was his tri-
umphant response you spend
twenty-five dollars per month for park-
ing your car-to say nothing of the an-


amazing stories

noyance and the time lost in walking
hack and forth between parking lots and
office buildings wouldnt you be glad
to buy an attachment for your car which
will enable you to park anywhere-
right outside your office or any other
building-anywhere at any time as long
as you wish and without paying a penny
for parking privileges

  why yes i started to say id
be-

  of course you would he cut in
especially when you could buy such a
device completely installed for only
twenty-three dollars you could pay
for it out of what you now squander
needlessly for parking fees in one
month after that your savings would
all be velvet

  sounds too good to be true i en-
thused how do you expect to accom-
plish a miracle like that

 by this time we had reached the
street floor my office was in the van
nuys building at the corner of seventh
and spring streets with thorough-
good leading the way we walked east on
seventh street and then turned into
spring street

  i came down spring street so it
was more convenient to park on this side
of the building he explained as usual
the spaces adjoining the curb with the
exception of the no-parking sections
were full of cars packed close together
with their bumpers touching fore and
aft

  do -you see those four disks out
there  he said pointing toward the
space between the street car tracks and
the parked automobiles following his
directions i was barely able to dis-
distinguish four objects that looked like
small flat ashtrays turned upside down
they marked the corners of a rectangle
about five feet wide and eight feet long

  when i told him i saw the disks he
declared thats where my car is

parked to prove this amazing asser-
tion he bent over and did something to
the disk which was nearest to us

  better wait for the next traffic sig-
nal  i cautioned him but i was too
late

  just as the bell jingled and the go
semaphore swung up to a horizontal
position a tiny toy automobile ma-
terialized before my astonished eyes it
swelled out rapidly in a fraction of a
second it became a full sized car

  and what a car

  it was a buick roadster of the pre-
war vintage the crumpled fenders
flapped disconsolately the tires were
threadbare the two-man top was
festooned with tattered fabric

  like excited race-horses the double
line of impatient vehicles leapt forward
and charged down upon thoroughgoods
delapidated fliwer the leader hap-
pened to be a big truck heaped high
with gravel it was almost across sev-
enth street when the driver saw the
ancient buick loom up in front of him
his brakes shrieked in agony as he did
his best to stop luckily he had not
gathered much momentum and he was
able to bring his truck to a skidding
stop a split second after he crashed into
the rear of the roadster then the ten-
sion released he gave vent to a torrent
of abuse and profanity that would have
made a mule driver blush with shame

  thoroughgood paid no attention to
him calmly and deliberately he stepped
to the side of his car snapped on the ig-
nition switch and then walked to the
front and proceeded to spin the crank

  after four or five unsuccessful tries
there was a roar from the exhaust and
the car began to tremble like a man with
the ague

  all right mr underwood hop in
he commanded

  in order to escape from the gaping
crowd which had gathered around us i
the four dimensional auto-parker	

thought it best to obey with a noise
like a dog worrying a bone the flivver
got under way

  thoroughgood turned west on eighth
street then headed north on broadway

t nearly always park in loading
a zones or in front of fire plugs he
explained as we clattered over the first
intersection usually there is plenty of
parking space of that sort available but
sometimes even the loading zones are
full then i park directly in the right
of way it isnt quite as satisfactory on
account of the traffic and the dumb driv-
ers but it will do in an emergency
now ill show you how my four-dimen-
sional parker works

  we were about halfway between fifth
and sixth streets when we reached
the mid-block pedestrian crossing which
was marked by metal hexagons sunk
into the paving he swung in close to
the sidewalk and stopped at the place
where the curb was colored a brilliant
red conspicuously lettered in white
paint was the warning no parking at
any time

  i was about to step out when a police
officer came running toward us

  hey you he yelled move on
you cant park there

  heedlessly thoroughgood switched
off the ignition and set the hand brake
by that time the traffic officer had
planted one huge foot on the running
board of the car

didnt you hear me he panted
move on before i give you a ticket
better move on i advised giving
thoroughgood an emphatic nudge with
my elbow

  but he paid no attention-either to
me or to the officer all he did was to
give a few twists to a t-shaped handle
which protruded from the left side of
the steering column

  what happened then was as ludicrous

as it was astonishing looking down i
saw the running board melt away be-
neath the heavily shod foot of the of-
ficer the removal of this prop caught
him off balance and he plunged for-
ward sprawling on his hands and knees
in the road he staggered to his feet
picked up his cap scratched his head
and looked about him with a bewildered
expression on his tanned countenance

  well ill be a dirty name i heard
him mutter guess i must be seeing
things

  his face was so near to me that i
could easily have reached out and
tweaked his nose had i been in a nose-
tweaking mood though i could see
him and hear him very distinctly he
seemed totally oblivious of our presence
so close to him

  thoroughgood leaned over and whis-
pered in my ear we are now in hyper-
space thats why the officer cant see
us all we need to do is wait until he
goes away then we can get out

  for several minutes the policeman re-
mained in our immediate vicinity gazing
up at the sky and peeping underneath
the two automobiles which were parked
near-by finally he abandoned the search
and returned to his post at the inter-
section

  thoroughgood gave the handle a re-
verse twist and the car returned to its
original position

  lets get out now he directed
come around on this side and ill show
you how the parking device works

  standing outside the car he was
easily able to rcach the handle which
stuck out at right angles from the steer-
ing column

  if you will look underneath the car
youll see four rods hanging down from
axles just inside the wheels can you
see them

  i can see two on this side i told
him


amazing stories

 all right those rods are part of a
small but very powerful pneu-
matic jack which is operated by the com-
pressed air in this tank on the running
broad watch what happens to them
when i turn it on

  watching i saw the rods move down-
ward until their disk-shaped feet were
in contact with the pavement then the
rods melted away and the car began
to shrink in size in a few seconds it
had disappeared completely

  there you are he exclaimed
neat isnt it

  very neat i concurred will it
work with a large heavy car

  certainly it will work with any
vehicle-even with a ten-ton truck nat-
urally the supporting rods will have to
be built stronger for a heavier car and
it may be necessary to use a larger air
tank but otherwise the same mechanism
will do for any size car you must bear
in mind that it is only necessary to lift
the car a fraction of a centimeter away
from the three dimensional boundaries
i see would you mind explaining
how you get the car back out of the
fourth dimension

  thats the simplest part of the whole
performance you will notice that in
the center of each of these disks there is
a small milled protuberance about the
size of a quarter any one of them can
be used for lowering the car all i
have to do is to turn one of these tiny
dials that permits the air to escape
and the force of gravitation brings the
car back would you like to try it
following his instructions i turned
the coin-like wheel on one of the disks
there was a hiss of escaping air and
thoroughgoods car grew before my
eyes from a tiny speck to its normal
size

  do you know how to drive a buick 
the inventor asked me

  i used to drive one many years ago

i told him the middle notch is the
neutral isnt it

  thats right suppose you take the
wheel this time turn on the ignition
and ill crank it for you

  little realizing what i was getting
myself into i took my place at the
wheel turned the switch and put my
foot on the clutch pedal thorough-
good cranked and this time the motor
started at the first try with surpris-
ing alacrity he clambered into the seat
beside me without stopping to open the
door

  quick he yelled get going
here comes that cop we fooled a while
ago

  i looked back sure enough there
was our friend the traffic officer he
was coming toward us at a dead run
even at a distance i could see that
there was blood in his eye

  in my haste to escape i put it in re-
verse and jammed on the brake at the
same time the motor coughed a growl-
ing protest at this outrageous treatment
and gave up die ghost by this time the
officer book in hand was asking me for
my operators license

  twist the four dimensional parker
thoroughgood said as he pointed to the
handle which protruded from the steer-
ing column

  he didnt have to tell me twice with
my left hand i twisted the handle and
kept on twisting it until it would twist
no further

  thats enough the inventor yelled
shut it off quick

  but the warning came too late the
car began to shudder and to rock back
and forth at first i thought the motor
had started again but i soon discov-
ered that the motion was quite different
from the vibration of the engine like
a sapling in a heavy wind the buick
swayed and strained then with the
suddenness of a cannon shot the car
the four dimensional auto-parker	

with the two of us in it leaped into the
air

it is useless to attempt an accurate
description of the wild flight which
then ensued moving sideways in an
easterly direction the flivver seemed to
flow along with breath-taking swiftness
following closely the contours of the ob-
structions that lay in our path

  climbing up the face of a building
seemingly only a fraction of an inch
from the wall the flying car swept
across the roofs only to plunge with
sickening speed to the sidewalk below
then across the street it sped hurdling
automobiles and pedestrians who seemed
to be entirely oblivious of our pres-
ence on the opposite side we shot
up and over the next building and so
on until we reached the outskirts of the
city

  soon we were brushing the tops of
the grape vines and the orange trees in
the vineyards and orchards of san ber-
nardino county then as if we were on
a colossal roller-coaster track we were
tearing up and over mountain ridges
coasting at break-neck speed down pre-
cipitous slopes and shooting across pic-
turesque wooded valleys then we
were playing leap-frog with the cactus
and giant joshua trees of the mojave
desert

  as it hurtled along on its preposter-
ous journey our levitated machine went
through the most outrageous maneuvers
it spun and somersaulted and skidded
now moving sideways now upside
down now on end with its radiator
nudging the ground strange to relate
these eccentric gyrations didnt seem to
bother me in the least even when we
were traveling with our wheels pointing
heavenward i had no difficulty in keep-
ing my seat the violent spinning didnt
even make me dizzy

  with hundreds of square miles of

desert land in which to navigate it
seemed rather strange that our flying car
should decide to travel for some dis-
tance along the only railroad in that
section of the country possibly there
was some magnetic attraction between
the rails and the metal of the automo-
bile or maybe it just happened that the
railroad and our own itinerary coin-
cided for a stretch at any rate we
located the rails and followed them for
a considerable distance

  we hadnt been on the right of way
for more than a few seconds when a
west bound transcontinental train loomed
up in the distance rapidly as it ap-
proached us our own speed was many
times faster it looked as if a terrific
head-on collision was inevitable i
started to clamber over the side of the
car but thoroughgood grasped my arm
and held it with a grip of steel

  surely i thought the engineer would
see us and would try to stop the train
before vve reached it but he didnt slow
up or even blow his whistle straight
toward us that great locomotive thun-
dered when it was almost upon us our
car gave a slight upward lift slid deftly
over the cow-catcher and scuttled over
the roof of the locomotive cab as we
shot across the top of the funnel i could
smell the acrid odor of burning oil and
feel the hot breath of the smoke which
puffed through the cracks in the floor
board of the car

defore i had time to draw two
breaths we had swept across the
roofs of the coaches and had sweeped
down upon the empty tracks once more
when we came to a curve in the track
the machine deserted the roadbed and shot
in a straight line across the desert to the
banks of the colorado river down the
west bank we coasted skipping across
the water and zooming up the cliffs on
the opposite shore then away over


amazing stories

the sage-brush wastes of arizona we
scurried

  during this long journey-which had
consumed but a few minutes of time
neither thoroughgood nor i had spoken
a word i was too busy hanging on to
my seat and watching the panorama
which unrolled beneath us with amazing
swiftness to bother about conversation
finally however i managed to gasp
whats going to happen to us

  he shook his head youll find out
soon enough he croaked for the
present theres nothing for us to do but
sit tight

  you can do as you please i panted
but the first good chance i get im
going to bail out

  the chance i was looking for came a
few seconds later as we approached
a city which i afterward learned was
prescott we passed over a stretch of
woodland where the trees were crowded
together so close did we come to the
tree-tops that i almost fancied i could
hear the branches swishing against our
tires climbing out on the running-
board i prepared to hurl myself away
from the car taking a tip from the
method used by railroad men in alighting
from a moving train i faced forward
and leaped in the same direction we were
moving head over heels i plunged
keeping pace with the car which sped
along beside me i managed to straight-
en myself out and to clutch at the
branches which swept past a fraction
of an inch beneadi me i caught hold
several times but the twigs i grasped
either broke off or were wrenched out
of my hands by the force of my own
inertia

  i did succeed in retarding my progress
somewhat however and soon i was
crashing through the branches bounding
from one tree to another bumping into
boughs and clutching madly at every-
thing that came within my reach for-

tunately the grove in which ilanded was
carpcted with thick springy under-
brush like a trained acrobat i landed
with my body curled into a ball and
rolling along the ground except for a
few minor scratches and bruises i was
uninjured

  i walked to prescott which was about
a mile from the place where i had
alighted and went at once to the rail-
way station there i inquired about
the next train for los angeles the
agent who sold me my ticket told me
that i would have to wait for a little
over two hours

  as i entered the pullman car you
can imagine my astonishment when i
saw in the seat across the aisle from me
none other than socrates thorough-
good

  hello there i greeted him so
you decided to bail out too did you
yes when i saw you land i made
up my mind to follow your example
but i had to wait until i hit the woods
east of the city

  what happened to your car i in-
quired

  the last i saw of it the old boat was
still going strong by now it is proba-
bly crossing the atlantic

  by the way mr thoroughgood i
remarked i wish you would tell me
just what happened when i twisted that
dohickey of yours

 t can easily explain that he
a responded you gave it too much
air the jack pushed the car so far
out into hyperspace that it got caught in
the ether drift

  the ether drift i questioned

  yes doubtless you know that not
only the earth but the whole solar sys-
tem is drifting through space at a ter-
rific speed luckily for us at the time
we became detached from the earths
the four dimensional auto-parker	

gravitational field we happened to be at
a spot which was near the front of the
earth as it shot forward the slip
stream pushed us close to the earths
surface instead of away from it as
would have been the case if we had
been on the receding side of the globe

 and suppose we had been on the
receding side of the globe as you call
it what would have happened then

  in that case you and i would now
be frozen stiff and would be drifting
around in space somewhere between

here and the planet mars he replied

  i thank you i grinned if you
dont mind id like to ask you just one
more question now that you have lost
your car does that mean also the loss
of your four dimensional parking de-
vice r

  certainly not i can easily con-
struct another one but you may de-
pend on one thing

  and what is that

  the next one i build is going to be
absolutely fool-proof

a farmers wife and meteorites

  a rather amusing incident or series
of incidents is told of happenings in
the western part of this country a
farmers wife there for some reason or
other took an interest in meteorites of
which there were a number lying about
in the vicinity of their home so she
used to collect them her husband tak-
ing no interest in the matter when she
managed to get an unusually large one on
his wagon he contemptuously threw it
off but presently a collector came
along who was interested in these celes-
tial visitors and he began purchasing
them from the farmers wife and we
are told that the farmer at once changed
his point of view and took a very active
interest in the affair quoting the words

of ralph waldo emerson we may say
that he found gold and gems in these
dull facts and found that a meteorite
was a rock of diamonds just like em-
ersons day of facts all efforts to
find the large meteorite mentioned above
failed so if meteorites come in the
way of any of our readers let them treat
them with a certain degree of respect as
they have a business standing

  one point to be kept in mind is that
meteorites have never been asteroids-
they are a distinct thing when found
on the earth they are meteorites blazing
through the night skies they are meteors
and before they are meteors we may
almost assume them to be nameless-
they seem really to require three names

the fall of lucifer a meteor in milton

                                 from morn

         to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve

         a summers day and with the setting sun
         dropt from the zenith like a falling star

roadside strategy

         by charlie mills

  as old franklin jones came stomping
up the path that led from the
- roadside filling-station to his
comfortable farm cottage he was obvi-
ously and naturally mad before he
reached the cottage his rough voice could
be heard freddy oh freddy where
in tarnation is that no account boy
now ma jones looked up from her
cooking and as she wiped her hands
on her apron said well pa as you
might know he is out in the workshop
fixing that radio for the roger boys he
promised it for them by to-morrow and
another thing-you know he keeps him-
self in spending money by his radio
work ma was always willing and
ready to defend her babys radio
talent

  freddy hearing the rumpus stuck his
tow head out of the workshop door and
asked if it was time to relieve pa at
the filling station and well you know
it is fired back old franklin i dont
see why you couldnt relieve me once on
time for supper im sorry pa
freddy returned as he passed on his
way down the path to the filling station
the old man went on into the house still
grumbling and solemnly assuring ma
that that boy never will amount to two
sticks as long as he fiddles around with
coils and condensers and tubes and them
other radio gadgets but the flames of
his wrath were soon squelched under the
deluge of a supper table covered with
an abundance of mas home cooking

  freddy always ate early and then took
over the station from supper until clos-
ing time when business was slow as
to-night he spent the time with his short-
wave set he heard the police dispatcher

at frameton broadcast a report of a
bank robbery in louisville and advising
cruisers to be on the look out for a
blue limousine with five men carrying
license plates  for the next few
hours he spent the time between cus-
tomers by copying code

  about  p m while freddy was
thinking of closing a blue limousine
pulled up to the tanks freddys first
thought was of the police report earlier
in the evening as a second glance
showed that it contained five men a
well dressed young fellow hopped out of
the drivers seat and called to freddy
fill er up son were in a hurry
freddy went around to the rear and
nearly passed out when he noted the
license number  it didnt help
matters when he also noted through the
rear window a covered object rising
above the mens knees about the right
height so he thought for a tommy
magazine gun

  the stations regular gasoline tank
was empty the filling had to be done
with a can which tommy filled from a
supply inside the station

  freddy took the cap off the gas tank
and to keep up his courage said to the
driver boy shes almost dry i
know that agreed the driver but just
go ahead fill er up and make it
snappy freddy wished this bird would
take his right hand out of that side
coat-pocket but since he didnt there
was nothing else to do but fill er up
and so he did

  before freddy could empty the last
can the driver was wanting to know
how much to which freddy man-
aged to mumble one sixty the
roadside strategy



driver tossed him a five spot told him to
keep the change jumped in and stepped
on the starter freddy paused in the
doorway as he heard the machine cough
sputter then come to life and go roar-
ing down the road toward fernvale
park

  freddy decided to do a little unlicensed
broadcasting he got the police dis-
patcher on and started this is freddy
jones attendant at filling station five
miles south of fernvale park on route
 blue limousine number  just
stopped here for gas and left in the
direction of the park if you are try-
ing to pull a fast one came back the
police operator well make it hot for
you no no freddy assured him
this is straight stuff and youll find em
stalled between here and the park

  the police dispatcher evidently took
freddy at his word for he immediately
started three cruisers in the direction
of the park true to freddys predic-
tion they found five of the fuesetti
gang stalled by the roadside lights out
and ready for action but when the
bluecoats unloaded with riot guns they
considered the odds too great and put
em up it was the work of but a
few minutes to frisk them put on the

bracelets and drive them to the station
house where they were mugged and as-
signed to nice new quarters

  the old chief himself delivered the
reward to freddy patted him on the
back and rather insinuated that nothing
would be said about his being non-
licensed

  it took a snooping reporter to bring
out the facts how did you know he
said to freddy that these birds would
be stalled well freddy explained
you see we keep the pump next to the
high test for tractors and as their tank
was nearly empty i finished filling it
with kerosene the reporter tried to
get more of a story but he couldnt get
in a word for pa jones who kept telling
the world that freddy is the smartest
boy in bennett county yessir knows
more bout radeeo than the feller which
invented it alius did know hed git
sommers goin to give him the work-
shop outright for a broadcastin station

  ma jones could not manage words
but the glances she bestowed as she
patted freddys tow head spoke elo-
quently

  freddy never mentions that he was so
scared that he gave them the kerosene
by mistake

creations doom by dcsiderius papp pub-
  lished by d applrton-century co inc
  new york  pages  translated
  from the german zukunft und ende der
  welt by h j stenning

  mr stenning the translator deserves a great
deal of credit for a perfect translation about
two years ago the reviewer read the german
original and wondered how long it would take
to bring out in english a really worth-while
book and i was agreeably surprised that it
has only taken two years to put a book of
this nature before the reading public

  creations doom is generally speaking a
description of the probable future fate of man
and of the ultimate fate of the planet on which
he lives

  creations doom is written with true pro-
phetic vision based on a strictly scientific basis
in the beginning of the book we read of a
cosmic castrophe-the destruction of a star
which had drifted into a cloud of cosmic dust
became terrifically heated and finally exploded
this cosmic calamity is pictured towards the
finish of the book as the final end of our
earth and of our solar system

  in the first part which consists of four
chapters the author gives a clear and concise
review of the past history of the earth and
the life thereon

  now and again dr papp uses truly marvel-
ous parallels to drive home certain scientific
facts for instance-to reduce to understand-
able terms the age of the earth and the rela-
tive short time in which man has existed he
reduces the computed age of the earth of two
and half billion years into a twenty-four hour
period which assumes that the entire earthly
drama from the dawn of creation to our age
of electricity has been enacted between one
midnight and another in that projection primi-
tive man would not have stepped upon the
worlds stage thirty-four seconds before the
twelfth hour had struck and the duration of
the whole of our proud civilization would have
been accomplished in the sixth part of a single
second the second part of the book is de-
voted to highly fantastic speculations concern-
ing possible physiological and psychological
changes of man and a fairly descriptive pre-
view of inventions to come

  in the closing chapters the author considers
all possible cosmic hazards likely to endanger
the earth-such as volcanic activity astral col-
lisions destructive cosmic rays etc and from
these ominous possibilities we go into the last
chapters describing the cooling of the sun the
extinction of the human species the final com-

ing into power of the insects then the end
of all life and the collapse of the universe
ending with a spectacular explosion of the sun

  creations doom is an exceedingly inter-
esting somewhat disturbing and vastly enter-
taining book

his first million women by george wes-
ton published by farrar and rinehart inc

   pages 

  the theme sudden sterility striking hu-
manity is an old and very much abused one
i have read at least two hundred stories based
on this idea but so far not one of them has
been worth while occasionally however a
publisher apparently not well versed in sci-
entific fiction falls for one of these stories

  the present book has at least some charm
as it is written in a sort of flippantly humor-
ous manner but in my opinion only a balzac
or a rabelais could do justice to this particular
theme

  the story goes something like this all of
a sudden with the approach of a comet all
human reproduction ceases the nations which
always require more and more soldiers are in
despair even very large bonuses for the pro-
duction of babies offered by the various gov-
ernments fail to produce a single child
through the zoometer conveniently invented
in the first chapter an apparatus indicating
virility-one david glendenning is the only
man whose virility registers one hundred his
affair with a pretty girl results in due time in
a baby and the embarrassed father flees to the
canadian wilds he is pursued found and
brought back and then by specially enacted
laws he is married and divorced over and over
again until the disappearance of the comet re-
stores humanity to normalcy and babies

  the book is faintly amusing but the illus-
trations are terribly distressing they are
awful

pirates of venus by edgar rice burroughs

  published by edgar rice burroughs inc

  tarzana california  pages 

  pirates of venus is the fortieth book from
the prolifically productive pen of the inventor

  burroughs first made us mars conscious
but apparently venus will be our stamping
ground for some time to come the book
strictly speaking is a juvenile but will un-
doubtedly be read with enjoyment by un-

whom he rescued from thorist kidnapers in
vepaja he tells kamlot that he loves duare

this is impossible as she is the daughter of

are overcome and the heroine and hero emerge
triumphantly as usual

after worlds collide by edwin balmer and

  philip wylie published by frederick a

  stokes co - th ave new york

   pages 

  this book is a sequel to when worlds col-
lide reviewed in our october  issue like
the first it has been published seriously in one
of our contemporary magazines

  it always seems to me that when the
critics who are extolling the virtues of certain
books and who have to keep a weather eye
open on the advertising space contracts made
by the publisher of such masterpieces comc
across an unusual book like when worlds
collide they are stumped if well read h g
wells is cited and if exceedingly well read they
mention the author olaf staplcdon i enter-
tain serious doubts if any of the standardized
reviewers have the faintest idea of the educa-
tional value of scientific fiction

  well anyhow i like after worlds collide 

  olaf stapterlon wrote last and first man pub-
 lished by jonathan car si harrison smith in 

very much and i am quite sure that most of
our readers will do the same to whet your
appetite i am giving you herewith a brief
survey of the book

  i assume that you have read when worlds
collide and if you have not it is your own
fault the story runs somewhat as follows

  the small crowd of hand picked men and
women who have escaped the destruction of
the earth finally land safely on bronson beta
they have landed on the shore of a great
ocean where under the leadership of the sci-
entist cole hendron they establish a camp
extensive explorations reveal a sweet water
river near by a valley already lush with moss
and grass and a marvelous paved road leading
to a city enclosed by a gigantic dome of trans-
parent metal the explorers find the city as
new and clean as if it had just been built the
water lighting and heating system function
perfectly and the discovery of the portrait of
a woman differing but slightly in appearance
from the rest of real women as well as the
discovery of enormous stores of well preserved
food stuffs strengthen their belief that the long
dead inhabitants of bronson beta were a very
superior race

  they also find automobile-like vehicles also
flying machines the motive secret of which
they finally discover here the authors could
have given quite a thrill to their readers by
the discovery and subsequent reviving of a
vaultfull of bronson betans who had survived
in suspended animation but probably the au-
thors are saving this for another sequel
they also discover ways and means to deciper
the visible and audible records left by the
bronson betans but then serious trouble de-
velops aside from the american ship two
other ships have landed on bronson beta one
from england and one from soviet russia
true to soviet or trotzky principles the so-
viets want to hog it all they already had
captured the english survivors and by settling
in the key city containing the sources of power
they were well on the way to owning the
planet and started war with the american sur-
vivors for absolute ownership of the planet
however through the courage and resource-
fulness of a girl called marian who does a
charlotte corday-the nasty soviets are
overcome and the way is paved for a peaceful
and scientific continuation of the human race
on the bronson beta

  as i pointed out in my review published in
our october  issue i would have labelled
when worlds collide super-excellent and if
after worlds collide had been written as a
first book and not as a sequel i would like-
wise have been compelled to call it not only
good but excellent

  therefore dear readers if you have not
read the sequel in the magaine by all means
get it as a book it is worth the price

some excellent suggestions to be

carried out if-

ediwe amazing stories 

  was the february issue of my favorite
magazine a pip  ask me t go ahead  ask
me and howl its the best issue since-since
-well there never has been a better issue
since i first read a s and incidentally it is
the second anniversary since the first issue i
read i

  it is the best science fiction magazine on
the market i bar none theres no question
in my mind about that the stories are so
refined compared to other rough written stories
of other s f authors

  but what i started out to say was how much
i liked the february issue easily terror
out of space was the best story in the issue
its got the makings of a wonderful narrative
you know what is so good about the story
is that it is drawn out by that i mean the
hero doesnt jump into a space ship the first
thing without any reason or knowledge of
how it comes about-but i must hurry on i
havent much time triplanetary comes next
this story is progressing along finely only
being a reader for two years i am not pre-
pared to say whether it is up to dr smiths
standard or not but i dont know how it
could be much better next i can hardly
choose but-well-i cant think of the name
of the story but it was about time traveling
anyway it was next a close follower was
the regenerative wonder - that was dif-
ferent

  the rest were all good but who ever
heard of an all-complimentary letter so here
goes

  have smooth edges cut out some kinds of
advertisements have more pictures in each
issue-and thats all that is wrong oh i
could add have smooth paper-but what good
would that do-its next to an impossibility
well anyway long live amazing stories

  your critical notes are very good a story
needs to be somewhat prolonged in the telling
the french have a saying that style consti-
tutes the man and it is astonishing how far
style goes in affecting the merit of writing and
narration amazing stories is going on so
well that there is really a chance that the

ing in  i am  years old so i started
reading science fiction at an early age

   enjoyed every issue of your magazine
since i started reading it until you got the idea
that science fiction mags should be printed on
cheap pulp paper and have uneven edges like
a -cent wild west mag i like the new
size but lets have even edges and more pure
unadulterated science but i would not mind
in the least having reprints i would enjoy
reading some of the stories again

  i am very deeply interested in the progress
of science if it is possible to do so i would
like very much to have the mathematical laws
of the inverse square explained in your mag-
azine

  please let us have some more mysterious
covers with pictures of fish dragons etc

  i am glad to see dr smiths triplanetary
although i do not like interplanetary stories
generally but if dr smith or mr campbell
jr writes them i go wild over them

  a good while ago someone wrote radicalite
and a sequel to it i do not remember who
wrote them but they were certainly good

  please pardon any mistakes in spelling and
wording of this letter i have had eleven years
in school and american english i still know
very little about this language

  your letter calls upon us to subtract eight
from venteen which gives nine years as the
age at which you commenced reading amazing
stories there is a well founded belief or
opinion that it is very difficult to write for
children so we feel that very young readers
who enjoy our stories may be taken as giving
true compliments to our authors work

  the law of the inverse square may be under-
stood from a simple example the further you
are from a source of light the less light you
will receive and the intensity of the light re-
ceived at any distance will vary with the in-
verse square of the distance assume a source
of light so small in area as to be virtually a
point call the amount of light received on a
given area at the unit distance o then at the
distance  the light will be in the ratio of the
inverse square of  the square of  is  and
the inverse square is therefore by the
law of the inverse square the same card at
twice the distance will receive one quarter the
light or o-editor

editor amazing stories

  this is my first contribution to the dis-
cussions column of the magazine let me
congratulate you on your fine periodical

  in the main your stories are up to and
above par and what is particularly gratify-
ing perfectly clean and wholesome the
only fault that i can find is with some not
all of the stories you publish having time
travel as a theme some of these it seems
to my mind are overloaded with a great deal
of technical complexities that the average
reader would fail to comprehend as if the
author had allowed his knowledge or should
i say lack of knowledge since little seems
to be known of this branch of science of the
subject to run riot i must admit that a great
deal of it is away over my head and since you
admit that a s exists primarily for the amuse-
ment of readers too much of the sort of thing
i have mentioned only results in my case
anyhow in utter boredom of course i am
only one among your thousands of readers and
my dissatisfaction in this regard may be only
due to ignorance while others may appreciate
such stories as being possessed of a better un-
dertanding of the matter my preference is
for interplanetary stories of which i could
never get a surfeit for like many other would-
be adventurers i like to read of new and
strange worlds and to explore them at least
in spirit i often sit and ponder conjecturing
on the possibilities of life on other planets
and my very limited knowledge of conditions
existing on other worlds and of science in gen-
eral results i suppose in some very fantastic
theories

  i would like to comment on a remark made
by a correspondent in one issue of a s he
objected to stories in which telepathy was
used i disagree since my contention is that
nothing mankind uses is unnatural man uses
what we term artificial light but it is not
unnatural because man is a product of nature
and so are the metals he uses to make the
machinery which produces that light so we
come to the conclusion that the artificial light
he uses is also natural in the same way
telepathy is under a given set of conditions
quite normal and natural and in our present
environment telepathy might be considered ab-
normal but never unnatural man in the course
of evolution may come to a stage where en-
vironment and natural conditions will make
the spoken word insufficient or even impossible
and then he would naturally turn to telepathy
as a substitute for speech such a transition
might require centuries to take place but the
wheels of evolution turn slowly still i am of
the opinion that such a transition is at least a
possibility whereas your correspondent con-
tends that telepathy will never be used being
unnatural

  in conclusion i must tell you that a s is
very difficult to obtain here and although i
have only been reading the magazine for twelve
months or so i have one consolation i can
buy all the back number available from sec

  you say you have little to offer in the
nature of criticism but we find that you have
a good deal we are definitely anxious that
our stories should not be above the heads of
our readers and of course when time travel
becomes a topic we are dealing with some-
thing beyond anybodys comprehension we
have received very few letters suggesting that
our readers are bored by the stories even your
preference for interplanetary stories we some-
times feel is being catered to vigorously we
let your interesting observations on telepathy
speak for themselves-editor

the perfect magazine

editor amazing stories

  every now and then i get a groggy idea into
my head-and now-my idea of a perfect
amazing stories nearly all of my points
have been used before in the magazine but
never simultaneously

  first and essentially the magazine must be
nine by twelve inches with a grade of paper
as was used in the april  issue the
cover would be painted by h w wesso and
with subdued tints such as the october 
cover the title and contents page should
resemble those employed during  but the
editorial should be two or three pages long as
now and not one page as formerly the
inside full-page illustrations should be dene
by morey his best style i think was put
into the drawings for world of the living
dead of course one illustration a month
by wesso would add variety

  in the realm of books should of course
be included mr brandts comments are al-
ways interesting and last but by far not the
least-we should have the present enlarged
discussions and one other thing the old
comet-head title on the cover should be
resorted to

  and now mr editor we have indeed a per-
fect magazine the stories you notice are
already perfect i have been harping about
make-up

  there are many considerations affecting
the make-up of a magazine the opinions of
readers are not greatly devoted to the mere
mechanical details of a magazine the make-up
is of much less importance than what goes
into it there are factors which affect and
which often control absolutely the question of

make-up your suggestions are so interesting
that we are glad to receive them even if we
cannot act upon them at present we thank
you for your good opinion of the stories
which after all are the main thing-editor

did not approve of its appearance the cover
was dull and thin this could be corrected with
brighter colors and better paper the science
answers to the questions were widely spread
why not have them all on one page in the

not appreciate the love in the stories as others

your letter does you great credit--editor

our stories-notes on time travel and
its contradictions

editor amazing stories

  i have been buying your magazine for over
a year and i have finally gotten enough energy
to write you and express some views of mine
the first is about your stories i think that
you have some fine writers who turn out an
excellent group of stories but after considering
them i would like to know if your stories are
scientific or just some adventure stories with a
scientific setting i especially refer to dr
smiths tales i will not deny that they are some
of the most interesting and exciting stories
that i have ever read but the science in them
is used only to produce a thrilling story not
to expound any ideas or to give information
in other words i think that he takes too much
of the science in his stories for granted this
applies to most of the rest of your authors also
i just used dr smith as an outstanding ex-
ample

  i have before me the third installment of
the terror out of space this story is
one of the most plausible stories of science-
fiction that i have ever read the main points
in its favor are that it does not assume that
the earth is victorious in all things or even that
it is better than average it just gives it as is
and leaves all the super-science to another
planet that might very possibly have it this
other planet does not come in and invade the
earth in order to be gallantly defeated by the
hero in the nick of time instead it comes in
much the same way as the white men helped
the indians with the exception that mars is a
good deal more fair finally the hero is not
a super-scientist and does not frustrate all the
enemies plans instead he is a quite human
man who is content to take the back seat when
necessary- altogether it is a thoroughly en-
joyable plausible story that is being enjoed
by yours truly

my last point concerns the much discussed
theory of time travel for some months i have

been trying to formulate a convincing argument
and was much gratified when i found it in one
of the jameson stories incidentally let me say
that i enjoyed them very much i believe
that physical time travel is impossible because
of its absurdity for example supposing
you invent a time machine and go back fifty
years into the past meet your parents when
they were children and kill them then you
would never have been bora you wouldnt have
invented the machine and therefore you wouldnt
have killed them you see how silly it is
now if you went into the future discovered
that a certain man would change the destiny
of the human race went back and killed his
parents before he was bora and thus contra-
dicted the future it would be just as bad
finally if you believe that you can travel imo
the past it certainly follows that you believe
that people who have died are still alive which
is not so

                              chicago 

  we feel that you are perfectly right even
obviously so in what you say about time-travel
but it has given a basis for some very good
stories your letter is so good that it really
needs no comment from us as it tells its own
story very clearly-editor

  peril among the drivers surpasses all of

  all of the march issue was excellent-ex-
cept that poe story  it seems impossible for
science fiction editors to learn that all of
edgars writings can be secured almost any-
where the majority of homes have complete
sets of them so why reprint what nine-tenths
of the world has already read this doesnt
mean that im against reprints far from it
but what is wanted today are rare classics such
as blind spot three lines of old french
face in the abyss people of the pit etc

havent lost by the standing the blind spot
is mentioned a great deal when requesting re-

the diamond lens is one of the most
famous stories in the english language the
author wrote but little recently the diamond
lens with another story of obriens has been
published in a very expensive de luxe edition
we feel also that some of edgar allan poes
stories are very apposite at the present time
when his th anniversary has just been cele-
brated we have all sort of plans for the
future of amazing stories and live in hopes
of carrying them out-editor

a plea for human interest stories

editor amazing stories

  after noting the various complaints in your
discussions columns im just beginning to
realize that most readers after finishing a good
story sit back with a contented sigh-and for-
get to write but just let one notice something
they dislike-and beware for instance one
reader mrs buller expresses a dislike for
mush sex stuff cruelty and supersti-
tion she wrote however with the intention
of keeping these evils out of your stories with
all due apologies to the lady i must say that
mush in the hands of skillful authors can be-
come pathos sex stuff not overdone is
agreeable with me your aim is to please the
majority of readers and i believe most of these
are normal intelligent men you wont find
many men who shudder and throw your maga-
zine aside when the charming heroine enters
as for cruelty-many of poes works might be
termed cruel dont you think apologizing to
mrs buller again my opinion is that young
readers who must be sheltered from such in-
fluences are in the minority we want to be
shocked and the more grisly the better we like
it take away the pathos the cruelty and the
love element and what have you a drab story
in my estimation

  other readers object to such stories as
jeremiah jones alchemist and the good
natured pendulum for my part i liked
them you are quite right mr editor when
you say a little nonsense now and then etc
i might add variety is the spice of life i
certainly enjoy heavy drama but between
killings a little chuckle doesnt go amiss you
editors realize of course that only a small por-
tion of your readers write you but your only
way of judging their likes or dislikes is by the
letters you receive therefore i hereby resolve
to write and tell you when i like a story else
the majority of lazy satisfied readers may be
ruled by the few who like to write

  now for science well i read stories for their
adverture and excitement first or their power
to make me forget everything except the story
itself give me a good plot and an author
who knows how to develop it and im happy
however i like to be reassured that these
strange happenings are not wholly without
rhyme or reason and thats where the science

enters im ashamed to admit that id accept the
most ridiculous explanations for its nearly all
over my head theres no disputing tastes so
if some readers want science let them have it

  before closing id like to disclose my real
reason for writing as you modestly admit you
have excellent authors and i have nothing but
praise for the stories they have written in the
past but for the stories they will write in the
future will you accept a hint from an ardent
admirer of your magazine cant they stretch
their imaginations even more in my opinion
the science fiction writer has an almost-no an
absolutely-unlimited field the wildest dreams
are possible plots very good stories can be
written without an iota of science to back them
up for instance i remember the finger in
the past in the november  issue was
wholly impossible and unscientific but it was
amusing and good reading put in a few short
stories such as this and the two mentioned
above in each issue

  im sorry but ill just have to take time to
applaud my favorite authors and artists here
they are but not in any order at all miles j
breuer dr keller fitz-james o brien cob-
lentz verrill merritt and the favorite artist is
morey and i almost forgot another author
robert arthur jr who wrote theft of the
washington monument of course there are
scores of others but it would take all the dis
cussions columns to name just the good ones
take your bow mr editor

  now ill really close but remember-plenty
of horrors helpless heroines and human in-
terest

                          buchanan ky

  a writer can overdo the topics alluded to
but there is no necessity of excluding them
absolutely the good natured pendulum
which was written a good many years ago in
the last century was in a way a model science-
fiction story based on the period of the oscil-
lation of the pendulum varying as the square
root of its length we have published several
stories with a touch of humor sometimes more
than a touch and for some mysterious reason
our readers did not seem to care for them you
must realize that we get many more letters than
are published in these columns and nothing
would please us better than to give more but
limitations of space forbid this your names of
authors are well selected fitz-james obrien
who fought in the war between the states
died many years ago we feel that his suffer-
ings in the war may have shortened his life--

that i may be privileged to put some of my
thoughts into type

  the two points that satisfy me greatly at
present are your very high grade illustra-
tions imaginative-yes-hut that is what is
wanted morey is without a peer in his field
paul once could lay claim to being the leader
in it but he is completely overshadowed by
moreys talent and your size of the magazine
itsell it was an improvement convenience in
carrying and in reading have been obtained by
the smaller size

  the stories are excellent-you are a great
deal in the fore in your authors and their
production your rivals although quite often
giving good issues have not the consistent high
level you have maintained

almost blush to print it while we encourage
the projection of brick-bats by our correspond-
ents such letters as this are a true comfort-

  a request for amazing reprints-the
    question of artists-an alleged tele-
    scope of hitherto unattained power

editor amazing stories 

  i am going to start out this letter with two
constructive i hope criticisms please dont
mistake them for so-called brickbats

  firstly why not have some honest-to-goodness
amazing reprints i dont know how the
other readers feel about it but these reprints
of poe and verne seem so antiquated and out-
moded that they have absolutely no appeal at all
to me i would suggest that you reprint a
couple of murray leinsters early gems such
as the mad planet or the runaway sky-
scraper also ill bet that the blind spot
by hall and flint would make a big hit at all
events why not give it a try and see what the
reaction to them would be

  lest you think i am a little too hard on
morey i have to admit he did a really fine
job on the cover for february

  i was certainly glad to see philip nowlan
back again on the list of your authors its
been a long time since he wrote anything for
amazing stories hes written some corking
good stories in the past and the time
jumpers was no exception

  heres an item that ought to be of some
interest to your readers a canadian scientist
has recently discovered a new principle on
which to build telescopes it embodies electricity
as the magnifying medium instead of a lens or
mirror the one now under construction will be

as powerful as a  inch reflector would be
it will undoubtedly revolutionize the science of
astronomy

                      rathbun ave
                     white plains n y

  we believe that it will be many years be-
fore poe is antiquated and those who read
vernes works attentively will find that he is
a very wonderful writer we advise you to
reserve judgment on the new telescope until
some definite reports about it are received-

 inquiries and notes on authors-reprints

editor amazing stories

  i am a comparatively recent reader of your
magazine but i have formed a few opinions on
its contents from what i read of the other
readers comments there seems to be quite a
question raised over the subject of reprints
speaking for myself i would like to see some
of the stories reprinted
i cannot see why some readers object so to
the change in size unless it is because they are
filing them away

  what has happened to j w campbell jr
let neil r jones stanton a coblentz bob
olsen and p schuyler miller continue their
good work but why do we have to have edgar
a poe in our magazine we can always find
his work in nearly any library and besides most
of ns have already read his stories i would
like to hear some other readers opinion on
this subject

  since you have joined the n r a why not
raise the price slightly and then maybe we
could have smoother edges  your edges are
however smoother than some other science-
fiction magazines well i hope you keep up
your good work in the realm of science-fiction

as far as we can see the tendency among
magazine publishers is to adhere to their
present prices we feel that amazing stories
is so individual that it is well worth the price
asked for it as far as edgar a poe is con-
cerned you will find something said about him
in answers to other letters-editor

  in your february issue your best story was
the time jumpers what was the idea of
two serials i was counting on bob olsens
peril among the drivers i did not like a
descent into the maelstrom this kind of a
story is out of date one of these stories are
fine every once in a while but to have them
every month is over-doing it you can get these
stories in practically every library and there
are not many readers who would rather have
an obsolete story than one of smiths or

  let me add my voice to the fans that want
smooth edges and the skylark stories in one

pense but i am sure it would get more

reprints questions why oh why must i
be punished so  have been a good and faith-
ful reader i have read each and every issue
except the second number of the first volume
even at the very beginning i hated the num-
ber of reprints jules vernes stories in par-
ticular were an abomination-his fiction i
hopelessly old-fashioned reading his stories
is about as thrilling as reading about a journey
in a ford-written in a tone of awe at the
mechanical marvels of said ford and yet
each issue i dread seeing you announce tri-
umphantly that at last you are going to pub-
lish that masterpiece of science fiction -

	leagues under the sea

  in the last two issues you have two stories
by poe god help us why his stories are
readily available from the tone of the letters
in your column of discussions your readers
are not illiterate it is reasonably certain that
most of your readers have read the works of
so eminent an author as poe the very fact
that they read the type of stories you publish
in your magazine makes this certain i am
speaking from experience one of the first
volumes i selected for my library was a com-
plete poe the few of your readers that
have not yet read poe may easily satisfy their
craving they will find him in any public
library worthy of the name or in their grand-
pas collection of books

  mr editor if you are so certain that your
readers want reprints why not confine them to
special issues containing nothing but reprints
as you did in a recent quarterly why risk

antagonizing your readers who want hew
stories 

  by the way the before-mentioned quarterly
must have been a terrible disappointment to
you in the matter of sales it contained if i
remember correctly i did not buy that issue
of course the second deluge by g p
serviss the menace by dr keller and
yes-believe it or notl-a story by verne may
i be kicked to death by little red ants i
crave your pardon dr smith

  mr editor i admire your courage admire
is too weak a word i hold your courage in
awe but your judgment- the second
deluge is readable but it is below the average
of good science fiction the menace is the
best of the collection but it is not tops in
science fiction i will say no more about verne
-my typewriter is hot already seriously mr
editor did you expect a sane person to dig out
fifty good american pennies for such a medi-
ocre collection if you did what a shock you
got

  by now you think i am a hopeless crank
mr editor i dont care if you do or not but
please i beg you please i pray you think over
what i have written i did not want to write
this letter-i do not enjoy hurting anyone-but
i have been prodded beyond endurance by the
fear that you might be thinking seriously of in-
flicting more reprints on us

  have i no good word for you oh yes i
like the new size why it is more conve-
nient for one thing another reason is that the
rest of the magazines publishing science fic-
tion-including the very respectable blue
book-use the small size at any rate dont
keep skipping from size to size it is very try-
ing to those of your readers-and there are
many if the cqlumn of discussions is a guide-
who bind their magazines i remove a story
i like from the magazine in which it is pub-
lished and bind it with others of its type the
other stories in this group may be from three
or four different magazines need i say more

  i like your apparent present policy of
printing two serials to an issue science fiction
needs length in which to present a strange idea
why because the strange idea must be made
plausible and to make an idea plausible re-

stories is quite to the point as an example

we may cite the popular novel anthony ad-
verse which is about one thousand pages in
length so when we give perhaps a tenth of that
number of pages to a story we need not feel
that it is too long while you do not compli-
ment us we are very glad to publish such a
well thought-out letter as yours-editor

some appreciations of stories-stories written
in the first person objected to

editor amazing stories 

  i have been reading your magazine for a
good while and find it to be great reading ma-
terial and quite educating

  this is my first letter which i hope will ap-
pear in one of the discussions columns

  just got through reading the february issue
and considered the time jumpers by phil
nowlan to be the best lets have more ad-
ventures of cynthia and ted

  terror out of space-this serial comes
next in line-the triplanetary serial comes
next all the others were good

  i think the authors should cut out writing in
the first person-it is monotonous many a
person would have bought a mag but for the
simple reason of finding it crammed with too
many stories of i thiss and i thats etc
whats wrong cant an author write any
other way

  dont mind my kicking as you run the mag
but i think more of your readers would enjoy
the magazine and plenty outsiders who are
skeptical about is who would take to the
magazine instead of leaving it on a rack for
a poorer magazine

  wishing you greater progress in the future
i will stop as t might be taking up too much of
your space

  we think your criticism about the writing
in the first person is incorrect and in many of
our stories it does not appear at all the wish
at the end of your letter is a duplication of
our own we certainly want progress to the
last extreme degree and we venture to hope
that we are progressing-editor

a letter that is so appreciative that it
makes us blush-it is a comfort after
some of its predecessors

  i like the present size of a s and the
january and february numbers are interest-
ing especially the serials it is pleasant in
terror out of space to meet some martians
who are neither angels nor devils nor ruthless
exploiters of an inferior planet it would seem
that professor jeans is of the opinion that
there is no other planet in the universe capable
of supporting men and women similar to our-

would not allow that mars could do so

  i was exceedingly angry when you disbe-
lieved that man would ever reach the moon
it brings to mind beliefs in a speedy end of
the world and its inhabitants and of stories of
flammarion and h g wells where the human
spirit was transferred to a fresh body on an-
other planet also station x you be-
lieve i take it that man as he is to-day will
not be able to live more than four miles above
ea level and a lesser distance below the surface
of course there may be observation stations
etc ten or even one hundred miles up be
that as it may the prospect of reaching the
moon does not now fill me with unmixed pleas-
ure however professor pickerings sectional
maps of the moon are wonderfully clear i
like them better than the excellent ones in g
p serviss story the moon and we can
enjoy these for the time being i did think of
delivering you into the power of the emkls

the picture of the jules verne monument
in nantes franoe

editor amazing stories 

  in reference to mr j harvey haggards
suggestion that you print the illustration of
jules vernes tomb in colors on the cover of
amazing stories to provide a suitable picture
for framing

  i as president of the international scientific
association do hereby place my vote and the
votes of all members to second the motion
enclosed is a sheet containing a partial list of
names it is impossible to gather all individual
signatures so this list will suffice i am author-
ized to do this the number of members totals
 most of them not active at present be-
cause of the depression but all in favor of
the project

  also as chairman of the jules verne prize
club i submit the entire membership of 
names also

  we suggest that the illustration be presented
however not on the cover but as an inner
illustration in color and preferably the best
color work obtainable this would obviate
the titles names etc of the cover plan

you can see but in the future we may make

you for the list of names the distinguished

soon made his home in amiens and died there
in the latter city there is another monument
in his memory-editor

a letter from the philippines from an
appreciative reeder

editor amazing stories 

  have been reading your magazine for many
years and like it very much this is my first
letter to this department though

  i still remember such good stories as death
from the skies the steam god the
prince of liars stone from the green star
last installment of  skylark of space and
many others

  have just finished reading the march issue
and here are my comments

  moreys covers are always good his colors
are not vulgar and he paints pictures in a
striking manner-rather he has an original
touch of his own but somehow i do not like
his inside illustrations the march cover how-
ever done mostly in blue green and yellow
really attracts the eyes what about a cover
depicting a scene in space say a collossal
battle from smiths triplanetery black
yellow red and violet would be vivid colors

  your editorial progress in material econ-
omy in the future was very interesting so
were your former ones

  triplanetary is whizzing onward with
a big bang only edward e smith ph d-
could write such a hit

  peril among the drivers-m-m-m-let me
see   its good somehow but the ant with
a human soul was better i think can mr
olsen write an interplanetary tale have en-
joyed his scientific stories in the past

  terror out of space-fine what became
of the adventurers still waiting for the next
issue

  the man who stopped the earth is a
good short story

  job of blending-fair

  the corona of the sun-good bit of infor-
mation

  m s found in a bottle-no comment
have read it before

  the discussion columns are always inter-
esting as ever i like the readers sometimes-
breezy letters and am also surprised to see
that amazing stories really reaches different
parts of the world

  cant you give us a sequel to cleon of
