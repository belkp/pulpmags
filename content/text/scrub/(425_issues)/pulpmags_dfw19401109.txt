a morton and mcgawey story

 iy donald ban chldsey

morton settled himself in the
stern loosened his revolver in
readiness for a cross-belly
draw placed his immaculately shod feet
together and frowned when the boat
wobbled

  cant you even row

  i can row all right im just not
used to this thing

  the boat was very small while young
mcgarvey was very big and his knees
stuck up so high that he had difficulty
guiding his fists past them but he whs

getting the hang of it presently the
boat slid with speed and no sound
through water on which splashes of light
lay in rows like so many golden jave-
lins

  maybe limpus isnt going to like
this

  maybe he isnt said morton and
sighed deliver me from millionaires
this wouldnt be such a bad town if
it wasnt for them

  wentworth l morton given to
grousing got crabbier and crabbier in

hurricane

 an exceptional
 short novel

the holdup man got in three
shots
sergeant morton was beginning
to feei his arteries    so he tried
to crab a million-buck heisting
act-with a glass of pilsener

his old age but it meant nothing the
truth is he had many good friends
among the millionaires who crowd
miami every winter he was intimate
with any number of czars of industry
captains of finance scions of families
which had given their names to nation-
ally advertised products andhe was
democratic if they were good guys and
bought -their share of beers they were
all right by him he treated them just
as he would treat any other friends
whether fellow cops or bartenders or
arsonists or what it was only when he
was in a notably grumpy mood as he
was tonight that he spluttered about
the harm they did and the work they
gave to the police

  for miami gendarmes suffer from
the sins of all the country each winter
the millionaires come yes in droves
and being millionaires they are wel-
comed but each winter also on the heels
of these millionaires come tinhorn
sports and confidence men horse play-
ers crooked dice artists touts phony
stock salesmen criminal adventurers of
every kind male and female

  few have any connections or associ-
ates in miami a mere hunting ground
for them they do not even splurge the
take locally as a hometown crook might
do they come they plunder and they
scamper away with their spoils-or else
are expelled by an exasperated police

strangers unpredictable unsociable
acquisitive without conscience

  so that from time to time when he
was with old cronies who remembered
the days-when sergeant morton that
bored tired dapper astounding veteran
would moan like this about how nice
his miami-for he always considered it
more or less his personal property-had
been before it was invaded by the
moguls of wealth which was just as
sensible as saying that new york would
be a fine town if you could only get rid
of the skyscrapers

  a little more to the right

  its called starboard

  never mind what its called turn
that way

  the zuleika dobson ii was a bit too
big to snuggle into any of the berths
just then available so she remained at
anchor a short distance out not that
she was large as private yachts go she
was  feet on the water line though
she had a lean overhang which made
her look both longer and faster than
she was she was white sleek natty a
worldly and sophisticated boat super-
cilious even in this hangout of expen-
sive and splendiferous craft

  she belonged to wilkie limpus who
was a character none of your modern
bland quiet faultlessly valeted business-
men of good family about limpus he
was of the old school he was loud-
mouthed he was fat and sloppy he
loved to chew cigars well educated he
affected vulgarity his sense of humor
was admittedly mad he loved to laugh
he laughed when he lost as when he
won for he was an inveterate gambler
-and whats more he called himself
that a gambler and was honest about
it not pretending to be anything else
wall street to him was a green baize
table

  he liked the lights and glitter he en-

joyed applause he was a born showman
and would do anything for a gasp more
than once hed been wiped out but he
had borrowed money somehow from
somewhere and had come back into the
game more boisterous and reckless than
ever the newer nabobs who were em-
phatically well-bred and who attended
a lot of conferences and spoke earnestly
and often especially in public about
ethics-these men preferred not to dis-
cuss wilkie limpus he didnt care

  ok now hold it steady while i -
climb up

  the deck was deserted they crossed
to the main cabin and on the way mor-
ton who was sore enough already
stumbled over a sack of sand or some-
thing--anyway whatever it was it
shouldnt have been there he cursed it
and went on

  they entered the cabin unannounced
excuse the interruption were after
a man with a gun

rphe limpuses were entertaining

  both morton and his young side-
kick knew well the two politicians in
addition morton had on some previous
occasion met limpus himself a fact
which limpus now recalled loudly
come in captain come in
sergeant morton corrected
have you seen a man who-

  my dear this is captain morton
the smartest detective in florida why
hes done more to put this town on the
map than anybody else since carl
fisher lots of the tourists really come
down here just to catch a glimpse of
captain morton

  sergeant morton corrected again
he bobbed his head pleased to meet
you mrs limpus this is my partner
mcgarvey

  the wife of the plunger was small
dark and something to see young me-
hurricane heist



garvey at least gave her a great deal
of attention but ordinarily her famous
husband put her in the shade you sel-
dom looked at anybody else when you
were in the same room with wilkie
limpus

   he was all shirt front and face his
cheeks and chins joggled when he
laughed seated he seemed a big man
but when he rose you saw that his legs
were absurdly short he suggested a
frog standing up moreover he had a
funny way of walking not only did he
waddle for he was preposterously fat
but he always walked as though he were
going downhill and felt the need to dig
his heels in carefully lest he be pitched
forward

  his dinner coat tonight fitted him
abominably his eyes tiny merry light
blue were almost lost from sight in the
great gobs of fat which went to make
up his face what hair he had was yel-
low and lank he needed a shave

  of course you know-uh-mr
blahblah and commissioner-uh-
wahlala the owner laughing slurred
the names morton and behind him
mcgarvey bobbed their heads without
much respect

  and this is my friend mr valen-
tine the art dealer

  pleased to meet you mr valen-
tine the two detectives said politely
and shook hands with a small dark
spiderlike man

  valentined just love to buy my
wifes emeralds for some client of his
been after me for months offering all
sorts of fancy money but of course
he hasnt got a chance

  morton glanced swiftly at mrs
limpus no she was not wearing them
she wore pearls in her ears a short
string of small pearls about her neck
a diamond ring but not emeralds

  the limpus emeralds were as famous

as their owner who in fact was the per-
son who had made them so for they
were not originally a celebrated collec-
tion they had no colorful history not
that they werent good emeralds they
were-the very finest the old inca mine
at muso had ever yielded set in plati-
num and generously besprinkled with
diamonds they flashed in two rings two
bangles a stunning necklace a pair of
tear-drop pendants and a girdle clasp
containing one enormous stone cut en
cabochon

  these emeralds had been assembled
for limpus prosaically in a business-
like manner over a period of several
years there was no sancy among them
not any koh-i-noor matan hope blue
great mogul pitt braganza rio des
velhas none not even the one that
formed the girdle catch and which was
sometimes though erroneously reputed
to be the biggest emerald in the world
had ever been involved in any scene of
violence nor had one ever been owned
by a royal personage stolen from an
idols forehead hidden in a self-inflicted
wound or presented to a courtesan who
had moulded history

  nevertheless they constituted what
was perhaps the most talked-about col-
lection of emeralds in existence always
excepting that which formerly belonged
to the russian imperial family the rea-
son lay in wilkie limpuss ability to
sensationalize everything he touched
he liked to have reporters cluster
around him he loved to see his wifes
picture in the papers and he could have
taught p t barnum tricks in
barnums own game where there were
no stories he made em up and he
made em so vivid that the reporters
whether or not they believed them were
obliged to use them in their stories the
actual handing-over to limpus of the
completed collection and his handing-


detective fiction weekly

over of the final payment check was an
event photographed and described as
copiously as though it were a heavy-
weight championship or the signing of
an epochal international treaty

  about the price itself he had main-
tained and had seen that everybody else
connected with it maintained an elabo-
rate silence guesses soared there were
scoffers who declared that the whole
caboodle couldnt have cost more than
a couple of hundred thousand dollars
but the majority confidently quoted
sums ranging from half a million to
three and a half meanwhile of course
limpus kept his mouth shut while his
wife looked lovely in the pictures and
drew a crowd wherever she went

orton frowned

     i hope you didnt bring them
with you mr limpus

  there they are right over on the
table there ive just been showing them
to-uh-to these gentlemen why  cer-
tainly there arent any crooks in a town
where you work captain

  likely to be crooks anywhere garv
and i walked aboard this yacht easy
enough just now not a soul in sight
you should have been challenged
a forecastle hand named jacksons sup-
posed to be on watch the rest of the
boys are ashore we only arrived this
afternoon and tomorrow we sail for
the west indies so i thought id let
them enjoy themselves

  morton said the point is some-
bodys loose in town somebody whos
pretty careless about the way he yanks
triggers he was sitting in a bar in
south miami avenue just sitting there
alone smoking muggles we know they
were muggles because we got the butts
three of them that is he was prac-
tically through with the third-smoked
em right down to the bitter end too

like a real weeder-and then somebody
passing happened to jog his elbow ab-
solutely an accident the guy snapped
at him and the other guy snapped
back

  ordinarily put in mcgarvey it
would have been a simple barroom
brawl and the bouncerd taken care of
them both

  ordinarily yeah said morton
but our mary warner mans flitting
and he hauls out a roscoe and lets fly
in all directions

  busted a mirror mcgarvey supple-
mented and clipped two innocent by-
standers one of them pretty bad in the
groin

  we got the shells added morton
and our ballistics man says they came
out of a colt  hammerless automatic
he can tell by the mark of the ejector
he relighted his cigar well im com-
ing to the point the guy was seen run-
ning in this direction he was last
spotted not far from here we figure he
must have ducked into one of the boats
in the yacht basin and were going
around trying them all you being not
alongside theres less chance of it being
your boat but naturally we dont want
to overlook any possibility youre cer-
tainly not keeping much of a watch if
you dont mind me saying so

  i see said limpus as for the
watch-as i told you jackson should
be out there he must have gone to
sleep he had picked up the jewel case
as though about to open it but now
thoughtfully he put it down again
well we havent seen or heard any-
thing unusual here what sort of look-
ing man was this

  mcgarvey answered in a voice thick
with disgust

  oh he was tall and short and kind
of medium height at the same time and
he was blond and dark and except for
hurricane heist



the fact that he was clean-shaven he
had a mustache and maybe a beard and
he must have weighed about ninety-five
pounds or maybe one-fifty or two-
eighty he was a middle-aged youngster
who was pretty old and he was thickset
and skinny as a rail you know how it
is eyewitnesses

  i see limpus said again very
slowly his face no longer jounced here
and there it had stiffened and was
bright now with sweat he was staring
at something beyond mcgarvey beyond
morton so what youre really looking
for is-is-

  a man with a colt  automatic
mcgarvey finished

  i see limpus said yet again if
you- if- his voice tightened to a
whisper they could scarcely hear him
but the fear in his eyes was loud my
god look behind you

  mcgarvey spun on his heel morton
turned rapidly but deliberately mrs
limpus gave a thin dry screech which
dribbled off in midair valentine the
art dealer sat erect with wild-staring
eyes and lips that blubbered soundlessly
the politicians were frozen

  in the doorway stood a man there
was a handkerchief tied around his face
there was a colt  hammerless auto-
matic in his hand

   up he said

jyfcgarvey was the fool he was
only a kid after all not half mor-
tons age and he was hot-headed blus-
terous a fighter from the word go he
didnt know how to count costs not
having that much education he had a
talent for sticking his neck out to be
sure it was a very tough neck and could
withstand a lot of hacking but as
morton used to tell him why commit
suicide without stopping to think it over
first

  the holdup man was by this time
probably higher than a kite on his
marijuana and he had already proved
that his gun was no toy morton having
lots of common sense would have let
him go ahead and steal the emeralds or
whatever it was he wanted the time
to catch him was later when that colt
had been safely holstered

  but not mcgarvey

  mcgarvey went for his gun it was
a very big gun an s and w magnum
 revolver with an -inch barrel
it appeared like a beam of light and
almost instantly thundered a long
jagged splinter fell sideways out of the
door jamb and hung at a crazy angle
as though not sure what it was expected
to do next

  tiiq holdup man got in three shots
that ran together almost like one
wilkie limpus sat suddenly on the
floor something clanged against the
brass rim of a porthole where the third
slug went nobody ever learned where
the holdup man went however was
clear to everybody except one of the
politicians who had fainted dead away
the holdup man went backward
through the door

  an instant later as mcgarvey and
morton dashed toward that door they
heard a loud splash

  they went through the door side-
ways one on each side crouching hold-
ing their cocked revolvers high

  the deck was deserted except for a
sailor who came running aft

  what happened who jumped over-
board just now

  mcgarvey snapped you jackson

  yes sir i was forward i-im
afraid i fell asleep

  you saw somebody jump over-
board

  yes sir i woke up hearing shoot-
ing and i was just in time to see this


detective fiction weekly

man back out of the cabin and jump
right over the rail

  whatd he look like -
i didnt see him very well he had
something black over his face and he
was holding something shiny in his
right hand

  while throwing questions mcgar-
vey was not wasting time he scrambled
down into the smallboat unpaintered it
unshipped the oars he kept his revolver
in his lap

  come on mort

  but wentworth l morton looking
at his cigar in disapproval-it was out
again-had wandered into the cabin
deliberate though he was he was the
first to reach the side of the prone
wilkie limpus

  limpus was conscious morton felt
his shoulder

  youre all right must have just
missed the bone well get a doc and
have him give you a shot of tetanus
antitoxin

  limpus fought and found a grin
dont you think ive been shot
enough already tonight 

  morton helped him into a chair then
morton picked up a brass cartridge case
and compared it with one taken from his
pocket

  theyre from the same gat all right
even i can tell that

  he put them into separate pockets
excuse me sir is there anything
i can do 

  jackson an anxious young blond
with brownish freckles all over his face
stood in the doorway morton nodded

  yes go call that wild man whos
rowing that boat around in circles out
there and tell him to fetch a doctor
he- hes looking for the holdup
man sir the man who jumped over-
board

  you tell him to do as i say

ii

lthen the zuleika dobson ii pulled
out of havana harbor morton sat
in a wicker chair and drank beer they
passed breathlessly close to the maleqon
those aboard could make out the color
of the neckties the men in automobiles
there wore it seemed as though they
could even sniff the panetelas these men
smoked

  mcgarvey came along and whammed
into a chair

   hell of a lot of use you were out
doing the town

  morton watched morro castle from
over the top of a stein he put the stein
down wiped foam from his upper lip

   i dont see what you wanted to go
sightseeing for here anyway weve
both been here before

   oh i like to get around

   as a matter of fact i dont see why
you agreed to come on this trip in the
first place

   youve mentioned that already
mcgarvey had he had mentioned it
many times in the forty-eight hours
since theyd left miami he had been
outraged when wilkie limpus immedi-
ately after the attempted holdup pro-
posed to the two detectives that he bor-
row them for this west indian cruise
in order to be sure that the emeralds
were properly guarded brazen publicity
hound mcgarvey had called him try-
ing to cash in on mortons reputation
what did he think mort was anyway
a lousy keyhole peeker ready to do dirty
work for anybody who planked down
a few dollars  a cop so old that he was
reduced to taking a job as practically
a common watchman

  oh yes mcgarvey was indignant
and when he had learned that the
proper civic authorities always glad to
accommodate a wall street power had
hurricane heist



consented to lend the citys star de-
tectives provided of course that limpus
paid properly for their services mc-
garvey only sneered it was still up to
him and morton to give their consent
he pointed out they werent slaves
they couldnt be peddled around like
professional baseball players if they
didnt want to go they didnt have to
go hed do what mort did of course
but he knew his mort-or thought he
did

  morton had always been possessed of
dignity quiet and grave in manner in
appearance he resembled a retired busi-
nessman rather than a sleuth he seldom
hurried and never appeared to do so
he was middle-aged no matter how
amiably you defined that expression
his clothes were always precise and
spotless he was devoted to miami
where he had lived all his life and sel-
dom left the city his vacations when
he consented to take a vacation were
usually those of the motorman

  what was most important he was
despite his deceptively mild appearance
every inch a cop he abhorred private
detectives he was not ashamed of his
profession he was proud of it and he
resented -not infrequently with bitter-
ness that stung the sort of people who
treat investigators as though they were
evils not at all necessary to be swept
aside like door-to-door salesmen

  ill do what mort does of course
but hell refuse dont worry limpus
is just making a show its like he tried
to engage henry ford to be his chauf-
feur mort wont let himself be used for
any sensational stunt like that

  it came as a shock when morton
accepted

  i dont know he said puffing a
cigar im getting kind of tired of
being shot at a change of scenery
might do me good

  but mort this guy with the gun
are we going to sail off on a yacht
while he runs around all reefered up
why not we cant be personally re-
sponsible for every junk hog who gets
hold of a cannon let somebody else
chase him

  mcgarvey looked at him and mc-
garvey shook a heavy head

  thats not like you mort

  maybe im getting old

tte had certainly not done much
work he and mcgarvey had been
shown the emeralds and the safe in
limpuss stateroom where they were
kept and after that until havana was
reached morton seemed to lose all in-
terest in his job mcgarvey at least had
made a show of earning his keep going
over the ship from stem to stern in-
terrogating members of the crew in an
effort to learn something about their
backgrounds and in havana sitting
grimly at the end of the gangplank
scrutinizing everybody who passed

  morton on the other hand had
simply sat on deck drinking beer wilkie
limpus himself sat with the veteran for
hours on end and they talked about
everything under the sun they were
friends from the beginning morton of
course had known many gamblers-
miami is a heaven for gamblers-but
until now he had always thought of
them as what they were harsh stern-
faced men relentless hard-working
tough incalculably patient-men with
eyes of steel mouths of flint hearts of
cold cold stone

  it was difficult to remember that this
bouncy mass of loquacity at his side
this uproarious jellylike clown who
swapped cigars and drank beer with
him smacking his lips loudly was one
of the biggest financial operators in his-
tory this man had gone through more
 

detective fiction weekly

millions than all the professionals who
visited miami put together-and he was
still laughing

  when they got into havana morton
had suddenly come to life he had re-
fused an invitation to drive out to the
casino with the limpuses and valen-
tine he said he wished to amble around
by himself

   but listen mort you cant do that
his partner had spluttered if theres
ever going to be a time when the yacht
needs guarding its now isnt it when
shes in dock

  ok you guard her then morton
had replied walking off

  now they sat watching morro castle
fade into a smoke-hazy horizon mc-
garvey stretched his legs

  you know theres something funny
about this boat after all

  you just learning that

  when we were tied up today and
i was keeping a pretty close eye on the
gangplank along about an hour before
we were to sail captain hudson comes
aboard in a big hurry holding a package
under his arm when he got to the top
of the gangplank he happened to trip
and fall went down hard right smack
on his face well i ran to him and
started to help him up and damned if
he wasnt out cold absolutely cold i
figured he must have banged his fore-
head on the deck but i couldnt see any
sign of a bruise and he doesnt look
like the kind of guy itd be easy to knock
out

  mcgarvey glanced forward to where
captain elias hudson stood spread-
legged next to the wheelhouse-there
was properly speaking no bridge on the
zuleika dobson ii the skipper was a
short man and stocky with enormous
spreading shoulders his hair was gray
but his cheeks were red his blue eyes
clear and hard possibly fifty he could

have whipped most lads of twenty-five

  morton asked what was the mat-
ter with him

   i never did find out heart attack
i sdppose though when he came to he
said he never suffered from them the
only other thing i could figure was that
he must have really fainted i got the
impression when he came to that he
was scared to death there wasnt a
speck of color in his face not even in
his lips and the back of his hands
were covered with sweat the first thing
he did was grab the stuff hed had
wrapped up in the package the pack-
age had got busted when he fell and
some of the stuff had spilled out he
put this back all but a little bit that
he missed and he handled it as if he
was afraid of it his hands actually
trembled then he thanked me and said
no there wasnt anything i could do
said hed lie down a while a touch of
sun he said it probably was

   morton observed the suns hardly
been out all day

  i know

rphey were silent for some time

   harrisson the table and deck ste-
ward came near enough to ascertain
discreetly that morton did not need any
more beer right now then he disap-
peared

   i dont like that guys looks mc-
garvey said sneaky

  smokes marijuana morton said
negligently

   speaking of not liking guys i cant
get as crazy about our host as you seem
to be but i feel sorry for that wife of
his poor kid shes got to put up with
all his clowning shes hardly got any
existence of her own you might say
she s practically crushed under his per-
sonality

   strong words these for mcgarvey
hurricane heist

is

and big morton looked at him side-
ways wondering but all morton said
was what sort of stuff was this i
mean in the package

  kind of reddish brown or brownish
red like drying clay

  you said there was some left on the
deck

  yeah and i saved it he produced
a paper containing a small amount of
what might have been a reddish and
slightly damp dust i dont suppose it
means a thing but i thought you might
want a look

  garv youre going to turn into a
good detective yet some day

  morton sniffed the stuff poked it
with his little finger he deliberately
spilled some on the deck and touched
a lighted match to it

  it burned rapidly with a dull yellow-
ish smoky flame

  well well well

  what is it mort

  dynamite garv me boy a gelatin
dynamite and id say from the way it
burns a mighty fine grade of it

  no wonder the skipper fainted fall-
ing with that stuff

  morton shook his head

  if he didnt know anything about
dynamite he shouldnt be walking
around with a lot of it and if he did
know anything about it hed know itd
withstand a lot bigger shock than that
morton took out a small envelope
and from this he dumped onto his palm
a pinch of what looked like a bright
green powder or very tiny bright green
crystals

  something else i found thats in-
teresting the room steward had all
the stateroom rugs out in the corridor
this morning when everybody was on
deck watching us enter the harbor i
got this stuff out of the rug from valen-
tines room

  what is it

  morton poured the stuff back pocket-
ed the envelope

  pulverized silicate of beryllium
lets go below and take a look at that
safe of limpuss

  limpus is up on deck here

   know thats why i want to go
now

  whats the matter think theres
something wrong

  with you on dut

  listen i sat here all morning and
most of the afternoon while you were
out sousing yourself with pilsener and
i tell you right now that nobody who
didnt belong here so much as put foot
on this boat

  the emeralds are all right down
there then eh

  of course theyre all right

  come along i want to show you
something

jphey went not to limpuss cabin
but to their own which was next
to limpuss the zuleika dobson ii
had been built for cruising in tropical
waters and her staterooms were insu-
lated against heat the outside walls
were not in fact the sides of the ship
there was an air space between the de-
tectives got into that space by taking
a section of the heatproofing material
out of the back of their clothes closet

  take it easy theres not much
room

  there wasnt mcgarvey had all he
could do to squeeze into it

whats the idea anyway mort
now you take that thing down at
your feet morton switched on a flash-
light what do you figure that is
well    some part of the ships
supplies i suppose

  pretty funny bit of ships supplies
a brand new solid copper cable two


detective fiction weekly

inches in diameter and seventeen or
eighteen feet long what would they
ever use that for why would they
keep it here

  i give up why

  i dont know either wish i did
come on

  when they had reached a point be-
tween limpuss stateroom wall and the
plates getting at his wall safe from
behind was ludicrously easy morton
explained that he had noticed this space
when they were shown the safe by
limpus himself

  between them they turned the safe
around in its little house it was a small
square thing new and sturdy but no
bank vault

  i watched limpus when he opened
it for us and i scratched down the
numbers of the combination with my
thumbnail on a card in my pocket it
wasnt as hard as it sounds look-
a moment later he swung open the
door of the safe

  the inside was divided into pigeon-
holes most of them containing papers
and at the bottom was a well in which
reposed the house of the limpus em-
erald set-a large square shallow box
of tooled leather lined with black satin
and black velvet

  so the stones are all right eh
why of course theyre all right
mcgarvey took up the box and opened
it here they are arent they
where

  the jewel case was empty

  mcgarvey was already wedged in so
tight that he could scarcely breathe
now he looked downright sick his face
got greenish he tried several times to
swallow and couldnt over the column
of light from the flash he stared wildly
at his partner

  do you suppose- how can we ever
tell limpus

   lets not tell him at all hell never
know the difference thats what i
real-ly came down here for to put these
back

   morton was fingerhooking things out
of his coat pocket even in that dim place
they glittered and sparkled green stones
and white snuggled into the black vel-
vet they seemed afire there were a
necklace two rings two bangles a pair
of earrings and a girdle clasp consist-
ing of one enormous stone cut en
cabochon

   pretty arent they morton closed
and replaced the case the trinkets being
inside of it now with mcgarveys help
he turned the safe around then direct-
ing the flashlight down he studied again
the thick copper cable at their feet yes
as you say garv theres something
funny about this boat

but what- what in the world-
later lets go up on deck now i
want another beer gives you a real
thirst crawling through places like
this

he drums started at night the third
night after they left havana until
then cap haitien had seemed only an-
other west indian town hot consisting
of corrugated iron and slow-moving
negroes malodorous appallingly dirty
if you looked close you could see a
curious smoldering light in the eyes of
these natives-there seemed to be no
white people in all cap haitien-and a
certain unexpected lift of their chins
but ordinarily you did not look close
it was not until darkness had slid in
from the mountains smearing itself
across the vast plaine du nord and the
distant drums began to pound that you
realized with a start where you were
haiti has always been a turbulent
place and her troubles again and again
since dessalines and petion and the im-
hurricane heist



mortal toussaint louverture himself
defied napoleon in all his might have
started in the north henri christophe
who never had anything to say about
the south ruled the north once as em-
peror leconte got started there with
his boisterous cacos and vilbrun guil-
laume sam and dr bobo the u s
marines found it by far the most diffi-
cult part of the nation to subdue and
today now that the marines are gone
the northern haitian glowers at visi-
tors whether white men or tan whether
they come by ship or over the marme-
lade mountains from port au prince a
city the residents of cap plaitien esteem
effete

  the sooner you get out of cap hai-
tien the better and its just as well
not to hang around at night there have
been many attempts to stuff civilization
willy-nilly down the throats of these
great dark unpleasant men but some-
how civilization always came up again
it isnt wanted it just wont take

  when the drums started the party
was at dinner they looked at one
another scared saying nothing for a
moment it was odd it sort of took
the breath out of them mrs limpuss
hands went by instinct to her neck her
ears the clasp of her girdle for she was
wearing the emeralds her eyes were
bright with fear the others paling
seemed to lose interest in their food

  i always supposed that was tourist
stuff if it was done at all any more
valentine muttered

  limpus tried well they sound far
away anyway

  they did they sounded sometimes
as though they were way back in the
mountains but then again unexpected-
ly mysteriously they would sound very
close just outside of town perhaps
thrum-thrum-thrum    aimless pause-
less then another would answer it

 thrum-thrum-thrum-thrum from very
far off and still another would take up
the talk with the same toneless dogged
persistence thrum-thrum-thrum

  the woman shivered

  gives me the creeps i dont think
this place is altogether safe id be really
worried she added smiling at young
mcgarvey beside her if it wasnt for
our guards

  he swallowed his soup so hastily that
he started to cough

  anyway it was enough to go out
to milot today and ride up to the cita-
del it was very wonderful she con-
ceded but it tired me out i dont think
i want to go to this bomboche tonight
her husband nodded

perhaps its just as well he said
this place must be more primitive than
the interior of africa extraordinary
mcgarvey was looking at mrs lim-
pus morton was looking at mcgarvey

  what is this business tonight
asked morton i missed the citadel
because it was garvs turn to sightsee
but now im all set

  i understand its some sort of voo-
doo ceremony back in the hills the
fellow i talked to today said for us to
stick close to him hes going to hire
three cars for us

  valentine put in but naturally well
keep as quiet as possible and stay on the
outside of the crowd

oh naturally i understand they get
pretty well worked up and im just
as well pleased della isnt coming
theres likely to be some roughhouse
morton napkinned his mouth

  i hope not he muttered im get-
ting tired of roughhouse

  through it all the drums beat on and -
on sending strange messages back and
forth over the miles they talked a
language those in the dining saloon
would never be able to understand


detective fiction weekly

  i see youre wearing the greenery
again tonight my dear limpus said
to his wife in an attempt to change the
conversation youll tempt poor valen-
tine into bidding for it again

  just for the variety she replied

  im sure youll be perfectly safe on
board captain hudsons only leaving
one deckhand and harrisson here whos
waiting on us but of course youll have
mr mcgarvey

  she gave that youngster a full warm
smile

  im sure i couldnt find anybody
better she said

  mcgarvey choked over a fishbone

  and the drums throbbed on

when you got right in among the
drums they were except in ap-
pearance not less terrible certainly
they could never be called picturesque
they were uncarved many were rotten
they were struck by the flat palm not
by sticks most of them were far from
being old tribal instruments passed
down from generation to generation
but on the contrary were obviously im-
provised for this occasion including in
fact not a few ordinary empty keresene
tins nevertheless one and all throbbed
out a rhythm of- menace one and all
kept hideous unfailing time

  even without the drums if it was
impossible to think of it without them
the scene would have been imprisoned
by a pounding pulsation the clearing
was small shadows swooped and leapt
and swung furiously in the light of
torches the negroes glittering with
sweat shrieking stamped the soft earth
beat themselves on the breast fell to the
ground and rolled

  they jumped into the air they tore
their clothes they threw up their arms
from time to time too as it was passed
around they took long draws from a

bottle of clear white rum called clarin
morton tried some of the stuff and for
all the fact that he had a cast-iron
stomach he almost had to let it up
again there is nothing mild about
clarin an acquired taste it is not
recommended for sissies or invalids

  the noise was deafening members
of the party from the yacht when they
wished to speak to one another had to
cup their hands and yell for the most
part they were silent anyway dazzled
and a bit stunned by the strange scene

  the drums yammered unceasingly
men and women six seven eight gen-
erations removed from africa but to
whom that continent was as yesterday
in their more-than-memories screamed
unintelligibly to a lowering sky as they
squirmed and rent their clothes their
shadows black in the red torchlight as
black as the dancers themselves leapt
and split and twisted madly

  they can call it a mystic voodoo
ceremony morton muttered to himself
but as far as im concerned its no
different from any drunken brawl the
other side of the railroad tracks ive
seen it before

  he looked around they were far
back among the shadows not having
dared to venture close to the dance
where their presence might be resented
and it was some time before morton
his eyes sore from the torchlight could
count the others

  the crew of the zuleika dobson ii
consisted of a captain first and second
officers six hands and a bosun a chief
engineer and two assistants and an
ordinary oiler a radio operator a cook
a table steward and a room steward
the last-named being on land limpuss
valet all were here excepting the table
steward harrisson and one of the deck-
hands captain hudson perhaps at the
owners suggestion was mighty liberal
hurricane heist



with his shore leave suspiciously lib-
eral

  morton slipped away in the excite-
ment in the darkness he was not
missed

   a native naked to the waist his eyes
bloodshot staggered up to him he was
drunk alike with religion and clarin
though rather more with the latter than
the former he mumbled something in
creole the degenerate french the hai-
tians speak even a person who knew
french-and morton didnt-would not
have been able to understand this mans
words yet his meaning was clear he
wanted to fight

  morton shook his head and stepped
to one side a fight here might mean
probably would mean a race riot it
might result in the massacre of the en-
tire party stranger things had hap-
pened in these parts these drink-
crazed natives were unpredictable

  however the drunk more nimble
than he had at first appeared side-
stepped also he was again directly in
front of morton

   well im not going to use my fists
morton said quietly because they
might not have an effect fast enough
hold tight sweetheart youre going
bye-bye

  he whipped out his blackjack and
let the man have it across the left side
of the jaw he heard the sound of the
slap even above the uproar in the nearby
clearing but it was a sound instantly
swallowed

  the man swayed he was probably
unconscious even then and about to
collapse morton however felt he could
not take any chances morton hit him
again in the same place the man went
down

  not with a thump morton caught
him under the armpits and eased him
gently to earth

jje straightened looking
around thank god nobody had
witnessed this little scene and if any-
body later stumbled upon the negros
limp form as somebody was almost sure
to do nothing would be thought of it
lhe woods indeed were full of just such
figures morton stumbled over three of
them dead drunk so drunk that they
were gruntless pn his way back to
where the cars had been left

  this was several hundred yards from
the clearing the place was dark except
for the glow of cigarettes where the
three drivers stood

  im going back morton called i
want the last car

  o k

  the drivers were english-speaking
more or less one climbed into the last
car and the beams of headlamps
slashed the darkness in the jungle be-
hind morton red flickers of torchlight
still could be seen a hundred times re-
flected and the thrumming of drums
and the screams of the dancers were as
loud here or seemed as loud as in the
clearing

   morton got into the back seat some-
body got into the front next to the
driver who said over a shoulder my
friend he go back with us o k by
you boss

   well i guess its all right if he
behaves himself

  they slid and slithered and jounced
down to the enery highway corvee-
built under the u s marines but now
scarcely more than a couple of wheel
ruts and turned toward cap haitien
the roan in front pivoted in his seat
morton could not see his face

  you got match boss

  another english speaker morton
not stopping to think fished a pad of
matches from his pocket and reached
forward with them


detective fiction weekly

  instantly his wrist was grabbed and
he was yanked halfway into the front
seat the driver at the same moment
drove the car far over on the right of
the road and snapped off the lights

  morton pulled his head in turtle-
fashion something that might have
been an old-fashioned sandbag jolted
that head carrying away the panama
hat then morton got his gun out and
fired once straight up through the roof
of the car a sedan

  once was enough he was instantly
released and his assailant and the driver
were blabbering for mercy a gun it
would appear was the last thing in the
world they had expected they were
scared stiff

  you may not know it but im get-
ting tired of guys like you get out ill
go back the rest of the way alone

  he did too he left them by the side
of the highway and drove the car
an american car of course into silent
cap haitien

  there was one wan yellow fly-
specked electric bulb backed by a wan
yellow reflector to cast disheartening
light upon the dock the air was heavy
with the odor of molasses four or
five natives were strewn about all snor-
ing nothing moved

  he was not accosted when he went
aboard the yacht indeed he saw
nobody he walked directly to one of
the portholes opening from the main
cabin which was lighted

  mcgarvey six feet three weighing
some two hundred and forty pounds
looked like a huge schoolboy calling on
a girl for the first time there was some-
thing pre-war something tarkington-
ian in his attitude he sat on the edge
of a divan his great hands resting un-
easily on his knees his toes a little
turned in and stared with puppylike
eyes at mrs wilkie limpus from time

to time he nodded he looked too scared
to talk but there was no need for this
since his companion knew how to keep
things going

     treats me as though i was just
some work of art he had bought a pic-
ture or something an ornament he liked
to show off she sighed you under-
stand dont you yes im sure you
do

ghe turned looking right at me gar-
vey who swallowed and nodded
she was very serious very brave a wo-
man who had suffered

  but i mustnt bore you with all this
personal business mr mcgarvey
youre out to have a good time and i
know youre not interested in my poor
little troubles

  mcgarvey managed i-i dont
mind

  no ive been selfish ive been bor-
ing you i wonder if youd be good
enough to reach down that large yellow
book up there and ill show you some-
thing- no not that one the one next
to it- no    no    ah thats the
one thank you

  mcgarvey was all fumbling eager-
ness and while his back was turned to
her mrs limpus was busy morton
seeing what she did smiled grimly her
name he reflected was della but it
ought to have been delilah she took
the book mcgarvey handed down she
turned a page or two tossed it aside
rose walked to the door

  ah no i simply cant be in-
terested 

  she threw open the door and stood
there one shapely arm raised a hand
resting on the jamb her back was to
mcgarvey

  such a beautiful night im glad
theyre not coming right back im glad
we can be alone for a little while
hurricane heist



  morton crouched below the porthole
not three feet from where she stood
she did not look down at him yet she
must have been aware of his presence
he must have been a black lump of
shadow to her

  look at those stars then in a
low voice which reached morton clear-
ly  all right now dont mess it up
this time she turned back into the
cabin leaving the door open

  what-uh- what was it you said
just now asked the samson from
miami

  i was just reciting a snatch of
poetry under my breath the stars
those lovely stars they made me think
of it i adore poetry dont you mr
mcgarvey

  she sat next to him again on the
divan and placed a hand on his arm
she must have been reflecting that he
was almost too easy to be true the sap
his face was brick red he nodded un-
certainly

  yes i-i guess i like poetryall
right

  morton scurried ashore as he went
he took his coat off and twisted his
natty orange tie around back of his
neck on the dock he went to a sleeping
negro scooped up a battered filthy straw
hat left a gourd as he went back he
put his coat on again inside out he
turned up the collar he hid his panama
and slapped the disgraceful straw upon
his head pulled it low

       if only you knew how it was
mr mcgarvey to seem to have every-
thing a woman could want jewels a
yacht all that and yet really be poorer
than the poorest woman in the streets
because-

  morton muttered a word a brief one
that has been in the language since the

 	a haitian piece now stabilized at twenty cents
 tj s

days before the norman conquest he
tied his handkerchief across his face
he drew his revolver he walked into
the cabin

  up

ill

jjcgarveys face at first was a
study in dumfoundment he
looked as though he had been socked
on the head with a pipe never a quick
thinker he was absolutely flabber-
gasted

  then across that face amazement and
rage began to sweep and there were
even for a little while flashes of dis-
belief

  by the time mcgarvey became really
convinced that he was not having a
nightmare morton had almost com-
pleted the job not that this took long
nobody knew better than morton of
miami that the essence of a good hold-
up was speed snatch the stuff and
scram before anybody gets over the
first shock of seeing your gun-thats
the way to do it

  the lady cooperated morton only
had to say put em on the table and
she started to unfasten her pendants
slip off her rings and bangles and other-
wise divest herself of jewels she didnt
scream she didnt blanch morton
never even had to look at her

  that incurable romantic mcgarvey
was getting ready to reach for his gun as
morton saw he was slower to act than
he had been at the previous holdup
then he had not been so astounded by
the appearance of a bandit who was
nervous at best and who had no less
than five men to cover now his mind
yanked back into reality from a dream
which had lulled it half to sleep he
faced a gunman whose hand did not
shake whose voice was cold and low


detective fiction weekly

and who with an awful intensity concen-
trated on him alone an ordinary cop
in these circumstances would get his
hands up and keep them there

  but not mcgarvey

  morton could see that young mc-
garveys mind as soon as it cleared
raced with thoughts of fight his eyes
were measuring distances his ears
weighing the detertnination in that care-
fully disguised voice his heart knew no
fear-morton always said mcgarvey
was too dumb to be scared of anything
-and his strength was if not as the
strength of ten at least as that of two
or three for all his size he could be
lightning fast moreover he wouldnt
topple readily it would take a large
slug striking exactly the right spot to
knock him over

  morton scooped the gauds up in his
left hand started to thrust them into a
coat pocket and then remembered that
he was wearing his coat inside out so
that mcgarvey wouldnt recognize it
so he just held them as he backed to-
ward the door

  mcgarvey was staring over his part-
ners shoulder and mcgarveys eyes
grew very big presently he began to
grin

  o k he said quietly apparently
to somebody in the doorway behind
morton he wont shoot while youve
got him covered

  behind the handkerchief morton
smiled it was so like young mcgarvey
to try an outworn trick like that a
great kid garv but somewhat naive
morton had difficulty keeping the af-
fection out of his voice when he gruffed
anybody leaves this cabin in the next
five minutes gets shot

  it did no good he could fairly feel
mcgarveys muscles grow taut and
when backing he slid ever so slightly
on the corner of a rug he knew that the

youngster was going to let fly at him

  the magnums long barrel sprayed
light as it rose morton with his own
revolver aimed-for the slip on the rug
had not cost him his balance for an
instant-could have shot the thing out
of mcgarveys hand he didnt instead
he sprang backward through the door-
way

  the magnums trigger fell and noth-
ing happened it rose and fell again the
chamber turning dutifully and still
nothing happened

  then the door was slammed

  morton wheeling collided with an-
other man who had handkerchief tied
across his face and a revolver in his
hand

  youre late my friend morton
said lifting the butt of his gun backed
by the heel of his hand to this mans
jaw	

he man went over as though hed
been kicked by a horse morton
scaled the stevedores straw into the
water and when the cabin door burst
open and mcgarvey came streaming
out morton was standing there bare-
headed hands on hips shaking his head
and clucking his tongue

  mort what in the world are you
doing here

  i got kind of tired of the party so
i came away

  the man on the deck stirred and
moaned a little mcgarvey kicked the
revolver out of his hand

  but how in the world- what-
mcgarvey seemed suddenly to remem-
ber his own gun he pointed it over
the rail and pulled the trigger again and
again the hammer rose and fell click-
ing and the chamber turned but there
was no explosion can you beat this
mort just when i need it most i get
a gat stuffed with defectives
hurricane heist



  so thats the way you figure it
look at the gun

  mcgarvey looked and gasped mor-
ton turned to mrs wilkie limpus who
had just stepped out of the cabin

  she didnt want to see you hurt any-
body garv so when you reached down
that book she did a little job of work
on your artillery

  i dont believe it

  no what did happen to the cart-
ridges then he took mrs limpuss
evening bag out of her hand before she
had a chance to protest he opened it
spilled the contents out into his palm
and what do you think these six
things are-lipsticks 

  mcgarvey was silent he did not look
at mrs limpus he turned instead to
the figure on the deck it was better not
to think of personal matters just now
he tore the handkerchief from the
mans face

  jackson

  morton said wearily i could have
told you that long ago i suspected it
from the begining why would a holdup
man even if he was geed up dive over-
board with a fortune in emeralds-
when there was a rowboat right there
for that matter where was his own
boat

  we heard the splash

  sure remember that bag of sand
 stumbled against when we first came
aboard  what was that doing there
where anybody might bump into it the
way i did  and where was it after the
holdup

  but if jackson came-

  he was the quick-triggered mari-
juana fiend all right that wasnt part
of the program he was just ashore
inhaling a few to get up courage to do
the job and he got excited when some-
body jostled him there was a jollyboat
forward that had just been hauled

aboard its bottom was still wet still
dripping

  are you sure of this

  i telephoned headquarters from ha-
vana id left orders to have the yacht
basin dragged especially near where
this boat had been anchored that was
supposed to be to find the gun which
as a matter of fact they did find they
told me over the telephone but i also
instructed them to look for a bag of
sand-and they found that too

  getting jacksons fingerprints
wasnt hard i was sitting on the after-
deck the first day out and jackson was
around and harrison the steward
wasnt so i called to jackson said i
wanted to move my chair because the
sun was getting on me i had two
glasses then-not steins glasses-and
they were nicely wiped and ready he
took one in each hand the way i figured
he would and left a perfect set of prints
i powdered them right there while the
rest of you thought i was just guzzling
pilsener and lifted them off with cellu-
loid foils smeared with paste i took the
foils ashore at havana and put through
a long-distance call to new york police
headquarters

  to arrange a television transfer
would have taken too long of course
i could only give the classification and
describe the different characteristics
and it cant be final until the prints are
actually compared side by side but you
can count it as good as certain that
jackson has done two terms in sing
sing on assault and robbery convictions
yes added morton and lighted a
cigar i was really very busy in
havana

  so thats the way it was mcgarvey
said he knelt beside jackson and began
to go through the sailors pockets
well that explains everything 
does it


detective fiction weekly

  mcgarvey straightened frowning
he stared hard at his partner he knew
morton to be the most secretive man in
the world always keeping his thoughts
and his plans to himself

   no i guess it doesnt at that for
one thing it doesnt explain what youre
doing here with your coat on inside
out

  morton smiled he had forgotten
about the coat

  it also doesnt explain mcgarvey
went on what happened to the rocks
theyre not in jacksons pockets

  oh as to them- morton opened
mrs limpuss evening bag again the
ladys a sleight-of-hand artist you see
mcgarvey did not blink in any
greater bewilderment than mrs wilkie
limpus herself when they saw the
green and white gleam of a necklace
two bangles two rings a pair of ear-
rings and a magnificent one-stone
girdle clasp

  morton handed the bag back

  im going below and catch a little
sleep i need it let me know when the
rest of the gang comes back well have
lots to talk about

iv

jyjorton awoke to the rocking of
the yacht this was not according
to plans which called for a two-day
stay in cap haitien also he saw
through the porthole-haiti was not
even visible-that it was morning he
shook mcgarvey

   whats the idea  i told you to wake
me up last night when the rest of the
crowd got back

  me garvey yawned

   i was going to but you were sleep-
ing so soundly and mr limpus him-
self said not to wake you

  limpus said that eh

  yeah he said the investigation
could be held just the same today
whats the matter mcgarvey getting
fully awake sat up in alarm i do any-
thing wrong

  i dont know--yet

  he went above wilkie limpus in a
pair of green gabardine slacks a red
silk polo shirt tennis sneaks and a
yacht cap was on the afterdeck he
was all geniality

  hi had some doins last night i
hear 

  sort of morton sat down nasty
sea were running

  oh i guess itll quiet down
suppose i could have coffee and rolls
up here i dont feel like going inside
and also i want to talk with you
sure thing harrisson fetch cap-
tain morton some breakfast

  sergeant said morton why did
we pull out last night

  some of the natives got nasty they
said youd been seen smacking down a
dancer it would have been all right
if wed just taken it easy but valentine
had to lose his head and pull agun
oh said morton so hes got a
gun too

  limpus sat down looking at him
sideways

  what do you mean too

  was there any real trouble

  well no but we were pretty close
to it guns are prohibited in this repub-
lic and it looked as if a flock of cops
might swarm aboard this morning so
i cleared out right way thought it was
better

  morton grunted

  and now were heading for jamaica
i suppose

  now were heading for jamaica we
ought to pick up navassa island in a
little while now as to that man jack-
son-
hurricane heist



  captain hudson came along walking
bowlegged head down muttering some-
thing to himself and limpus broke off
to accost him

  everything goes well captain

   i dont exactly like it he looked at
morton as though morton was respon-
sible radio last night had a warning
of a tropical disturbance-not a hurri-
cane just a disturbance-but that
ought to have passed to the north of us
long ago

  shes blowing from the northeast
isnt she

  north-northeast and shes blowing
ten on the beaufort scale which is a
lot and whats more the glass dropped
from  to  in the past half
hour i dont like it

  he walked on shaking his head brac-
ing himself instinctively against the roll
of the boat

  about jackson-

  mcgarvey lumped along the deck and
fell into a chair

  say i call this a real gale just
passed valentines room and he was
in there swearing a blue streak and
turning everything upside down look-
ing for something he must have-

jjis words were cut short by a sea
which caught zuleika dobsons
starboard bow full and fair with terrific
force the boat shuddered the air was
suddenly filled with spray it was as
though an overcharge of flashlight
powder had been set off in a small
room afterwards their faces tingled
their eyes stung and rivulets raced
crazily across the deck striving to find a
way to the scuppers

  lets go up to the wheelhouse
limpus shouted we can get air there
and still be protected get harrisson to
bring your coffee

  im through with it anyway i want

beer now this is no time for coffee
harrisson bring captain morton
a stein of beer

   in the wheelhouse facing a screen of
thick glass they could hear one another
without shouting a sailor was at the
wheel which being electrically powered
turned as lightly as though the zuleika
dobson ii were a canoe the second
officer looking worried was on watch
presently captain hudson joined him
and they talked together in low voices
now getting back to jackson-
you know all about jackson mor-
ton said why ask me about him you
knew his prison record when you hired
him in fact thats why you hired him
he took a drink of beer and made a
face damn warm this stuff he
drank a little more i assume captain
hudsons in on the thing too hed
have to be and probably most of the
others

  say listen here-

  this time it was valentine who made
the interruption he ran forward along
the deck lurching from side to side so
excited that he failed to care when he
was slammed against the deck house

  somebodys been in my cabin
somebodys stolen something i-i
want to talk to you alone limpus
doesnt make any difference mor-
ton drawled i know what it is youre
missing anyway

  oh you do do you 

   sure its the emeralds you bought
them from mr limpus but he didnt
want it known that he was reduced to
selling them and also he wanted to gyp
the insurance company so he staged a
phony holdup in fact he staged two of
them and neither worked meanwhile
you got the emeralds anyway as agreed
only you havent got them because-
morton drew a mass of brilliants from
his pocket--ve got them right here 


detective fiction weekly

  even for mcgarvey accustomed as
he was to see his partner perform
miracles this was too much

  why i saw them locked in mr
limpuss safe last night after youd
gone to bed

jyjorton shook his head

       you saw the dummies i took 
them ashore in havana-i was really
busy as hell in havana--and had them
examined by an expert and he told me
they were peridots from zebriget what
they sometimes call evening emeralds
except that these were the finest the ex-
pert had ever seen they were less olive
than most peridots and more grassy
green like real emeralds he showed me
how you could tell the difference you
squint through the table facet and you
can see what looks like two images of
each edge between the back facets

  thats because of the strong double
refraction peridots have and it was
white gold they were mounted on he
said not platinum like in the real set
and those were white zircons not
diamonds but what ive got here now is
the real thing notice how this big clasp
is different that was too distinctive
valentine wouldnt dare sell that to his
client after the theft of the limpus
emeralds had been reported

  so he was changing the cutting
doing it himself right here on board
didnt you hear those funny zirring
sounds coming from his stateroom
sometimes when you passed garv he
has the apparatus right there the dop
and tongs and skeep and so forth and
he was disguising this stone by chang-
ing it from a cabochon to an american
brilliant cut it would decrease the
weight but it would make the thing
salable which was all valentine cared
about i beat some of the emerald dust
out of his rug the other day thats

what set me on the track of that
valentine probably wasnt his real
name at least not his original one he
was a little man dark taut fierce in
everything he did he was of some
vague south european stock and had
an unreliable temper now he flared
leaning forward

  you give me those jewels back
  morton pocketed them

  i may need them as evidence
theyre mine now i paid for them
what limpus wants to do about cheat-
ing the insurance company is his own
business i consented to back up a rob-
bery story because those were the only
conditions under which hed sell

  it was an ambitious thought getting
the two most famous cops south of the
mason-dixon line to come along on this
cruise morton drawled it would go
over big afterward when he wanted to
collect he turned to his friend lim-
pus how much is this insurance by
the way

  three hundred thousand limpus
replied thats no chicken feed but in
my position i have to treat it as if it
was if i seemed to take three hundred
thousand very seriously a lot of guys
would begin to wonder about my credit
-and that would be bad very bad
you give me those jewels i dont
care about limpus i paid for them and
theyre mine give them to me
morton asked sweetly would you
care to come and get them

valentine reached for a hip
pocket he was not very adroit
morton comfortably seated moved only
one leg he did not even put down his
beer with the heel of a heavy shoe he
kicked one of valentines shinbones-
and valentine forgetting all about
hurricane heist



what was-in his pocket doubled up with
pain mcgarvey sprang behind him
fastened his arms with one huge arm
took the pistol away

  whatll i do with him mort
take him down to his stateroom
and lock him up for a while i want to
talk to mr limpus and i dont want
to be disturbed

  so they sat there alone-or practi-
cally alone since the sailor and the cap-
tain and second officer were too busy
to pay them any attention---and they
talked about things understanding one
another these two middle-aged men
they got along well together

  i could pretty well guess that some-
thing was up when i saw those two
cheap politicians that first night they
werent guys youd invite aboard ordi-
narily you wanted witnesses for some-
thing and i got to wondering what
then the stickup it wasnt-hard to see
that that was a phony but i still didnt
really get the point and i had no
evidence to arrest anybody so when
you suggested that garv and i come
along on the cruise i accepted

  limpus smiled ruefully and even gave
a little laugh

  i wish you hadnt not that i havent
enjoyed your company captain-i
mean sergeant

  im glad youre getting that straight
at last

  zuleika dobson ii was pointed right
into the blow and she didnt like it
she was rearing and tossing frantically
spray slashed the glass barrier the air
was filled with it now and then a sea
came over and went sloshing its boister-
ous way aft

  keep her on her course you fool
cant seem to sir shes handling
loosern hell

  hudson pounced on a speaking tube
and yelled for power demanding to

know what was the matter with them
down there he cocked his head and
cried you havent any lights eh
thats a great big shame youd better
find some juice for us here because if
we cant steer this vessel youre never
going to have any lights again
limpus chuckled

  truth is i never dreamt youd
accept

  neither did anybody else

  i just wanted to get it on the record
that id given the invitation but you
fooled me youve been fooling me ever
since how you can get so much work
done while all you ever seem to do is
sit drinking beer-

  speaking of beer- said morton
why not ill have one with you
harrisson

  the steward somehow reached them
nodded staggered away

  a hundred to fifty he doesnt get
back with it

  im not a betting man morton
said

  a little later he said thoughtfully
hell if this is what they only call a
disturbance i wonder what a real hurri-
cane is like 

rpie sea as they occasionally
glimpsed it was not the sea they
knew it was a welter of mountains
gone mad black mountains rushing this
way and that swallowing their own
foam it carried rage but not senseless
blind rage it carried malice too its was
a killing fury

  here you are sir afraid i spilled
a little

  wilkie limpus threw back his head
and laughed and his face and neck and
all his chins wobbled in delight

  so you made it eh good boy
harrisson this is going to taste swell
looking at you morton


detective fiction weekly

  mud in your eye

  each swallowed bracing himself
then each turned to stare balefully at
the steward

   im sorry sir harrisson said i
know its warm but so is everything
else something seems to be wrong with
the refrigerator

  morton lifted his chin made an o
of his mouth and very carefully put his
stein on the table from where a roll
of the ship lifted it neatly beer and all
into wilkie limpuss lap morton didnt
apologize didnt even notice he rose

  so thats the way it is now i get
the idea

   he raced aft reeling and dived down
the midships stairway

  limpus handed a half-empty stein to
the steward hold this for me please
harrisson ill be right back

  then he too was gone

  morton collided with mcgarvey in
the companionway the giant had just
finishing locking valentine in his cabin
whats up

  morton dashed past him into the
stateroom they shared he picked up a
flashlight went to the clothes closet
took out a section of the heatproofing
material in back he thrust his head and
the torch through this hole

   just like i thought its gone
   whats gone

garv youve been around the tub
what kind of batteries does she carry 
batteries why a special yachting
battery ten of them twelve volters
they mounted on a rack 

  yes naturally extend the beam of
the boat

  um-m thats about eighteen feet
isnt it

  eighteen or nineteen yeah why
take me to them and make it
fast

  however when they pelted into the

battery room it was to find wilkie lim-
pus screwing shut a porthole he was
having a hard time of it what with the
battering seas morton and mcgarvey
helped him then morton remarked
glumly that he supposed they were too
late

  its overboard by this time eh
captain-i mean sergeant-youre
positively uncanny

  id seen the thing and wondered
what it was meant for i got the idea
only now he examined the batteries
yeah clamped down over every one
of them eh not such a hard job at
that

  mcgarvey cried will somebody
please tell me what all this is about

orton gloomily reached up and
yanked the chain dangling from an
electric light there was no response
not even the dullest glow

  that two-inch copper cable remem-
ber  well its at the bottom of the deep
blue sea now but until a few minutes
ago it was stretched across every one
of these batteries for- he turned to
limpus for how long

  almost two hours limpus cheer-
fully answered

  what does that mean mcgarvey
wanted to know

   it means the batteries are thorough-
ly shorted and they cant be charged
again until we reach land-if we ever
do

   there arent any auxiliaries either
limpus put in

  it means growled morton that
we have to drink our beer warm from
now on

   all this fuss about that

   you dont get it said limpus it
also means that the radio wont work
either sending or receiving

   nor the lights
hurricane heist



  nor the windlass nor the range in
the galley nor the refrigerator nor the
connections for electric razors not
added limpus that anybodys likely
to want to shave in this weather
lets go upstairs again suggested
morton

  the wheelhouse was as good a place
as any they could brace themselves in
wicker chairs there out of the way of
the sailors the anemometer was wob-
bling like all-get-out and the shriek of
the wind was such that they could
scarcely even feel the thump of the seas
against poor zuleika dobson ii

  for she had broached to this ex-
quisite lean yacht helpless as a log
she was her twin -horsepower
diesels continued to operate but what
good were they when the steering ap-
paratus didnt work  zuleika dobson ii
tipped to incredible angles-the clina-
meter seldom read less than  often
 or  had she been beamier as
her makers recommended to limpus
she would be better equipped to with-
stand this pounding but limpus had
sacrificed everything to appearance he
had wanted a greyhound yacht and
hed got it

   its a real hurricane captain hud-
son shouted must have turned south
again not the way they should do this
time of the year he seemed resentful
if wed been able to get radio warn-
ings we could have run away from it-
hurricanes travel slow-but its too late
now

  whatre you going to do

  ride it out thats all we can do
but somethings gone wrong with the
batteries-

  i know

       and that knocks the steering ap-
paratus out

  limpus said aside to morton just
like me here its my own boat and i

forget that it steers by electricity of
course i never anticipated a hurricane i
was just going to take it to some place
off an island and sink it in quiet gentle-
manlyfashion

  hudson shouted im rigging the
hand steering apparatus of course but
its never been used before and itll take
some time to get set up another half
hour of this and well be ripped to pieces
if she doesnt steer soon we wont have
a chance in the world

  lifeboats 

  how could you launch lifeboats in
a sea like this

  he staggered back to help the sailors
who were rigging the hand steering
device zuleika dobson ii pounced
upon by wave after savage wave was a
sad helpless thing the very wind
much less the seas was almost enough
to capsize her she seemed indeed to be
riding on her side the anemometer
didnt register anything now it was
outclassed it had never been built to
record a blow like this

  limpus leaned close to morton
shouting i just remembered some-
thing with those batteries shorted the
fans wont work either whatll we ever
do without them

  he threw himself back in his chair
and roared with laughter

  its great to have a sense of humor
morton mumbled

vi

go they sat there limpus and
morton and mcgarvey there was
nothing they could do if she heeled over
completely-well that would be the end
just as well to take it up here on deck
as to hide below and meet death the
way a rat would

  they didnt know where they stood
with this hurricane they didnt know


detective fiction weekly-

whether they were being whirled around
its outer edge whether they might be
thrown off with centrifugal violence to
waters comparatively calm or whether
they were being sucked into the very
vortex the detectives being flori-
dians were not unacquainted with
hurricanes but they did not have ex-
perience with them at sea usually
youre safer at sea usually you can get
your radiod warning and run away
but zuleika dobson ii could not run

  now weve got it captain hudson
shouted now we can steer

   it was his mistake though a natural
one they could not steer he had two
men on the wheel rigged for hand
power but the yacht did not answer her
helm he roared down the speaking
tube to the engine room but there was
no answer there either

   not until the chief engineer and one
of his assistants appeared in the wheel-
house did they realize what had hap-
pened the chief and his assistant wore
lifebelts

  not a chance he shouted me
im going to stick near the rail and be
ready to jump when she goes under
suit yourselves

  no power 

  no nothing its a swimming pool
down there he glared at wilkie lim-
pus it was a swell idea he snarled

  but it didnt work out limpus
agreed

   so they just sat there a lull came
permitting them to talk the core of
the hurricane that false finish that
deceptive center which marks only the
halfway point they sat and wondered
while zuleika dobson ii lolled groggily

  morton looked around for a stein
and found none

  do you suppose harrisson-

   sorry sir but its impossible to get
to the pantry

  mcgarvey lurched to his feet

  id better let valentine out jackson
too no sense leaving them trapped like
that

  morton turned to limpus and said
whats she insured for

  eight hundred thousand

  and three hundred thousand for the
emeralds and added to that whatever
valentine paid you for them not so
much over a million dollars when all
your bribe expenses are counted out
you know id always supposed that a
million dollars didnt mean a thing to
a man like you 

  didnt used to limpus acknowl-
edged things are different now

  i can understand the business of
shorting the batteries if they ever
dropped divers to the wreck it could be
proved that you werent able to send
out an sos and nobody would ever
be able to say how the short happened-
once that copper cables overboard but
the dynamite divers know about
dynamite and they could testify

  i guess you havent got it quite
straight yet morton we were never
going to use the dynamite except in an
emergency no it wasnt going to be
an explosion it was going to be a fire
ive got a lot of thermite hidden below
then wed take to the boats within
sight of land assuming it was calm of
course and the flames would destroy
all evidence

  assuming it was calm

  i certainly made a mess of it
didnt i 

  didnt you

jvfcgarvey came back he flumped
into a chair he had to sit on the
inside of an arm such was the angle
at which the yacht wallowed

  mrs limpus is in the cabin sos
valentine sos practically everybody

else either in it or just outside ready
to duck in if the blow starts again
skipper says we wont stay up much
longer two plates gone were taking
in niagaras every minute

  how bout the pumps

  they work by electricity

  oh

  captain hudson appeared he was
quieter now the ends of his mouth
were drawn down and his eyes were
hard he spoke only to limpus

  whatever your plans are sir im
the captain of this ship and its my duty
to recommend that we abandon her
we can launch the lifeboats right now
pretty soon maybe we wont be able
to navassas still in sight we might
make it but if we stay here whether
it starts again or not we sink

  limpus looked up at him

  go ahead captain im sorry about
this whole business but your record
is clear in actual fact youve done
everything you could do and nobodys
going to know you had any arrange-
ments with me at all he looked at the
detectives these gentlemen im sure
will be decent about it the things not
your fault its mine

  morton said cautiously weve got
to report what we saw and what we
know

  of course but nothing you saw or
know can possibly involve captain
hudson as far as an admiralty court is
concerned 

  no said morton i dont suppose
it can

  all right captain said limpus
  you re coming sir

  you get the boat ready

  hudson left them morton stretched
himself and rose

  well wed better be moving
limpus said merrily im staying
here

  morton looked at mcgarvey and mc-
garvey got up and said sorry but
youre not

  he was strong enough to carry wil-
kie limpus they all knew that

   i dislike the idea of suicide mor-
ton apologized

  you started it said mcgarvey so
youve got to finish it then he added
bitterly if youd only thought of your
wife-

  wilkie limpus started to laugh
there was nothing hysterical about his
laughter it was genuine

  so youre still dreaming of dellas
green eyes and lovely white shoulders
eh

  now listen here-

  hell man dont be silly it was
della did the whole thing bring her
along i couldnt help but bring her
along she bossed the job it was her
idea from the beginning

hphey stared at him he was somber
  now chin on chest

  she wanted to divorce me and she
could she had the goods on me but
naturally she wanted a settlement a
big settlement you should know della
the way i know her well i had noth-
ing to spareim more broke right now
than you two are i really am im
living on sheer credit and have been
for some time how could i give della
anything anywhere near what she
wanted but if i didnt shed bring
suit-and shed win it whats more
shed get a court order to investigate
my affairs and see how much alimony
i was able to pay

  well theyd find out it was just
about nothing but when they found
that out and don t think it wouldnt
be made public-because everything i
do is public-then i would be sunk
once they investigated me good night

della knew that and she simply black-
mailed me if i didnt raise some cash
by a phony jewel robbery and a delib-
erate wreck for insurance both of
which she proposed- then shed start
suit and what would happen to me
shes absolutely merciless that woman
i know shed go through with it

  he sat there not moving the clown
but a look at his face would break your
heart

  well ive done things i shouldnt
have done lots of us have the only
thing is we dont all get caught id
been lucky but this time i wasnt
della wanted a million and this was
the only way i could get it for her so
i tried and i flopped he raised his
head managing a grin so go on you
two im staying here

  mcgarvey swallowed shook his
head said the hell you are

  wilkie limpus rose slowly he was
an old man very abruptly he had be-
come an old man

  they walked aft the yacht rose and
fell in long weary rolls very low in the
water the sea seemed tired exhausted
after all that effort but zuleika dob-
son ii was exhausted too zuleika
dobson ii was sinking the sky was
disagreeably gray though noncommit-
tal the hurricane might come again
but probably it was gone probably
they were free of it anyway they
couldnt stay here

  there were two lifeboats one had
been stove in having been launched too
early while the seas were still running
high in the other sat the entire crew
eighteen men besides valentine and
mrs wilkie limpus this boat was
being pulled away

  mrs limpus sat in the bow an auto-
matic in her hand captain hudson in
the stern cupped his hands to his mouth

  she says weve got to go without

you i cant help myself she says
shell shoot us all if we dont

wilkie limpus slapped his palms
upon his vast belly and threw his
head back and bellowed with laughter
she would too i know her
mcgarvey whispered i simply cant
believe it leaving us here

  you dont know how that woman
can hate

  they were standing not on the deck
which was nearly vertical but on the
rail the sea lapped their ankles
reached for their knees

  theres the jollyboat said practical
morton they forgot it

  limpus jerked to attention

  im glad of that im glad you two
arent stuck but ill stay here im too
old to go through another bankruptcy
especially after-after della i cant
take it any more

  dont be an eskimo all your life
mcgarvey was sore the ships going
down

  and im sticking around lets not
be heroic you boys scram

  another man would have been
abashed but not mcgarvey he shook
his head he faced the plunger

  youre coming

ilkie limpus smiled a little

    he had a foolish face a funny
face all fat and wrinkles he should
have been doing cartwheels in a circus
ring and slapping somebody with a
bladder while kids applauded he
reached for his right hip pocket

  it fooled both of them this time
they werent ready for it they saw the
revolver come into sight they saw the
hammer rise-and they saw that ham-
mer fall the end of the barrel was in
limpuss mouth by the time the hammer
fell the result was damned messy
they stood there a while feeling
hurricane heist



terrible there was nothing to be done
about wilkie limpus the best thing
was to try not to look at him

  come on morton said at last

  in the jollyboat he was crabby
  cant you even row

  i can row all right im just not
used to this-

  mcgarveys legs were very long and
his oar-gripping fists bumped his knees
nevertheless they got closer and closer
to the bare splotch that was navassa

  mcgarvey only stopped rowing long
enough to watch the zuleika dobson ii
go under morton turned to watch this
too the mass seemed to heave itself up-

ward and then it went suddenly out of
sight steaming hissing leaving a sea
peppered with bursting bubbles a few
minutes later everything was calm
there had never been a boat

  it was better to leave him aboard
like that i think that was what he
wanted he was a good guy limpus
was

  he was mcgarvey admitted i
was wrong about him he was a good
guy

this was the moment id lived
for-the pay-off

finger man

ned thompson had his choice between a legacy of hot money  or the
stellar role in a san quentin gas-chamber tableau

the bungalows were of peeling
stucco i went down past the
rusty fountain that didnt work
and knocked on alices door it must
have been slightly off the latch any-
way it went open and charlton was
in there using a screw driver on an
ornamental light fixture on the wall

  alices arm was linked in his and
they both started turning her blue
eyes were wide for a minute the ex-
pression in them had me worried

  hello honey i said uncomfort-
ably

   she introduced him he was her
 uncle she said i felt a lot better i
 hadnt even known she had an uncle
 he was about forty heavy-set with
 lowering brows and a mouth whose
 smile seemed somehow out of order

   he laughed so you two are going
 to get married

    yes said alice smiling posses-
 sively at me sit down ned the
 light here wouldnt work so george
 has been looking into it for me
 just a bad connection he said
 its okay now he gave a screw a
 
finger man



couple of turns and the fixture was in
place

  when alice and i got back from
the movie he was still there playing
solitaire i noticed hed been cheating
himself but i didnt say anything
after that we talked a while and i
told him about how my folks had come
out from the midwest when i was a
kid that my mother the last of my
family had died a couple of years back
that alice and i thought we could get
along on what i made in my present
job which was in slaters garage on
sunset and that we were ready to
make the plunge on the five hundred
dollars id saved i realize now that he
told me practically nothing about him-
self except that he was stopping at a
hotel on seventh

  well get some wine to celebrate
your engagement he said as he and i
left and got in the expensive car at the
curb why dont you drive theres
a funny little knock when it gets up
around fifty and maybe you can tell
me what it is

  his voice was affable brotherly but
his small close-set eyes regarded me
shrewdly

  i sat in the car under the wheel
and listened to the radio while charl-
ton went in the liquor store on the
boulevard my thoughts were on alice
naturally charlton didnt seem the
kind of guy he might have been but
if he was alices uncle he was okay
by me

  the next thing i knew charlton
ame backing out of the liquor store
sort of hunched over and the clerk
ran from inside the store straight at
him with a big paring knife glinting
the little clerk was just crazy i guess
he had a wife and two kids at home
md he wasnt going to stand for being
robbed

  he didnt

  the report was flat final like two
boards spanking together and the little
fellow folded up in his doorway with
his hands clutching at the red open-
ing under his belt he crumpled over
and fell on his face in the glare of light
between the show windows of the
store

  step on it kid charltons voice
crackled as he swung onto the running
board the stubby gun still in his hand
with smoke wisping from its muzzle

  if id obeyed i thought later every-
thing might have turned out all right
but i was numb with shock after all
i was no wise guy i was a young punk
whod never done anything worse than
the kind of petty larceny most kids get
into at one time or another and now
id seen a harmless little coot of a
bald-headed clerk blasted right in front
of me

  murder

  before i could do anything before
i could adjust myself to what had hap-
pened a white-bodied police car came
tearing around the corner its tires
squealing and there were shouts from
across the street and a window went
up somewhere and a woman stuck her
head out and began to scream at the
top of her lungs

  a cop leaned out of the prowl car
with his police positive bulking in his
paw and the revolver bucked and
flamed and charlton ducked behind
our car and into the dark mouth of
the alley at least i think he went in
the alley there wasnt any place else
he could have gone so quick and that
was the last i saw of him would you
believe it well no i guess you
wouldnt but i sat there behind the
steering wheel with my hands stuck
up in plain sight beside my ears until
the cop got to me


detective fiction weekly

jt must have sounded phony at the
police station i can see that now
i told it over and over until i didnt
know what i was saying they didnt
beat me though their bellowed ques-
tions hammered at me until i was blue
in the face but they didnt take any
foot-lengths of rubber hose to me like
you sometimes hear about them doing
whered you steal the car

  i didnt steal it i tell you i thought
it was his the big lamp was beating
down on me

  whered he steal it then

  i dont know wasnt the owners
papers on the steering wheel

  dont give us that stuff thompson
you was his getaway driver wasnt
you

  i put my hands over my eyes and
somebody pulled them away i was
groggy half-blind with helpless fury
by this time listen i said honest
to god he offered to give me a lift
home he seemed like a nice guy i
got in the car and then on the way
we stopped at this liquor store and
thats all i know about it

  they kept yelling at me for hours
i never told them about the guy being
alices uncle they must have found
that out somewhere else

  i guess i could have stood every-
thing a lot better if shed come to see
me in jail but nobody came but benny
nolan and benny cant talk except
on his fingers hes a mute that was
a laugh all right the only visitor i
had and he couldnt talk

  hanging around his newsstand id
picked up a little of the finger language
and the guards let us have pencil and
paper in the visiting room so we were
able to get a few ideas back and forth
he understood why i wasnt blabbing
about charlton being alices uncle but
he told me i was a fool to protect her

he said shed disappeared the day
after i was pinched the cops went
around there and she was gone prob-
ably lammed with charlton maybe she
had a criminal record too shed only
been in town a few months working
as a car-hop at that new place on holly-
wood boulevard

  those dames are all alike benny
told me in his sign language all they
do is wait for a movie break and culti-
vate the wrong people forget her
ned

  no i said out loud benny can
hear all right he can hear more than
any ten other guys he came out here
from new york a few years before my
trouble and he can still spot red-hots
that came from the east side where he
grew up the kind of hooligans that
are now trying to muscle in on the
race track and movie money

  he hired me a lawyer but it was
no use

  i didnt mind the trip up there
were lots of young fellows like me and
the guards let us play cards on the
train after supper it was a funny thing
most of those youngsters claimed they
wasnt guilty-said theyd been framed
i didnt believe half of them but hear-
ing all that taught me to keep my
mouth shut when we got to richmond
we were handcuffed again in sets of
fours and we went through the depot
to a special bus that took us to the
ferryboat then we went across the bay
to san quentin

  i spent two years in san quentin
it took plenty out of me and i guess
it put something in too alice never
wrote the only one who wrote was
benny and whenever i asked him
about her he said shed gone and id
best forget her but dont think i
didnt spend many a night in my cell
wondering about her i guess i still
finger man



believed in her sort of you under-
stand how those things can be my
hate for charlton grew and grew until
it was eating my insides out but still
i kept some sort of faith in alice

  the best news i heard while i was
there was from benny too charlton
had got picked up on another job in
san diego they sent him to folsom
because he was a second offender the
feds wanted him on other charges
but the holdup rap took precedence i
could picture him in prison clothes the
same as me with maybe tougher
screws to bear down on him and slap
some of the oiliness out of his swarthy
puss

  about the most important thing i
learned in san quentin i guess was
this-i learned to hate cops

  youre wrong about that benny
told me talking on his fingers when i
got back to l a but then benny
hadnt done two years

tte had a job for me though and
that was what i wanted i tried
to get a job at my trade but it was no
soap ex-con mechanics werent in de-
mand benny got me a paper route
and a jalopy to do it in and hed even
fixed it up about the drivers license
well it was something a guy like me
has to get his teeth into something
otherwise hed go nuts

  i worked like hell on that paper
route up at three in the morning out
till around eight oclock and then col-
lecting two or three days a week i
had a room over a grocery store not
far from bennys newsstand

  the third day i was back i went
over to the bungalow court where alice
had lived it was only about six blocks
from bennys

  at first the frowsy-headed woman
who lived in the first cottage on the

right as you went in the court and had
charge of rentals seemed to have
trouble remembering who i was talk-
ing about i told her alice pell and
described her and finally the woman
remembered

  that twirp she said well no-
and if you want the truth i hope i
never see her again she skipped out
of here owing a months rent claimed
her uncle was going to pay it but he
never did

  is the bungalow vacant now i
asked

  it was she let me in and i said i
was interested in renting it i wasnt
though not then i just wanted to get
the feel of the place once more luckily
some other people wanted her outside
and she let me stay there a few minutes
alone

  sitting in the wicker chair one of
the same ones that had been there
when i used to call on alice hot tears
came into my eyes and a lump started
pushing up in my throat oh i was
tough now being in stir had put a
coat of iron on me but inside-well
you know how it can be with a man
whos been in love

  maybe shed played me for a sucker
maybe shed only been after the five
hundred dollars but there was the
door to her bedroom and she used
to come out of there looking prettier
than any queen in hollywood and
shed smile at me and wed laugh and
go out for supper and take in a show
afterward and the world was a rosy
apple that we were going to polish and
carry around in our pockets or at
least that was the way she made me
feel

  it was only an accident that i found
what i did im no detective and the
place had probably had dozens of occu-
pants since alice the walls had been


detective fiction weekly

replastered or at least repainted but
in the bedroom was the same wooden
bedstead on the windows were the
same dusty curtains or maybe only
the same kind of curtains and in the
tight little bathroom the cabinet over
the lavatory hadnt even been repainted
as far as i could tell there were rusty
razor blades somebody had left on the
bottom of the cabinet

  i came back to the living room
squeezing my eyes shut trying for ail
impression something i remembered
that was so vague in my mind i
couldnt quite bring it to the surface
and then i opened my eyes and there
it was right in front of me the orna-
mental light fixture on the wall a face
of false bronze holding a little metal
saucer with an imitation candle into
which the bulb fitted

  charlton had been doing something
to it the light here wouldnt work
so george has been looking into it for
me but why had he unscrewed the
fixture  the wires behind a fixture
would be the least likely anywhere
about a room like this to become
shorted no matter how old the installa-
tion was why had he been tampering
with the wires behind the fixture

all it a hunch call it anything
you like but my remembrance of
the last time i was there more than
two years before was so vivid that
hairs were rising along the back of
my neck and suddenly i ha to 
into that light fixture i got out my
pocket knife and used the blunt edge
of a blade to turn the screws and
pulled the fixture away just enough
to see behind it into the hole in the
plaster where the wires ran back into
the lathing

  i didnt tamper with the wiring
after i saw what was hidden there in

the hole i wasnt interested in the
wiring any more my heart was beat-
ing wildly and my hands were sweaty
but i had enough presence of mind
to disturb nothing and to screw the
fixture back in place i went out into
the court

  if i looked like id seen a ghost
the frowsy mrs filomeo didnt com-
ment on it

  twenty-five a month she said or
eight dollars a week-in advance
was that wht mu were getting
two vears ago i asked

  her eyes narrowed and her pale
mouth twisted i was getting more
than that she said i got thirty a
month then you beginning to wonder
how your girl friend paid it

  i felt like hitting her but i nodded
and asked her uncle when it was
paid i mean

  thats right she told me and if
the police hadnt chased them out when
they did i wouldnt have got stuck for
the last month

  i thought they left before the cops
came around

  look buddy the twirp took you
for a ride so what so forget it
you dont have to answer my ques-
tions if you dont want to im curious
thats all i dont give a damn what
became of her

  youre lying she said but ill
tell you about it your girl friend and
her uncle if he was her uncle-she
sneered-beat the cops out of here by
about two minutes they ran out the
back way through that opening in the
fence when the cops stopped to see
me up front i saw em out of the
corner of my eye i ought tove told
the cops but i didnt i hadnt been here
long enough to know what was good
for me

  i gave her eight bucks to be applied
finger man



on the monthly rate if i decided to stay
and moved in that afternoon i told
benny nothing about it

  but he found out a few days later
and wanted to know what i was up
to he found out because i had my
mailing address switched to his news-
stand instead of the bungalow court
and he wanted to know why i stalled
the truth was that i didnt care about
anybody knowing where i lived be-
cause i had decided i was going to kill
a man

  that summer i avoided benny as
much as possible he came to see me
once at the dingy cottage not intrud-
ing just asking if he could help and
letting me know that he wondered
about my paying more than i could
afford for rent but he must have sus-
pected that whatever it was i was up
to  was something nobody could
settle for me that i would never rest
until i settled it myself i didnt feel
guilty when i was around him that
would come later i just felt an un-
easiness whenever he looked up at
me-hes only five four and im
nearly six feet-warning me but not
questioning me and what exchanges
we had grew to be strictly business

   soon i found that i was talking only
with jarnegan the fifteen-year-old kid
who helped benny because the stand
was doing so well then the store
next door was vacated and benny
rented it putting in a line of novelties
and installing a telephone he was ap-
proached i know about adding a little
bookmaking on the horses but he re-
sisted and nobody had the guts to put
pressure on him he had too many
friends in power official and unofficial
by now

   i went to the public library files and
found the newspaper notices about the
holdup in san diego the one where

theyd got charlton-also the mention
a month or so later about his being

sent  folsom frv- five vears well 
thought he may get paroled but then
i remembered that the feds wanted
him too and that theyd probably grab
him on a more serious rap as soon as
he was released

 whats wrong with you mr
thompson jarnegan asked me one
day youre thin as a rail dont you
ever sleep or eat i never seen you
at it

genny s too-wise eyes were watch-
ing what i do is my own busi-
ness i snarled and left but the
boy was telling the truth a fever was
consuming me and it wasnt the kind
of fever a doctor could treat i spent
most of my spare time haunting skid
row around main and fifth and the
hollywood call houses and the long
beach and san pedro joints that were
worse hoping and dreading to find
some trace of alice

  the monstrous fear that she might
be in a latin-american dive forever
beyond my reach was slowly driving
me insane

  when i tried to sleep i only lay
on the bed in cold sweat with ice in
my bones staring through the door-
way through whatever feeble shafts of
light came through the windows at the
false candle on the living-room wall
letting my hate for charlton run
through my body like a sustaining
drug i think i would have waited a
lifetime though god knows my life-
time wouldnt have been much

  but one morning i got up at two-
thirty as usual and when i reached
bennys and saw the headlines on the
papers the truck dumped off a bomb
exploded in my mind and i knew that
i was ready for murder


detective fiction weekly

 you remember the break two
screws were killed and theres still
some mystery as to how the gats were
smuggled in everything had been
going peacefully too long it was like
alcatraz they claimed it was impos-
sible to break out of folsom and as
soon as newspaper articles began play-
ing up how impregnable it was the
break came charlton was one of the
three that got clean away

  you sick mr thompson young
jarnegan asked as he saw me reading
the paper

  yes i said im not working to-
day get somebody to take my route

  he stared after me he knew i was
an ex-con and i guess he thought i
was altogether insane at last i went
by the greeks and got sandwiches and
cartons of coffee and i didnt care if
the coffee got cold i went back to the
bungalow court in the bureau drawer
was a nickeled  revolver that id
paid eight bucks for on skid row

  there was a moon that night so i
turned out all the lights it would soon
be day anyway

  no matter how long it took i
would wait i had murder on my mind
nothing could quench the fires in me
but to kill or be killed and i didnt
aim to be killed

  the dawn came up and found me
sitting on a straight-backed chair just
inside the bathroom with the door
cracked open an inch giving me a line
through the bedroom to the trap on
the living-room wall the cheap gun
was in my hand i never put it down
it wasnt going to have to fire but one
shot the way i figured it and i knew
it was good for that id tested it down
at the beach the night after i bought
it no i didnt mean to shoot him in
the back i meant to get up and go
in and tell him to turn around and see

me and know what was coming and
then shoot him in the face

  that would be the extent of my
warning i wouldnt give him a chance
to go for his own gun if he had one
i wouldnt give him any more chance
than a mad dog

  no doubt exists in me now that i
was what the doctors call a homicidal
maniac the sandwiches and coffee sat
on the tile floor beside me during the
morning while the slantwise window-
pattern of sun appeared on the bed-
room floor and traveled slowly across
a wall and receded i never thought
to eat

  at one oclock by my strapwatch
there was a knock on the outer door
i didnt move the knock came again
a timid tap-tap-tap it sounded like
benny nolan but was it

  the door was not locked if it was
benny he would come in i thought
i waited the knuckling came- once
more furtively now or so i thought
and still i didnt move

jjuring the afternoon i must have
munched on a sandwich and taken
some cold coffee i dont remember it
but afterward part of a sandwich was
found there on the floor beside its oil-
paper wrapping and one of the cartons
of coffee was open and nearly empty
so i must have

  all i remember is sitting motionless
except for occasional wriggling of my
gun hand to keep the trigger finger
limber and listening to the dim noises
from the street and unidentifiable
voices and footsteps that went by with-
out pausing on the cement walk of the
court and inside the ticking of the
alarm clock on the little table by the
bed

  at dusk i thought i might have to
turn on a light somewhere in the
finger man



bungalow but as it grew darker i saw
this wouldnt be necessary enough
pale glow came in the windows so i
could make out the wall trap well
enough and that was all i needed

  it was a little after nine oclock
when he came i was surprised i
thought he would wait until the wee
hours and then come sneaking like the
scavenger he was but his entrance
was so matter-of-fact and abrupt that
it was like in a dream that you know
youre dreaming and that theres
something wrong about it but you
cant wake yourself up

  the footsteps came briskly and the
next sound was that of a key being
inserted in the cylinder lock a key
he must have left it somewhere and
remembered and gone back for it
knowing it was not likely the lock
would have been changed then his
other hand must have been on the
knob because the door came open and
he walked boldly in and stood there
and i still couldnt see him my hand
was rigid on the gun and i felt like
there was a tight band around my
chest

  he couldnt have any way of know-
ing if the place was occupied i told
myself he was taking the chance be-
cause he had to

  ages went by in the ticking of the
clock and there was no further sound
its got to be him i was praying oh
god its got to be him

  it was him he must have satisfied
himself that he was alone because he
walked to the bedroom door and his
eyes were blobs of white in his dark
predatory face as he sniffed as warily
as a hunting cat if he comes toward
the bathroom i thought ill open the
door and let him have it now and he
took three steps toward me

  he turned and in the darkness my

grip relaxed on the knob of the door
id been about to swing open he went
to the living-room wall drawing a
small screw driver from the pocket of
his tweed coat

  i did it exactly as id planned i let
him get the fixture hanging loose on
its wires let him get the greedy hairy
fingers of his right hand on the thick
roll of twenties and then i opened the
bathroom door wide on its oiled hinges
and entered silently in the shadows

  hello charlton

his was the moment id lived for
-the pay-off for which id suf-
fered all the agonies of hell i should
have felt a surge of sadistic animal joy
but in me there was only a cold re-
morseless hatred that would make me
cfty- what needed to be done and after
that i wouldnt care what happened
my whole reason for living would be
gone

  any idea who i am i asked i
wanted him to cringe to get down on
his knees and beg for his life he only
froze with his hand still on the roll of
blood money

  still his head didnt turn i was a
good six feet from him

  the first thing an ex-con needs is
dough we both know that i went
on maybe you better than me with
all the crush-out heat that right
charlton

  his head turned a little then enough
for his ghost-lit eyes to bear on me
and his dark jaw was clamped so hard
there were ugly lines from the corners
of his red mouth

  well punk he said whats the
play

  i fought back the mad impulse to
fire and asked what did you do with
alice

  he laughed a low slaty rasp so

thats whats eating you he let his
hand come out of the hole away from
the money bu kept it up and slowly
raised his left-hand to the same level

  talk you rat talk it couldnt
have been my voice it was too shaky
but the gun in my hand was steady
enough and it was lined between his
eyes and while he watched i cocked
it making a quiet click in the dimness

  take it easy kid he whispered
hoarsely

   either you killed her i said or
you shipped her off somewhere she
must have known about this money
she must have seen you cache it i
dont care where you got it i dont
care who you heisted for it all i
know is that she must have known it
was here and shed probably have been
broke shed have come back for it at
some time she didnt-and you know
why what became of her

  he laughed again shes waiting
outside now he told me

  on the instant of my involuntarv
start he came for my knees in a head-
long plunge i stepped back just far
enough for a good shot at his spine
and as coolly and steadily as if he had
been a moving target in a gallery i
pulled the trigger

  he crashed into me smashing me
backwards and in the midst of falling
i put the muzzle into his face and
frantically pulled the trigger again and
again and still the gun didnt go off
he twisted the useless weapon out of
my hand it skittered out of his grasp
he swung at my face and then his
fingers were gouging at my eyes

  with a strength i never knew i
possessed i twisted and got him off
me with my knees i lashed out fur-
iously one of his legs tripped me we
crashed to the floor together the back
of my head hit first in the flashing

moment when i was stunned he pro-
duced a gun of his own and slashed
with its barrel

  the sight of the automatic ripped
my cheek his left hand was clenching
my shirt and grunting he raised the
gun to slash again thank god he was
afraid to shoot me afraid to make an
alarm if he hadnt been trying to keep
quiet neither of us would have heard
the imperious knocking on the door

         the labored husks of our
breathing fell into the silence then
the knocking was repeated louder

  he let go my shirt and stood up
keeping the automatic trained on me
his leering evil eyes pinned me down

  who the hell could that be he
asked

  -dont-know i said

  where were you when i came in 

  i raised up on an elbow in the
bathroom

  okay he said im going there
now he scooped up the revolver
which had failed me and listen
chump-waggling the big automatic
-stay in range of this always in
sight of me-and it turn on a light
if you want to

   he was taking the roll of bills from
behind the fixture and he lodged it
back in place and stuck in a screw
not bothering to turn it just sticking
it in so the fixture wouldnt fall he
pocketed the roll and backed toward
the bedroom

  the knocking came again i stood
up

  careful he said ill stay here
while you see who it is keep em out
if you can if you cant-if its some-
body you have to let in-watch what
you say and do i killed two guys in
the break and they cant gas me any
more if i have to blast you too
finger man



  while he stood just inside the dark-
ened bedroom i switched on a floor
lamp i started toward the door

  wait a minute

  i stopped i could feel his eyes- in
my back

  if its benny nolan he said keep
your hands still all the time im onto
that gag

  maybe its alice i thought but the
knock wasnt like a womans i went
to the door smoothing my hair and
adjusting my shirt and dabbing blood
from my cut cheek with a handkerchief

  who is it

  no answer i called again still no
answer i opened the door bennys
worried countenance peered up at me

  what do you want i said

  he sidled past me his sharp eyes
probing me and the room i followed
what else could i do i watched his
hands keeping mine hanging limp he
stood near the floor lamp and let his
gaze roam passing over the dark maw
of the bedroom and return to me and
then his fingers moved

  i told the kid i was sick i said
i kept away from the lamp

  his sign language asked me another
question

  its none of your business i said
besides i dont need a doctor all i
need is rest just leave me be and
as he started in again what

  the tension was straining every
nerve in my body charlton hadnt
been bluffing hed kill a dozen men
now before hed be caught for a
fleeting moment the idea struck me
that he might have lammed out a win-
dow with the roll but i couldnt bank
on that possibility

  suppose charlton has escaped
i told benny i dont see why hed
come here hed have no reason hed
probably head for mexico

  bennys hands moved swiftly again
fingers flashing from one position to
another

  all right i said ill be careful
but i think youre screwy theres no
attraction here for him

  he made a shrugging motion then
an outward gesture

  ill go to bed i said if i dont
show up the kid will know what to do
but let me be the judge about whether
i need a doctor

  the door closed behind him charl-
ton came out the automatic bulked
in his fist

  i dont like it he said

  what else could i do i asked
him

  its damned funny he didnt notice
the bruises and the cut on your cheek
i kept away from the light

  just the same its funny i dont
like it

  maybe he thought id been drunk
and in a brawl ive been drinking a
lot lately

  i dont believe that either wise
guy charlton hefted the gun reflec-
tively and i stepped back one short
step

  he thought it over while minutes
went by

  turn around he said face the
other way

ml brain was on fire everything
had gone wrong hed kill me
now but i wasnt going to take it the
way he wanted me to no i said
if youre going to break my skull
with that cannon youll have to do it
while im looking

  he must have seen that i wasnt
bluffing this time sure he could have
got a wet towel or maybe used a drape
from the window to wrap around the
gun and muffle the explosion but in


detective fiction weekly

the meantime i was on the alert and
it would be dangerous he couldnt
take any chances now

   youre getting an awful lot of guts
all of a sudden he told me i hardly
heard him all i cared about was that
more time was passing

  take it any way you like i said
finally

  he had me-and yet he hesitated
he was yellow if he hadnt been i
often thought afterward he might yet
have won but he hesitated and he was
lost as a suspicion of that began to
seep into him he lunged swinging the
gun barrel at my head

  my elbow came up the cold steel
thudded on my forearm and something
cracked but at the same instant my
right fist sank with every ounce of
desperate strength in me behind it
into his midriff air whooshed out of
him and he leaned over me and i
butted his chin with the top of my
head i think he would have shot me
then not caring if he raised the roof
if i hadnt sunk my teeth into his gun
wrist i was using one arm around
him you see and the other was broken

  his knuckles were making pulp of
my face and his knee was ramming my
midriff but i was hanging onto that
gun wrist with my teeth for dear life
when we heard the bedlam of the
sirens

   then his left hand came over for the
gun i sank my teeth in the harder
my mouth was full of sickening sweet
blood it was flowing all over my chest
the gun dropped

  and that was when he got in the
haymaker with the bookend he grabbed
off the table ed struggled against

  i woke up and the room was full
of cops from the radio cars and benny
was kneeling beside me like a benign
imp of paradise the cops had charl-

ton theyd caught him on the lam
he was shot in the leg

   but that dummy- one of the cops
said later

   dont call benny nolan a dummy
i said hes a mute he came over
here to tell me there was a phone call
for me from a girl in colorado of
course charlton cant read sign lan-
guage so i pretended benny was tell-
ing me about him and benny caught
on and got out and called you give the
reward to him not me

   you guessed it the call was from
alice charlton you see was her
uncle the reason shed never told me
about him was that she was ashamed
after the trouble he got me into shed
tried to follow him and finger him
for the cops but he ditched her she
was afraid because hed said hed kill
her if she caused him trouble she did
see a lawyer and he told her she had
no proof which would save me i could
have teamed up with her uncle to rob
the liquor store when charlton went
to folsom she admitted to herself
she was licked and she went home and
got a job in a beauty parlor

  but when she read in the papers
about charltons escape she succeeded
in getting through a call to benny try-
ing to locate me and tell me about the
cache to which shed never returned
shed had an idea hed head for it
and we could trap him and make him
confess about me of course she hadnt
told bennys clerk that on the phone
shed only made it urgent about get-
ting in touch with me

   so charlton finally spilled and
theres talk in the state legislature about
compensation for the debt society owes
me but im not banking on that i
dont even like to think about the fact
that alices uncle goes to the execution
chamber next week
finger man



  for a while i was a little sore about
benny having cased the cottage and
found my gun and filed down the firing
pin so i wouldnt kill anybody the
best of intentions-he was worried
about me-but looking back wouldnt
you have been a little sore about that

too i got over it though and he got
the reward as i insisted

  you know what the little fool did
with the dough the day alice arrived
he made us a wedding present of the
down payment on this garage in glen-
dale sure were doing all right

shadow of doubt



  here were crowds of people and they
always seemed to be in carnival spirits
the babble of hucksters and barkers
vied with the music from dance halls
and the incessant gunfire from the
shooting galleries

  a fall of dry snow lay on the streets
it was several days old the air was
chill and crisp this was the evening of
january  

  suddenly as the policeman stared at
the throng he saw a young man dart
out of a doorway and start up the street
in the opposite direction he was a hat-
less young man with short black
bristling hair the patrolman hailed
him the youth paused saw the officer
then ran to him

  something awful has happened in
the rosen place he yelled i think its
murder

  the officer knew the young man he
knew it was harry mellum and that he
had roomed with the rosen family for
the past six months

  the rosen flat was a two-storied
brick affair fairly new and stood at
 west street there on the second
floor mrs goldie rosen lived with her
fourteen-year-old daughter bernice
mellum also had a room on the second
floor mrs rosen was considered in
that part of the city a wealthy woman
her fortune was invested in real estate

  something awful had indeed hap-
pened the officer found the body of
mrs rosen lying face up near the foot
of the basement stairs she had been
brutally murdered by many blows to
the head with some heavy weapon

tvhile the officer remained in the
basement mellum went upstairs
and phoned headquarters the call was
answered by detective supervisor john
hilborn and detectives charles with-
erille and arthur olson they des-

cended immediately to the clean well-
lighted cellar

  mrs rosens body lay near a pile of
ashes there were ashes on her shoes
and more ashes spread over the floor
this together with the fact she had
suffered wounds on her arms and hands
seemed to show that a prolonged scuf-
fle had taken place in the basement
before death

  the motive was apparent almost at
once hilborn found that an attempt
had been made by the killer to remove
a ring from the dead womans finger
in this he had been frustrated

  the weapon used in the murder was
found on the scene it was the crooked
rough-edge piece of iron used to shake
down the furnace grates there were
blood stains on it because of its uneven
surface there was no hope of getting
fingerprints

  the next step in the investigation was
to find the dead womans daughter
bernice mellum told the officers that
when he had returned home he had
gone upstairs to the living quarters and
found no one then on coming down-
stairs he had noticed the stairway door
open and found the body but he had
not seen bernice at all

  the supervisor decided to have a look
upstairs anyway and the group started
up the steps on the way up hilborn
noticed the presence of ashes on the
stairs and at the landing of the second
floor he discovered a stain of blood on
the wall he could distinguish the im-
print of a small hand it was as though
some one had stretched out a bloody
hand to sustain himself

  at the top of the stairs there was a
railinged balcony that overlooked the
first-floor hallway doors to the flat led
from the balcony one of them stood
open

  the flat itself hilborn noticed as


detective fiction weekly

he went inside and looked around was
comprised of six rooms running from
one end of the building to the other
the lights were on in all rooms it was
immediately obvious that an attempt
had been made to ransack the place and
that in the living room a womans poc-
ketbook identified as mrs rosens by
mellum had been opened and dropped
to the floor there were several bills of
sizeable denominations scattered about
this would indicate the killer-thief had
been surprised in his work

  the bedroom at the back was also
well lighted here in twin beds placed
flush against the walls at either side of
the room the rosens mother and
daughter slept and hilborn noticed that
the covers of one of the beds were
pulled all the way to the top there
seemed to be some object beneath them

  the supervisor stepped forward
quickly and pulled the covers down
a gasp of surprise went around the
room even the supervisor was not pre-
pared for the shock

  frightfully battered about the head
face and hands a young girl in white
pajamas lay there staring at the officers
with wide expressionless eyes it was
bernice hilborn felt her pulse it was
faint but she was still alive

he supervisor snapped out orders

  for an ambulance his men moved
instantly to obey and then suddenly
bernice sat up in bed how she did so
it would be impossible to tell there
was still that blank uncomprehending
stare in her eyes

  hilborn ordered some water and
when he received it he held the girl and
put the glass to her lips she took a sip
withdrew her lips -and looked at him
oddly

  who did it bernice hilborn
asked quietly

   bernice stared a moment longer then
her eyes closed and her body grew limp
and the detective slowly lowered her
to the bed she had lost consciousness
a short time later bernice was removed
to minneapolis general hospital physi-
cians gave her little chance to survive
i hey said the beating she had received
had been almost as severe as that given
her mother it was a miracle she had
lived at all

   in the meantime the detectives dis-
covered a few items at the scene of the
crime that only served to deepen the
mystery hilborn found that a door
leading from the second floor hallway
was ajar mellum assured him it had
never been used it was always securely
bolted from the inside

   exploring further the officer found
that the door opened upon a platform
and a flight of stairs that led to the back
yard the unroofed steps were covered
by three inches of snow and on these
steps the officer found a single set of
footprints obviously made by a man
that led down the stairs across the yard
and disappeared through an alley gate
that was the end of them

   these were freshly made prints made
that night what was important about
them was the fact they led away from
and not to the flat in other words the
killer had left by the back door but had
not come in that way

   how then did the killer get in
since there was only one other possible
entrance to the flat-the front entrance
from west street-it was obvious that
he had come through that way how-
ever hilborn found that recently a new
stout lock had been installed on that
door and that only four persons had
keys two of them were held by mrs
rosen and bernice a third by mellum
and a fourth by the caretaker-a man
named philip zimmerscheid the care-
shadow of doubt



taker worked days on questioning
both mellum and zimmerscheid were
completey absolved from any suspicion
in the murder

   the next step in hilborns logic then
was this the killer must have been let
into the house by mrs rosen herself
in other words the killer was not only
known to her but trusted by her he
probably lived in the neighborhood

  the mechanics of the crime were
fairly clear now to the officers after
letting the killer in mrs rosen had
falling for some pretense or other gone
with him to the basement and there fell
a victim to his blows her screams may
have aroused bernice the child came
downstairs in her pajamas she prob-
ably met the killer on the basement
stairs or in the hallway and was struck
several times and left for dead

hphe killer had then gone on upstairs

   and tried to rob the flat but bernice
had come to and crawled up slowly
leaving ashes and blood behind her and
also leaving the imprint of her hand on
the wall at the landing near the second
floor her appearance probably some-
thing unearthly must have petrified the
killer and he dropped the purse he was
rifling and fled at the nearest exit-
the back stairs that were never used

  meanwhile bernice had instinctively
groped about until she found her bed
and had covered herself completely with
the covers in her terror thus the offi-
cers had found her

  one other point hilborn made that
evening-the approximate time of the
murder he learned from a relative of
the rosens that bernice had telephoned
at about five minutes before ten oclock
and was then in good health and spirits
the crime had been discovered at
eleven-thirty

   it was three weeks later to the day

that bernice regained consciousness and
even this was not a complete awaken-
ing she merely opened an eye and
stared out from under a huge head dress
of bandages she moaned

  a policewoman carrie bystrom who
was garbed in a nurses uniform and
had orders to stand by during the emer-
gency was sitting at the bedside she
leaned forward and touched bernices
hand she spoke her name bernice
squeezed the policewomans hand to sig-
nify she understood that was all

  but the chances were brighter now
a more thorough examination later
showed that bernice had suffered both
contusion and concussion of the brain
she had lost the power of speech and
the entire left side of her body was para-
lyzed

  in a discussion of the case with hil-
born the hospitals acting superin-
tendent said bernice might never re-
cover from her paralysis and that her
memory might always be a total blank

  in other words the physician add-
ed amnesia

  still miracles have happened a few
weeks later bernice contracted a con-
tagious fever and had to be removed
to an isolation ward there naturally
the policewoman could not follow

  it was at the very height of this rag-
ing fever that bernice recovered her
voice and the use of her left side and
the incident was rather dramatic she
suddenly cried out that there was a
man in the hall who looks like the man
that hurt me

  as far as hospital authorities could
check there was no one in the hall at
the time or if there had been it would
necessafily have been a doctor intern
or orderly no one else was allowed
in the ward

  and apparently if bernice had any
sort of vision of the murderer it was
so

detective fiction weekly

only a flash she spoke no more of it
and when she recovered from the fever
she didnt recall the incident at all

  now outwardly bernice was well on
the way to recovery the injuries were
healing as expected but her memory
was at fault

as gently as possible supervisor
hilborn tried to take her over the
details of the crime he asked her how
or by whom she had been hurt the
look that came into her eyes was pitiful
to see she was frightened and at the
same time ashamed she wanted to help
she seemed to be reaching out through
impenetrable darkness for something
trying with all her might to push aside
the heavy curtain that divided the past
and finally she burst into tears

  i dont know she moaned i dont
know

  later a state psychiatrist told hilborn
he would have to be very careful how
he questioned the witness

  you know in these cases the patient
has a sense of inferiority and may fill
in the gap in memory with fancies or
dreams your case would then be worth-
less

  do you think shell ever recover
  i dont know that

  how am i to know when she has
recovered and is telling me the real
story-if she does hilborn asked

  youll know her story will check
with the material facts you have al-
ready gathered in the case

  meanwhile while he waited for ber-
nice to get well and hoped for the re-
covery of her memory too he thought
about the puzzle on west street from
a purely circumstantial point of  view
there was one point that gave him some
food for thought why had mrs rosen
gone to the basement with the killer
finally he got the nucleus of an idea

it came to him as he paced his office
one afternoon in april it was a dull
day a day characterized by a steady
tedious rain he put himself in the kill-
ers place and tried to think of a num-
ber of reasons he would be able to give
mrs rosen to get her to accompany
him to her basement at about ten oclock
on the evening of january 

  he could tell her he was an electrician
and that he had orders from his com-
pany to check on the wiring in the base-
ment that might not hold water she
might be suspicious then how about
pretending he was a plumber there was
a leak in the main might he have a look
at the pipes downstairs

  and yet hilborn believed that the
killer was not just any tradesman the
officer believed he was some one known
to mrs rosen then he remembered
that the instrument of death had been
a grate shaker perhaps it was on the
pretense of shaking down the furnace
fire that he lured mrs rosen to her
death perhaps the killer was a furnace
mender

  that was easily checked the officer
talked to the caretaker and asked if
at any time prior to the murder anyone
had been mending the furnace the an-
swer was yes

  a few days before the murder a man
had been sent over by the harris
brothers company on west street
to mend the grates in the furnace al-
though he had made several trips he
hadnt done a very good job of it the
repairmans name was kenneth palmer

  hilborn was elated at the success of
his logic he sent out a large number
of his men to cover the suspect and
find out all the information they could
about him they were not to arrest him
-just report on him

  this is what they found a few days
before the killing palmer had left the
shadow of doubt



employ of the harris brothers estab-
lishment where he had worked part
time at a small wage and took a full-
time job with the wpa

jje lived in the neighborhood he
occupied an apartment in a ten-
family apartment house at  west
lake street only a few doors distant
from the rosen flat palmer lived there
with his wife leila and a two-year-old
child

  palmers life was a peculiar one once
his family had been fairly wealthy his
father had been state highway engineer
and he had had a good schooling now
he was reduced to extreme poverty
although he lived quietly didnt drink
gamble or spend money in any foolish
manner he never seemed able to make
ends meet and both he and his family
were often the objects of charity

  would this sort of man prove a
criminal the police were only con-
cerned with getting factual evidence
was he near the scene of the crime when
it was committed  he certainly was not
far away did he show any sudden
wealth afterward that could not be
used conclusively because it was not
known whether the killer actually had
time to steal anything of value from the
flat

  thus for a time the police toyed with
the man unknown to himself until a
lively young officer dug up a record on
palmer it showed the ex-plumber had
been arrested in  for stealing an
automobile and a number of expensive
furs from a street corner although he
had been convicted of this crime his
youth had saved him-he was twenty-
two-from a prison sentence and he was
put on probation

  on the discovery of this record
palmer was arrested that was the eve-
ning of april  palmer made no pro-

test he went along quietly with the
detectives he was a thin good-looking
man there was a hurt patient look in
his eyes he didnt look like a killer

  at headquarters palmer gave the
officers an alibi for his movements on
the night of january   he said
he had prepared the alibi because he had
an idea he might be questioned

  after all i lived near the rosen
house he said and since i had a
record of theft i figured i might be
brought in as a suspect i recalled where
i was at the time of the murder and
what i did here it is

  thereupon he said that during the
afternoon he had spent a number of
hours with his mother who gave him
fifty cents when he left for home he
arrived home for supper at six oclock
during the supper hour he received a
call to be on hand for wpa work the
next day at a new location

  the supper his wife had prepared
didn t suit his tastes and later when he
went out for groceries he had the clerk
add a fictitious item to the relief order
and give him the cash for it this way
he obtained an extra twenty-five cents
with his fifty cents he had enough to
buy a good meal outside

t nine-thirty he returned
home with the groceries when he
entered the apartment he found some
visitors-mr and mrs ron richards
they were friends of his wifes

  about fifteen minutes later-

  the officers leaned forward it was
now getting close to the fatal ten oclock
the officers knew the murder had been
committed between ten and eleven-
thirty

   i ran out for some cigarettes i went
to a little confectionery store at  west
lake street mrs lyle runyon has the
shop

 how far was that from your
house 

  about ten minutes walk

  what time did you get back 

  i got home at ten-thirty exactly
i remember because the movie was just
getting out and several friends of mine
were going into the apartment they
had been to the movie they will verify
my story

  but you had been away from the
house forty-five minutes hilborn said
what did you do between ten and ten-
thirty 

  i took my time going back palmer
said i just strolled along smoking and
looking into windows i stopped at a
shooting gallery for a few minutes
surely you dont think there was time
to commit murder

  hilborn said the murder may have
been committed in fifteen minutes

  however there was nothing in the
alibi that proved one thing or another
despite its thorough checking by a
swarm of officers with the possible ex-
ception that it was not exactly an air-
tight one no matter how small the
margin of time palmer still was in
the vicinity and had just the sufficient
time to commit the murder

  on the other hand the officers could
find no one who saw him going into
the rosen flat or leaving it they found
no blood-stained clothes they found
no definite incriminating evidence

  there was this to consider though
during his grilling palmer kept his left
hand covered with his right hilborn
noticed it forcibly examined it and
found evidence of an old break in the
left index finger palmer explained he
got it cranking a car however
palmers wife said he had told her he
had received the break while running
for a street car

  and palmer had given still another

reason for the fracture to the physician
who repaired it he had said that a
piece of pipe had fallen on it during
work on a wpa job

  what was more important than all
these varied stories was the fact that
the fracture had come to light the day
following the crime coincidence-or
circumstantial evidence 

  these things were not enough to con-
vict palmer naturally the evidence
could hold him as a suspect but in a
court of law there was evidence much
stronger needed-the evidence of a wit-
ness-bernice

  little bernice had been getting along
very well under the expert care of staff
doctors and psychiatrists and by the end
of april she had recovered her bodily
health almost completely rather sud-
denly she announced that she now also
remembered what happened the night
her mother was killed

jljilborn listened to her story he
gave her no help no prodding of
any kind he listened carefully but si-
lently it was important that he should
check details of her story with known
facts

  i remember it was about ten oclock
when i went to bed she said in a clear
voice i had just called my aunt on the
phone and she told me it was bedtime
my mother was writing in the study
and she told me it was bedtime too

  i put on my pajamas i remember
they were white pajamas i rolled down
my mothers covers and my own and got
into bed and then i heard the doorbell
ring downstairs i heard mother get
up and go down

  i crawled out of bed and went to
the balcony and looked over i saw
mother push back the cloth curtain on
the front door and look out then she
opened the door a man stepped inside
shadow of doubt

s

he had on a zipper jacket and a cap
with a shiny visor they talked for a
moment and then went downstairs to
the basement

   a little later i heard mother scream
and i ran downstairs to see what had
happened i saw mothers body lying on
the basement floor the man with the
cap was coming upstairs he stopped
and looked at me he stared with burn-
ing eyes he had something in his hand
-an iron

  i remember he hit me with the iron
and then threw me to the cellar floor
beside my mother then he went on up
stairs

   i recall getting up and going up the
steps it was not painful i had no feel-
ing really i hardly knew what i was
doing all i knew was that i wanted
to get to bed-and hide from that awful
man with the iron

  he was there in the apartment he
had something in his hand he looked
at me and it dropped from his hand

i walked on in i could hardly see i
had my hands out before me i got into
bed and fainted

  with the narration finished hilborn
breathed easier as far as he was con-
cerned he was satisfied that bernice
had recovered her memory what she
had told him of the crime had fitted
perfectly with his own reconstruction
of the affair from the clues further-
more bernice had said she had put on
a pair of white pajamas that was true
the officers had found her thus dressed
on the night of the crime her memory
had obviously returned

  the detective supervisor then asked
bernice if she had ever before seen the
killer she said she had not would
she recognize him if she saw him again 
oh yes indeed

  in fact he looks much like our
laundryman she added

  checking this statement hilborn
found that the laundry and dry-clean-
ing man who serviced the rosens bore
a striking resemblance to kenneth
palmer

   the last step in the case was a most
elaborate one hilborn wanted it thus
on a sunlit morning in may the super-
visor brought bernice from the hospital
to police headquarters and took her to
the line-up room flanked by detectives
to whom she had now become accus-
tomed she showed a minimum of ner-
vousness

  when the lights were turned out and
only the spot lights left to illuminate
the platform at the front ten men were
paraded in front of the assembly they
were all sorts of men and dressed in
all sorts of clothes some appeared as
vagrants others as businessmen others
as workmen

  there was even one man dressed in
a zipper jacket and visored cap

qf the ten men several were de-
tectives three or four convicts and
one was palmer the purpose of the
elaborate precaution was obvious in a
case so filled with doubt hilborn could
not take chances bernice if she were
to recognize palmer as her mothers
murderer must recognize him under
the most adverse circumstances

  one of the last of the ten men to
take the platform dressed as never be-
fore in his life kenneth palmer stepped
up and faced the audience behind the
blinding lights hilborn felt bernice
stiffen there was a brief silence-then
an ear-splitting scream it came from
bernice hilborn felt her cringe and
felt her face buried against his coat

  finally he managed to reassure her
she said

   thats the one thats the man that
struck me with the iron


detective fiction weekly

  she identified kenneth palmer as her
assailant

  once more that morning bernice
identified palmer this time it was in a
close-up through a screen through
which she could see but not be seen
she stared at him not three feet away
and tremblingly said it was he who
had murdered her mother the identi-
fication was then complete

  but the trial was a long one the
state presented hilborns carefully
gathered evidence it was impressive
but not conclusive it remained for
bernice to take the stand again she
said that kenneth palmer was the killer

  defense attorneys attacked her testi-
mony with great vigor they brought
forth psychiatrists to show that one
with amnesia might unconsciously fill

in the vacuum with dreams doubt was
thrown on her story

  although the psychologists fought
bitterly over her testimony the jury
believed her and it was the jury that had
the final arbitration in the case palmer
was found guilty of first-degree murder
and sentenced to life imprisonment

  but the case was not entirely closed
although denying a new trial at the
time district judge paul carroll said
the case should never be considered
closed until there is evidence more
convincing than we have yet seen
against palmer for one who has heard
the testimony from beginning to end
there is a natural desire to know the
truth beyond the shadow of a doubt 

  appeals to higher courts by palmers
attorneys are still pending

by martin lehigh

a girl who gets in that kind of trouble needs a couple of g-men in

the family

she lay there in the bed buried she couldnt hear a sound it was more
alive in the dark room stiff with than quiet it was suspiciously quiet
fright trying to gather her wits and then her heart began to hammer
a moment before she had been fast even harder and she was sure that
asleep-shed put in a hard day-and there was someone in the room there
something had snapped her to trembling with her

wakefulness something had broken her perhaps you have roused in the
sleep so that she lay there in the bed black of the night suddenly alarmed by
staring into the opaque blackness her some unusual sound to lie abed listen-
heart pounding her mouth cottony ing over the hoarse rasping of your
cold 	own breathing for some threatening

she listened with all her mind and noise




detective fiction weekly

  that was the way it was with her
it seemed as if within the walls of
the bedroom she could hear another
persons breathing and she tried to
tell herself that her imagination was
working overtime that she was too
tired and that her nerves were playing
tricks on her

  be sensible she lectured herself
sternly it was only a car backfiring
on the street or one of the neighbors
slamming a door

  be sensible you goon she
thought laughing at herself youre
safe in your own bed in your own
apartment in the very center of a great
city no one would have any reason for
breaking in here

  be sensible she insisted to her-
self turn over and go back to sleep
but it wasnt that easy for that
fugitive whispering so much like the
breathing of another person was still
in the room and louder now

  a sudden surge of panic came over
her and she knew she couldnt just lie
there wondering if someone were in
the apartment shed have to find out
perhaps shed left the door unlatched
perhaps one of the windows on the fire
escape was open

  she was frightened now and still
she had to find out she wasnt the
kind of girl who can be frightened with-
out trying to do something constructive
about it

  she flapped the covers back legged
out of the bed stood on the carpet
peering vainly into the stygian murk
the autumn damp came in the window
touched her warm body with a chill
caress and she shuddered

  she began walking toward the door-
way-toward the light switch-and
she wondered if this was the way her
great-grandmother felt when she got
the old horse-pistol and chased the

  painted indians out of the pantry of
her log-cabin home

  the fugitive breathing seemed louder
now so clear she was almost sure that
this was no longer a trick of her imagi-
nation her knees felt water and she
sensed a scream welling up in her
throat

  that made her peeved that was the
sort of silly femininity of which she
didnt approve screaming and fainting
and peeking over the top of a fan were
mid-victorian luxuries in which a
modern business woman couldnt afford
to indulge

  her fingers went exploring for the
trip-switch of the light found it after
a trying moment of search she drew
a quick short breath and she snapped
it

  there were  two of them clean-
shaven hard-eyed young-about her
own age each held a shining pistol
in his hand and each pistol was yawn-
ing ominously at her 

he taller of them-the handsome
blond-grated dont scream if
you know whats good for you dont
scream he waved the gun a little
for emphasis

  i have no intention of screaming
she said boldly although a deep-seated
instinct in her was clamoring mightily
for her to scream may i ask what
you two are doing here

she thought i must stilt be asleep
things like this dont happen outside
of fiction im a poor hard-working
girl-important to no one really but
myself what are these men doing
here

  wheres your father-or is it your
brother or husband the shorter
swart fellow asked

father brother husband for
some reason it was as if shed never
make mine murder



heard the words before they didnt
make sense what do you mean
she asked i live here all alone

  i mean the doctor theres a sign
outside k cooper m d were look-
ing for the doctor where is he

  she managed a smile at that he
isnt here she explained he never
has been here

  the swart chap glared at her what
kind of a gag are you pulling what
you mean

  i mean im k cooper m d k is
for karen

  for cripe sake the shorter of the
two exclaimed a she-doctor he
turned to his blond companion with a
bitter quizzical expression say jim

i	thought you said-

  i said id heard that k cooper was
a good doctor but i didnt know she
was a woman i didnt know she was
a girl

  the swart fellow chewed on his lip a
couple of seconds damn it all jake
wont like that wasting all this time
coming to the middle of town to get
a female medico jake will be sore
not if we dont hurry the tall
blond chap contradicted if we dont
hurry he wont be sore at all hell be
dead thats what

  i guess youre right

  you know darned well im right
that boy scout bandage i stuck on his
leg is okay if we get a regular doctor to
him soon enough jim said but we
ought to hurry it up sam

  sam ran his hand along the side of
his blue-black jaw yeah thats true
he turned to karen cooper again
personally i dont like female doc-
tors but were in a hurry now we
havent got time to go shagging around
looking for someone else lets go

  it made her mad-good and mad
lets go nothing she flared you

  cant come in here at- she glanced
at the tiny clock on the table beside
the bed-at ten minutes after three
in the morning and order me around
now listen lady sam snarled
glaring at her with his black beady
eyes now just listen dont get tough
with me or-

  or what she snapped her lips
thin and her nostrils flaring perhaps
you gentlemen-and she underscored
the word-have made a mistake per-
haps youd better find yourselves an-
other doctor that is unless you want
to explain to the police how you hap-
pened to break in here armed

  look sam began again drawing
his words out like beads on a string
the way you talk to an idiot child
jakes my pal jake logan a hell of
a fine guy pies been hurt he needs
a doctor right away youre it even
if i have to carry you out of here in
your nightgown

  just a minute the tall man inter-
posed wait just a minute sam he
turned to karen and he turned on his
best personality smile sam is pretty
upset doctor cooper you know how
it is when your best friend has been
hurt he didnt mean to threaten you
like hell i didnt sam growled
no he didnt really mean that tough
stuff but this is a case of life or
death wont you please hurry into
some clothes and come with us

  she thought this is silly dont lis-
ten to the handsome blond devil youll
be a darned ninny karen cooper if you
dont get them out of here some way
get them out-theyre just a couple
of hoodlums-and go back to bed
youre not the kind of a girl who goes
traipsing around all over the country-
side at night with two strange gun-
men

  that was good sense get rid of


detective fiction weekly

them talk them into getting a man
doctor

  but her mouth said wait for me
in the living room ill be ready in a
few moments

  shell call the cops sam snarled
the telephone is in the living room
too karen countered ill hurry
and all the time she was dressing
she wondered why she was doing it
she could have chased them away
she could have yelled bloody murder
and made them run maybe she told
herself it was because of the way the
big fellow smiled in any case she
told herself she was nuts 

ii

the open-topped roadster was
maroon and low and rakish karen
cooper sat between her captors-she
couldnt help thinking that she was
more or less a prisoner-and watched
the miles of pavement glide beneath
the car

  through the city streets sam
crouched behind the wheel like a gnome
had maintained a cautious and ex-
emplary speed but now the houses had
thinned out and the glow of the city
was a long way behind them and the
needle of the speedometer was poised
nervously on seventy

  if karen cooper m d thought be-
fore that she was a fool her mental
comments now were neither ladylike
nor printable

  ive seen a dozen doctors shingles
along the way she shouted over the
whistling of the slipstream why
wouldnt one of them have done just
as well

  jim said hed heard about you-
the liar sam answered in a loud
voice he said hed heard you are a
mighty good sawbones

  im not that good karen com-
mented and if it was a question of
speed    

  well be there in a couple of minutes
more jim said its not far

  where are we anyway the girl
asked im completely lost

  just as well sam yelled bluntly
dont ask so many questions the less
you know the better it will be for
you

  that sounds like another threat
karen observed loudly

  you mustnt mind sam jim leaned
a little closer to say hes worried
sick about his pal jake and he doesnt
mean all he says

  the car headed into a curve to the
left and she let herself slip a little to-
ward jim his pal sams she
asked isnt jake your pal too

  the question seemed to startle him
to catch him off guard a bit well
sure he is sure but i havent known
him very long im-well-im what
you might call a new partner in the
business

  i see she said she stiffened her
spine again sat primly and impartially
between them and she rolled his
words over the tongue of her mind
she wasnt expecting any trouble but
if trouble developed it might be just
as well to know if there was any chance
of splitting them up-of getting some-
body on her side 

  the roadster swerved with a screech-
ing of brakes off the pavement dipped
into an archway of trees over a rutted
dirt road the lights bounded ahead
like a startled cottontail rabbit the
branches of the trees seemed to reach
out with greedy green tentacles and
the car slowed as if the hand of terror
had been laid on it too and as if it
dared not adventure deeper into the
gloomy woods
make mine murder



  for eight or ten minutes they jolted
forward too shaken to speak to one
another and then the auto nosed up a
steep washed driveway rolled bumpily
across a weedy front yard to come to
a protesting halt in front of a ram-
shackle unpainted oversized farm
building

  a feeling of horror clamped down
on karen cooper she had ventured
into some pretty awful places in her
time but this gaunt ominous wreck
of a house   

  sam snapped off the lights and as
if in sympathy the pale moon edged
from behind a black cloud to cast a
feeble and eerie moonshine

  come on sam yelled opening the
door on his side jakes inside

  karens heart was in her mouth
in spite of all her efforts to be calm
and logical she was suddenly fearfully
afraid

  she was grateful for jims firm
gentle grip on her elbow as she stum-
bled across the pockmarked lawn to-
ward the sulking shadowed house 

jjoctor karen cooper
straightened up walked to the
table in the dim-lit kitchen rinsed the
blood from her hands in the water in
the wash basin thats a good tourni-
quet she commented professionally
it saved jakes life

  jake hollow-eyed face washed white
with pain glared ather she-doctor
he spat

  sam the swart one lighted a ciga-
rette for jake stuck it in the sandy
mans slit of a mouth fired another for
himself at the stove jim was pump-
ing air into the kerosene burners put-
ting more water on to boil

  how bad is it doctor sam
queried how bad is that leg

  plenty bad karen said how

far was he from the shotgun when it
went off ten feet twelve

  sam coughed on his smoke shot-
gun

  certainly karen snapped please
dont think me a fool he was shot
with a shotgun at very close range
this man is jake reimer who escaped
from hungerford penitentiary at eleven
oclock tonight-last night i mean
jake glared at her even more fiercely
from those pain-rimmed sunken eyes
sam said and what else do you
know doctor cooper

  it was on the radio this evening
karen explained jake reimer notori-
ous international agent imprisoned on
charges of sabotage and espionage es-
caped from hungerford tonight at
eleven oclock guards after firing on
him vainly in an attempt to frustrate
his prison break agreed that one of
them at least had hit the fugitive as
he went over the wall in a well-planned
break

  she poked at her hair well they
were right about hitting him take a
look at that leg-

  how bad is it sam croaked
what you going to do doctor

  she opened her bag of instruments
handed some of them to jim you
put on a good tourniquet can you
sterilize these

  he nodded and she began taking
out bandages bottles rubber gloves
pads

  what you going to do doc sam
croaked again whats all that stuff
for

  youd better go outside and smoke
a pack of cigarettes sam karen said
youre liable to get sick if you stay
in here jim will have to pitch in and
act as my nurse because that leg has
to come off

  sam stared at her with bugged


detective fiction weekly

horrified eyes come-off you mean
-amputate it

  thats right karen said firmly
im going to amputate it

  beads of sweat were breaking out
on sams face the cords of his neck
had grown thick and taut but you
cant do that he yelled

  dont tell me what i can or cant
do karen countered savagely any
doctor would have told you the same
thing the knee joint is smashed be-
yond any possible chance or hope of
repair the rest of the leg is simply
hanging there on threads of flesh the
wound is full of shot and its only a
question of hours before gangrene sets
in

  she stared straight into sams
fiery black eyes if you want jake
to live that leg has to come off

  but-but its impossible i tell you
sam screamed jake wont be any
good without that leg he wont be
able to work and what will mr greegg
say

  shut up you fool jake rasped
from between his strained thinned lips
you talk too much besides youre
not the doctor and she is and one
thing more-its my leg

  yeah but-

  shut up jake reimer repeated
go on outside and let them get to
work on it if i can stand it i guess
you can

  sam slumped out of the room mut-
tering profanely to himself jim brought
over the surgical instruments boiling
in a saucepan of water

  i havent nearly enough anasthae-
tic karen said to reimer sorrow-
fully surely not enough for this job
im afraid well have to strap you
down

  probably that would be wise the
most infamous saboteur in america

agreed gamely he even managed a
deaths-head grimace which was meant
to be a reassuring smile 

jt was over and karen cooper
stood at the wash basin scrubbing
the blood from her small nervous
hands she rinsed a big blot of it from
one elbow glanced with distaste at
the trickle of it which marched down
the front of her dress where in spite
of the improvised operating apron she
had worn it had soaked through

  jim white-faced with open admira-
tion in his blue eyes stood waiting his
turn to wash on the bed where he
had been put after the gory business
jake reimer stared at the ceiling with-
agonized half-mad eyes

  karen wiped her instruments be-
gan packing them back into her kit
you were a big help jim she said
frankly i couldnt have done it with-
out your help

   you did the job jim said huskily
you were-you were great

  she laughed almost nervously
well i will say that we couldnt
have done a lot better in the best and
newest operating room in the country
its a good clean job and i feel pretty
sure that it will be all right lucky for
jake that you put that tourniquet on
so well

  she put the last of her equipment
back into the bag well thats all
i can do now if he hasnt bled too
much and if hes tough enough hell
pull through all right i guess ill be
going along

  sure jim said samll drive you
back

  he held the door open for her and
they both stepped out onto the shadowy
porch moonlight played over the weedy
lawn and karen exclaimed

but wheres the car
make mine murder



  for that low rakish maroon road-
ster wasnt there

  jim seemed every bit as surprised
as she was maybe he pulled it around
to the side of the house he climbed
down the steps ploughed his way
through the waves of tall grass to the
corner of the building peered into the
weird halflight came back

  hes not there he reported
well this is a fine thing karen
said exasperated how am i going
to get back

 jim had no answer for this

  what kind of monkey business is
this anyway the girl demanded
what the dickens-

 look jim interrupted he
pointed and she turned to see the twin
lights of a car picking their way to-
ward the farmhouse

  they watched as the roadster swished
to a stop in the front yard watched as
sam legged out and climbed up on the
porch beside them

  hows jake sam asked all
through

  yes karen said hell be all
right i think and now if you please
you can take me back home

  and have you report this to the
police

  what do you mean naturally i
have to make a report of the treat-
ment of a gunshot wound

its a good thing i got back when
i did its a good thing i talked on
the telephone to mr greegg he says
youre to stay here until he arrives
what karen queried icily

  mr greegg says that youre not
to leave here until he gets here

  and who is this highhanded mr
greegg the girl asked fiercely who
is he to tell people what i may or may
not do

  hes the man i work for sam

said in a sharp tone of finality

  and what if i do not choose to
stay here until the high and mighty
mr greegg comes

  im afraid you havent any choice
in the matter sam said with a low
laugh ill see to it that you stay any-
way tied up and gagged if necessary
he took a firm grip on her arm
lets go back inside dr cooper
were not going to do any more joy-
riding tonight

  she had half-expected that jim would
speak up for her but he didnt he
held the door open again and weak-
kneed thoroughly frightened she al-
lowed sam to escort her back into that
oppressive room   

ill

bu she didnt stay subdued like
that for very long not karen
cooper the girl who had fought her
way through medical school and who
had fought her way into a nice little
practice in a very tough town for new
doctors

  the more she thought about it the
madder she got so for a while she
sat there in the chair beside jake rei-
mers bed listening with half a mind
to his pained breathing watching with
one eye the sweat of reaction to the
operation breaking out on his fore-
head

  then she got up walked over to
the table helped herself to one of sams
cigarettes she stood there fired it
blew out a lungful of smoke

  now look boys she began lets
be reasonable about this naturally i
have to report this operation it would
cook my goose if i didnt but i dont
have to hurry about that report you
two and jake can be long-gone before
i pick up the telephone


detective fiction weekly

  no sam growled

  why not she went on trying to
reason with him its nothing to me
personally if youre on the wrong side
of the law i dont care if you break
open half a dozen prisons as a matter
of fact ill have to admit that i have
a certain admiration for your loyalty to
jake but my feeling is this id like
to get home and get to bed ive got
a big day ahead of me tomorrow
no sam roared

  shed give us a break sam jim
offered shes a square-shooter
no sam repeated venomously
she cant leave until mr greegg gets
here

  jim walked toward the bed where
jake reimer was lying what do you
think jake dont you think sam ought
to take her back shes been a mighty
good skate isnt that true

i dont know jake croaked its
up to sam i just hope you wont jabber
away all night i dont feel so good
shes staying here until the big
boss comes sam reiterated savagely

  karen could hold herself in no
longer listen you wall-eyed
monkey she flared ive done my
job ive been damned decent and
now i want to know if youre going to
take me back home or not

  no sam answered adamantly
im not

  then this is a kidnapping she
queried

  you can call it that what differ-
ence does it make

  itll make some difference when
the g-men come into the picture
g-men sam pulled himself out
of his slouch and there was a cold
reptilian look in his eyes what do
you know about the g-men

  plenty karen said ive got a
brother whos a g-man and when

he telephones me tomorrow and theres
no answer sparks are going to fly
sam got up from the chair and sud-
denly there was a click and there was
a vicious razor-edged knife in his hand
so your brother is a g-man eh

  she stood her ground yes and
he eats little punks like you for break-
fast

  sam turned his basilisk eyes toward
jim so what the hell is this jim
how is it that you were so insistent
about getting a doctor who has a g-
man for a brother

  jim snapped up from where he was
sitting dont be a droop sam how
in thunder could i know that she had
a g-man brother

  i dont know sam admitted but
it sounds kind of funny besides i still
dont know a hell of a lot about you
i just hired you on this job because
you were down on your luck and des-
perate and big and strong and kind
of dumb he looked bitterly at karen
and then back at jim again but if
i thought there was some connection
between you two-

  karen laughed scornfully that
pretty-faced hoodlum  she sneered i
wouldnt give him a glass of water in
hell

  hell sam jim said earnestly
you know im honest you know what
fatso fredericks and the other boys
said

  sam looked at him a little dubiouslv
still but his thumb pressed a button
and the knife snapped shut again
i guess its all right he said be
grudgingly well see when mr
greegg gets here

  he turned to karen and his eye-
squinted dangerously sit down over
there and shut up dont try to make
a sneak or ill whittle you into tooth-
picks
make mine murder



  he reached into his coat pocket
pulled out a pack of cards how about
some more rummy at a dollar a game
jim

  sure jim agreed

  ive got some money can i play
too karen asked cheerfully

  damn sam growled you would
get a woman in on this job oh well
come on

jutr greegg had not come they
had played rummy for hours and
sam had won sixteen dollars in the
east the first light of morning was
edging over the horizon to tint the low-
hanging clouds with pink and gold
but still mr greegg had not ar-
rived

  and to karen during those hours
of waiting the time away the mans
very name had grown more and more
ominous what kind of man would
have a name like greegg what kind
of man would hire sam to help a crimi-
nal and a traitor like jake reimer to
escape from the penitentiary

  isnt it time for breakfast maybe
jim asked finally when sam laid down
another hand and collected another
dollar from each of them

  sam glanced at his watch on his
hairy wrist yes i guess it is he
admitted go ahead and wrestle some
grub together will you jim

  jim smiled howd you like to have
some real good home cooking
what do you mean

  jim turned his head so he was look-
ing at karen she ought to be able to
cook

  thats right sam said enthusi-
astically thats a good idea go- put
her to work have her whip up a big
breakfast with plenty of strong black
coffee he yawned got any ciga-
rettes 

  you smoked the last of mine jim
answered

  mine too karen said

  well dont let her get away jim
im going to run down to the village
for some more smokes i wont be more
than ten or fifteen minutes

  hey karen exclaimed dont i
have anything to say about this
either

  not a thing jim replied amiably

  she got up from the table went over
and laid a cool hand on jake reimers
feverish wrist his heart was all right
and he was still sleeping she felt more
than a little proud of herself it had
been under very trying circumstances
a mighty handsome operation even if
she said so herself

  sam rose from the table stepped out
on the porch where the dawn light
inched across the warped floorboards

  come on jim called to karen

  what

  come on and start breakfast

  she could feel an angry blush creep-
ing up her neck you didnt really
mean that did you  she asked furious

  certainly i did a girl ought to
know how to cook even if she is a
doctor

  youve got another think coming
she flared im not your wife

  she felt her fingers trembling with
her ire 

  no jim answered laughing at
her but maybe you may be before
im through with you

  she couldnt trust herself to speak
one of -those female instincts she had
tried desperately to overcome was tug-
ging at her she wanted to cry with
her anger and at the same time she
wanted to rake her fingernails down
his smiling face

  outside she could hear the door of
the roadster slam could hear the roar

of the motor as sam stepped on the
starter gears meshed not too silently
and the exhaust coughed and the grass
swished against the moving tires

  jim crossed the room swiftly sil-
ently to jake peered down at the
saboteur the man was obviously deep
in sleep the blond giant turned swiftly
to karen all right make it snappy
spill some stuff around as if you had
been busy getting breakfast i can say
then that you escaped the second my
back was turned

  what do you mean

  im giving you a break you ninny
he whispered hoarsely nows your
chance to get away but in order to
make it good youll have to set the
stage a little hurry up get the coffee
on and some bacon frying and then
you get over to that little clump of
woods and start making tracks for
the highway as fast as ever you can

che was running she was running
with all her might and main be-
hind her in the house on the stove
it looked as if she had been stirring
up some biscuits a pot of coffee was
boiling bacon was sizzling in a fry-
ing pan

  she didnt understand what this
was all about and she wasnt wasting
any time trying to understand for some
unknown reason jim was giving her a
break-giving her a chance to escape
and that was the important thing

  her heart was pounding like mad
her pulse throbbing wildly in her
temples her legs ached from the sud-
den and unaccustomed exercise and
she thanked her lucky stars that she
was wearing sensible low-heeled shoes

  she came to the edge of the woods
plunged into the tangle of brush and
thickets for just a momentshe turned
saw that jim was standing on the

rickety porch of the ramshackle house
she thought he was waving to her

  then she went on hot damp panting
get to the highway he had said thumb
a ride

  the thorns and the briars had cut her
stockings to ribbons had lashed her
legs and bare arms until they were
streaked with blood

  she tried to pick her way through
the tangle and the progress she made
while being cautious was agonizingly
slow but when she tried to hurry she
kept hurting herself

  keep away from that road jim had
warned dont go to the highway by
the road its too dangerous go cross-
country

  but she wasnt sure that she could
ever make it going cross-country she
wasnt sure of her directions and the
struggle against the underbrush was
taking a terrific toll of her strength

  and then suddenly she fought her
way through an especially clinging mass
of thicket and found herself on the
road for a moment she was lost
which way should she go and then
she took a few steps forward and the
going was so much better  the temp-
tation was so great that she yielded

  after all she could hear a car com-
ing if sam came back before she got
to the highway she could leap off into
the cover of the bushes and she simply
couldnt battle her way across any more
of the rough country

  she began running again as fast as
she could go she had to hurry she
would send police or something

  so it happened that the car was upon
her before she could hide as she had
intended it came over a quick hump
in the road only seventy or eighty
yards away not sams car-a big
black limousine with lots of chrome
trim and white-walled tires
make mine murder



  like a frightened rabbit karen
leaped from the rutted dirt road
plunged headlong into the labyrinth
of the small growth

  but she was too late she had been
seen the car came to a stop with a
shrill squealing of brakes and the doors
swung open and the three men were
after her like three bloodhounds

  she ran until she thought her heart
would explode she ran until her stom-
ach churned with nausea and finally
she could run no more and she fell to
the spongy earth tried to crawl under
a thorny briar

  that is when they caught her hard
cruel hands closed on her shoulders
and arms dragged her out like the
hounds pull a fox from a hollow log

  she knew she was on the verge of
hysteria but she fought it down she
bit her lips but shed be damned if she
would cry for them

  they pulled her back toward the car
not too gently an older man dressed
like a rural banker-with a rural
bankers round stomach and pince-nez
glasses-was standing beside the car

  so you got her he said in a soft
musical voice thats good thats
very good indeed

  he turned to karen and he spoke
in a tone which was almost a caress
what a silly silly girl youve been
what a childish way to act

  who-who are you she gasped
for her breath was still tight and pain-
ful who are you

  why the little fat man said ami-
ably i thought you knew my dear
i thought perhaps that was why you
were running im mr greegg

iv

qnce again karen cooper sat a
prisoner in the car as it drove
up the slope toward that forlorn farm-

house this time she was sitting on
the backseat of the swank black lim-
ousine between mr greegg and one
of his strong-arm boys

  the car came to a stop and they
got out went up to the house the
biscuit dough was still standing on
the stove the coffee was boiling aro-
matically the bacon was smoking furi-
ously jake lay on his bed still snoring
lightly jim was not there

  hello called mr greegg melodi-
ously where is everyone

  one of the henchmen still out on
the porch said here comes some-
one now hes running out of the
woods over there

  karen turned with mr greegg
looked through the door jim was
running up the slope his clothes were
in rags and he was slashed and bleed-
ing from the briars

  he came running across the over-
grown lawn bounded up the steps to
the porch shoved past the three hench-
men into the room

  so there you are you hell-cat he
snarled at karen he raised his hand
as if he were going to slap her face
so you tried to get away did you
for a moment karen was speech-
less she was having an awful time
choking down the tears and then she
flared yes you low-down pretty-
faced stumblebum

 now now mr greegg said
softly lets have no unpleasantness
please lets remember that were ladies
and gentlemen he turned to jim
you must be the man sam was talk-
ing about you must be jim riley
thats right jim answered and
youre mr greegg

  i am the fat little man replied
with great dignity and now would
you mind telling me just what has been
happening here wheres sam


detective fiction weekly

  sam went to town to get some ciga-
rettes jim explained she- he
pointed to karen-was getting us
some breakfast i went outside just
for a minute and when i came back
she had taken it on the lam

  mr greegg nodded i see and
what happened then

  well i burst right out trying to
catch her and when i was down there
trying to follow her trail i saw your
car flash past on the road so i came
back

  very commendable mr greegg
said jovially and she i suppose is
the doctor sam telephoned me about
thats right

  well my dear the tubby little
man said to karen it still strikes me
that breakfast is a good idea would
you mind resuming where you left off
an omelet would be splendid if you
havent many eggs you might try add-
ing a little flour and beating it well
youll find that does wonders

  karen was speechless at the mans
aplomb she walked over to the stove
began cooking in earnest now where
she had only been setting the stage
before

  she was just putting the biscuits
into the oven when another car drew
up outside and a moment later sam
came into the room

  hello there sam mr greegg
said too bad you were late for the
excitement

  excitement sam queried

  yes mr greegg said quite
thrilling he pointed to jim in his
tattered clothes and he pointed to
karen who knew that she must be
looking a fright

  what happened to them sam
growled

  nothing much mr greegg ex-
plained simply that the charming

young lady was rude enough to try to
avoid us-as a matter of fact she was
running away from this idyllic rustic
spot and the handsome young man
filled with chivalry no doubt was try-
ing desperately to bring her back
the hell you say

  i wouldnt have put it exactly that
way mr greegg said mildly but
those are my general sentiments he
turned to karen is the breakfast
ready my dear and when she
nodded very well then lets feast
for if the sweet damosel can cook as
she sprints this will be indeed a fine
repast

now said mr greegg finishing
his hearty breakfast and wiping
his lips delicately on a paper napkin
lets see whats what something was
said i believe about an amputation
one of jake reimers pedal extremi-
ties i understand was badly injured
and had to come off

  thats right sam agreed

  and this slip of a girl actually cut
off his leg

  yes jim answered she did
mr greegg i watched her and it was
sort of wonderful to see her work
is that so astonishing the fat
little man exclaimed beaming around
at the company simply astonishing
he tamped a cigarette very precisely
on an ultra-expensive gold cigarette
case and by now i trust the opera-
tion is finished poor jake is actually
minus one of his legs

  yes karen replied with care
he should have no complications at
all

  mr greegg smiled benignly and
youre positive dr cooper that you
did the proper thing there was no
hope of saving the leg another doc-
tor perhaps    
make mine murder



  when i arrived karen answered
there was nothing else to do as a
matter of fact it was imperative that
the operation be done as quickly as
possible as it is i can say safely that
after he recuperates jake will be just
as good as new

  mr greegg exhaled a lungful of
blue smoke i hope you wont think
me rude he said sweetly to karen
if i make up my own mind on that
point 

  he turned to sam may i ask how
you happened to procure the service of
such an amazingly skillful and beauti-
ful surgeon

  well sam replied jim here had
heard of her he didnt know she was
a woman-i mean a lady-and he
didnt know about her brother being
a g-man

  ah breathed mr greegg so
her brother is a g-man isnt that in-
teresting what a curious thing
karen felt a chill run through her
by now she perceived that mr greegg
in spite of his elegant manners and
rather extravagant language was really
an ominous character

  no sam went on it was just
one of those things i guess

  yes mr greegg agreed suavely
im afraid its just an unfortunate set
of circumstances

  what do you mean sam ques-
tioned

  as you might have surmised mr
greegg explained patiently i com-
missioned you to get jake reimer out
of prison for a purpose

  sure sam said you wanted him
to throw a monkey-wrench into the
tva in order to tie up the rearma-
ment program wasnt it

  your memory is better than your
discretion mr greegg chided mildly
that was the general idea and

now- he sighed profoundly-and
now im afraid that it was trouble to
no avail now im afraid that jake
has outlived his usefulness to me

  he snuffed the cigarette elaborately
yes jake has outlived his usefulness
more than that he has become un-
fortunately a serious danger to me
sick a fugitive from prison helpless
he might imperil my whole plan of
operation

  mr greegg glanced idly about the
room and finally locked gazes with
sam

  what do you mean sam asked
hoarsely

  its very simple mr greegg re-
turned calmly elementary the time
has come to put poor jake out of his
misery the time has come for poor
jake to die

jyjr- greegg didnt raise his voice
on those last words as an elec-
tric shock coursed through karen and
a feeling of panic and horror seized
upon her she noticed that mr greegg
showed no emotion whatsoever on his
fat bland face it was exactly as if he
were saying it would be pleasant to
have broiled lamb chops for lunch
a frightening change had come over
sam though his black beady eyes
seemed glazed his adams-apple was
working furiously as he tried to make
his dry throat swallow his fingers
splayed and unsplayed nervously

  you cant kill jake sam yelled
you cant kill him hes my pal
hes in the way hes dangerous to
us and the cause mr greegg re-
peated almost meekly

  but you cant kill him like a-like
a horse with a broken leg

  what a poetic comparsion mr
greegg exclaimedi would never had
suspected it of you sam


detective fiction weekly

  he fixed his gaze on the swart little
man and the soft warm expression in
his eyes turned cold and hard and
cruel this is a fine chance to test
your loyalty to me sam mr greegg
said in an ominously low voice well
see if you are willing to put the cause
ahead of everything else

  sam looked at him hypnotized by
the evil aura exuding from the man
what-what do you mean

  i mean im certainly not going to
kill poor jake not that i have any
scruples understand life is cheap in
this world and given the choice be-
tween a mans life and a great ideal
ill make mine murder every time
oh sam sighed so youve
changed your mind youre not going
to kill him after all

  no mr greegg said i havent
changed my mind i am not going to
kill jake-you are

  the blood drained out of sams
face leaving it a pale sick green he
opened his mouth to speak but it was
nearly a full minute before any words
would come out me he mumbled
me kill jake

  thats right mr greegg an-
swered cheerily you

  no bleated sam i-i cant
jakes my pal i-wont

  you refuse mr greegg asked
as if this were a particularly appetizing
morsel of gossip you reject my or-
ders you refuse

  yes sam declared stoutly i
cant do it i wont

  karen was watching mr greegg
fascinated by the utter cruelty and black
evil of the sinister man and yet even
watching him she never knew where
that stubby gun came from one mo-
ment mr greeggs puffy manicured
fingers were playing with the heavy
gold chain which dangled importantly

across his rotund stomach the next
moment those same fingers were
wrapped snugly around the metal butt
of an ugly snub-nosed automatic-the
index finger was curled eagerly around
the trigger-and the gun was barking

  no warning no display of anger
mr greeggs chubby face still wore an
expression of amused indifference as
the bullets tore viciously into sams
belly

  sams mouth opened to cry out but
death stole his last breath away he
coughed once bloodily he swayed a
moment from the awful impact of the
slugs and then he sagged like a cube
of sugar dropped in a cup of hot coffee
he spilled to the floor dead even as
karen watched thunderstruck and hor-
rified even as her mind quickly
summarized professionally the sicken-
ing damage which those bullets must
have done

  mr greegg thrust the still-smoking
automatic back into his side coat
pocket he was still wearing his good-
humored expression too bad he
commented in a voice with no trace
of sorrow evidently i was wrong
ill have to do that little job on jake
myself

  he turned to karen and jim with
a cherubic smile on his amiable round
face now i know you wont object
if i lock you two up in a couple of the
upstairs rooms

  why jim asked

  that should be obvious mr
greegg commented smoothly i have
to settle the little affair with jake and
then i have to determine what to do
with you two his eyes twinkled
merrily as he looked at karen i as-
sure you it wont take me very long
to make up my mind about you my
dear not the sister of a g-man oh
goodness no
make mine murder



v

jhe thought she was going to faint

  mr greegg nodded to his three
henchmen grinned their faces were
characterless blurs to her but she felt
the hard fingers close on her arm felt
herself pushed weak-kneed into the
hallway and up the creaking sagging
stairs behind her the other two came
with jim

  her captor thrust her roughly into
a room locked the door decisively be-
hind her she could hear the three of
them tramp loudly back downstairs
again knew that jim was locked in his
room too

  the sunlight which streamed through
the paneless window acted only to make
that dingy room seem more unreal a
ghastly floral wallpaper hung in rib-
bons on the walls in the corner stood
a sagging brass bedstead with a lumpy
mouldy mattress a rickety chair and
a disheartened antique bureau filled
the complement of furniture

  and as she stood there in the
shambles a sharp brutal note sounded
from the floorboards it was a moment
before she really understood what it
was then an uncontrollable shudder
shook her body and she slumped into
the woebegone chair while her nerves
jangled and her stomach knotted with
a dreadful nausea

  for it had been a shot obviously
mr greegg had calmly pumped a
bullet into helpless jake reimers
brain

   she was still sitting there exhausted
sick fearful when she heard hername
whispered karen karen girl quick
theres no time to lose

  the words seemed to come myster-
iously from the cracked plaster of the
wall her head snapped up who is
it what

  jim came the tense whisper
ive found a tiny hole through the
wall here ill stick a straw through
it

  she watched saw a straw peak
through a crack in the wall she got
up peered into the crack one of jims
blue eyes shone on the other side

  dont talk whisper jim cau-
tioned

  why she whispered back

  weve still got a good chance we
dont want mr greegg and the others
to hear

  what can i do to help karen
asked

  the strength was flowing back into
her again if there was a fighting
chance she was ready to take it it was
the abject hopelessness of her situation
which had snapped her energies before

  have you got a mirror jim
breathed i cant find one in here

  why in heavens name do you want
a mirror she asked

  dont start a lot of questions have
you got one

  no she replied my compact is
downstairs in my coat pocket the only
other mirror is the dental reflector in
my kit thats downstairs too

  how about in the room there no
mirror not even anything shiny

  she glanced around saw the small
shard of mirror still stuck in its frame
above the bureau wait a minute
she whispered urgently

  she crossed to the antique piece of
furniture tried to slip the fragment of
glass loose it was stuck she got a
bobbypin out of her hair prized it
loose holding it in her hand she
went back to the crack in the wall

  ive got a little piece she said
triumphantly but i cant push it
through the wall to you shall i throw
it from my window to yours


detective fiction weekly

  no jim answered hastily too
dangerous i might not catch it here
tie a string around it so you can swing
it to my window without the chance
of its being lost

  where am i going to get a piece
of string she demanded pettishly i
thought i did pretty well to get the
mirror in the first place

  rip off a long strip of your dress
make a string out of your stockings
anything only make it quick

  she began ripping a narrow band
from the bottom of her skirt i paid
seventeen dollars for this she said
laughing

  ill buy you another if we get out
jim promised if you dont hurry
youll be wearing a shroud next me
too

  she tied the strip of cloth to the
shard of mirror went to the paneless
window swung it gently toward jims
window

  his brown strong hand reached
out plucked it from the air

  now watch jim breathed to her

  by craning her head awkwardly out
the window she could see the mirror
fragment in one of his hands he held
it in the bright sunlight and the re-
flection flashed across the clearing to
that dense patch of woodland where
jim had told mr greegg he was hunt-
ing for karen after her escape

  his other hand moved quickly in
front of the glass a signal morse
code

  and even as she watched there was
an answering series of flashes from
somewhere on the fringe of the woods

  karen could have shrieked with joy
whoever jim was he had friends out
there and whoever they were they
couldnt be worse than mr greegg and
his surly henchmen

  but at that very moment when

things were looking brighter again
karen heard the clumping of footsteps
on the protesting stairs in spite of her-
self-in spite of the effort she had al-
ways made not to be weakly feminine
karen cooper screamed jim theyre
coming

  at that very instant while she was
gasping for more breath men began
to break from the cover of that wood-
land started racing pellmell toward the
house

  on the heels of that mr greegg
began to shout tony george
harry were trapped well have to
fight for it

jn less than a minute the battle

  was on ihere was the staccato
chattering of machine guns there was
the sharp angry spatting of pistol
shots

  the men from the woods deployed
like soldiers taking advantage of every
speck of cover they kept crowding in
relentlessly

  it seemed to karen that she could
feel the house tremble under that
furious hail of lead downstairs there
was savage shouting wild cursing as
the beseiged men broke out windows
and prepared to sell their lives as dearly
as possible

  karen drew back from the window
as a stray bullet thudded into the wall
too close for comfort she sat down
in the chair again close to the door
and for some strange reason she was
amazingly calm

  she realized with the age-old wis-
dom of woman that there wasnt any-
thing she could do one way or an-
other until the battle was over

  then she heard a loud splintering
noise quite near and a moment later
there was another as the door of her
room was battered in
make mine murder



  jim stood there in the frame of the
doorway his hair was as wild as that
of a fuzzywuzzy he had a bad scratch
across his jaw and on his chin

  he started to laugh ill be
damned he exclaimed you look as
cool as a cucumber

   i am karen cooper replied

  and i nearly broke my neck get-
ting in here to comfort you if you
were frightened

  ive run out of fright she said
i used it all up with mr greegg
havent you any normal decent
womanly weaknesses

  what do you mean

   why at a time like this most girls
would be begging to be held in my
arms and to be protected from harm
well you might try it karen sug-
gested archly maybe it would make
you feel better

  and he did with hell popping all
around them-with bullets singing
through the window and knocking
chunks of plaster from the ceiling-he
pulled her up roughly from the chair
and he kissed her hard

  to tell the truth she didnt mind
to tell the truth she rather liked
it 

rphe fury of the gun-fighting abated

  there was a rending crash as the
attackers beat down the front door of
the farmhouse and the building echoed
with the tramping of many feet

  hey jim a voice called up the
stairs weve got the big shot hes
surrendered the rest of them are dead
come on down

  an electric thrill surged through
karen cooper she knew that voice
she ought to it belonged to a man
named bill cooper and he was her
brother

   karen looked at jim quizzically

  thats right he said nodding
im a g-man too i have been work-
ing undercover to get to this mr
greegg whos the leader of the most
dangerous group of saboteurs in amer-
ica-fifth columnists of the worst
kind

  and you knew about bill all the
time

  sure from the moment i first saw
you i knew we were going to be just
like brothers 

  he laughed as a matter of fact
it was knowing bill that made me in-
sist on getting you when we needed a
doctor i knew youd be bound to come
through in a pinch

  hey jim jim riley bill cooper
yelled are you hurt

  no jim answered im on top
of the world

  well come on down and tell us
about it

  together they went down the
stairs karen gave a kiss to her sur-
prised brother-even she would have
to admit that it wasnt as good a kiss
as the ones shed been giving jim
riley-and listened while jim told the
details of the business to divisional
chief wright

  as you know chief jim said
after trying vainly to get to the top
of this ring for four or five months
we decided this was the only way to
turn the trick

  he pointed to mr greegg who was
sitting on a chair by the stove nursing
a battered hand crying ancblubbering
like a three-year-old

  hes the big shot this turned out
better than i had hoped especially at
the windup when it looked as if youd
be too late to save our necks

  but have we got him cold chief
wright queried with all the money
and influence he has he can beat this


detective fiction weekly

charge of resisting arrest-he can claim
he didnt know we were g-men
weve got him cold jim asserted
firmly he killed sam-jim motioned
to the sprawled body-and there are
two eye-witnesses to that cold-blooded
murder

  that seems to clean it up chief
wright agreed its a good job amer-
icans will live safer because of this
days work

  jim riley took karens arm led her
out of the room onto the cool porch
listen he said earnestly ive got

one more thing i want to ask you
  whats that

  youre a hard-boiled professional
woman arent you no lace or frill or
stuff like that

detective fiction weekly

the peacemaker after seeing one eve-
ning an assemblage which consisted of
the police commissioner the mayor
four homicide squad men joe kelsey
a gangster five bodyguards and strong-
arm men all eating in peace and quiet
verily the lion had sat down with the
lamb

  timothy coffin accepted this state as
well as did kelsey and the boys they
were there to eat not to fight so it
was with some surprise this particular
thursday evening when tim coffin
was stirred by a hint of violence for
the first time

  he had been sitting in his booth his
plate of spaghetti steaming before him
on a checked red-and-white tablecloth
admiring with amusement the sign pap-
pa ravelli had hoisted on the wall-
i am an american citizen the hell with
mussolini-when a girl came in she
walked across to his table and ex-
claimed tim you old darling you
didnt wait for me

  tim coffins first inclination was to
say on your way lady youve got
the wrong guy but he always stifled
first inclinations because he was a good
detective ten years on the larceny
squad two on the bomb squad and
four in the narcotic division as a cap-
tain had mellowed tim coffin into the
kind of cop a city cries for

  he noticed instantly before he even
saw her face that her hands were shak-
ing even though she tried to clench her
hand bag to stop them she was fairly
well-dressed and her voice was pleasant
enough and when he saw her face he
was quite taken with her she was a
nice-looking girl her features refined
her mouth rather sad he could see in
the dark depths of her expressive eyes
that she was terrified even though she
smiled pleasantly at him

  her eyes begged him for recognition

her pale face lent her eyes a desperation

  tim coffin rose to his feet a faint
smile on his face when he spoke his
normally quiet voice was loud hello
kid he said i had to go ahead
couldnt wait for you have a seat   
pappa another order of spaghetti for
my friend

  si pappa ravelli waved i bring
it queek

  the girl sat down smiling and
scared tim sat down too and pulled at
his chin dont talk too loud he
cautioned two men came in after
you one of them is peke kane the
other i dont know the other is a
thin stringbean with fish eyes

  yes she said yes they followed
me

  whats your name

  kitty frane she said they want
to kill me you dont know what it
meant to find you here i just ran in
here because it was the closest place to
me and i had to get away from them
then i saw you-

  how did you know who i was
tim coffin said

  that white hair and the hooked
nose she said you have a nose like
sherlock holmes had ive always
thought so even when i saw your
picture in the papers i recognized you
in an instant im afraid to talk too long
im going to drop my bag and when you
pick it up youll see a baggage check
under the catch take it and keep it
until we can talk

che dropped her bag without another
word and tim coffin picked it up
scowling at the awkwardness of the
ruse he saw the stub and palmed it
and gave her back the bag

  you shouldnt have done that
coffin said evenly and i think youd
better spill while youre healthy you
sing a song of six slugs



wont get out of here without them
the peke and fish eyes are covering
this joint the peke has the front door
fish eyes disappeared back

  cant you get me out kitty frane
pleaded theyll kill me

  i can get you out coffin said
but i dont like making a fool of
myself whats it all about i dont
think youre kidding if you are youre
a damn good actress but then again
ive met damned good actresses in my
time and i have been taken before its
kind of coincidental that you should
have walked into this spot and recog-
nized me off the bat i admit im no
lily and id be easy to identify but
i dont go for this stuff about seeing
my pan in a newspaper

its the truth she said desperately
maybe it is said tim coffin all
i want to know is what is this baggage
check for and why do those two muggs
want you

  pappa ravelli brought the spaghetti
for the girl she made no attempt to
touch it pappa said tim theys a guy
in back he say he got to see you right
off

   with fish eyes 

  what kin eyes i dunno tim he
say he got to see you

  send him out coffin said and
tell him that one is old he handed
pappa ravelli a bill and stood up
maybe you were right kid he mur-
mured to the girl this place isnt
healthy any more when they try a stale
gag like that fish eyes wants to konk
me while the peke grabs you and makes
a break for it    theres dough tied
up in this and its big

  yes kitty frane breathed a lot
of money

  get up said coffin were leav-
ing walk by my side but dont take
my arm i want my hands free when

we get outside skip the first cab that
comes along and take the second one
and dont mind what i do if anything
happens run for centre street and ill
meet you there here we go

  the girl got up and followed tim
coffin across the room toward the door
the peke was sitting at the bar near
the door watching them in the mirror
he was a short man around thirty-five
and he got his nickname from the fact
that his face was bashed together as if
some sledge hammer had hit him on the
skull and upwards from his chin at the
same time

  when tim coffin was close enough
to the bar to see the peke more plainly
in the mirror he frowned the pekes
eyes were stary the pupils highly dilated
so that there was little of the irises
showing there was sweat on the pekes
sallow skin and the man was nervous
coke coffin thought plenty of it
and i dont mean cola

  kitty frane reached the door and
opened it tim coffin was behind her
the peke suddenly turned from the
bar after hastily putting down his
drink and then staggered headlong into
tim coffins legs as if he were drunk
tim went down it was as if he had
been blocked out by the interference of
a ball runner

   kitty frane screamed and ran up the
stairs to the street

   the peke tried to keep playing the
game by clinging to tims legs and
muttering thickly shorry ole boy
shorry as hell   

   coffin didnt waste time he clipped
the peke once behind the ear and when
the man screamed in pain coffin yanked
his legs away went to his knees solidly
punched the pekes jaw as the man tried
to rise quickly sober the force of the
punch drove the peke against the bar
rattling glasses on its top

  tim coffin stepped past leaped out
the door and went into the street
a cab was shooting up the street toward
the east side not the first cab that
had drawn up at the curb true to his
instructions the girl had managed to
run past it but the second cab was as
much of a death trap for the reason that
fish eyes had come around in front
after leaving by the back door and
had leaped into the cab with her

  there was just a glimpse of that face
with those expressionless eyes as the
second cab flashed by coffin stepped
into the first one where the driver re-
garded him with intermingled caution
and hostility follow that cab tim
said quietly

  sorry mac said the driver this
cab is taken

  this is the law coffin snapped
get into it

  sorry mac said the driver this
cab is taken and tim coffin made no
reply this time because the driver backed
it up with the muzzle of a belly gun it
was only a thirty-two and it looked like
a popgun without any length of barrel
but at that point-blank range it was
death

  the peke came up the steps when
he saw tim coffin he pulled out a colt
automatic that dwarfed the revolver in
the cab drivers hand he covered tim
who made no pass at his own gun tim
frowned

  peke said the driver you okay
yeah peke said this gumshoe
lammed me you shouldna done that
to me tim youre gonna be sorry
abeut that his mouth was twitching
and his eyes were blazing he was
terribly excited

  get in said the driver burn him
down and get in

  after him said the peke go on
timothy get in the crate or ill blow

your liver outa you right here you
shouldna made me mad timothy get
in the cab sid plug him if he passes
at me

im coffin got into the cab the
peke climbed in after him sid the
driver put the car in gear and hurried
toward the east side he said i dont
like this peke theres something
wrong here the chief didnt want no
run-in with the law

  shut up said the peke this guy
is poison youre new here you dont
know him just do like i say were
taking him to the boss

   all right sid said but its your
doing he was a little nervous and
keep that rod still and dont wave it
i dont want anymore fancy shooting
around here tonight get me youre
hopped up peke and i dont like to
work with a hoppy its too dangerous
im full of courage peke whis-
pered smiling hard ive got lots of it
i turned a gun on timothy coffin
there aint many guys have done that
sid watched him in the mirror and
whistled quietly

  tim coffin was uneasy he had never
felt real physical fear and he did not
feel it now it had always been easy for
tim coffin to act bravely because he had
never as far as he knew been afraid
only careful he didnt like guns he
carried one himself with reluctance but
he had seldom used it he had always
found that straight-forward action en-
forced by the fist was a more formid-
able weapon guns he felt were danger-
ous because they often killed the wrong
person

  he knew of course that the peke
had no intention of shooting him in the
cab if at all the peke was sounding
off because he was full of courage
the courage would wear off soon
sing a song of six slugs



enough and the peke would breathe in
horror at his own audacity but the gun
in pekes hand was cocked and peke
was excited his finger trembling

  there was too much chance of an
accident

  theres blood on the floor tim
coffin said his voice was quiet and con-
trolled and the words had a sepulchral
sound

  the peke looked down at the stain
and shuddered

  put your gun away coffin said
you can take mine just put your own
gun away im coming quietly

  sid looked in the mirror at him
youre a funny guy law

  i dont like guns tim said

  i dont either sid said youre a
sensible flatfoot take his rod away and
stop waving yours peke youll shoot
me in the neck before youre through
peke took coffins thirty-eight and
slipped it into his pocket then he slid
the hammer of his pistol forward ever
so gently and thrust the gun back into
the holster under his armpit he looked
down at the stain on the floor again
sid he called sid

  sid looked at him in the mirror
how is he asked the peke how
is al

  a is dead sid said al is dead
as a pickled herring  we had to dump
him in the street he should never have
started shooting it was his own fault
timothy coffin was no longer mysti-
fied he had been a detective long
enough to see the answers sid was the
man on the car peke fish eyes and
al had been the stickups there had
been a heist for a lot of money and al
had lost his head and started shooting
and the guy they had heisted was scared
into grabbing a gun so al was dead

  tim thought of the baggage check
he had no idea how the girl had got

it in the first place for it signified a
bag in hiding at pennsylvania station
and in the bag was the loot that was
the only answer to the whole thing

   sid turned a corner and began to cut
his speed so that a traffic cop at york
and th would not slow him or tag
him

  tim coffin decided to get off the
wagon he did not want to particularly
he wanted to play along and let these
ginzos take him to their headquarters
to meet the boss and then rope the
bunch such a task had its difficulties
but tim coffin never bothered with
such details until their solution became
imperative and then he had always
found that lightning action when none
was expected sufficed

  but he had to get off there was no
good sense in taking a chance on that
bag later on he would learn where
the stickup had taken place right now
the bag was valuable in it was a loot
that had caused one death could cause
two more-his own and kitty franes
the men were in deadly earnest it
meant the stakes were high   

jlm reached over suddenly and
slapped the peke across the face

  the peke almost cried in astonish-
ment his face went white and he
stayed frozen for a moment tim was
afraid the peke might get scared so
he slapped him again harder to make
him furious

  it worked the peke reached for the
automatic he had lately put away turn-
ing the back of his hand toward coffin
as he did so tim leaned forward slowly
and placed both his thumbs against the
back of that hand and went to work
he pressed home the hand curved in
against its own wrist and the peke
could not even scream at the intense
agony of the action


detective fiction weekly

  tim coffin then held his left thumb
in position and gently took the forty-
five from the holster he turned it in
his lap grabbed it by the barrel and
arched it down in a short hard throw
it hit the peke high above the right
eye he grunted uh and then sat
back in the seat out

  sid said tim coffin

  sid glanced in the mirror tim held
up the gun for him to see it they were
going down york and sid instantly
stepped up on the gas and the cab began
to roll

  tim coffin pressed the barrel against
sids head sid he said stop and
pull up at the curb

  you wont shoot me brother sid
said im at the wheel and this car is
traveling youll kill yourself if you
shoot me

  last chance said coffin quietly
pull up and stop or ill put one in
your skull

  you cant bluff this detroit boy
copper not this boy

  the speedometer read forty coffin
shot him through the head

  sid fell forward onto the floor the
speedometer dropped to thirty coffin
reached through the opening between
the front and back seats and caught the
wheel and held it there was no traffic
he did not need the brake when the
needle finally hung down at fifteen en
route to ten miles an hour tim let go
the wheel opened the door and climbed
out on the running board at ten miles
an hour he waited for a stone wall
found one and turned the car into it
it did not make much of a noise when
it hit and only bashed the front right
fender

  nobody seemed to see it tim coffin
crossed the street and went down the
block he turned toward fifth and
found a patrolman officer he said

theres been an accident on york car
just ran into a wall im going to call
for a doctor

  tell im to hurry said the patrol-
man ill be waiting at the scene

  so when he went crosstown in a red
bus timothy coffin felt much more at
ease the patrolman would have the
peke in charge suspecting him of the
death of sid it was a temporary
measure but tim could not waste time
explaining what had happened to patrol-
men waiting for homicide squad cars
and generally being delayed

  from fifth tim coffin switched to
a cab and went down to pennsylvania
station

  the peke he was thinking will prob-
ably talk all they had to do was isolate
him from coke for three days and he
would talk his head off tim coffin
guessed that he knew the mind behind
the heist already sid was new to him
fish eyes was new to him but the peke
and a hood named a fern worked for
the dude mr benny swink

  mr benny swink was not as funny
as his name he was not in fact funny
at all

  you would not have picked a fight
with him there were plenty of cops
who were afraid of him there were
broadway columnists who did not dare
mention his name jocularly under
threat of death there was talk of a
punk who had once coined an un-
fortunate rhyme using the name swink
and there were only rumors as to his
fate the best being that he had not
been wet at all when dumped in the east
river for he had an overcoat of cement

  benny swink was large swarthy and
sinister he was sinister because he
understood only one law force he was
not bright he did not talk smartly he
seldom opened his mouth he could not
think well but he could act
sing a song of six slugs



  and that is why he was afraid of
timothy coffin

  benny swink never admitted that he
was afraid of anyone but they all knew
that tim coffin was the nemesis no
one knew the real story behind it either
for there had been no witnesses and
coffin had never talked about it but
it appeared that swink unwittingly
had made a pass at a young girl singer
in a broadway musical whose name was
jane hope the hope had been ficti-
tious because coffin is not a good name
for a musical comedy but she had in
fact been tims own daughter she
told him

  the next night when benny swink
arrived in the lobby for the show tim
coffin met him and advised him to
skip it

   you pass that ticket taker benny
hed said quietly and i wont be re-
sponsible for your doctor bills

  benny knew coffin and knew his
reputation but there were three hoods
with him and he felt anyhow that he
was pretty hot stuff he passed the
ticket taker and he did not get out of
the hospital for three weeks they called
a riot squad on that one and those who
saw it admitted that coffin had stopped
just short of murder and all with his
fists those three hoods never remem-
bered they had guns and if they did
they never had the strength to pull
them nobody could locate them ten
minutes later

  mr benny swink never saw that
show or that girl again

           tim thought a little tired it
was benny swink he rubbed his
knuckles and smiled grimly remember-
ing the past he was nearly fifty when
that swink episode had happened he
was past fifty now but you could see
that he was still young in heart

  he went up the steps and into penn-
sylvania station liking its vastness and
feeling alone in the crowd his back
did not crawl there was no gnawing-
thought in his mind to turn and meet
eyes which watched his back he was
alone tim coffin knew it he hummed
a tune certain of it as he crossed the
main waiting room toward the baggage
check department

  he couldnt help thinking how odd it
was not in all his years had violence
ever stirred out of the spaghetti of pap-
pa ravelli there i was he would
tell jane his daughter sitting and
eating enough spaghetti to shame a
normal man when in walked this
dame 

  he went to the baggage check sill and
stood there for a moment no one
watched him and yet for the first time
tim coffin felt eyes on him you
cannot be a detective for that many
years and not feel eyes

  he hastily handed the check to the
man there was a fee to pay which he
instantly paid the bag he accepted was
small and black and fairly heavy he
could feel movement within it as if it
held packages he knew at once it did
not contain money

  tim coffin turned from the baggage
department and went over to the phone
booths he stepped inside dropped a
nickel in the slot put the bag on the
floor between his legs and dialed centre
street

  radio  said a voice

  mccarthy this is tim coffin i
want a radio car at pennsy station
right away two minutes flat im in
a phone booth by the baggage check
department near the main waiting room
and i m being followed ive got some-
thing hot and i need help

  right tim on the ball

  tim coffin hung up from the glass


detective fiction weekly

panel of the booth he saw a woman
running toward him he stared at her
hard it was kitty frane

  this was it this was the pay-off
he had no intention of dying in a
telephone booth where every bullet
would take its toll even blindly he
threw open the door and stepped out
carrying the bag

  coffin she cried coffin
yeah tim coffin said hello
kitty to tell you the truth i never
expected to see you alive again life
is full of surprises but he did not
watch her at all his eyes flickering
around at the passing people

  she was almost sobbing with excite-
ment she was out of breath they let
me go she said benny swink and
that fish-eyed man he called vitorio
they let me go i talked them out of it
they were going to kill me

  oh hell tim coffin grunted
youre a babe in the woods and you
came right here

  i told them i didnt know anything
about it and they let me go and then
i came here to find you ive been wait-
ing for you to pick up the bag

  so i see tim coffin said and
what do you think benny swink and
vitorio have been doing all this time
why do you think they let you go
theyve followed you here-that was
the point they wanted you to lead them
to the bag   

  kitty frane shook her head no
really no one followed me im sure
they didnt i was so careful    ive
got to tell you what happened

  stickups tim coffin said and
with benny swink at the helm it was
probably narcotics in this bag

  they held up the wholesale division
of a big drug firm she cried i was
going by on the street when they ran
out i jumped into a cab to get out of the

way and some one named al who was
carrying the bag threw it in my cab
and tried to get in but he was shot and
he fell in the street

  i told my driver to drive off quickly
these other men put al in a cab that
seemed to be waiting and they chased
me i saw them dump him out as we
went along so i knew he was dead i
lost them for a few seconds on th and
ran to pennsylvania station but they
must have found my cab driver and
asked him where i went they picked
me up coming out  the other side of
the station and followed me and i
managed to reach pappa ravellis and
found you there by luck

  no said tim coffin

  she stared at him what do you
mean  her face was bloodless and she
was gripping her purse

  just no said tim coffin thats
a good story but its too good ive got
white hair kitty and im getting old-
but my brain hasnt softened yet and i
can still manage a good thought now
and then

  have you gone crazy kitty said
lets get out of here lets get that
bag out of here its full of dope

  i know it is said tim coffin
theres a hundred thousand dollars
worth of dope in that bag she cried
i opened it and saw it i know there
is its worth all of that you dont
understand the war has stopped the
ships from reaching new york and
dope smuggling is at a standstill the
prices of snow have sky-rocketed and
the addicts will do or pay anything for
the stuff theyre going crazy

  did you say your name was kitty
frane or kitty fern

jitty could not get any more pallid

she was white as a ghost already
but her eyes were beginning to pop with
sing a song of six slugs



excitement and she was shaking as if
a fit would grasp her

  for instance said tim coffin a
girl named kitty fern happened to be
married to a guy named a fern who
happened to be a first class hood with
the benny swink mob

  all right she gasped youre
right a was my husband but hes
dead you dont understand they
double-crossed him i didnt have any-
thing to do with it i just went there
to make sure he was all right  

  tim coffins eyes stopped searching
the corridors outside they had found a
mark they had seen the face of benny
swink behind the edge of a newspaper
where a big man was sitting on a bench
waiting everybody was waiting even
tim coffin realized that he was waiting
kitty he said youre washed up
kitty stopped trembling and sighed
you and a pulled this one between
you tim said you and a were
going to double-cross the field a was
going to toss the bag of stuff in the
wrong cab by mistake and you were
going to lam with it and then the two of
you would get the pay-off and cut the
nose of benny swink and his gang
you couldnt know    she whis-
pered no one knew  no one even
knew we were married benny never
even saw me before 

  tim coffin smiled sometimes a
man can guess kitty and you just
substantiated my guess you were a
little too shaken you still are shaken
but not only from the excitement you
saw your husband killed before your
eyes thats why youre shot kitty
youre all gone inside

  she dabbed into her purse as if to
pluck a handkerchief from it but
instead she brought out a gun tim
coffin grunted and swung on her wrist
but there was a shot

   she didnt fire it it came from the
corridor the bullet hit her with terrible
force and knocked her away from tim
coffin she hit the marble floor hard
the thud was unpleasant

   tim coffin had pulled out the forty-
five for he himself was in range and that
seemed to be the idea benny swink
had not gunned the girl it was fish
eyes standing at the line of the booths
searching for a bead on tim coffin
but tim coffin had leaped for cover
into the narrow alley between the
booths still carrying the bag fish eyes
started to run and his gun spoke the
bullets crashed through the intervening
booths as if they were paper a man in
one of the booths was shot in the leg
and yelled bloody murder tim coffin
fired one bullet into fish eyes head
scarcely aiming he was a little sur-
prised at his own good shooting for
the colt automatic a big gun was not
familiar to him he was used to his own
thirty-eight which he had left in his
hurry in the cab on the peke

im coffin ran past the booth and
stepped over fish eyes on the way
he carried the bag in his left hand and
the gun in his right he made no at-
tempt to reach an exit instead he
headed for the bulk of benny swink
behind the newspaper here he made a
mistake

  what the hell he thought as he saw
the mistake a man cant see everything
at a time like this

  benny had plugged a hole through
the center fold of the newspaper figur-
ing it safer to peer through the aperture
rather than risk his face around the
edge he saw tim coffin coming for
him when tim had wanted to surprise
him

  and as tim moved forward he saw
the black muzzle of a gun fill up the


detective fiction weekly

aperture then stab a brief ragged flame
at him

   it felt as if a horse had kicked him
high in the chest and he knew his
collar bone on the right side was
smashed by the slug

  his right arm went useless his
fingers did not even have the strength
to hold onto the pistol but even if
they had had his arm would never have
been able to raise the gun for a shot
his wrist muscles had turned into cold
water

  tim had halted momentarily twisted
by the impact of the bullet but he did
not go down

  he stood still dazed he had been
shot before but never at this close
range and the terrific impact of the
slug took his breath away there was
no pain yet only a lifelessness as if his
whole right side had gone to sleep

  he dropped the bag and sprang at
benny swink ducking to the left and
kicking up with his left foot when he
got within range he broke through the
paper and caught benny swinks wrist
with the point of his shoe so that
bennys second shot ricocheted off the
ceiling

   the gun went sailing through the air
and benny swink leaped to his feet
yelling with pain his right wrist hung
brokenly and he had grabbed it with his
free hand

  hello benny tim coffin said
your right hand gone too

  benny swink got the import and
stopped yelling there was no place to



back away his piggish eyes filled with
terror he recalled the past

  that boils it down to left hooks
said tim coffin through his teeth as he
hunched over slightly as the pain crept
in he moved forward lithely and went
to work it was something to see when
a couple of intelligent men finally
separated the two of them and the
police from a radio car arrived benny
swink had forgotten about his wrist
entirely there were those who won-
dered if mr swink would ever see out
of that right eye again for unfortunate-
ly tim coffin had a ring on his left
hand which his nerveless right hand did
not have the strength to turn under as
a gentleman fighter would have done
but that was mr swinks own fault

  so some two hours later as he was
getting sleepy from the shot of mor-
phine they had given him at the hospital
after they extracted the bullet set the
collar bone and bandaged him up
tightly in gauze and plaster timothy
coffin gazed upon the face of his wor-
ried daughter who patted his cheek
fondly and somewhat sadly she was
crying a little

  dad dad how did you ever get in
this terrible mess

  tim coffin sighed it was just as he

another fascinating case by peter paige for
youre the jury
the talking clock

by frank gniber

a dfw
feature serial
part v

the gunman covered me and bos
said you are getting tough mr
fletcher

oince the night before tom quisen-
berrys strange death when he had in-
trusted johnny fletcher and sam cragg
with a pawn ticket the talking clock had
been constantly on their minds others
shared their interest especially since the
collector nicholas bos made a cash offer
of  for it actually the clock be-
longed to diana rusk the daughter of
ellen rusk because of her secret mar-
riage to tom just before his death but there
were plenty of people who could have used
that clock among them were eric quis-
enberry toms father who was within an
inch of being strapped and his wife
bonita who apparently valued money be-
yond most other things in life bonitas ex-
husband jim partridge a private detective
also was in on the play and so was their
daughter vivian dalton a singer

  it was at a night club that the latest
bombshell of the case burst in on johnny
and sam lieutenant madigan of the
homicide squad informed them that joe

cornises the quisenberry estate manager
had been murdered johnny got the chief
of police of hillcrest on the phone

did cornish have a strip of plaster on
his face he asked

yes the cop replied and there wasnt
anything under it-not even a scratch-
which is funny because he was supposed to
have been beaten up the night before by rob-
bers who stole the talking clock

johnny thought it funny too

xxii

the sun shining on his face woke
johnny fletcher in the morning
he lay for a moment looking at
the two mounds on the bed beyond then
he whistled and sat up

up boys its morning

he sprang out of bed and headed for

the bathroom when he came out later
shaved and whistling sam cragg and
mort murray were partially dressed

  its after eight johnny mort re-
minded think you ought to call that
bellboy 

  righto johnny went to the phone
and got eddie miller and asked him to
come up when the bell captain came
into the room he looked cynically at
mort murray

  ringing in an extra sleeper mr
fletcher peabody aint going to like
that

  lots of things peabody doesnt like
eddie my boy this is a pal of mine
and hes in a jam unless i can uh lend
him twenty bucks this morning things
are going to happen to him so ed-
die

  gee mr fletcher i had to borrow
carfare this morning you know what
i got in a kelly pool game with a cquple
sharks last night and they cleaned me
mort murray groaned and the light
went out of johnnys eyes eddie he
said sadly you disappoint me if you
must play kelly pool why dont you
play it with sam here some time he
was the three-cushion champ of bremer
county iowa once well when do you
think you can get twenty bucks 

  not before night and maybe not
then if things is slow today you know
mr fletcher id give it to you if i had
it the shirt off of my back

  that goes for me too eddie

  eddie moved regretfully to the door
there he paused say mr- fletcher
howd you and sam get the new suits
if you was broke

  johnny waggled a finger at the bell-
boy thats a secret eddie a secret i
hope no onell ever know

  eddie nodded but speculation
gleamed in his eyes as he went out
there was a film of perspiration on

morts face geez i cant go to the
office carmellall be waitin there for
me

  samll go with you in fact ill go
myself mort old boy

  the door panels almost cracked under
the pounding of a heavy fist then the
door was flung open and lieutenant
madigan strode in

  did i wake you up

  if id been dead youd woke me
up retorted johnny then his face
twisted into a grin but youre wel-
come as the flowers in may look
lieutenant this is mort murray as fine
a lad as youd find anywhere in this big
city hes a book publisher in fact he
publishes that little gem every man a
samson with which ive been making a
living such as it be for the last ten
years and now hes in dutch he got
into the clutches of a loan shark

   s tough sympathized madigan
whats his name

  carmella genualdi replied mort
  carmella ah that means nick
  nick who johnny asked

  nick bosapopolous or something
he calls himself nick bos for short
nick bos did you say johnny
howled

  yeah he controls half the loan
shark business in this burg everybody
knows that for all the good it does
us   

  nick bos the sponge man down on
west avenue

  lieutenant madigan shrugged i
guess hes got a sponge business or
something as a blind

  holy donald duck cried sam
cragg

johnny sat down heavily on his bed
so thats how he can afford seventy-
five thousand dollars for a clock
huh said lieutenant madigan
didnt the partridges question him
the talking clock



when you questioned them hell bos
is knee-deep in the quisenberry busi-
ness

  lieutenant madigan turned red in
the face they didnt say a word about
him they didnt say much of anything
partridge stuck to his alibi and the
quisenberry dame kept hollering for a
lawyer i finally turned them loose
now you talk fletcher hows bos in
this 

  lets said johnny go down and
talk to him right now

  suits me we can have a chin on the
way down i got the limousine out
front

cam and mort finished dressing and
 then they all left the room in the
lobby mr peabody was running his
fingers over the seams of the furniture
to see if the cleaners had missed any
dust he exclaimed when he saw lieu-
tenant madigan

  i knew it fletcher youre in trou-
ble again

  you hope peabody this isnt a
pinch and ill thank you not to make
slanderous remarks in hotel lobbies
johnny headed for the door mutter-
ing to himself only two days to the
first will he be surprised

  detective fox sat behind the wheel
of the limousine he knew johnny and
sam from other days but did not greet
them with any great enthusiasm mort
climbed in beside detective fox and
the others got in back

  madigan gave fox the address of
bos office as the car headed westward
toward the express highway he said
my friend merryman in hillcrest
called me this morning some bird
claiming to be from the department
called him last night    right after
you left the lucky seven whats the
angle fletcher

  joe cornish claimed he had a fight
the night before with some burglars-
when the talking clock was swiped
when i saw him yesterday he had some
adhesive tape stuck on his face merry-
man said it was a dummy catch on
yeah cornish didnt fight with
burglars so he swiped the clock him-
self

 id figured bonita for it at first
she wanted to sell it to bos for seventy-
five gs on account of old simple
simon died broke and didnt leave her
husband any dough

  why should she swipe the clock
when her husband was getting it any-

       njj

way

  thats it he wasnt the clock went
to the rusk kid it seems the old man
had given it outright to his grandson
tom quisenberry who was killed up
in-i mean who died before the old
man the kid was married to diana
so the clock belongs to her

  why dont people tell me these
things exclaimed madigan

  why dont you ask around like
me  so since im asking how was this
cornish killed

  the popular way a bullet a thirty-
two right behind the ear

  a small gun grunted johnny
and behind the ear mmm

  it could be the dame well i got
a couple of men on her shes checked
in at the sorenson

  partridge lives there himself

  i know but theyre on different
floors i got a couple of men on par-
tridge too and    uh merrymans
talking to the girl out in hillcrest
which reminds me that was a dirty
trick of yours letting her slip by me
last night i got the fella though 
tamarack

  where

  oh i was laying for him when he


detective fiction weekly

got to his apartment on east th
thats how come i didnt get around to
you he didnt show up until two am
drove the girl all the way out to hill-
crest what do you make of tama-
rack 

  johnny shrugged hes got a crush
on the girl with the kid out of the
way he may win out now

  he told me hes practically run the
clock factory the last two years but
eric gave him his notice yesterday
eric ill be damned the mouse
has become a tomcat first he told off
his wife then he fired his old mans
pet looks like hes going to take hold
of things

  detective fox said over his shoul-
der here we are lieutenant but-
gee you know what place this is

  i know fox stop the car behind
the big cadillac

  fox obeyed and they climbed out of
the limousine johnny walked forward
to the cadillac and looked at the mono-
gram on the door nb he com-
mented

  so whats it to you snapped the
heavy-jowled man sitting behind the
wheel

t ieutenant madigan looked
 at detective fox and jerked his
head in the direction of the tough chauf-
feur as detective fox walked forward
madigan and the others entered the
office of the sponge company

  the receptionist regarded the group
uneasily her hands fluttered and went
under her desk

  go ahead grunted madigan give
him the signal well just breeze in
they did and when they entered
nicholas bos office the sponge man
was leaning back comfortably in his
upholstered chair

  good morning lieutenant madi-

gan he said pleasantly and my
friends the private detectives you have
find the clock for me

  well talk about that in a minute
bos said johnny heading off the de-
tective theres another little matter
i want to clear up you got a punk
named carmella working for you 
carmella i dont knowing the
name

  hes one of your collectors he
made a small loan to my pal here and
hes been bothering him since

cut in one of your strong-arm punks
a sad look came over bos face
mr lieutenant you thinking to that

ney he say nothing because he can
prove nothing i am sponge importer
thats all i make a leetle money and i
buy the clock for hobby because i am
liking clock very much thats all i

ominously dont i know youve got
friends in the right places but theres

them   

  wait a minute snapped johnny
one thing at a time morts getting
cold chills by the minute thinking
about that punk carmella look bos
mort murray borrowed a hundred and
twenty bucks from carmella i want

the dough out of my retainer mem-
ber

  bos shrugged expressively all

murder business
the talking clock



johnny tapped mort on the arm
okay pal you can run along now
youre squared off ill see you later
sighing heavily mort took his de-
parture

  then johnny turned again to nicho-
las bos youve read the morning
papers    and you know about joe
cornish

  is sad why somebody killing
watchman 

  i was going to ask that snapped
lieutenant madigan i understand
youre in this up to your neck youve
made a fancy offer for a certain talk-
ing clock

  sure i telling you i like clock and
this is very good old clock i want-
ing have him for my hobby i also
buying many other clock bos waved
a manicured hand around his office
to indicate the clocks

  this isnt getting us anywhere
said madigan angrily if you wont
talk here bos well go down to head-
quarters

  sure you got warrant im think-
ing all this happen in westchester
county

  im working with the westchester
police and i can get a warrant easily
enough you know i can where were
you yesterday afternoon bos 

  right here in my office i am work-
ing   

  madigans forehead creased i was
a chump to even ask that question you
wouldnt soil your hands anyway and
youve got so many thugs working for
you itd take me a month to round them
all up ill start over    why do you
want this particular talking clock
ill ask a question johnny
fletcher cut in he leaned forward
what does the talking clock say at
three oclock

that was the first time johnny saw

any emotion on nicholas bos face
the olive complexion of the importer
loan-shark actually became two shades
lighter

  i-i dont knowing what she say
he stammered

  johnny nodded quietly and half
turned to the door guess were wast-
ing our time lieutenant

  madigan backed away reluctantly
he sighed wearily okay ill be see-
ing you later bos

utside the chauffeur of the
cadillac was dabbing a handker-
chief at his nose detective fox was
leaning against the police limousine
rubbing the knuckles of his right fist

  madigan headed for the car but
johnny held back guess ill be leav-
ing you here lieutenant

  what for

  i still have to make a living you
know thought id go and sell a few
books

youve got something up your
sleeve its about that clock i saw bos
face when you asked him what the
clock said at three oclock 
the police radio in the limousine
barked suddenly lieutenant madigan
call in lieutenant madigan call in
madigan opened the door of the
limousine and reaching in flicked a
switch madigan talking what is it
merryman of hillcrest telephoned
replied the radio voice the talking
clock has been returned

  what exclaimed madigan then
he switched off the radio and pulled out
of the car okay fletcher run
along

  johnny fletcher scowled then sig-
naled to sam cragg they walked lei-
surely to the corner then rounding
it johnny broke into a run for a cigar
store across the street when sam


detective fiction weekly

caught up to him johnny was already
inside a telephone booth stuffing
nickels into the slot

  a moment later he was speaking
to a servant in the quisenberry home
i want to talk to eric quisenberry
tell him its johnny fletcher calling
it was a long moment before eric
quisenberrys voice came over the
telephone yes mr fletcher

  i just learned from the new york
police that the talking clock has been
returned how was it returned mr
quisenberry 

  why thats the surprising thing
mr fletcher i dont know it most
certainly was gone yesterday    from
the safe but this morning when i went
into the clock room there it was stand-
ing amidst all the other clocks i noti-
fied the police immediately they-well
theyre here now

  oh johnny bit his lip then
mr quisenberry do you plan on
going down to your office today
why yes in fact im going to
leave as soon as i finish with the po-
lice

  good ill drop in at your office
sometime during the afternoon i think
ill have something important to tell
you at the time

  what i mean why are you tak-
ing such an interest in this youre
not-

  im an old friend of toms thats
why ill see you later mr quisen-
berry

  he hung up abruptly as they left
the store sam cragg groused thats
screwy-the crook returning the clock
after killing a man for it

  youre telling me sam its not
only screwy its impossible i dont be-
lieve it unless  the clock was never
swiped at all

  huh you think quisenberrys the

guy say-why couldnt he be

  he could erics gotten a grip on
himself he tossed out his wife yester-
day and gave the grand bounce to the
tamarack lad at the factory two
things he never had nerve enough to
do before i wonder  if the clock
stealing stuff wasnt just some business
to bring things to a head with bonita
ive underestimated the guy

  hes been sweet on the rusk kids
mother she looks like a dame whos
got some steel in her backbone
maybe she stuck a ramrod down
his back still    taxi

  taxis again exclaimed sam
with the bankroll the way she is 
theres more where this came from
driver take us to lexington and
sixtieth

xxiii

wenty minutes later johnny
paid the cabby a dollar and forty
cents to sam craggs disgust

  whats up here thats worth a buck-
forty he griped

  the clock shop across the street
you wait here im going in alone
johnny crossed the street and en-
tered the antique clock dealers shop
the proprietor exclaimed when he rec-
ognized johnny

  you have come back eh what do
you want today

  why i thought id get some addi-
tional information on clocks for that
article you know

  what article what newspaper
yesterday after you left i thought
about something interesting to tell you
for that story and i called the blade
you know what they told me
johnny grimaced that i wasnt
working for them okay ill come clean
im a detective working on the quisen-
berry case
the talking clock



  why didnt you say so yesterday
the other man did

  what other man

  the detective who was here in the
afternoon he didnt give his name
whatd he look like

  the clock dealer shrugged how
does a detective look he didnt wear
a uniform

  whatd he want to know
dont you know aint he from
your office

  therere a half dozen of us work-
ing on the case it was probably snod-
grass who was here look you told
me yesterday youd seen this clock on
exhibition i suppose you heard it talk
too

  of course it wasnt a very good
oice too tinny

  ive heard it once im interested in
knowing what the clock said not how
it said it would you remember any
of the things it said at the different
hours  three oclock for example 
the clock dealer screwed up his face
i dont remember anything particular
i heard it talk several different times
it wasnt anything unusual platitudes
johnny sighed maybe i can re-
fresh your memory at five oclock the
little man comes out and says five
oclock and the day is nearly done
yes thats the kind of stuff it says
right after that at six oclock it says
something about when day is done and
night begins to fall 

  and at three oclock johnny
leaned forward eagerly try and re-
member that hour will you

  i cant i never paid any particular
attention    but   

  yes

  the dealer snapped his fingers i
may have it here yes i remember
now the convention special reported it
the last time simon exhibited the clock

two years ago ive got the magazines
around here 

  he headed for the back of the room
and opened a closet yes here they
are copies of the american hobbyist
for the last two years

  johnny flanked the counter can i
help you look 

  yes lets see the convention two
years ago was in summer july i think
the report would be in the august
issue look for august 

  the dealer scooped out a stack of
the magazines and they began to rum-
mage through them it was johnny
who found the august  issue
here it is

hey spread the magazine out on
the counter their eager fingers
turning the pages

  clock exhibit read the dealer
here it is yes simon quisenberrys
talking clock at twelve oclock it
says twelve oclock high noon and
midnight rest ye weary- 

  three oclock exclaimed johnny
then he began to read  three oclock
theres a divinity that shapes our ends
rough hew them as we may 

  johnny exclaimed in consternation
shakespeare i remember now
the dealer said

  but its meaningless johnny cried
most of it is i told you it didnt
say anything important

  johnny groaned his eyes fell once
more to the page and then he ex-
claimed again look-five oclock i
am the master of my fate i am the cap-
tain of my soul 

  henley the clock dealer prompted
mmm i didnt have six oclock quite
right it says when night falls and
the morning comes  

  this is wrong johnny said the
dock doesnt say that at five oclock


detective fiction weekly

how do you know it doesnt
because i heard it it said five
oclock and the day is nearly done 
you made a mistake i heard the
clock several times and i couldnt re-
member exactly

  but i do remember theres no
mistake when i heard that clock talk
a week ago it said five oclock and
the day is nearly done i remember
the clock dealer shrugged so
whats the difference maybe simon
had a couple of talking discs each
different the detective who was here
yesterday asked about that

  just what did he ask

  if it was possible to change the
talking records in the clock i told him
yes although itd be pretty hard to
get the records made they were metal
discs made of a gold alloy if i re-
member right the detective asked if
i could make such a disc and i told
him no

  and then

  i suggested he try some of the
phonograph recording places

  johnny straightened look sir
you have no use for this old magazine
how about loaning it to me

  you can have it on one condition
that you tell me the inside story of
the talking clock when the case is all
settled

  thats a deal mister

  johnny rolled up the magazine
thanked the clock dealer for his help
and left the store heading across the
street sam cragg came to meet him

  dont look now johnny but in the
doorway of the cigar store behind me
-to the right-theres a bird been fol-
lowing us

  following johnny despite sams
caution shot a look at the cigar store

  a man stepped out johnny cried
old timer

  old timer  sam blinked

  the tramp from minnesota come
on

  it was the tramp no question about
that he was as ragged and filthy as
ever and like in minnesota he sud-
denly took to his heels with amazing
swiftness when he saw johnny and
sam descending upon him

  he reached the nearby corner of
sixieth street sixty feet ahead of them
and when they rounded it he had
increased the distance to eighty or
ninety feet

  hell johnny panted hes get-
ting away again  

  he looked wildly over his shoulder
for a taxi but none was in sight he
gritted his teeth and put everything
he had into running but it was no
use

  old timer reached third avenue
a hundred and twenty feet ahead of
them he turned south and when
johnny reached the corner he had dis-
appeared

tohnny stopped and waited for
 sam cragg to catch up hes gone
again he said disgustedly we ought
to be ashamed of ourselves an old guy
   hell

  he must be an olympic champion
the way he ran puffed sam

  weve solved one thing though
old timer did kill the kid up in min-
nesota its no coincidence that hes here
in new york but    how  the devil
did he pick us up this morning
the hotel he probably followed us
all the way to bos

  but only a few people know where
were staying in new york lets see
aside from madigan theres partridge
eric quisenberry the rusks and wil-
bur tamarack probably

  what about the greek
the talking clock



  could be mort could have been
followed- by carmella or one of bos
other gorillas that applies to par-
tridge too any employee of his would
know where we lived and we dont
know them by sight mmm could be
one of partridges men went up to
minnesota to throw in with the kid
damn it all anyway ive a good notion
to chuck the whole thing

  swell said sam cragg im all
for that lets get back to work and
earn a few bucks the season will be
opening in florida soon and id like to
go there this winter

  johnny shrugged gloomily who
wouldnt

   its a deal then

  maybe johnny took a nickel from
his pocket and tossed it into the air
he caught it expertly guess ill make
a phone call

  sam cragg groaned but i thought
you just said-

  it isnt winter yet florida wont
run away he went into a drugstore
leaving sam outside looking up the
number of the quisenberry clock com-
pany he went into a booth and dialed

  has mr eric quisenberry got into
the office yet he asked the operator

  he has but hes unable to come to
the phone at present some important
matters in the plant   

  all right then let me talk to mr
wilbur tamarack

  im sorry was the reply but mr
tamarack is no longer with us
what do you mean exclaimed
johnny mr tamaracks your sales
manager isnt he

  he was he severed his connections
with this firm yesterday

  johnny pretended astonishment
well can you give me his home ad-
dress  its important that i get in touch
with him

  just a moment yes here it is he
lives at the chanticleer on east fifty-
seventh street

  thanks snapped johnny banging
the receiver on the hook he glowered
at the phone thats loyalty for you
how did she know i wasnt a process
server looking for him they ought
to know better than to give out a mans
home address

  he left the drugstore and picked up
sam just for the fun of it lets run
over and talk to tamarack he lives
nearby hell be plenty sore at quisen-
berry and may give us the real dirt
on him that we mightnt be able to get
at any other time

  lead on sighed sam who am
i to make any protest im only your
stooge you know

  johnny grinned feeling sorry for
yourself

  they walked briskly to the chanti-
cleer johnny was impressed when he
saw it they must have paid this guy
a good salary either that or he was
tapping the till

  a doorman opened the door for them
and in the richly furnished lobby a
uniformed attendant took their names
and telephoned tamaracks apartment

  mr tamarack will see you suite


qn the eleventh floor tamarack
had the door of his apartment open
and nodded curtly to them who gave
you my address was the first thing
he asked

  your office i telephoned-

  they would well come in i was
just packing

they entered the apartment it was
furnished in even better taste than the
lobby downstairs nice diggings
johnny remarked you moving
why not ive lost my job i sup-


detective fiction weekly

pose they told you that at the office
too 

  they said youd severed your con-
nections

  severed hell quisenberry came
down and fired me without notice well
hell be sorry for that

  i imagine he will from what ive
heard he doesnt know much about the
business

  tamarack looked sharply at johnny
hes going to learn    quick
johnny looked inquiringly at tama-
rack but the latter did not amplify his
comment instead he went to a liquor
cabinet and opened it drink

  yeah sure said sam

  no thanks said johnny we
havent had breakfast yet

  you must have got out early
tamarack cleared his throat look
fletcher maybe ive had you all wrong
i was pretty sarcastic last night but
the kid-diana i mean-got to talk-
ing to me and she just about convinced
me

that i was just a nosey dope
tamarack almost grinned your
friend the detective talked to me too
oh madigan i solve his cases for
him whatd he talk to you about
usual things they ask suspects
where was i on the night of june
th

  johnny coughed where were you 
  the night of june th

  ill start all over when did eric
quisenberry leave for minnesota
the same day the sheriff of that
place telephoned i got the message at
the office and delivered it to him he left
inside of an hour he was gone three
days

  and you were in new york dur-
ing those three days

  tamarack laughed outright i
thought you were getting around to

that no fletcher i wasnt in new
york those three days i was in st
louis and kansas city and omaha
too i was gone five days altogether

  i see said johnny thoughtfully
do you it so happens that i was
the sales manager of the quisenberry
clock company in that capacity i
spent an average of ten days of every
month on the road calling on the big-
ger accounts

  well said johnny you cant
blame me for trying just one more
question how long did you work for
the clock company

  a bitter look crossed tamaracks
face fourteen years it was the only
job i ever had i went there right from
college

  i worked in a place once said
johnny the boss son came into the
place and worked his way up to be
vice-president in six months i havent
worked a day since

  tamarack almost grinned i heard
what you pulled in hillcrest the other
day dont you call that work

  sam does the work i just talk i
like to talk

  so ive gathered said tamarack
drily but if you dont mind ive
got a lot of packing to do it happens
that my month is up today and
since im now unemployed ive got to
move to a cheaper place

  the th street hotel is a cheap
place said johnny but if you go
there dont give my name as a refer-
ence theyd make you pay in advance
well be seeing you tamarack

jeaving the chanticleer johnny
and sam walked back to lexing-
ton avenue there they descended to
the subway and rode to grand central
and then shuttled across town to times
square coming up to the street they
the talking clock



went to their hotel where they had a
belated breakfast in the dining room

  finishing they went to their room
and johnny took the copy of the amer-
ican hobbyist from his pocket

  sam i want you to think carefully
when we were in that hock shop in
columbus-uncle joes place-and the
talking clock went off what did it
say

  sam rubbed his chin with the back
of his hand something about this is
five oclock and its the end of the
day

  well thats close enough it said
five oclock and the day is nearly
done now look heres an article in
this magazine about the clock with a
list of the things its supposed to say
at the different hours for five oclock
it recites a line of poetry i am the
master of my fate i am the captain
of my soul 

  i read that in a book once said
sam

  so did i now for three oclock it
says theres a divinity that shapes
our ends rough hew them as we may
is that statement worthy twenty-five
grand 

  huh

  it was three oclock the day before
yesterday when we were in the quisen-
berry shack remember  the clocks all
went off right after nick bos had of-
fered fifty thousand for the talking
clock when the noise started he put
his ear down to the clock and listened
then as soon as there was quiet he
raised his ante to seventy-five thou-
sand

  because of what he heard the clock
say cried sam

  johnny threw himself down on the
bed i wish i knew i wish i was a
cop too i could get the answers to a
lot of questions that i cant get now

  such as what

  well for one thing i could send
a dozen men around to all the phono-
graph recording places in the city and
find out who had a miniature record-
ing disc made of a gold alloy and
then i could find out a lot of things
about the quisenberrys jim partridge
has the edge on us there hes got five-
six operators working for him

  sam sniffed awhile ago you said
you felt like chucking the thing
how the hell can i quit i know
more about this business right now
than anyone else but i dont know
enough i dont know the murderers
name  or what the talking clock
said at three oclock the day before
yesterday

  nick bos knows that

  but nick like the daisies wont
tell

  for my money said sam hes
the guy who did it

  what swiped the clock and re-
turned it thatd be the same fellow
who killed cornish    and  no
he couldnt be old timer who was in
minnesota

  why not nicks in pretty good
physical shape he isnt as much of a
sissy as he lets on to be and hes got
that gang of monkeys working for
him

  it could be one of them or it
could be jim partridge or one of his
operators it could even be eric quisen-
berry the rusk girl beat him to minne-
sota by auto    but suppose he didnt
go by train but took a plane hed
been there in time to get tossed into the
clink before we were

  but he was the kids old man
johnny

  fathers have killed their sons and
vice versa for a lot less sometimes
than seventy-five grand for that mat-


detective fiction weekly

ter i dont even know if joe cornish
was away from the estate for a couple
of days last week i guess i could find
that out

  why dont you

  what for  cornish is dead now he
wouldnt make a good witness mmm
it could have been bonita who sent
cornish up to minnesota and then she
knocked him off yesterday because she
didnt want to split with him

  the telephone on the stand beside
johnny tinkled and he leaned over and
picked it up he said casually hello
and then stiffened

  a miss rusk to see you mr
fletcher said the voice of the operator
send her up

  he hung up the receiver and looked
at sam cragg a gleam in his eye the
rusk kid this may be interesting

xxiv

qiana rusk tapped on the door
a moment later and johnny let
her in her face was drawn and there
was a rather frightened look in her
eyes

she was carrying a large object
wrapped in brown wrapping paper and
tied with a stout cord it seemed heavy
she set the package on the dresser
how do you -do miss rusk
johnny said wont you have a seat
she shook her head i cant stay
i just stopped in to-to talk to you
first of all i want to thank you for
sparing me the embarrassment of being
questioned in public by the detective
johnny waved magnanimously and
waited for her to go on his eyes went
to the package it was just about large
enough to contain the talking clock

  her sharp white teeth worried her
lower lip then she took a deep breath

  its about mr quisenberry the
police-seem to suspect him of  

  of killing joe cornish thats
natural but they havent arrested him
and they wont  for awhile
n-no but they questioned him for
hours last night and again this morn-
ing mother is    worried

  i know he looked thoughtfully at
her it was apparent that she was hav-
ing a difficult time of it he focused his
eyes again on the package and then she
plunged

  mother is greatly impressed with
you she said you were the only one
to guess about-me and tom and
then she heard you the other day when
you were selling books she thinks
youre a wonderful salesman and since
we havent any money to help mr
quisenberry she thought 

  she turned to the package mr
quisenberry gave me the talking clock
he said it was mine and there was no
use holding it from me and we thought
mother and i that since that man mr
bos   

  ah you want to sell him the
clock johnnys lips twisted her ap-
proach was naive to say the least the
plea for sympathy first then flattery
you want me to sell the clock for
you

  she bobbed her head up and down
yes mr bos offered a very large
sum but were not sure he really meant
it it didnt seem possible

  johnny walked to the dresser the
clock is yours if you want to sell it
thats your business come ill go down
with you to see this mr bos you wait
here sam

  outside johnny hailed a taxicab
they were in it rolling southward be-
fore diana rusk finally came out with
it the clock doesnt    talk any
more

  johnny wasnt too surprised it had
been too much trouble for the thief to
the talking clock



have a new record made so hed re-
turned the clock without any record

  its broken diana went on i
mean its not really broken but that
voice disc is missing from it will it  
make much difference 

  oh no said johnny it wont
make any difference hardly any at all
he can buy a new disc for a dollar
what time is it ive got a watch but
its in a pawnshop in denver colo-
rado

  she looked at her wrist watch ten
minutes to twelve

  johnny called to the driver take it
easy we dont want to get there before
twelve

  he grinned at diana so hell have
to wait until one oclock to discover the
clock dont talk just as well hes
heard it talk before anyway

hey got to nicholas bos office
at two minutes after twelve im
back said johnny brightly to the girl
in the reception office i bring a gift
to a greek

  the quotation the girl said se-
verely is beware of greeks bringing
gifts ill see if mr bos is free

  he was and when his eyes took in
the big package they began to glow
what do you having here  he asked
eagerly

  johnny set the clock on bos desk
picked up a pair of shears and delib-
erately snipped the cord then he
peeled off the wrapping paper

  behold he said the talking
clock shes yours mr nicholas bos
the greatest treasure in the entire clock
collecting world all yours for a mere
seventy-five thousand dollars plus ten
thousand

  bos gave a start what you mean-
ing seventy-five tousand plus-how
much 

  plus ten thousand the little bonus
you said youd give me when i found
the clock remember  im knocking off
the three hundred thats really due yet
on our expense money

  you are crazy gasped the clock
collector you dont finding the clock
she is not lost

  hey protested sam cragg

  johnny smiled at the greek but
there was a glint in his eyes so
youre going to renege are you very
well  he reached for the wrapping
paper and began pulling it up over the
clock he took his time about it ex-
pecting that bos would stop him

  bos remained absolutely quiet
johnny got the pieces of cord together
knotted them into one piece

  sorry old man he said tightly
we were giving you first chance at it
weve got two other offers   
nicholas bos laughed softly how
much three thousand dollars five
ha-ha johnny laughed without
humor always the kidder arent you
i can get eighty thousand for this little
old clock any day any time

  in that case my friend i withdraw
you may sell to other party

  johnnys bluff almost collapsed but
he drew a deep breath and prepared
to play it a little farther he twisted the
cord about the package and then
diana rusk could stand it no longer
how much will you pay mr bos 
johnny groaned she had lost him
the game bos wanted that clock and
he would have paid for it he had to
pay

  i give you twenty-five thousand dol-
lar bos said

  the gold in its worth more
johnny said caustically

  you make joke bos said sharply

detective fiction weekly

the other day you talked about

  diana rusk started to open her
mouth and johnny roared

  bos pulled opened the drawer of his
desk and took out a check book johnny
leaned over make it out to cash then
let miss rusk endorse it and you okay

up the check and handed it to miss
rusk why dont you run over to the
bank with this miss rusk ive got an-
other matter i want to talk to mr bos

  she departed and nicholas bos shook
his head cynically you are too soft
mr fletcher you dont getting com-
mission and-you are poor bluffer
dont you know i would not have let
you walk out of here with that clock
i knew it but she didnt johnny
said now about that bonus

  the sponge man touched a button
under his desk a door at the side of
the office opened and in came carmella
genualdi the loan shark

  bos said carmella this is the man
who squawk to the police

  carmella took a gun out of his
pocket the wise guy eh i got a
good notion to  

  bos shook his head you were gel
ting tough mr fletcher

  no said johnny i was getting
out of here as soon as you made that
call to the bank

  i make hihi now bos picked up
the phone the bank miss dimitrios

tohnny waited only long enough to
 hear the conversation between the
bank manager and bos then he took
his departure he was glad to get away
bos might have become impatient and
pushed ahead the hands of the clock
to make it talk

  back at the th street hotel
johnny encountered vivian dalton
stepping into the elevator she had just
come from the beauty parlor and looked
like money from home

  hi johnny fletcher she greeted
him i was just going to stop in and
see you and your pal

  the latch strings always out to
you vivian hows your old man
jim hes ripping but then hes
always that way he and bonita arent
talking-again theyve always been
that way so everythings fine

  they reached the eighth floor and
johnny opened the door of room 
sam cragg bounced up from one of the
beds

  vivian he cried i was just think-
ing about you his grin stretched
from ear to ear

  i hope they were nice thoughts
sammy

  pardon me johnny said sarcas-
tically you were talking about your
parents vivian why arent you broken
up about the reconciliation falling
through

  reconciliation hell exclaimed
the talking clock



vivian mom had an angle and it
didnt work shes a gold-digger you
know pop used to slap her ears down
but shes gotten out of hand and he
cant do much with her these days its
okay by me

  johnny shook his head at the cal-
lous casualness of the dalton girl he
said whats new otherwise

  why its lunch time and i thought
id let you suckers buy it for me

  we just had breakfast but sit down
a minute

  she sat on the bed took a jeweled
cigarette case from her purse and stuck
a cigarette between her red lips she
lit it with an expensive lighter

  blowing out smoke she said
speaking of angles whats yours in
all this johnny fletcher

  same as you old mans dough
uh-uh come clean fletcher you
two dont care any more about money
than i do for cotton stockings jims
in it for money yes but not you two

no what would you do with
money buy some magic gimmicks or
blow it on an oat-burner

  magic said sam say i been
practicing that cigarette trick 
later sam johnny said quickly

chief okay vivian ill talk if you will

  she laughed i like that word
decoy how much commission do you
think i get on one bottle of beer at the
club

  maybe none i didnt mean it that
way you wanted us to come to the
club last night for a particular reason
was it because you wanted to make
sure we didnt go out to westchester
county maybe to hillcrest

  she turned and flipped her cigarette
stub through the open window more
than ten feet away pop said hed
tried to soften up you two and hadnt
made a dent he still wants to play
with you

  since last night

  uh-huh bonita couldnt help him
because she didnt know anything
johnny looked at her reproachfully

you wouldnt be covering up for your
mother would you 

  vivian dalton winked at him i
would  if i wanted to cover up for
her but thats straight about her and
dad being on the outs again

  she got up well if you wont buy

self

agency

jsjhe went out and johnny threw him-
self again on his bed sam walked
up and down clenching his big hands
together and cracking his knuckles

  after a moment johnny said stop
muttering about her i know shes got
under your skin but shes got ice
water in her veins

  i like ice water sam snapped
we couldda gone to lunch with her

  johnny sighed ill tell you what

detective fiction weekly

after shes gone through your roll ill
buy you a nice strong rope and you
can do the old rope trick

  a guy doesnt mind dying after a
good time its the slow starving to
death that gets you

  johnny got up from the bed well
lets make the final assault if this
blitzkrieg fails im licked

  where to this time

  the clock factory erics my last
hope to find out what the talking clock
said

  they left the room and rode down
to the lobby in the elevator as they
stepped out eddie miller grabbed
johnnys arm and whispered duck
quick the boss just got some bad news
what do you mean eddie it isnt
the first of the month   

  whats the first got to do with
it oh oh youre sunk

  mr peabody came storming out of
his office over his arm was a pair of
trousers-a pair of blue trousers with
a white pin stripe

  mr fletcher he cried in a hys-
terical voice mr fletcher i want to
talk to you

  sorry peabody johnny said
hastily im rushing out to see a man
about a big business deal talk to me
later

no you dont howled peabody
springing in front of johnny and block-
ing his retreat to the door look at
these trousers they match your suit
so they do thats a coincidence
coincidence its-its robbery
you mean theyre my pants and
you swiped them

  mr peabody choked and sputtered
your trousers you-you know what
happened hagemanns sent this pair
of trousers to me this pair and another
as big as a tent

  i resent that murmured sam

  and you know what hagemanns
man said  mr peabody went on he
said in their hurry yesterday to de-
liver these suits to me they forgot to
include the extra pairs of trousers but
i didnt order any suits from them
somebody else did that using my
charge account and giving my name
mr peabodys voice rose to a righteous
shriek

  you did that fletcher you or-
dered suits for yourself and that baboon
friend of yours and you charged them
to me these trousers match your new
suit   

  tut-tut mr peabody said johnny
loftily im sure a mistake has been
made it can easily be straightened out
   later right now ive got-

  no you dont ive telephoned
hagemanns and theyre sending their
delivery boy right over to make the
identification and then-then im go-
ing to have you arrested for theft and
fraud

tohnny placed his hand upon mr
 peabodys chest and shoved gently
but firmly sorry old man but im in
a frightful hurry

  he stepped around peabody to the
door

  eddie screamed mr peabody
stop him call the police

  the last glimpse johnny had of the
lobby as he looked over his shoulder
was the bell captain walking leisurely
to the telephone 

  on the street sam cragg trotted be-
side the swiftly walking johnny our
goose is cooked now peabodys been
waiting for something like that to hap-
pen hell press the charge against us
so hard well be lucky to get off with
life

  it looks tough johnny admitted
but ill think of something weve
the talking clock



never been tossed in jail yet have we
no what about minnesota
that was different dont bother me
now for a minute sam ive got to
think

  think of those extra pairs of pants
 you should have thought of that i
cant keep track of minor details

  they crossed times square and
headed toward eighth avenue john-
nys brain raced furiously as he strode
swiftly along he was in up to his neck
and only a miracle could save him he
knew the miracle was a large piece of
money it had to come from one of the
principles in the affair of the talk-
ing clock and the only way johnny
could get it was by solving the mystery

  the solution johnny was sure would
come only after he learned what it was

the talking clock had said at three
oclock

  they reached the building of the
quisenberry clock company and john-
ny was surprised to find two pickets
pacing up and down in front of the
building bearing sandwich signs which
declared the quisenberry clock com-
pany to be unfair to union labor in
general and specifically to local  of
the clock makers union

  tough on the old boy johnny ob-
served hes only got six months to
put the business on a paying basis and
this isnt going to make it easier for
him well lets go in

  the receptionist in the outer office
sent their names in to eric quisenberry
and a moment later they entered his
door

   to be concluded next week

the enchanted dagger

 out of the ages conies an ancient dagger an antique prize to be
 sure-but why was it so valuable that murder was committed to
 gain its possession was it because it might be the only clue to
 the fabulous lost treasure of alexander the great was it be-
 cause this blade could deal death without apparent human aid

        these are the puzzling questions that face don davolo

killer at large

   by edward roans

he slowed down as he came
to the bend in the creek the
swift surge of the canoe fell
off to a more leisurely and casual pace
he didnt want to alarm her unneces-
sarily he wasnt sure there was any-
thing to be alarmed about really but
there was no sense taking chances

  shirleys figure in dim white linen
was standing on the bungalow porch
when the canoe dug into the sandy beach
with a sharp hiss there seemed to be a

sense of tension in her slim straight
shoulders as she stood there in the eve-
ning gloom she spoke before he could
reach the steps

  alan do you hear it

  a lock of straw-colored hair looped
over his sober angular face he kept his
voice calm as he nodded

i hear it its from green hills
the sound came from all around
them filling the air echoing from the
gray willows leaning over the wide creek

crouching low the trooper
opened fire at the first blurred
figure
killer at large



to the long slope that led to the highway
above them now low and mournful
moaning and bewailing a loss now
shrill high and strident frightening-
a sense of terror in its whining shriek
the prison siren miles away blasted
endlessly through the murky evening
air it drowned out the low rumble of
thunder in the east over the city

  shirley said tightly alan that
means somebody has escaped doesnt
it

  sure he was up on the porch be-
side her now theyll catch him who-
ever he is

  he gave her an intentionally dutiful
husbandly kiss she responded by cling-
ing to him with a sudden frightening
strength

  alan   

  easy honey

  hes loose i know hes loose
there was terror in her voice in her
long fingers clutching desperately at his
shoulders she seemed to be trying to
get inside him to hide within his tall
frame the siren kept moaning over
their heads and all around them in the
hot little valley alan disengaged shir-
leys tight arms and shook her gently
he grinned at her white face in the
dusk

  youre getting upset over nothing
honey there are more than eight hun-
dred convicts in green hills it might
be any one of them

  she was obstinate in her fear its
zinzi she whispered zinzi mattlock
hes loose

  nonsense

  im sure of it she insisted

   alan listening to the tightness of her
voice knew her old sense of terror had
flooded back engulfing her he felt
despair because he had thought her
cured of the endless gnawing dread that
hid inside her this bungalow almost

within sight of the penitentiary walls
confining zinzi mattlock had been an
experiment to cure her but now her
fear had come back with even more
force than before

  thunder rumbled close overhead it
was almost dark now shirleys wide
blue eyes looked inky violet seeking
strength in alans brown somewhat
homely face she thought unreasonably
that she should never have married him
and made him share her inevitable fate
then the next moment she was over-
whelmingly grateful for the strength
of his arms around her

  alan was saying whoever it is he
cant be anywhere near here yet the
state cops will nab him youll see but
if it will make it any easier for you ill
go up the hill and see what its all
about

   ill go with you she said imme-
diately

  no theres no danger here this
is the best possible test of our plan
angel youve got to get rid of your fear
of zinzi mattlock once and for all

  the girls eyes were miserable 
cant i just cant

  stay here he repeated

  he was gone before she could stop
him striding up the path to the hill and
the highway restaurant up there she
thought disjointedly that he should
have taken the flashlight it would be
pitch black in a matter of minutes black
and rainy

  someivhere in the gathering gloom
ran a man at a curious crouching gait
he twisted and dodged like a hunted
thing there was a gun in his hand he
trotted across the highway chuckling
softly and ferreted through the thick
underbrush down a long wooded slope
water glistened below him he stum-
bled fell headlong and got up again
nothing could stop him death was his
	detective fiction weekly

mount and death chuckled with him
and sang a siren song in the air behind
him

  shirley sat down slowly on a rocker
on the bungalow porch and stared
straight out over the dusk-shrouded
creek her fingers clenched the rocker
arm until the knuckles shone white
through her tanned skin

a lan reached the top of the hill with
the last of the fading daylight he
could glimpse the vast sweep of rolling
pennsylvania countryside reaching into
the distance then it was as if a curtain
had been drawn over the peaceful green
hills miles away a searchlight stabbed
the sky in protest and alan knew it
came from green hills penitentiary
the siren wailed on unabated echoing
in waves of sound both loud and faint

   a little knot of men was gathered in
the highway restaurant when alan
stepped in he knew most of them as
vacationers occupying other bungalows
up and down the banks of the stream
at this point three girls in bright yel-
low and blue play suits were sipping
sodas at a corner table a record player
was thumping out a rhythmic tune

  the screen door banged behind him
he could hear snatches of conversation
from the knot of men

  say hes got a gun somehow and
killed a guard    dont know where
hes headed    trooper barracks
emptied up the road spreading a cor-
don    oughta warn people on the
radio tonight   

  it was all very remote the mens
voices held a note of pleasurable excite-
ment

  alan stepped closer who was it
he asked who got away

  somebody said hello graham we
dont know aint heard yet a killer
though

  from outside came a thrumming
then a snorting sound as a trooper rode
his motorcycle into the pool of bright
light in front of the restaurant alan let
the others crowd through the screen
door before him it was a young cop
very smart in his gray whipcord breech-
es and tunic his stetson was at a slant
alan knew him corporal hagan as-
signed to the barracks a half mile up the
highway

  the trooper swung off his cycle and
ignored the battery of questions fired
at him his brown eyes jerked over
the faces and settled on alan

  graham want to talk to you he
said shortly

  alan nodded mutely he thought
with a sinking sensation that he already
knew what was coming his shoes made
gritting sounds on the gravel beside the
highway as he walked with the trooper

  hagan said i dont want to alarm
you without reason

  was it zinzi mattlock who es-
caped alan asked

  yes were putting an alarm out
on the radio-it ought to be on any
minute he crushed out half an hour
ago-with help we think he had a gun
anyway he used it    murdered a
guard we dont know where hes head-
ed for but he hasnt got a car yet hell
be beating his way across country and
on a night like this- the corporals
rugged young face looked serious

   i see alan said quietly

  we know about your wife ot
course she testified against mattlock
and he swore hed get her that was last
year you werent married to her then
were you

  no we were married shortly after
the trial i helped the d a assemble
the case and did some pinch-hitting once
in a while my wifes evidence was what
we needed to convict mattlock we
killer at large



promised to protect her now that shes
my wife im doing the job myself
hagan said uneasily anyway i
thought id tell you it was mattlock
even though hes at large theres hardly
a chance in the world that he knows
your wife is so close to the prison here
at the creek but if he should find
out-

  do you think we should go back
to town

   it wouldnt be a bad idea

  alan grimly shook his head that
wouldnt help if mattlock gets away to-
night and stays in the clear there wont
be any use trying to hide from him
hagan said again well i thought
id tell you chances are hell never get
this far anyway even if he does head
in this direction we ought to pick him
up inside of an hour ill let you know
when we do he sounded brisk and
cheerful

   all right alan said

jje stood beside the road and
watched corporal hagan return to
the pool of light in front of the res-
taurant the trooper paused beside his
motorcycle and spoke a few words to
the men waiting for information then
he mounted and roared off down the
highway

   it was utterly dark down in the creek
valley now except for a few bungalow
lights on the opposite bank alans place
was lost in the inky blackness light-
ning rippled across the sky in a blue-
white sheet of flame then the thunder
rolled in slow ominous boomings a
sudden draft of cold air washed alans
lean face and he was surprised to find
himself shivering he moved down the
slope following the ruts formed by his
car which was parked beside the bunga-
low when his feet swished through tall
grass he knew he was off the road and

he kept direction that way

  he didnt know where the two men
came from they seemed to rise up out
of the dark ground like noiseless ghosts
and flank him one moment he was
walking alone toward the bungalow-
the next moment they were there press-
ing in toward him with menacing si-
lence

   hold it a voice growled

  panic seized alan for a second he
stopped dead began to whirl backward
toward the highway something hard
was jabbed into his back he went
numb all over with the cold shock of
a gun muzzle grating against his spine

   he stood frozen said ill hold it
whats up  his voice was surprisingly
calm

   the growling voice said just take it
easy see has he got a gun lew

  alan could make them out now a
tig fat man wearing a pale gray hat
and a sloppy seersucker suit the other
was shorter and younger with cold
white slits for eyes the younger man
held the gun in alans back he swal-
lowed tried to control the pounding of
his heart as deft hands flitted over his
shirt and patted the pockets of hs old
white flannels

  hes clean sure hes alan gra-
ham

  sure his wifes in the bungalow
aint she

  a dry tongue of lightning flicked
across the black sky thunder rolled and
rumbled in the blue-white glare alan
could make out the two with even more
clarity a large lazy drop of rain spat-
tered on his thin cheek

   he took a breath and said to the fat
man youre checker moog your
young pal is lew gramm you used to
be zinzis lieutenants

  the fat one chuckled a sound like

oil	pouring from a narrow-necked bot


detective fiction weekly

tie aint it a fact youre kinda clever
see can you guess some more

  alan said softly you helped engi-
neer zinzi mattlocks escape youre
waiting for him here

  check

  did you tell him my wife is here
too

  the fat man checker moog nodded
his big head ponderously he made more
oily sounds then his voice hardened
suddenly thats why we expect zinzi
to show up here take it easy graham
you and your wife wont get hurt-not
if you behave

  alan said what do you want me
to do  i cant fight back i havent got
a gun does my wife know youre
here

  nope and she need never know
you see chum your wife is bait bait
for zinzi

  a cold dread clutched at alans
throat

   i dont understand

want him we got word to him that
your wife was here so after his escape
hes sure to make a bee-line for this spot
hell go after your wife-but he wont
get her well stop him the fat mans
face was shiny and blue in a lightning
flash then it vanished into the murky
darkness again we got zinzi out so
we could finish him understand
alan moistened his lips a few more
drops of rain spattered lazily down

  i think i get it he said you
helped zinzi mattlock crush out so you
could spot him and rub him out i dont
know why and i dont care he prob-
ably knows too much about you for you
to want him to live so you mean to
kill him and shut his mouth for good
you want him to walk into a trap here
when he comes for my wife

  you got it added up right moog

said and if you know whats good for
you youll play ball you cant get back
to the highway we wont let you if
you play it right you can save your
wife zinzi is fair game for anybody

him and get away with it its up to you
to string along with us and get him be-
fore he gets your wife

   alan swallowed what do you want
me to do

   put a light on in the back room
keep your wife in the living room with
the light on zinzi wont shoot through
the window hell walk in on you and
let you know its him hes that kind
of a guy he likes to let his victims
know hes the one whos killing em so
at the first sign of trouble or any kind
of visitor you put out the light in the
back room then well come in you

  and suppose i dont play ball
alan asked

   you will you like your wife that
much you wouldnt want us to help
zinzi would you and you cant get
back to the highway again like i said
so go on in and sit with your wife
and wait

  the shorter man lew gramm re-
moved his gun from alans back and
shoved him toward the dark bulk of the
bungalow alan walked up on the front
porch without looking back shirley
stood up with a little gasp as alan came
through the screen door into the dark
living room she clung to him with cold
trembling hands

  was it-was it zinzi who got
away

   yes but theyll catch him honey
i was talking to corporal hagan hell
let us know the minute they round him
up theres nothing to worry about
his voice sounded false in his own ears
all weve got to do is wait
killer at large



hey waited alan put on the bridge
lamp and went into the bedroom
for a moment when he came back he
left the light on in there outside thun-
der pealed and then rain came down
in rushing rattling torrents shaking the
windows and drumming on the roof it
was ten oclock

  shirley sat huddled in silence on the
studio couch beside the radio alan
snapped it on his brown face lean and
composed and tried to get something
through the local thunderstorm snatch-
es of a tchaikovsky program from
philadelphias robin hood dell filled
the chilly room it wasnt raining there
twenty miles away

  the blackness beyond the windows
was thick brooding and impenetrable
alan wondered what he could do he
had nothing to fight with no gun he
picked up a heavy flashlight from the
table and kept it beside him but it was
poor comfort against the knowledge of
deadly guns waiting patiently outside

  the minutes dragged alan remem-
bered a dream he had often had in child-
hood  an ancestral racial dream filled
with primitive terror a wild ravening
beast had him trapped and defenseless
there was no further retreat the lion
or tiger or whatever his childish fancy
had made it paced back and forth be-
fore the last barricade and he was help-
less behind a thin wall filled with a
choking paralyzing terror   

  the rain slackened to a steady drizzle
and once there were flashlights dancing
far down the opposite bank of the creek
near the bend but nothing happened
and the jittery pinpoints disappeared
without coming closer a little later
alan thought he heard sirens on the
highway two hundred yards up the hill
they came and they went he sat down
beside shirley and kept his arm around
her gradually painfully the shivering

within her died away and she rested
comfortably within the circle of his arm

  somewhere in the darkness there was
a man rain-soaked and bloody with
a zvhite mask for a face and bitter
venomous eyes he staggered through
zvater and mud a gun in his hand he
was coming down the bank of the creek
the thought of death filled his warped
and tzvisted mind

  alan got up and went into the dark
kitchen peering through the screened
door he could make out the dark bulk
of checker moogs car parked under
the dripping trees there was nothing
else to see in the black shrubbery that
surrounded the bungalow he cursed
softly weighing the heavy flashlight in
his hand and considered its pitiful in-
adequacy as a weapon but he couldnt
let shirley go on being bait for a blood-
thirsty killer there must be something
he could do some way to get her up
to the road and back to the city

  he was on his way back to the liv-
ing room when footsteps clattered heav-
ily on the front porch

ghirley was on her feet her hand
at her throat staring at the door
and swallowing soundlessly her face
was chalk white her lips moved as alan
came from the kitchen but they formed
no words he grinned and said its
nothing angel and went to the front
door as somebody hammered on it with
his fist

  it was a big man in the gray tunic
and whipcord breeches of a state troop-
er a flood of relief left alans legs feel-
ing curiously weak the mans stet-
son was soggy with rain and his uni-
form was smeared with mud and ripped
by brambles light thrust from the door-
way and shone on a strong official chin
and a thin grim mouth the trooper
didnt come in from the shadows on the


detective fiction weekly

porch his voice was a hasty growl

  you folksll have to get out of here
weve located that escaped con some-
where on this bank within a mile of
here weve got him closed in

  but-

alan felt shirley come up and stand
behind him her hand oh his shoulder

  well be glad to go she said her
voice was thin over the drumming of
rain on the porch roof well leave
right now

  ive got orders to escort you people
to the city we can go in your car

   ill get my raincoat alan said help-
lessly

  he went back into the living room
and crossed to the lighted bedroom his
hands shook as he shrugged into the
thin tan coat he paused slipped the
flashlight into a side pocket and glanced
around the room where he and shirley
had spent the last week fighting demons
of fear he could hear shirleys voice
full of relief talking to the trooper on
the porch he picked up a coat for her
and went back to the front door

  all set he said

then lets go its too dangerous to
let you folks stick around here tonight

  i understand alan nodded he
wondered where checker moog and
lew gramm were and what they would
do about this trooper

  his car a battered little sedan was
parked a dozen feet from the front
porch under some gnarled and twisted
elms the blackness was absolute save
for the sharply defined beam of the
cops flashlight that guided their steps
rain blinded them and formed a white
hissing wall around them

  the trooper said you and the
missus can sit in front ill get in the
back

alan nodded again shirley sat close
beside him and he could feel the shivers

wracking her body as she pressed
against him the sedan started without
any trouble he reversed looked back
through the window as he eased the car
around the trooper sat squarely in the
middle of the seat behind him his shoul-
ders bulkily outlined against the rear
window his face a dim block beneath
his stetson alan thought the man was
grinning but he couldnt be sure

  the headlights cut a wide bright
swath through the downpour and finally
settled on the rutted road leading up
through the wooded hill to the highway
alans fingers were tight on the wheel
there was pressure in his chest and he
could feel the blood pounding through
every artery in his body

  it happened when they were a third of
the way up the hill the other car
hurtled soundlessly out of the blackness
the roar of its motor hidden behind the
thrumming of the sedan and the tattoo
of rain on the metal roof its headlights
werent on it appeared as a sudden
black bulk lurching straight toward
them at a breakneck speed over the
pugh ground

  shirley gasped

  alan look out-

alan twisted the wheel savagely

    the trooper in the back seat
straightened with a sudden curse there
came a rending crash of twisting metal
and tinkling glass as the two cars col-
lided head on a split second before the
impact alan threw his weight sidewise
against shirley the door on her side
was loosely closed deliberately left un-
latched when he had helped her in it
gave under the jolt and shirley slipped
sidewise fell from the car to the ground

  something crashed deafeningly in
alans ear and the windshield shattered
before him reeking cordite filled the
inside of the car he heard the trooper
killer at large



grunt and curse and thrust the back
door of the car open from somewhere
came an answering shot then another
followed by a high-pitched yell it was
checker moogs voice in the twisting
glare of the headlights alan saw the fat
gunman jump from his car and run to-
ward them gun in hand

  the trooper crouched on the running
board lips drawn back in a soundless
snarl his heavy gun crashed again and
moogs advance was abruptly halted
there came a sudden repetitive burst of
shots from the other side of the gun-
mans car as lew gramm the younger
hood swung into action

  a bullet whined past alans head and
smashed through a back window he
ducked low slithering sidewise and
tumbled from the car onto the ground
he felt shirley crouching behind the
car her face was white and scared in
the dimness

  alan what is it what happened

  he held her hand tightly that
crooper-hes zinzi mattlock- he felt
her stiffen easy does it honey those
other two are his former lieutenants-
checker moog and lew gramm you
remember them theyre out to get
him

  but how did you know the troop-
er-

  never mind now come on

  he pulled her away from the car
keeping the solid bulk of the sedan
between them and the gun battle raging
in the rain the wet muddy ground was
slippery under their feet shirley stum-
bled and alan caught her up and hur-
ried her forward he moved in a wide
circle and in a matter of minutes came
up behind the other car

  there was nobody in it there was no
sound but the hissing patter of rain in
the darkness nothing was visible alan
opened the back door of the strange

sedan and cautiously groped in the side
pockets his searching fingers found
what they sought a spare gun a heavy
thirty-eight he pulled it free of the
pocket and stepped back

  a man suddenly screamed in the
bushes a few yards to his right in the
blackness alan could see nothing there
came a flat savage report a moan a
crashing sound in the shrubbery as if
a body had fallen out of the darkness
loomed a mans figure lurching toward
them

  shirley whispered its zinzi matt-
lock-in a troopers uniform he got
both of them alan

  alan called out hold it zinzi ive
got a gun

 the others voice was thick with sav-
age satisfaction at least you know its
me thats what i wanted i want you
should know whos gettin you in the
end i said i d finish off your wife
graham im doin it now nothin can
stop me

an raised the thirty-eight and fired
twice at the dim bulk moving to-
ward them the unfamiliar gun jumped
and bucked in his hand he heard shir-
ley gasp again in the echoing roar and
squinted through the blackness zinzi
mattlock was still coming on

  alan whispered harshly  stay here
angel

  he stepped forward with a sudden
desperate movement he dove toward the
hulking figure approaching them his
shoulders slammed against mattlocks
chest drove the killer back with a grunt
of surprise the others gun barrel
smashed down on his shoulder sent
numbing pain through his left arm
mattlock tripped went down on the
muddy ground his gun exploded with
a roar slapping a bullet into the turf
alan kicked at his wrist felt his leg


detective fiction weekly

suddenly yanked from under him and
piled down on top of the man his fists
drove smashing blows into the others
face mattlock cursed and writhed away
like a snake alan scrambled after him
suddenly found himself free to swing
and uncorked a wild looping left that
caught the others jaw the blow
cracked loudly in the darkness he felt
zinzi mattlock twitch under his weight
then lady still

  alan rolled off him panting and
stood up shirleys figure was running
toward him he stooped painfully and
groped for mattlocks gun then be-
came aware of crashing sounds in the
underbrush and sharp rapping com-
mands

  the rutted road was suddenly filled
with troopers the first to reach him
was a queer figure in a makeshift coat
it was corporal hagan minus his uni-
form the troopers face was a dim
anxious circle as he came up to alan

  you all right

  alan nodded and took a deep breath
of rain-swept air into his aching lungs

  were both okay-shirley and i
there should be two more men around
here dead or alive checker moog and
lew gramm theyre the ones that
helped zinzi crush out they wanted to
knock him off they let him know my
wife was here so that hed make for
this spot and then they forced me to
keep shirley here as bait

  but alan shirley said how did
you know the trooper was really zinzi 

  he was wearing corporal hagans
uniform alan managed a lopsided
grin i recognized hagans badge num-
ber although zinzi was careful not to
let us see his face very clearly moog
and gramm had told me to turn out
the light in the back room if zinzi
showed up so when i went after my
raincoat i snapped it off it was a
gamble that moog could keep zinzi busy
long enough for us to break away and
get clear of the fight it worked out
fine

  hagan said slowly the dirty killer
jumped me down by the creek i was
hanging around just on a hunch he
knocked me out and took my uniform
i guess he was figuring on making you
people drive him through our net and
then hed have the satisfaction of hav-
ing forced you to help him escape be-
fore knocking you off

   alan glanced quickly at shirleys face
there was a lift to her chin a proud
look as she stood beside him and met
his anxious glance her fingers holding
his hands were warm and firm and
steady

  hagan said i guess you folksll
want to get back to town in earnest
now after this scare

  shirley said not at all theres no
more danger is there

  of course not

  then well stay theres nothing
more to be afraid of-ever isnt that
right alan

  thats right alan said

another smash bet for dpw

solving cipher secrets

a cipher is secret writing the way to solve ciphers is to
experiment with substitute letters until real words begin
to appear in solving notice the frequency of certain letters
for instance the letters e t a o n i are the most used in
our language so if the puzzle maker has used x to represent
e x will probably appear very frequently combinations of
letters will also give you clues thus the affixes -ing -ion
-ally are frequent helpful hints appear in this department
each week the first cryptogram is the easiest

hphis weeks no x- novelty cipher by
- samuel f walcott is submitted with the
comment that it might take your solvers by
surprise hence in order not to spoil the fun
it is being published without suggestions for
solution of course the solver could apply
various tests such as the vowel-count rule
which would tentatively class the cipher as
transposition if the vowels approximate  of
the whole number of letters but it must be
remembered that a constructor can often dodge
such rules in some types of substitution by
merely using symbols having respectively about
the same frequencies as the letters signified
however s f ws puzzle is bound to arouse
your interest and the full explanation will be
given in two weeks
