wt eird tales has gained its great popularity a friend told us re-
vw cently because it offers us escape from the commonplaceness of
  the matter-of-fact world about us i read it because it opens a new
door for my imagination and lets me roam for a few hours in another world
-like alfred noyes old gray squirrel the shipping-clerk who sat on a high
stool totting up figures all day long yet sailed on marvelous adventures in his
fancy to all parts of the world in the argosies whose cargoes he inventoried
or like the chinese laundryman in vachel lindsays poem who sweated at
his work all day but heard the chinese nightingale in his dreams

    writes charles m stephens from long island the improvement in
weird tales is steady and sure i know for a fact that when once weird
tales is read by a lover of gripping fiction it is read always throughout
long island the readers snap up the copies on the date they are placed on the
news stands and through the old readers here the magazine is constantly gain-
ing new ones long ago weird tales passed the experimental stage in pub-
lishing and i am happy to see it today an institution in the magazine field
george merrick cobb of santa barbara california writes to the eyrie
please oh please give us some more stories by donald wandrei his the
red brain was absolutely the sublimest thing of its kind i have ever read and
i can assure you that i am well and widely read i also must say a word
about the moon terror the serial from weird tales which you have brought
out as a book if i knew that i could never get another copy of this magnif-
icent book i would not sell mine for ten dollars

    i liked the russian flogging tale the justice of the czar in your last
number writes lieutenant c t lanham from the canal zone why not
more dealing with the rack the boot the drop the wheel the hot pincers etc 

the chinese have some lovely little devices too

b rachael  mnshdjl-and- 

    m aver i ck -terre- 

it was a long and bitter fight

it was in the explorers club
that i first noticed the expres-
sion in harvey larrisons eyes
when anthonys dog came in lar-
rison did not move there was a bare-
ly perceptible pause between the
puffs of his pipe yet for a moment
before he could clamp down on his
nerves fear looked out of them-
stark staring fear almost instantly
controlled the dog was an unusual-
ly handsome one and he went the
rounds of us seeking pats and praise
and getting them including larri-
sons no one else had noticed the
betraying flash in larrisons eyes
had it been in anyone else it would
not have been so noticeable but
harvey larrison had a reputation
for daredeviltry unequled even in
our explorers club whose members
are never what one might call cau-


tious people i began to remember
tales about larrison even an un-
pleasant hint since his return from
his last trip somewhere on the ends
of the earth

  thought you liked dogs i said
later in the evening when anthony
and his dog had left

  larrison eyed me with surprize
i do he said i have always
been extremely fond of them all
kinds in fact i see very little differ-
ence between them and man except
that caused by a few eons difference
in evolution

  you looked at teds dog queer-
ly  i persisted he did not deny it

  i had a curious experience once
he said it has made me feel
different about dogs

  i had had the luck to catch him in
the mood to get him started on the
the mystery in acatlan



story -which would explain that curi-
ous flash

  it was in acatlan it happened
he said slowly a terrible country
acatlan enormous savage half a
million years behind the rest of the
world anything could happen
there  

  seems that way said dr mc-
gonigal from out the shadows beside
the great library fireplace where we
were gathered against the harshness
of a cold and stormy night

  yes youve been there too
havent you larrison said

   	 three years   said the big scotch
doctor laconically

  anything might happen there in
acatlan repeated larrison i
have never explained this thing
there is no explanation he con-
tinued exeept one and that of
course is ridiculous impossible or
is it in acatlan

  he looked over at the doctor who
merely crossed his legs anew and
muttered something unintelligible
into his pipe

  i was lounging in the railroad
pueblo of cuernavaca continued
larrison waiting for my man pa-
blo to turn up with a wheel part which
i had ordered rushed out by express
it was too hot to go down to the sta-
tion even at  oclock in the morn-
ing so i sat under an awning eating
cordovan pineapple there is noth-
ing in all the world so pleasant to
eat as cordovan pineapple they
grow ripe on the plant and one cuts
them in two and eats them with a
spoon-sweet ice-cold and fragrant
as a field of flowers

  there was the usual crowd hang-
ing about or passing to and fro
water carriers leche camada venders
blue indians-so called because of the
blue blankets they weave and which
constitute their sole costume a piece
cut off the end for a girdle a hole in
the middle to put their heads through
and the piece out of the hole tied
niftily on their heads for a hat-

white-clad peons naked children a
woman or two in the usual soiled
chemise pounding corn for tortillas
white adobe glaring in the sun blue
shadows and unbelievable greens
and somewhere in the distance the
interminable music of a danza played
on strings that seemed to drip with
melody above the village towered
the frowning vastness of the moun-
tains strange tales are told of those
mountains dunsany must have had
some such tremendous ravines and
mist-curtained valleys in mind when he
wrote of the gods who dwell in the
folds of the hills it is impossible
to look up to those mountains and not
feel awe reverence even a little cold
fear along ones spine they seem to
be guarding with utter indifference
and relentlessness the last withdraw-
ing place of ancient gods dealing in
ancient and sometimes terrible laws

  along the sun-checkered cobbled
street i saw a dog coming it passed
quite close to me and suddenly turned
and gazed at me with its brown un-
happy eyes that is what first at-
tracted me to the dog its unhappy
beseeching eyes bewildered with pain
and fear and yet holding somehow
to a dumb blind hope i like dogs
even mexican ones which is the very
limit of affection and because the
dog seemed so miserable i smiled at
it as one would smile at a person an
unusual thing to do i admit but i
smiled in response to those eyes seek-
ing so desperately for a friend

  the dog hesitated and looked
back over its shoulder it was a
slender little beast hardly more than
a puppy dark and smooth of coat
just above one comer of its mouth
was a scar-a small deep wound
which had healed but which drew the
mouth up into an odd whimsical
quirk as it came over in answer to
my invitation i saw that its back be-
neath the soft coat was welted across
and across with scars of the lash
then all of a sudden as i patted it
swearing to myself at the brute who


weird tales

had tortured it such a look of utter
fear leaped into its eyes as i do not
like to think of it moved its muzzle
sideways as though looking desper-
ately for a way of escape then again
it turned to me i threw over the dog
the rubber poncho which i had folded
over my arm to conceal it from
whatever or whoever it was it feared
and turned to see what the dog had
seen

  he came out of the only restau-
rant-a fat sleek man with black
drooping mustaches over a hard
mouth his shirt was open half-way
down his hairy chest and his velvet
pants were trimmed with rows of sil-
ver buttons and a gay serape hung
over his shoulder i recognized the
marks of mexican wealth some
ranchero probably or a robber from
the hills he sauntered complacently
by picking his teeth and cast a lack-
luster eye in my direction evidently
seeing nothing to interest him he
passed on down the street and
around the corner

  unconsciously i heaved a sigh of
relief when he was out of sight i
hardly know why unless it was be-
cause he was one of those persons
whom one instantly dislikes how-
ever then pablo cantered up with
the wheel part strapped behind his
saddle-bags larrison continued
and i mounted and followed him
the little dog trotting along beside
me

t was working on the railroad
some thirty miles from the town
and it was late afternoon when we ar-
rived at the camp

  i went to my house changed my
clothes and went on up to the office
which was at the camp proper a
half-mile away i forgot all about
the little dog which i had left asleep
on a rug in my rooms work had
piled up in my absence and i stayed
at my desk until nearly  that night
then i knocked off work and decided
to have a bite and turn in

  i had inherited a pretty decent
place from the engineer who had pre-
ceded me and left on account of
his health it was a rambling old
hacienda long since deserted he
had only furnished one end of it
a high-ceilinged living-room with a
tiled floor a bedroom and a kitchen
he had had a fireplace built in of
stone and adobe for the evening
chill pauls down from the mountains
like so much water a fire was burn-
ing as i entered and the room looked
unusually attractive almost home-
like  i had accumulated a lot of
blankets and indian stuff and had
some books sent out to me and these
had been dusted and rearranged i
supposed mccormack had dropped
in though i had not heard him men-
tion any such intentions and had
made himself comfortable someone
was sitting in the big armchair and
moved in answer to my greeting but
made no reply i glanced at the
chair and nearly dropped in my
tracks for there sat a girl a young
thing hardly more than a child star-
ing at me with big frightened brown
eyes i dont know exactly why but
i thought instantly of the dog and
looked for him where i had left him
asleep on the hearth-rug he wasnt
there

   hello i said to the girl as
casually as i could where did you
come from

  she said nothing but got slowly
to her feet rather bewildered and
half frightened she seemed

   you-you live here she asked
in a very pure upper-class spanish

   that was my impression i re-
plied

  a moment more she stared at me
-a long somber look that seemed to
be trying to read my inmost depths
and then she smiled

   i very glad she said this time
in halting english i make fire for
you the light struck full on her
as she came forward and i was
amazed at her gentle delicate beauty
the mystery in acatlan



more that of a child than of a woman
oddly enough a small scar drew up
one corner of her mouth into a whim-
sical sort of twist

  she took my hat from my hands
and hung it up she drew the chair
toward the fire then went and got
my slippers from where i had left
them under the table and set them by
the fire

   if you will seet down she said
timidly i will take off the shoe
then i weel make the coffee i make
ver good coffee

  i sat down because i didnt know
what else to do but she seemed to
take the situation as a matter of
course

  she took off my shoes unlacing
them deftly and quickly and thrust
my feet into the slippers one of them
had a rent in the toe

   tonight i will mend that she
said

   but look here i burst out you
cant stay here you know

  she looked up at me sitting back
on her heels and her eyes filled with
tears

   please you not send me away
i be good to you i make cook i
make fire i mend elothes i do every-
ting-

   who told you i wanted a-a
servant i asked it seemed hard
to connect the word with her delicate
beauty i never said such a-

  she burst into tears and flung
herself down on the rug sobbing so
that her whole frame trembled she
crept toward me along the floor and
clung about my knees sobbing her
hair fell all about her face and as
she looked up at me her beseeching
eyes half veiled by its tangles i again
thought of the dog nowhere else
had i seen such an expression of
longing of unreasoning despair and
terror

   you no send me back she
begged you no send me back-
to him-he so cruel--he beat me so

no no you no send me back-please
-please 

  words dissolved into sobs her
little brown hands clutched me her
tangled brown head dropped upon
my knee one shoulder of the loose
garment she wore slipped back and
down and i saw across her back in-
numerable scars of the lash

    pity engulfed me even while for
some undefined reason a little cold
chill ran down my spine gently i
put my hands about her and lifted
her up she seemed such a child a
helpless frightened child to whom
someone had been unbelievably cruel
even for that land of cruelty she
collapsed on my lap and buried her
face on my shoulder her slender little
body so racked with sobbing that it
seemed almost as if it might break
under the violence of her grief i
soothed her the best way i could
though its little enough i know about
children

   dont be afraid pobrecita i
said i wont send you back if you
dont want to go no one is going to
hurt you any more

  instantly her sobs stopped and
her eyes smiled up at me all wet
with tears

   i know you are good she said
i know i make no mistake i weel
repay you i weel work for you
her instant faith was overwhelming

  while i sat wondering how on
earth i was going to get out of the
position in which i had just put my-
self she slipped away and went into
the kitchen soon she returned and
drew up the small table near the fire
and served me a deliciously cooked
meal which she must have had
already prepared and keeping hot
and fragrant perfectly made coffee
but to all questions as to who she
was and where she came from she re-
turned one answer

   but i do not know senor i
am here it has always been like
that

  when she was questioned closer


weird tales

a bewildered look came into her eyes
and she seemed frightened i saw
that she really did not know who she
was other than that the man to whom
she referred occasionally called her
chulita when he didnt happen to
be swearing at her from her ref-
erences to him i believed him to
be her father she said he was fat
and had big black mustaches there
were many blanks in her story and
always she spoke of that night or
the night when it was a week
before i discovered that she had never
seen daylight and did not know that
the world ever looked other than dark
or moonlit she supplied all lapses
by saying  it must have been while i
sleep  it seemed she slept during the
daytime or entered some sort of
comatose state of which she retained
no slightest memory otherwise she
seemed perfectly normal  

  ay muttered the doctor look-
ing more than he said our guest
went right on with his strange tale

t was in a quandary larrison

  a said what on earth could i
do with her to be sure she was
only a mexican but youth and
beauty and a childs delicate inno-
cence such as seemed to be hers must
be shielded regardless of such matters
as nationalities

 there was not a woman in the
camp and only one other white man
besides myself - mccorirck who
sometimes tramped up from the camp
to spend the night with me over
scotch and soda and cigars and
memories ofback home i was tired
out from work and the long ride up
from cuernavaca and i left the
problem to the morrow and tumbled
into bed and instant sleep

  in the morning i found the room
exquisitely clean and set in order my
torn slipper mended and hot food
upon the fire but of the girl there
was no sign no one was about ex-
cept the little brown dog asleep upon
the rug she rose and came to me

fawning at my feet looking up at me
with brown eyes of adoration and
gratitude her mouth drawn up into
a sort of one-sided smile by the scar
i patted her and pulled her ears but
somehow in spite of myself a sus-
picion of a chill ran down my back

  however as i plunged into the
routine of work surrounded by noise
and the matter-of-factness of every-
day affairs the breath of superstition
passed away the dog followed me
about the yard or lay asleep in the
sun in my office i told mccormack
about the girl and he was highly
amused the more so because of my
seriousness

   if she followed you up from
cuernavaca its because she likes
you  he said

   but she didnt follow me up i
expostulated there was no one at
all on the road

   these indians have trails of
their own he said no white man
can follow them what the ell
take the goods the gods send you and
forget it

   but shes so infernally young
i exclaimed

   yeh said mccormack better
leave your watch with me them
young innocent kinds usually the
worst besides what else can you do
with her away out here anyway
and what else could i do with
her send her back to be beaten by
that fat scoundrel at least she was
safe and well cared for in my big
place besides she might go again
as mysteriously as she came

    toward sunset the dog roused
herself from her sunny corner by my
desk and scratched at the door i let
her out somewhat impatiently for i
wanted to finish a letter before dark
an hour or two later i called for mc-
cormack and invited him to spend
the evening with me

  the house was lit when we ar-
rived and there was a savory smell
of cooking in the air chulita was
there and served us a most delicious
the mystery in acatlan



supper the dog was nowhere in
sight

   but there is no dog senor she
said when i asked her i have see
no dog

   i hope she hasnt got lost i
said

 we spent a pleasant evening
smoking and talking while chulita
sat quietly in a corner sewing but-
tons on my clothes she seemed to
have only one idea-to be of service
to me

   shes a winner said mccormack
as he turned in beside me later
some baby pup

  for some reason the old joke ir-
ritated me

qeveral days passed my house

  was cleaned as it had never
been cleaned before my lamps
were always filled my clothes mend-
ed and washed and pressed my sup-
per delightfully cooked and served
in the mornings there was no sign of
chulita i never saw her in the day-
time and whatever she did about the
house she evidently did at night or
in the evenings before i came home
from the office i paid her a weeks
wages but she left them untouched
in a jug in the kitchen she seemed
to have no other wants than to look
after my welfare and no other pay
but praise for her work in all her
attitude there was never a touch of
coquetry she was a child a happy
inconsequential child easily hurt
easily angered easily pleased

  i noticed after a while that i
never saw the dog in the nighttime
in fact i never saw the dog and
chulita together the dog always
grew restless toward evening and
would trot off into the woods though
i always found him asleep on the rug
at home in the morning gradually
the preposterous idea which i had
felt rather than thought died away

    then one day i heard an unusual
commotion in the yard and pablo
came in

   there is an hombre out there
who raise hell senor he said he
say you steal his dog 

  i told pablo to bring him in and
he returned with the fat man i had
seen in cuernavaca he had even
more silver buttons on his velvet
pants and an even more gorgeous
serape over his shoulder and evi-
dently a goodly lot of pulque under
his large belt

   i want my dog he exclaimed
loudly you damn tief you steal
my dog

   is that your dog i asked
pointing to the little brown animal
asleep in the sun

  a curious look lit up the mexi-
cans face a shadow of fear crossed
it and greed and something else

     here you  he snapped savage-
ly and the dog sprang to life quiver-
ing and terrorized

   well you cant have her i
said a man that treats a dog as
you have treated that beast cant get
any animal from me

   but shes my dog began the
mexican

   she may have been your dog
but shes mine now i interrupted
she followed me and ive had her
three weeks just to keep your feel-
ings from being hurt i  pay for her
here i threw five dollars on the
table

  the mexicans eyes blinked at
the amount but he drew himself up
haughtily i want no money he
said i want my dog come here
you

  the dog whined and crouched
cast me a look of entreaty and creep-
ing over to me laid her head against
my feet the mexican swore and
kicked at it viciously with his
spurred boot he missed the full
force of the blow but the sharp spur
tore a ragged line across the dogs
shoulder

  the ensuing combat was swift
and to me extremely pleasant after
the mexican had picked himself out


weird tales

of the dirt-pile in the yard in which
he found himself he turned a face
convulsed with rage toward me

   i have you arrest he shrieked
you steal my girl-i mean my dog i
have you arrest

  clearly the man was drunk

   go to it i remarked flexing
my arm plenty more medicine
where yours came from shes my
dog and she stays my dog heres
your money and thats all there is to
it

  he took himself off grumbling
and muttering threats under his
breath

   bad business said mccormack
to me afterward those greasers
never forget and the damn dog
isnt worth a nickel anyhow

   maybe not i said but i like the
little beast somehow its so dam
pathetic and besides it likes me
which after all is probably half of
why most of us like dogs we enjoy
the flattery of their devotion

t did not see the dog again that

  a day and i did not think par-
ticularly of the matter again having
company affairs upon my mind but
that night as chulita leaned over to
serve me the enchiladas her bodice
slipped back from her shoulder and
i saw a freshly made jagged red
scar on her shoulder as though a
spur had struck across it somehow
i found it difficult to finish my
supper

  of course it was an accident a
coincidence it was ridiculous to
think anything else-worse than
ridiculous what strange notions
came from staying for years up in
these lonely savage mountains how
i would laugh at myself for even
dreaming remotely of such a possi-
bility once- was back in safe and
sane everyday new york but in-
sidiously the idea remained

  then another complication arose

i fell in love with chulita i tried to

argue myself out of it to reason and
to shame myself out of it without
avail i could not get home early
enough it seemed to me to the house
which was a house no longer but a
home

  as for chulita she too was
changing the haunted look left her
eyes and a look of happiness suc-
ceeded it the scars on her pretty
back healed and faded i still treat-
ed her as i would a child a lovable
and loving child though more and
more i felt toward her as toward a
woman and i thought she felt the
same toward me i surprized depths
in her gaze and once when our hands
inadvertently touched i saw her
tremble i determined to marry her
and told mccormack so after one of
his rude jokes which angered me

   go ahead he said stick your
head in the noose if youre deter-
mined to 

   why shouldnt i marry her i
demanded shes as sweet as they
come and good too and shes a
lady

  where did she come from
whats her name how do you
know she aint married already
what is she anyway he demanded
to all of which i replied that i didnt
know and didnt care

   chulita i love you im not
good at fancy speeches but will you
marry me   i asked her that night

  she looked up at me with those
great lathomless brown eyes i will
do anything you want she replied
what is this to marry

   i love you i told her i love
you so much that i cant talk about
it

   oh she sighed resting her
head against me to love i know
what that is

 get ready i told her after a
while  tomorrow we will ride down
to cuernavaca and get the padre to

the red ray flashed after him and in a moment he too lay a dis-
torted thing of cloth and flesh upon the ground

it would be as well perhaps in
attempting this record of the
most deadly peril that ever
threatened our planet to give first
only the bare facts of the things be-
ginning as they came before the
public at the time there is infor-
mation enough for our use in the
staid columns of scientific journals
one finds it and in the monographs
of certain anthropological societies
and in the headlines of filed news-
papers so it is back to these that
we go now back to that first start-
ling announcement which marked
for us the things beginning

  it was early in january that the
great eastern university gave to the
press the information that a scien-
tific expedition to the arctic was be-
ing organized of which dr angus

mcquirk the universitys brilliant
anthropologist was to be the head
the expeditions objective it was
stated would be corson island one
of the numerous little ice-covered
bodies of land lying north of the
parry archipelago within several
hundred miles of the pole itself an
extensive search was to be made for
ruins and other traces of ancient
man believed to exist there and it
was hoped that the results of that
search might throw new light on the
problem of mans place of origin
the announcement added that the
party would leave for the north early
in july proceeding in a chartered
ship up to baffin bay and through
the belcher channel and then north
to the island itself

that first announcement brief as
it was aroused a very definite inter-

                                  


weird tales

est among members of the scientific
world an interest that was derived
in great part from the prominence of
dr mcquirk the expeditions mov-
ing spirit for mcquirk though but
a few years over forty was conceded
to be one of the three greatest living
anthropologists and his works on the
subject had become contemporary
classics a tall lowering-browred
scotsman of dour speech and man-
ner he was to pupils and colleagues
alike a forbidding figure though the
brilliant quality of his work was re-
spected by all it was only that
respect indeed that saved his pro-
jected expedition from the attacks
of his fellow scientists since the en-
terprise itself was such a departure
from accepted theories that it could
hardly go unchallenged

  for long it was true there had
been suggestions that some traces of
mans origin or past might lie hid-
den in the bleak white wastes of the
north but such suggestions had been
considered only as interesting fan-
cies for whatever remains of an-
cient man might exist in the arctic
it was pointed out were forever hid-
den from discovery by the great
ice-fields which cover all land around
the pole extending as far south as
the lower half of greenland any
quest for clues to mans past in those
mighty frozen wastes would be a
search comparable only to the pro-
verbial needle in a haystack

  this much indeed was admitted
by mcquirk himself but against it
he asserted that his own expedition
was working on a definite lead and
would confine its efforts to the rela-
tively small area of corson island
for many years a strange story had
been current among the eskimos con-
cerning that island a story changed
and distorted as it passed from
mouth to mouth but remaining at
bottom the same the core of the
tale was that somewhere in the
islands interior was a place where
great ruins of stone and metal pro-

jected partly through the ice ruins
which the superstitious natives as-
serted had been erected by devils
long ago the place itself was
shunned by them as a spot accursed
but more than one of their wander-
ing hunting-parties had landed on
the island and had glimpsed the
ruins from a distance

  it is probable that this tale in one
form or another had been related to
most of the white explorers and
traders who had ever visited that
section of the arctic but apparently
it had been rejected by all of them
as a mere fabrication of native
legend one man though a mission-
ary from one of the prince albert
land settlements had heard the
story several times and had been
struck by the fact that whoever told
it always placed the scene of it at the
same spot on corson island such
unanimous exactitude of position
seemed to him quite unusual for an
eskimo legend and also he was
aware that the interior of the icy
island had never yet been explored
by white men his interest in the
thing had steadily grown and final-
ly through his curiosity and letters
to the press the matter had come to
the attention of mcquirk himself

  to the average scientist perhaps
the thing would have seemed flimsy
enough as a ground for forming an
investigating party but to mcquirk
it was the opportunity of a lifetime
the chance to realize his deepest am-
bition he was a great anthropolo-
gist but he had resolved to be great-
est to solve anthropologys greatest
riddle-the riddle of the birthplace
of man year after year others had
sought the answer to that enigma
and across the bleak plains of mon-
golia and the fastnesses of african
jungles and the scattered isles of the
pacific their expeditions had toiled
and searched and toiled and searched
in vain and such efforts would re-
main always in vain mcquirk con-
tended since it was his belief that
the polar doom



the place they sought the place of
mans origin lay hidden somewhere
under the polar ice-fields of the
north

  so it was that this news of strange
ruins in the icy arctic was as flame
to tinder to his fanatic scientists
soul on the strength of that news
using all his prestige and influence
he had managed to obtain backing
for his expedition which he confi-
dently predicted would lay bare the
last secrets of anthropology and
throw a flood of new light  the
past of the human race so through
the months that followed that first
announcement the expeditions sup-
plies and equipment were gradually
assembled and in the first week of
july it took its departure from new
york in the auxiliary schooner de-
light which had been specially char-
tered and fitted for the trip

  the party when it sailed proved
to be a comparatively small one it
included besides dr mcquirk his
only close relative his sunny-haired
younger brother david who had
long acted as his assistant three
archeologists and ethnologists from
eastern universitys staff drs low-
ell mcgrath and drivoli and a
field representative of the north
american museum named chapman
who was to act as the expeditions
radio operator there were also
three hard-bitten canadians expe-
rienced in arctic work who were to
have charge of the new motor-
sledges which would be used in pen-
etrating the islands interior while
the ship itself was manned by new
england officers and crew

tour days after leaving new york
r the delight touched at st johns
harbor taking on the last of its sup-
plies and then proceeding north
along the labrador coast and up
davis strait daily the ship report-
ed its position and progress by radio
but as it crept farther and farther
north the calls of its powerful appa-

ratus came fainter and fainter to the
listening stations by the time the
schooner had passed through bel-
cher channel and was threading
its way northward through the maze
of the parry archipelago trouble
was already being experienced in re-
ceiving its signals

 on september th two months
after the expeditions departure a
message from the delight was re-
ceived by the canadian government
station at fort de roche announcing
that the ship had anchored off the
coast of corson island and that the
scientific party was completing its
preparations for the expedition into
the interior the motor-sledges had
been tested and had worked perfect-
ly the message added and a start
into the island would be made soon

  almost immediately after the re-
ception of that message the thread of
communication with the schooner
was abruptly snapped since a few
hours later there burst out one of
those intense electrical disturbances
peculiar to the polar regions which
smothered all attempts at communi-
cation beneath an unbroken roar of
static for almost a week the static
tempest raged before lessening it
was on the sixth day when the
crashing bursts were just beginning
to subside that a half-dozen cana-
dian stations picked up that brief
fragmentary message from the de-
light which was to focus on the
schooner the attention of most of the
world

  it would be best perhaps to give
that message verbatim in the inco-
herent static-broken condition in
which it was first taken down so it
is presented hereinafter exactly as
received at the time just before mid-
night on the th the records of it
kept by the receiving stations having
been collated and checked against
each other

     e days ago that mcquirk and our
par    ooners crew to help us    at
came out of the do    uirk had dug up
death    ivoli captain mate and all of


weird tales

crew all are dead all dead and i am
onl    ying myself god help m    a
is a horror from    th    enth going
fas    bye  

  for many hours after the reception
of that broken enigmatic message
constant calls went out to the schoon-
er in an effort to re-establish com-
munication with it but there was no
faintest signal of response the mes-
sage itself had been at once relayed
to the officials of eastern university
and had at the same time been seized
upon by the newspapers the more
sensational of which headlined the
matter on the following day and
through all that day and the next
and the next the unceasing calls of
the northern stations to the schooner
went quite unanswered

  by that time the matter had become
a press sensation of the first impor-
tance this was due not only to the
prominence of dr mcquirk and his
fellow scientists but also to the mys-
tery which surrounded the expedi-
tions fate-mystery which had been
intensified by the last incoherent mes-
sage from the delight if reliance
could be placed on that message at
least part of the expeditions person-
nel had already perished what mis-
hap they had met with though re-
mained a problem and an even great-
er problem was whether any members
of the party had managed to escape
the death which had overtaken the
rest

  it was the latter question indeed
that seemed of most importance to the
university officials and through their
urgings extraordinary efforts were
made to re-establish communication
with the ship constant calls were
broadcast from the powerful fort de
roche and lac dor stations while
over all canada and the northern
united states professional and ama-
teur operators alike listened intently
for some signal from the delight
but all such efforts proved in vain
since at the end of a week the veil of
silence that screened the schooner

from the world remained quite un-
changed

  by that time it had become appar-
ent to the authorities at eastern uni-
versity that there was no hope of radio
communication with the ship yet
there seemed no other possible method
of getting in touch with the expedi-
tion it was impossible to send a
ship to the island for investigation
for it was now well into september
and already the first floes of the great
polar ice-pack would be sweeping
down upon the island from the north
long before any ship could reach it
the island would be hemmed in for
hundreds of miles by a mighty frozen
waste through which no ship in the
world could force a way because of
this it was conceded by all that noth-
ing could be accomplished until the
breaking-up of the ice in the spring

  a last chance however showed it-
self in the form of an announcement
from the canadian government stat-
ing that one of the aviators attached
to the government topographical ex-
pedition in victoria land had been
ordered to attempt a flight to corson
island five hundred miles to the
north lieutenant warren and his
plane were to start at the first favor-
able moment the announcement add-
ed and it was hoped that he might
be able to combat the arctic storms
long enough to reach the island and
discover the expeditions fate

  this news held little of hope
though even for the most optimistic
for by that time almost all had come
to believe that the members of the ex-
pedition and the schooners crew had
already perished the   all are dead  
phrase in the delights cryptic last
message was recalled and the general
expression of opinion was that the
matter might be considered a closed
one another tragic chapter in the
tragic history of arctic exploration

  even the university officials were
forced to admit the probability of this
view reluctantly they decided that
until spring and the breaking-up of
the polar doom



the polar iee nothing further could be
done the matter was already disap-
pearing from the newspapers by that
time passing simultaneously from the
fickle public interest even in scien-
tific circles the loss of the brilliant
mcquirk occasioned only a few ex-
pressions of polite regret the sensa-
tion like all sensations of yesterday
was already all but forgotten

  forgotten-and in street and build-
ing factory and office theater and
school the life of the busy world
hummed on-a life a civilization so
complex and broad-based and well
ordered that it was incredible that it
could ever be shaken or destroyed by
any force or forces so it must have
seemed then certainly none there
was who guessed that even at that
moment an ancient menace was rising
and gathering and growing beneath
which that civilization would crash
like a flimsy toy none there was
who dreamed that the only warning
of the coming terror that was ever to
be received had been disregarded mis-
understood and that away in the icy
north the events of eons were rushing
toward a climax which would mark
the end forever of the age-old reign of
man



it seems probable now that no com-
plete history of the coming of the
terror will ever be written the very
scope and magnitude of the thing
make that impossible one could as
well write a history of an earthquake
for there is no visible chain of cause
and effect no sequence of rationally
connected events to be detailed noth-
ing but panic ruin death smiting
suddenly out of the unknown and
then receding into the unknown again
before their nature had ever been
suspected by the dazed and staggering
world

  the best that can be done indeed
is to make some attempt at picturing
the thing as it appeared at the time

on that fateful evening of september
th when it burst first upon the
world and one begins such an at-
tempt inevitably with the striking of
the thing at winnipeg since it was
there that the first blow fell

  the sources of our information con-
cerning the attack on the northern
city are unsatisfactory in the extreme
being mostly garbled and distorted
accounts of terror-stricken survivors
which contradict each other at a score
of points even seen through these
conflicting stories though the main
phases of the thing are clear enough
though some minor features of it are
subjects of dispute to this day

  it seems established now that it was
some few minutes past  oclock when
the thing first struck just at sunset
of the long september day-a sunset
that flamed crimson and gold in the
west its last glowing rays falling
upon the citys streets in which the
ever-moving life and traffic seemed to
have lessened for a moment the last
crowds of homeward-bound workers
had surged through those streets an
hour before and now there were only
a few chance pedestrians hurrying to-
ward an awaiting dinner and a thin
last trickle of automobiles hastening
toward the suburbs the evening
theater rush had not yet begun and
for the moment the streets lay com-
paratively empty beneath the waning
westward light and it was then that
there came the terror

  there was a sudden startled cry
from one of the pedestrians a cry that
spread along the street like flame that
was taken up and repeated by a score
of voices almost instantly and si-
multaneously there was a craning of
necks toward the sky as those in the
streets gazed up in response to that
shout but as they looked they fell
suddenly silent

  sweeping above the city from tin
north a score of dark mighty shapes
were speeding smoothly through the
air a thousand feet above the streets-
shapes that were each a score of feet


weird tales

in diameter with flat bottoms and
curving sides and domed tops re-
sembling gigantic chocolate-drops in
form their smooth sides glinted
dully in the last afterglow from the
sunken sun and as they sailed
through the air with effortless ease
and speed there came down to the
stunned watchers a thin buzzing
whine as of the operation of fine-run-
ning high-powered machines

  and now in answer to the cries of
those who watched the buildings of
the city were vomiting their occupants
into the streets and as from house
and office and factory they came forth
they too looked up and saw and
shouted in wonder the massed fly-
ing-domes were moving ever more
slowly by then until at last they
stopped and hung motionless in the
air a thousand feet above the heart of
the city and from below the thou-
sands watched

  until that moment there had been
not the merest hint of fear in all those
watching crowds their strongest emo-
tion being an overpowering surprize
and curiosity it was the general
half-formed thought no doubt that
these were airplanes or dirigibles of a
new sort being presented to the world
in spectacular fashion and as the
dark shapes hovered above them in the
graying dusk a babel of excited dis-
cussion and speculation was sweeping
through the crowds who watched

  then abruptly the massed domes
above separated dropped downward
within a hundred feet of the citys
roofs hovering here and there in stra-
tegic positions above its streets and
squares and as they sank downward
through the deepening twilight a puz-
zled murmur sped across the crowds
below a first vague sense of fear
there was a sudden stir of movement
from beneath the dark shapes that
loomed above a backward-moving suc-
tion of the crowds from under them
a moments uneasy silence and then
the whole tableau was cut suddenly

short as death leapt down upon the
city from the hovering domes above

  from each of them sudden rays of
brilliant red light stabbed down to-
ward the massed crowds below sweep-
ing swiftly over them and cutting
across them in gigantic swaths of
death for wherever that ray passed
over stupefied men and women it left
behind only tiny twisted little masses
of flesh and cloth the humans it
touched shrinking instantly into those
tiny heaps of dead flesh lying silent
in dreadful death there was a single
moment of terrible stillness as that
death seared across the crowds and
then with a vast composite roar of
utter terror they were turning flow-
ing away in all directions buffeting
in mad panic through the streets
while after them leapt the crimson
merciless ray

  it is only now indeed that we have
come to appreciate with understand-
ing the terrible power of that ray
the principle of it however we had
undeistood long before we knew
that any matter any object is com-
posed of vast numbers of tiny mol-
ecules in ceaseless motion molecules
spaced as far from each other propor-
tionately as are the planets of our
universe knowing this we know
too that if in some way the molecules
of an object could be spaced closer
pressed together jammed into a com-
pact mass the object which they
formed would be destroyed shrunken
compressed itself into a tiny and in-
conceivably dense form and it was
this very compression of molecules
which the red ray accomplished since
in some way it endowed the molecules
of any object it touched with a power
of attracting each other drawing
closer together because of that attrac-
tion compressing the object which
they made up into a dense shapeless
fragment of its former self

  and as this compression ray swept
over the fleeing crowds every object
touched by it dwindled compressed
instantly humans shrunk to com-
the polar doom



pact little masses of distorted flesh
and cloth streets furrowed deeply be-
neath its touch automobiles changed
to twisted little wrecks of metal and
as the brilliant rays lifted and seared
along the sides of buildings there came
crash upon thundering crash as the
stone and steel on those sides shrank
suddenly and allowed the rest of the
edifice to collapse and fall

  it had become completely dark by
then and under the pall of that dark-
ness the city had changed into an in-
ferno of roaring terror a place of
fear-mad rushing crowds and panic
inconceivable through the streets
they surged and swept while ever
from above the blinding rays played
on sweeping deliberately about the
city leveling great buildings with
mighty crashes that buried thousands
beneath falling wreckage sweeping
through street and square in brilliant
death to lick up and destroy the mobs
that pressed madly through those
streets

ixithin ten minutes the heart of
v  the city had become a place of
unearthly ruin and death piled with
the wreckage of its buildings choked
with the distorted and shrunken dead
over all the city lay darkness by
then no electrics relieving it because
of the severed cables but out in the
surrounding suburbs were shouts and
moving lights as the first exodus of
the terror-stricken masses swirled
along street and road over these
now the flying-domes were speeding
flashing the red ray across them as
they passed cutting wide lanes of
death across the cowering masses
passing from over the city to the great
steel web-work of the railroad yards
and lines the communication center
of half a continent there the ray
cut and whirled again ripping great
swaths of destruction across the clus-
tering tracks beneath crippling the
nerve-centers of canadas transporta-
tion system that done the smiting
rays vanished there was a gathering

buzzing drone as the domes massed
together again and then they were
speeding away to the east leaving the
wrecked city a place of death and ruin
and utter panic fear

  because of the destruction of the
telegraph lines it was many minutes
as we now know before there went
out to the world the first word of the
death that had devastated winnipeg
in the form of a halting radio-message
which stated only that unknown
forces of terrific power had appeared
above the city and destroyed the
greater part of it even while that
first message of warning was flashing
through the ether the flying-domes
must have been speeding east with in-
credible velocity for within a quarter-
hour they had covered the eight-
hundred-mile stretch between winni-
peg and montreal and were descend-
ing to rain death and destruction from
the upper darkness upon the latter
city

  it would be profitless to give here
any close attention to the attacks on
montreal and quebec striking at the
two metropolises of the north in quick
succession as they did and before any
warning could be received or under-
stood the two attacks were replicas of
that upon winnipeg-minutes of red
terror during which the blinding rays
seared down through the upper night
to cut across the cities in great trails
of ruin and death and then the
domes had massed again and were
again speeding away this time toward
the south their objectives as we know
now being boston and the city of
new york

  we know too that by the time they
started south some warning of the at-
tack on winnipeg and montreal had
already been broadcast and so it was
that by the time the domes reached
boston they found the city already in
the throes of an intense panic its
streets already choked with the rush
of fear-driven thousands because of
this the loss of life at the massa-
chusetts city was far below that in the


weird tales

three canadian cities for thousands
had already made their escape by that
time the work of destruction
though was the same at boston as at
the others the rending rays cleaving
across massed buildings and bridges
and streets until the city lay a single
waste of wreckage and then again
the domes had lifted and were racing
still farther south this time toward
new york itself

  it is probable that the hour th at pre-
ceded their coming to the hudson-
side metropolis had been the most
frenzied in the great citys history
out from east side and west through
the narrow streets and across the
parks and squares had rolled the first
panic-stricken mobs sweeping in vast
waves toward the bridges eastward or
toward the ferry-docks pouring be-
tween the walls of the clifflike build-
ings in continuous human torrents of
increasing density and as word
came in quick succession of the de-
struction of montreal and quebec
and then of boston the last doubters
were convinced of the death that was
racing toward them and ran out to
join the swelling mobs outside when
the massed domes finally swept down
upon the city from the north bridges
were jammed with tight-packed thou-
sands pushing blindly forward while
other thousands in the last extremities
of panic had streamed toward the ve-
hicular tunnels beneath the hudson
since by then the crews of the ferry-
boats had refused to return to the
island to transport more hordes to
the farther side

  during the time that had elapsed
since the first warning though the
military authorities at new york had
not been idle and had had time to
make a few hasty preparations in-
conceivable as these successive attacks
upon the northern cities were in
power and motive the authorities at
manhattan yet realized that their own
city would be likely to suffer next and
so even while the domes sped south-
ward through the night men were

working madly to prepare for their
coming some three-score of anti-
aircraft pieces mounted on tractor-
mounts had been stored at the navy
yard in brooklyn and these were
swiftly rushed across to the island
of manhattan where they were
distributed at strategic positions in
streets and squares over the island
and hastily camouflaged by covers of
tarpaulins far out at sea too the
north atlantic battle-fleet was racing
shoreward under forced draft and
though it could not reach the city for
some hours the planes of its two great
aircraft-carriers the delaware and
the bennington were rising from the
decks and roaring westward through
the night toward the threatened city

  while these preparations went on
the millions on the island were press-
ing still toward its edges forcing hun-
dreds into the water pushing and
striking to win their way out be-
hind them as if in silent mockery
the flaring electric signs that rose
above the streets were still winking
on and off with insensate persistence
and high above these there swung
and stabbed and circled the great
beam from the giant searchlight on
governors island abruptly that
beam stopped swung back held
steady and then over all the shout-
ing tens of thousands beneath there
swept a sudden silence dense over-
whelming a silence in which all gazed
up as though stricken by a very pa-
ralysis of awe and terror

  for there two thousand feet above
the citys highest pinnacle there hung
a score of dark clustering shapes
domes of metal whose sides gleamed
beneath the brilliance of the great
searchlight domes that hovered silent
and motionless above the great city
and silent motionless the vast
crowds watched

  abruptly there burned down from
one of the hovering domes a narrow
shaft of dazzling light that struck
downward and swept along the river
east of the island in a titanic slicing
the polar doom



sweep cutting through the three great
bridges there as a knife might cut
through cardboard with a rumbling
thunder that was like the crash of
doom the bridges buckled and fell
collapsed into the waters below spill-
ing the jammed thousands upon them
downward in a falling shower of tiny
figures

  over the city again was silence
now the silence of death and then the
domes were dropping smoothly down-
ward lower and lower until they were
within a scant five hundred feet of the
citys towers then a rocket flared
green above the city in dazzling sig-
nal tarpaulin covers were abruptly
pulled aside and the descending
domes were suddenly confronted by
the muzzles of a half-hundred up-
ward-pointing guns

  therewas an instant in which the
world itself seemed to hold its breath
and then red flame burst skyward
from the massed guns in one tremen-
dous burst of shattering thunder
amid the crash of exploding shells
above six of the hovering shapes
crumpled twisted and fell whirling
blindly down into the streets below

crom the watching crowds there

	burst forth a tremendous shout of
mad triumph a shout that suddenly
stilled broke off changed into a dull
crescendo roar of terror for the
domes above staggered by that unex-
pected blow yet held their ground
and from them there leapt downward
a hell of crimson death a hundred
shafts of deadly rays that stabbed and
seared along the streets in swift de-
stroying power before one of the
guns below could fire again they lay
sprawled in twisted wrecks of metal
the men around them shrunken lumps
of flesh while the wild sweep of the
whirling rays sent a score of mighty
towers crashing to the earth in sudden
collapse and ruin

  and now as the frenzied masses be-
low swirled from street to street in
blind effort to escape the death-trap

of the island there came a powerful
droning from the east and over the
island and into the glare of the
searchlights came the great seaplanes
from the approaching fleet their guns
spitting lead as they drove toward the
hovering metal domes

  the latter minded them hardly
more than a swarm of angry flies the
bullets glancing harmlessly from their
metal sides while their own rays swept
the sky in brilliant destruction send-
ing plane after plane crumpling down
toward the ground within fifteen
minutes more than two hundred
planes had utterly perished driving
fearlessly toward the domes until the
last in an agony of expectation the
masses below waited for the death
from which they could not escape but
instead of sending that death down
upon them the domes themselves
dropped quickly toward the darkened
city toward the spots where the
wrecks of their own companions had
fallen leaving only three above to
circle and hover in watchful observa-
tion

  a few minutes only the shapes on
the ground remained there evidently
inspecting and removing something
from the wreckage of their compan-
ions for the clatter of moving metal
came through the darkness to the
tense waiting crowds though none
could glimpse through the darkness
what was taking place then the
metal shapes drove up again toward
the zenith hovering for a moment
and then sped northward leaving the
destruction of the metropolis beneath
but partly accomplished the crowds
in that metropolis watched them go-
ing breathless hardly able to credit
their own reprieve from death then
all of them were suddenly shouting

  out in the suburban cities thoiigh
to north and south and west the exo-
dus of panic was still continuing and
from there through radio and tele-
graph and telephone the first news of
the events at new york was flashing
across the nation across the world


weird tales

and that news at once precipitated
the greatest panic which the world
had ever known a panic intensified by
the mystery behind this staggering in-
vasion none knew who or what these
invaders might be and none knew
what city they might strike at next
so within hours from every city in
the world from amsterdam and lon-
don and melbourne and buenos aires
thousands were fleeing pushing their
way out into open country with the
fear of death at their backs and
though through the passing hours
there came no word of further at-
tacks or any news as to where the in-
vaders had gone the panic deepened
instead of lessening

  all the forces of law were crum-
bling beneath the anarchy of uni-
versal fear the organizations of
centuries were swiftly disintegrating
and disappearing and over all earth
men waited in expectant terror for
the return of those enigmatic invad-
ers from the unknown whose first
colossal blows had already shattered
the civilization of a world



it is only now looking back upon the
terror with the insight bom of
later knowledge that we can see upon
what trivial circumstances depended
the outcome of it all much of the
working of fates tiny cogs we can not
even yet discern no doubt but we
understand enough now to appreciate
the results which were to follow from
that brief order which sent young
francis warren and his plane roar-
ing north over the gray expanse of
melville sound toward corson island

  for three months warren a lieu-
tenant in the dominion air force
had been attached to the government
party which was mapping the bleak
stretches of victoria land that great
barren island which lies just north of
the canada mainland it had been
monotonous enough his work so when
the order came to attempt a flight to

the icy island northward he was eager
to obey

  it was on the morning of the th
that he made his start some several
hours before that staggering attack on
winnipeg his little amphibian plane
rolled lightly across the level ground
and then lifted smoothly into the sun-
light while warren who had elected
to fly alone waved his arm in a fare-
well gesture to those on the field be-
hind him slanting sharply up he
turned and circled once then sped
away toward the north

  the morning was one of brilliant
sunlight and warren snug in his
electric-heated flying-suit whistled
and sang to feel the rush of the cold
clean air against him as he fled north
he was confident that he could reach
the island if no sudden arctic storm
arose since the tanks of his plane held
sufficient fuel for almost two thousand
miles of flight while corson island
lay less than six hundred miles to the
north

  the misty brown land behind faded
quickly from view as he sped north
over the gray waters of the great
sound holding an even height of a
mile and keeping a sharp lookout for
drifting wreckage which might give
some clue as to the delights fate
nothing was to be seen however ex-
cept occasional white bergs forerun-
ners of the vast polar ice-pack drift-
ing majestically southward like
mighty floating cathedrals of ice as
he sped farther and farther to the
north the bergs beneath dotted the
sea ever more thickly until at last by
the sixth hour of his flight he was
flashing on over tremendous drifting
floes which lay upon the oceans sur-
face like floating ivory islands

  ahead the redly glowing sun was
dropping swiftly toward the horizon
marking the end of the brief arctic
day its last rays gleamed bloodlike
for a moment on the drifting ice be-
low and then vanished like an ex-
tinguished light and then around
him was the swiftly gathering night
the polak doom



and the white arctic stars  peered
down at him incuriously as his plane
thundered on

  for how long he sped on through
the darkness his eyes straining down
through the pale starlight for some
glimpse of the island he could not
later guess he knew only that his
whole attention was suddenly attract-
ed by a glow of light from ahead a
flood of pure brilliant white light that
welled up from behind the north-
ern horizon in frosty splendor and
as he raced on toward it he knew that
it could be no aurora for it was tak-
ing form as a great perpendicular
ray or beam a gigantic dazzling
beam that seemed to stab straight up
into the zenith swiftly it seemed
growing in brilliance until it had be-
come so blinding to warrens eyes
that he seemed to be flying into a
radiant white sun he was on the
point of swerving to one side to re-
gain his power of sight when there
came with casual abruptness the end

  a blast of wind of tremendous pow-
er struck his plane with a dizzying
shock it spun madly in midair in a
crazy whirl of light and darkness and
then was tumbling swiftly downward
through the darkness of the upper
night as it cometed downward war-
ren with a last instinctive reaction
pulled back the control-stick in his
hands swinging the ships nose up-
ward the next moment the plane
had struck something with a mighty
shock he was flung violently against
the cockpits side and as his head
struck its rim he felt himself catapult-
ed into a sudden flame-lit uncon-
sciousness

how long it was before warren
struggled up from the dark
depths of oblivion he could not esti-
mate he became aware first of hands
upon him touching him hands that
sought to bring him back to conscious-
ness by rubbing wrists and temples
for a moment he lay motionless with
closed eyes and then as remembrance

rushed over him he scrambled to a
sitting position unbelievingly he
stared about him

  he was sitting on a long sandy
beach a beach lit by a steady white
light whose source was somewhere be-
hind him a few yards away long
waves were rippling in against the
beach from a stretch of waters that
extended out into the darkness not
far away he made out the shape of his
own plane drawn up on the sand and
apparently not seriously damaged by
its crash from high overhead came
a keening of powerful winds but
where he sat only a warm balmy
breeze stirred the air and though
someone had stripped from him his
heavy flying-suit he felt uncomfort-
ably warm

  warren stared for a moment in ut-
ter bewilderment unable to connect
his surroundings with the bitter arc-
tic seascape that was his last memory
then abruptly he became aware of a
man kneeling beside him a young
man whose clothing was torn and di-
sheveled and whose face showed
strangely haggard and drawn beneath
the white light that fell upon it he
was gazing at warren with burning
eves and when the airman turned to-
ward him he spoke in a tense whisper

  youre all right he asked i
heard your plane-saw it fall-

  warren raised his arm weakly and
strove to speak this place he
said warm-where am i

  the other laid a swift warning
hand on his lips speak low man
he breathed god knows how near
they are he added in a whisper
turning his eyes from warren and
toward the source of the white light
that fell upon his face warren him-
self turned toward it and then
crouched motionless gazing in sudden
awe for there miles and miles
away blazed the great light he had
seen from his plane a single huge
shaft of frosty white brilliance that
soared straight up into the heavens
looming up like a gigantic pillar of


weird tales

white luminescence stupendous in-
credible paling the stars and throw-
ing a thin ghostly illumination over
all things around him

  warren was silent before the sheer
wonder of the thing his brain reeling
beside him the other was speaking
again you came down on the water
there he was saying and i saw
and pulled your plane up on the beach
here this is corson island

    corson island   repeated the air-
man   it was this place i was trying

to reach and you-

  i am david mcquirk was the
others answer you know of our
expedition  youve heard   

  briefly the canadian explained how
the delights last mysterious message
had aroused the interest of the world
and had resulted in his own attempt
to reach the island by plane when
he had finished the man beside him
was brooding darkly

  so chapman lived to send a mes-
sage he saidhalf to himself god
man if you had but understood
what he was trying to tell you for
while we talk here they are some-
where to the south spreading death
and terror over the nations  

  he was silent for a moment and
when he spoke again it was on a new
thread of thought warmer and
warmer-hour by hour-and the end
comes soon-and all our fault  he
broke off his voice a dry despairing
whisper

  warren felt reason leaving him as
he listened to the others words felt
the stir of warm heavy air around
him where there should have been
only a frozen bitter waste but
abruptly the man beside him was
speaking on his voice low and eager
now

  yet you and i he was saying
even yet we might win if you but

understood-

  he paused for a moment seemed to
struggle for self-control and then
continued in a voice he strove to keep
calm you know already you say

about our expedition and you know
how we came north to find the legend-
ed ruins which angus believed to
exist on this island it was on sep-
tember rd less than three weeks ago
that we got here and beached our
schooner securely on the islands
coast

  it seemed a dreary enough place
covered with the great folds of the
polar ice which had lain upon it for
ages and cowering beneath the bitter
polar cold a desolate frozen desert
we minded its appearance but little
though for we were intent on getting
into the interior and finding the
fabled ruins so our preparations
were rushed and three days after
reaching the island our party with its
motor-sledges started into the in-
terior leaving the schooners officers
and crew aboard the ship

 t am not going to tell now of the
days we spent ranging the
islands interior in search of the place
of ruins a week we spent without
result and it began to seem that aft-
er all the tale was only another base-
less native legend angus himself
was half crazy over the thing by then
utterly unlike the brother i had
known and loved since childhood all
his fanatic scientists soul bent upon
the search though some of us were
convinced by then that our quest was
useless he drove us on and in the end
miles in the islands interior we
found what we sought

  it was at the top of a low ice-
covered mound that our search ended
for there rising out of the ice on the
mounds broad summit were the
great walls of stone just as the eski-
mos had told-cyclopean walls of gray
stone the exposed parts of which were
crumbling from the storms of ages
here and there too were twisted
wrecks of metal beams and girders of
a strange silvery metal that was as
shining and unoxidized as it must
have been when new and at the very
center of the broad summit was the
the polar doom



most enigmatic object of all a large
dome of the same smooth silvery met-
al whose upmost rounded tip only
projected through the ice though we
could faintly glimpse the rest of its
shape through the solid transparent
veil of the ice

  for a time after our discovery of
the ruins angus was like a madman
he was not thinking now of the im-
mense precedent-shattering impor-
tance of our discovery nor of the hon-
ors the world would accord him for
it but was driven on by an intense
overwhelming curiosity-an unholy
euriosity to lay bare whatever secrets
of the long-dead past might lie be-
neath us all his interest was cen-
tered upon the smooth enigmatic
dome whose tip we could see and it
was around this on the morning
after our discovery that we began our
work

  it required but an hours work
with our ice-picks to show us that
excavating the dome in this manner
would be a task of months in the
schooner though were large supplies
of a special chemical compound which
we had brought with us a heat-gener-
ating compound akin to thermit a
small amount of which would give off
enough heat to melt a large volume of
ice so we sent the canadians back
with the motor-sledge to the ship to
procure this dr lowell going with
them when they came back two
days later they were accompanied by
the schooners officers and crew who
had become excited over the news of
our discovery and wished to witness
the excavations although the ship
itself was thus left quite alone it was
securely beached and could come to no
harm

  on the following morning there-
fore we began our work the crew
helping us to scatter the powdered
compound on the iee in a hundred-
foot circle around the domes project-
ing tip and then pouring on it the
igniting acid at once the process
began generating a terrific heat and

swiftly the ice in that hundred-foot
circle melted canals having been cut
to carry away the water as it did so
hour after hour we continued the
process placing more and more of the
compound on the ice until by late in
the afternoon it had eaten down to a
depth of almost twenty feet a great
pit in the ice more than a hundred
feet across out of which rose the dully
gleaming half-cylindrical bulk of the
metal dome itself some twenty feet in
diameter still we kept on until at
last the pit was more than a score of
feet in depth and its floor was brown
frozen earth we had burned our
way directly down through the ice to
the earth beneath

  by that time it was near sunset
and all of us had flocked down the
steps we had cut in the pits icy side
our curiosity mounting to fever heat
what were we to find inside that
metal mystery books or models or
records that would make clear to us
the history of whatever long-dead
race had built it  the sailors and our
three canadians were as interested
now as we ourselves and with the rest
of our party they hung near us in a
little group as angus dr mcgrath
and i advanced upon the dome there
were no openings or sign of openings
in those smooth metal sides and
angus swung up the crowbar in his
hand to sound the metal wall then
abruptly he stopped short while on
every heart there lay for a moment a
cold hand of terror for from inside
the dome which had lain beneath the
iee for ages there had come a sound
-a low muffled sound that was like
the deep note of a muted bell

  we stood quite still gazing at one
another with wild eyes a sick dread
stealing into our souls a tomblike
silence had fallen and still we stood
and stared while northwestward the
crimson descending sun lit up the
whole scene with its weird light
another muted note came from the
domes interior and another and
then quite without warning the wholo


weird tales

metal dome itself suddenly glowed
with misty white light and sent a sud-
den wave of smothering radiant heat
rolling out over us beneath that
warm radiance the pits interior
warmed instantly to a point where we
sweated in our furs while the ice of
its sides began suddenly to melt and
drip there was a silence that must
have lasted for minutes and then in
the domes smooth side a door began
to open

  it opened like no door we had ever
seen before the only thing to which
i can compare it is the opening shut-
ter of a camera-lens a steadily ex-
panding circular aperture one mo-
ment we glimpsed a tiny hole in the
domes metal wall and then the hole
was larger and larger widening out
until it was a circle five feet across at
the walls bottom our eyes dazzled
by the sunlight and the misty light
from the dome itself could not pierce
the darkness of its interior but out
from it came a breath of intensely hot
air and a smell of strange and pun-
gent chemicals which was somehow
terrifying silent motionless we
gazed at that amazing door and
then there was a stir in the darkness
inside it a sound of movement and
through it there came-a thing

  it was a thing out of nightmare a
monstrous incredible thing that filled
us with horror inconceivable stand-
ing less than five feet in height it was
vaguely reminiscent of a toad because
of its spotted back and front skin of
sickly white but the form was not
toadlike not reptilian at all except
for the cold unwinking eyes there
were two short straight lower limbs
seemingly stiff and unjointed and two
short upper limbs which gave the
thing a grotesque manlike appear-
ance the body or trunk of the
thing was smooth dead-white and ex-
cept for the two staring eyes the only
features in its bulbous unhuman head
were close-set ears and a narrow slit
of a mouth which opened and closed
with its breathing there was a

dreadful silence then as we returned
its gaze

ttow long we stared thus i can

  i - not say but i know that the
spell was suddenly broken by a dozen
smothered cries of horror from behind
me as the group in the pit reeled back
while we three nearest the thing
stood rigid a moment only the
group behind me staggered back and
then death was upon them one of
the creatures short arms came up a
silvery tube in its grasp and from
that tube intense red light leapt to-
ward the running men a crimson ray
beneath which they staggered and fell
lay upon the ground in horribly
shrunken little masses of distorted
flesh chapman alone who had been
standing on the steps themselves man-
aged to reach the top of them but
even before he could leap outside and
away from the pit the ray had swung
upward and struck glancingly along
his right side i saw the flesh itself
twisting terribly beneath the ray and
then he was gone i could not at the
time know his fate but i know now
that he must have dragged himself
back to the schooner to send out that
warning message before he died

  all of this had taken but a few
seconds to enact and angus mcgrath
and i still stood motionless the only
ones left alive and waiting in petri-
fied terror for our own death the
toad-creature in the doorway seemed
to regard us its inhuman eyes shift-
ing over us and then it moved toward
us while behind it another appeared
in the doorway

  the sight of that was too much
for mcgrath and with a choking cry
he reeled back ran shakily toward the
pits side before he had gone a doz-
en paces the red ray flashed after him
and in a moment he too lay a dis-
torted thing of cloth and flesh upon
the ground by then others of the
toad-men had emerged from the dome
until there were more than a dozen
of them before us they seemed to
the polar doom



 be regarding us and then we heard
 their speech for the first time a con-
 fused clicking whispering while the
 one nearest us still threatened us with
 his deadly ray-tube then two of the
 others came toward us with metal
 clamps in their hands clamps which
 they fastened upon our wrists and
 ankles tightly we sprawled upon the
 ground prisoners-prisoners of these
 creatures whom we ourselves had re-
 leased from the ice beneath which
 they had slept for ages

 tvuring all this time the dome it-
 - self had continued to glow with
 intense radiant heat and now one of
 the toad-men brought forth from in-
 side it a long hoselike flexible metal
  tube one end of which remained in-
 side the dome while the other ended
 in a flat nozzle this was pointed to-
 ward the icy sides of the pit and
 instantly from the nozzle there sprang
 a broad beam of the same misty light
 and heat which glowed from the dome
 a concentrated ray of radiant heat be-
 neath which the iee crumbled and
 melted instantly within a half-hour
 using this broad ray they had melted
 all of the tons of ice upon the mounds
 summit the waters rushing down its
 slopes in torrents the melting of the
 ice uncovered a waste of shattered
 ruins on the summit and also uncov-
 ered no less than a score of close-
 grouped domes of almost the same
 size as the one beside us

   upon these one by one the broad
 heat-ray was then turned and beneath
 its touch each gave forth the three
 muted notes and then opened like the
 first though none glowed with radiant
 heat as the first had done and from
 the lens-shutter door of each came
 forth some ten to twelve of the toad-
 creatures i saw then that whatever
 apparatus was inside these domes was
 thermostatically operated being auto-
 matically actuated by any heat from
 outside and that it was the heat from
 our ice-melting compound which had
 actuated the apparatus of the first

  by that time complete darkness
had fallen but now the summit of
the mound was illuminated by the
light of the glowing central dome
and the heat from its radiant sides
was so intense that on the summit it
was as warm and balmy as a sum-
mers day while beyond the summit
stretched the great fields of ice-a
tiny oasis of warmth in a desert of
arctic desolation and cold and now
the toad-men more than two hundred
in number became extraordinarily
active bringing forth tools and in-
struments and small complicated
mechanisms from the domes and be-
ginning to link great strips of metal
into a large framework beside us
they stayed always within the heat-
area of the clustering domes though
and a few moments later i saw the
reason for this for one of them
bringing a long metal section from a
dome near the summits edge was
jostled by another and pushed for a
second outside the circle of the glow-
ing heat at once he seemed to quiv-
er spasmodically dropped his burden
and fell and writhed violently on the
ground and then lay still his white
flesh turning swiftly to a deep black
it was apparent that these creatures
died instantly when subjected to ex-
treme cold hence their caution

  the rest paid but little attention
to the mishap of their companion
working on at the great framework
beside us until at last i forgot the
desperateness of our position and
drowsed and slept when i awoke it
was daylight around us but all on the
summit seemed unchanged the toad-
men working on at their metal struc-
ture while we lay pinioned and help-
less watching them once we were
handed a metal container of water
and some hard sticks of brown
fibrous stuff which was their only
food and which we ate hungrily
enough again though after un-
numbered despairing hours i
drowsed away while they worked
and when i awoke sometime during


weird tales

that night i was astounded and
horrified to find that two of the crea-
tures were crouching beside us and
endeavoring to carry on a conversa-
tion with angus who was essaying
to utter some of their own clicking
whispering tones

  it was only then that i learned
that the intensity of our search had
unhinged my brothers mind and
fathomed the depths of his madness
for he told me that he was deter-
mined to throw in his lot with these
toad-men at whose mercy we were
and who were he claimed infinitely
the superiors of man in intelligence
and science all my horror-stricken
remonstrances went for nothing with
him and day after day he spent hours
in learning the murmuring whispers
and clicks of the toad-mens speech
until at last four days after our cap-
ture he had attained to an exchange
of ideas with them and learned for the
first time who and what they really
were

  and it was through him then
that i learned what a horror we had
loosed upon the world these crea-
tures i learned had inhabited earth
eons ago when it was still a warm
steaming ball ages before the fore-
runners of man were born their civi-
lization and their cities had risen in
what was then earths most habitable
portion the regions around the north-
ern pole and on an island in those
regions the island we now call cor-
son island had stood the greatest of
their cities

  theirs was a civilization which
had endured for centuries and which
it seemed could be menaced by no
power on earth but at last it was
threatened with certain destruction
by the greatest of all powers on earth
the southward drift of the great tides
of glacial ice for as the ages passed
ice had formed around the northern
pole little by little and now that ice
began to drift slowly south a majes-
tic resistless white tide which noth-
ing could stand against

  it seemed to mean extinction for
the toad-men since their scientists
predicted that the ice would roll south
until it covered all earth before it
receded and their own bodies in-
ured for ages to the warm steaming
climate of the young earth died in-
stantly when subjected to bitter cold
there seemed no possible escape for
them but at last a plan for escape
was devised a plan which made use
of the biological phenomenon known
as suspended animation

  it is a thing which we know little
enough about now we know that
some animals and insects can remain
without air food or water for great
stretches of time lying in deathlike
sleep until revived to live again we
know too that certain hindoo fakirs
have been buried in earth and let lie
for days then dug up and brought
back to life again one of our own
scientists the great french biologist
berthelot had studied the phenom-
enon and had become convinced that
so long as there is no molecular disin-
tegration the body of any animal
might lie with animation suspended
for unlimited time and live again
when restored from its long sleep
and the scientists of the toad-men had
studied it even more and knew a
process which could induce this liv-
ing death in themselves for unlimited
lengths of time

    it was this secret which they now
used to save their race for it was
their plan to bury themselves and lie
in this deathlike sleep while the ice
rolled south over them and then when
it rolled back tmugh it were centu-
ries later they could rise from that
sleep and again build up their ckies
so on the island of their greatest city
on corson island they constructed
countless strong dome-shaped little
buildings of metal fitted with all
necessary apparatus and scientific
equipment and into each of these
went a certain number of the toad-
men once inside they closed the
wall and released the chemicals which
the polar doom



suspended animation in themselves
and each of these domes was ar-
ranged with thermostatic apparatus
which when the temperature outside
rose again would release other chem-
icals inside that would bring the
sleepers back from their living death
so that when the ice rolled north again
and the polar world warmed once
more the domes would automatically
revive and release the sleeping im-
prisoned hordes inside

     over the island stood these domes
 thousands upon thousands holding
 vast hordes of the toad-men inside
 them and at their center in a score
 of domes grouped close together in a
 special spot were their leaders and
 greatest scientists these were last to
 enter and bring on themselves the liv-
 ing death and when they had done
 so the last of the polar race was safe
 inside the domes and soon above
 them the mighty floods of the polar
 ice rolled south burying the domes
 and the cities of the toad-men beneath
 its frozen tons forging south until it
 covered all earth

then at last the ice began to
recede but it receded only a few
hundred miles north of the arctic
circle and then stopped the domes
and cities of the toad-men it still cov-
ered and so their hordes slept on be-
neath the ice not knowing that their
great plan had failed and as the
ages passed and man vaulted to su-
premacy and to science and power of
his own the polar race slept on be-
neath the ice unconscious like dead
waiting through the centuries in vain
for the receding of the ice which
would awaken and release them

  and then our expedition had
come drawn north by the tale of the
fabled ruins and had released them
t from that first dome through the heat
of our ice-melting compound which
had been sufficient to actuate the
thermostatic apparatus inside releas-
ing the chemicals and awaking the
toad-men from their eon-old sleep and

 releasing too the radiant heat from the
 domes sides which made it safe for
 them to venture outside we had re-
 leased them had loosed a horror out
 of long-dead ages upon the world and
 now they were working to awaken and
 release all their hordes that slept in
 domes beneath the islands ice to
 bring those hordes back into life and
 power and seize the world from man

  it was for that that they were
working on the great mechanism be-
side us for that mechanism was to
be a great heat-magnet a magnet
which would be able to bend and at-
tract heat-vibrations as einstein has
shown that light-vibrations are bent
and attracted by the bodies they pass
in space they would project from
this great magnet a shaft of terrific
force out into space which should
bend and attract and suck down the
vibrations of radiant heat which flood
unceasingly outward through space
from the sun and this concentrated
heat drawn down by the great magnet
upon the island would be of sufficient
intensity to overcome the bitter polar
cold and melt all ice on the island and
in time would raise the temperature
to such a degree of warmth that the
apparatus inside each of the islands
thousands of domes would be actu-
ated that would mean the revival
and release of the hordes inside who
would come forth to seize the world

  it was the plan of the toad-men
too before this happened to flash
south and strike at the present civ-
ilization of man which angus had
described to them a series of mighty
blows which would prevent any
chance of their being interfered with
in their work on the island their
domes themselves were fitted with lift-
ing and propulsion-ray apparatus by
which they could attain terrific speed
and it was in these that they would
venture south first in a small terror-
izing party and then in all their vast
hordes when those hordes had been
awakened

    this was the plan which i heard


weird tales

in helpless horror and then angus
himself told me that he was going to
join forces with the toad-men and help
them all my protestations and en-
treaties had no effect on his crazed
mind and for hours he continued his
whispering speech with our captors
and finally they released him from
his bonds and he began to help them
working with them on the great heat-
magnet mechanism

  that mechanism had taken form
as a giant metal cylinder the connec-
tions from which seemed mostly to
run down into the earth itself set in
its side were its controls a row of
shining little levers like the sema-
phore-controls in a railway signal-
tower and below them was a single
large lever of burnished red metal
swiftly the great mechanism ap-
proached completion until at length
last night it was finished and was
at once put into operation one of the
creatures pressing the small shining
levers in a certain order and then
pressing down the red one

  at once quite noiselessly but with
the swiftness of terrific power there
sprang from the top of the great up-
right cylinder a blinding shaft of
brilliant light stabbing up toward the
stars projecting far out into space
from earth i knew and almost at
once it seemed a flood of radiant
heat rolled down from the shaft and
outward over the island-a flood of
heat sucked earthward by the shaft of
force from the space-speeding heat-
vibrations of the radiant sun itself it
rolled over the island and set the ice-
fields to melting and dripping in a
few minutes while from above came
a shrilling of great winds as the warm
air currents from the shaft drove up
and outward the same currents which
later caught your own plane as it
neared the island and whirled it
down hour followed hour while that
flood of heat from the light-shaft
poured down the toad-men had
snapped off whatever apparatus made
their own central dome glow with

heat apparatus which it alone had
possessed evidently and now they
began to prepare the domes on the
summit for the first sally south

  through all of the next day to-
day they worked angus helping
them and through all the day i
glimpsed from where i lay the ice of
the island melting and running away
while around the mound a vast for-
est of dully gleaming metal domes be-
gan to emerge from the melting ice
by late afternoon all ice on the island
had melted and vanished and there
were wet brown soil and the thousands
of metal domes by that time too
the work of the toad-men on the sum-
mit had ceased and now in their own
domes they rose with whining power
above the island and raced south
flashing the crimson ray upon the
beached schooner as they passed over
it and then speeding on

    i knew upon what mission of
dread they were speeding south and
then at last i knew utter despair
they had left behind them a score or
more for guards angus among them
who were watching now the operation
of the great heat-attractive shaft
above us with each hour the thing
was raising the temperature on the
island higher and soon would be re-
leasing the hordes in the domes
around us my hope had reached its
lowest ebb then when suddenly it
welled up again

  i had glimpsed suddenly a metal
tool one of the workers had dropped
near by-a long thick blade with a
serrated edge cautiously i crawled
toward this and at last had it unno-
ticed by the guards who were clus-
tered beneath the great cylinder
then holding the tool between my
knees i drew the metal clamp that
held my wrists back and forth across
the serrated edge

  slowly toilsomely i worked on at
this ceasing when any of the guards
glanced toward me then working on
it was night by then and with each
minute the warmth of the air around
the polar doom



me seemed to be increasing at last
after an effort that seemed hours in
length the bond that held my hands
gave way and at once i was filing
away at the clamp around my ankles

  within a few more minutes i had
severed this too and then glanced
cautiously toward the guards none
was observing me for the moment so
i quietly slipped back and over the
edge of the mounds summit stealing
down its side and then running fran-
tically through the lanes of metal
domes which lay around me i heard
whispering cries behind me a sudden
clatter of pursuit but ran blindly on
no thought in my head except to ieave
behind me those things of horror who
pursued at last pursuit seemed to
die away and i found myself at the
islands shore and as i reached it i
heard the droning of a motor above
saw your plane spin down into the
water and managed to drag it up onto
the beach

 and now you understand-you
understand the thing that menaces
our world the creatures of hell who
stir and wake to spring upon it for
soon now very soon the waxing
warmth will open the thousands of
domes upon this island revive and re-
lease the hideous hordes inside al-
ready their first attack has gone south
to stagger and stun our world and
once those hordes inside the domes are
loosed they will go south in all their
might annihilate the civilization that
we know and bring earth beneath the
rule of the toad-men for all time



cilence reigned when david mc-
 quirk had ceased to speak-a
silence that was to warrens ears
thunderous on the beach before
them long waves were washing in and
from high above came the whine of
winds but except for these there was
utter stillness then abruptly the
other stood up and the airman did
likewise together without speaking

they gazed toward that shaft of
blinding white light that split the
night ahead

    there is-one chance  david was
saying his eyes fixed upon that col-
umn of frosty brilliance if we
could get to that heat-magnet that
cylinder and destroy or turn it off
such action would stop this increasing
warmth and prevent the domes from
opening it would be a respite at
least but if we do not-

  warren spoke striving to keep his
voice steady if theres a chance
he said theres nothing for it but to
try

  have you any weapon asked
the other and the airman strode to-
ward the plane and drew from its
holster in the cockpit a heavy auto-
matic pistol he hesitated a moment
then handed it to the other you take
it he told him i was always a
rotten shot

  david mcquirk grasped it eagerly
swiftly examining magazine and ac-
tion and then straightened he
glanced once more at the light-shaft
ahead then back to warren and
without speaking the two started off
toward the great beacon that was their
goal

  a thousand feet in from the beach a
dark humped shape loomed before
them and as they strode past it war-
ren saw it for a dome like those david
had described of dully gleaming
metal a thing twenty feet in height
and of equal diameter at its base in-
side it warren knew lay others of the
toad-men sleeping their sleep of ages
but soon to be awakened now unless
their mission succeeded he strode
on after mcquirk

  before them now and on both
sides long rows of the same metallic
dome-structures extended into the dis-
tance and from a slight elevation
which they crossed warren glimpsed
square mile upon square mile covered
with a forest of them realized what
vast hordes must lie within them

several of the heads rolled out

 a ll up and down the coasts of
k the world from the greasy
a jl spoon hard by the street of
a hundred tongues to tampa flor-
ida and aboard the t i  steamers
to indo-china you will hear the
tale always they add a bit to the
telling until now the yarn has be-
come quite interesting who knows
perhaps the story is true any-
jvay-

  beef mullins in gaudy pink shirt
tousled of hair dusky of hide-a
half-breed son of a white beach-
comber who went native where the
big iron wagons make port in
guayaquil-told the tale originally
on the deck of the drifting owl
with the dome over his head


sprinkled by a million glittering
stars with the water lapping
musically against the hull and the
reek of spices oranges and the
sweet-scented fruit blossoms drift-
ing out from the tropical forests of
ecuador

  the expedition which the drifting
owl had carried down from two
thousand miles north had gone into
the interior to search-to buy for
daniel j hack their employer-
some gruesome awe-inspiring orna-
ments for hacks amusement enter-
prises the ornaments these men
hoped to buy from the jivaro natives
were small shriveled-up dried
human heads
the head from ecuador



  while the hunters were away dan
hack remained behind with beef
mullins skipper griswold and sev-
eral others

  a full week had gone by and noth-
ing had been heard from the expedi-
tion in the hills back aft the yel-
low cook was fingering a one-
stringed chinese fiddle down here
under the lazy warmth of the tropics
the music sounded more super-
natural than it does in the opium
dens of chinatown the mascot
dog shaggy and flea-bitten urged by
the squeak of tre fiddle pointed his
nose toward the silver orb of a moon
and howled-aye just as his fore-
father the wolf with his tail be-
tween his legs howled for his mate
hundreds of years before the slow
change to dogdom probably this
was the real reason why the dog
howled but skipper griswold saw
something else in the mascots ac-
tions

  aye growled the skipper cast-
ing a glance in the direction of the
fiddling chinese somebodys goin
to die

  bah you believe in that rot
sneered a scrawny-necked chicago
gutter rat who was making his first
trip to sea as a mess-boy

  dogs now continued the skip-
per as though he had not heard the
interruption of the scrawny-necked
one dogs now can see things that
we poor mortals can only guess at
sometimes i think they can see
across the border-line of death have
you ever noticed how a dog will
stop suddenly growl put his tail be-
tween his legs and slink at his mas-
ters heels when his owner can see
no apparent reason for his actions
what does the dog see

  yeh said beef mullins feeling
in his shirt pocket for cigarette
makings yeh dogs is funny crea-
tures now if as you say someone
is going to die who is that some-
one

  beef stopped shifted himself to a

more comfortable position on the
overturned water-bucket and looked
through squinted eyes at hack who
was patrolling abaft the forward
deck always looking out toward the
shore-line as though he was anxious
to catch sight of an approaching
party-a party which had been in
the hills of ecuador for more than
a week now

  him maybe eh asked beef
jerking his head in the direction of
dan hack i dont know exactly
why i should think th dog howls
for him but-

  the dusky-faced sailor held the
flare of a match to his cigarette
the light cast a glow over the seams
and wrinkles the skipper saw the
nerves twitching in the sailors neck
as he sucked on the white paper
column

  yeh said beef flicking the
match stick over the rail yeh hes
a queer chap this daniel j hack
hes a regular he-devil if you know
what i mean his morals are all
twisted up theys only two things
in dans brain his shows and how
to make them pile up dollars and
asia amerilla the girl who went
out with the expedition hes got
heaps of money but he aint got
asia-not yet he aint but im
afeered aye mightily afeered that
dan will have her yet unless that
dog knows what he is howling for

  moanin what asked skipper
griswold you been with th own-
er o this tub for a long while aint
you

  yeh i ought to know i been
knowin dan hack ever since he
lugged hay for th bulls in th gold-
en gate circus then th shows be-
longed to warbler gobet and dan
hack coveted them-i dunno now
i dunno about that dog maybe he
does know what hes howlin for
listen

  th whole thing started back
there in toledo ohio when warbler
gobet a smile on his face and a


weird tales

hole in his pocket-both quite
natural for the warbler-came up
out of nowheres to take charge of
th golden gate shows

nrhis here circus what im tell-
in you about aint nothin
more than a few wild animals pac-
in back and forth in gaudily paint-
ed cat-wagons a pile of blue trunks
and a lot of dirty canvas with per-
formers driftin in from th four
quarters of th globe to start south
with her

  we came rags and patches silks
and satins spangles and cheese-
cloth and dumped our baggage at
th warblers feet we found him
on th lot with his high patent-
leather boots covered with toledo
mud his big hat was pulled down
even with th range of his eyes th
wind whipped th crimson scarf
which was knotted loosely about his
neck and jerking his brass-knot-
studded belt a bit higher he smiled
-smiled in the face of a hard hard
world thats why they called him
warbler for his lips puckered up
and he started to whistle away his
troubles

   carry your outfit in a bag
eh he said to professor ellowell
williams-th lord only knows why
he called himself professor or where
he ever found such a peculiar name
for listen he was an indian i
know for the same blood runs in
my veins

   yes answered th professor
his voice was not bad to listen to
he had learned much in th white
mans school yes the best-paying
bet on the lot replied the profes-
sor suddenly dumping the bags
contents on the ground

 gosh exclaimed dan hack
eyeing the terrible objects he was
th only person there who did not
step back and grimace at th hor-
rible things he seemed fascinated
where did they come from

   ah my friend dried heads

they came from the jungles of
ecuador the indian head-hunters
bring down their game human
game with blow-guns pouf just
so th professor guy makes a
circle with his fingers puckers up
his lips and illustrates his meaning
pouf just like that interesting
eh

  humph grunted hack he
stood there for a long while looking
at the heads little aint they

   yes shrunken hot sand and
pebbles are placed inside the head
after the nape of the neck has been
slit and the skull removed then-
ah then it is turned over and over
for days patiently lovingly the
jivaro does his work slowly until
it has been-what you call it in
english -cured  

 hack moved from one foot to
th other raised his cap scratched
his head with his little finger and
allowed his eyes to travel over th
little company of performers who
had collected he noted asia
amerilla with her knees pulled
almost to her chin sos to be as far
away as possible from th gruesome
objects asia was-well you know
shes a beauty youve seen her

 right then and there trouble
started at first sight of asia ameril-
la three men decided they could not
live under th same big top without
owning her-now skipper you knows
as well as beef mullins that they
aint never one woman made sos she
could be divided twixt three men-
aint nowise possible me i just
watched what happened

  th golden gate entrained im-
mediately we were billed through
th south with our objective at
tampa florida where th warbler
intended goin into winter quarters
everything went lovely until we
reached asheville north carolina
money rolled into th box office
and th sun seemed bent on lighting
up our path never saw so many
days without rain in all my life we
the head from ecuador



were always one jump ahead of th
rainstorms professor ellowell wil-
liams dried heads were th biggest
card on th bill he collected a quar-
ter at his side shows for every half-
dollar that went via th main en-
trance to th big top and warbler
gobet-well th warbler couldnt
stand prosperity

  warbler gobet arrived perched on
top of a property wagon whistlin
and wobblin from side to side as th
six-horse team tugged at th team-
sters handful of lines gobet was
drunk hed been drunk ever since
we left th ohio river

  th tents were up in all their
snowy whiteness and while th war-
bler snored in a pile of canvas behind
th cook tent arrangements were be-
in made for th night performance

 asia amerilla had asked dan
hack to pull up th slack in her guy
lines i happened along just as th
professor approached th girl

   asia have you decided to give
me an answer asked the exhibitor of
dried heads

   no really professor ive for-
gotten all about the matter it would
be well if you did the same 

   but asia i love you- start-
ed th professor again he placed a
hand on her arm dan hack looked
up from his work with a murderous
scowl on his face it would have
been well had ellowell williams con-
sidered dan hacks presence

   and i-i do not love you be-
sides you are a nig-nig-indian
exclaimed th  girl

  but asia-

   say exploded hack straight-
ening up from his work and stepping
forward fists doubled in a threatening
manner if youre a nigger you cut
it out do you know what happens to
black men who look too hard on white
women in this country

  th professor was fumblin for
his knife i saw thgleam of its blade
as his hand moved from his hip dan

stepped back and reached for his own
weapon

   listen you low-lifed scum
yelled williams his voice high-
pitched and th muscles twitchin in
his neck im an indian ill admit
that-aye and if this woman will
admit so much she too is of my na-
tivity-

   he lies the beast lies
screamed th girl leaping at th pro-
fessor her fingers crooked talonlike
a veritable tigress her white teeth
showing anthblood poundinin her
temples

  me now beef mullins aint goin
to stand quietly by and see men carve
each other i steps in and smooths
things over both men stood staring
at each other for a moment then-

   ah you scum ill have your
head in my bag some of these days
yelled williams as he moved away
shaking his fist at hack

  hack smiled-a cruel smile that
burned deep into th  soul of th indian
-aye i beef mullins know for
aint i felt th stir of jivaro blood
racin through my veins at th insults
of white men

   i am sorry we are not in the
oriente  like vitriol the words
dropped from th indians lips id
add your head to those in the bag-
el diablo

 t had occasion to go out back of th
cook tent later that evening i
leaned against a wheel of th gilted
band wagon picked my teeth with a
straw and watched silently like th
very shadows themselves i watched

  dan hack came he passed be-
hind th cook tent and looked upon th
circus owner who was sprawled on his
bed of canvas one leg drawn up and
a half-empty whisky bottle clutched
in his hand gobet moved his legs
drew th bottle up until it almost
touched his lips then-as though th
effort was too great-th fingers re-


weird tales

laxed and th bottle slid over th can-
vas mounds side

  this seemed to amuse dan hack
he laughed his hands in his pockets
and his feet spread wide he threw
back his head and bellowed gleefully

   you drunken fool whispered
dan to th unhearin circus owner
im not half bad-looking but im
only a circus roustabout-feeder of
elephants cleaner of pens-which
makes you ace-high with asia aye
but ill change all that ill have
your shows before we reach tampa

  dan did not have long to wait for
his chance at warbler gobets shows
it was only two hours later while th
people were driftin toward th exits
from th big top saturday night
pay day the next day being sun-
day-in keeping with warbler gobets
religious belief-th shows would
spend th day on th lot there were
a lot of little things about warbler
gobet which eaused men to like him
he was rough tough-but th war-
bler knew god

  tonight there were canvasmen in
muddy overalls cooks in undershirts
performers still wearin their tights
and spangles clowns who had not yet
washed th grease-paint from their
faces all yearnin to take a hand in
th poker game which was sure to
follow close on th heels of th ghost
of pay day coins of all denomina-
tions were heaped in th center of th
table in th cook tent those who
could not find room on th long wood-
en benches leaned over th other play-
ers shoulders

  th circus owners whistle was
heard outside they could hear his
stumblin feet and th commotion
when he sprawled headlong over th
guy-lines and stakes several of th
men leaped to their feet to go to his
assistance but they heard his whistle
-th same which brought him th
name of warbler-and they knew he
wasnt injured

   oh ho he roared as he parted
th tent flaps his red neck-searf was

untied his checkered vest was but-
toned only at th lower hole his hat
was crushed and dirty and he wore
only one boot  oh ho a game and
im not in it make room boys let
th king o stud sit in

  they made room for him at th
head of th table with much laughter
then th game progressed soon th
coins in th center of th table were
mixed with a scatterin of bills and
there were not so many players left
during th momin hours one after
th other of th  men dropped out and
left warbler gobet playin with th
man at th opposite end of th table

   gettin late mister gobet re-
marked this man at th opposite end
of th table from gobet this gentle-
man shuffled th cards in a practised
manner slithering them fan-shape
before him

  why hack youre winnin
aint you asked gobet who was not
near so drunk as he had been

  both men had been making heavy
bets th money was all goin one
way-to dan hacks pile th war-
bler saw th receipts of th ticket
wagon slidin toward his opponent

  somethins wrong mumbled
gobet somethins wrong old-timer
you just naturally cant have such
luck-square luck

  th circus owner moved down th
length of th table hack moved
across to th  other side so they might
face each other

 with this last move dan hack
seemed to lose his confidence maybe
he thought it unlucky to move to
another seat

   wed better stop now mister
gobet suggested hack he coughed
nervously

   aint broke yet mister hack
im bettin you-im bettin you-
gobet looked at his cards-im
bettin you my shows all one big
bet my shows-lock stock and
the head from ecuador



barrel th center pole thrown in-
against th pile at your elbow

 warbler gobet now perfectly
sober leaned across th table and
glared into dan hacks eyes dans
lips were dry and he ran his tongue
out rapidly-like a snake

   its gettin late mister gobet
and-and-

  hack ran his fingers through his
hair looked about at th few watchers
who were left glanced at his pile of
money

 gus vance boss canvasman
stepped forward as though he would
interfere th professor-oh he was
there-placed his hand on th can-
vasmans arm and shook his head

  	  come on you yellow hound-my
shows against your money 

  th warbler scribbled a bill of
sale on an old paper bag and tossed it
into th pot

  hack smiled-a pitiful weak sort
of a smile he shoved his pile over
alongside th bill of sale

 warbler gobet drew one card
and knew immediately that he was no
longer owner of th golden gate cir-
cus unless dan hack held a mighty
rotten hand all th circus owner
had was an odd lot of cards with th
nine of clubs for high

 hack placed his cards on th
table face up-he had three aces

   now mister gobet if youre
lookin for a job im sure gus vance
can find a place for you among his
roustabouts said hack leaning for-
ward to scoop in th  pot

   no thank you mister hack im
going back where i came from im a
fish for drink when im prosperous
i gamble and i cuss otherwise im
just half and half when i die ill
likely find it hard to get into heaven
because i never did anything par-
ticularly good they will not let me
in hell because i never did anything
particularly bad you now you
need not worry about th devil open-
ing his gates for you youve been
plain lucky on this last deal not so

with all th hands which went before
its a wonder th boys will let you
live when they learn your method of
play i saw to it that this last hand
was square and so youre welcome to
th shows i hoped to win back what
you had taken from th boys i
caught you just before you dealt this
last hand-thats why i moved

  with this warbler gobet walked
to th far end of th cook tent took
down th cooks mirror and smashed it
into many pieces on th table-top
then he bowed himself out at th
door that was th last any of us
saw of warbler gobet thats how
dan hack came to be a promoter of
amusement enterprises

  it is needless to say that dan
hack did not allow th shows to stay
on th lot over sunday to th new
owner sunday was just another day
he made us pull stakes and entrain
for th next jump

reefin south along th seaboard

   air line several days later pro-
fessor ellowell williams made a last
desperate attempt to spoil dan hacks
chances of gaining asia amerilla as
an addition to his success

  th train had stopped among th
everlastin pines to allow th brake-
man to pack a hot-box on a sleeper
we-dan hack myself and others-
were swappin yams of th road back
aft in a half-filled baggage car sud-
denly an enraged tigress cat-asia
amerilla-leaped among us

  look look she screamed
see what that fiend did

   where is he yelled hack mak-
ing for th door

   wait-hes gone theres no use
trying to catch him by this time he
has lost himself among the saw grass
and swamps while i was asleep in
my berth he crept in pricked the flesh
of my arm with a knife blade-a blade
steeped in a poisonous derivative of
curare a deadly poison used by the
indians of ecuadors interior then
when his work was finished he fed me


weird tales

salt and i recovered to see him escap-
ing

    the girl was in tears now me i
knew-oh i knew for have i not seen
the indian nse th deadly dart in th
forests of ecuador salt plain salt
is th only thing which will counter-
act its action th indian shoots
monkeys with darts previously poi-
soned th little animal falls from th
tree th  indian captures him and im-
mediately feeds salt th result is a
live monkey sometimes they poison
th streams to catch fish-oh i know
i do

 th professor had tattooed a
peculiar set of marks across asias
forehead his purpose evidently was
to spoil th girls attractiveness

   tell dan he can have you now
since i have spoiled your beauty
was what asia said he had called as
he leaped for th pines bordering th
railway tracks as though dan hack
could ever have me  she finished

 we aint never seen nothin of
th  professor since then neither have
we run afoul of warbler gobet dan
hack split th golden gate into nu-
merous shows that go north east
south and west every season and th
money lias piled up for him he
hasnt yet been able to induce asia to
accept him

  th marks on th girls forehead
do not change her beauty to any
great extent you saw that before she
left with th expedition

 now gus vance had pointed out
to dan hack that th loss of professor
ellowell williams and his dried heads
was a blow to th success of th
golden gates side shows dan de-
cided that an expedition into ecuador
for some of these heads would prove
profitable therefore here we are on
th deck of this old tub hard by th
coast waitin and watchin for th
expeditions return while th danged
dog howls to th tune of th chinese
cooks one-stringed fiddle

 aye sang skipper griswold
aye howls for th death o someone

 im tellin you someones goin to
 die

 nphe little crowd collected about
 beef mullins became hushed
 they looked up to find dan hack ap-
 proaching his face wore a worried
 expression

   skipper do you think my men
 will have a hard time getting the
 heads dan asked

   well i dunno bout that an-
 swered the captain tearing his ration
 from a plug of tobacco with his yel-
 low teeth sometimes its mighty
 hard to make th natives part with
 em then again theyll sell emselves
 for a good rusty gun was a time

	when head-huntin was a sport with
 th jivaros now its a business
 they discovered that th white man
 would trade guns for em so a fel-
 lers got to mind his eye if he dont
 want to lose his head

   theys a story floatin round as
 how a man was dead sot on gettin a
 head with red hair this gent offered
 a good price as a reward for such a
 head and a little sawed-off runt of
 an irishman-or mebbe he was
 dutch or italian i dunno-he went
 back for th head his stay was
 mighty long and th boss got sort o
 peeved about havin to wait so long
 for that red-haired head

   finally when th boss had about
 given up ever hearin from th red-
 headed head-hunter a native came in
 with a head for sale it had red hair
 and-bless your soul-it was th  red-
 headed head-hunters head itself

   hack started to join the rest in
 laughter at this tale suddenly he
 thought of something and although
 his mouth was open and the wrinkles
 of laughter already formed no sound
 came across his lips a look of horror
 crept into his eyes

   i say captain griswold theyve
 been gone now almost a month im
 rather anxious about the girl who
the head from ecuador



went back with them i wonder-oh
pshaw i suppose shes all right

  i dunno i dunno mr hack them
jivaros are a mighty cunnin lot ive
heam tell as how they got th call o
monkeys down so pat that they call
th little man-animals down out o th
hills so they can shoot em with their
blow-guns ida heap rather be safe
and sound aboard my ship than ca-
hootin round among them jungles
after that hack became exceeding-
ly nervous he ran to the rail to look
every time a boat put out and fol-
lowed the skipper around at all hours
of the day and night asking questions
about the head-hunters

within a few days word was
brought by a half-naked native
that the expedition was approaching
not long after this they came aboard
the ship ragged sunburned and thin
after their sojourn in ecuador asia
was not with them dan feared to ask
about her he ran to the rail shaded
his eyes and looked out toward the
shore without even greeting the newly
arrived expedition

  well dan said gus vance who
had headed the buyers of heads
weve had fairly good luck

  gus pointed to the bales coming
aboard in the slings

  did you get the heads asked
dan absent-mindedly

  dan looked about him as though he
still expected to see asia among them

  yes think we got enough and we
only lost one of the party   answered
gus running his big red bandana
handkerchief over his hot face

  gus gus who was lost not
asia dan hack was almost in
tears his lips trembled and his hands
shook as he fingered his chin

  now dont fly off the handle
dan little things like that cant be
helped yes it was asia

  dead asked hack hardly above
a whisper

  i dont know either that or else
she has turned native we went into

a village to do some trading and she
just dropped out by the way we
met an old friend of yours in that
same village-professor ellowell wil-
liams only he dont go by that name
any more he sold us several heads  

  gus kicked a bale to indicate the
heads he had reference to and then
stood watching what happened

  the members of the expedition
crowded around while dan fell to his
knees on the deck and began to tear
frantically at the cloth and wicker
covering of the bales

  he soon made an opening it was
his property he had paid well for it
no one interfered several of the
heads rolled out he examined them
closcly until he found one with un-
usually light hair a rawhide strap
fastened to the back long cotton
cords sewed through the lips to hang
like a beard this one had peculiar
marks tattooed in the forehead-the
same marks that professor ellowell
williams had pricked in the flesh
while asia was under the influence
of the mystical indian poison

  it was the end of all things for dan
hack to him asia was the greatest
thing in the world the realization
that his own head-hunters had
brought back the head of the woman
he loved was more than the amuse-
ment promoter could bear his brain
went back on him

  not a member of the expedition will
forget the scream which dan hack ut-
tered and the crazy words he babbled
the dog leaped to the poop deck and
began his unearthly howling the
chinese cook arms hidden in his bag-
gy calico sleeves came shuffling for-
ward to see what the commotion was
over

  look out yelled beef mullins
grab him someone

  dan hack was scrambling up the
shrouds before they could stop him
before they realized what he was
about and he was soon in the rigging
he called for asia cursed his crew
prayed to his god tore his hair and


weird tales

beat his breast like a monkey who has
lost her young shook his fist at the
howling dog and then leaped far out
and away from the rigging into the
sea

teef mullins aided by others of
-- the crew put forth in a small
boat they returned half an hour
later to report that dan hack could
not be found

  consam that dog exclaimed
beef mullins shaking his fist at the
dog who was slinking toward the gal-
ley with his tail between his legs

  aye i told you so chimed the
captain

  well ill be- started gus

vance he scratched his head
thoughtfully as he looked at the heads
scattered over the deck   i wonder if
dan mistook that for asias head
why confound it that is only ello-
well williams private mark he puts
it on all the heads he takes-just as a
man places his stamp on soap wrap-
pers as a trade-mark

  beg your pardon sir spoke up
a sailor who had been one of the party
who had gone back into the interior
with the expedition i think this
chap hack has been fooled all around
i know where asia is she found her
husband back there in the jungles on
the same mission as our own i think
this fellow ellowell williams called
him warbler gobet this williams
party tells me as how some crook flim-
flammed asias husband out of his
shows and that she was engaged in
milking the flim-flammer of some of
his ill-gained wealth before he found
out that she was married in the
meantime this gobet chap had been
hunting up odds and ends-among
them some dried heads-with which to
start a new show

  gosh mumbled beef mullins
throwing his cigarette stub into the
sea i always thought warbler go-
bet and this asia girl were kinda
thick-anyways a dog sure does
know when someones gonna die
aye aye answered captain
griswold

a story of the fire-lvorshipes

flame of the
ages

by robert choate albright

shabad nagaur high priest	of the ancient temple more than a

of the fire temple of oudh	foot upward it mounted suffusing all

knelt in silence before the altar	about it with a dull red glow
of the parsees incense of a nauseat- such was the soul of ormuzd god

ing sweetness smoldered on the sacred	of the guebres for eons it had

shrine a ruby-red flame burned	burned thus-since the beginning of

steadily in a bronze bowl directly in	time itself shabad had been taught

front of the kneeling priest casting	to believe and why should he doubt

its roseate light on the blackened walls	traditions which had been carried
flame of the ages



down to him by generations of the
holiest of mortals high priests of the
temple of oudh  had he not proved
himself an apt pupil to the venerable
sherhazur his predecessor

  while yet a lad shabad had learned
by heart the zend-avesta the holy
book of the parsees and had startled
his teacher with his grasp of the vohu
mano and the akem mano before
many years had passed old sherhazur
had been unable to answer his ques-
tions and had sent the boy to other
temples that his thirst for knowledge
might be satisfied it was no wonder
therefore when the aged sherhazur
passed away that shabad nagaur
the boy prophet was made priest
in his stead

  far into the night shabad knelt in
silence before the altar of the parsees
gazing intently at the ruby flame the
soul of the good deity ormuzd he
must always gaze thus except at brief
intervals when other priests of the
temple of oudh took his place at the
altar for was it not written in the
zend-avesta that ahriman the evil
deity always hovered near waiting
for the holy men to relax their vigil 
what would happen then shabad for
all his knowledge did not know
three things alone concerned him-
he was the high priest of ormuzd
he must guard his shrine against
ahriman he must watch the flame
it had been burning since the be-
ginning of time it must burn until
the end his ancestors had protected
it despite the persecutions of the
persians throughout the bloody on-
slaughts of calif omar they had
nourished it driven into exile they
had carried it with them into india
and built for it the temple at oudh
and there it flamed before him the
fire symbol of ormuzd

  but the priest of the parsees is
human and being the wisest and
most learned of his race shabad
passed moments when he doubted
many things-doubted even the ten-
ets of his own religion it was his

wont to pass such thoughts off light-
ly attributing them to the temptation
of ahriman the evil one but this
night he dared to reflect longer than
usual upon the fate which had placed
one so learned as he to watch a little
flame for the rest of his days even
though that flame be the symbol of
the good deity ormuzd

  perhaps shabad sank too deeply
into revery perhaps the thickness of
the incense made him strangely
drowsy for his eyes closed and his
head fell forward upon his breast
kneeling before his altar the high
priest of oudh fell fast asleep

when shabad awoke it was with
the realization that all was dark
in the temple the sacred fire no
longer flamed before him a terrible
fear gripped his heart dazed he
groped his way to the altar the
bronze bowl was there but it was
cold cold for the first time in all of
the centuries

  the high priest fell prostrate to the
floor and lay there trembling he
wondered why the walls of the temple
did not tumble in upon him why
did ahriman not strike him down
but no ahriman would not strike
him down ahriman must regard
him with favor for had he not
through his own wanton carelessness
destroyed a faith which was as old as
the world itself had he not de-
stroyed the soul of ormuzd

  shabad cursed the day he had been
bom-cursed himself for ever taking
the holy vows better that long
since he had been stretched in death
upon the temple of silence where
the sacred vultures come each day to
pick the flesh from the parsee dead
and the bones fall one by one through
the grating into the vault below

  reason told the high priest that
ahriman had not extinguished the
flame it had gone out he told him-
self because of his own stupid fail-
ure to replenish the bowl with sacred
oil had he but kept his vigil he


weird tales

might have saved the ruby fire but
no he had fallen asleep like a drunk-
en low-caste he pondered on the
consequences of his fateful blunder
what would his people do now that
the faith of their fathers was taken
from them destroyed by their most
trusted guardian of the temple
must they now seek another creed
must they become hateful mohamme-
dans buddhist fools or christian
dogs shabad shuddered to think of
it

  it was then that the thought came
to him why should they ever know
it would be a simple matter to add
oil to the bowl and rekindle the flame
the parsees trusted him they would
never suspect what had taken place
they would come to the temple as
of old and offer up sacrifices to the
sacred fire which alas was no longer
sacred they would never know
that the soul of ahriman burned in
the flame in the place of the good
deity ormuzd

  shabads conscience rebelled had
he high priest of the parsees fallen
so low would he thus make mock
of the religion of his fathers he
sobbed audibly what must he do
he dared not think of the wrath of
his people when they found that the
soul of ormuzd no longer burned in
the bowl of bronze they would
curse him spit upon him and drive
him from the temple they would
do more than that they would tear
out his heart and throw his body to
the vultures on top of the tower of
the dead

  the high priest raised himself to
his knees and listened intently all
was silent as death slowly he made
his way through the darkness to the
rear of the shrine where with fum-
bling hands he opened a small door at
the base of the altar he drew from
the covert a torch which he lighted
carrying the taper and a small urn
he returned to the front of the altar
swiftly he filled the bronze bowl with
oil from the urn and applied the

torch the light sputtered a moment
then leapt to full height

  shabad fell on his knees before the
shrine his body trembled convul-
sively and it seemed his heart would
burst for a few moments he
struggled to gain control of himself
the deed was done beyond retraction
he reasoned he must not falter now
raising his head he called softly the
name of the priest who each morning
took his place before the altar
kotah he called again in a
voice higher pitched he chanted
kotah

  a rustling of robes was heard in a
near-by corridor and a priest ap-
peared he salaamed three times as
he approached shabad returned the
salutation and with burning eyes
searched the others face   could ko-
tah know he asked himself but if
the priest had suspicions his face did
not betray them he took his place be-
side shabad before the shrine and
together they chanted a verse from
the zend-avesta to the glory of
ormuzd it seemed to shabad that
he saw the hateful face of ahriman
grinning at him from the bowl

  their devotions over the high priest
arose and went out of the room
leaving kotah to guard the shrine

as the sun rose to its fullest height
in the heavens that morning the
holy men of the temple of oudh were
in a high state of alarm though
they had searched every comer and
crevice of the temple their high
priest shabad nagaur could not be
found finally one of them noticed
the vultures circling in great num-
bers above the temple of silence
the priest thought it strange for
there had not been a death in oudh
for a fortnight climbing to the top
of the tower he found shabad
stretched upon the grating his right
hand clutching the handle of the
sacrificial knife he had plunged its
golden blade deep into his heart
william-a-

over him they crawled a veritable army of the
bloated venomous creatures

the whole affair from its con-
ception was extraordinary a
strange adventure into an un-
known region of the world a strange
discovery and a strange conclusion
it had no equal in any fiction that i
knew and the actors were like char-
acters in a drama

  of mrs seton i had learned much
nowadays when one reaches that
indeterminate age which really tact-
ful people designate as over
thirty one doesnt fold ones hands
and settle down to a grave dignified
old age the modern woman refuses
to grow old it was not denied that
clara seton was beautiful her eyes

sparkled with the fire of life she
had not lost that priceless charm of
youth prom a girl red-blooded
daring eager for a life of constant
thrills and excitement she had ma-
tured only to crave even more the
popularity admiration and applause
that follow the victorious participa-
tion in certain fascinating events

  but it was graves in whom i was
interested i knew mrs seton had
long been infatuated with him as
he chatted with her in the lobby i
went outside and waited i did not
want to lose him i had met him in
france and there was something

about him-he had been one of us

                                 


weird tales

he came out walking rapidly and
was well past the hotel when i
caught up with him he stopped
and looked at me patiently while i
was trying to think of something to
say but i hesitated and he walked
on i kept up with him and finally
suggested we might dine together
my idiotic mumble seemed to please
him he surprized me by accepting
i dont pretend i understood him
his views were not mine-yet in the
end he rang true

  graves with seton and his wife
had gone into south america on
some hare-brained rumor of a lost
civilization a philadelphia museum
had sent them as a scouting party
that could move swiftly and cover
the ground if they found what they
sought an elaborate expedition
could go in later equipped to meet
the conditions that existed

  graves and mrs seton had re-
turned-alone they brought back
some story of spiders at least mrs
seton did and graves corroborated
her yet i knew seton to be a reliable
man painstaking and methodical
in the field this i had learned
from the museum i had only met
him twice myself he was older than
his wife and of a more quiet bear-
ing and there was a noticeable dif-
ference between them there had
been talk too breath of scandal
but their story had been accepted
by all-except the museum

  i knew mrs seton was in love
with graves or pretended to be
since their return they had often
been seen together on one occasion
as i was leaving the apartments
where graves was staying i heard
a soft rustling on the stairs-inti-
mately feminine there in a dark-
ened corner of the landing she cow-
ered a slim figure in a clinging
silken gown her hat shadowed her
face but could not hide its startling
beauty could not mar the brilliance
of her skin nor dim the wonderful
eyes of this modem delilak

  i paused and looked at her sharp-
ly as she took a step forward her
eyes filled with defiance her lips
parted

  oh she panted why dont
you let us alone

  it is with some shame that i con-
fess her charm almost enveloped me
like a magic cloud her beauty was
wholly intoxicating but i had
thrust her away

  you have no claim to mercy i
replied unfeelingly do not count
upon any i left her pale and
trembling

  i had returned to the states short-
ly after the collapse of the ill-fated
party and was staying at the jef-
ferson house graves dined with me
there he talked soberly with a sort
of composed unreserve and quiet
bearing that might have been the
outcome of manly self-control or of
gigantic deception who could tell
he seemed of the right sort and he
had been one of us

xe left guayaquil he spoke
slowly in answer to my ques-
tion and went down into the dis-
puted territory of northern peru
toward the end of that semi-arid
plateau which stretches for miles be-
tween two spurs of the peruvian
andes lies a land that god forgot
high in the air it is as men measure
things-a matter of two vertical
miles above the slow lift of the pa-
cific out beyond the sunset tumbled
and stark too a dumping-ground of
the titans a scrap-heap from which
the world was made

  up toward this sky-top world we
rode on a day as glittering and tel-
escopically clear overhead as it was
harsh and soggy underfoot up
through the green rankness of the
jungle coast toward a land of il-
limitable space to the condor
swinging a thousand feet overhead
we must have seemed like ants crawl-
the cave of spiders



mg in single file toward a rugged
border

  that night we camped in a ra-
vine on a little grassy flat protected
on two sides by the crumbling walls
of the cut we were not yet out of
the jungle and the surrounding wil-
derness with its screams of winged
creatures and its dank tropical
odors was in direct contrast to the
country above where the mountains
swept up and up into a cap of the
clouds  

  graves paused the marble floor
in the middle of the dining-room was
filled with dancing couples whirling
around in a flash of colors to the
strains of voluptuous music emanat-
ing from among the gilt and bro-
cades where a concealed orchestra
played unceasingly one wondered
who they were and where they all
came from these expensively
dressed apparently refined though
only veneered girls whirling about
with the pleasant est-looking young
men who expertly guided them
through the mazes of the one-step
and waltz and a dozen other steps
that i knew not of all around us
the atmosphere seemed vibrant with
laughter and music but it went
unheeded we were in a different
world

  my companion looked at me doubt-
fully as he lit a cigarette he seemed
perplexed as if he was about to make
some extraordinary statement some-
thing i eould not imagine or believe

  that night he shot out oc-
curred a strange thing

  we had built a huge fire in the
opening of our rocky shelter that
any prowling animals might be kept
at bay beyond the fire yellow-green
spots of flame appeared moved about
restlessly disappeared and reap-
peared accompanied by hideous
growls and screams as the hungry
beasts and screeching night birds
were attracted by the light of our
campfire

  but to such things we had be-

come calloused we talked uncon-
cernedly as we might have done in
more domesticated surroundings
the fire crackled cheerily the own-
ers of the yellow-green eyes raised
their frightful chorus to the heavens

  suddenly the moon which had
been shining brightly was obscured
by a cloud darkness enclosed us
like a shroud and then as though
the hand of death had reached out
and touched us we all tensed into
rigidity being frozen by some
strange species of terror or awe
above the diapason of the teeming
forest we heard a dismal flapping of
wings and overhead through the thick
night a shadowy form passed across
the diffused light of the flaring camp-
fire i felt a strange creeping sensa-
tion run over my flesh as the horrible
something flapped itself across the
sky an eery wail floated down from
above and the apparition whatever
it might have been was swallowed
up by the darkness for several
minutes we heard the sounds of those
dismally flapping wings lessening in
the distance until they could no
longer be heard

  i glanced toward seton who was
gazing into the darkness above he
mumbled something about a vampire
bat and walked toward the tent with
an air of finality clara was still
silent but when i turned to her i
found her big eyes fixed upon me
with an expression in which there
was pleading in which there was
something else-something indefin-
able yet strangely disturbing

   it is a sign she said slowly
someone is going to die

  though i dont think i am any
more cowardly than the average
man i wasnt feeling any too com-
fortable that night the very atmos-
phere seemed charged with some-
thing sinister secret and malign
forces seemed to throb about us-
forces against which we had no
armor as clara seton spoke i felt
as one bound upon an aztec altar


weird tales

with the priests obsidian knife
raised above my breast

  vaguely i remembered seeing
clara to her own tent and after pil-
ing more wood upon the fire falling
exhausted upon my own cot beside
seton there are few states i sup-
pose which exact so severe a toll
from ones nervous system as the
anticipation of calamity and it
came soon enough

  i studied the mans face attentive-
ly he was at least candid but it
never came home to him how wholly
he was caught in the spell of this
woman whose real character was so
inscrutable whose beauty and charm
masked the cunning of a serpent

  i watched him light a fresh ciga-
rette and exhale a heavy swirl of
smoke

hpwo days later we were in the

  -t higher altitudes he continued
we had not yet reached the part
of the country we sought but de-
cided to rest here a day or so before
moving on we could perhaps pick
an easier access to the plateau above

  the morning of the third day
seton and his wife set out together
it was noon when clara returned
alone disheveled and torn she
came running toward me with a wild
look in her eyes it was patent at a
glance that something had happened
-something horrible there was an
ashiness in her cheeks that even her
rich coat of tan could not conceal
it was the one time that i noticed
for all her amazing beauty she was
sinister there was cruelty about
her quivering mouth in the terror
of her speech-not conscious cruelty
but the more terrifying careless
cruelty of nature itself

   quick she gasped he is being
killed

  her very looks and speech de-
manded action and quickly procur-
ing my automatic i prepared to fol-
fow her at once without further
questioning clara still carried her

own lightweight - she led off
through the thick foliage of cane
which seemed to be the particular
vegetation at this altitude off to
where the side of the mountain
sloped to a steep pitch that dropped
far below to the valley floor across
a tangle of interlacing stems and off-
shoots that reached a height of three
or four feet and was in some places
strong enough to bear our weight

 as i struggled along behind
clara i seemed to sense a subtle
change in her attitude toward me-
a new intentness a doubt plainly
tinged with apprehension what was
it what had happened to seton
but it was no time now to ask ques-
tions i set down her expression of
fear and bewilderment as the result
of her husband being in danger

 it was rough going on hands
and knees we could crawl along for
a few yards over the tangled mass
of bamboo then strike a weak place
and mash through to the ground in
a smother of tangled leaves and
hampering tendrils-scramble out
and go on by the time we were five
hundred yards across that slope we
were soaked with perspiration and
nearly fagged out

 it was nearly sunset when we
reached a comparatively level stretch
beyond which the mountain dropped
away suddenly as though to make up
for lost time across this place the
cane was unusually thick and it was
here a few yards short of the steep
slope that clara her face blanched
to the hue of dirty parchment and
her forehead dewed with cold per-
spiration stgpped and pointed

  i reached her side and looked
down into a sort of pear-shaped cave
perhaps a dozen yards in diameter
and about half as high daylight
filtered through a ragged hole at our
feet pitifully weak but enough to
disclose the mingled rocks and eartk
that formed the walls of the en-
closure and the whitish diseased-
looking vines that twined up them
the cave of spiders



to the opening the exuding air was
hot steamy and loaded with the
smell of rotting vegetation

  on the floor among the rocks and
moldy roots lay seton yet it was
not this fact alone that caused me to
stiffen that almost caused my eyes
to bulge from their sockets was it
madness this gruesome fascination
that held my eyes to the bottom of
that horrible pit was it a night-
mare these huge apparitions with
loathsome heads and misshapen
bodies that crawled over the body of
my friend

 spiders enormous spiders
black with yellow stripes legs that
fairly bristled with spines ugh god
it was awful i could see them cling-
ing to the irregularities in the slimy
walls-the most gigantic spiders i
had ever set eyes upon i tried to
close my eyes-or to turn them away
from the poisonous well it was use-
less i must look

  into that black cavern i stared
-to feel my scalp tingle horrifically
to know the crowning terror of this
fateful journey the blackness was
spangled with watching glittering
eyes-with tiny eyes that moved
upon the walls upon the floor and
upon the now inert body of seton
over him they crawled a veritable
army of the venomous creatures
bloated unwieldy so great of body
that their hideous hairy legs could
scarce support them

  their mouths dripped blood and
flesh as they tore at their unfortunate
victim already part of the body
was eaten clean to the bones what
monstrosities of the insect kingdom
constituted that obscene host i do
not know i only know that my skin
tingled from forehead to feet and i
experienced a sensation as if a mil-
lion of these unclean things clung
to me i could hear them moving
crawling tearing with a sort of
rustling sound-a faint sibilance in-
describably loathsome

  a choking cry rose to my lips

but i was unable to utter any save
mumbling sounds with an effort i
withdrew my gaze from that hellish
scene as there came a low moan in
my ear clara seton wrought upon
past endurance with a sobbing cry
sank at my feet and lay still

  panic plucking at my heart i
gathered her up in my arms and
stumbled from that place of grue-
some horror  

 graves dropped the stub of his
cigarette into his empty cup and
passed his hand across his forehead
as if to clear it i remember little
of that journey back to the coast i
only know that we both were
strangely silent our nerves were
overwrought by setons untimely
end when we reached guayaquil a
full report was sent to the museum
explaining how he had accidentally
fallen into the cave and lying
stunned had become an easy prey
for the spiders before aid could be
summoned

  but i objected you didnt
examine the body you should have
been more thorough

  he looked at me strangely there
are times he said of which no
man can recall his mental impres-
sions moments so acutely horrible
that mercifully our memory retains
nothing of the emotions they oc-
casioned the time i stood looking
into that pit was one of them aft-
erward in my calmer moments i
realized it would have been folly
the man was unmistakably dead

  i studied him awhile perhaps i
am somewhat of a woman-hater
anyway i said scornfully enough
no woman is worth that
graves eyes bored into me he
jerked himself upright the light of
comprehension seemed at last to have
seeped through his brain he darted
his hand across the table and clutch-
ing my arm glared fixedly at me
you lie he gritted

  i saw he was sincere i had always
thought so but i had to tell him


weird tales

  he had risen to leave me anger
flaring from his eyes

  wait i said and a curious hes-
itation seemed to hold him the
museum people sent me down there
they werent satisfied with your ex-
planation i followed your trail to
your last camp it took me three
days to find the cave-and the body
the spiders were there but i man-
aged to remove the body and i
found what you would have found
had you recovered it seton was not
killed by his fall or by the spiders
he had been shot through the brain
with a bullet fired from a special
- rifle

for a long time graves gazed at
me i do not know whether any-
one around us noticed him i dont

think so his face-i could never

describe it but it was as grim as
death there was some mental strug-
gle going on within he seemed to
be conscious of many aching sensi-
bilities to have gone wrong and
to have been set right makes a double
trial for mans vanity the realiza-
tion of his own weakness and un-
faith had staggered him to the heart
and increased the bitterness of sur-
prize

  finally he stuck out his hand and
said   thanks old man   then he
was gone

  the next morning i received two
telegrams one to the effect that
graves was on his way to california
and the other that clara seton had
been taken into custody

 the creatures

                 vast wings were flapping in the still night air

i	saw great shadows cross a gibbous moon

                the mandrakes moaned along the black lagoon

and in the sky there hung a baleful glare

                terror and death seemed stalking everywhere

                 and still those vast wings beat that sullen tune
                 were they strange creatures from outside that soon
                 would seize their prey and seek their cosmic lairf

                 out of the night there came a shrill long scream

and through the riven air there harshly swept
the charnel sounds of awful slaughtering

                at first i deemed it some mad nightmare-dream

                but from the sundered room i never crept-

my face was eaten by a red huge thing

the deep chuckle ceased and in its place
came a frantic ululant yelp as of a thou-
sand ghouls in torment

few persons know the inside of
the clarendon story or even
that there is an inside not
reached by the newspapers it was a
san francisco sensation in the days
before the fire both because of the
panic and menace that kept it com-
pany and because of its close link-
age with the governor of the state
governor dalton it will be recalled
was clarendons best friend and
later married his sister neither
dalton nor mrs dalton would ever

 editors note-dr de castro was author
with ambrose bierce of the monk and the
hangmans daughter at that time he used his
full name gustaf adolf de castro danziger
which he has since shortened to his ancestral
spanish form adolphe de castro we com-
mend the last test to those who appreciate a truly
artistic story with its suggestions of unthink-
able horrors from the elder world which sweep
through the story like a cold breeze from the
tomb

   w t-

discuss the painful affair but some-
how the facts have leaked out to a
limited circle but for that and for
the years wrhich have given a sort of
vagueness and impersonality to the
actors one would still pause before
probing into secrets so strictly guard-
ed at the time

 the appointment of dr alfred
clarendon as medical director of san
quentin penitentiary in - was
greeted with the keenest enthusiasm
throughout california san fran-
cisco had at last the honor of har-
boring one of the greatest biologists
and physicians of the period and
solid pathological leaders from all
over the world might be expected to
flock thither to study his methods
profit by his advice and researches

                                   


weird tales

and learn how to cope with their own
local problems california almost
over night would become a center of
medical scholarship with earthwide
influence and reputation

 governor dalton anxious to
spread the news in its fullest sig-
nificance saw to it that the press
carried ample and dignified accounts
of his new appointee pictures of
dr clarendon and his new home
near old goat hill sketches of his
career and manifold honors and
popular accounts of his salient scien-
tific discoveries were all presented in
the principal california dailies till
the public soon felt a sort of reflected
pride in the man whose studies of
pyemia in india of the pest in china
and of every sort of kindred disorder
elsewhere would soon enrich the
world of medicine with an antitoxin
of revolutionary importance-a basic
antitoxin combating the whole feb-
rile principle at its very source and
ensuring the ultimate conquest and
extirpation of fever in all its diverse
forms

  back of the appointment stretched
an extended and not wholly unro-
mantic history of early friendship
long separation and dramatically re-
newed acquaintance james dalton
and the clarendon family had been
friends in new york ten years be-
fore-friends and more than friends
since the doctors only sister
georgina was the sweetheart of dal-
tons youth while the doctor himself
had been his closest associate and al-
most his protege in the days of school
and college the father of alfred and
georgina a wall street pirate of the
ruthless elder breed had known dal-
tons father well so well indeed
that he had finally stripped him of
all he possessed in a memorable
afternoons fight on the stock ex-
change dalton senior hopeless of
recuperation and wishing to give his
one adored child the benefit of his
insurance had promptly blown out
his brains but james had not sought

to retaliate it was as he viewed it
all in the game and he wished no
harm to the father of the girl he
meant to marry and of the budding
young scientist whose admirer and
protector he had been throughout
their years of fellowship and study
instead he turned to the law estab-
lished himself in a small wray and in
due course of time asked old clar-
endon for georginas hand

  old clarendon had refused very
firmly and loudly vowing that no
pauper and upstart lawyer was fit to
be his son-in-law and a scene of con-
siderable violence had occurred
james telling the wrinkled free-
booter at last what he ought to have
been told long before had left the
house and the city in a high temper
and was embarked within a month
upon the california life which was to
lead him to the governorship through
many a fight with ring and politician
his farewells to alfred and geor-
gina had been brief and he had
never known the aftermath of that
scene in the clarendon library only
by a day did he miss the news of old
clarendons death from apoplexy
and by so missing it changed the
course of his whole career he had
not written georgina in the decade
that followed knowing her loyalty
to her father and waiting till his
own fortune and position might re-
move all obstacles to the match nor
had he sent any word to alfred
whose calm indifference in the face
of affection and hero-worship had al-
ways savored of conscious destiny
and the self-sufficiency of genius
secure in the ties of a constancy rare
even then he had worked and risen
with thoughts only of the future
still a bachelor and with a perfect
intuitive faith that georgina also
was waiting

  in this faith dalton was not de-
ceived wondering perhaps why no
message ever came georgina found
no romance save in her dreams and
expectations and in the course of
the last test

i

time became busy with the new
responsibilities brought by her broth-
ers rise to greatness alfreds
growth had not belied the promise of
his youth and the slim boy had
darted quietly up the steps of science
with a speed and permanence almost
dizzying to contemplate lean and
ascetic with steel-rimmed pince-nez
and pointed brown beard dr alfred
clarendon was an authority at
twenty-five and an international
figure at thirty careless of worldly
affairs with the negligence of genius
he depended vastly on the care and
management of his sister and was
secretly thankful that her memories
of james had kept her from other
and more tangible alliances

georgina conducted the business
and household of the great bac-
teriologist and was proud of his
strides toward the conquest of fever
she bore patiently with his eccen-
tricities calmed his occasional bursts
of fanaticism and healed those
breaches with his friends which now
and then resulted from his uncon-
cealed scorn of anything less than
a single-minded devotion to pure
truth and its progress clarendon
was undeniably irritating at times to
ordinary folk for he never tired of
depreciating the service of the indi-
vidual as contrasted with the service
of mankind as a whole and in cen-
suring men of learning who mingled
domestic life or outside interests
with their pursuit of abstract sci-
ence his enemies called him a bore
but his admirers pausing before the
white heat of ecstasy into which he
would work himself became almost
ashamed of ever having had any
standards or aspirations outside the
one divine sphere of unalloyed
knowledge

  the doctors travels were exten-
sive and georgina generally accom-
panied him on the shorter ones
three times however he had taken
long lone jaunts to strange and dis-

tant places in his studies of exotic
fevers and half-fabulous plagues
for he knew that it is out of the un-
known lands of cryptic and im-
memorial asia that most of the
earths diseases spring on each of
these occasions he had brought back
curious mementoes which added to
the eccentricity of his home not least
among which was the needlessly
large staff of eight tibetan servants
picked up somewhere in u-tsang dur-
ing an epidemic of which the world
never heard but amidst which clar-
endon had discovered and isolated
the germ of black fever these men
taller than most tibetans and clearly
belonging to a stock but little inves-
tigated in the outside world were of
a skeletonic leanness which made one
wonder whether the doctor had
sought to symbolize in them the an-
atomical models of his college years
their aspect in the loose black silk
robes of boupa priests which he
chose to give them was giotesque in
the highest degree and there was an
unsmiling silence and stiffness in
their motions which enhanced their
air of fantasy and gave georgina a
queer awed feeling of having stum-
bled into the pages of vathek or the
arabian nights

  but queerest of all was the gen-
eral factotum or clinic-man whom
clarendon addressed as surama and
whom he had brought back with him
after a long stay in northern africa
during which he had studied certain
odd intermittent fevers among the
mysterious saharan tuaregs whose
descent from the primal race of lost
atlantis is an old archeological rumor
surama a man of great intelligence
and seemingly inexhaustible erudi-
tion was as morbidly lean as the tib-
etan servants with swarthy parch-
mentlike skin drawn so tightly over
his bald pate and hairless face that
every line of the skull stood out in
ghastly prominence-this deaths-
head effect being heightened by luster-
lessly burning black eyes set with a


weird tales

depth which left to common visibil-
ity only a pair of dark vacant sock-
ets unlike the ideal subordinate he
seemed despite his impassive features
to spend an effort in concealing such
emotions as he possessed instead
he carried about an insidious at-
mosphere of irony or amusement
accompanied at certain moments by
a deep guttural chuckle like that of
a giant turtle which has just torn to
pieces some furry animal and is am-
bling away toward the sea his race
appeared to be caucasian but could
not be classified more closely than
that some of clarendons friends
thought he looked like a high-caste
hindoo notwithstanding his accent-
less speech while many agreed with
georgina-who disliked him-when
she gave her opinion that a pha-
raohs mummy if miraculously
brought to life would form a very
apt twin for this sardonic skeleton

  dalton absorbed in his up-hill
political battles and isolated from
eastern interests through the pecul-
iar self-sufficiency of the old west
had not followed the meteoric rise of
his former comrade clarendon had
actually heard nothing of one so far
outside his chosen world of science
as the governor being of indepen-
dent and even of abundant means
the clarendons had for many years
stuck to their old manhattan man-
sion in east nineteenth stieet
whose ghosts must have looked sore-
ly askance at the bizarrerie of su-
rama and the tibetans then through
the doctors wish to transfer his base
of medical observation the great
change had suddenly come and they
had crossed the continent to take up
a secluded life in san francisco
buying the gloomy old bannister
place near goat hill overlooking the
bay and establishing their strange
household in a rambling french-
roofed relic of mid-victorian design
and gold-rush parvenu display set
amidst high-walled grounds in a
region still half suburban

  dr clarendon though better satis-
fied than in new york still felt
cramped for lack of opportunities to
apply and test his pathological theo-
ries unworldly as he was he had
never thought of using his reputa-
tion as an influence to gain public
appointment though more and more
he realized that only the medical di-
rectorship of a government or a
charitable institution-a prison
almshouse or hospital-would give
him a field of sufficient width to com-
plete his researches and make his dis-
coveries of the greatest use to hu-
manity and science at large

  then he had run into james dal-
ton by sheer accident one afternoon
in market street as the governor was
swinging out of the royal hotel
georgina had been with him and an
almost instant recognition had
heightened the drama of the reunion
mutual ignorance of one anothers
progress had bred long explanations
and histories and clarendon was
pleased to find that he had so im-
portant an official for a friend dal-
ton and georgina exchanging many
a glance felt more than a trace of
their youthful tenderness and a
friendship was then and there re-
vived which led to frequent calls and
a fuller and fuller exchange of confi-
dences

  james dalton learned of his old
proteges need for political appoint-
ment and sought true to his protec-
tive role of school and college days
to devise some means of giving
little alf the needed position and
scope he had it is true wide ap-
pointive powers but the legisla-
tures constant attacks and encroach-
ments forced him to exercise these
with the utmost discretion at
length howevei scarcely three
months after the sudden reunion the
foremost institutional medical office
in the state fell vacant weighing
all the elements with care and con-
scious that his friends achievements
and reputation would justify the
the last test



most substantial rewards the gover-
nor felt at lat able to act formali-
ties were few and on the th of no-
vember - dr alfred schuyler
clarendon became medical director
of the california state penitentiary
at san quentin



in scarcely more than a month the
hopes of dr clarendons admirers
were amply fulfilled sweeping
changes in methods brought to the
prisons medical routine an efficiency
never before dreamed of and though
the subordinates were naturally not
without jealousy they were obliged
to admit the magical results of a
really great mans superintendence
then came a time when mere appre-
ciation might well have grown to
devout thankfulness at a providen-
tial conjunction of time place and
man for one morning dr jones
came to his new chief with a grave
face to announce his discovery of a
case which he could not but identify
as that selfsame black fever whose
germ clarendon had found and
classified

  dr clarendon showed no surprize
but kept on at the writing before
him

  i know he said evenly i
came across that case yesterday im
glad you recognized it put the man
in a separate ward though i dont
believe this fever is contagious  

  dr jones with his own opinion of
the maladys contagiousness was
glad of this deference to caution
and hastened to execute the order
upon his return clarendon rose to
leave declaring that he would him-
self take charge of the case alone
disappointed in his wish to study the
great mans methods and technique
the junior physician watched his
chief stride away toward the lone
ward where he had placed the pa-
tient more critical of the new regime

than at any time since admiration
had displaced his first jealous pangs

  reaching the ward clarendon en-
tered hastily glancing at the bed
and stepping back to see how far dr
joness obvious curiosity might have
led him then finding the corridor
still vacant he shut the door and
turned to examine the sufferer the
man was a convict of a peculiarly re-
pulsive type and seemed to be
racked by the keenest throes of
agony his features were frightful-
ly contracted and his knees drawn
sharply up in the mute desperation
of the stricken clarendon studied
him closely raising his tightly shut
eyelids took his pulse and tempera-
ture and finally dissolving a tablet
in water forced the solution between
the sufferers lips before long the
height of the attack abated as
shown by the relaxing body and re-
turning normality of expression and
the patient began to breathe more
easily then by a soft rubbing of
the ears the doctor caused the man
to open his eyes there was life in
them for they moved from side to
side though they lacked the fine fire
which we are wont to deem the
image of the soul clarendon smiled
as he surveyed the peace his help had
brought feeling behind him the pow-
er of an all-capable science he had
long known of this case and had
snatched the victim from death with
the work of a moment another
hour and this man would have gone
-yet jones had seen the symptoms
for days before discovering them
and having discovered them did not
know what to do

  mans conquest of disease how-
ever can not be perfect clarendon
assuring the dubious trusty-nurses
that the fever was not contagious
had had the patient bathed sponged
in alcohol and put to bed but was
told the next morning that the case
was lost the man had died after
midnight in the most intense agony
and with such cries and distortions


weird tales

 of faee that the nurses were driven
 almost to panic the doctor took
 this news with his usual calm what-
 i ever his scientific feelings may have
 been and ordered the burial of the
 patient in quicklime then with a
 philosophic shrug of the shoulders
 he made the usual rounds of the
 penitentiary

   two days later the prison was hit
 again three men came down at
 once this time and there was no con-
 cealing the fact that a black fever
  epidemic was under way claren-
 don having adhered so firmly to his
 theory of non-contagiousness suffered
 a distinct loss of prestige and was
 handicapped by the refusal of the
 trusty-nurses to attend the patients
 theirs was not the soul-free devotion
 of those who sacrifice themselves to
 science and humanity they were
 convicts serving only because of the
 privileges they could not otherwise
 buy and when the price became too
 great they preferred to resign the
 privileges

    but the doctor was still master of
 the situation consulting with the
 warden and sending urgent messages
 to his friend the governor he saw to
 it that special rewards in cash and in
 reduced terms were offered to the
 convicts for the dangerous nursing
 service and by this method succeed-
 ed in getting a very fair quota of
 volunteers he was steeled for ac-
 tion now and nothing could shak
 his poise and determination addi-
 tional cases brought only a curt nod
 and he seemed a stranger to fatigue
 as he hastened from bedside to bed-
 side all over the vast stone home of
 sadness and evil more than forty
 cases developed within another week
 and nurses had to be brought from the
 city clarendon went home very sel-
 dom at this stage often sleeping on a
 cot in the wardens quarters and al-
 ways giving himself up with typi-
 cal abandon to the service of medicine
 and of mankind

then came the first mutterings of
that storm which was soon to con-
vulse san francisco news will out
and the menace of black fever spread
over the town like a fog from the bay
reporters trained in the doctrine of
sensation first used their imagina-
tion without restraint and gloried
when at last they were able to produce
a ease in the mexican quarter which a
local physician-fonder perhaps of
money than of truth or civic welfare
-pronounced black fever

  that was the last straw frantic
at the thought of the crawling death
so ciose upon them the people of san
francisco went mad en masse and em-
barked upon that historic exodus of
which all the eoiuitrv was soon to
hear over busy wires ferries and
rowboats excursion steamers and
launches railways and cable cars bi-
cycles and carriages moving-vans and
work carts all were pressed into in-
stant and frenzied service sausa-
lito and tamalpais as lying in the
direction of san quentin shared in
the flight while housing space in
oakland berkeley and alameda rose
to fabulous prices tent colonies
sprang up and improvised villages
lined the crowded southward high-
ways from millbrae to san jose
many sought refuge with friends in
sacramento while the fright-shaken
residue forced by various causes to
stay behind could do little more than
maintain the basic necessities of a
nearly dead city

  business save for quack doctors
with sure cures and preventives
for use against the fever fell rapidly
to the vanishing-point at first the
saloons offered medicated drinks
but soon found that the populace pre-
ferred to be duped by eharlatans of
more professional aspect in strange-
ly noiseless streets persons peered into
one anothers faces to glimpse possible
plague symptoms and shopkeepers
began more and more to refuse admis-
sion to their clientele each customer
the last test



seeming to them a fresh fever menace
legal and judicial machinery began
to disintegrate as attorneys and
county clerks succumbed one by one
to the urge for flight even the doc-
tors deserted in large numbers many
of them pleading the need of vaca-
tions among the mountains and the
lakes in the northern part of the
state schools and colleges theaters
and cafes restaurants and saloons
all gradually closed their doors and
in a single week san franeisco lay
prostrate and inert with only its
light power and water service even
half normal with newspapers in
skeletonie form and with a crippled
parody on transportation maintained
by the horse and cable cars

  this was the lowest ebb it could
not last long for courage and obser-
vation are not altogether dead in man-
kind and sooner or later the non-
existence of any widespread black
fever epidemic outside san quentin
became too obvious a fact to deny
notwithstanding several actual cases
and the undeniable spread of typhoid
in the insanitary suburban tent col-
onies the leaders and editors of the
community conferred and took action
enlisting in their service the very re-
porters whose energies had done so
much to bring on the trouble but now
turning their sensation first avid-
ity into more constructive channels
editorials and fictitious interviews
appeared telling of dr clarendons
complete control of the disease and of
the absolute impossibility of its dif-
fusion beyond the prison walls re-
iteration and circulation slowly did
their work and gradually a slim back-
ward trickle of urbanites swelled into
a vigorous refluent stream one of the
first healthy symptoms was the start
of a newspaper controversy of the
approved acrimonious kind attempt-
ing to fix blame for the panic wher-
ever the various participants thought
it belonged the returning doctors
jealously strengthened by their timely
vacations began striking at claren-

don assuring the public that they as
well as he would keep the fever in
leash and censuring him for not doing
even more to check its spread within
san quentin

  clarendon had they averred per-
mitted far more deaths than were
necessary the veriest tyro in medi-
cine knew how to check fever con-
tagion  and if this renowned savant
did not do it it was clearly because he
chose for scientific reasons to study
the final effects of the disease rather
than to prescribe properly and save
the victims this policy they insinu-
ated might be proper enough among
convicted murderers in a penal insti-
tution but it would not do in san
francisco where life was still a pre-
cious and sacred thing thus they
went on and the papers were glad to
publish all they wrote since the
sharpness of the campaign in which
dr clarendon would doubtless join
would help to obliterate confusion and
restore confidence among the people

  but clarendon did not reply he
only smiled while his singular clinie-
nian suranxa indulged in many a
deep testudinous chuckle he was at
home more nowadays so that report-
ers began besieging the gate of the
great wall the doctor had built around
his house instead of pestering the
wardens office at san quentin re-
sults though were equally meager
for surama formed an impassable bar-
rier between the doctor and the outer
world-even after the reporters had
got into the grounds the newspaper
men getting access to the front hall
had glimpses of clarendons singular
entourage and made the best they
could in a write-up of surama and
the queer skeletonie tibetans exag-
geration of course occurred in every
fresh article and the net effect of the
publicity was distinctly adverse to the
great physician most persons hate
the unusual and hundreds who could
have excused heartlessness or incom-
petence stood ready to condemn the
grotesque taste manifested in the


weird tales

chuckling attendant and the eight
black-robed orientals

early in january an especially per-
sistent young man from the
observer climbed the moated eight-
foot brick wall in the rear of the clar-
endon grounds and began a survey of
the varied outdoor appearances which
trees concealed from the front walk
with quick alert brain he took in
everything-the rose-arbor the avia-
ries the animal cages where all sorts
of mammalia from monkeys to guinea-
pigs might be seen and heard the
stout wooden clinic building with
barred windows in the northwest cor-
ner of the yard-and bent searching
glances throughout the thousand
square feet of intramural privacy
a great article was brewing and he
would have escaped unscathed but for
the barking of dick georgina clar-
endons gigantic and beloved st
bernard surama instant in his
response had the youth by the collar
before a protest could be uttered and
was presently shaking him as a terrier
shakes a rat and dragging him
through the trees to the front yard
and the gate

  breathless explanations and qua-
vering demands to see dr clarendon
were useless surama only chuckled
and dragged his victim on suddenly
a positive fright crept over the dapper
scribe and he began to wish desper-
ately that this unearthly creature
would speak if only to prove that he
really was a being of honest flesh and
blood belonging to this planet he
became deathly sick and strove not to
glimpse the eyes which he knew must
lie at the base of those gaping black
sockets soon he heard the gate open
and felt himself propelled violently
through in another moment waking
rudely to the things of earth as he
landed wetly and muddily in the
ditch which clarendon had had dug
around the entire length of the wall
fright gave place to rage as he heard
the massive gate slam shut and he

rose dripping to shake his fist at the
forbidding portal then as he turned
to go a soft sound grated behind him
and through a small wicket in the gate
he felt the sunken eyes of surama and
heard the echoes of a deep-voiced
blood-freezing chuckle

  this young man feeling perhaps
justly that his handling had been
rougher than he deserved resolved to
revenge himself upon the household
responsible for his treatment accord-
ingly he prepared a fictitious inter-
view with dr clarendon supposed to
be held in the clinic building during
which he was careful to describe the
agonies of a dozen black fever pa-
tients whom his imagination ranged
on orderly rows of couches his
master-stroke was the picture of one
especially pathetic sufferer gasping
for water while the doctor held a
glass of the sparkling fluid just out of
his reach in a scientific attempt to
determine the effect of a tantalizing
emotion on the course of the disease
this invention was followed by para-
graphs of insinuating comment so out-
wardly respectful that it bore a
double venom dr clarendon was
the article ran undoubtedly the
greatest and most single-minded
scientist in the world but science is
no friend to individual welfare and
one would not like to have ones
gravest ills drawn out and aggravated
merely to satisfy an investigator on
some point of abstract truth life is
too short for that

  altogether the article was dia-
bolically skilful and succeeded in hor-
rifying nine readers out of ten against
dr clarendon and his supposed meth-
ods other papers were quick to copy
and enlarge upon its substance taking
the cue it offered and commencing a
series of faked interviews which
fairly ran the gamut of derogatory
fantasy in no case however did the
doctor condescend to offer a contra-
diction he had no time to waste on
fools and liars and cared little for
the esteem of a thoughtless rabble he
the last test



despised when james dalton tel-
egraphed his regrets and offered aid
clarendon replied with an almost
boorish curtness he did not heed the
barking of dogs and could not bother
to muzzle them nor would he thank
anyone for messing with a matter
wholly beneath notice silent and
contemptuous he continued his duties
with tranquil evenness

  but the young reporters spark had
done its work san francisco was in-
sane again and this time as much
with rage as with fear sober judg-
ment became a lost art and though no
second exodus occurred there ensued
a reign of vice andrecklessness born
of desperation and suggesting paral-
lel phenomena in mediaeval times of
pestilence hatred ran riot against
the man who had found the disease
and was struggling to restrain it and
a light-headed public forgot his great
services to knowledge in their efforts
to fan the flames of resentment they
seemed in their blindness to hate him
in person rather than the plague
which had come to their breeze-
cleaned and usually healthy city

  then the young reporter playing
in the neronic fire he had kindled
added a crowning personal touch of
his own remembering the indignities
he had suffered at the hands of the
cadaverous clinic-man he prepared a
masterly article on the home and en-
vironment of dr clarendon giving
especial prominence to surama whose
very aspect he declared sufficient to
scare the healthiest person into any
sort of fever he tried to make the
gaunt chuckler appear equally ridicu-
lous and terrible succeeding best
perhaps in the latter half of his in-
tention since a tide of horror always
welled up whenever he thought of his
brief proximity to the creature he
collected all the rumors current about
the man elaborated on the unholy
depth of his reputed scholarship and
hinted darkly that it could have been
no godly realm of secret and eon-

weighted africa wherein dr claren-
don had found him

  georgina who followed the papers
closely felt crushed and hurt by these
attacks upon her brother but james
dalton who called often at the house
did his best to comfort her in this
he was warm and sincere for he
wished not only to console the woman
he loved but to utter some measure of
the reverence he had always felt for
the starward-bound genius who had
been his youths closest comrade he
told georgina how greatness can
never be exempted from the shafts of
envy and cited the long sad list of
splendid brains crushed beneath vul-
gar heels the attacks he pointed
out formed the truest of all proofs of
alfreds solid eminence

  but they hurt just the same she
rejoined   and all the more because i
know that a really suffers from them
no matter how indifferent he tries to
be

  dalton kissed her hand in a man-
ner not then obsolete among well-boni
persons

  and it hurts me a thousand times
more knowing that it hurts you and
alf but never mind georgie well
stand together and pull through it

thus it came about that georgina
came more and more to rely on the
strength of the steel-firm square-
jawed governor who had been her
youthful swain and more and more
to confide in him the things she
feared the press attacks and the
epidemic were not quite all there
were aspects of the household which
she did not like surama cruel in
equal measure to man and beast
filled her with the most unnamable
repulsion and she could not but feel
that he meant some vague indefinable
harm to alfred she did not like the
tibetans either and thought it very
peculiar that surama was able to talk
with them alfred would not tell her
who or what surama was but had


weird tales

once explained rather haltingly that
he was a much older man than would
be commonly thought credible and
that he had mastered secrets and been
through experiences calculated to
make him a colleague of phenomenal
value for any scientist seeking na-
tures hidden mysteries

  urged by her uneasiness dalton be-
came a still more frequent visitor at
the clarendon home though he saw
that his presence was deeply resented
by surama the bony clinic-man
formed the habit of glaring peculiarly
from those spectral sockets when ad-
mitting him and would often after
closing the gate when he left chuckle
monotonously in a manner that made
his flesh creep meanwhile dr clar-
endon seemed oblivious of everything
save his work at san quentin whither
he went each day in his launch-alone
save for surama who managed the
wheel while the doctor read or col-
lated his notes dalton welcomed
these regular absences for they gave
him constant opportunities to renew
his suit for georginas hand when
he would overstay and meet alfred
however the latters greeting was al-
ways- friendly despite his habitual
reserve in time the engagement of
james and georgina grew to be a
definite thing and the two awaited
only a favorable chance to speak to
alfred

 the governor whole-souled in
everything and firm in his protective
loyalty spared no pains in spreading
propaganda on his old friends be-
half press and officialdom both felt
his influence and he even succeded in
interesting scientists in the east
many of whom came to california to
study the plague and investigate the
anti-fever bacillus which clarendon
was so rapidly isolating and perfect-
ing these doctors and biologists
however did not obtain the informa-
tion they wished so that several of
them left with a very unfortunate im-
pression not a few prepared articles
hostile to clarendon accusing him of

an unscientific and fame-seeking atti-
tude and intimating that he concealed
his methods through a highly unpro-
fessional desire for ultimate personal
profit

  others fortunately were more lib-
eral in their judgments and wrote en-
thusiastically of clarendon and his
work they had seen the patients
and could appreciate how marvelously
he held the dread disease in leash his
secrecy regarding the antitoxin they
deemed quite justifiable since its pub-
lic diffusion in unperfected form
could not but do more harm than
good clarendon himself whom many
of their number had met before im-
pressed them more profoundly than
ever and they did not hesitate to com-
pare him with jenner lister koch
pasteur metchnikoff and the rest of
those whose whole lives have served
pathology and humanity dalton was
careful to save for alfred all the
magazines that spoke well of him
often bringing them in person as an
excuse to see georgina they did not
however produce much effect save a
contemptuous smile and clarendon
would generally throw them to su-
rama whose deep disturbing chuckle
upon reading formed a close parallel
to the doctors own ironic amusement

one monday evening early in feb-
 ruary dalton called with the
definite intention of asking clarendon
for his sisters hand georgina her-
self admitted him to the grounds and
as they walked toward the house he
stopped to pat the great dog which
rushed up and laid friendly forepaws
on his breast it was dick georginas
cherished st bernard and dalton
was glad to feel that he had the
affection of a creature which meant
so much to her

  dick was excited and glad and
turned the governor nearly half about
with his vigorous pressure as he gave
a soft quick bark and sprang off
through the trees toward the clinic
he did not vanish though but pres-
the last test



ently stopped and looked back softly
barking again as if he wished dalton
to follow georgina fond of obeying
her huge pets playful whims mo-
tioned to james to see what he want-
ed  and they both walked slowly after
him as he trotted relievedly to the
rear of the yard where the top of
the clinic building stood silhouetted
against the stars above the great
brick wall

  the outline of lights within showed
around the edges of the dark window-
curtains so they knew that alfred
and surama were at work suddenly
from the interior came a thin sub-
dued sound like a cry of a child-a
plaintive call of mamma mam-
ma at which dick barked while
james and georgina started percep-
tibly then georgina smiled re-
membering the parrots that claren-
don always kept for experimental
uses and patted dick on the head
either to forgive him for having
fooled her and dalton or to console
him for having been fooled himself

  as they turned slowly toward the
house dalton mentioned his resolve to
speak to alfred that evening about
their engagement and georgina sup-
plied no objection she knew that
her brother would not relish the loss
of a faithful manager and companion
but believed his affection would place
no barrier in the way of her happi-
ness

  later that evening clarendon came
into the house with a springy step and
aspect less grim than usual dalton
seeing a good omen in this easy buoy-
ancy took heart as the doctor wrung
his hand with a jovial ah jimmy
hows politics this year he glanced
at georgina and she quietly excused
herself while the two men settled
down to a chat on general subjects
little by little amidst many remind-
ers of their old youthful days dal-
ton worked toward his point till at
last he came out plainly with the cru-
cial query

  alf i want to marry georgina
have we your blessing

  keenly watching his old friend
dalton saw a shadow steal over his
face the dark eyes flashed for a mo-
ment then veiled themselves as wont-
ed placidity returned so science or
selfishness was at work after all

  youre asking an impossibility
james georgina isnt the aimless
butterfly she was years ago she has
a place in the service of truth and
mankind now and that place is here
shes decided to devote her life to my
work-to the household that makes
my work possible-and theres no
room for desertion or personal ca-
price  

  dalton waited to see if he had fin-
ished the same old fanaticism-hu-
manity versus the individual-and the
doctor was going to let it spoil his
sisters life then he tried to answer

  but look here alf do you mean
to say that georgina in particular is
so necessary to your work that you
must make a slave and martyr of her 
use your sense of proportion man
if it were a question of surama or
somebody in the utter thick of your
experiments it might be different but
after all georgina is only a house-
keeper to you in the last analysis she
has promised to be my wife and says
that she loves me have you the right
to cut her off from the life that
belongs to her have you the
right-

  thatll do james clarendons
face was set and white whether or
not i have the right to govern my own
family is no business of an outsider

  outsider-you can say that to a

man who- dalton almost choked

as the steely voice of the doctor inter-
rupted him again

  an outsider to my family and
from now on an outsider to my home
dalton your presumption goes just a
little too far good evening gover-
nor


weird tales

  and clarendon strode from the
room without extending his hand

  dalton hesitated for a moment al-
most at a loss what to do when pres-
ently georgina entered her face
showed that she had spoken with her
brother and dalton took both her
hands impetuously

  well georgie what do you say
im afraid its a choice between alf
and me you know how i feel-you
know how i felt before when it was
your father i was up against what s
your answer this time   

  he paused as she responded slowly

  james dear do you believe that
i love you

  he nodded and pressed her hands
expectantly

  then if you love me youll wait
a while dont think of als rude-
ness hes to be pitied i cant tell
you the whole thing now but you
know how worried i am-what with
the strain of his work the criticisms
and the staring and cackling of that
horrible creature surama im afraid
he  break down-he shows the strain
more than anyone outside the family
could tell i can see it for ive
watched him all my life hes
changing-slowly bending under his
burdens-and he puts on his extra
bruskness to hide it you can see
what i mean cant you dear

  she paused and dalton nodded
again pressing one of her hands to
his breast then she concluded

    so promise me dear to be patient
i must stand by him i must i
must

  dalton did not speak for a while
but his head inclined in what was al-
most a bow of reverence there was
more of christ in this devoted woman
than he had thought any human be-
ing possessed and in the face of such
love and loyalty he could do no urg-
ing

  words of sadness and parting were
brief and james whose blue eyes
were misty scarcely saw the gaunt
clinic-man as the gate to the street

was at last opened to him but when it
slammed to behind him he heard that
blood-curdling chuckle he had come to
recognize so well and knew that su-
rama was there - surama whom
georgina had called her brothers evil
genius walking away with a firm
step dalton resolved to be watchful
and to act at the first sign of trouble



meanwhile san francisco the
epidemic still on the lips of all
seethed with anti-clarendon feeling
actually the eases outside the peni-
tentiary were very few and confined
almost wholly to the lower mexican
element whose lack of sanitation was
a standing invitation to disease of
every kind but politicians and the
people needed no more than this to
confirm the attacks made by the doc-
tors enemies seeing that dalton
was immovable in his championship of
clarendon the malcontents medical
dogmatists and ward-heelers turned
their attention to the state legislature
lining up the anti-clarendonists and
the governors old enemies with great
shrewdness and preparing to launch
a law-with a veto-proof majority-
transferring the authority for minor
institutional appointments from the
chief executive to the various boards
or commissions concerned

  in the furtherance of this measure
no lobbyist was more active than
clarendons chief assistant dr
jones jealous of his superior from
the first he now saw an opportunity
for turning matters to his liking
and he thanked fate for the circum-
stance-responsible indeed for his
present position-of his relationship
to the chairman of the prison board
the new law if passed would cer-
tainly mean the removal of clarendon
and the appointment of himself in his
stead so mindful of his own interest
he worked hard for it jones was all
that clarendon was not-a natural
politician and sycophantic oppor-
the last test



tunist who served his own advance-
ment first and science only incidental-
ly he was poor and avid for
salaried position quite in contrast to
the wealthy and independent savant
he sought to displace so with a rat-
like cunning and persistence he
labored to undermine the great biol-
ogist above him and was one day
rewarded by the news that the new
law was passed thenceforward the
governor was powerless to make ap-
pointments to the state institutions
and the medical directorship of san
quentin lay at the disposal of the
prison board

  of all this legislative turmoil
clarendon was singularly oblivious
wrapped wholly in matters of ad-
ministration and research he was
blind to the treason of that ass
jones who worked by his side and
deaf to all the gossip of the wardens
office he had never in his life read
the newspapers and the banishment
of dalton from his house cut off his
last real link with the world of out-
side events with the naivete of a
recluse he at no time thought of his
position as insecure in view of dal-
tons loyalty and of his forgiveness
of even the greatest wrongs as shown
in his dealings with the elder clar-
endon who had crushed his father to
death on the stock exchange the
possibility of a gubernatorial dis-
missal was of course out of the ques-
tion nor could the doctors political
ignorance envisage a sudden shift of
power which might place the matter
of retention or dismissal in very
different hands thereupon he mere-
ly smiled with satisfaction when dal-
ton left for sacramento convinced
that his place in san quentin and
his sisters place in his household
were alike secure from disturbance
he was accustomed to having what
he wanted and fancied his luck was
still holding out

  the first week in march a day or
so after the enactment of the new law
the chairman of the prison board

called at san quentin clarendon
was out but dr jones was glad to
show the august visitor-his own
uncle incidentally-through the great
infirmary including the fever ward
made so famous by press and panic
by this time converted against his
will to clarendons belief in the
fevers non-contagiousness jones
smilingly assured his uncle that noth-
ing was to be feared and encour-
aged him to inspect the patients in
detail-especially a ghastly skeleton
once a very giant of bulk and vigor
who was he insinuated slowly and
painfully dying because clarendon
would not administer the proper
medieine

  do you mean to say cried the
chairman that dr clarendon re-
fuses to let the man have what he
needs knowing his life could be
saved

  just that snapped dr jones
pausing as the door opened to admit
none other than clarendon himself
clarendon nodded coldly to jones
and surveyed the visitor whom he
did not know with disapproval

  dr jones i thought you knew
this case was not to be disturbed at
all and havent i said that visitors
arent to be admitted except by spe-
cial permission

  but the chairman interrupted be-
fore his nephew could introduce him

  pardon me dr clarendon but
am i to understand that you refuse
to give this man the medicine that
would save him

  clarendon glared coldly and re-
joined with steel in his voice

  thats an impertinent question
sir i am in authority here and vis-
itors are not allowed please leave
the room at once  

  the chairman his sense of drama
secretly tickled answered with great-
er pomp and hauteur than were
necessary

  you mistake me sir i not you
am master here you are addressing
the chairman of the prison board i


weird tales

must say moreover that i deem your
activity a menace to the welfare of
the prisoners and must request your
resignation henceforth dr jones
will be in charge and if you wish to
remain until your formal dismissal
you will take your orders from him 
it was wilfred joness great mo-
ment life never gave him another
such climax and we need not grudge
him this one after all he was a
small rather than a bad man and he
had only obeyed a small mans code
of looking to himself at all costs
clarendon stood still gazing at the
speaker as if he thought him mad
till in another second the look of
triumph on dr joness face con-
vinced him that something important
was indeed afoot he was icily
courteous as he replied

    no doubt you are what you claim
to be sir but fortunately my ap-
pointment came from the governor
of the state and can therefore be re-
voked only by him

  the chairman and his nephew both
stared perplexedly for they had not
realized to what lengths unworldly
ignorance can go then the older
man grasping the situation ex-
plained at some length

  had i found that the current re-
ports did you an injustice he con-
cluded i would have deferred ac-
tion but the case of this poor man
and your own arrogant manner left

me no choice as it is-

  but dr clarendon interrupted
with a new razor-sharpness in his
voice

  as it is i am the director in
charge at present and i ask you to
leave this room at once

  the chairman reddened and ex-
ploded

  look here sir who do you think
youre talking to ill have you
chucked out of here-damn your
impertinence  

  but he had time only to finish the
sentence transformed by the insult
to a sudden dynamo of hate the

slender scientist launched out with
both fists in a burst of preternatural
strength of which no one would have
thought him capable and if his
strength was preternatural his ac-
curacy of aim was no less so for not
even a champion of the ring could
have wrought a neater result both
men-the chairman and dr jones-
were squarely hit the one full in the
face and the other on the point of
the chin going down like felled
trees they lay motionless and un-
conscious on the floor while claren-
don now clear and completely master
of himself took his hat and cane and
went out to join surama in the
launch only when seated in the
moving boat did he at last give au-
dible vent to the frightful rage that
consumed him then with face con-
vulsed he called down imprecations
from the stars and the gulfs beyond
the stars so that even surama shud-
dered made an elder sign that no
book of history records and forgot to
chuckle



georgina soothed her brothers
hurt as best she could he had
come home mentally and physically
exhausted and thrown himself on
the library lounge and in that
gloomy room little by little the
faithful sister had taken in the
almost incredible news her con-
solations were instantaneous and ten-
der and she made him realize how
vast though unconscious a tribute to
his greatness the attacks persecution
and dismissal all were he had tried
to cultivate the indifference she
preached and could have done so had
personal dignity alone been involved
but the loss of scientific opportunity
was more than he could calmly bear
and he sighed again and again as he
repeated how three months more of
study in the prison might have given
him at last the long-sought bacillus
which would make all fever a thing
of the past
the last test



  then georgina tried another mode
of cheering and told him that surely
the prison board would send for him
again if the fever did not abate or if
it broke out with increased force
but even this was ineffective and
clarendon answered only in a string
of bitter ironic and half-meaningless
little sentences whose tone showed
all too clearly how deeply despair
and resentment had bitten

  abate break out again oh
itll abate all right at least theyll
think it has abated theyd think
anything no matter what happens
ignorant eyes see nothing and bun-
glers are never discoverers science
never shows her face to that sort
and they call themselves doctors
best of all fancy that ass jones in
charge 

  ceasing with a quick sneer he
laughed so demoniacally that geor-
gina shivered

  the days that followed were dis-
mal ones indeed at the clarendon
mansion depression stark and un-
relieved had taken hold of the doc-
tors usually tireless mind and he
would even have refused food had
not georgina forced it upon him
his great notebook of observations
lay unopened on the library table
and his little gold syringe of anti-
fever serum-a clever device of his
own with ti self-contained reservoir
attached to a broad gold finger ring
and single-pressure action peculiar
to itself-rested idly in a small
leather case beside it vigor ambi-
tion and the desire for study and
observation seemed to have died with-
in him and he made no inquiries
about his clinic where hundreds of
germ cultures stood in their orderly
phials awaiting his attention

  the countless animals held for
experiments played lively and well-
fed in the early spring sunshine and
as georgina strolled out through the
rose-arbor to the cages she felt a
strangely incongruous sense of happi-
ness about her she knew though

how tragically transient that happi-
ness must be since the start of new
work would soon make all these small
creatures unwilling martyrs to sci-
ence knowing this she glimpsed a
sort of compensating element in her
brothers inaction and encouraged
him to keep on in a rest he needed so
badly the eight tibetan servants
moved noiselessly about each as im-
peccably effective as usual and
georgina saw to it that the order of
the household did not suffer because
of the masters relaxation

  study and starward ambition laid
aside in slippered and dressing-
gowned indifference clarendon was
content to let georgina treat him as
an infant he met her maternal
fussiness with a slow sad smile and
always obeyed her multitude of or-
ders and precepts a kind of faint
wistful felicity came over the languid
household amidst which the only dis-
senting note was supplied by surama
he indeed was miserable and looked
often with sullen and resentful eyes
at the sunny serenity in georginas
face his only joy had been the tur-
moil of experiment and he missed
the routine of seizing the fated ani-
mals bearing them to the clinic in
clutching talons and watching them
with hot brooding gaze and evil
chuckles as they gradually fell into
the final coma with wide-opened red-
rimmed eyes and swollen tongue loll-
ing from froth-covered mouth

  now he was seemingly driven to
desperation by the sight of the care-
free creatures in their cages and fre-
quently came to ask clarendon if
there were any orders finding the
doctor apathetic and unwilling to be-
gin work he would go away mutter-
ing under his breath and glaring
curses upon everything stealing with
catlike tread to his own quarters in
the basement where his voice would
sometimes ascend in deep muffled
rhythms of blasphemous strangeness
and uncomfortably ritualistic sugges-
tion


weird tales

  all this wore on georginas nerves
but not by any means so gravely as
her brothers continued lassitude it-
self the duration of the state
alarmed her and little by little she
lost the air of cheerfulness which had
so provoked the clinic-man herself
skilled in medicine she found the doc-
tors condition highly unsatisfactory
from an alienists point of view and
she now feared as much from his ab-
sence of interest and activity as she
had formerly feared from his fanati-
cal zeal and overstudy was linger-
ing melancholy about to turn the
once brilliant man of intellect into an
innocuous imbecile

ttien toward the end of may
came the sudden change geor-
gina always recalled the smallest de-
tails connected with it details as
trivial as the box delivered to surama
the day before postmarked algiers
and emitting a most unpleasant odor
and the sharp sudden thunderstorm
rare in the extreme for california
which sprang up that night as su-
rama chanted his rituals behind his
locked basement door in a droning
chest-voice louder and more intense
than usual

  it was a sunny day and she had
been in the garden gathering flowers
for the dining-room re-entering the
house she glimpsed her brother in the
library fully dressed and seated at
the table alternately consulting the
notes in his thick observation book
and making fresh entries with brisk
assured strokes of the pen he was
alert and vital and there was a satis-
fying resilience about his movements
as he now and then turned a page or
reached for a book from the rear of
the great table delighted and re-
lieved georgina hastened to deposit
her flowers in the dining-room and re-
turn  but when she reached the
library again she found that her
brother was gone

  she knew of course that he must
be in the clinic at work and rejoiced

to think that his old mind and pur-
pose had snapped back into place
realizing it would be of no use to
delay the luncheon for him she ate
alone and set aside a bite to be kept
warm in case of his return at an odd
moment but he did not come he
was making up for lost time and was
still in the great stout-pianked clinic
when she went for a stroll through the
rose-arbor

  as she walked among the fragrant
blossoms she saw surama fetching
animals for the test she wished she
could notice him less for he always
made her shudder but her very dread
had sharpened her eyes and ears
where he was concerned ne always
went hatless around the yard and the
total hairlessness of his head enhanced
his skelctonlike aspect horribly now
she heard a faint chuckle as he took a
small monkey from its cage against
the wall and carried it to the clinic
his long bony fingers pressing so
cruelly into its furry sides that it
cried out in frightened anguish the
sight sickened her and brought her
walk to an end her inmost soul re-
belled at the ascendancy this creature
had gained over her brother and she
reflected bitterly that the two had al-
most changed places as master and
servant

  night came without clarendons re-
turn to the house and georgina con-
cluded that he was absorbed in one of
his very longest sessions which meant
total disregard of time she hated to
retire without a talk with him about
his sudden recovery but finally feel-
ing it would be futile to wait up she
wrote a cheerful note and propped it
before his chair on the library table
then started resolutely for bed

  she was not quite asleep when she
heard the outer door open and shut
so it had not been an all-night session
after all determined to see that her
brother had a meal before retiring
she rose slipped on a robe and
descended to the library halting only
when she heard voices from behind
the last test



the half-opened door clarendon and
surama were talking and she waited
till the clinic-man might go

  surama however showed no in-
clination to depart and indeed the
whole heated tenor of the discourse
seemed to bespeak absorption and
promise length georgina though
she had not meant to listen could not
help catching a phrase now and then
and presently became aware of a sin-
ister undercurrent which frightened
her very much without being wholly
clear to her her brothers voice
nervous incisive held her notice with
disquieting persistence

  but anyway he was saying we
havent enough animals for another
day and you know how hard it is to
get a decent supply at short notice
it seems silly to waste so much effort
on comparative trash when human
specimens could be had with just a
little extra care

  georgina sickened at the possible
implication and caught at the hall
rack to steady herself surama was
replying in that deep hollow tone
which seemed to echo with the evil of
a thousand ages and a thousand plan-
ets

   steady steady-what a child you
are with your haste and impatience
you crowd things so when youve
lived as i have so that a whole life
will seem only an hour you wont be
so fretful about a day or week or
month you work too fast youve
plenty of specimens in the cages for a
full week if youll only go at a sen-
sible rate you might even begin on
the other material if youd be sure
not to overdo it

  never mind my haste the reply
was snapped out sharply i have my
own methods i dont want to use our
material if i can help it for i prefer
them as they are and youd better
be careful of them anyway-you know
the knives those sly dogs carry

  suramas deep chuckle came

  dont worry about that the
brutes eat dont they well i can

get you one any time you need it
but go slow-with the boy gone there
are only eight and now that youve
lost san quentin itll be hard to get
new ones by the wholesale id advise
you to start in on tsanpo-hes the
least use to you as he is and-

 but that was all georgina heard
transfixed by a hideous dread from
the thoughts this talk excited she
nearly sank to the floor where she
stood and was scarcely able to drag
herself up the stairs and into her
room what was the evil monster
surama planning into what was he
guiding her brother what mon-
strous circumstances lay behind these
cryptic sentences a thousand phan-
toms of darkness and menace danced
before her eyes and she flung herself
upon the bed without hope of sleep
one thought above the rest stood out
with fiendish prominence and she al-
most screamed aloud as it beat itself
into her brain with renewed force
then nature kinder than she expect-
ed intervened at last closing her
eyes in a dead faint she did not awake
till morning nor did any fresh night-
mare come to join the lasting one
which the overheard words had
brought

xith the morning sunshine came
  a lessening of the tension what
happens in the night when one is
tired often reaches the consciousness
in distorted forms and georgina
could see that her brain must have
given strange color to scraps of com-
mon medical conversation to sup-
pose her brother-only son of the
gentle frances schuyler clarendon-
guilty of savage sacrifices in the name
of science would be to do an injustice
to their blood and she decided to omit
all mention of her trip downstairs lest
alfred ridicule her fantastic notions

  when she reached the breakfast table
she found that clarendon was already
gone and regretted that not even this
second morning had given her a
chance to congratulate him on his re-


weird tales

vived activity quietly taking the
breakfast served by stone-deaf old
margarita the mexican cook she read
the morning paper and seated herself
with some needlework by the sitting-
room window overlooking the great
yard all was silent out there and
she could see that the last of the ani-
mal cages had been emptied science
was served and the lime pit held all
that was left of the once pretty and
lively little creatures this slaughter
had always grieved her but she had
never complained since she knew it
was all for humanity being a scien-
tist s sister she used to say to herself
was like being the sister of a soldier
who kills to save his countrymen from
their foes

  after luncheon georgina resumed
her post by the window and had been
busily sewing for some time when the
sound of a pistol shot from the yard
caused her to look out in alarm
there not far from the clinic she saw
the ghastly form of surama a revol-
ver in his hand and his skull-face
twisted into a strange expression as he
ehuckled at a cowering figure robed in
black silk and carrying a long tibetan
knife it was the servant tsanpo and
as she recognized the shriveled face
georgina remembered horribly what
she had overheard the night before
the sun flashed on the polished blade
and suddenly suramas revolver spat
once more this time the knife flew
from the mongols hand and surama
glanced greedily at his shaking and
bewildered prey

  then tsanpo glancing quickly at
his unhurt hand and at the fallen
knife sprang nimbly away from the
stealthily approaching clinic-man and
made a dash for the house surama
however was too swift for him and
caught him in a single leap seizing
ixis shoulder and almost crushing him
for a moment the tibetan tried to
struggle but surama lifted him like
an animal by the scruff of the neck
and bore him off toward the clinic
georgina heard him chuckling and

taunting the man in his own tongue
and saw the yellow face of the victim
twist and quiver with fright sud-
denly realizing against her own will
what was taking place a great horror
mastered her and she fainted for the
second time within twenty-four hours

  when consciousness returned the
golden light of late afternoon was
flooding the room georgina picking
up her fallen work-basket and scat-
tered materials was lost in a daze of
doubt but finally felt convinced that
the scene which had overcome her
must have been all too tragically real
her worst fears then were horrible
truths what to do about it nothing
in her experience could tell her and
she was vaguely thankful that her
brother did not appear she must
talk to him but not now she could
not talk to anybody now and
thinking shudderingly of the mon-
strous happening behind those barred
clinic windows she crept into bed for
a long night of anguished sleepless-
ness

rising haggardly on the following
day georgina saw the doctor for
the first time since his recovery he
was bustling about preoecupiedly
circulating between the house and the
clinic and paying little attention to
anything besides his work there
was no chance for the dreaded inter-
view and clarendon did not even no-
tice his sisters worn-out aspect and
hesitant manner

  in the evening she heard him in the
library talking to himself in a fashion
most unusual for him and she felt
that he was under a great strain
which might culminate in the return
of his apathy entering the room she
tried to calm him withojit referring
to any trying subject and forced a
steadying cup of bouillon upon him
finally she asked gently what was dis-
tressing him and waited anxiously
for his reply hoping to hear that su-
rama s treatment of the poor tibetan
had horrified and outraged him
the last test



  there was a note of fretfulness in
his voice as he responded

  whats distressing me good
god georgina what isntf look
at the cages and see if yon have to
ask again cleaned out-milked dry
-not a cursed specimen left and a
line of the most important bacterial
cultures incubating in their tubes
without a chance to do an ounce of
good days work wasted-whole
program set back-its enough to
drive a man mad how shall i ever
get anywhere if i cant scrape up
some decent subjects

  georgina stroked his forehead

  i think you ought to rest a while
a dear

  he moved away

    rest  thats good thats damn
good what else have i been doing
but resting and vegetating and star-
ing blankly into space for the last
fifty or a hundred or a thousand
years just as i manage to shake off
the clouds i have to run short of
material-and then im told to lapse
back again into drooling stupefac-
tion god and all the while some
sneaking thief is probably working
with my data and getting ready to
come out ahead of me with the credit
for my own work i  lose by a neck
-some fool with the proper specimens
will get the prize when one week more
with even half-adequate facilities
would see me through with flying
colors  

  his voice rose querulously and
there was an overtone of mental
strain which georgina did not like
she answered softly yet not so softly
as to hint at the soothing of a psycho-
pathic case

  but youre killing yourself with
this worry and tension and if you re
dead how can you do your work

  he gave a smile that was almost a
sneer

  i guess a week or a month-all the
time i need-wouldnt quite finish me
and it doesnt much matter what be-
comes of me or any other individual

in the end science is what must be
served-science-the austere cause of
human knowledge im like the mon-
keys and birds and guinea-pigs i use
-just a cog in the machine to be used
to the advantage of the whole they
had to be killed-i may have to be
killed-what of it isnt the cause
we serve worth that and more

  georgina sighed for a moment
she wondered whether after all this
ceaseless round of slaughter really
was worth while

  but are you absolutely sure your
discovery will be enough of a boon to
humanity to warant these sacrifices

  clarendons eyes flashed danger-
ously

  humanity what the deuce is
humanity science dolts just
individuals over and over again hu-
manity is made for preachers to whom
it means the blindly credulous hu-
manity is made for the predatory
rich to whom it speaks in terms of
dollars and cents humanity is made
for the politician to whom it signifies
collective power to be used to his ad-
vantage what is humanity noth-
ing thank god that crude illusion
doesnt last what a grown man
worships is truth-knowledge-sci-
ence-light-the rending of the veil
and the pushing back of the shadow
knowledge the juggernaut there is
death in our own ritual wc must
kill-dissect-destroy-and all for the
sake of discovery-the worship of the
ineffable light the goddess science
demands it we test a doubtful poi-
son by killing how else nothoiight
for self-just knowledge-the effect
must be known  

  his voice trailed off in a kind of
temporary exhaustion and georgina
shuddered slightly

  but this is horrible al you
shouldnt think of it that way

  clarendon cackled sardonically in
a manner which stirred odd and re-
pugnant associations in his sisters
mind


weird tales

  horrible yon think what t say
is horrible you ought to hear su-
rama  i tell you things were known
to the priests of atlantis that would
make you drop dead of fright if you
heard a hint of them knowledge
was knowledge a hundred thousand
years ago when our especial fore-
bears were shambling about asia as
speechless semi-apes they know
something of it in the hoggar region
-there are rumors in the farther up-
lands of tibet-and once i heard an
old man in china calling on yog-
sothoth-

  he turned pale and made a curi-
ous sign in the air with his extended
forefinger georgina felt genuinely
alarmed but became somewhat calmer
as his speech took a less fantastic
form

  yes it may be horrible but its
glorious too the pursuit of knowl-
edge i mean certainly theres no
slovenly sentiment connected with it
doesnt nature kill-constantly and
remorselessly-and are any but fools
horrified at the struggle killings
are necessary they are the glory of
science we learn something from
them and we cant sacrifice learning
to sentiment hear the sentimental-
ists howl against vaccination they
fear it will kill the child well what
if it does  how else can we discover
the laws of disease concerned as a
scientists sister you ought to know
better than to prate sentiment you
ought to help my work instead of
hindering it i

  but al protested georgina i
havent the slightest intention of hin-
dering your work havent i always
tried to help as much as i could i
am ignorant i suppose and cant
help very actively but at least im
proud of you-proud for my own
sake and for the familys sake-and
ive always tried to smooth the way
youve given me credit for that many
a time

  clarendon looked at her keenly

  yes he said jerkily as he rose

and strode from the room youre
right youve always tried to help as
best you knew you may yet have a
chance to help still more

  georgina seeing him disappear
through the front door followed him
into the yard some distance away a
lantern was shining through the
trees and as they approached it they
saw surama bending over a large ob-
ject stretched on the ground clar-
endon advancing gave a short grunt
but when georgina saw what it was
she rushed up with a shriek it was
dick the great st bernard and he
was lying still with reddened eyes and
protruding tongue

  hes sick al she cried do
something for him quick  

  the doctor looked at surama who
had uttered something in a tongue un-
known to georgina

  take him to the clinic he or-
dered im afraid dicks caught the
fever  

  surama took up the dog as he had
taken poor tsanpo the day before
and carried him silently to the build-
ing near the mall he did not
chuckle this time but glanced at clar-
endon with what appeared to be real
anxiety it almost seemed to geor-
gina that surama was asking the doc-
tor to save her pet

  clarendon however made no move
to follow but stood still for a moment
and then sauntered slowly toward the
house georgina astonished at such
callousness kept up a running fire of
entreaties on dicks behalf but it was
of no use without paying the slight-
est attention to her pleas he made di-
rectly for the library and began to
read in a large old book which had
lain face down on the table she put
her hand on his shoulder as he sat
there but he did not speak or turn his
head he only kept on reading and
georgina glancing curiously over his
shoulder wondered in what strange
alphabet this brass-bound tome was
written
the last test



  in the cavernous parlor across the
hall sitting alone in the dark a quar-
ter of an hour later georgina came to
her decision something was gravely
wrong-just what and to what ex-
tent she scarcely dared formulate to
herself-and it was time that she
called in some stronger force to help
her of course it must be james he
was powerful and capable and his
sympathy and affection would show
him the right thing to do he had
known a always and would under-
stand

  it was by this time rather late but
georgina had resolved on action
across the hall the light still shone
from the library and she looked wist-
fully at the doorway as she quietly
donned a hat and left the house out-
side the gloomy mansion and forbid-
ding grounds it was only a short walk
to jackson street where by good luck
she found a carriage to take her to the
western union telegraph office there
she carefully wrote out a message to
james dalton in sacramento asking
him to come at once to san francisco
on a matter of the greatest importance
to them all



dalton was frankly perplexed by
georginas sudden message he
had had no word from the clarendons
since that stormy february evening
when alfred had declared him an
outsider to his home and he in turn
had studiously refrained from com-
municating even when he had
longed to express sympathy after the
doctors summary ousting from of-
fice he had fought hard to frus-
trate the politicians and keep the ap-
pointive power and was bitterly
sorry to watch the unseating of a
man who despite recent estrange-
ments still represented to him the
ultimate ideal of scientific compe-
tence

  now with this clearly frightened
summons before him he could not
imagine what had happened he

knew though that georgina was not
one to lose her head or send forth a
needless alarm hence he wasted no
time but took the overland which
left sacramento within the hour go-
ing at once to his club and sending
word to georgina by a messenger
that he was in town and wholly at
her service

  meanwhile things had been quies-
cent at the clarendon home not-
withstanding the doctors continued
taciturnity and his absolute refusal
to report on the dogs condition
shadows of evil seemed omnipresent
and thickening but for the moment
there was a lull georgina was re-
lieved to get daltons message and
learn that he was close at hand and
sent back word that she would call
him when necessity arose amidst
all the gathering tension some faint
compensating element seemed mani-
fest and georgina finally decided
that it was the absence of the lean
tibetans whose stealthy sinuous
ways and disturbing exotic aspect
had always annoyed her they had
vanished all at once and old mar-
garita the sole visible servant left in
the house told her they were helping
their master and surama at the
clinic

  the following morning-the th
of may-long to be remembered-
was dark and lowering and geoi-
gina felt the precarious calm wearing
thin she did not see her brother at
all but knew he was in the clinic
hard at work at something despite
the lack of specimens he had be-
wailed she wondered how poor
tsanpo was getting along and
whether he had really been subject-
ed to any serious inoculation but it
must be confessed that she wondered
more about dick she longed to
know whether surama had done any-
thing for the faithful dog amidst his
masters oddly callous indifference
suramas apparent solicitude on the
night of dicks seizure had im-
pressed her greatly giving her per-


weird tales

haps the kindliest feeling she had
ever had for the detested clinic-man
now as the day advanced she found
herself thinking more and more of
dick till at last her harassed nerves
finding in this one detail a sort of
symbolic summation of the whole
horror that lay upon the household
could stand the suspense no longer

  up to that time she had always re-
spected alfreds imperious wish that
he be never approached or disturbed
at the clinic but as this fateful af-
ternoon advanced her resolution to
break through the barrier grew
stronger and stronger finally she
set out with determined face cross-
ing the yard and entering the un-
locked vestibule of the forbidden
structure with the fixed intention of
discovering how the dog was or of
knowing the reason for her brothers
secrecy

 the inner door as usual was
locked and behind it she heard
voices in heated conversation when
her knocking brought no response
she rattled the knob as loudly as pos-
sible but still the voices argued
on unheeding they belonged of
course to surama and her brother
and as she stood there trying to at-
tract attention she could not help
catch something of their drift fate
had made her for the second time an
eavesdropper and once more the
matter she overheard seemed likely
to tax her mental poise and nervous
endurance to their ultimate bounds
alfred and surama were plainly
quarreling with increasing violence
and the purport of their speech was
enough to arouse the wildest fears
and confirm the gravest apprehen-
sions georgina shivered as her
brothers voice mounted shrilly to
dangerous heights of fanatical ten-
sion

 you damn you-youre a fine
one to talk defeat and moderation to
me who started all this anyway
did i have any idea of your cursed
devil-gods and elder world did i

ever in my life think of your damned

spaces beyond the stars and your
crawling chaos nyarlathotep  i was
a normal scientific man confound
you till i was fool enough to drag
you out of the vaults with your devil-
ish atlantean secrets you egged me
on and now you want to cut me off
you loaf around doing nothing and
telling me to go slow when you
might just as well as not be going out
and getting material you know
damn well that i dont know how to
go about such things whereas you
must have been an old hand at it be-
fore the earth was made its like
you you damned walking corpse to
start something you wont or cant
finish

  suramas evil chuckle came

 youre insane clarendon
thats the only reason i let you rave
on when i could send you to hell in
three minutes enough is enough
and youve certainly had enough ma-
terial for any novice at your stage
youve had all im going to got you
anyhow youre only a maniac on
the subject now-what a cheap
crazy thing to sacrifice even your
poor sisters pet dog when you
could have spared him as well as not
you cant look at any living thing
now without wanting to jab that
gold syringe into it no-dick had
to go where the mexican boy went-
where tsanpo and the other seven
went-where all the animals went
what a pupil youre no fun any
more-youve lost your nerve you
set out to control things and theyre
controlling you im about done
with you clarendon i thought you
had the stuff in you but you havent
its about time i tried somebody else
im afraid youll have to go

  in the doctors shouted reply there
was both fear and frenzy

 be careful you - there

arc powers against your powers-
i didnt go to china for nothing
and there are things in alhazreds
azif which werent known in at-
the last test



lantis weve both meddled in dan-
gerous things but you neednt think
you know all my resources how
about the nemesis of flame i
talked in yemen with an old man
who had come back alive from the
crimson desert-he had seen irem
the city of pillars and had wor-
shiped at the underground shrines of
nug and yeb-la shub-niggurath  
through clarendons shrieking
falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the
clinic-man

    shut up you fool do you sup-
pose your grotesque nonsense has
any weight with me words and
formula - words and formulae -
what do they all mean to one who
has the  substance behind them 
were in a material sphere now and
subject to material laws you have
your fever i have my revolver
youll get no specimens and ill get
no fever so long as i have you in
front of me with this gun between  
that avas all georgina could hear
she felt her senses reeling and
staggered out of the vestibule for a
saving breath of the lowering out-
side air she saw that the crisis had
come at last and that help must now
arrive quickly if her brother was to
be saved from unknown gulfs of
madness and mystery summoning
up all her reserve energy she man-
aged to reach the house and get to
the library where she scrawled a
hasty note for margarita to take to
james dalton

when the old woman had gone
georgina had just strength
enough to cross to the lounge and
sink weakly down into a sort of semi-
stupor there she lay for what
seemed like years conscious only of
the fantastic creeping up of the twi-
light from the lower corners of the
great dismal room and plagued by a
thousand shadowy shapes of terror
which filed with fantasmal half-
limned pageantry through her tor-
tured and stifled brain dusk deep-

ened into darkness and still the spell
held then a firm tread sounded in
the hall and she heard someone en-
ter the room and fumble at the
match-safe her heart almost stopped
beating as the gas-jets of the
chandelier flared up one by one but
then she saw that the arrival was her
brother relieved to the bottom of
her heart that he was still alive she
gave vent to an involuntary sigh
profound long-drawn and tremu-
lous and lapsed at last into kindly
oblivion

  at the sound of that sigh claren-
don turned in alarm toward the
lounge and was inexpressibly
shocked to see the pale and uncon-
scious form of his sister there her
face had a deathlike quality that
frightened his inmost spirit and he
flung himself on his knees by her
side awake to a realization of what
her passing away would mean to
him long unused to private prac-
tise amidst his ceaseless quest for
truth he had lost the physicians in-
stinct of first aid and could only call
out her name and chafe her wrists
mechanically as fear and grief pos-
sessed him then he thought of
water and ran to the dining-room
for a carafe stumbling about in a
darkness which seemed to harbor
vague terrors he was some time in
finding what he sought but at last
he clutched it in shaking hand and
hastened back to dash the cold fluid
in georginas face the method was
crude but effective she stirred
sighed a second time and finally
opened her eyes

  you are alive he cried and
put his chcek to hers as she stroked
his head maternally she was almost
glad she had fainted for the circum-
stance seemed to have dispelled the
strange alfred and brought her own
biother back to her she sat up
slowly and tried to reassure him

  im all right al just give me
a glass of water its a sin to waste
it this way-to say nothing of spoil-


weird tales

ing my waist is that the way to
behave every time your sister drops
off for a nap you neednt think
im going to be sick for i havent
time for such nonsense  

  alfreds eyes showed that her cool
common-sense speech had had its ef-
fect his brotherly panic dissolved
in an instant and instead there came
into his face a vague calculating ex-
pression as if some marvelous pos-
sibility had just dawned upon him
as she watched the subtle waves of
cunning and appraisal pass fleeting-
ly over his countenance she became
less and less certain that her mode of
reassurance had been a wise one and
before he spoke she found herself
shivering at something she could not
define a keen medical instinct al-
most told her that his moment of
sanity had passed and that he was
now once more the unrestrained
fanatic for scientific research there
was something morbid in the quick
narrowing of his eyes at her casual
mention of good health what was-
he thinking to what unnatural ex-
treme was his passion for experiment
about to be pushed wherein lay
the special significance of her pure
blood and absolutely flawless organic
state none of these misgivings
however troubled georgina for more
than a second and she was quite
natural and unsuspicious as she felt
her brothers steady fingers at her
pulse

 youre a bit feverish georgie
he said in a precise elaborately re-
strained voice as he looked profes-
sionally into her eyes

  why nonsense im all right
she replied one would think you
were on the watch for fever patients
just for the sake of showing off
your discovery it would be poetic
though if you could make your final
proof and demonstration by curing
your own sister  

  clarendon started violently and
guiltily had she suspected his
wish had he muttered anything

aloud he looked at her closely and
saw that she had no inkling of the
truth she smiled up sweetly into
his face and patted his hand as he
stood by the side of the lounge
then he took a small oblong leather
case from his vest pocket and taking
out a little gold syringe he began
fingering it thoughtfully pushing
the piston speculatively in and out
of the empty cylinder

  i wonder he began with suave
sententiousness whether you would
really be willing to help science in
-something like that way-if the
need arose whether you would
have the devotion to offer yourself
to the cause of medicine as a sort of
jephthahs daughter if you knew it
meant the absolute perfection and
completion of my work

  georgina catching the odd and
unmistakable glitter in her brothers
eyes knew at last that her worst
feats were true there was nothing
to do now but keep him quiet at all
hazards and to pray that margarita
had found james dalton at his club

  you look tired a dear she
said gently why not take a little
morphia and get some of the sleep
you need so badly

  he replied with a kind of crafty
deliberation

  yes youre right im worn out
and so are you each of us needs
a good sleep morphine is just the
thing-wait till i go and fill the
syringe and well both take a proper
dose  

  still fingering the empty syringe
he walked softly out of the room
georgina looked about her with the
aimlessness of desperation ears
alert for any sign of possible help
she thought she heard margarita
again in the basement kitchen and
rose to ring the bell in an effort to
learn of the fate of her message the
old servant answered her summons
at once and declared she had given
the message at the club hours ago
governor dalton had been out but
the last test



the clerk had promised to deliver the
note at the very moment of his ar-
rival

  margarita waddled below stairs
again but still clarendon did not
reappear what was he doing
what was he planning she had
heard the outer door slam so knew
he must be at the clinic had he
forgotten his original intention with
the vacillating mind of madness
the suspense grew almost unbear-
able and georgina had to keep her
teeth clenched tightly to avoid
screaming

it was the gate bell which rang
simultaneously in house and clin-
ic that broke the tension at last
she heard the catlike tread of su-
rama on the walk as he left the clinic
to answer it and then with an
almost hysterical sigh of relief she
caught the firm familiar accents of
dalton in conversation with the sin-
ister attendant rising she almost
tottered to meet- him as he loomed
up in the library doorway and for
a moment no word was spoken while
he kissed her hand in his courtly
old-school fashion then georgina
burst forth into a torrent of hurried
explanation telling all that had hap-
pened all she had glimpsed and over-
heard and all she feared and
suspected

  dalton listened gravely and eom-
prehendingly his first bewilderment
gradually giving place to astonish-
ment sympathy and resolution the
message held by a careless clerk had
been slightly delayed and had found
him appropriately enough in the
midst of a warm lounging-room dis-
cussion about clarendon a fellow-
member dr macneil had brought
in a medical journal with an article
well calculated to disturb the devot-
ed scientist and dalton had just
asked to keep the paper for future
reference when the message was
handed him at last abandoning his
half-formed plan to take dr mac-

neil into his confidence regarding
alfred he called at once for his hat
and stick and lost not a moment in
getting a cab for the clarendon
home

  surama he thought appeared
alarmed at recognizing him though
he had chuckled as usual when strid-
ing off again toward the clinic dal-
ton always recalled suramas stride
and chuckle on this ominous night
for he was never to see the unearthly
creature again as the chuekler en-
tered the clinic vestibule his deep
guttural gurgles seemed to blend
with some low mutterings of t hunder
which troubled the far horizon

  when dalton had heard all geor-
gina had to say and learned that
alfred was expected back at any
moment with an hypodermic dose of
morphine he decided he had better
talk with the doctor alone advising
georgina to retire to her room and
await developments he walked about
the gloomy library scanning the
shelves and listening for clarendons
nervous footstep on the clinic path
outside the vast rooms cornels
were dismal despite the chandelier
and the closer dalton looked at his
friends choice of books the less he
liked them it was not the balanced
collection of a normal physician
biologist or man of general culture
there were too many volumes on
doubtful borderland themes dark
speculations and forbidden rituals of

  the great notebook of observa-
tions on the table was unwholesome
too the handwriting had a neurot-
ic cast and the spirit of the entries
was far from reassuring long pas-
sages were inscribed in crabbed
greek characters and as dalton
marshaled his linguistic memory for
their translation he gave a sudden
start and wished his college strug-
gles with xenophon and homer had
been more conscientious there was

something wrong - something hid-
eously wrong-here and the governor
sank limply into the chair by the
table as he pored more and more
closely over the doctors barbarous
greek then a sound came start-
lingly near and he jumped nervous-
ly at a hand laid sharply on his
shoulder

  what may i ask is the cause of
this intrusion you might have
stated your business to surama

  clarendon was standing icily by
the chair the little gold syringe in
one hand he seemed very calm and
rational and dalton fancied for a
moment that georgina must have ex-
aggerated his condition how too
could a rusty scholar be absolutely
sure about these greek entries the
governor decided to be very cautious
in his interview and thanked the
lucky chance which had placed a
specious pretext in his coat pocket
he was very cool and assured as he
rose to reply

  i didnt think youd care to have
things dragged before a subordinate
but i thought you ought to see this
article at once

  he drew forth the magazine given
him by dr macneil and handed it to
clarendon

  on page -you see the head-
ing black fever conquered by new
serum its by dr miller of phila-
delphia-and he thinks hes got
ahead of you with your cure they
were discussing it at the club and
macneil thought the exposition very
convincing i as a layman couldnt
pretend to judge but at all events i
thought you oughtnt to miss a
chance to digest the thing while its
fresh if youre busy of course i
wont disturb you-

  clarendon cut in sharply

  im going to give my sister an
hypodermic-shes not quite well-
but ill look at what that quack has
to say when i get back i know mil-
ler-a damn sneak and incompetent

-and i dont believe he has the
brains to steal my methods from the
little hes seen of them

  dalton suddenly felt a wave of in-
tuition warning him that georgina
must not receive that intended dose
there was something sinister about
it from what she had said alfred
must have been an inordinately long
time preparing it far longer than
was needed for the dissolving of a
morphine tablet he decided to hold
his host as long as possible mean-
while testing his attitude in a more
or less subtle way

  im sorry georgina isnt well
are you sure that the injection will
do her good that it wont do her
any harm

  clarendons spasmodic start showed
that something had been struck home

    do her harm   he cried   dont
be absurd you know georgina must
be in the best of health-the very
best i say-in order to serve science
as a clarendon should serve it she
at least appreciates the fact that she
is my sister she deems no sacrifice
too great in my service she is a
priestess of truth and discovery as
i am a priest

  he paused in his shrill tirade wild-
eyed and somewhat out of breath
dalton could see that his attention
had been momentarily shifted

  but let me see what this cursed
quaek has to say he continued if
he thinks his pseudo-medical rhetoric
can take a real doctor in he is even
simpler than i thought

 clarendon nervously found the
right page and began reading as he
stood there clutching his syringe
dalton wondered what the real facts
were macneil had assured him that
the author was a pathologist of the
highest standing and that whatever
errors the article might have the
mind behind it was powerful erudite
and absolutely honorable and sin-
cere
the last test



watching the doctor as he read
dalton saw the thin bearded
face suddenly grow pale the great
eyes blazed and the pages crackled
in the tenser grip of the long lean
fingers a perspiration broke out on
the high ivory-white forehead where
the hair was already thinning and the
reader sank gaspingly into the chair
his visitor had vacated as he kept on
with his devouring of the text then
came a wild scream as from a hunted
beast and clarendon lurched for-
ward on the table his outflung arms
sweeping books and papers before
thorn as consciousness went dark like
a wind-quenched candle-flame

  dalton springing to help his strick-
en friend raised the slim form and
tilted it back in the chair seeing the
carafe on the floor near the lounge
he dashed some water into the twist-
ed face and was rewarded by seeing
the large eyes slowly open they
were sane eyes now-deep and sad
and unmistakably sane-and dalton
felt awed in the presence of a trag-
edy whose ultimate depth he could
never hope or dare to plumb

  the golden hypodermic was still
clutched in the loan left hand and as
clarendon drew a deop shuddering
breath he unclosed his fingers and
studied the glittering thing that
rolled about on his palm then he
spoke-slowly and with the ineffable
sadness of utter absolute despair

 thanks jimmy im quite all
right but theres much to be done
you asked me a while back if this
shot of morphia would do georgie
any harm im in a position now to
tell you that it wont

  he turned a small screw in the
syringe and laid a finger on the pis-
ton at the same time pulling with his
left hand at the skin of his own neck
dalton cried out in alarm as a light-
ning motion of his right hand inject-
ed the contents of the cylinder into
the ridge of distended flesh

 good lord al what have you
done

  clarendon smiled gently-a smile
almost of peace and resignation dif-
ferent indeed from the sardonic sneer
of the past few weeks

 you ought to know jimmy if
youve still the judgment that made
you a governor you must have
pieced together enough from my
notes to realize that theres nothing
else to do with your marks in greek
back at columbia i guess you
couldnt have missed much all i can
say is that its true

  james i dont like to pass blame
along but its only right to tell you
that surama got me into this i cant
tell you who or what he is for i dont
fully know myself and what i do
know is stuff that no sane person
ought to know but i will say that i
dont consider him a human being in
the fullest sense and that im not
sure whether or not hes alive as we
know life

  you think im talking nonsense
i wish i were but the whole hideous
mess is damnably real i started out
in life with a clean mind and pur-
pose i wanted to rid the world of
fever i tried and failed-and t wish
to god i had been honest enough to
say that id failed dont let my old
talk of science deceive you james-
i found no antitoxin and was never
even half on the track of one

  dont look so shaken up old fel-
low  a veteran politician-fighter like
you must have seen plenty of un-
maskings before i tell you i never
had even the start of a fever cure
but my studies had taken me into
some queer places and it was just
my damned luck to listen to the
stories of some still queerer people
james if you ever wish any man
well tell him to keep clear of the
ancient hidden places of the earth
old backwaters are dangerous-
things are handed down there that
dont do healthy people any good i
talked too much with old priests and
mystics and got to hoping i might


weird tales

achieve things in dark ways that i
couldnt achieve in lawful ways

  i shant tell you just what i
mean for if i did id be as bad as the
old priests that were the ruin of me
all i need say is that after what ive
learned i shudder at the thought of
the world and what its been through
the world is cursed old james and
there have been whole chapters lived
and closed before the dawn of our
organic life and the geologic eras
connected with it its an awful
thought-whole forgotten cycles of
evolution with beings and races and
wisdom and diseases-all lived
through and gone before the first
ameba ever stirred in the tropic seas
geology tells us about

  i said gone but i didnt quite
mean that it would have been better
that way but it wasnt quite so in
places traditions have kept on-i
cant tell you how-and certain
archaic life-forms have managed to
struggle thinly down the eons in
hidden spots there were cults you
know-bands of evil priests in lands
now buried under the sea atlantis
was the hotbed that was a terrible
place if heaven is merciful no
one will ever drag up that horror
from the deep

  it had a colony though that
didnt sink and when you get too
confidential with one of the tuareg
priests in africa hes likely to tell
you wild tales about it-tales
that connect up with whispers youll
hear among the mad lamas and
flighty yak-drivers on the secret
table-lands of asia id heard all the
common tales and whispers when i
came on the big one what that was
youll never know-but it pertained
to somebody or something that had
come down from a blasphemously
long time ago and could be made to
live again-or seem alive again-
through certain processes that werent
very clear to the man who told me

  now james in spite of my con-
fession about the fever you know

im not bad as a doctor i plugged

hard at medicine and soaked up
about as much as the next man-may-
be a little more because down there
in the hoggar country i did some-
thing no priest had ever been able to
do they led me blindfolded to a
place that had been sealed up for
generations-and i came back with
surama

 easy james i know what you
want to say how does he know all
he knows-why does he speak en-
glish-or any other language for
that matter-without an accent-
why did he come away with me-
and all that i cant tell you alto-
gether but i can say that he takes in
ideas and images and impressions
with something besides his brain and
senses he had a use for me and my
science he told me things and
opened up vistas he taught me to
worship ancient primordial and un-
holy gods and mapped out a road to
a terrible goal which i cant even
hint to you dont press me james
-its for the sake of your sanity and
the worlds sanity

  	 the creature is beyond all bounds
hes in league with the stars and all
the forces of nature dont think im
still crazy james-i swear to you
im not ive had too many glimpses
to doubt he gave me new pleasures
that were forms of his palesgean wor-
ship and the greatest of those was
the black fever

 god james havent you seen
through the business by this time
do you still believe the black fever
came out of tibet and that i learned
about it there use your brains
man look at millers article here
hes found a basic antitoxin that will
end all fever within half a century
when other men learn how to modify
it for the different forms hes cut
the ground of my youth from under
me-done what id have given my
life to do-taken the wind out of all
the honest sails i ever flung to the
breeze of science do you wonder
the last test



his article gave me a turn do you
wonder it shocks me out of my mad-
ness back to the old dreams of my
youth too late too late but not
too late to save others

t guess im rambling a bit now

  - old man you know-the hypo-
dermic i asked you why you didnt
tumble to the facts about black fever
how eould you though doesnt mil-
ler say hes cured seven cases with
his serum a matter of diagnosis
james he- only thinks it is black
fever i can read between his lines
here old chap on page  is the
key to the whole thing read it
again

  you see dont you the fever
cases from the pacific coast didnt
respond to his serum they puzzled
him they didnt even seem like any
true fever he knew well those were
my cases those were the real black
fever cases and there cant ever be
an antitoxin on earth thatll cure
black fever

 how do i know because black
fever isnt of this earth its from
somewhere else james-and surama
alone knows where because he
brought it here he brought it and
i spread it thats the secret james
thats all i wanted the appointment
for-thats all i ever did-just
spread the fever that i carried in this
gold syringe and in the deadlier fin-
ger-ring-pump-sy ring e you see on my
index finger science a blind i
wanted to kill and kill and kill a
single pressure of my finger and the
black fever was inoculated i want-
ed to see living things writhe and
squirm scream and froth at the
mouth a single pressure of the
pump-syringe and i could wtatch
them as they died and i couldnt
live or think unless i had plenty to
watch thats why i jabbed every-
thing in sight with the accursed
hollow needle animals criminals
children servants-and the next
would have been-

  clarendons voice broke and he
crumpled up perceptibly in his chair

    that-that james-was-my life
surama made it so-he taught me
and kept me at it till i couldnt stop
then-then it got too much even for
him he tried to check me fancy-
he trying to check anybody in that
line but now ive got my last speci-
men this is my last test good sub-
ject james-im healthy-devilish
healthy deuced ironic though-the
madness has gone now so there
wont be any fun watching the
agony cant be-cant-

  a violent shiver of fever racked
the doctor and dalton mourned
amidst his horror-stupefaction that
he could give no grief how much of
alfreds story was sheer nnsense
and how much nightmare truth he
could not say but in any case he felt
that the man was a victim rather
than a criminal and above all he
was a boyhood comrade and geor-
ginas brother thought of the old
days came back kaleidoscopically
little alf-the yard at phillips
exeter-the quadrangle at columbia
-the fight with tom cortland when
he saved alf from a pommeling   

  he helped clarendon to the lounge
and asked gently what he could do
there was nothing alfred could
only whisper now but he asked for-
giveness for all his offenses and com-
mended his sister to the care of his
friend

 you-youll-make her happy
he gasped   she deserves it martyr
-to-a myth make it up to her
james dont - let - her - know-
more-than she has to

  his voice trailed off in a mumble
and he fell into a stupor dalton
rang the bell but margarita had gone
to bed so he called up the stairs for
georgina she was firm of step but
very pale alfreds scream had tried
her sorely but she had ti-usted james
she trusted him still as he showed
her the unconscious form on the
lounge and asked her to go back to


weird tales

lier room and rest no matter what
sounds she might hear he did not
wish her to witness the awful spec-
tacle of delirium certain to come hut
bade her kiss her brother a final fare-
well as he lay there calm and still
very like the delicate boy he had once
been so she left him-the strange
moonstruck star-reading genius she
had mothered so long-and the pic-
ture she carried away was a very
merciful one

  dalton must bear to his grave a
sterner picture his fears of delirium
were not vain and all through the
black midnight hours his giant
strength restrained the frenzied con-
tortions of the mad sufferer what
he heard from those swollen blacken-
ing lips he will never repeat he has
never been quite the same man since
and he knows that no one who hears
such things can ever be wholly as he
was before so for the worlds good
he dares not speak and he thanks
god that his laymans ignorance of
certain subjects makes many of the
revelations cryptic and meaningless
to him

toward morning clarendon sud-
denly woke to a sane consciousness
and began to speak in a firm voice

  james i didnt tell yoxi what
must be done-about everything
blot out these entries in greek and
send my notebook to dr miller all
my other notes too that youll find
in the files hes the big authority
today-his article proves it your
friend at the club was right

  but everything in the clinic must
go everything ivithout exception
dead or alive or-otherwise all the
plagues of hell are in those bottles on
the shelves bum them-bum it all
-if one thing escapes surama will
spread black death throughout the
world and above all burn surama
that-that thing-must not breathe
the wholesome air of heaven you
know now-what i told you-you
know why such an entity cant be

allowed on earth it wont be mur-
der-surama isnt human-if youre
as pious as you used to be james i
shant have to urge you remember
the old text-thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live -or something of the
sort

  burn him james dont let him
chuckle again over the torture of mor-
tal flesh i say burn kim-the neme-
sis of flame-thats all that can reach
him james unless you can catch him
asleep and drive a stake through his
heart    kill him-extirpate him-
cleanse the decent universe of its
primal taint-the taint i recalled
f rom its age-long sleep    

  the doctor had risen on his elbow
and his voice was a piercing shriek
toward the last the effort was too
much however and he lapsed very
suddenly into a deep tranquil eoma
dalton himself fearless of fever
since he knew the dread germ to be
non-contagious composed alfreds
arms and legs on the lounge and
threw a light afghan over the fragile
form after all mightnt much of
this horror be exaggeration and de-
lirium mightnt old doc macneil
pull him through on a long chance
the governor strove to keep awake
and walked briskly up and down the
room but his energies had been
taxed too deeply- for such measures
a seconds rest in the chair by the
table took matters out of his hands
and he was presently sleeping soundly
despite his best intentions

  dalton started up as a fierce light
shone in his eyes and for a moment
he thought the dawn had come but
it was not the dawn and as he rubbed
his heavy lids he saw that if was the
glare of the burning clinic in the
yard whose stout planks flamed and
roared and crackled heavenward in
the most stupendous holocaust he had
ever seen it was indeed the nem-
esis of flame that clarendon had
wished and dalton felt that some
strange combustibles must be in-
volved in a blaze so much wilder than
the last test



anything normal pine or redwood
could afford he glanced alarmedly
at the lounge but alfred was not
there starting up he went to call
georgina but met her in the hall
roused as he was by the mountain of
living fire

  	 the clinics burning down   she
cried how is al now

   hes disappeared - disappeared
while i dropped asleep  replied
dalton reaching out a steadying arm
to the form which faintness had be-
gun to sway

  gently leading her upstairs toward
her room he promised to search at
once for alfred but georgina slowly
shook her head as the flames from
outside cast a weird glow through
the window on the landing

 he must be dead james-he
could never live sane and knowing
what he did i heard him quarreling
with surama and know that awful
things were going on he is my
brother but-it is best as it is

  her voice had sunk to a whisper

  suddenly through the open win-
dow came the sound of a deep
hideous chuckle and the flames of
the burning clinic took fresh con-
tours till they half resembled some
nameless cyclopean creatures of
nightmare james and georgina
paused hesitant and peered out
breathlessly through the landing
window then from the sky came a
quick thunderous peal as a forked
bolt of lightning shot down with ter-
rible directness into the very midst
of the blazing ruin the deep chuckle
ceased and in its place came a fran-
tic ululant yelp as of a thousand
ghouls and werewolves in torment
it died away with long reverberant
echoes and slowly the flames re-
sumed their normal shape

  the watchers did not move but
waited till the pillar of fire had
shrunk to a smoldering glow they
were glad of a half-rusticity which
had kept the firemen from trooping

out and of the wall which excluded
the curious what had happened
was not for vulgar eyes-it involved
too much of the universes inner
secrets for that

 in the pale dawn james spoke
softly to georgina who could do no
more than put her head on his breast
and sob

   sweetheart i think he has atoned
he must have set the fire you know
while i was asleep he told me it
ought to be burned-the clinic and
everything in it surama too it was
the only way to save the world from
the unknown horrors he had loosed
upon it he knew and he did what
was best

 he was a great man georgie
lets never forget that we must
always be proud of him for he start-
ed out to help mankind and was
titanic even in his sins ill tell you
more sometime what he did be it
good or evil was what no man ever
did before lie was the first and last
to break through certain veils and
even apollonius of tyana takes
second place beside him but we
mustnt talk about that we must
remember him only as the little alf
we knew-as the boy who wanted to
master medicine and conquer fever  

in tiie afternoon the leisurely fire-
men overhauled the ruins and
found two skeletons with bits of
blackened flesh adhering-only two
thanks to the undisturbed lime-pits
one was of a man the other is still
a subject of debate among the biolo-
gists of the coast it was not exactly
an apes or a saurians skeleton but
it had disturbing suggestions of lines
of evolution of which paleontology
has revealed no trace the charred
skull oddly enough was very human
and reminded people of surama but
the rest of the bones were beyond
conjecture only well-cut clothing
could have made such a body look
like a man


weird tales

  but the human bones were clar-
endons no one disputed this and
the world at large still mourns the
untimely death of the greatest doctor
of his age the bacteriologist whose
universal fever serum would have far
eclipsed dr millers kindred anti-
toxin had he lived to bring it to per-
fection much of millers late suc-
cess indeed is credited to the notes
bequeathed him by the hapless vic-
tim of the flames of the old rivalry
and hatred almost none survived
and even dr wilfred jones has been
known to boast of his association
with the vanished leader

  james dalton and his wife geor-
gina have always preserved a ret-
icence which modesty and family
grief might well account for they
published certain notes as a tribute
to the great mans memory but have
never confirmed or contradicted
either the popular estimate or the
rare hints of marvels that a very few
keen thinkers have been known to
whisper it is very subtly and slow-
ly that the facts have filtered out
dalton probably gave dr macneil
an inkling of the truth and that good

soul had not many secrets from his
son

  the daltons have led on the
whole a very happy life for their 
cloud of terror lies far in the back-
ground and a strong mutual love
has kept the world fresh for them
but there are things which disturb
them oddly-little things of which
one would scarcely ever think of
complaining they can not bear per-
sons who are lean or deep-voiced be-
yond certain limits and georgina
turns pale at the sound of any gut-
tural chuckling senator dalton has
a mixed horror of occultism travel
hypodermics and strange alphabets
which most find hard to unify and
there are still those who blame him
for the vast proportion of the doc-
tors library that he destroyed with
such painstaking completeness

  macneil though seemed to re-
alize he was a simple man and he
said a prayer as the last of alfred
clarendons strange books crumbled
to ashes nor would anyone who had
peered understandingly within those
books wish a word of that prayer
unsaid

place

the story thus far

jjugo gunnar a young french noble who has
run away from home and joined a gipsy band
falls in love with ivga brenryk daughter of the
dead wladislaw brenryk of ponkert who had
been put to death as a werewolf he procures
horses to take ivga away to france as his bride
with her foster-father the crippled dmitri helgar
but ivga being the daughter of a werewolf has
long been suspected of being a witch and while
hugo is obtaining the horses for their flight she
is seized by the villagers and tied to a post on the
public gallows subjected to the abuse and tor-
ments of the populace the villagers have been
roused to this procedure by finding a woodchopper
dead in the forest frightfully mangled by wolves
and ivga as the werewolfs daughter is held to
be the cause of the woodclioppers death she is
dragged from dmitris home and hung in chains
in the public square of ponkert ready to be
burned at the stake on the morrow

now as the girl hung only
partly conscious in the
chains that bound her to the
post weak and dazed from the beat-
ing and insults she had received
heart-sick for she believed dmitri
dead and that hugo had forsaken
her she felt that all that makes life
worth living had been taken away

  so when she felt something from
outside calling gently insistently and
her spirit tugged at her body im-
patient to be free although she
feared she did not resist and pres-
ently her spirit was drawn from her
body like a sword from its sheath and

weird tales

hovered silently above its former
shell

  as her astral self hung there a
spirit invisible to the eyes of the sen-
try who paced below whistling an
eeiy tune to dispel the demons of the
night she seemed to have been lifted
into another realm in which there was
no pain nor suffering no hunger nor
thirst no sorrow nor delight but only
a restful sense of peace that per-
meated her being and she longed to
remain in that blissful state forever

  she felt that something held her
and she looked down to behold that
a wisp of cord connected this new
self with the body she had quitted
and quite naturally it came to her
that if the cord were broken she
would be free and the torturers that
were to come in the morning would
be cheated

  timidly at first then harder she
tugged at the cord which gave and
stretched but would not snap at
each tug the body in the straps
quivered and twitched and at last
moaned

  the sentry started swore at his
nerves and continued his dreary
whistling three minor notes over and
over again in monotonous succession
whether it was the continued strain
on the cord or the magic in the tune
or the dismal creak and whine of the
heavy book swinging in its rusty
chains or perhaps all three uniting
the cord began to stretch and thin to
a thread soon it would part

  then the girl felt the proximity of
another very near one who radiated
such an immense power that it surged
in waves through her spirit like an
elixir of life and obeying an un-
spoken command to turn she ceased
the strain upon the cord and faced
the stranger

  instinctively she knew feeling no
surprize that the spirit intended evil
it was neither male nor female in
principle yet seemed both like her-
self it hovered had limbs and a body

yet was not human but a spirit in
its face there was a look of sadness
yet of confidence in its own power to
overcome any obstacle a frightful
sorrow as of one who broods over
lost opportunities having made a
mistake which can not be repaired
yet knows that he is all-powerful
against any foe so that the spirits
pride was arrogant and domineering

  it was a lost soul that stared into
the girls face and she suddenly be-
came aware that as it pertained of
both man and woman yet was
neither so it was also higher than the
brute and lower than human-and
was neither still she did not feel
afraid for she had passed human
sensations and left them with the
body bound to the stone post

  in this manner did spirit of human
meet spirit of elemental and con-
verse was held upon equal ground

  while she watched the odd figure
its black lips moved and words
croaked forth

  althusar companion of the years
art thou present it asked and by
its side there took shape the figure
of a man swarthy in hue with nar-
row jet-black eyes dark hair and
kindly in aspect who smiled upon the
girl

  he was garbed in a long flowing
robe of white which was ornamented
by signs of the zodiac in gold em-
broidery and a dragon in flaming
scarlet its scales outlined in gold
that seemed with his movements to
live and writhe as it coiled about his
waist around his high forehead a
circlet of dull red metal was set hold-
ing back his hair and mounted in it
were a ruby several pearls and a
large flawless white diamond form-
ing with the circlet a symbolical ar-
rangement of the four elements-
earth fire water and air

  the girl recognized that she was
in the presence of a most potent
magic and made obeisance althusar
smiled and stretched out his hand to
her
the werewolfs daughter



  do not be afraid the words
impinged upon her consciousness
but she heard no voice she knew with
a certainty which seemed quite
natural that the thought of the man
had communicated with her own
without the need of clumsy spoken
words

  perhaps she thought this is
the language that ghosts speak   and
she answered   i am not afraid but
who are you who are called althusar
and what is this creature which has
brought me from my body into this
strange place

  that is what he has brought you
here to tell you replied the man
nodding toward the other as for
me i am a mage of the chaldees and
his companion

  but who is he insisted the
girls spirit

  on earth came the dreadful
words men call him-the master
below the girls body strained
against her bonds until the stout
leather creaked and the sentry looked
up grinning

  art anxious for the morning
little sparrow he called patience
devil-chick the night is cold but
we prepare a blanket woven of flames
for thee with the dawn so saying
the man cheerily continued his whist-
ling and strode his path about the
grim structure nor knew of the drama
fraught with doom for many yet un-
bom that was being enacted invisibly
above his head

nphe master the black demon of
my fathers story the werewolf
of ill omen the wrecker of my house
the subtle tempter of men has me
so thought the girl and the mon-
ster sadly hypocritically bowed its
head a sardonic chuckle rumbling
from its chest and the master
spoke saying ivga brenryk
daughter of the man who betrayed
my band to death thou hast been
brought to a perilous place because of

thy ancestry is it so true it is
through no fault of thine but on the
morrow thou diest as surely as the
sun will rise unless i save thee and
i am the only one who can thou
understandest good listen then
to the history of one whom earth-
lings call the master

  around the dark star near algol
which is called by men  the demon 
there spin many minor planets in its
shadow unlit by any ray of light
on them no vegetation thrives no
animals no fish no form of animate
life moves visible to the eye great
balls of jagged rock without an
atmosphere or seas they hurtle
through space to an unknown goal
yet they are peopled to the point of
overcrowding by spirits who have
never known the joys of a body
skilled in the black arts are these
elementals and constantly they exert
an undreamed-of power on human
affairs upon this and other planets
more fortunately placed than they
constantly they yearn to experience
the satisfactions of a body the feel
of light and air the sounds of things
in motion upon another planet and
scheming they plot ever to steal a
body when they may knowing that
they will never gain one else

 i was one of these from
nithrys the largest of the minor orbs
i came to earth drawn by the power
of a sorceress in ancient babylon of
which you have never heard but
which was a great city in its time
by her magic arts she knew of
algol and its dark people that round
it spin thinking to gain the power
of one of these for herself she sent
a mans spirit from his body as we
have done to you and while ho was
away i slipped within his shell and
united myself with it by ties which
can not be broken except by my will

  i came to earth meaning no harm
to any that dwelt therein longing
only for life and happiness but the
sorceress while i slept did mon-
strous things with various magics be-


weird tales

fore my rude spirit was fully shaped
to its new house

 a devil i became a demon
that she planned to rule and use for
her own purposes when she was
finished this body could never die
by sickness or by accident flame
only can kill me and so althusar
foresees that i shall die at last
althusar the soul of the body i stole
is likewise bound while i and this
body dwell together for never having
truly died his destiny can not be
completed until the body is vacant
and he can enter to pass from it in
the proper manner he lives a life
in death a spirit that haunts me
wherever i roam but we are friends
for we both have suffered my only
companion is althusar and i am his

  now we who dwell on nithrys
have magic of our own and the magic
of her who sought to rule me was not
strong enough when i knew my
strength because of her crime
against me i swore that i would bow
to nothing but master over all i saw
would i be and i have had opposi-
tion but i win the sorceress who
would have slaved me was the first
she becoming a slave herself

  from that time i have carved a
red path through history a bloody
reckoning upon the human race that
made me the thing i am for i slay
with a single purpose and it is well
for him who dies instead of choosing
the life i offer life with the master
is not good for slaves

  tribes cities nations have fought
together puny miserable wars to ease
petty spites i the unconquerable
declared war upon a world alone
i stand against the human race a
victor but in one thing have i
failed the future is not clear to me
a little way i can pierce the shadows
blit not far so from althusar my
comrade in misfortune skilled in the
white magic and the lore of the stars
i learn the paths i follow

  so althusar read what the
future has for me and the seed of

brenryk down the years speak
babylonian  

  then spoke the white-robed man
and his words were stem yet tem-
pered with a note of pity and he
said

  so again must i see for thee i
look into the future oh vagrant
wanderer and i see sorrow and
great tribulation for all that come
near thee

  i see europe running red with
blood and thou shalt be the cause

  i see the smoke of the torturers
fires rising high and i smell the
stench of smoldering bodies brought
to this pass by thee

  i see misfortune for all who bear
the name of gunnar and death for
most  

 the master smiled grimly go
on he said

  althusar hesitated must i he
asked   thou wilt be happier
ignorant  

  go on repeated the master i
would know all or nothing make
an end

  i see thee wanderer passing
like a flame through every land on
earth but one and following close
strides death but one pace behind in
your wake men dropping before his
scythe like wheat before the sickle

 europe shall be overrun by
vampires werewolves witches and
warlocks of thy making and the
powers of darkness shall triumph
over the world-for a time

  is this your evil tidings baby-
lonian sad indeed the master
chuckled so shall i be avenged
upon this crawling vermin that in-
fest the earth so do i take a bloody
reckoning for my wrongs knowing
no mercy and then

  then a stern note crept into
the voice of althusar then scourge
of mankind thy doom follows fast

  from a land across the seas a
land yet undiscovered one shall
come that will meet your magic with
stronger magic and as you strive
the werewolfs daughter



again to bend others to your will you
shall be dashed to earth and smashed
by those you have destroyed but
the manner of your overthrow is
hidden from me by a veil which i
can not pierce and i can give you no
warning  

  i do not understand you calm-
ly said the master is that all
not quite althusar answered
not quite i see dimly through a
mist of fire a cloud of sparks whirl-
ing high in which you lie dying but
not in pain i see myself slip into
my body which you stole and also
die together then i see ourselves
traveling side by side toward a place
of rest where our labors shall be done
and this curse of life in death shall
be lifted from us and peace forever
and oblivion shall be ours

  this oh wanderer is all that i
can see the rest is hidden from
even these far-piercing eyes of mine
but this i know the end draws near
for upon an unknown sea three ships
are sailing sailing into the west
and from the hidden country that
they will find your conqueror comes
i have done say your say

the master pondered long before
replying then with an air of hav-
ing made an irrevocable decision he
spoke saying

 the master am i master of
men of beasts of elementals
master of all living things that i
choose to hold yet to you reader of
the stars and the future i confess
that i am not master of myself i am
earthbound and i go forward blind-
ly driven to my destiny by forces of
which i know nothing

  you and i comrade are both vic-
tims of the sorceress yet is the great-
er sorrow mine for i have not willed
that i should be dreaded on earth
hated and feared and dragging others
to destruction with me but my ambi-
tion was to dwell within a body and
be like men

  i have gone too far i can not
turn back now or ever i go forward
ever forward to complete my destiny
and though what you have read for
me may be true i do not repine for
come what may i have lived

  but be thou ready comrade to
enter this bodily shell when i its
present tenant shall be dispossessed
and because of our common sorrow
and our friendship i will spare this
girl for two reasons her life has
been one long wo because of me and
it shall be pleasant from today and
i perceive that through her i can
gain others in ever increasing num-
bers as time rolls on and though by
so doing i destroy myself i wul
rule

  then to the girls astral self the
master addressed himself and his
words were wondrous gentle

  your life i have seen and your
trouble and the hate of these scoun-
drels here for you long i have
brooded near this village scheming
plotting planning how i might be
avenged upon your father he be-
trayed me in life though i admit his
cause was great for i have been a
cruel master ever to my slaves and
he cheated me even in death dying in
a manner that forbade my interfer-
ence for a time i meant to wreak
my vengeance upon you the last of
his line trusting that he might see
and be punished but you have
suffered aye all your life you have
suffered for your fathers sin and it
is in my mind to show you mercy
my revenge i must have and i will
but i can wait

  the years are nothing to those
who are immortal i give you choice
be my slave and i will free you and
the score is evened also the people
of ponkert shall suffer most greatly
from us for that which they have
done this day

  and the other choice refuse my
offer still i free you your lover
shall be yours and all your lifetime


weird tales

you shall go uiharmed by me but
at your death should you leave heirs
then shall they be my prey one
from each generation and perhaps
more shall i take until your line is
stamped from the earth and is
exterminated this i promise and
will fulfil say girl if from your
offspring if such there be i may have
one to do my will choose it is
yourself or the unknown the un-
born

  you may said the girl aloud
in the flat dull tone of a sleeper

 it is well he chuckled and
then in a persuasive manner he
sprang his trap

  of each generation was all that
he said but the three words spelled
sorrow misery and terror to count-
less souls yet unborn for she had the
power by a word to decide the future
of many as they were yet uncreate
and upon her decision their very
existence depended this bing true
she had likewise the power to use
them these unborn descendants as
she would

  yes she said in her bodily
voice and by the word she slew hun-
dreds of unbom souls as surely as
though she had laid a knife to their
throats by that word a chain of
helpless victims was established even
to the present day each victim drag-
ging others with him like link after
link of an anchor chain plunging into
the sea one pulling the next till many
are beneath

  a look of devilish joy swept across
the masters distorted face and an
accompanying look of sorrow lay
upon the countenance of the baby-
lonian as he vanished

  it is well said the master
your body will forget these words
now but later you will remember
again one is coming even now to
free you

  and with the words he also disap-
peared forever from her sight

  	how two men came to ponkert

it was a nervous bird that hopped
into the cottage by the wood and
cocking its head upon one side as it
looked at the motionless figure upon
the floor it listened fearfully and
perhaps reasoned as follows

  he did not move apparently he
is dead but then one can never tell
these humans are so cunning it may
be a trap truly these were hard times
when a self-respecting bird must
enter the very den of the ogre for
food but what would you one
must live  

  so he sidled closer and admin-
istered a sharp experimental peck on
the mans neck

  he was a large but timid bird so
that when a groan issued from the
prostrate form he squawked raucous-
ly and pelted out of the cottage in a
scurrying whir of wings coming to
rest in a near-by tree and talked to
himself at some length concerning
his bravery while he watched for
further developments

  these were not long in eoming
the man moved his fingers slightly
as though they clenched on some-
thing and groaned again after
which he began to mumble broken
words face in the dust

  oh god he muttered if there
is a god help me now give me
back my strength just for a little
while she is a pretty little girl -and
she always loved you she is so dear
and sweet and lovable are you
going to let her die

  his voice sank to a confidential
murmur you see god ive got to
go i cant stay here while they hurt
her i promised i would always
guard and keep her must i break
my given word its a wicked cruel
joke to play this trick with me i
know ive been wicked in many ways
and i deserve no pity but dont you
see god it isnt for me i ask you
arent punishing me but my little
girl and what did she ever do i
the werewolfs daughter



dont care what becomes of me take
my soul and thrust me into the deep-
est pit of hell but save her oh
god give me back my strength
give-give- 

  the feeble voice droned away to
silence dmitri helgar mercenary
czech captain in the black brigade
had finished his first prayer

  the room was darker before there
was further movement the after-
glow of sunset was fading and an
early star shone when dmitri spoke
again

  strength and a sword he ex-
claimed in a strong voice far differ-
ent from the former tone although
he had not stirred a sword and
an arm to wield it he said in the
tones of one who sleeps yet speaks
and his right arm began to raise
itself upon the fingertips like a
monstrous insect blindly sprawling
and like an insect the hand crawled
toward the well-beloved sword hilt

  the fingers missed by inches but
continued to walk as far as the arms
length would permit then staggered
along crabwise the thumb creeping
ahead digging into the floor and con-
tracting thus pulling the hand be-
hind it and at last touched the cool
sword a great explosive ah
burst from the pale lips blowing the
dust away as the fingers closed about
the hilt

  the touch was like the caress of a
lover from the grip on gate-open-
er came power and returning vigor
and now as he lay there his wan
cheeks flushed with new health more
even whether it was from the
prayer or from his desperate desire to
go to ivgas rescue a strange feeling
pulsed through his limbs in legs
that had been numb and lifeless for
a year a prickling sensation came
and went and came again and
when it passed he found that his
feet would move

  then while he marveled rapt with
the wonder of the seeming miracle
he heard voices outside the cottage

  two men came laughing down the
road talking loudly as they neared
the building then suddenly becoming
quiet careful footsteps came up to
the door and paused a deep hatred
came to dmitri as he lay rigid
listening

  he has not moved he is dead
whispered one you killed him with
that last kick wesoskas

  the other laughed evilly a good
deed then i owed it to him no
man strikes me but he pays-some-
time he struck me once did i ever
tell you

  i believe you did now that you
speak of it said the smith sar-
donically come the night falls
if any soldier should hear of this

and see us here-

  the idiot giggled soon soon

i want to talk to him a bit  

  leaning farther through the door-
way he cried hey in there listen
to this she is in town fastened to
the stake wouldnt you like to see
your imp now

  she wont kill any more men or
blind them for looking at her we
have her fast and at dawn she bums

  the wood is gathered the pile is
ready and the pitch is at hand
ha-ha-ha old man old man can
you hear me in ilell old man hey
why dont you answer me

  the smith seized him horrified at -
this tormenting of a dead man
come you fool come away he
urged i hear sounds in the wood
all right chuckled the tanner
ive got to leave you old man re-
member  at dawn she dies im
sorry now i killed you really i
am if you could only see it

  and then his voice was lifted in
expostulations against the force his
companion was using in dragging
him away

  as the complaints became fainter
and could no longer be heard a
tenebrous shadow moved with no
body to cause it and squatted a
puddle of blackness in a comer


weird tales

  and in the deserted cottage a thing
happened which would have chilled
the blood of the idiot tanner

  the form he had thought a corpse
raised itself upon its knees and for
the first time in a year stood erect
upon its feet

  for a moment dmitri stood listen-
ing by the door then crossed to the
wall with steps that were uncertain
and wavered he lifted down the
leather harness that would fasten the
broadsword to his back and buckled
the straps together when he re-
turned to the door and placed gate-
opener in its sheath he did so with a
surer stride though the sword was
heavy he fitted the harness about his
shoulders and stood straight in the
doorway looking out over the trees
at the stars which gleamed also over
ponkert a mile away

  reverently he bowed his head be-
lieving his prayer had been an-
swered every moment now he felt
stronger although his legs were still
weak and trembled beneath gate-
openers weight

  dmitri had never been a religious
man indeed one of his frequent
sayings was if there is a god at
all he must pay more attention to
those who are not always bothering
him by asking for something how
weary he must be of begging but
now it seemed that even the strong
were sometimes weak and with a
full heart he would have worshiped
and given thanks but could find no
words and all the while precious time
was fleeting by never to return

  he raised his hands beseechingly
to the stars and cried i am coming
ivga if you are alive i will free
you or die in ponkert square if they
have killed you look down from the
parapets of heaven and watch the
wizened souls of ponkert dead go
squealing by to satans halls and
brenryk watch a ilelgar keep a
promise  

  he descended the steps and walked

slowly into the forest toward the
village

  behind him a black pool of shad-
ow darker than the rest of the night
shades flowed down the steps and
along the path it was oddly shaped
as though something stunted and de-
formed lingered there suiting its pace
to that of the old man just ahead
yet there was no one else that could
be seen walking down the path

at this time which was about the
second hour of the night a small
procession stopped just outside pon-
kert

  a hiss had sounded from a thicket
and hugo drew rein and half rose in
his saddle who is there he said
step in front of me

 it is you hugo a cautious
whisper came i am glad i have
waited hours for you to come

  from the bushes hobbled a hunched
figure wrapped about in a long black
cloak and he recognized the wrinkled
face as that of the gipsy crone
clauda his best friend after mirko

  what is it he said startled by
her strange look what has hap-
pened   

  dont go through the village
hugo she replied clutching the
bridle the people will kill you
they have seen you with the were-
wolfs daughter and they will bum
you too

  burn me too his heart almost
stopped beating have they burned
herf

  not yet was the grim reply
but in the morning

 quick mother clauda what
have they done where is she

  in the square bound to the stake
on the scaffold hugo what are you
going to do

 the last words were almost a
scream for the boy had leapt from
his horse and tom away her cloak

  i am going to save her he re-
plied and wrapped the cloak about
him drawing it close about his head
the werewolfs daughter



  they will kill you hugo is she
worth it quavered old clauda her
lips trembling

 he turned to her tenderly and
placed his arm about her waist

  clauda you have been a mother
to me and we love each other do we
not but now my heart lies in pon-
kert and if this girl dies my life is
an empty thing for she is my wor-
ship and we have sworn an oath to-
gether take the horses to the camp
and if i never return they shall be
yours for i have plenty of money
with me give mirko a farewell and
this for thee

  he bent and kissed the soft with-
ered lips they were wet with tears
then gently he disengaged the arms
that clung to keep him with her and
he was away running with long
strides into the village streets mak-
ing a wide circle to avoid the first
row of buildings

  clauda sobbing led the horses
around the village with an uncanny
prescience she knew she would never
see the boy again and the days ahead
would be bleak and drear without
him

  and thus it came about that on the
third night of the caravans stay
from opposite sides of ponkert came
two men animated with a single pur-
pose pawns in a game that neither
could have understood-a game whose
beginning was before their known
history and whose end and far-
reaching effects may not yet be done

	rapier versus saber

tvga cried out and opened her eyes
a to a blinding glare a sputtering
torch scorched her face and hair as
the guard bent over her and shook her
shoulder roughly

  what are you talking about he
snarled   none of your tricks vixen
art calling up some fiend from hell
to serve thee witch silence or ill
slit your tongue why dont you
answer me answer me to whom

were you talking why did you say
you may and again yes when
no one spoke to you why rat sis-
ter

  with the entering of her body
again ivga had forgotten the meet-
ing with the master and now she
could only blink into the glare and
murmur someone is coming at
last hardly knowing the meaning
of the words for the master had
taken back the memory of the meet-
ing as one last mercy

  still holding her by the shoulder
the guard turned about his face
white with fear for he was prone to
superstition and expected to see
some bat-winged thing close by called
from its evil nest by the witch

  a man was standing below at the
foot of the steps

  his face was not visible for a fold
of his long black cloak hid all but
his eyes which glinted like steel in
the brilliant moonlight

  the revulsion of feeling was too
much for the sentry who are you
and what do you want he queried
boldly a sepulchral voice issued
from the black cloak

  i am a messenger from hell for
you dog brother it said your
place is prepared come

  with slow tread the figure mounted
the steps and the sentry backed away
as it came higher

  stop he squeaked in a terrified
falsetto what do you want

  the black cloak fell to the ground
as the man sprang up the last two
steps and the girl gasped hugo
as he flashed her a quick cheery
smile and advanced toward her
guard

    i want the girl and your blood  
he spat death to you gutter
offal and the guard seeing that
it was only a man before him sprang
forward roaring

  hugo grinned as a wolf grins
then as the guards sword hissed from
its scabbard the primitive rapier
glimmered in the boys hand like a


weird tales

slender pencil of light and the two
blades engaged

  back across the platform the sentry
rushed the weaker man in the first
shock of conflict his longer weapon
whirling wickedly and striking sparks
as it clashed against the slim pointed
rod that seemed to be always in the
way

  parrying his fiercest strokes the
rapier slanted from side to side never
thrusting or remaining still but
always retreating before the guards
ferocious slashes yet the saber bit
nothing but air being deftly turned
aside in midstroke before it had
reached maximum velocity and it
ever whistled off at a tangent

  they reached the platforms edge
and hugo watching his opponents
eyes read in them a sudden evil glee
and suspecting something uncertain
therefore to be dreaded he danced
abruptly to the left as he did so
his groping foot found empty space
in place of solid plank and he shot
out from the scaffold falling eight
feet and landing quite solidly upon
the cobblestone pavement of the
square

  almost instantly he was up again
but no longer smiling and one who
watched would have noticed that his
movements lacked the resilience and
spring of a moment before three
slashes he parried mechanically
dazed by the blow then as his brain
cleared he took the offensive enough
time had been wasted

  through tight-clenched teeth his
breatli hissed like the angry speech
of a snake and now menacing the
rapier point pressed forward and
did not give ground

  all of the guards experience up to
that time had been with cutting weap-
ons-sabers axes broadswords large
and ugly tools for hacking designed
to kill or maim with a single blow
thrusting weapons were likewise
clumsy spears and pikes in a dozen
cruel forms and variations these
were the weapons of the time small

wonder that ivga had laughed at
hugos rapier so small in compari-
son 

  but the guard hard-pressed and
fighting for his life against a strange
weapon and an unknown method of
fighting would have felt no inclina-
tion to jeer could he have spared the
time a blur was before his eyes and
from his cheek a warm salty triclde
ran into his gasping mouth where
hugos point had torn in a barely
deflected drive for the throat

  moonlight is good to die in
laughed the boy are you ready
woman-beater  

  this was the first blood drawn dur-
ing the fight and had the instant
effect of setting the guard wild and
reckless so that he rushed into the
almost invisible circle of steel

  in fifteen seconds with three
cleverly executed strokes one side-
step and a parry hugo pinked his
antagonist neatly through the fleshy
portion of his left shoulder and thus
turning the man a quarter round he
slipped the rapier point into his
enemys right wrist as his arm was
raised for a blow

  with the double power of the up-
ward thrust and the downward blow
the rapier tore through arm and
sleeve as it might through paper
leaving the arm useless

  from the guards nerveless fingers
fell the curved sword slitting the
side of hugos boot as it clanked
upon the stones this was his only
injury in all that strange fight
quickly reaching with his left hand
the man clutched for the fallen
sword but contrary to the usual pro-
cedure for the victor in such cases
at least in fiction hugo did not
nobly but foolishly step aside and
allow him to pick it up instead
being a human being fighting for his
own life and all that he held precious
he did the natural thing under the
circumstances

  as the guard lurched forward the
rapier point met him he was eon-
the werewolfs daughter



seious of a fierce burning pain over
his heart a chill numb feeling in his
lung and that was all for an
instant hugo kept the pose left hand
half behind him right knee bent
right arm and rapier forming a
straight line that ended in the guards
chest then as the man swayed for-
ward hugo saw that his back was
growing a hump and through his
coat the needle-point pricked between
the shoulder-blades

  as a tree falls so fell the guard
dragging the rapier from hugos
hand leaving the boy staring down
at him

  dead although he had been many
so this was his first victory that had
ended in death and suddenly he fell
sick in the pit of his stomach it
was so easy to kill a man 

  on the scaffold ivga spoke weakly
and conquering his squeamishness
hugo tugged at his blade the flesh
clung about it as though loth to let
it go and before it was free he was
forced to set his foot on the chest of
the corpse and pull with all his
strength

  with a swift stroke he wiped clean
the rapier upon the dead mans coat
and holding the slender rod in one
hand drew his dagger with the other
and leapt up the steps of the scaffold

  his keen knife made short work of
the leather thongs that bound her body
to the pillar and with the guards keys
he released her from the chains she
opened her eyes and smiled at him
a pale wan smile that wrung his
heart as he slashed at her cruel bonds

 i knew you would come she
whispered and her arms went out
to him

  as she took a step forward her
limbs being paralyzed by the tight-
ness of the straps gave way beneath
her and she fell to her knees upon the
rough planks instantly he was hold-
ing her close and her voice sobbed
thickly to him muffled for her face
was pressed hard against his cheek

 oh hugo i can not walk

what are we to do

  in that moment feeling her de-
pendence upon him and her implicit
trust that somehow he would save her
the boy became a man a deep love
and yearning to protect welled up
within him called by her helpless-
ness and he replied

  we will go at once to the camp
mirko will hide us come and
he stood up

the girl attempted to rise but the
pain was too great and she col-
lapsed again her wrists were deep-
ly cut by the chains and as she chafed
her ankles she could feel no sensation
in her hands

  you go she said finally leave
me here i shall only be a burden
to you the watchman will come
through here soon and we can not
both escape flee hugo before the
alarm else we both die and i dont
want you to die too

  he grinned you rave did you
really believe i would go away from
you now no if we are killed we
die together let us go to mirko  
he sheathed his weapons lifted
her in his arms and descended the
steps

  get the book on the beam hugo
said ivga it is mine

  and with the book in her arms
hugo carried her proudly across the
deserted square eery in the white
moouglare and peopled now only by
the few stray dogs that skulked in
the shadows-lean curs that kept an
odd silence and followed close behind
a couple already investigating the
dead man

  they entered a narrow street and
left the square some distance behind
before either spoke

  ivga lay quiet hi his arms watch-
ing his stern face for some signs of
weakness but though his lips were
tightly compressed his breath came
even and unhurried as he swung

along covering ground rapidly and
with long strides

  his answer was to crush her tight-
er against his chest

  you are not heavy at all little
sweetheart i could carry you for-
ever

  she clasped her arms around his
neck relieving him of a little of the
strain the book in her lap and kissed
him with a swift movement then her
brown hair sank down upon his
shoulder and the tired eyes closed

  tenderly he bore her for her cuts
and bruises were many and he
thought perhaps she slept they
entered an alley which opened off the
side street giving a view of dark
tree-tops against the stars his aim
was to reach the gipsy encampment
if possible and to place himself and
the girl under the protection of the
chief feeling certain that the cow-
ardly villagers would not dare to at-
tack a strong force

  finally he was compelled to release
his dear burden and rest while he
rubbed his cramped arms he saw
from the tail of his eye a stealthy
movement behind the comer of a
building as though someone had
peered out and darted back

  sword in hand he ran back but
nothing was in sight and he returned
to the girl again he gathered her
carefully into his arms and strode off
often turning now to look behind
but he saw no stir or movement

  this had continued for perhaps
five minutes and his suspicions were
almost lulled when ivgas head lifted
from his shoulder and her curls
brushed his cheek

  someone is following us she
whispered her lips tickling his ear

  i know he answered and quick-
ened his pace

  a large building was before them
once around the comer he laid her
down again freed his sword and

waited teeth bared in his character-
istic battle-grin

  a head poked cautiously around
the corner saw the ready blade jaw
dropping in horror and surprize and
was instantly withdrawn it was the
watchman

  hugo leapt in pursuit of the flee-
ing man who yelled with every
bound imagining the point was
already in his back the watchmans
lantern clanked on the stones and
bounded rattling along hurled
despairingly at the pursuer

 the race was short the boy
rapidly overtook the runner there
was a brief flash of steel rapier
against dagger and the cries stopped
-but the mischief had been done

  windows began to creak open and
voices to shout from house to house
as he ran hugging the shadows next
the walls back to ivga

 quick he panted to the
gipsies they will help us and
he stooped to pick her up

  no she exclaimed it is too
far they would catch us long before
we could get there we will go to the
river find a boat and drift down-
stream until we are far away

 but we will have to go back
through the village to reach the
boats he protested

  come she tugged impatiently
at him dont argue i know a
way if we climb that mountain and
go down the other side the river is
just below us dmitri-she choked
on the word-and i had a little
boat that we hid in the rocks we used
to sail on the river and fish from it

 can we go around the moun-
tain he gasped doubting her
strength for such a climb

   no  she replied jerkily   thick
brush one side river too deep on
the other cant swim i can climb
hurry

   the terrific battle at the base of the mountain
the spectacular death of dmitri and the fate of
the fugitives will be narrated in the thrilling
chapters that conclude this story in next months

ay what was that bill t   ex-
claimed the taller and thinner
of the two men staring at the
thick bush that for some way lined
each side of the dusty lane

 hanged if i know joe-thun-
derbolt maybe replied his compan-
ion eyeing blankly the dense scrub

  thunderbolt but there aint no
clouds objected joe turning his
gaze to the evening sky least
nothing to speak of he amended
his assertion as he solemnly surveyed
a few dwindling remnants of what
an hour ago had been a mass of gray
vapor that all day had veiled the
glare and tempered the scorching
rays of a july sun

  though there had been a promise
of rain in the low-lying shroud yet

toward evening it had thinned and
rapidly dispersed so that shortly
only a few wisps flushed with the
setting sun were left most certain-
ly the mighty thor stored no shaft
of his in such flimsy housing yet
something-they had no idea what-
from out the nowhere had suddenly
plunged through the bush with a
frightful crash close beside them
apparently not a dozen paces from
the lane it had entered the fringing
wood with terrific force and its short
transit from the topmost boughs to
the ground was but a rending smash
of splintered wood punctuated by the
dull impact that wound up its vol-
canic career

wer if it aint a thunderbolt
what is it queried bill it come

he expected to see some gigantic offensive that
would disarm them both

from way up anyway whatever it
is he added with conviction

  how about a flying-machine
then observed his friend hopefully

  this wasnt all that size count-
ered bill still slightly nettled by the
summary rejection of his thunder-
bolt but say it might be a guy-
a birdman-dropped out of his ma-
chine gee maybe come down miles
and miles gosh and he ceased as
the profundity of that presumed de-
scent gripped him

 flying-men dont fall out-
theyre strapped in aint they said
joe diffidently his temperamental
skepticism more than a little shaken
by the nerve-racking phenomenon
but-lord if it is a guy come
down hell be a sight he added in
an awestruck mutter

  the two men stared at each other
in sudden fear they realized that
the terrible final thud had been siek-
eningly suggestive of something limp
inert and compressible imagination
completed the picture and specula-
tion abruptly ceased

  say biil said the tall man
hoarsely we got to go in there
he nodded toward the fringing bush

  yep i guess so i aint stuck on
it though replied bill with a catch
in his voice come on he added
with querulous impatience

  now that the matter had assumed
such a significant aspect their course
distasteful though it might be was
quite clear and it augurs well for
the future of our race that two very
ordinary individuals such as these
whose lives from boyhood had been
devoted to a pursuit of the slippery
dollar rolling between the purchase
and disposal of second-hand furni-
ture and personal effects should so
instantly and simply obey the dic-
tates of our common humanity nat-
urally their vocation carried them far
afield and to this fact-and a lately
deceased farmer-they owed their in-
troduction to the little fishing-village
of lytham maine and the after-

supper stroll that had been inter-
rupted so rudely

  at once the two men entered the
scrub and for a little they cast about
like a couple of sedate retrievers in
search of their objective then they
came upon it resting in a little open
space tunneled by the shattering of
stems and the stripping of limbs from
a stouter and taller growth that
chanced here to rear a spearlike crest
as though to mark the horror at its
base

 my god joe whats this
reckon hes dead-dont you ex-
claimed bill in an awed whisper

  yep its awful i aint going no
closer said joe hastily then paused
and admitted reluctantly   though

i	guess we should make certain  

assuredly death had come in no
gracious mood to the poor bro-
ken thing they gazed upon for the
mans body was smashed and twisted
most horribly and lay in a huddled
heap amid the splintered boughs of
the tall tree and the crushed shrub-
bery limbs were hinged strangely
and repulsively at places where joints
are normally absent and the face was
merely a mass of shapeless pulp
through which the jagged end of a
shattered bough projected apart
from total disintegration it was hard
to conceive of a human frame more
completely devastated it was only
too visibly obvious that every bone
in the dead mans body was broken
and the flesh either gashed or
stripped or perforated in a score of
places

  for a moment the two men stood
staring in awed and commiserating
silence at the terrible thing and no
further word was uttered concerning
a closer investigation then the
taller man shivered a little and said
harshly say wed better beat it
back and tell the folks in the vil-
lage

  and at once stepping softly as
though they would conceal their
the plying death



presence from something feared they
turned and made their way back to
the dusty road

  say bill this poor guy now
said joe as they hastened on their
mission there aint no doubt but he
dropped out of a flying-machine so
high up we never heard it but its
queer-hes dressed all wrong it
aint the front of a birdman-or even
a passenger-no coat no mitts or
helmet not even goggles and him all
that way up 

  thats so said his companion
slowly and aint these flyers
strapped in their seats case of acci-
dents

  sure confirmed joe with the
easy assurance that anothers igno-
rance often begets though maybe
this guys straps went back on him
or-by jiminy-now i wonder  

  wonder what queried his com-
panion briefly the unwonted pace
having told on him

  well-i dunno but maybe this
guy done it himself-jumped out
went bugs or something replied
joe hesitatingly

  meanin suicide i never heard
of a birdman taken that way-they
being sure to smash some day said
bill voicing the pessimistic popular
conception of the fate awaiting such
intrepid adventurers

    but lord what a nerve if he
done it-miles and miles of dropping
through nothing mused joe loth
to relinquish the horrific pictured
descent

  what would he strip his work-
ing-rags for anyway  there aint no
sense to it objected his companion
with an innate love of debate

    i dunno-its a mystery   avowed
joe frankly

  and that was the verdict accorded
the occurrcnce by a coroners jury
and the expert investigators who at
onoe were engaged to elucidate the
strange and tragic enigma for im-
mediately the poor shattered thing
had been identified as one james

symington a youth in his early
twenties and son of a wealthy shoe
manufacturer-a young man of ex-
emplary habit and pleasing person-
ality quiet unassuming and devot-
ed to his parents his business and
the hobby of photography in short
a level-headed estimable young
american and certainly the last one
his friends would coiisider to be afflict-
ed with the insanity of self-destruction
-though a most cursory survey of
the known facts banished effectually
the incipient rumor that possibly the
discoverers had thoughtlessly orig-
inated

  it appeared that the boy had never
ascended a foot save by the aid of his
legs or an elevator and had a natural
antipathy to aeronautics moreover
on the morning of the tragedy he had
left his home for a few days vaca-
tion and had taken his car and
camera out for a ramble along the
picturesque maine coastline with no
particular objective in view but
merely to wander as fancy dictated
and the car was found ten miles
from the fatal spot overturned in a
ditch bordering a lonely stretch of
by-road that there for a space close-
ly parallels the cliffs which for many
miles tower a hundred feet or more
above the surf-lashed sands

  by what possible means had the
victim been transferred from his car
conveyed ten miles ascended to an
unguessable height and there been
launched in that terrible descent it
was all inconceivable both in the
mode of its execution and in its ob-
ject one might as well endeavor to
formulate a plausible explanation of
the sudden materialization of a pre-
historic monster in the trim flower-
beds of a city park and each de-
tail as it was brought to light but
further meshed the affair in a net of
mystery

  the little clock in the overturned
car had stopped at  p m and this
might reasonably be taken to indi-
cate the moment of capsizing and

james symingtons translation but
what had at that moment happened
if for some incomprehensible motive
the youth had been taken captive
and transferred to a flying-machine
where had it alighted and how
arisen not a sign of such a hap-
pening was visible amid the fields
of tall grass ripe for mowing that
lay on the landward side while to
the seaward lay a narrow strip of
broken boulder-strewn waste bound-
ed by a sheer hundred-foot drop the
road itself was much too narrow to
accommodate the smallest plane man
has ever flown in yet by what
other means had been effected that
rapid migration for less than half
an hour later his body had ended its
terrible flight-the taller of the two
discoverers with an eye to future
questioning had glanced at his
watch as he emerged from the shrub-
bery

  two planes had indeed some hours
earlier passed over the neighborhood
and been noted by several persons
but both had flown high over the wa-
ter and quickly vanished into the
cloud-weighted horizon and on in-
quiry they proved to be a couple of
military busses used by instruc-
tors and their pupils so there lay
not a single shred of tangible evi-
dence to connect the tragedy with
the only possible means of its con-
summation with an assailant of any
nature whatsoever

  the wrecked car was itself inex-
plicable the road affording no rea-
sonable excuse for an accident or
any evidence of its nature the
youths camera was discovered
about fifty feet distant immersed in
the scummy seepage that lay in fes-
tering pools over the ditch bottom
and though the tracks were barely
decipherable because of a stiff breeze
that had stirred the fine dust and
almost smoothed the indentations
yet there was sufficient evidence to
hazard the presumption that the car
had been stopped and the owner had

alighted and wandered slowly ahead
and stood a little while probably
taking pictures of the lonely scenery
then more uncertainly he had re-
turned rapidly and midway had
broken into a run ten feet from the
car his hat was discovered in the
ditch also there the steps had
ceased at least no trace of them re-
mained

  from all evidence of the wrecked
engine the car had been standing
motionless at the moment of its cap-
sizal and no trace of deep-gashed
ruts of swerving wheels was visible
it had simply capsized as though a
huge lever had been applied to its
side and heaved it over

  there all logical deductions and
reasonable surmises ceased other
tracks were obviously more recent
and probably left by the wondering
farm-hands who early the next morn-
ing had passed that way all that
was certain was a car overturned
and an owner who had vanished as
though snatched aloft by the fabled
jinn

  but the medical profession had
further and equally astounding testi-
mony to offer the inquest revealed
the startling fact that almost cer-
tainly the poor boy had died before
that frightful landing and been done
to death in a most abominable man-
ner the doctors stated that by some
strange means every drop of blood
had been extracted from the veins
and what they examined was but an
arid shell as devoid of moisture as a
dry sponge no known wound would
account for such complete extrava-
sation for normally there always
remained a residue imprisoned in a
network of the lesser conduits by the
rapid caving in of the main chan-
nels but this shattered thing was
absolutely devoid of the least drop of
its lifes fluid

  then more abstrusely the medical
evidence spoke of some small areas
of skin and tissue still intact about
the throat face and hands areas
the flying death



that exhibited a most peculiar condi-
tion being pitted with innumerable
minute excrescences which under
microscopical examination were
found to be of craterlike construc-
tion whose vents were in reality but
pores greatly distended and rup-
tured so badly beneath the surface
that in their bursting they had lacer-
ated the mesh of tiny veins about
them so completely that to the naked
ey-e the tissues appeared merely as a
puffed disorganized mass of macer-
ated pulp whether this condition
was the result of immense pressures
experienced in such a stupendous fall
was a matter they lacked the data
to affirm or deny but save for this
purely speculative supposition they
had no other solution to offer-a pro-
nouncement quite in accord with the
cherished traditions of scientific re-
serve and caution

  as usual public imagination
seized on the sensational and prompt-
ly garbled misquoted and maltreat-
ed the hesitant speculation and
spoke knowingly of strains and
stresses and vascular tissue and felt
exalted by their perspicacity and
justified in spoiling reams of good
paper informing weary editors of
absurd and weird conclusions the
writers had evolved to account for
an impossible objectless translation
to an invisible untraceable flying-
machine

  and there the matter rested
money and brains had collaborated
and utterly failed to unearth a single
fact upon which to base any rational
theory of mode or motive of the kill-
ing of james symington who being
but one man among many millions
each with his bread to earn and his
niche to fill in a busy world it is not
surprizing that the millions shortly
shelved the tragedy in the dim sub-
conscious vaults where side by side
lie every shred of emotion every
fact everything felt seen or heard
in a lifetime be it junk or treasure

a month later the body of one har-
riet conroy was discovered face
down on the lonely sands of ladner
bay barely three miles distant from
the spot where poor symingtons car
had capsized

  again the public thrilled with hor-
ror as it learned the strange and grue-
some facts connected with the grim
tragedy and with the odd illogical
intuition of the mass mind in mo-
ments of high emotion immediately
the two fatalities were associated
though save in one particular there
lay no resemblance between the man-
ner of the victims slaying

  harriet conroy only daughter of a
retired sea captain a widower with a
modest competence was school mis-
tress in her home villageof shaldon
just turned twenty healthy cheerful
and level-headed she was liked and
respected by all in the little commu-
nity the fact of that solitary stroll to
ladner sands was due to no morbid
love of lonely self-commune but mere-
ly the result of a persistent headache
for on that tragic day after tea with
her father she had remarked that
probably a brisk walk along the cliffs
to the sands would be better than any
medicine and mentioning that on her
return she would likely spend a few
minutes at a neighbors with a smile
of affectionate reassurance to her par-
ent she had gone on her way

  that was the last time her father
ever watched the trim figure unlatch
the little garden gate at dusk she
had not returned nor an hour later
when mindful of her words the lone-
ly old man had smiled and grumbled
fondly these women and their
minutes-it seems but yesterday she
was snug in bed and hours sleeping
by this time then thinking a little
sadly that a day might come when
another home would claim her he
slipped from revery to slumber and
awoke to find the clock hands were
nearly laid together and the house as
lonely as ever then with a sudden


weird tales

  black fear clutching at his heart the
lost fire of his seafaiing youth re-
turned to him and hatless he ran into
the darkness and pounded fiercely at
the doors of sleeping neighbors

  shortly two friends and the dis-
tracted man set off with lanterns the
way she had taken-and found her
face downward cold and dead in the
soft dry sand above high water with
dreading touch they sought for evi-
dence of foul murder but failed to
discover wound or mark of evil clutch
upon her then by the yellow light
of a lantern they searched the vicinity
for trace of assailant for it was evi-
dent there had been a struggle or
rather a defense against something
that had overtaken her

  the crooked rigid fingers the out-
thrust arms and the deep depression
in which the victim lay spoke elo-
quently and horribly of the short des-
perate struggle she had waged to pro-
tect herself against a merciless an-
tagonist who had leaped and hurled
her headlong while the frenzied old
man bent over his darling moaning
and calling piteously to the cold un-
hearing ears his two companions
tramped the vicinity and examined
closely the soft shifting sand though
so loose that the imprint of their steps
was at once half filled and blurred be-
yond identification nevertheless it was
plain enough that the poor girl had
come from the steep descent- in the
ravine at the head of the bay and
strolled toward the firm smooth floor
left by the receding tide half-way
to it she had halted then apparently
returned a few paces and there sud-
denly turned and run for the line of
great boulders that strewed the foot
of the sheer cliff the nearest of the
two giant black arms enclosing her

  this absurd turning and haste was
so apparent that it was obvious some-
thing had intercepted her return and
she had madly raced for the only
shelter at hand but not a third of
the distance had been covered when a
most astounding thing had happened

  for the tracks vanished not a trace
of her step was visible in the space of
at least a dozen feet that lay between
the last deep slurred indentation and
the dead girl

  but for these two searchers the
strange fact would have escaped no-
tice for at dawn the feet of many
shocked friends had quite obliterated
every trace of her movements at the
inquest the affair was sworn to by the
discoverers but excited little com-
ment for other even stranger matters
occupied the attention of the astound-
ed and baffled inquiry yet to the two
witnesses that void space the visible
evidence of a thing unknown and in-
conceivable was the most appalling
memory they retained and for many
a night they pondered over it and
spoke darkly of things evil and ma-
lignant that of old they had heard
their fathers fathers declare roamed
such desolate places and the cheery
lamplight within seemed more com-
forting than ever they had known it

 but men of learning and those
skilled in the murky labyrinths of evil
vainly sought to elucidate the matter
even a great surgeon from the city
had willingly found time to assist at
the autopsy summoned by a wire from
an humble country medico who
nevertheless in college had ranked
higher than his famous chum and in
terms unintelligible to the lay mind
the two had agreed and wrangled
throughout one whole night until the
gray of dawn had sent the visitor has-
tening back to waiting patients his
last words as he pressed the starter
were   thanks slater the most amaz-
ing case i ever encountered-most in-
teresting but what the deuce caused
it i havent a notion  

  as with an earlier verdict those few
curt words summed the facts the
strictest probing had elicited well
they might for never a bruise or the
least abrasion lay upon the poor body
yet of blood not a drop remained
within it and as in the case of young
symington the staggering complete-
the flying death



ness of the extravasation was an
anomaly to science the tissues being
disrupted in the selfsame violent man-
ner and every exposed surface of epi-
dermis betraying a like eruptive dis-
figurement though the body was
otherwise not mutilated the examina-
tion was unhindered by the shocking
maceration that symingtons corpse
had suffered in spite of this the ver-
dict was identical murder but no
evidence of how or by whom com-
mitted  

again the great presses roared in
their pangs of conceiving columns
that dripped with adjectives and
horror and staider prints admitted
frankly that the tragedy had really
happened and in them learned men
penned articles that meandered
through the dictionary and seemed
very wise and conclusive but left the
reader wondering what it was all
about yet oddly comforted that such
men lived to deal with these ghastly
enigmas as coolly and confidently as
though the solution were concealed in
tomes of algebra or differential cal-
culus

  but the great public whose emo-
tions feed on simpler diet just won-
dered and thrilled with the horror of
that strange pitiless slaying and
throbbed with pity for an old broken-
hearted man mourning his only child
yet lacking fuel to keep alight the
gracious fire of sympathy it shortly
expired just as reports of vast calami-
ties in foreign lands flame dazzlingly
for a moment in our mental firma-
ment then flicker and vanish as
another star leaps above the horizon
and outlives its predecessor

  probably sooner or later there would
have been other victims and by chance
some terror-stricken witness to afford
humanity the first inkling of the grav-
est peril that has ever beset it but it
so happened that philip daimler the
talented painter and his friend rich-
ard messinger the well known curator

of the geological section of the jack-
son institute were the first to solve
the mystery of the two terrible slay-
ings and in detail render an account
of the fearful assailant-a relation
that left humanity gasping and be-
wildered as we realized our impotence
to combat the menace that now must
be reckoned with in a twinkling it
had thrust our species back a hundred
thousand years to days when the sur-
vival of our hirsute ancestors trem-
bled in the balance and only by a
miracle escaped from the chaos of
ravening monsters to become the domi-
nant masters of their destiny but
now as well or better might we plan
to clear the black depths of the oceans
of the monstrous octopi that lurk a
hundred fathoms below the surface in-
vincible in their murky kingdom and
calmly awaiting the diving leviathans
or foundered floating palaces to ap-
pease their gargantuan appetites

  it might have been better had we
never learnt the truth never awak-
ened to the fact that after all our
thousands of years of striving cease-
less war with ruthless creatures pride
of victory and attainment after all
we are not the lords of creation and
though in no danger of a world-wide
catastrophe yet neither science po-
lice nor politics can guarantee protec-
tion in the future to the individual
now the serene cerulean dome has lost
its divinity for we know that merci-
less malignancy is hidden in its pro-
fundity  and the seductive peace of the
green country the charm of solitude
must forever be haunted by the dread
of impending tragedy only sur-
rounded by our fellows or with walls
enclosing us can we know the security
that once we lightly deemed our heri-
tage

  the relation of their terrible ex-
perience is perhaps more vitally de-
scriptive in the simple words of mes-
singer rather than the later careful
summaries by the learned of the
mere facts shorn of their emotional


weird tales

reactions just as a first impression
often more truly portrays a scene than
does a photograph

  daimler and i said messinger
to the press representatives who
rushed to the village early the follow-
ing morning caiiie here by car yes-
terday as you know daimlers art
is highly imaginative though in detail
truth itself and for a canvas he de-
sired to obtain some studies of the
massive rock formations in this lo-
cality i had been working rather
strenuously of late-a little brochure
on the sedimentaries-and feeling a
trifle stale came with him for a few
days of rest and a mouthful of ozone

  naturally we were not ignorant of
the tragic happenings that had oc-
curred so recently in the neighbor-
hood  but the victims being total
strangers and neither daimler nor i
of hypersensitive disposition we
hardly gave the matter a thought

  last evening about two hours be-
fore sunset-my friend particularly
desired to observe the evening effects
-we set out for ladner bay and
though the road above would have
been much the quicker route yet the
sloping shingle beach was preferable
for daimlers purpose

  daimler carried a small sketching-
outfit and a light folding easel while
i had my old friend a short-hafted
prospectors pick which invariably ac-
companies me on these outings prob-
ably you know the tool-the head is
shaped much like a small pick but one
prong has a flat hammer head i think
it weighs about five pounds but in a
practised hand a surprizingly power-
ful blow can be dealt with it

  to this simple tool my friend owes
his life for lacking it i would have
been quite powerless to aid him as a
matter of fact it was i think probably
the best weapon that could have been
devised for the purpose-the finest
rifle would have been no more effec-
tive than a pea-shooter against that
frightful thing

  my friend had so frequently halt-

ed to admire some wild outline of
crag or boulder that by the time we
arrived at the bay the sun had dipped
behind the western crest of the enclos-
ing cliffs and that side lay in a fast-
extending and deepening shade

     the bay i may remark is a singu-
larly picturesque one it is about half
a mile wide across its mouth and al-
most as much from low tide to the
steep trail in the ravine where the
great walls come together in the bay
the cliffs are higher than elsewhere
and the strata more contorted as
though the spot had been the center
of a violence that had thrown up miles
of towering rock like a feather of
course really the process was an in-
finitely prolonged one the effect of
vast strains and adjustments of the
earths envelope nevertheless one can
not avoid the impression of wrathful
titanic forces unleashed and working
instantaneously

  high water seldom comes more
than half-way over the smooth sands
and the huge sheltering arms afford
ample protection from the northerly
gales that sometimes ravage this coast
therefore fishermen occasionally put
in and wait until the blow is past
i believe the fine sands sometimes at-
tract picnic parties but otherwise it
is as lonely a spot as can be found in
a hundred miles of this coastline the
nearest house is more than a mile
away and of course quite hidden from
the beach the road above is merely a
rough country track and used only by
a few farmers as a means of access to
their widely separated neighbors i
believe one could camp for weeks in
that lonely cove and never a soul be
the wiser

  daimler was delighted with the
wild grandeur of the spot-it was
through my advice he had come-and
for a little he flitted about from one
point to another until the spirit moved
him to set to work while i made for
the foot of the near-by massive wall
and commenced busily with my pick
to remove slabs from the face of it
the flying death



for in this formation not infrequently
were to be found small fossils of
mosses lichens and diminutive crus-
taceans

  some measure of success attend-
ing my labor i became interested and
immersed in the quest and save for
the waning light hardly noticed the
passing of time until i found myself
climbing the steep ascent that leads
to the crest

  this trail is merely the bottom of
a great v-shaped gash that in the
course of years has become partly
filled with fallen fragments and likely
some day will be completely blocked
by them the way is extremely nar-
row and not far from the beach it is
for many yards a mere slit where two
could hardly walk abreast though for
a sheer wall maybe twenty feet high
on each side the ramparts fall back
and ascend in a series of giant steps

 tt was here that daimlers cries
first reached me though he states
that he had shouted several times be-
fore he heard my response a fact for
which a turn of the passage just be-
low me and his rapid approach may
be held accountable at once i an-
swered with a loud  halloo  and com-
menced quickly to retrace my steps
the only thought i held at the mo-
ment was that he had completed his
sketch and not seeing me about had
called to inform me that it was time
to return we had previously agreed
to return by the road for in the
dark the shingle would be rough
walking

  so intent had i been on my chip-
ping that the gathering dusk had
gone almost unnoticed but now i
realized that some time must have
elapsed since i had left him for as
i turned the corner and the bay
opened before me i saw that the
scarlet and crimson of the horizon
were fading and though not a hun-
dred yards distant his figure was
blurred and only just recognizable

  he was coming toward me quick-
ly in fact faster than i ever remem-
mered seeing him move for daimler
though not grossly corpulent is a
big heavy-built man averse to rapid
motion

  at that second he called again
though i do not think he had yet
seen me he seemed to be walking
in a crouching position and his bent
head was foreshortened to half its
normal height above his broad shoul-
ders although as i have stated his
hastening form was somewhat
blurred in the gathering dusk yet
his outline in the main was fairly
well defined bythelighter-liued sands
and sea that lay behind him

   whats the matter i cried
sharply the tone of his cry had
surprized and startled me it was so
undeniably a cry of warning and
agitation but as i called back to
him i was staring at something many
feet away a something that lay a
hundred feet above him

  i had perceived it directly i
turned the bend in the trail for it
was quite impossible to miss its huge
bulk yet one may perceive a strange
and incomprehensible object without
instantly grasping the enormity of its
presence we have lain so long in the
rut of the known that our percep-
tions do not lightly rise out of it
doubtless in the days of king arthur
they were quicker to accept and in-
stantly tabulate the fantastic things
they were taught quite commonly
might be encountered things which
we dismiss with a smile as mere
chimeras of ignorance and auto-sug-
gestion yet now it occurs to me to
wonder whether there is not a base
of fact somewhere or other at the
back of these dragons and ogres
centaurs and satyrs that they so often
engaged in combat for i feel cer-
tain that i too have seen a thing
utterly opposed to sane credence
something abnormal unknown and
very horrible yet as truly a fact as
your presence at this moment


weird tales

  what i stared at was stiange be-
yond imagining above him hovered
-no other word quite conveys the
instant impression i received of con-
scious movement-a something more
resembling an appalling thunder-
cloud condensed or compressed to
an undreamt-of solidity if such a
phenomenon was possible than any-
thing else i can call to mind in con-
veying to you a mental picture of
this thing i am handicaped by hav-
ing to describe something that has
no counterpart in human experience
and benumbs the brain with its stag-
gering incomprehensibility

  viewed as a living entity it
was enormous i should judge fully
thirty or forty feet in diameter
though its circumference was irregu-
lar and its outline so ragged that in
many directions it might be much
more than this figure it seemed to
rise from its edge to a dome center
considerably higher than the stature
of the hastening man beneath it
while underneath it appeared slight-
ly hollowed

  you understand i am giving you
the sum of the impressions i retained
after the encounter and not merely
my first instinctive observations for
it would be tedious if not impossible
to separate my earlier impressions
from later surety

  at the moment my only emotion
was amazement though intertwined
with my amazement there lay a
shrinking a loathing of its abomi-
nable hue which save at the murky
edges was blacker than ink or coal
or night-the black i should imagine
we mean when in the phrase black
as death itself we endeavor to con-
vey a profundity beyond all art to
picture

  daimler of course heard me in
that quiet enclosed spot my voice
seemed swollen unnaturally

   look out messinger the thing
is alive-its going to attack i
think he cried hurriedly and
breathlessly

   alive i exclaimed and al-
though instinctively i knew that it
was indeed a living thing yet the
spoken word shocked me exceeding-
ly nonsense its queerbut-quick
daimler run its dropping i
shouted in a panic of sudden fear
that strangely contradicted my curt
refutation of his assertion

  an instant realization of his
great peril had come upon me as i
saw the outlandish hovering thing
that kept pace with his steps-by
what means it moved i have no no-
tion-abruptly fall for at least a
third of the space between them it
fell just like a stone no planing or
slanting swoop like a hawk at its
quarry but in a flash it was thirty
feet lower and the soughing swish of
its passage was very audible

  as i called daimler leapt for-
ward and commenced a frantic dash
toward me and at the same second
i rushed to meet him exactly how
i expected to aid him i can not say
or indeed what manner of offensive
i could summon in the slightest way
effective against such a monstrous
creature the action was merely a
blind impulse the age-old urge of
combination-the human species ver-
sus all comers

  what this thing was dumfound-
ed me but i was convinced it was
utterly malignant for so close was
it now that i glimpsed the sinuous
rippling that agitated its ragged
edge the thing was visibly throb-
bing with vital life even through
the dusky pall i had seen that every
inch of its surface was swelling sub-
siding and again heaving tumultuous-
ly with the apparently aimless con-
vulsions of a gigantic bunch of
knotted worms possibly part of this
perception arose in a later impres-
sion  i can not be certain for every-
thing passed in a whirl in those tense
seconds but one detail i can state
with certainty occurred in its right-
ful sequence the sound that was
emitted coincidently with its abrupt
the flying death



descent a thin piping sighing filled
the air around me and though so thin
and quavery yet its volume seemed
to saturate the vicinity like the whine
of a horde of tiny mosquitoes i can
not recall that thereafter it ceased
for a moment

tvaimler when he started to run
had not more than fifty yards
to cross to gain whatever shelter the
narrow trail could offer yet before we
met it happened as i ran my eyes
never left the appalling thing and i
saw it quite clearly lessen in its area
there was no warning or any pre-
liminary adjusting it simply shrank
or rather contracted as a length of
slightly stretched elastic on release
diminishes and like it this thing also
thickened or perhaps in view of its
concavity i might better liken the ac-
tion to the half shutting of a huge
umbrella

    then its huge mass had fallen and
it lay exactly where daimler had been
running for an instant i halted and
stood staring blankly at the monstrous
thing just as one stares at an appari-
tion-palsied with fear mute and mo-
tionless then the enormity of the
catastrophe that had overtaken daim-
ler flooded upon me and i hurled my-
self forward frantically calling him
by name

  it seemed like circling a hill for
its summit rose many feet above me
and its height i should judge would
be less than a third of the diameter
and all the time that queer piping
sound was ceaselessly welling from it
only now in volume immensely great-
er and the note much shriller and
more like the escaping of innumerable
little jets of high-pressure steam

  behind that huge palpitating bulk
lay daimler on his back head arms
and shoulders alone were visible be-
low this his form was missing being
covered by his assailant

  he says that something impelled
him at that critical second to hurl
himself backward likely it was an im-

pulse an emergence from the subcon-
scious the mysterious self that gains
its knowledge from unknown channels
at any rate he hurtled backward and
instead of engulfing him the vast hood
caught him a slanting blow and still
further expedited his effort had it
not been for this action beyond any
doubt he would have been instantly
and most horribly smothered

   i cant get clear-and its mov-
ing up he gasped hoarsely as i
rushed to him and slipping my hands
beneath his armpits sought to snatch
him from the loathsome thing but
with all my might and with daimler
thrusting despeiately at the sands i
could not by an inch release him and
beyond the slight natural flexion per-
mitted to the human shoulders i failed
to raise him appreciably

  i stared at the monstrous thing
as the cold sweat of terror poured
profusely from me but daimler
though white and haggard was i
think much the cooler and more col-
lected

   i cant gain an inch what shall
i do i exclaimed hoarsely as i too
saw that the revolting glutinous-look-
ing edge was extending farther over
him it seemed to flow with a rippling
motion outward-the smooth creeping
of a tide of festering slime more solid
than liquid

  now the light was very dim but
the sky being cloudless i could dis-
tinguish in a blurred unreal fashion
that the substance of the thing was
still in a state of ceaseless pulsing
fluxion swelling into ridges and
bosses sinking in grooves and craters
everywhere over a surface as coarsely
wrinkled as the withered skin on the
hands of age

   for gods sake messinger do
something it will be all over with
me in a minute  said daimler tensely
but quietly-i can not too highly rate
his courage

  in a frenzy of despair my eyes
swept the vicinity for anything-
piece of driftwood a boulder even-


weird tales

to batter this nightmare with but the
sands here were far above high water
and bare of a single splinter and the
loose debris fringing the nearest cliff
at least fifty feet distant and at any
second that ghastly living tide might
sweep over its victim

    then my eye alighted on a weapon
that somehow i had forgotten-the
pick at my feet where i had dropped
it these simple tools are marvels of
efficiency and in a practised hand pro-
duce results i do not doubt but with
a single blow i could split the skull
of an ox in a second i had swung it
aloft and at the extreme limit of my
reach dealt the brute a savage stroke
it was indeed fortunate that i had not
hit closer to the edge for i might
easily have seriously wounded if not
slain my friend the eight-inch prong
went through the substance as though
it were butter and haft and hand were
deeply pressed into a soft resilience

  it was as flimsy as a sponge or
rather like hitting a cushion that
would give but not rend before the
mightiest fist yet a child could drive
a pin through it at once there arose
a series of little explosions such as
might be made by the bursting of
small air-filled paper bags or toy
balloons

  astonished but elated by this un-
expected vulnerability instantly -with-
out raising the weapon i raked it
down toward me thus attacked it
was more resistant and i had to exert
some force as if opposed by the strands
of a half-rotten net but i rent it to
where the prong bit into the sand
close beside daimler the deep lacera-
tion closed behind the steel like molten
tar and a line of grayish scum greasy
and frothy welled out to mark the
ravage

  	  all right daimler i  have you
clear in a moment i cried its as
soft as a jelly-fish  i eried exultingly
as i feverishly plied my pick and
with blow after blow roughly raked a
great v-shaped wedge of it to tatters

    nevertheless though i had spoken
so assuredly i was still in a state
of panic for the bulk of the thing
was so appalling that my efforts
seemed those of a pigmy assailing a
whale with a bodkin every second i
expected to see some vast movement
convulse it some gigantic offensive
that would erase us both as simply as
my hand would crush a mosquito
moreover each blow was meeting with
a greater resistance and if my attack
was to be confined merely to stabbing
the prong into it then my friend was
doomed to a certainty for if i could
not weaken it by scoring the portion
that lay above him i realized that
there was no hope of saving him so
rigidly did this nightmare confine him
that it seemed as if they were cement-
ed together or welded by suction like
a glutinous limpet to a rock and of
course in spite of its loose construc-
tion this stupendous brute must have
weighed tons

 crom start to finish the whole ex-

  - perience could only have been a
matter of moments but to me the time
seemed infinite

  i ceased to attack the inner mass
and confined my blows to the edge
about the prisoner it was much
tougher but i tore it to pieces for a
couple of feet inward

   quick daimler put all your
strength to it i cried as dropping
the pick again i caught him under
the shoulders and strove to pull him
from under whether unaided we
would have been successful i can not
say but aid came from a most unex-
pected quarter

  i suppose even that unnatural
monster possessed the rudiments of
feeling and its wounding reached some
center of sensation for suddenly it
shook-one might better say shud-
dered-violently and there came a
shrinking a sort of retrogression of
the wounded portion into itself and a
the flying death



wavelike shaking and rippling agi-
tated the entire monster

   its loosening put every ounce
of strength into it i gasped as i
heaved desperately at the broad
shoulders-and moved them  sway-
ing him from side to side inch by
inch i drew him clear to the waist
then abruptly resistance ceased and i
went sprawling he was free and
groaning and attempting to rise as i
picked myself up and leapt to his
side

 lean on me weve got to
reach the trail-its the only shelter
about here i panted winded by my
efforts and the fall

  	 somehow i got him standing and
with my arm about him we started
at a tangent to clear the throbbing
horror and made with all speed we
could summon for the trail lurch-
ing and stumbling-for as i have
said daimler is a big heavy man and
now was badly shaken and benumbed
by the pressure he had borne-we
circled the brute and though in the
blurring dusk i had but a hasty
glimpse of its black immensity yet
at once i saw that it had become even
larger than a moment back and the
throbbing had changed to a swaying
motion that went from side to side
at once i guessed the truth

   my god daimler the brute is
rising-we must go quicker i
hoarsely whispered somehow fearing
that even a whisper would precipi-
tate another attack

 i heard the staggering mans
breath indrawn with terror and felt
his form stiffen and strain to further
effort but a shambling amble was the
utmost we could manage my spirit
fairly crawled within me as every
step of that slow passage i felt that
escape was impossible and any
second we might be dashed headlong
with the blackness of unimaginable
night and tons of living pulp smoth-
ering us

  but at last unharmed we reached
the ascent and staggered up until the

walls closed in and we neared the
narrow slit where i had been chip-
ping and which now offered our only
refuge here we halted for a mo-
ment

   i think we are fairly safe now
thank heaven said i fervently as i
peered back into the blur of the bay
only a toneless pearly gray remained
of the many-hued sunset but one
could distinguish quite well the cliffs
and the sands and the darker band
of sea beyond and all that colorless
expanse was solitary and nothing
met the eye but the natural and the
explainable

   why its gone i exclaimed in
surprize and relief

   no look up there messinger
said daimler in a shaking whisper as
he clutched at my arm

  i suppose by recent association
of space and horror instinctively he
had sought the quarter from which
that horror had been born i fol-
lowed his lifted pointing arm and
there floated the beast level with the
cliff crest and directly above us and
as i fearfully stared it dropped a
little lower and lay between the
upper outflung sides of the gorge

   its coming down quick into
the shelter ahead  i urged in a panic

     shelter where  asked daim-
ler eagerly

   just above-the passage is so
narrow it couldnt reach us there
i replied regaining some confidence
as i thought of the deep narrow cleft
ahead

  in a moment we had stumbled up
the steep slope and stood between
the sheer walls that for thirty or
forty feet lay so close together that
we could only just stand abreast and
stare up at the thing that loomed so
menacingly against the infinite gray
behind it but now i had less fear
for i felt it was impossible that such
ahuge mass could ever penetrate into
our shelter and probably the brute
was of the same opinion for it made
no further attempt to attack us but


weird tales

lay motionless for a few minutes as
though gloomily pondering over the
matter

  then in a flash it had gone i had
just an impression of a huge expan-
sion like a roller-blind snatched
across the sky and then it was thou-
sands of feet above us and appeared
no larger than a tablecloth and as
harmless in the flick of an eyelid
followed another extension and in-
stant diminution to a mere smudge
that for an instant floated in pro-
fundity and after that all trace of
it vanished and for a moment i was
left awed by the imagination of pro-
digious heights and a lone monster
fearlessly navigating the silent in-
finite void beyond

   its gone this time anyway i
heard daimler mutter and at his
voice i returned to solid earth and
things understandable

   yes i hope forever to the hell
it came from said i savagely but
wed better move before they cast it
out with other stunts to try on us

 at once we climbed the steep
ascent and on the crest stood for an
instant to ease the distress that now
acutely beset daimler no longer
spurred by imminent danger he com-
plained of pain and weakness in his
limbs faintness and dizziness and
would have lain on the rocks and
coarse grass but fearing the relaxa-
tion might incapacitate him i sternly
refused to allow it

  while we stood resting my gaze
wandered with loathing over the
somber solitude that lay below us
and unbidden there came to me a
thought of the poor girl who found
death awaiting her in this treacher-
ous loneliness-a tragedy which as
i now recalled had never been
solved even as daimlers fate if he
had been solitary

   my god of course-that night-
mare lrom space i muttered aghast
at the thought of that horror for i
knew beyond a shadow of doubt that

i had solved the mystery of harriet
conroys slaying

  come on daimler i urged
hoarsely

hphe rest of the story gentlemen
is of no moment eventually
we reached a farmhouse and secured
a conveyance to this inn today my
friend is confined to his bed so
bruised in limb and racked with
nausea that i do not anticipate he
will be fit to leave it for several days
the local man-dr slater-assures
me that save for shock and this se-
vere bruising my friend is as sound
as ever but he awaits a friend of
his a famous specialist with much
impatience to learn his opinion it
seems that they collaborated in the
examination of certain extraordinary
phases at the poor girls inquest
recently and with this new evidence
on the matter he is anxious that i
should meet him and relate otir as-
tounding and terrible experience
moreover i understand that still an-
other tragedy is linked with this lo-
cality i mean the fate of young
symington-you know i am but little
interested in such matters being i
suppose of skeptical temperament
and completely immersed in my pro-
fession and having no time to waste
on the merely sensational though i
have some recollection of the affair
but very fragmentary and certainly
nothing on which to found any con-
clusion of resemblance yet dr
slater assures me that our encounter
with this unique assailant has forged
the key to an otherwise inexplicable
tragedy doubtless the whole mat-
ter will receive the closest official at-
tention even not improbably a
world-wide investigation and some
definite conclusions and co-operation
of offensive-if possible-be arrived
at for i can not eonceive of a
greater catastrophe to humanity
than the existence in numbers of
such monstrous malignant creatures
the flying death



one shrinks appalled at the thought
of their size their powers and their
immunity from detection

  this new science of aviation
why one of those brutes could over-
whelm a zeppelin and in a moment
cast it a flaming heap of junk to
destruction and a dozen could clear
the skies of every flying-machine the
world could gather together and
make of aviation just another term
for certain suicide for how can one
combat a creature that with the
speed of a falling stone comes out of
nothingness invisible until the dark-
ness of death is smothering you

  what this creature is i have no
notion whether a single survival of
our planets early abortions or a
type evolved in comparatively recent
times along a line and in an environ-
ment we from inability to exploie
have never thought of these are
enigmas that only research and fur-
ther evidence can elucidate all i
know to a certainty is that my sense
of peace and security has vanished
for ever the nature i have been wed-
ded to the lonely loveliness i have
loved now all is profitless-it is ab-
horrent  for what i have seen will
dog my memory to my last day

ouch deleting a few repetitions was
 the narrative of richard messin-
ger and in the main is the extent of
our knowledge today of the creature
that popular misconception has
christened  the flying death   for
as yet no fresh witness has arisen to
affirm or deny the particulars he has
given

  speculations learned treatises and
discursive theories exist by the
dozen proving that the monster is
mentioned allegorically in the bible
or was known to the chinese before
confucius or has no existence-are
there not persons who affirm that the
world is flat and ignore the certain
evidence to the contrary

  but the world has no doubt that

this thing exists-a nightmare that
can prey on humanity with the case
and impunity of a cat catching mice
for immersed in alcohol in a glass
jar in the great metropolitan muse-
um theie lies one item of incontro-
vertible evidence of the creatures
unique and terrorizing ability to
destroy as it will and when it lists
and marveling crowds daily read
the inscription beneath it

  thus preserved for perpetuity lies
a fragment a mere strip-though
originally somewhat larger the van-
dals of science having wrought on it
-the size of ones middle finger
that messingers pick had torn from
the monster in this liquid it looks
exactly like a greasy saturated
sponge of the coarse dark-hued
variety used in garages and for win-
dow cleaning it was salvaged by a
farmhand who early on the spot the
following morning had disturbed a
horde of gulls which were screaming
and squabbling on the sands above
high water just in the nick of time
he arrived to secure this moisel the
last of a banquet the feasters had
been enjoying consumed with the
glory of his discovery he had straight-
way sought the authorities and
turned it over and finding his name
mispelt in the papers had felt amply
rewarded

  lengthy and exhaustive examina-
tion of this fragment lias resulted in
some startling conclusions about the
interior economy of its former owner
and its marvelous adaptation to alti-
tudes so vast that the most daring
aviator has never more than touched
their fringe we know for a cer-
tainty that its substance is as light
and strong as a feather elastic and
permeated by innumerable tiny cells
miniature bladders void of contents
connecting one with another by a net-
work of small channels

  primarily it was conceived that as
with some species of fish these empty
containers might be used for the
storage of air to render the brute


weird tales

buoyant but this -would in no way
account for its superb powers of
levitation in a like medium then
under chemical analysis distinct
traces of the gas hydrogen were
found to be present at once the
secret was revealed for this gas is
the lightest of all the vapors and was
used in all our great airships until
helium though heavier was found to
be safer being non-inflammable un-
doubtedly this monster possesses the
ability to separate the gas from the
humid vapor always more or less
present in our atmosphere the
process is probably of chemico-eleetrie
nature and instantaneous in action
which though very astounding is no
more so than the extraction of oxygen
from water with every inflating of
the lungs of a fish

  such an inflation of a tenuous
elastic fabric would result in just
such an instantaneous levitation as
messinger described and when the
hydrogen was expelled and the struc-
ture contracted a falling stone would
hardly drop quicker the miracle
lies really in the amazing control and
nicety of manipulation of its medium
of locomotion but then all living
creatures save man control their
movements with a like perfection of
accuracy

  by a little shrewd reasoning it has
been deduced that its natural habitat
is probably within the tropics where
the humidity is greater than our
latitudes and for some unknown mo-
tive we have been visited by a lone
strayer from its fellows possibly the
moment of the odd chance in a mil-

lion that has peopled continents has

dawned for their species

  it certainly is strange that all wild
tribes dwelling near the equator are
ridden by the fear of monstrous
shapeless evil things that assail the
night wanderer who at dawn is found
lifeless and withered with the terror
of that encounter we have deemed
these stories superstition but the fear
is a living force and must be based
on something to dominate millions as
it does

  no explanation of the extraor-
dinary mutilation of each of its vic-
tims lias yet been advanced all we
can conceive is an organism endowed
with a means of imbibing sustenance
much as a vastly magnified reproduc-
tion of the apparatus of the common
mosquito-a lower surface with an
infinite number of hairlike filaments
each the counterpart of that insects
proboscis and similarly provided with
an irritant poison that draws the
blood of a victim to the inserted
borers

  but this is mere theory and may
be right or may be wrong and well
it will be for us if the truth is never
known and this the brutes last ap-
pearance  though several inexplicable
disappearances have recently oc-
curred among our flying men-craft
and men have vanished from our
world as though they had found an-
other and been unable to return and
yet the daring adventurers fly still
higher seeking the thing that dwells
in the unknown beyond and these
missing craft may have encountered
it

the signora beatrice lay
dead perfumed and enshroud-
ed in the junetime of her
life and the proud old neapolitan
who had been her husband sat near
dumb with the love of his young
bride

  silent forms passed in and out
they made no attempt at speech with
the master of the palazzo his look
and attitude forbade it even the
entrance of carmina and the count-
ess valeria who had been very dear
to the dead drew from him no sign
of recognition they passed over to
the bier and hung shaken with sobs
above the beautiful form carmina
a tiny passionate creature stooped
and touched the darkly fringed lids

  oh i know carina these glorious
eyes could not go on longer smiling
a lie so you closed them forever
you were forced to give up don or-
lino for the wealth you despised
now all we have of you is this
again she bent and passionately
kissed the cold still face why did
you do it darling why why   

  the countess tenderly slipped an
arm about the hysterical girl and
gently drew her from the death-
chamber

  by some magnetic current some
miracle an echo of the words reached
the grief-stricken husband hitherto
deaf to all around him and had they
two glanced back they would have
seen a changed man his form stiff-


weird tales

ened into a sudden erectness and
flames leaped to his olive cheeks

 don orlino don orlino the
name rang on his emptiness a deeper
knell

  ignoring her love for another he
had won through the pressure of her
parents and claimed the hand of the
radiantly beautiful beatrice he
never dreamed in his vanity and self-
complacency that the heart of his
bride would yearn in the midst of
the splendors he could provide for
the summer hours spent with her for-
saken love he took pride in her
beauty grace and intellect rapidly
and gloriously for mm the days flew
by in his fevered happiness he
could not see the decline in his wife
that was visible to all the shock of
her death froze his heart and he
too had been as one dead from that
first dark instant until the words of
carmina touched him like a flame
from hell

 he strode across the room and
gazed fiercely down on the lifeless
eyes all the blood in his body
seemed striving for outlet at temples
and throat

    say they so  say they so his
voice sounded strangely thin and
sharp like the cut of a lash that
don orlino had thus effectively
snatched my heaven from me if i
believed it true i would kill him-
yes kill him miserably the words
trailed away to a husky whisper

  after that he no longer sat un-
noticing pie eagerly scanned every-
one who approached the lovely dead
but no soldier form with martial
bearing entered to offer itself to a
jealous husbands vengeance and
finally they laid the signora beatrice
in the family vault without don
orlino having looked on her dead
face

daily sardinossa wended his way
to her resting-place and put fresh
flowers on her satin shroud this
duty he reserved for himself alone

no other hand was allowed to touch
the adored form agonizingly he
waited for the first sign of the deadly
decay those who served him feared
for his reason when it should make
its appearance but it tarried long
and every day new-blown flowers
were necessary to match the surpass-
ing loveliness of the dead womans
face

  finally the strange truth was evi-
dent to all and with overwhelming
joy was borne in on the doting hus-
band she was petrifying petrify-
ing he cried the word aloud and
asked in wild-eyed exultation of those
about him if they realized that the
ravaging worm had been held at bay
that the cycling stars could record
no destruction of her beauty that
the face of his beatrice would be his
to look on as long as life was allowed
him the vault became for him a
shrine and many trancelike hours
were spent within its silent precincts

  one evil day the rumor reached
him that the shrine had a rival dev-
otee that one came often during the
reign of the full moon who feasted
long on the beauty of the dead brides
face a horrible suspicion thrilled
through him like the touch of a live
wire and mad passions unleashed in
his heart rendered him deaf and
dumb and blind

  that night the moon would be full
in a fever he waited the waning of
the day he seemed hours within the
moon-drenched tomb when at last a
quick step without made him hastily
regain his place of concealment be-
hind a fluted column

  a key grated in the lock and the
stalwart young form of don orlino
stood silhouetted in the entrance
evidently he lmew the exact moment
to come the moment when the moon
would serve him when no artificial
light would be necessary that might
betray his tryst with the dead

  the moonbeams had just crept
through the barred window and soft-
ly outlined the marble form in its
the tryst in the tomb



light the white shroud shimmered and
the still face shone wondrously
hauntingly beautiful

  only the dawning of a ghastly
hideous determination kept the bereft
husband from springing upon don
orlino and choking him to death as
he watched him rain kisses on the be-
loved eyes and lips and hair a fury
of fiendish hate shook his heart al-
most audibly as the minutes of the
strange love-tryst waned and there
was a mad hilarity in his eyes as he
watched the reluctant departure of
don orlino

 he crept from the shadows and
leaned ghastly pale above the
shrouded corpse all the love all the
worship were gone from his eyes
only a searing withering hate for
her too shone in them

 so you went to him through
death as they said the tremulous
quavering of his tone manifested the
descent of a sudden insanity well
by the most terrible god through
death he shall go to you

  the following day and two there-
after workmen were busy within the
tomb at a task over which they great-
ly wondered what did the grand
signor want with the carefully hewn-
out niche in the vaulted wall and the
heavy iron gate that enclosed it from
ceiling to floor did he intend to
place the gentle signora beatrice
erect within it after the fashion of
the ancient egyptians two shook
their heads gravely over the contem-
plated desecration but the third
shrugged his shoulders indifferently
and went on with his work arguing
that there was no accounting for the
vagaries of the rich and powerful

  when their work was completed
sardinossa came to look it over and
astounded the three with the munifi-
cence of his reward a diabolical ex-
ultation swept over him as he tested
the working of the iron gate it
swung to swiftly easily with a click
that spoke for the security of its

fastenings then consumed with a
malignant eagerness he watched the
daylight die

  it is inconceivable with what satis-
faction he dwelt on the carrying out
of the horrible purpose that possessed
him he had a task before him a
diabolical task which must be per-
formed his soul was on fire to ac-
complish it speedily and well

mookrise found sardinossa in the
region of the tomb and a smile
or rather a hideous grimace wrinkled
his countenance as don orlinos
shadow fell long on the silvered grass
he allowed time for the caresses that
maddened him then moved in the
direction of the tomb

  at the sound of his footstep don
orlino surprized and startled stood
erect and faced the entrance the
two men stared at each other for a
full half-minute

  sardinossa was the first to break
the silence rather a tardy visit
this don orlino you never honored
us so during the ladys lifetime his
voice was steady and betrayed no
sign of the black purpose hidden in
his soul

  that it was impossible will always
be counted my greatest regret re-
plied don orlino

  one can readily believe that who
sees you take this time and this place
to recompense yourself for impossible
or neglected visits

  the biting sarcasm of his tone sent
the hot blood to don orlinos face
and warm words to his lips

  sardinossa beatrice was as you
know once the dream of my life if
she ever was of yours then you knew
the ecstasy of its realization this
-he pointed dramatically to the
moon-bathed figure-was its nearest
fulfilment for me of course i do
not expect you to approve-

  on the contrary interrupted
sardinossa strange as it may seem
you will find that i shall expend spe-


weird tales

cial effort in assisting you to a fuller
realization of your dream do not
think i shall forbid you the place
indeed you may consider it yours
from tonight forth

  the tenseness of the voice the cold
light in the eye like the flash of steel
on steel the ominous calm before the
storm-all were lost on don orlino
in the joy of the privilege granted
his cherished love with its mingled
grief and pain made him the soldier
and strategist like an unsuspecting
child in the hands of this finished
master of cunning

  they tell me you come always at
night when the moon is full sar-
dinossas cold even voice again woke
the echoes of the tomb

  don orlino started sardinossa had
been aware then of the stolen vigils
for the first time don orlino some-
what distrustful of the apparent calm
searched sardinossas face for a sign
of suppressed passion but it was
bland smiling

  i thought perhaps the almost
sarcastic tones went on the moon
might enhance charms already more
than heart-breaking so i came to
see

  that were impossible don or-
lino returned passionately beatrice
was and remains beautiful in all
lights at all times i come at night
because she gave you the right to come
in the daylight to love to adore be-
fore men for me she left only this
tryst in the tomb these stolen mo-
ments can you not understand can
you not pity

  the old eyes flamed with a horrid
mirth yes i can understand i can
pity you will not long be without
an evidence of the fact a short
hard laugh finished the remark evi-
dently the laugh was involuntary and
instantly regretted for he went on
with an undue haste and overdone
affability of one thing i have as-
sured myself that the cold damp at-
mosphere of the vault at night is not

for the old it has stiffened my knees

painfully he stooped and pressed
them in a helpless manner my stick
i left it there he pointed toward
the newly made niche at the foot of
the casket

  don orlino sprang in the direction
indicated and felt about for the stick
unable to find it he moved closer to
the wall and felt about more care-
fully

  like a flash the old form unbent
and with the speed of a tiger in ac-
tion sardinossa had crossed the little
space and swung shut the gate on his
victim

  startled don orlino struggled
about in the narrow enclosure and
faced a fiend incarnate blue light-
nings leaped from sardinossas gloat-
ing eyes and his voice was like the
taunt of a demon

  now realize to the full your
dream-look your fill sardinossa
spat out the words you see i have
placed you conveniently at her feet
and when the extremity of hunger
and thirst begins to burn and torture
curse her curse love curse god and
die  

  he darted a final glance of undying
hate at don orlino who stood mag-
nificently defiant like an american
indian at the torture going out he
locked the tomb and turned his back
on it forever

years after when the body of
sardinossa was brought home
from a foreign land for burial those
who entered the tomb with the re-
mains shrank back in terror there
were sharp cries with a thud that
echoed dismally the coffin slipped
from their trembling hands and
powerless to withdraw their eyes they
gazed with unutterable horror on the
ghastly monument sardinossa had
raised to the green-eyed monster

  behind the bars of the gate gleam-
ing white and ghostly and hung with
the tryst in the tomb



tatters of moldering garments was
the skeleton of don orlino

his cavernous eyes were fixed on
the statuesque dead and dangling

down against the protruding ribs just
where the noble heart once beat was
an ivory miniature of the laughing
girl-face of the lady of his worship

the fairy court

the people of the middle ages
supposed those imaginary be-
ings whom they called fairies
to be organized into a kingdom just
as were human peoples oberon was
their king by many writers he was
claimed to be the offspring of julius
caesar and a fairy usually known as
morgan le fay though the italians
called her fata morgana it was
probably from this union that the
term morganatic marriage origi-
nally meaning a marriage of two
people in widely different spheres
originated

  in old british legend however
morgan le fay was a sister of the
mythical king arthur and had her
home in that beautiful isle of
avalon where souls leaving earth
were restored to eternal youth she
was the one who revealed to arthur
the intrigue of his wife guinevere
with lancelot in ariostos orlando
furioso early sixteenth century
fata morgana is represented as dis-
pensing all the treasures of earth
and as inhabiting a palace at the
bottom of a lake the italians still
give the name fata morgana to the
mirages which appear on their coast

  there is some disagreement over
the name of oberons queen some

earlier writers give her name as mab
but the bulk of the evidence seems to
be that queen mab was the fairies
midwife-that is the fairy whose
duty it is to deliver the fancies of
men and to cause dreams by pinching
the sleeper whispering in his ear or
driving over him in her chariot
shakespeare represents her as not
only adept in teasing and mischief
but as the hag nightmare in person
spenser in his faerie queene gives
the queens name as gloriana in
later years titania is mentioned as
the queen though shakespeare is the
first writer known to have used this
name	-

  in pooles parnassus  the
persons of the fairy court are given
as follows oberon the emperor mab

the tenant at
number seven

by august w derleth

me john paddon got onto
the car at charing cross
station and settled himself
for a long ride into the northern part
of the city mr paddon was an an-
tiquary and he had only just now
closed his shop having had to keep
open much longer than usual to satis-
fy the whim of a late customer who
had after all bought scantily a
small mean-looking man mr pad-
don reflected who had begged him
to sell him the grotesque medallion at
a lower price than the tag called for
mr paddons thoughts revolved
about the man and from him moved
very naturally to the roman medal-
lion found it was said at york mr
paddon had his doubts for he was
inclined to regard all antiques with
a dubious eye but after all it was
not really his business whether they
were antiques or not

  it was not often that mr paddon
took a late underground when he
thought of how late he would get
home he made a grimace of annoy-
ance at the same moment lie looked
lip and came face to face with his
late customer mr paddon won-
dered whether he should nod the
customer however made no sign of
recognition the man was decidedly
mean-looking mr paddon observed
uneasily almost unconsciously he
began to wish that he had sold him
the medallion even at the risk of a
slight loss he resolved to keep a
careful eye on the man

    

   however it was soon evident that
 the customer either did not remem-
 ber mr paddon or did not wish to
 do so mr paddons apprehension
 left him and he began to scrutinize
 the man he smiled discreetly at the
 beaver hat and the old-fashioned
 square spectacles and followed the
 heavy black muffler from the mans
 throat to where it stuck out below
 his shabby jacket the face above
 the muffler looked very old but the
 thin lips were firm and the tuft of
 grizzled hair on the chin was not
 totally white the small eyes behind
 the spectacles were black the nose
 was sharply aquiline and mr pad-
 don found himself wondering how
 the man would look if it were slightly
 curved

   quite suddenly the man looked up
 and stared fully at mr paddon the
 antiquary immediately buried his
 head in the times in a moment he
 looked cautiously over the top of the
 paper and found his late customer
 still regarding him thoughtfully mr
 paddon bent again to his paper nor
 did he look up again until the motor-
 man called out his station

   mr paddon discovered that his
 late customer was also leaving the
 underground at st johns wood
 road at once his apprehension
 seized mr paddon again he de-
 cided hurriedly that if the man
 should come back to the shop on the
 following day he should have the
 medallion at his price but when
the tenant at number seven



mr paddon stepped from the ear he
was alone there was no one about
eor a moment the antiquary enter-
tained the idea that the man was
about to ambush him but he immedi-
ately dismissed it as absurd and
walked home

the following day was foggy the
air was uncomfortably heavy and
drops of water came out of the yel-
low and gray mist and struck mr
paddon as he walked swiftly from
the station to his antique shop he
entered his shop with a sigh of relief
and closed the door hastily to shut out
the fog that billowed inward he
drew off his gloves and put them to-
gether with his cane on the coun-
ter his greatcoat and hat he hung
on a convenient suit of armor near
the door then he settled himself
on a stool behind the counter put on
his spectacles and assumed an air of
great importance hardly had he
done so when he discovered not three
feet from him the customer of the
night before

  mr paddon stared at him for a
moment as if unable to comprehend
his appearance it was almost as if
he had materialized from the suit of
armor near the door toward which
mr paddon involuntarily looked
mr paddon had not heard the door
open with a half-apologetic smile
the antiquary returned his attention
to his customer

  well sir he began i suppose
youve come after that medallion

  if i could have it for five pounds
sir id take it the mans face did
not change he stared steadily at mr
paddon

  well sir id about decided last
night that you could have it at five
pounds-though its a sacrifice sir
and ill never do it again

  the customers expression did not
change

  but continued mr paddon
somewhat flustered i dont suppose
id ever have the chance to sell it

again for some time so its just as
well that it goes by the way what
is your name   

 gaunt benjamin gaunt

 and address

seven st johns wood terracem
its just in case of something
turning up regarding it-you cant
ever tell in this business its always
better to have a record

  mr paddon placcd the medallion
on the counter and reached for paper
in which to wrap it the customer
reached for the medallion

  you neednt wrap it ill take it
just this way

  as you please sir mr paddon
smiled the customer nodded curtly
and deposited several coins upon the
counter then he turned and walked
quickly to the door mr paddon
took up the coins the door closed
softly

  mr paddon stopped in the act of
depositing the coins in the register to
look at them more closely they
were coins of queen victoria he
glanced to where mr gaunt had
rested against the counter there
were no marks there-nothing at all
to indicate that mr gaunts clothing
had been dampened by the london
mists

the door of mr paddons antique
shop opened to admit a middle-aged
man who entered with a great bustle
and noise and almost knocked mr
paddons walking-stick from the suit
of armor from a pocket of his
greatcoat he took a catalogue which
mr paddon recognized as one that
he had sent out some days before
mr paddon eyed his customer over
his spectacles and fixed a benevolent
stare on his visitors chubby red
cheeks

  mr paddon the customer be-
gan im james conroyd-youve
got my name on your mailing-list
some days ago you sent out a cata-
logue in which you describe a roman
medallion-the particular medallion


weird tales

that ive been searching for half my
life ive good reason to believe that
its the very medallion i lost years
ago where did you get hold of it
by the way

why i-i havent any idea mr
conroyd perhaps i could look it up
but its pretty hard to keep account
never mind let me see it will
you

  im sorry said mr paddon
looking rather futile but i sold it
not ten minutes ago  

  mr conroyd opened his eyes wide
you sold it to whom if i may
ask

  to a mr benjamin gaunt
why thats the man i bought it
from the only other man who was
looking for the medallion gets here
before i do you see mr paddon
some years ago when i was little
more than a kid i bought the thing
from gaunt for five pounds

  thats what i sold it to him for
thats a coincidence after id
bought it from him he was con-
tinually pestering me to sell it back
to him i never would have sold it
to him but one day i lost it sud-
denly mr conroyds face underwent
a change he stared at mr paddon
who smiled respectfully then sud-
denly his face flushed angrily say
listen i dont know what your idea
is but you faked this fellows name
benjamin gaunt died five years
ago  

  mr paddon looked his dismay he
felt suddenly horribly useless and
hastened to assure mr conroyd that
he had sold the medallion to mr
benjamin gaunt

no no mr conroyd i sold it
to a man who gave me that name
did he give you his address
asked mr conroyd his eyes narrow-
ing in suspicion

  yes its seven st johns wood
terrace  

  could you go out there with me
mr paddon im bound to have that

medallion-no matter what i pay
for it

  well

  ill pay you for your time

  mr paddon looked dubiously at
the fog outside then back at his eager
visitor yes he said ill go

seven st johns wood terrace
was not difficult to find every-
one seemed to know of it and when
the antiquary and his customer asked
about it they were treated to curious
stares and in some cases discreet
smiles seven st johns wood ter-
race was a deserted house in its last
stages not a window-pane remained
in the ramshackle structure and
there were no doors the shingles
were green with moss and the chim-
ney had crumbled long before there
was no longer a discernible path lead-
ing to the door

  well said mr paddon should
we go in

  i suppose we might as well see-
ing weve come this far

  the two men hesitated a moment
and looked about them and back at
the house before they walked slowly
up to the structure they entered
their footprints broke into the dust
of years as they went from room to
room

  in a little chamber in the back of
the house mr conroyd found the
roman medallion on the table were
marks disturbing the dust where the
medallion had been thrown in one
corner of the room lay an old beaver
hat damaged beyond repair there
were no footprints in the room nor
could the men find where the medal-
lion had entered

said mr conroyd picking up the
hat

  quite near the table covered with
dust mr paddon noticed a black
muffler some distance away lay all
that was left of a pair of square
spectacles
the legend of sleepy hollow

by washington irving

in the bosom of one of those
spacious coves which indent the
eastern shore of the hudson at
that broad expansion of the river de-
nominated by the ancient dutch navi-
gators the tappan zee and where
they always prudently shortened sail
and implored the protection of st
nicholas when they crossed there lies
a small market-town or rural port
which by some is called greensburgh
but which is more generally and
properly known by the name of tarry
town this name was given we are
told in former days by the good
housewives of the adjacent country
from the inveterate propensity of
their husbands to linger about the vil-
lage tavern on market days be that
as it may i do not vouch for the fact
but merely advert to it for the sake
of being precise and authentic not
far from this village perhaps about
two miles there is a little village or
rather lap of land among high hills
which is one of the quietest places in
the whole world a small brook
glides through it with just murmur
enough to lull one to repose and the
occasional whistle of a quail or tap-
ping of a woodpecker is almost the
only sound that ever breaks in upon
the uniform tranquillity

  i recollect that when a stripling

my first exploit in squirrel-shooting
was in a grove of tall walnut-trees
that shades one side of the valley i
had wandered into it at noontime
when all nature is peculiarly quiet
and was startled by the roar of my
own gun as it broke the sabbath still-
ness around and was prolonged and
reverberated by the angry echoes if
ever i should wish for a retreat
whither i might steal from the world
and its distractions and dream quiet-
ly away the remnant of a troubled
life i know of none more promising
than this little valley

  from the listless repose of the
place and the peculiar character of
its inhabitants who are descendants
from the original dutch settlers this
sequestered glen has long been known
by the name of sleepy hollow and
its rustic lads are called the sleepy
hollow boys throughout all the neigh-
boring country a drowsy dreamy
influence seems to hang over the land
and to pervade the very atmosphere
some say that the place was bewitched
by a high german doctor during the
early days of the settlement others
that an old indian chief the prophet
or wizard of his tribe held his pow-
wows there before the country was
discovered by master hendrick hud-
son certain it is the place still con-


weird tales

tinues under the sway of some witch-
ing power that holds a spell over the
minds of the good people causing
hem to walk in a continual revery
they are given to all kinds of mar-
velous beliefs are subject to trances
and visions and frequently see
strange sights and hear music and
voices in the air the whole neigh-
borhood abounds with local tales
haunted spots and twilight supersti-
tions stars shoot and meteors glare
oftener across the valley than in any
other part of the country and the
nightmare with her whole ninefold
seems to make it the favorite scene of
her gambols

  the dominant spirit however that
haunts this enchanted region and
seems to be commandor-in-chief of all
the powers of the air is the appari-
tion of a figure on horseback without
a head it is said by some to be the
ghost of a hessian trooper whose
head had been carried away by a
cannon-ball in some nameless battle
during the revolutionary war and
who is ever and anon seen by the
country folk hurrying along in the
gloom of night as if on the wings of
the wind his haunts are not con-
fined to the valley but extend at
times to the adjacent roads and
especially to the vicinity of a church
at no great distance indeed certain
of the most authentic historians of
these parts who have been careful in
collecting and collating the floating
facts concerning this specter allege
that the body of the trooper having
been buried in the churchyard the
ghost rides forth to the scene of battle
in nightly quest of his head and that
the rushing speed with which he some-
times passes along the hollow like a
midnight blast is owing to his being
belated and in a hurry to get back to
the churchyard before daybreak

  such is tjie general purport of this
legendary superstition which has fur-
nished materials for many a wild
story in that region of shadows and
the specter is known at all the

coiuitry firesides by the name of the
headless horseman of sleepy hollow

  it is remarkable that the visionary
propensity i have mentioned is not
confined to the native inhabitants of
the valley but is unconsciously im-
bibed by everyone who resides there
for a time however wide awake
they may have been before they en-
tered that sleepy region they are
sure in a little time to inhale the
witching influence of the air and be-
gin to grow imaginative-to dream
dreams and see apparitions

  i mention this peaceful spot with
all possible laud for it is in such little
retired dutch valleys found here and
there embosomed in the great state
of new york that population man-
ners and customs remain fixed while
the great torrent of migration and im-
provement which is making such in-
cessant changes in other parts of this
restless country sweeps by them un-
observed they are like those little
nooks of still water which border a
rapid stream where we may see the
straw and bubble riding quietly at
anchor or slowly revolving in their
mimic harbor undisturbed by the
rush of the passing current though
many years have elapsed since i trod
the drowsy shades of sleepy hollow
yet i question whether i should not
still find the same trees and the same
families vegetating in its sheltered
bosom

in this by-place of nature there
abode in a remote period of ameri-
can history that is to say some
thirty years since a worthy wight of
the name of ichabod crane who so-
journed or as he expressed it tar-
ried   in sleepy hollow for the pur-
pose of instructing the children of the
vicinity he was a native of con-
necticut a state which supplies the
union with pioneers for the mind as
well as for the forest and sends forth
yearly its legions of frontier woods-
men and country schoolmasters the
cognomen of crane was not inap-
the legend of sleepy hollow



plicable to his person he was tali
but exceedingly lank with narrow
shoulders long arms and legs hands
that dangled a mile out of his sleeves
feet that might have served for
shovels and his whole frame most
loosely hung together his head was
small and flat at top with huge eais
large green glassy eyes and a long
snipe nose so that it looked like a
weathercock perched upon his
spindle neck to tell which way the
wind blew to see him striding along
the profile of a hill on a windy day
with his clothes bagging and flutter-
ing about him one might have mis-
taken him for the genius of famine
descending upon the earth or some
scarecrow eloped from a cornfield

  his schoolhouse was a low building
of one large rom rudely constructed
of logs the windows partly glazed
and partly patched with leaves of old
copy-books it was most ingeniously
secured at vacant hours by a withe
twisted in the handle of the door and
stakes set against the window shut-
ters  so that though a thief might get
in with perfect ease he would find
some embarrassment in getting out
an idea most probably borrowed by
the architect yost van houten from
the mystery of an eel-pot the school-
house stood in a rather lonely but
pleasant situation just at the foot of
a woody hill with a brook running
close by and a formidable birch tree
growing at one end of it from hence
the low murmur of his pupils voices
conning over their lessons might be
heard in a drowsy summers day like
the hum of a beehive interrupted
now and then by the authoritative
voice of the master in the tone of
menace or command or peradven-
ture by the appalling sound of the
birch as he urged some tardy loiterer
along the flowery path of knowledge
truth to say he was a conscientious
man and ever bore in mind the gold-
en maxim spare the rod and spoil
the child - iehabod cranes schol-
ars certainly were not spoiled

  i would not have it imagined how-
ever that he was one of those cruel
potentates of the school who joy in
the smart of their subjects on the
contrary he administered justice with
discrimination rather than severity
taking the burthen off the backs of the
weak and laying it on those of the
strong your mere puny stripling
that winced at the least flourish of the
rod was passed by with indulgence
but the claims of justice were satis-
fied by inflicting a double portion on
some little tough wrong-headed
broad-skirted dutch urchin who 
sulked and swelled and grew dogged
and sullen beneath the birch all this
he called doing his duty by their
parents and he never inflicted a
chastisement without following it by
the assurance so consolatory to the
smarting urchin that he would re-
member it and thank him for it the
longest day he had to live  

  when school hours were over he
was even the companion and play-
mate of the larger boys and on holi-
day afternoons would convoy some of
the smaller ones home who happened
to have pretty sisters or good house-
wives for mothers noted for the com-
forts of the cupboard indeed it be-
hooved him to keep on good terms
with his pupils the revenue arising
from his school was small and would
have been scarcely sufficient to fur-
nish him with daily bread for he was
a huge feeder and though lank had
the dilating powers of an anaconda
but to help out his maintenance he
was according to country custom in
those parts boarded and lodged at
the houses of the farmers whose chil-
dren he instructed with these he
lived successively a week at a time
thus going the rounds of the neighbor-
hood with all his worldly effects tied
up in a cotton handkerchief

  that all this might not be too oner-
ous on the purses of his rustic patrons
who are apt to consider the costs of
schooling a grievous burden and
schoolmasters as mere drones he had


weird tales

various ways of rendering himself
both useful and agreeable he assist-
ed the farmers occasionally in the
lighter labors of their farms helped
to make hay mended the fences took
the horses to water drove the cows
from pasture and cut wood for the
winter fire he laid aside too all the
dominant dignity and absolute sway
with which he lorded it in his little
empire the school and became won-
derfully gentle and ingratiating he
found favor in the eyes of the moth-
ers by petting the children particu-
larly the youngest and like the lion
bold which whilom so magnanimously
the lamb did hold he would sit with
a child on one knee and rock a cradle
with his foot for whole hours together

  in addition to his other vocations
he was the singing-master of the
neighborhood and picked up many
bright shillings by instructing the
young folks in psalmody it was a
matter of no little vanity to him on
sundays to take his station in front
of the church gallery with a band of
chosen singers where in his own
mind he completely carried away the
palm from the parson certain it is
his voice resounded far above all the
rest of the congregation and there
are peculiar quavers still to be heard
in that church and which may even
be heard half a mile off quite to the
opposite side of the mill-pond on a
still sunday morning which are said
to be legitimately descended from the
nose of ichabod crane thus by
divers little makeshifts in that in-
genious way which is commonly de-
nominated by hook and by crook
the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably
enough and was thought by all who
understood nothing of the labor of
headwork to have a wonderfully easy
life of it

  the schoolmaster is generally a man
of some importance in the female
circle of a rural neighborhood being
considered a kind of idle gentleman-
like personage of vastly superior taste
and accomplishments to the rough

country swains and indeed inferior
in learning only to the parson his
appearance therefore is apt to oc-
casion some little stir at the tea-table
of a farmhouse and the addition of a
supernumerary dish of cakes or
sweetmeats or peradventure the pa-
rade of a silver teapot our man of
letters therefore was peculiarly
happy in the smiles of all the country
damsels how he would figure among
them in the churchyard between ser-
vices on sundays gathering grapes
for them from the wild vines that
overran the surrounding trees recit-
ing for their amusement all the epi-
taphs on the tombstones or saunter-
ing with a whole bevy of them along
the banks of the adjacent mill-pond
while the more bashfulcountry bump-
kins hung sheepishly back envying
his superior elegance and address

  from his half itinerant life also he
was a kind of traveling gazette car-
rying the whole budget of local gossip
from house to house so that his ap-
pearance was always greeted with sat-
isfaction he was moreover es-
teemed by the women as a man of
great erudition for he had read sev-
eral books quite through and was a
perfect master of cotton mathers
history of new england witchcraft
in which by the way he most firmly
and potently believed

  he was in fact an odd mixture of
small shrewdness and simple credu-
lity his appetite for the marvelous
and his powers of digesting it were
equally extraordinary and both had
been increased by his residence in this
spellbound region no tale was too
gross or monstrous for his capacious
swallow it was often his delight
after his school was dismissed in the
afternoon to stretch himself on the
rich bed of clover bordering the little
brook that whimpered by his school-
house and there con over old
mathers direful tales until the gath-
ering dusk of the evening made the
printed page a mere mist before his
eyes then as he wended his way
the legend of sleepy hollow



by swamp and stream and awful
woodland to the farmhouse where he
happened to be quartered every
sound of nature at that witching
hour fluttered his excited imagina-
tion the moan of the whippoorwill
from the hill-side the boding cry of
the tree-toad that harbinger of storm
the dreary hooting of the screech-owl
or the sudden rustling in the thicket
of birds frightened from their roost
the fireflies too which sparkled most
vividly in the darkest places now and
then startled him as one of uncom-
mon brightness would stream across
his path and if by chance a huge
blockhead of a beetle came winging
his blundering flight against him the
poor varlet was ready to give up the
ghost with the idea that he was struck
with a witchs token his only re-
source on such occasions either to
drown thought or drive away evil
spirits was to sing psalm tunes-and
the good people of sleepy hollow as
they sat by their doors of an evening
were often filled with awe at hearing
his nasal melody in linked sweet-
ness long drawn out floating from
the distant hill or along the dusky
road

  another of his sources of fearful
pleasure was to pass long winter
evenings with the old dutch wives as
they sat spinning by the fire with
a row of apples roasting and splutter-
ing along the hearth and listen to
their marvelous tales of ghosts and
goblins and haunted fields and
haunted brooks and haunted bridges
and haunted houses and particularly
of the headless horseman or galloping
hessian of the hollow as they some-
times called him he would delight
them equally by his anecdotes of
witchcraft and of the direful omens
and portentous sights and sounds in
the air which prevailed in the earlier
times of connecticut and would
frighten them wofully with specula-
tions upon comets and shooting stars
and with the alarming fact that the
world did absolutely turn round and

that they were half the time topsy-
turvy 

  but if there was a pleasure in all
this while snugly cuddling in the
chimney corner of a chamber that was
all of a ruddy glow from the crackling
wood fire and where of course no
specter dared to show his face it was
dearly purchased by the terrors of his
subsequent walk homewards what
fearful shapes and shadows beset his
path amidst the dim and ghastly glare
of a snowy night-with what wistful
look did he eye even trembling ray
of light streaming across the waste
fields from some distant window-
how often was he appalled by some
shrub covered with snow which like
a sheeted specter beset his very
path -how often did he shrink with
curdling awe at the sound of his own
steps on the frosty crust beneath his
feet and dread to look over his
shoulder lest he should behold some
uncouth being tramping close behind
him-and how often was he thrown
into complete dismay by some rushing
blast howling among the trees in the
idea that it was the galloping hessian
on one of his nightly scourings

  all these however were mere ter-
rors of the night phantoms of the
mind that walk in darkness and
though he had seen many specters in
his time and been more than once
beset by satan in divers shapes in his
lonely perambulations yet daylight
put an end to all these evils and he
would have passed a pleasant life of
it in despite of the devil and all his
works if his path had not been crossed
by a being that causes more per-
plexity to mortal man than ghosts
goblins and the whole race of witches
put together and that was-a woman

 mong the musical disciples who
assembled one evening in each
week to receive his instructions in
psalmody was katrina van tassel
the daughter and only child of a sub-
stantial dutch farmer she was a
blooming lass of fresh eighteen

plump as a partridge ripe and melt-
ing and rosy-cheeked as one of her
fathers peaches and universally
famed not merely for her beauty but
her vast expectations she was withal
a little of a coquette as might be per-
ceived even in her dress which was a
mixture of ancient and modem
fashions as most suited to set off her
charms she wore the ornaments of
pure yellow gold which her great-
great-grandmother had brought over
from saardam the tempting stom-
acher of the olden time and withal a
provokingly short petticoat to dis-
play the piettiest foot and ankle in
the country round

  iehabod crane had a soft and fool-
ish heart towards the sex and it is
not to be wondered at that so tempt-
ing a morsel soon found favor in his
eyes more especially after he had
visited her in her paternal mansion
old baltus van tassel was a perfect
picture of a thriving contented lib-
eral-hearted farmer he seldom it is
true sent either his eyes or his
thoughts beyond the boundaries of his
own farm but within those every-
thing was snug happy and well-con-
ditioned he was satisfied with his
wealth but not proud of it and
piqued himself upon the hearty
abundance rather than the style in
which he lived his stronghold was
situated on the banks of the hudson
in one of those green sheltered fer-
tile nooks in which the dutch farm-
ers are so fond of nestling a great
elm-tree spread its broad branches
over it at the foot of which bubbled
up a spring of the softest and sweet-
est water in a little well formed of a
barrel and then stole sparkling away
through the grass to a neighboring
brook that bubbled along among
alders and dwarf willows hard by
the farmhouse was a vast bam that
might have served for a church every
window and crevice of which seemed
bursting forth with the treasures of
the farm the flail was busily resound-
ing within it from morning to night

swallows and martins skimmed twit-
tering about the eaves and rows of
pigeons some with one eye turned
up as if watching the weather some
with their heads under their wings or
buried in their bosoms and others
swelling and cooing and bowing
about their dames were enjoying the
sunshine on the roof sleek unwieldy
porkers were grunting in the repose
and abundance of their pens whence
sallied forth now and then troops of
sucking pigs as if to snuff the air
a stately squadron of snowy geese
were riding in an adjoining pond
convoying whole fleets of ducks regi-
ments of turkeys were gobbling
through the farmyard and guinea-
fowls fretting about it like ill-tem-
pered housewives with their peevish
discontented cry before the barn
door strutted the gallant cock that
pattern of a husband a warrior and
a fine gentleman clapping his bur-
nished wings and crowing in the
pride and gladness of his heart-
sometimes tearing up the eartli with
his feet and then generously calling
his ever-hungry family of wives and
children to enjoy the rich morsel
which he had discovered

  the pedagogues mouth watered
as he looked upon this sumptuous
promise of luxurious winter fare in
his devouring minds eye he pictured
to himself every roasting-pig running
about with a pudding in his belly and
an apple in his mouth the pigeons
were snugly put to bed in a com-
fortable pie and tucked in with a
coverlet of crust the geese were
swimming in their own gravy and the
ducks pairing cosily in dishes like
snug married couples with a decent
competency of onion sauce in the
porkers he saw carved out the future
sleek side of bacon and juicy relish-
ing ham not a turkey but he beheld
daintily trussed up with its gizzard
under its wing and peradventure a
necklace of savory sausages and even
bright chanticleer himself lay sprawl-
ing on his back in a side-dish with
the legend of sleepy hollow



uplifted claws as if craving that
quarter which his chivalrous spirit
disdained to ask while living

  as the enraptured ichabod fancied
all this and as he rolled his great
green eyes over the fat meadow-lands
the rich fields of wheat of rye of
buckwheat and indian com and the
orchards burthened with ruddy fruit
which surrounded the warm tenement
of van tassel his heart yearned after
the damsel who was to inherit these
domains and his imagination expand-
ed with the idea how they might be
readily turned into cash and the
money invested in immense tracts of
wild land and shingle palaces in the
wilderness nay his busy fancy al-
ready realized his hopes and present-
ed to him the blooming katrina with
a whole family of children mounted
on the top of a wagon loaded with
household trumpery with pots and
kettles dangling beneath and he be-
held himself bestriding a pacing mare
with a colt at her heels setting out
for kentucky tennessee or the lord
knows where

  when he entered the house the con-
quest of his heart was complete it
was one of those spacious farmhouses
with high-ridged but lowly sloping
roofs built in the style handed down
from the first dutch settlers the low
projecting eaves forming a piazza
along the front capable of being
closed up in bad weather under this
were hung flails harness various
utensils of husbandry and nets for
fishing in the neighboring river
benches were built along the sides for
summer use and a great spinning-
wheel at one end and a chum at the
other showed the various uses to
which this important porch might be
devoted from this piazza the won-
dering ichabod entered the hall
which formed the center of the man-
sion and the place of usual residence
here rows of resplendent pewter
ranged on a long dresser dazzled his
eyes in one comer stood a huge bag

of wool ready to be spun in another
a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from
the loom ears of indian com and
strings of dried apples and peaches
hung in gay festoons along the walls
mingled with the gaud of red pep-
pers  and a door left ajar gave him a
peep into the best parlor where the
claw-footed chairs and dark mahog-
any tables shone like mirrors and-
irons with their accompanying shovel
and tongs glistened from their cov-
ert of asparagus tops mock-oranges
and conch-sheils decorated the mantel-
piece  strings of various colored birds
eggs were suspended above it a great
ostrich egg was hung from the center
of the room and a comer cupboard
knowingly left open displayed im-
mense treasures of old silver and well-
mended china

  from the moment ichabod laid his
eyes upon these regions of delight the
peace of his mind was at an end and
his only study was how to gain the
affections of the peerless daughter of
van tassel in this enterprise how-
ever he had more real difficulties than
generally fell to the lot of a knight-
errant of yore who seldom had any
thing but giants enchanters fiery
dragons and such like easily con-
quered adversaries to contend with
and had to make his way meielv
through gates of iron and brass and
walls of adamant to the castle keep
where the lady of his heart was con-
fined all which he achieved as easily
as a man would carve his way to the
center of a christmas pie and then
the lady gave him her hand as a mat-
ter of course ichabod on the con-
trary had to win his way to the heart
of a country coquette beset with a
labyrinth of whims and caprices
which were for ever presenting new
difficulties and impediments and he
had to encounter a host of fearful
adversaries of real flesh and blood
the numerous rustic admirers who be-
set every portal to her heart keeping
a watchful and angry eye upon each

other but ready to fly out in the com-
mon cause against any new com-

 	among these the most formidable
was a burly roaring roystering blade
of the name of abraham or accord-
ing to the dutch abbreviation brom
van brunt the hero of the country
round which rang with his feats of
strength and hardihood he was
broad-shouldered and double-jointed
with short curly black hair and a
bluff but not unpleasant countenance
having a mingled air of fun and ar-
roganee from his herculean frame
and great powers of limb he received
the nickname of brom bones by
which he was universally known he
was famed for great knowledge and
skill in horsemanship being as dex-
terous on horseback as a tartar he
was foremost at all races and cock-
fights and with the ascendancy
which bodily strength acquires in
rustic life was the umpire in all dis-
putes setting his hat on one side and
giving his decisions with an air and
tone admitting of no gainsay or ap-
peal he was always ready for either
a fight or a frolic but had more mis-
chief than ill-will in his composition
and with all his overbearing rough-
ness there was a strong dash of wag-
gish good humor at bottom he had
three or four boon companions who
regarded him as their model and at
the head of whom he scoured the
country attending every scene of
feud or merriment for miles round
in cold weather he was distinguished
by a fur cap surmounted with a
flaunting foxs tail and when the
folks at a country gathering descried
this well-known crest at a distance
whisking about among a squad of
hard riders they always stood by for
a squall sometimes his crew would
be heard dashing along past the farm-
houses at midnight with whoop and
halloo like a troop of don cossacks
and the old dames startled out of
their sleep would listen for a moment
till the hurry-scurry had clattered by

and then exclaim ay there goes
brom bones and his gang the
neighbors looked upon him with a
mixture of awe admiration and good
will and when any madcap prank or
rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity
always shook their heads and war-
ranted brom bones was at the bottom
of it

  this rantipole hero had for some
time singled out the blooming katrina
for the object of his uncouth gallan-
tries and though his amorous toyings
were something like the gentle caress-
es and endearments of a bear yet it
was whispered that she did not alto-
gether discourage his hopes certain
it is his advances were signals for
rival candidates to retire who felt no
inclination to cross a lion in his
amours insomuch that when his
horse was seen tied to van tassels
paling on a sunday night a sure sign
that his master was courting or as it
is termed sparking within all
other suitors passed by in despair and
carried the war into other quarters

  such was the formidable rival with
whom ichabod crane had to contend
and considering all things a stouter
man than he would have shrunk from
the competition and a wiser man
would have despaired he had how-
ever a happy mixture of pliability
and perseverance in his nature he
was in form and spirit like a supple-
jack-yielding but tough though he
bent he never broke and though he
bowed beneath the slightest pressure
yet the moment it was away-jerk
he was as erect and carried his head
as high as ever

  to have taken the field openly
against his rival would have been
madness for he was not a man to be
thwarted in his amours any more
than that stormy lover achilles
ichabod therefore made his advances
in a quiet and gently insinuating
manner under cover of his charac-
ter of singing-master he made fre-
quent visits at the farmhouse not
that he had anything to apprehend

from the meddlesome interference of
parents which is so often a stumbling-
block in the path of lovers balt van
tassel was an easy indulgent soul he
loved his daughter better even than
his pipe and like a reasonable man
and an excellent father let her have
her way in everything his notable
little wife too had enough to do to
attend to her housekeeping and man-
age her poultry for as she sagely
observed ducks and geese are foolish
things and must be looked after but
girls can take care of themselves
thus while the busy dame bustled
about the house or plied her spinning-
wheel at one end of the piazza honest
balt would sit smoking his evening
pipe at the other watching the
achievements of a little wooden war-
rior who armed with a sword in each
hand was most valiantly fighting the
wind on the pinnacle of the barn in
the meantime ichabod would carry
on his suit with the daughter by the
side of the spring under the great elm

 profess not to know how womens
hearts are wooed and won to me
they have always been matters of rid-
dle and admiration some seem to
have but one vulnerable points or door
of access while others have a thou-

in a thousand different ways it is a
great triumph of skill to gain the
former but a still greater proof of
generalship to maintain possession of
the latter for the man must battle for
his fortress at every door and win-
dow he who wins a thousand com-
mon hearts is therefore entitled to
some renown but he who keeps un-
disputed sway over the heart of a
coquette is indeed a hero certain
it is this was not the case with the
redoubtable brom bones and from
the moment ichabod crane made his
advances the interests of the former
evidently declined his horse was no

longer seen tied at the palings on sun-
day nights and a deadly feud gradu-
ally arose between him and the pre-
ceptor of sleepy hollow

  brom who had a degree of rough
chivalry in his nature would fain
have carried matters to open warfare
and have settled their pretensions to
the lady according to the mode of
those most concise and simple reason-
ers the knights-errant of yore-by
single combat but ichabod was too
conscious of the superior might of his
adversary to enter the lists against
him he had overheard a boast of
bones that he would double the
schoolmaster up and lay him on a
shelf of his own schoolhouse  and
he was too wary to give him an op-
portunity there was something
extremely provoking in this obstinate-
ly pacific system it left brom no
alternative but to draw upon the
funds of rustic waggery in his dis-
position and to play off boorish prac-
tical jokes upon his rival ichabod
became the object of whimsical perse-
cution to bones and his gang of
rough riders they harried his
hitherto peaceful domains smoked
out his singing-school by stopping up
the chimney broke into the school-
house at night in spite of its formi-
dable fastenings of withe and window-
stakes and turned everything topsy-
turvy so that the poor schoolmaster
began to think all the witches in the
country held their meetings there
but what was still more annoying
brom took all opportunities of turn-
ing him into ridicule in presence of
his mistress and had a scoundrel dog
whom he taught to whine in the most
ludicrous manner and introduced as
a rival of ichabods to instruct her in
psalmody

  in this way matters went on for
some time without producing any ma-
terial effect on the relative situation
of the contending powers on a fine
autumnal afternoon ichabod in pen-
sive mood sat enthroned on the lofty
stool whence he usually watched ail

the concerns of his little literary
realm in his hand he swayed a
ferule that scepter of despotic power
the birch of justice reposed on three
nails behind the throne a constant
terror to evil-doers while on the desk
before him might be seen sundry con-
traband articles and prohibited weap-
ons detected upon the persons of idle
urchins such as half munched apples
popguns whirligigs fly-cages and
whole legions of rampant little paper
game-cocks apparently there had
been some appalling act of justice re-
cently inflicted for his scholars were
all busily intent upon their books or
slyly whispering behind them with
one eye kept upon the master and a
kind of buzzing stillness reigned
throughout the schoolroom it was
suddenly interrupted by the appear-
ance of a negro in tow-eloth jacket
and trousers a round-crowned frag-
ment of a hat like the cap of mer-
cury and mounted on the back of a
ragged wild half-broken colt which
he managed with a rope by way of
halter i-ic came clattering up to the
school door with an invitation to icha-
bod to attend a merrymaking or
quilting frolic to be held that
evening at mynheer van tassels
and having delivered his message with
that air of importance and effort at
fine language which a negro is apt to
display on petty embassies of the kind
he dashed over the brook and was
seen scampering away up the hollow
full of the importance and hurry of
his mission

  all was now bustle and hubbub in
the late quiet schoolroom the schol-
ars were hurried through their les-
sons without stopping at trifles those
who were nimble skipped over half
with impunity and those who were
tardy had a smart application now
and then in the rear to quicken their
speed or help them over a tall word
books were flung aside without being
put away on the shelves inkstands
were overturned benches thrown
down and the whole school was

turned loose an hour before the usual
time bursting forth like a legion of
young imps yelping and racketing
about the green in joy at their early
emancipation

  the gallant ichabod now spent at
least an extra half-hour at his toilet
brushing and furbishing up his best
and indeed only suit of rusty black
and arranging his looks by a bit of
broken looking-glass that hung up in
the schoolhouse that he might make
his appearance before his mistress in
the true style of a cavalier he bor-
rowed a horse from the farmer with
whom he was domiciliated a choleric
old dutchman of the name of hans
van ripper and thus gallantly
mounted issued forth like a knight-
errant in quest of adventures but it
is meet i should in the true spirit of
romantic story give some account of
the looks and equipments of my hero
and his steed the animal he bestrode
was a broken-down plowhorse that
had outlived almost everything but
his viciousness he was gaunt and
shagged with a ewe neck and a head
like a hammer his rusty mane and
tail were tangled and knotted with
burrs one eye had lost its pupil and
was glaring and spectral but the
other had the gleam of a genuine
devil in it still he must have had
fire and mettle in his day if we may
judge from the name he bore of gun-
powder he had in fact been a fa-
vorite steed of his masters the
choleric van ripper who was a fu-
rious rider and had infused very
probably some of his own spirit into
the animal for old and broken-down
as he looked there was more of the
lurking devil in him than in any
young filly in the country

  ichabod was a suitable figure for
such a steed he rode with short stir-
rups which brought hisknees nearly
up to the pommel of the saddle his
sharp elbows stuck out like grass-
hoppers he carried his whip per-
pendicularly in his hand like a
scepter and as his horse jogged on
the legend of sleepy hollow



the motion of his arms was not unlike
the flapping of a pair of wings a
small wool hat rested on the top of
his nose for so his scanty strip of
forehead might be called and the
skirts of his black coat fluttered out
almost to the horses tail such was
the appearance of ichabod and his
steed as they shambled out of the
gate of hans van ripper and it was
altogether such an apparition as is
seldom to be met with in broad day-
light

  it was as i have said a fine au-
tumnal day the sky was clear and
serene and nature wore that rich and
golden livery which we always associ-
ate with the idea of abundance the
forests had put on their sober brown
and yellow while some trees of the
tenderer kind had been nipped by the
frosts into brilliant dyes of orange
purple and scarlet streaming files
of wild ducks began to make their ap-
pearance high in the air the bark of
the squirrel might be heard from the
groves of beech and hickory nuts and
the pensive whistle of the quail at in-
tervals from the neighboring stubble-
field

  the small birds were taking their
farewell banquets in the fulness of
their revelry they fluttered cliiiping
and frolicking from bush to bush and
tree to tree capricious from the very
profusion and variety around them
there was the honest eoek-robin the
favorite game of stripling sportsmen
with its lond querulous note and the
twittering blackbirds flying in sable
clouds and the golden-winged wood-
pecker with his crimson crest his
broad black gorget and splendid
plumage and the cedar bird with its
red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail
and its little monteiio cap of feathers
pid the blue-jay that noisy coxcomb
in his gay light-blue coat and white
underclothes screaming and chatter-
ing nodding and bobbing and bowing
and pretending to be on good terms
with even- songster of the grove

  as ichabod jogged slowly on his

way his eye ever open to every symp-
tom of culinary abundance ranged
with delight over the treasures of jolly
autumn on all sides he beheld vast
store of apples some hanging in op-
pressive opulence on the trees some
gathered into baskets and barrels for
the market others heaped up in rich
piles for the cider-press farther on
he beheld great fields of indian corn
with its golden ears peeping from
their leafy coverts and holding out
the promise of cakes and hasty pud-
ding and the yellow pumpkins lying
beneath them turning up their fair
round bellies to the sun and giving
ample prospects of the most luxurious
of pies and anon he passed the fra-
grant buckwheat fields breathing the
odor of the beehive and as he beheld
them soft anticipations stole over his
mind of dainty flapjacks well but-
tered and garnished with honey or
treacle by the delicate little dimpled
hand of katrina van tassel

  thus feeding his mind with many
sweet thoughts and sugared sup-
positions he journeyed along the
sides of a range of hills which look
out upon some of the goodliest scenes
of the mighty hudson the sun gradu-
ally wheeled his broad disk down
into the west the wide bosom of the
tappan zee lay motionless and glassy
excepting that here and there a gentle
undulation waved and prolonged the
blue shadow of the distant mountain
a few amber clouds floated in the
sky without a breath of air to move
them the horizon was of a fine gold-
en tint changing gradually into a
pure apple green and from that into
the deep blue of the mid-heaven a
slanting ray lingered on the woody
crests of the precipices that overhung
some parts of the river giving great-
er depth to the dark-grav and purple
of their rocky sides a sloop was
loitering in the distance dropping
slowly down with the tide her sail
hanging uselessly against the mast
and as the reflection of the sky
gleamed along the still water it


weird tales

seemed as if the vessel was suspended
in the air

it was toward evening that ichabod
arrived at the castle of the heer
van tassel which he found thronged
with the pride and flower of the ad-
jacent country old farmers a spare
leathern-faced race in homespun
coats and breeches blue stockings
huge shoes and magnificent pewter
buckles their brisk withered little
dames in close crimped caps long-
waisted short-gowns homespun petti-
coats with scissors and pincushions
and gay calico pockets hanging on the
outside buxom lasses almost as an-
tiquated as their mothers excepting
where a straw hat a fine ribbon or
perhaps a white frock gave symptoms
of city innovation the sons in short
square-skirted coats with rows of
stupendous brass buttons and their
hair generally queued in the fashion
of the times especially if they could
procure an eel-skin for the purpose
it being esteemed throughout the
country as a potent nourisher and
strengthener of the hair

  brom bones however was the hero
of the scene having come to the
gathering on his favorite steed dare-
devil a creature like himself full of
mettle and mischief and which no
one but himself could manage he
was in fact noted for preferring
vicious animals given to all kinds of
tricks which kept the rider in con-
stant risk of his neck for he held a
tractable well-broken horse as un-
worthy of a lad of spirit

  fain would i pause to dwell upon
the world of charms that burst upon
the enraptured gaze of my hero as
he entered the state parlor of van
tassels mansion not those of the
bevy of buxom lasses with their
luxurious display of red and white
but the ample charms of a genuine
dutch country tea-table in the sump-
tuous time of autumn such heaped-
up platters of cakes of various and
almost indescribable kinds known

only to experienced dutch house-
wives  there was the doughty dough-
nut the tenderer olykoek and the
crisp and crumbling cruller sweet
cakes and short cakes ginger cakes
and honey cakes and the whole
family of cakes and then there were
apple pies and peach pies and pump-
kin pies besides slices of ham and
smoked beef and moreover delectable
dishes of preserved plums and
peaches and pears and quinces not
to mention broiled shad and roasted
chickens together with bowls of milk
and cream all mingled higgledy-
piggledy pretty much as i have
enumerated them with the motherly
teapot sending up its clouds of vapor
from the midst-heaven bless the
mark i want breath and time to dis-
cuss this banquet as it deserves and
am too eager to get on with my story
happily ichabod crane was not in so
great a hurry as his historian but did
ample justice to every dainty

  he was a kind and thankful crea-
ture whose heart dilated in propor-
tion as his skin was filled with good
cheer and whose spirits rose with
eating as some mens do with drink
he could not help too rolling his
large eyes round him as he ate and
chuckling with the possibility that he
might one day be lord of all this scene
of almost unimaginable luxury and
splendor then he thought how soon
hed turn his back upon the old
schoolhouse snap his fingers in the
face of hans van ripper and every
other niggardly patron and kick any
itinerant pedagogue out of doors that
should dare to call him comrade

  old baltus van tassel moved about
among his guests with a face dilated
with content and good humor round
and jolly as the harvest moon his
hospitable attentions were brief but
expressive being confined to a shake
of the hand a slap on the shoulder a
loud laugh and a pressing invitation
to fall to and help themselves

  and now the sound of the music
from the common room or hall sum-
the legend of sleepy hollow



moned to the dance the musician
was an old gray-headed negro who
had been the itinerant orchestra of
the neighborhood for more than half
a century his instrument was as old
and battered as himself the greater
part of the time he scraped on two or
three strings accompanying every
movement of the bow with a motion
of the head bowing almost to the
ground and stamping with his foot
whenever a fresh couple were to start

  ichabod prided himself upon his
dancing as much as upon his vocal
powers not a limb not a fiber about
him was idle and to have seen his
loosely hung frame in full motion and
clattering about the room you would
have thought saint vitus himself
that blessed patron of the dance was
figuring before you in person he
was the admiration of all the negroes
who having gathered of all ages and
sizes from the farm and the neighbor-
hood stood forming a pyramid of
shining black faces at every door and
window gazing with delight at the
scene rolling their white eyeballs
and showing grinning rows of ivory
from ear to ear how could the flog-
ger of urchins be otherwise than ani-
mated and joyous the lady of his
heart was his partner in the dance
and smiling graciously in reply to all
his amorous oglings while brom
bones sorely smitten with love and
jealousy sat brooding by himself in
one corner

  when the dance was at an end
ichabod was attracted to a knot of
the sager folks who with old van
tassel sat smoking at one end of the
piazza gossiping over former times
and drawing out long stories about
the war

  this neighborhood at the time of
which i am speaking was one of those
highly favored places which abound
with chronicle and great men the
british and american line had run
near it during the war it had there-
fore been the scene of marauding and
infested with refugees cowboys and

all kinds of border chivalry just suf-
ficient time had elapsed to enable each
story-teller to dress up his tale with a
little becoming fiction and in the in-
distinctness of his recollection to
make himself the hero of every ex-
ploit

  there was the story of doffue mart-
ling a large blue-bearded dutchman
who had nearly taken a british
frigate with an old iron nine-pounder
from a mud breastwork only that his
gun burst at the sixth discharge and
there was an old gentleman who shall
be nameless being too rich a mynheer
to be lightly mentioned who in the
battle of white plains being an excel-
lent master of defense parried a
musket ball with a small sword inso-
much that he absolutely felt it whiz
round the blade and glance off at the
hilt in proof of which he was ready
at any time to show the sword with
the hilt a little bent there were sev-
eral more that had been equally great
in the field not one of whom but was
persuaded that he had a considerable
hand in bringing the war to a happy
termination

  but all these were nothing to the
tales of ghosts and apparitions that
succeeded the neighborhood is rich
in legendary treasures of the kind
local tales and superstitions thrive
best in these sheltered long-settled re-
treats but are trampled under foot
by the shifting throng that forms the
population of most of our country
places besides there is no encourage-
ment for ghosts in most of our vil-
lages for they have scarcely had time
to finish their first nap and turn
themselves in their graves before
their surviving friends have traveled
away from the neighborhood so that
when they turn out at night to walk
their rounds they have no acquaint-
ance left to call upon this is per-
haps the reason why we so seldom hear
of ghosts except in our long-estab-
lished dutch communities

  the immediate cause however of
the prevalence of supernatural stories


weird tales

in these parts was doubtless owing to
the vicinity of sleepy hollow there
was a contagion in the very air that
blew from that haunted region it
breathed forth an atmosphere of
dreams and fancies infecting all the
land several of the sleepy hollow
people were present at van tassels
and as usual were doling out their
wild and wonderful legends many
dismal tales were told about funeral
trains and mourning cries and wail-
ings heard and seen about the great
tree where the unfortunate major
andre was taken and which stood in
the neighborhood some mention was
made also of the woman in white that
haunted the dark glen at raven rock
and was often heard to shriek on win-
ter nights before a storm having
perished there in the snow the chief
part of the stories however turned
upon the favorite specter of sleepy
hollow the headless horseman who
had been heard several times of late
patrolling the country and it was
said tethered his horse nightly among
the graves in the churchyard

  the sequestered situation of this
church seems always to have made it
a favorite haunt of troubled spirits
it stands on a knoll surrounded by
locust-trees and lofty elms from
among which its decent whitewashed
walls shine modestly forth like chris-
tian purity beaming through the
shades of retirement a gentle slope
descends from it to a silver sheet of
water bordered by high trees between
which peeps may be caught at the
blue hills of the hudson to look
upon its grass-grown yard where the
sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly one
would think that there at least the
dead might rest in peace on one side
of the church extends a wide woody
dell along which raves a large brook
among broken rocks and trunks of
fallen trees over a deep black part
of the stream not far from the
church was formerly thrown a wood-
en bridge the road that led to it and
the bridge itself were thickly shaded

by overhanging trees which cast a
gloom about it even in the daytime
but occasioned a fearful darkness at
night this was one of the favorite
haunts of the headless horseman and
the place where he was most frequent-
ly encountered the tale was told of
old brouwer a most heretical disbe-
liever in ghosts how he met the horse-
man returning from his foray into
sleepy hollow and was obliged to
get up behind him how they galloped
over bush and brake over liill and
swamp until they reached the bridge
when the horseman suddenly turned
into a skeleton threw old brouwer
into the brook and sprang away over
the tree-tops with a clap of thunder

 this story was immediately
matched by a thrice marvelous adven-
ture of brom bones who made light
of the galloping hessian as an arrant
jockey he affirmed that on return-
ing one night from the neighboring
village of sing sing he had been
overtaken by this midnight trooper
that he had offered to race with him
for a bowl of punch and should have
won it too for daredevil beat the
goblin horse all hollow but just as
they came to the church bridge the
hessian bolted and vanished in a
flash of fire

  all these tales told in that drowsy
undertone with which men talk in the
dark the countenances of the listen-
ers only now and then receiving a
casual gleam from the glare of a pipe
sank deep in the mind of ichabod
he repaid them in kind with large
extracts from his invaluable author
cotton mather and added many mar-
velous events that had taken place in
his native state of connecticut and
fearful sights which he had seen in
his nightly walks about sleepy hol-
low

the revel now gradually broke up
the old farmers gathered together
their families in their wagons and
were heard for some time rattling
along the hollow roads and over the
the legend of sleepy hollow



distant hills some of the damsels
mounted on pillions behind their fa-
vorite swains and their light-hearted
laughter mingling with the clatter of
hoofs echoed along the silent wood-
lands sounding fainter and fainter
until they gradually died away-and
the late scene of noise and frolic was
all silent and deserted ichabod only
lingered behind according to the cus-
tom of country lovers to have a
tete-a-tete with the heiress fully con-
vinced that he was now on the high
road to success what passed at this
interview i will not pretend to say
for in fact i do not know something
however i fear me must have gone
wrong for he certainly sallied forth
after no very great interval with an
air quite desolate and cliopfallen-
oh these women these women could
that girl have been playing off any
of her coquettish tricks-was her
encouragement of the poor pedagogue
all a mere sham to secure her con-
quest of his rival -heaven only
knows not i-let it suffice to say
ichabod stole forth with the air of
one who had been sacking a hen-roost
rather than a fair ladys heart
without looking to the right or left
to notice the scene of rural wealth on
which he had so often gloated he
went straight to the stable and with
several hearty cuffs and kicks roused
his steed most uncourteously from the
comfortable quarters in which he was
soundly sleeping dreaming of moun-
tains of com and oats and whole
valleys of timothy and clover

  it was the very witching time of
night that ichabod heavy-hearted and
crestfallen pursued his travel home-
wards along the sides of the lofty
hills which rise above tarry town
and which he had traversed so cheer-
ily in the afternoon the hour was
as dismal as himself far below him
the tappan zee spread its dusky and
indistinct waste of waters with here
and there the tall mast of a sloop
riding quietly at anchor under the
land in the dead hush of midnight

he could even hear the barking of the
watch-dog from the opposite shore of
the hudson but it was so vague and
faint as only to give an idea of his
distance from this faithful companion
of man now and then too the long-
drawn crowing of a cock accidentally
awakened would sound far far off
from some farmhouse away among
the hills-but it was like a dreaming
sound in his ear no signs of life oc-
curred near him but occasionally the
melancholy chirp of a cricket or per-
haps the guttural twang of a bull-
frog from a neighboring marsh as if
sleeping uncomfortably and turning
suddenly in his bed

  all the stories of ghosts and gob-
lins that he had heard in the after-
noon now came crowding upon his
recollection the night grew darker
and darker the stars seemed to sink
deeper in the sky and driving clouds
occasionally hid them from his sight
he had never felt so lonely and dis-
mal he was moreover approaching
the very place where many of the
scenes of the ghost stories had been
laid in the center of the road stood
an enormous tulip-tree which towered
like a giant above all the other trees
of the neighborhood and formed a
kind of landmark its limbs were
gnarled and fantastic large enough
to form trunks for ordinary trees
twisting down almost to the earth and
rising again into the air it was con-
nected with the tragical story of the
unfortunate andre who had been
taken prisoner hard by and was
universally known by the name of
major andres tree the common
people regarded it with a mixture of
respect and superstition partly out
of sympathy for the fate of its ill-
starred namesake and partly from
the tales of strange sights and doleful
lamentations told concerning it

  as ichabod approached this fearful
tree he began to whistle he thought
his whistle was answered-i was but
a blast sweeping sharply through the
dry branches as he appioached a


weird tales

little nearer he thought he saw some-
thing white hanging in the midst of
the tree-he paused and ceased
whistling but on looking more nar-
rowly perceived that it was a place
where the tree had been scathed by
lightning and the white wood laid
bare suddenly he heard a groan-
his teeth chattered and his knees
smote against the saddle it was but
the rubbing of one huge bough uion
another as they were swayed about by
the breeze he passed the tree in
safety but new perils lay before him

  about two hundred yards from the
tree a small brook crossed the road
and ran into a marshy and thickly
wooded glen known by the name of
wileys swamp a few rough logs
laid side by side served for a bridge
over this stream on that side of the
road where the brook entered the
wood a group of oaks and chestnuts
matted thick with wild grapevines
threw a cavernous gloom over it to
pass this bridge was the severest trial
it was at this identical spot that the
unfortunate andre was captured and
under the covert of those chestnuts
and vines were the sturdy yeomen
concealed who surprized him this
has ever since leen considered a
haunted stream and fearful are the
feelings of the schoolboy who has to
pass it alone after dark

  as he approached the stream his
heart began to thump he summoned
up however all his resolution gave
his horse half a score of kicks in the
ribs and attempted to dash briskly
across the bridge but instead of
starting forward the perverse old
animal made a lateral movement and
ran broadside against the fence icha-
bod whose fears increased with the
delay jerked the reins on the other
side and kicked lustily with the con-
trary foot it was all in vain his
steed started it is true but it was
only to plunge to the opposite side of
the road into a thicket of brambles
and alder bushes the schoolmaster
now bestowed both whip and heel

upon the starveling ribs of old gun-
powder who dashed forward snuf-
fling and snorting but came to a
stand just by the bridge with a sud-
denness that had nearly sent his rider
sprawling over his head just at this
moment a plashy tramp by the side of
the bridge caught the sensitive ear
of ichabod in the dark shadow of
the grove on the margin of the brook
he beheld something huge misshapen
black and towering it stirred not
but seemed gathered up in the gloom
like some gigantic monster ready to
spring upon the traveler

  the hair of the affrighted peda-
gogue rose upon his head with terror
what was to be done to turn and
fly was now too late and besides
what chance was there of escaping
ghost or goblin if such it was which
could ride upon the wings of the
wind summoning up therefore a
show of courage he demanded in
stammering accents-who are
you    he received no reply he re-
peated his demand in a still more agi-
tated voice still there was no
answer once more he cudgeled the
sides of the inflexible gunpowder
and shutting his eyes broke forth with
involuntary fervor into a psalm tune
just then the shadowy object of alarm
put itself in motion and with a
scramble and a bound stood at once
in the middle of the road though
the night was dark and dismal yet the
form of the unknown might now in
some degree be ascertained he ap-
peared to be a horseman of large di-
mensions and mounted on a black
horse of powerful frame he made
no offer of molestation or sociability
but kept aloof on one side of the road
jogging along on the blind side of
old gunpowder who had now got over
his fright and waywardness

  ichabod who had no relish for this
strange midnight companion and be-
thought himself of the adventure of
brom bones with the galloping
hessian now quickened his steed in
hopes of leaving him behind the
the legend of sleepy hollow



stranger however quickened his horse
to an equal pace ichabod pulled up
and fell into a walk thinking to lag
behind-the other did the same his
heart began to sink within him he
endeavored to resume his psalm tune
but his parched tongue clove to the
roof of his mouth and he could not
utter a stave there was something
in the moody and dogged silence of
this pertinacious companion that was
mysterious and appalling it was
soon fearfully accounted for on
mounting a rising ground which
brought the figure of his fellow-
traveler in relief against the sky
gigantic in height and muffled in a
cloak ichabod was horror-struck on
perceiving that he was headless-but
his horror was still more increased
on observing that the head which
should have rested on his shoulders
was carried before him on the pommel
of the saddle his terror rose to des-
peration  he rained a shower of kicks
and blows upon gunpowder hoping
by a sudden movement to give his
companion the slip-but the specter
started full jump with him away
then they dashed through thick and
thin stones flying and sparks flash-
ing at every bound ichabods flimsy
garments fluttered in the air as he
stretched his long lank body away
over his horses head in the eagerness
of his flight

  they had now reached the road
which turns off to sleepy hollow but
gunpowder who seemed possessed
with a demon instead of keeping up
it made an opposite turn and
plunged headlong down hill to the
left this road leads through a sandy
hollow shaded by trees for about a
quarter of a mile where it crosses the
bridge famous in goblin story and
just beyond swells the green knoll on
which stands the whitewashed church

  as yet the panic of the steed had
given his unskilful rider an apparent
advantage in the chase but just as
he had got half-way through the hol-
low the girths of the saddle gave way

and he felt it slipping from under
him he seized it by the pommel and
endeavored to hold it firm but in
vain and had just time to save him-
self by clasping old gunpowder round
the neck when the saddle fell to the
earth and he heard it trampled under
foot by his pursuer for a moment the
terror of hans van rippers wrath
passed across his mind-for it was his
sunday saddle but this was no time
for petty fears the goblin was hard
on his haunches and unskilful rider
that he was lie had much ado to
maintain his seat sometimes slipping
on one side sometimes  another and
sometimes jolted  the high ridge of
his horses backbone with a violence
that he verily feared would cleave him
asunder

  an opening in the trees now cheered
him with the hopes that the church
bridge was at hand the wavering
reflection of a silver star in the bosom
of the brook told him that he was not
mistaken he saw the walls of the
church dimly glaring under the trees
beyond he recollected the place
where brom boness ghostly com-
petitor had disappeared if i can
but reach that bridge   thought icha-
bod i am safe just then he
heard the black steed panting and
blowing close behind him he even
fancied that he felt his hot breath
another convulsive kick in the ribs
and old gunpowder sprang upon the
bridge he thundered over the re-
sounding planks he gained the op-
posite side and now ichabod cast a
look behind to see if his pursuer
should vanish according to rule in a
flash of fire and brimstone just then
he saw the goblin rising in his stir-
rups and in the very act of hurling
his head at him ichabod endeavored
to dodge the horrible missile but too
late it encountered his cranium with
a tremendous crash-he was tumbled
headlong into the dust and gun-
powder the black steed and the gob-
lin rider passed by like a whirlwind


weird tales

rphe next morning the old horse was

	-found without his saddle and
with the bridle under his feet sober-
ly cropping the grass at his masters
gate ichabod did not make his ap-
pearance at breakfast-dinner-hour
came but no ichabod the boys as-
sembled at the schoolhouse and
strolled idly about the banks of the
brook but no schoolmaster hans
van ripper now began to feel some
uneasiness about the fate of poor icha-
bod and his saddle an inquiry was
set on foot and after diligent investi-
gation they came upon his traces in
one part of the road leading to the
church was found the saddle trampled
in the dirt the tracks of horses
hoofs deeply dented in the road and
evidently at furious speed were
traced to the bridge beyond which
on the bank of a broad part of the
brook where the water ran deep and
black was found the hat of the un-
fortunate ichabod and close beside
it a shattered pumpkin

  the brook was searched but the
body of the schoolmaster was not to
be discovered hans van ripper as
executor of his estate examined the
bundle which contained all ins world-
ly effects they consisted of two
shirts and a half two stocks for the
neck a pair or two of worsted stock-
ings an old pair of corduroy small-
clothes  a rusty razor a book of psalm
tunes full of dogs cars and a
broken pitchpipe as to the books
and furniture of the schoolhouse
they belonged to the community ex-
cepting cotton mathers history of
witchcraft a new england alma-
nac and a book of dreams and for-
tune-telling  in which last was a sheet
of foolscap much scribbled and blotted
in several fruitless attempts to make a
copy of verses in honor of the heiress
of van tassel these magic books
and the poetic scrawl were forthwith
consigned to the flames by hans van
ripper who from that time forward
determined to send his children no
more to school observing that he

never knew any good come of this
same reading and writing whatever
money the schoolmaster possessed
and he had received his quarters pay
but a day or two before he must have
had about his person at the time of
his disappearance

  the mysterious event caused much
speculation at the church on the fol-
lowing sunday knots of gazers and
gossips were collected in the church-
yard at the bridge and at the spot
where the hat and pumpkin had been
found the stories of brouwer of
bones and a whole budget of others
were called to mind and when they
had diligently considered them all
and compared them with the symp-
toms of the present case they shook
their heads and came to the conclu-
sion that ichabod had been carried off
by the galloping hessian as he was
a bachelor and in nobodys debt no-
body troubled his head any more
about him the school was removed
to a different quarter of the hollow
and another pedagogue reigned in his
stead

  it is true an old farmer who had
been down to new york on a visit
several years after and from whom
this account of the ghostly adventure
was received brought home the intelli-
gence that ichabod crane was still
alive that he had left the neighbor-
hood partly through fear of the gob-
lin and hans van ripper and partly
in mortification at having been sud-
denly dismissed by the heiress that
he had changed his quarters to a dis-
tant part of the country had kept
school and studied law at the same
time had been admitted to the bar
turned politician electioneered writ-
ten for the newspapers and finally
had been made a justice of the ten
pound court brom bones too who
shortly after his rivals disappear-
ance conducted the blooming katrina
in triumph to the altar was observed
to look exceedingly knowing whenever
the story of ichabod was related and
the legend of sleepy hollow



always burst into a hearty laugh at
the mention of the pumpkin which
led some to suspect that he knew more
about the matter than he chose to tell

  the old country wives however
who are the best judges of these mat-
ters maintain to this day that icha-
bod was spirited away by super-
natural means and it is a favorite
story often told about the neighbor-
hood round the winter evening fire
the bridge became more than ever an
object of superstitious awe and that

may be the reason why the road has
been altered of late years so as to ap-
proach the church by the border of
the mill-pond the schoolhouse be-
ing deserted soon fell to decay and
was reported to be haunted by the
ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue
and the plowboy loitering homeward
of a still summer evening has often
fancied his voice at a distance chant-
ing a melancholy psalm tune among
the tranquil solitudes of sleepy
hollow

mg a merritts fine story the woman of the wood it is your pseudo-
scientific tales that i like most edmond hamilton easily leads here with
ray cummings a close second i agree with most of your readers in that
those stories dealing with unearthly forces as we know them of course are
best yet seabury quinn is one of my favorites lovecraft is great and
longs tale the space-eaters places him too high in my list of favorites
i make a plea for a quarterly of reprints from your regular issues or at least
some move in that direction my mouth has watered at the titles of some of
your stories from old issues before i was a reader of your magazine-tales
which were so good that they are still recalled and praised by some of your
readers who write in to the eyrie what thoughts a title like the wind
thai tramps the world brings up or the people of the comet a title like
that first must spontaneously be real enduring literature-and it is buried in
the past i shall never be satisfied until some author of weird tales dis-
covers a way to carry complete files of my favorite magazine into the here-
after i would gladly sizzle on a gridiron to read hamilton or merritt

    as to reprinting favorite stories from old issues we have never re-
printed any of our own stories for we have felt that it would be unfair to
print in weird tales any story that thousands of our readers must have read
in this magazine in a former issue but lately we have received many requests
that we reprint some of the cream of our previous stories-and these requests
come from readers who have already read the stories they ask us to reprint
three stories are particularly requested from issues of  and  the
wind that tramps the world by frank owen the stranger from kurdi
stan by e hoffmann price and the phantom farmhouse by seabury quinn
how about it readers-do you want us to use as our monthly reprint story
an occasional fine tale taken from old issues of this magazine or shall we con-
tinue our present policy of choosing our monthly weird story reprint en-
tirely from among famous weird stories that have never before appeared in
weird tales unless we receive an overwhelming number of requests for the
reprint of old favorites from weird tales we shall not reprint any of them
imtil at least ten years after their first publication in this magazine-and
weird tales is not yet six years old but the decision is up to you if you
really want them and want them enough to let us know your wishes in no un-
certain terms then we will give you every few months one of your old
favorites from this magazine as our monthly weird story reprint but we
shall not change our policy in this regard unless you really want us to do so
weird tales is your magazine and we shall be guided entirely by what you
the readers wish us to do

continued from page 

 marry us and then you will belong
 to me for ever and for ever

   tomorrow she repeated i
 will be ready

   we stayed out in the moonlight
 sitting by the doorway under the jas-
 mine vine until midnight lovers for
 the first time then i got up and
 told her she must sleep

    we must start very early in the
 morning  i said  it is a long ride 
 i went to bed and heard her mov-
 ing about the house until at last i
 fell asleep happier than i had ever
 been or ever shall be in my life

  in the morning when i got up
there was no sign of chulita no one
at all in the house but the little brown
dog asleep on the rug with a faded
jasmine flower under her paw

  failing to find chulita any-
where i went to the office and spent
the day half-heartedly working
puzzled and unhappy why had she
failed me had anything happened
to her had perhaps that mexican
returned again the eery thought
crossed the edges of my mind send-
ing faint cold through all my veins
-the thought of the strange impos-
sible legend which one finds in every
nation and told in every tongue the
legend of the loup-garou the were-
wolf that ridiculous tale believed by
the indians of a being under a curse
and doomed to be human by day or
by night and a dog or wolf for the
other twelve hours

   i looked down at the little dog
 i had rescued that day at cuerna-
 vaca the day of the same evening
 that chulita had appeared in my
 house the dogs deep brown eyes
 were fixed upon me with a look of
 sadness and utter devotion nd its

weird tales

mouth was drawn up at one comer
by the scar into a sort of a half smile
-so like chulitas so terribly like
i shuddered and even in the hot sun-
light pouring through the window my
hands felt cold and wet the dog
sighed profoundly and came over and
laid her head heavily upon my feet

then i returned i found chu-

  v	 iita dressed for travel in one
of the prettiest of the dresses i had
had sent out to her from mexico
city some weeks before she was
so pretty and and so sweet and eager
that fears and cautions slid off my
back like water from a ducks wing
we mounted and rode through the
fragrant moonlit night down past
mist-hung ravines where the perfumes
of a thousand orchids enveloped us
down and downward and at last into
moonlit sleeping cuernavaca

  i roused the priest and we were
married in the dark little church
the priests sister and a sleepy
mexican lad were witnesses the
civil ceremony would be attended to
later we went out of the church to
where our horses stood and just as
we came around the stone buttress
we ran into a mexican heaven alone
knows how he came there by what
evil chance he was abroad and pass-
ing at that hour and place but
there he was in the clear moonlight
i recognized instantly his great bulk
his evil eyes and drooping mustache
he snapped out a single word

  chulita turned and saw him and
screamed a knife flashed from his
hand and i sprang at him

  it was a long and bitter fight for
this time he had not been drinking
and he had his full strength i had
him at last and felt his body sud-
denly grow limp as his breath left
him beneath my fingers but he had
me too the blood was pouring
from a gash in my head and the

world spun and went out as i col-
lapsed

  the stars were paling when i
came to myself still lying across the
body of the mexican in the complete-
ly deserted street evidently no one 
had seen us or been near the
horses were still tied to the hitching-
post i staggered to my feet and
looked about for chulita she was
gone there was no one there noth-
ing but the little brown dog lying
dead in the moonlight with a mexi-
can knife through her heart i never
could find chulita again nor anyone
who had seen her or any trace of
her there is no explanation is
there doctor youve been out in
lonely places in mexico is there

  dr mcgonigal came out of his
revery

  er-no mr larrison i canna
say there is he answered

  except of course unless con-
tinued larrison unless-however
that way madness lies

  he rose and soon the storm hav-
ing died down in the meantime he
left the club for his rooms

  the rest of us said nothing for
awhile

  bob wheeler spoke suddenly

  er ah he began didnt i
hear somewhere that larrison uses
some form of dope

  the doctor grunted

  i admitted that i had heard the
same rumor

  ay perhaps said the doctor
pulling  his greatcoat god-
forsaken place acatlan gets a man
one way or another

  that would explain a story like
that wheeler went on

  again the doctor grunted

  still he said in his slow scotch
way as he pulled on his gloves im
wondering lads which came first the
dope or the dog good-night fel
lows

  the door closed after him

the polar doom

continued from page 

david though wasted no glance upon
them pushing rapidly oil until both
men were sweating profusely in the
tropical warmth it was with an ef-
fort that warren remembered himself
to be within a few hundred miles of
the supreme icy desolation of the pole
itself

  the great light-shaft ahead was
growing in apparent size as they
forged on toward it and mcquirk had
begun to move more carefully more
quietly suddenly he flung himself
prostrate on the ground pulling war-
ren down beside him in a moment
there passed over them a buzzing
dwindling whine and then they saw
silhouetted against the white bril-
liance ahead a dozen or more dark
shapes that were dropping smoothly
down toward the mound from which
the light sprang

  the first raiders mcquirk was
whispering theyve come back
god knows where theyve been

  the two lay motionless for a mo-
ment then crept stealthily on
through the unending lanes of gleam-
ing domes they threaded their way
forging on and on until at last they
were within a few thousand feet of
the dark low mound of the light and
could catch a few drifting fragments
of whispering clicking speech from
the mound itself and once a snatch
of human-voiced imitation of the
former at which warren felt his arm
convulsively gripped by the other
and now they had slowed their prog-
ress to a crawl and were creeping on-
ward with infinite stealth and pa-
tience hiding as much as possible
from the revealing light from ahead
behind the domes and their shadows
crawling from shadow to shadow and
drawing ever nearer toward the sides
of the low broad mound

  at last they had reached the end of
the forest of domes which encircled

weird tales

that mound and crouched in the
shadow of one at the very edge but a
few yards from its sloping side
crouching there they heard the sounds
from its summit clearly now and saw
beneath the mighty brilliance above
scores of the dark hideous shapes of
the toad-men clustered on the sum-
mit moving to and fro mcquirk had
paused now and his eyes held war-
ren s

  its death for us if we show our-
selves on that summit he said in a
whisper but up there is our last
chance  

 warren gazed up toward the
mounds thronged top and something
seemed to tighten across his chest
then without speaking his hand went
forth to the other who gripped it
once then crawled slowly out of the
protecting shadow across the narrow
illuminated belt that separated them
from the mounds sloping side and
warren followed

  once again they paused glancing
up toward the summit then crawled
on up its side toward the mounds
top up up toward death until they
were within a few yards of that top
a few feet a few-

  boom

  a tremendous powerful note deep
and low and muffled strangely it
sounded from the air around them
from over all the island it seemed
thundering out with cosmic deliber-
ate grandeur

  mcquirk gripped the airmans
arm the domes he whispered
theyre opening theyre-

  boom

  again the vast deep note had
pealed out a mighty note whose
source was the myriad synchronized
individual notes from the myriad
domes around them and the toad-
men above had heard too and were
rushing down the mounds side only
a score of yards from where the two
crouched down toward the domes
from which arose that mighty warn-
ing note

  boom 

  with the last note there was a faint
sighing sound a sudden increasing
babel of whispering speech-sounds
and in the sides of the massed dark
domes warren glimpsed expanding
circles opening figures emerging   

  david beside him crawled sudden-
ly upward to the edge of the mounds
summit turned to whisper rapidly
its a chance theyre all off the
summit all gone down among the
opening domes and now-

  without finishing he crawled up
onto the flat summit itself followed
instantly by the airman then they
sprang to their feet glanced for a
moment over the broad ruin-littered
summit and then were racing across
it for  it was no sign of the toad-
men for the moment and a hundred
yards away loomed the great cylinder
from which the light-shaft soared-the
great cylinder and the switches on its
side

  speeding across the mounds sum-
mit toward the cylinder warren
heard a mighty wave of clicking
whispering speech from all around
knew it to be the speech of the newly
released thousands from the forest of
acred domes around the mound
they were within a hundred feet of
the cylinder of the switches were
staggering on on-and then both
stopped dead in their tracks

  ahead of them a dark figure had
suddenly sprung from behind the
cylinder itself a human figure the
figure of a tall black-browed man who
raised a hand toward them in warning
gesture holding them with his mad
burning eyes warren heard issuing
from his lips a clicking sibilant cry
and then heard it answered by scores
of cries from those below the mound
heard the sudden scramble of their
feet as they raced up toward the sum-
mit in answer to that cry then
david beside him had flung an arm
out toward the man ahead in a ges-
ture of infinite entreaty

  angus he cried his voice ago-
weird tales



 nized for the love of god angus

   the man before them answered only
 with another hissing cry a cry echoed
 again by the hordes who rushed up
 the mounds sides toward his aid

   and then david shot him down
 warren heard the pistol crack beside
 him and saw the mad figure before
 them crumple to the ground a spread-
 ing red stain on the breast of his
 shirt then he had leapt over and
 past that prostrate figure and was at
 the switches in the cylinders side was
 jamming the great red one frenziedly
 upward just as the hordes of toad-
 men from below rushed up onto the
 mounds summit

   as the great switch clicked beneath
 his hands the mighty shaft of light
 above vanished and at the same mo-
 ment there vanished with it the flood
 of tropical heat about them replaced
 instantly by the bitter polar cold that
 searing icy cold which the great heat-
 magnet alone had held at bay and
 beneath that cold the toad-men on the
 summit were stumbling and falling
 writhing and twisting and then lying
 still the white of their bodies chang-
 ing swiftly to black far out on the
 island and over all its surface was
 rising a confused babel of whispering
 cries and speech that cut short and
 ceased as the mighty hordes from the
 domes fell beneath the icy sword of
 the arctic cold the toad-men who
 had slept for ages had arisen from
 that sleep to be annihilated the
 polar race had awakened at last-to
 death

   warren turned now saw his com-
 panion kneeling beside the man on the
 ground stepped to his side and with
 him gazed down into the face of the
 dying scientist it was a face from
 which the madness had been suddenly
 wiped away from which the mans
 wide eyes looked up at them uncom-
 prehendingly

   why davie he said staring up
 into his brothers face with infinite
 surprize and wonder why davie

txawn was flinging its white bril-
liance across the island when
warren and david made ready at
last to leave in the interval they
had buried the anthropologists body
in the fast-freezing earth where it
had fallen and then had taken their
way slowly down from the mound and
across the island across that desert of
stupendous death where the hordes of
the newly released toad-men lay black
and stiff and dead struck down by the
polar cold now after an examina-
tion which showed it to be compara-
tively uninjured they were wheeling
warrens plane into position for a
take-off on the long level beach

  in a moment warren was in the
pilots seat and his companion
stepped toward the propeller then
paused glancing away into the island
where the mound and its great cylin-
der rose black against the sunrise
the airman saw now that his lips were
working

  that cylinder mcquirk was
whispering   the domes the secrets in-
side them-we gain all that the world
gains that and we lose-

  he turned abruptly spun the pro-
peller once twice and then the motor
had caught and was roaring its song
of power in a moment mcquirk was
in the seat behind the airman and the
plane was rolling down the long beach
slanting sharply up into the sunlight
and speeding toward the south

  moments they flashed on and then
with a common impulse the two
turned and looked back far behind
now lay the island a dark-brown
mass against the gray berg-dotted
sea on its surface there seemed to
glitter a myriad brilliant points of
light shining dazzling it was the
light of the rising sun glancing off
the myriad domes of metal which had
held for eons the menace and the
power of the polar doom
