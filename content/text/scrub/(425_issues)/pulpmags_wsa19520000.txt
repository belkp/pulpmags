greater
love hath
no man than
to write letters
to an annual
publication
way back in
 when the
preceding- issue
of this anthol-
ogy appeared featuring twice in
time by manly wade wellman
the alien intelligence by jack
williamson and the chessboard of
mars by eando binder a number of
fans promptly betook themselves to
the typewriter

  there is something impressive
about this to send off a letter
knowing it will be a year-if ever
-before he gets any action on it
takes a dogged sort of loyalty en-
countered only in science-fiction
fans

  writes mr r r anger of otta-
wa canada

  when the first issue came out
everyone wondered if this annual
would fold after one issue as had all
the others published before but
with the  issue it seems certain
that wonder story annual
will become a landmark a yearly
anthology or a par with those cost-
ing ten times as much your back-
log of available material is one of
the richest available to any editor
and you are using it well

  a lot of hewing of the backlog
went into this years choices the
stories collected here are those we
thought had something extra-a
touch of quality which made them
more significant than most read
them and see and if as a result
you feel the urge to write us a let-
ter let yourself go

  well be right here again next
year

a short short story complete on this page
by e everett evans

jean cox-
art was
something of
a telepathist not a
professional but an
exceptionally gifted
amateur so he
knew that he had
been receiving a
telepathic call these
past five days but
he was vaguely
worried about it
and had not yet attempted an answer he
could not decipher just what was being
said although there was something slightly
familiar about the word-ideas

  finally after several days he caught on
it was not as he had guessed at first a
foreign language rather it was a very dis-
torted form of english there was a slur-
ring-a clipped elision to the word and sen-
tence structure that had delayed his un-
derstanding now he had been forced to the
belief that the person sending was from the
future

  then came the day when he felt confi-
dent enough of his own ability to reply to
the constant attempts to contact him in-
stantly he was conscious of a renewed ef-
fort from his unknown communicator

  what year are you living in  the voice-
less voice inquired anxiously

  this is nineteen forty-eight what
year are you in  coxart replied

  i am about one million years in the
future i am so very pleased that i have at
last been able to contact someone from your
generation i have been trying to do so for
years

  what is it like in your day it seems so
incredibly distant from ours that it must be
altogether different

  oh i suppose it is we have all the

leisure we want because everything is done
for us by automatic machinery and by ro-
bots we spend our days with our studies
our hobbies or in pure pleasures

  that is indeed different we have to
work about forty hours a week in order to
earn our living

the voice of the future seemed to
chuckle then continued i have read
of that but it is because of our conditions
here that i have tried to get in touch with
someone from your age there is a very
important task which i wish you to do for
me are you willing to attempt it

  that would depend upon the nature of
the task of course if it is something that
i can do and that does not interfere with
my ethical concepts i will be very pleased
to do anything i can for one of our de-
scendants from the future just what is it
you wish done

  i want you to bring a legal suit against
a certain famous mercantile or manufac-
turing corporation of your day i have in
my possession one of their products it has
been an heirloom in our family ever since
your time there was a guarantee with the
article which has proven itself to be incor-
rect and thus they are criminally negli-
gent

  well one million years is quite a length
of time for anything to last as you must
admits my friend

  i grant you that but their guarantee
was made to cover- all time nor was there
any limit to the length of time

  oh i begin to guess what you mean
your heirloom then is-

  that is correct my foreversharp pen
which was guaranteed not for years not
for life but guaranteed forever it no
longer works-i cant get it fixed here-and
i wanna sue

 tine of every scientist which require
 a special terminology to account for
 them this was one of these cases
 leclair searched his memory for the
 proper words as he gathered his
 working papers together left the
 foundry mounted a stone stairway
 and pushed open the door of the
 material-testing laboratory

   it was a large room with white
 walls and a tiled floor littered with

wonder story annual

but the dull october sky shed only
a feeble light through the windows
and surfaces of steel and brass re-
flecting the glare of the electric
lights

  in one corner of the room a tall
thin young man with a long horsey
face was bent attentively over a
testing stand watching some ma-
chine through thick glasses leclair
extending toward him the graph
which was the result of his investi-
gations began a laborious explana-
tion    pierre selevine always
rude when at work pushed away
the extended paper without reply-
ing

  with eyes fixed on the needle that
was registering his results he at-
tached a weight whose pressure
multiplied through a system of
levers was crushing some mass of
heated material his fingers moved
with precision over the polished
shafts regulating the application of
the heat or the speed of rotation of
the moving parts understanding
that it was useless to interrupt at
present leclair stepped aside

  the melancholy light threw a sad
and aged expression onto the faces
of the pair

  through the windows the ruddy
orb of a sun deprived of all strength
by shrouding veils of mist and
smoke was barely visible under its
gloomy inspection an industrial city
was engaged in its daily tasks from
the window through which leclair
was surveying the scene he could
catch a confused view of the habita-
tions of the workmen a fragment of
the river and of the factories of the
city of denain arranged in neat
cubistic patterns of building and
chimney

 the escaut river glided past
docks encumbered with the mer-
chandise of the world and beneath
a tracery of bridges and cranes im-
prisoned by dams stained with oil
and coal-dust the water seemed to
be made of solid metal only for an
instant would its surface be tfoubled

by the passage of some tug dragging
its long train of laden barges roll-
ing the water away from their
prows in sparkling ripples in the
distance the horizon was hidden by
an agglomeration of buildings dom-
inated by blast furnaces

  sensitive as he was to delicate
forms and colors leclair detested
this corner of the earth which had
been rendered so ugly by the indus-
try of man a confused rumbling
went up from it night and day a
rumbling that was produced by
mighty machines in factories where
thousands labored of thundering
hoofs and groaning wheels and
bridges that vibrated under the
weight of passing trains

  muscular workmen toiled in the
mines and at the banks of the river
others hammered the softened met-
al in the light of its own fires lineal
descendants of the men of an earlier
age who jxured the molten bronze
from crucibles of stone they con-
tinued mans conquest of inanimate
nature forging the tools which gave
to one feeble animal his dominion
over all the rest after this victory
over all the beasts of earth man
still fought here forcing rebellious
metal to his service at the price of
toil and torment

leclair was absorbed in the con-
templation of the scene when
someone called his name softly
turning he saw fanny the girl
who polished the gauges of the test-
ing laboratory seated behind a
grinding machine she beckoned to
him she was from waes a daughter
of the laboring classes somewhat

admired this young man so elegant
in his sober and well-tailored

  leclair stepped over to her and

paris who beat her and was in the

science-fiction is in a small way akin to scientific method it ofte
predicts certain results as a logical extension of known phenomena the
difference lies in that the scientist having predicted his results goes on to
achieve them experimentally or failing that modifies his predictions and
starts all over again while science-fiction having predicted-or extra-
polated as any stf addict will insist the process be called-simply sits back
and lets our wonderful terrible ever-changing human situation prove it right
or wrong

  science-fiction writers are a forward-looking bunch and their predictions
are usually founded on a proposed scientific addition to the present set-up
   a new gadget a new technique the final realization of space flight with
all its attendant problems of colonization interplanetary politics interstellar
warfare it is the bootstrap process we invent x and shortly thereafter
our society finds itself based in part on x but such is not the case with
death of iron

   it is based upon the subtraction of x   

  which in this case is iron fix your mind please on the degree to
which our civilization is based on iron    from can-openers to sky-scrapers
needles to ocean-iiners from steam-shovels to printing-presses to guns to

home from the factory of mo rain

perpetual horror of rain after the
usual lamentations about the state
of the roads he went grumblingly
about his tasks

  selevine having finished what he
was doing drew a short pipe from
his pocket filled and lit it and with-
out a word came over to shake le-
clairs hand then noticing for the
first time the graphs in which le-
clair had expressed the results of his
tests on the high-speed steels he
seized them eagerly reading these

formula must be defective

  youre joking why only a few
days ago we got the most wonderful
results there must be an error in
calculations

  but i assure you   protested
leclair

  oh well never mind it isnt
important well take another
sample thats all anybody can
make a mistake i just finished my
experiment with a mixup as bad as 
yours you know ive been studying
natural steel alloys for some time
their properties are not very well
known some of them have an enor-

they are unstable and nervous un-
der a shock they break like glass
very little use in industry of course
but they offer an interesting field
of research i had succeeded in pro-
ducing a ductile high-carbon steel
but after a little time its cohesion
seems to have been spontaneously
destroyed queer isnt it

  eut how do you explain it

  i have been trying to interpret
the phenomenom by calculation its
a tough job yesterday i was at it
late working over this formula
burying myself neck-deep in mathe-
matical analysis for a moment i
thought i had discovered something
i stopped working and went over to
the window to get a breath of fresh
air my room looks out over the
essel forge shop as i stood there
i could see the men hammering the
metal amid the flames and for some
reason the spectacle filled me with
a kind of exultation it seemed to
me that i was just at the edge of
translating into comprehensibility
one of the most profound secrets of
the material universe that i was
about to express all the transforma-
tions of iron in a single formula 

  he stopped as though a little
ashamed of his enthusiasm his eyes
roaming about the room

  where was i oh yes-i turned
back to the table when i had
worked out the results of all the
formulas simplified their products
i found i had for a solution-a
mathematical expression that could
not be expressed by any material
result and which was inherently ab-
surd i could have wept with rage
every time i try to solve certain
problems of metallurgy i run into
the impossible  do you know
there are crystalline equilibriums in
metal that are quite unpredictable
very much like the reactions of liv-
ing matter

  an old workman clad in the blue
jumper of a mechanic shuffled into
the laboratory and approaching

selevine informed him that a new
lot of metal was ready to be ex-
amined

  the two engineers went toward
the foundry which was located be-
yond the workshops passing along
a gallery which ran around the
building at a height of twenty feet
ajove the generators below they
stepped suddenly into a deafening
chorus of sounds beneath their feet
in the blue artificial day of the arc-
lights electric motors whirled in
their carapaces of steel dynamos
added their heavy monotonous note
to the din and traveling cranes
rumbled about them

it was a harmony of swift pre-
cise movement of the extention
and retraction of driving rods in
feline gestures of the calculated
mad interlocking of gears of rapid-
ly-moving cams and pinions the
machines toiled with the metal all
around a mighty knife sliced it into
sections a hundred lathes peeled the
sections like so many fruits the files
bit it with their fine hard teeth the
grinding wheels shaped it amid a
display of burning sparks silvery-
shining drills bored to its heart
saws tore at it modified in form
and substance the steel cried out
with a thousand voices-some rau-
cous some sonorous shrill squeals
and shrieks of agony then out-
sounding all the rest came the heavy
beat of a trip-hammer on a plate

  they encountered the superin-
tendent of the factory

  well how about my test fig-
ures he asked

  leclair hesitated and then prom-
ised youll get them by the end
of the week monsieur lefevre

 as they reached the foundry a
puddler came to assure them that
the steel was ready

  the converters of the old type
with crucibles were subterranean
and were heated by gas-jets the flow
of which was regulated from above
the ground lids of refractory
the death of iron



 earths half-closed the vents from
 whose mouths there now escaped
 puffs of suffocating heat

   right before one of these open-
 ings a foundryman clothed in his
 tabard of leather and wet gloves
 plunged in a long-handled pair of
 tongs and drew forth a crucible of
 the metal whose burning white
 changed to a rose color as it struck
 the outer air with another tool he
 skillfully skimmed the floating scum
 from the pot and turning out a glob
 of rapidly hardening metal dropped
 it beneath a hammer which struck
 it flat in a shower of sparks the
 glowing blade of metal tempered in
 icy water was seized by the jaws of
 two gigantic pincers and broken in
 half selevine examining the grain
 of the fracture declared the fusion
 of the metal satisfactory

   through drawn lashes he contem-
 plated the white hot steel making
 several observations about the heat-
 treatment of the other batches in
 the converters he went to and fro
 in the narrow place without seeming
 in the least affected by the heat
 experiencing a singular pleasure in
 breathing the superheated air halt-
 ing here and there to examine
 samples of the batches under treat-
 ment his companion who had gone
 outside heard the noon bell ring
 without seeing him reappear and
 without waiting any longer left the
 factory with the last groups of
 workmen

   there was a special canteen for
 the engineers at the side of the shop
 but leclair preferred to take his
 lunch outside the premises in a little
 restaurant where selevine and pillot
 frequently joined him today he
 was alone in the stall reserved for
 guests of importance

   a waitress brought him a plate-
 lunch of plentiful size which leclair
 finished with rapidity

   sniffing the odor of his lukewarm
 coffee mingled with that of his ciga-
 rette he abandoned himself to vague
 reveries the incidents of the morn-

mg- passed in review before his
mind and he considered unhappily
the prospect of having to repeat his
task

  once more he regretted having
left morocco and wondered if he bad
not interpreted the promises of mo-
rain his employer in a manner too
favorable to himself but the chance
had been too good to be missed at
thirty an engineer should be on the
road to success and the head of the
steel company had certainly been
generous

  aside from practical considera-
tions there was the presence of mine
morain at denain to keep him there
he recalled the grey eyes and deli-
cate profile of renee morain and all
his evil humor disappeared

  one oclock near him the steel-
workers in blouses and overalls
their heavy muscles rippling under
dirty skins were consuming their
lunches washing them down with
draughts of cider or wine

  leclair wait out a single ray of
sunlight striking athwart two
douds gilded the side of the street
which always deserted at meal-
times was now beginning to fill up
again a group of workmen emerged
from a wineshop saluting the en-
gineer awkwardly at the corner
ahead he saw pillot get out of a car
and made a detour to avoid being
borecf by his conversation it took
him down a street where a group of
working girls went dothed in gray
-bare-headed youth in them tri-
umphing over the effects of labor
one of them in whom he recognized
fanny turned toward him with a
clear peal of laughter

  the young man turned away an-
noyed he could not understand how
he had come to be caught in a pro-
voking flirtation with her and re-
called with a eertain repugnance
how they had stood in the angle of
the passage that led to his part of
the factory as she leaned to him
he had felt the lithe young body
under the sordid grey clothes and

bad kissed her full on the lips it
was dark there neither of them had
seen the approach of selevine who
stood regarding them with a smile
leclair irritated had questioned the
russian

  well what do you waat to butt
in for

  selevine had shrugged his shoul-
ders

  perhaps you didnt know that
girl lias a lover

  and what of it

  since that revelation leclair had
avoided the company of the young
working-girl seeing her there in
the street laughing and gay he
wondered how much truth selevines
innuendo had contained a mere lie
perhaps

ii

first trouble

for eight months leclair had
been working under selevines
orders at the factorv of morain and
co

  his principal duty was that of
testing the high-speed steels which
were the specialty of the firm he
performed this task well but with-
out enthusiasm and with a regular-
ity that had become a trifle me-
chanical

  his chief on the other hand took
a passionate and irregular interest
in his work he was in bad health
and was subject to violent fits of
depression but he was interested in
what he did and for days would let
it keep him even from eating and
speaking then all at once his hu-
mor would change without any
reasonable cause

  selevine was also interested in
mathematical physics and took a
certain mystical pleasure in the ma-
terial with which he labored tak-
ing leclair into the foundry he
the death of iron	

would show him by what substances
incorporated in the fluid masses and
by what methods of heat-treatment
the different types of steel were
produced

  there amid the mystery of in-
genuous combinations the radiant
body of the metal was altered the
fire-god reigned

  fire took all the diverse forms of
which it is capable appeared in
tongues of purple in ruby-colored
vapors in gems in wild dream-flow-
ers

  it expanded throughout the irons
as they fused pierced the heart of
every blast-furnace and slept in the
cold blocks of steel ready to waken
under a shock

  at the gesture of the foundryman
naked beneath his leather tabard a
retort would turn over a jet of
violently-driven air suddenly re-
leased into the mass sent long gold-
en flames tipped with purple rush-
ing from the mouth of the vessel
amid a terrible roaring vaporized
jets of lava sulphur-yellow emer-
ald-green and striped with violent
vapors dashed forth to break in
showers of twinkling stars

  the steel was refined in electric
furnaces girdled with brass tre-
mendous accumulations of energy
were gathered in these pockets of
silica and refractory brick then
with the current shut off the elec-
trodes were lifted out by systems of
automatic counterweights and the
steel poured out in little brooks
whose whiteness struck the eye with
blinding brilliance

  samples were taken from the
cooled ingots the microscope re-
vealed their crystalline structure
under the object-glass of that in-
strument could be distinguished the
curious designs of the material-mo-
saics and carpet-patterns with inter-
weaving lines the hard fracture
steels gave a delicate pale blue field
starred with tiny white grains the
mild steels had delicate waterings
with shell-like patterns like those in

silk or mother-of-pearl others were
graven with tiny hieroglyphics on-
ly selevine could read correctly these
inscriptions that told the story of the
inner life of matter

  to the information he thus ob-
tained was joined that which result-
ed from the various mechanical tests
machines as precise as watch-move-
ments subjected the samples to slow
traction tension or torsion the fact
that they moved in well-oiled silence
did not exclude their possession of
indomitable force

  the engineer bending his thin
bony face over the machines would
follow the movement of a needle on
a scale or of a stylograph across a
drum levers as sensitive as the an-
tennae of an insect seemed no more
than the prolongations of his delicate
fingers as with the slightest of
touches he applied the force that rent
the material apart

  in those machines chains were
pulled to deformity and breakage
steel cables gave way their sections
vibrating one by one as the torn
ends leaped into the air like the
heads of snakes

  another machine determined the
hardness of steels by the depressions
left in their surface by a ball driv-
en into it by titanic pressure an-
other filed the surface with a curi-
ous duplication of human gestures
in the process

  shining with reflections under the
cold electric lights the instruments
appeared as torturing implements of
some nightmare inquisition at the
same time suggesting the stiff move-
ments of giant insects which with
articulated limbs and heavy cara-
paces tore to pieces in their mandi-
bles the living body of the metal

it was while testing samples of
high-speed steel that leclair
thought he found the machines less
supple and sensitive than before
one might almost have said that
some heavy and ignorant hand had
fumbled with them until they be-

came tired from abnormal efforts
and yet the effect was so tenuous as
to be beyond the range of observa-
tion the engineer had only a vague
impression of something that he was
unable to pin down

  several dayslater as he was pass-
ing through the lathe department he
heard voices raised in argument
choleur the foreman who exercised
a violent and somewhat capricious
authority over his subordinates was
shouting that someone had for a
second time broken an important
part of a big automatic lathe the
workman in charge of the imple-
ment was defending himself vigor-
ously and calling on his fellows to
bear witness that he had regulated
the instrument correctly he com-
plained that it must have contained
some hidden defect which had
brought about the fracture

  in spite of his protests the me-
chanic was dismissed but the man
who replaced him was no more
lucky a few days later the main rod
of a turret-lathe bent suddenly en-
gaging in the mass of rotating metal
the jaws tore loose the tools and
their attachments injuring the man
who was guiding the machine the
same day the sliding parts of a big
plane suddenly collapsed

  choleur filled the air with his
curses

  suspicious and with side-glances
at the men about him he examined
the sections that had failed the
idea that this series of accidents was
not the result of chance had oc-
curred to him lefevre had the same
thought but neither of them could
find the slightest basis for such a
conclusion they reluctantly accep-
ted the misfortunes as purely fortui-
tous when four days later the main
power-transmission shaft of the
shop suddenly gave way tearing
down some of the steel trussing of
the roof in its fall

  microscopic examination of the
breakages revealed to selevine a
steel that had been submitted to

extraordinary stresses fatigued by
over-exertion

  it must be that big hammer he
told leclair when they were in the
laboratory together the one they
installed near the lathe-room recent-
ly the continual shocks set up a vi-
bration in machines already submit-
ted to considerable strain and in
the long run bring about a modifi-
cation in the structure of the metal
which breaks down its resistance
at least thats the only explanation
that occurs to me

  the electric light died out as he
spoke then flashed once and went
out for good

leclair telephoned to laval for
the breakdown gang the wire
carried a series of not very pleasant
remarks to his ears in reply an-
noyed by the imperative tone of the
engineer the mechanic was object-
ing vigorously

  i dont know whats the matter
with everyone around here lately
declared leclair in an irritated tone
if i were the boss    that man
laval is becoming impossible he
counts on his stand-in with you and
i cant ask him to do a single thing
without getting some kind of an in-
solent answer with martin i ran
into the same hostility only he hides
it under a good-natured air that
doesnt mean a thing the old fool
exaggerates his deafness so as to in-
terpret orders in a manner to suit
himself

  in order to avoid labor he deploys
all the resources of his intelligence
once the danger of having to work
is over he has to take a long rest to
recover from the shock of being
asked to do something he sleeps on
the job with a skinful of wine too
decidedly these workmen have no
ideal but getting drunk

  at least thats a concrete idea
replied selevine tranquilly and
about the only concrete idea that
anyone has these days

  your point of view is all wrong
the death of iron



old man believe me its necessary
to be firm with people like that the
least indulgence they interpret as a
sign of weakness you have to be se-
vere with them to get any respect
my predecessor at said machou was
a humanitarian of your type he had
what are called advanced ideas and
tried to apply some of them in the
department he directed the result
was even beyond his hopes three
months after he came on the job it
was impossible to get any kind of ef-
fective work out of the laborers
their demands grew in proportion
to what they got the more inof-
fensive ones merely kept happily
stewed all day long the workshops
were full of public women and pub-
lic brawls at the least excuse the
italians hauled out their knives and
threatened to start cutting throats
most of the time they did their
threatening from a distance though
-out of delicacy of sentiment i sup-
pose every time they tried to clamp
discipline on again there was a strike
and a miniature riot

  and then you appeared on the
scene

  i did i chased the foreigners and
horsewhipped a few of the natives-
under due form of colonial justice
of course but it was too late they
never really reestablished order

  leclairs glance fell on the big
microscope of which selevine was
adjusting the screw the half-shad-
ed lamp lit the pale profile of the ob-
server outlining his sharp nose and
finely-graven lips and emphasizing
the bitterness around the corners of
the mouth and the heavy-lidded
eyes red with sleeplessness

  youre tiring yourself old man
the other shrugged his shoulders
a vague pattern was audible in
the adjacent corridor leclair
glanced at the clock on the wall and
as he did so someone in a white
laboratory coat entered

  well gang its the hour

  it was thus that pillot designated
the hour par excellence the hour of

quitting work at the same moment
came the piercing sound of the fac-
tory whistle

  after a rapid toilet the young
men mingled with the crowd of la-
borers which the factories were dis-
gorging into the mean streets of the
industrial city

the soul of metal

leaving the factory leclair
went home slipped into his eve-
ning clothes and directed his steps
toward the morain home

  his way lay through the hamlet
of trechy almost entirely devoted
to workmens homes little narrow
streets whose squat houses and
smoke-grimed walls looked incred-
ibly ugly in the trembling light of
the old-fashioned street-lamps a
little further on the buildings be-
gan to space out he found himself
in a district where a frantic hurried
existence was carried on behind
glass and steel bridges swung their
long legs across the waters of a ca-
nal united by long lines of wire
electric moons threw their somewhat
sinister light across the ocean coal
dumps rails locomotives piles of
ore or scrap iron rose out of the
darkness here and there

  a quarry opened beside his path
mercury-vapor lamps threw heavy
shadows around laden men and over-
worked horses in the ravined declivi-
ties a wheel turned at the shaft
mechanism of a mine a big machine
moved somewhere with a rhythmi-
cal beat

  passing the naval foundry he saw
the red light streaking across the
sky while every one of a thousand
windows reflected it back lit by the
blazing furnaces below the pillars
of smoke took on a kind of magic
splendor

  but leclair was indifferent to the
splendor of the spectacle he walked
along in a kind of waking dream his
mind at random over the events of
the day his memories of the rail
marocains the thought of what his
share in the commission on that sale
would amount to and the wife of his
superior

  with a certain simplicity he ar-
gued out the affair she made a
marriage of convenience in a big
city she would already have taken
a lover but here the opportunity is
lacking certainly she ought to be
bored with life he did not carry
this line of reasoning through to its
logical conclusion for without in the
least counting on her yielding to
him he was imagining a tender al-
most platonic love-affair which
would become more only by one of
those accidents that chance places in
the way of lovers

  this hesitation in his imaginings
was his sacrifice to decency in a
town of such limited social life an
affair of this sort would become
known at once morain was an at-
tentive and jealous husband if he
harbored as much as one single sus-
picion leclairs own future would
be hopelessly compromised that
cold strong man so firm and broad
of shoulder would be difficult to de-
ceive it was hard to imagine him
being affectionate but leclair who
knew the household had no doubts
on that score

  his imagination pictured the
foundry-master bending his flowing
grey moustache over renees grace-
ful neck caressing her with his
hands his ruddy visage congested
with desire and the picture caused
him a pang leclair in his owm
imagination was always the volup-
tuary who desires no more of love
than its physical concomitants but
in the past the search had brought
him more pain than delight and his
most glorious hours had been poi-
soned with a subtle venom

  he had arrived at ronceraies

  it was a beautiful place situated
about a league from the steel-mills
and outside the agglomeration of
workmens homes

  morain had acquired it from his
predecessor deram after having
accomplished the ruin of the latter-
by perfectly legal methods  of
course a little park running right
down to the river-bank surrounded
the house out here the comparative
rarity of the omnipresent factories
and the fact that the other buildings
were more widely spaced out per-
mitted one a view of a more distant
horizon but one which ended at last
in the blue smoke of the mills of
lourches through the calm water
of the escaut plowed the tugs with
their trains of loaded barges or oth-
er barges drawn by tractors which
moved along the bank

  in all this desert of steel and stone
the little park with its shadowy
vaults underneath the trees was one
of the sweetest oases leclair wrho
had a slight headache-his ears still
beat with the sound of the hammer
and his eyes were spotted by the too-
brilliant glare of the heated metal-
took a little walk before going up
to the house breathing with pleas-
ure the moist air from which the
river had washed the weight of dust
and smoke

in the smoking-room he found
selevine and morain a little later
m fontaine came in this scientist
thanks to the generosity of morain
had been able to prepare a work on
the microscopic structure of meteor-
ites which he hoped would unlock
the door of the institute for him a
solid friendship united him to the
foundry-master

  a passionate lover of astronomy
fontaine was particularly interest-
ed in the meteors whose fugitive
brilliance animates our nights he
achieved a fine detachment from all
that concerns this troubled globe of
ours as he contemplated those sud-
den streaks of light in the black
the death of ikon



silence of the night-sky or followed
the trails of fire of the distant comets
and the asteroids which the air de-
stroys as a candle snuffs out insects
-and he expressed this detachment
by wearing an old-fashioned neck-
tie of faded silk an indulgent skep-
tic he made no parade of his knowl-
edge  as a matter of fact he did not
even believe in the science to which
he gave his life following it only as
a kind of mental gymnastic a means
of diversion for a man on his way to
the grave

  he had a marked appreciation for
selevines caustic spirit and morain
never failed to invite the latter when
the scientist was to call

  always dressed in dark clothes
that accentuated the pallor of his
countenance selevine was more of-
ten silent than speaking neverthe-
less when drawn into some scientific
controversy or when anyone dared
to deny one of the ideas that were
his particular pets he threw himself
into the conversation with passion-


wonder story annual

ate ardor his knowledge was im-
mense though badly ordered and
his imagination though somewhat
disciplined by the methodical ger-
man training he had received often
drew him out of the straight road of
science into weird forests of fan-
tasy mo rain who at bottom thought
him a barbarian nevertheless appre-
ciated his practical achievements at
their full value

  in physics and above all on their
mathematical side he had carried
his studies far a follower of lubat-
chewsky and riemann familiar with
the work of the non-euclidean ge-
ometrists he frequently carried his
hearers with him out of range of
human perception and into the dis-
concerting regions of the fourth di-
mension where the astronomer in
spite of his interest in things new
and strange always refused to fol-
low on such occasions a smile would
play around selevines mouth then
becoming severely practical he
would discuss social questions de-
nouncing the iniquity of the rich and
the misery forced upon the workers
by capitalistic society he held with
tolstoi that modern civilization was
responsible for all the evils that
weigh upon humanity

  tonight he had engaged m fon-
taine in a discussion that both of
them found extremely interesting
for dr levysson and breval had ar-
rived and it was necessary to twice
send the butler to remind the dis-
putants that dinner was served

  the mistress of the huse came
down and all went to the table

  little lamps with silk shades shed
their soft light over the linen the
golden rays touched the hair of the
young matron and caressed the pure
and refined lines of her bare arms

  she did the honors of the table and
listened with a far-away smile to
the compliments of her neighbors
the doctor who rather fancied him-
self as a connoisseur of wine and
women and breval a well known
painter just back from a trip to the

united states

  the conversation at the beginning
of the dinner touched on this subject
and that but the inevitable shop-
talk came up at last

meanwhile leclair was watch-
ing with some annoyance as
dr levysson deployed all the graces
of an old beau bending toward his
charming hostess a face already
flushed with the first libations a
clang of silver woke the engineer
from his reverie he heard m fon-
taine saying

  my dear selevine the explana-
tion you give for the peculiarities in
your steels seems to me extremely
specious

  do you know levysson said
morain you have a singular neigh-
bor i presented selevine to you as
an engineer and the head of my
laboratories but he is less an engi-
neer than a philosopher and less a
philosopher than a nihilist he has
curious views on the subject of mat-
ter and some of his notions though
they are based on a solid mathemat-
ical foundation hark back to the al-
chemists of the middle ages he at-
tributes to metals a kind of life-
slower than our own but possessing
a dumb sense of feeling and a kind
of conscience in fact he thinks he
sees in metal all the manifestations
that characterize organized beings
but in a rudimentary state what do
you think about that

  the doctor wiped his lips and re-
plied with an air of profundity
yes a good many physicians
reason along these lines these days
they have been struck by certain
phenomena common in metallic mat-
ter and the living cell i think the
analogy is far-fetched after all it is
no more than a play on words

  a play on words exclaimed
morain dont you think that the
crystal is the specific form of matter
the mineral germ so to speak which
is born reproduces itself and fi-
nally dies
the death of iron-



  the doctor shook his head m
fontaine the thorough-going ma-
terialist added another argument

  boses has demonstrated that cer-
tain properties which were formerly
believed the exclusive characteristics
of living matter are also possessed
by metals take the fatigue of steel
for instance and the result of the
application of certain depressants
drugs and poisons belaieff a com-
patriot of selevines was the first to
speak of the inherited characteris-
tics of metals

  you are right agreed the rus-
sian the mechanical performance
of a metal depends upon its history
and the states it has already passed
through you can see it in the case
of certain carbon-steels made of
scrap which has been melted down
and which have already left behind
them five to ten generations of me-
tallic entity chemically identical to
the same steels made with fresh met-
als they are more capricious in per-
formance they undergo spontane-
ous evolutions the explanation i
offer of the breakage of those ma-
chines is not at all incredible in this
light

  its possible approved the foun-
dry-master  but i fear that these
conversations on mechanics are bor-
ing m breval

  the painter protested these
questions have a good deal of tech-
nical interest

  and considerable practical im-
portance replied morain nothing
that concerns iron should really
leave us indifferent isnt it the pri-
mordial element and in a sense ar-
mament of modern civilization no
one really considers how much in-
dustry can modify the habits the
life and the development of a race
it is necessary for centuries to pass
before the difference is really appre-
ciated in a few hundred years we
will know for the first time how
much steel for example has influ-
enced human evolution and they
will speak of our age as the age of

steel as we refer to the stone age
or the bronze age

  i hope put in levysson that
our distant grand-nephews wont
judge us solely by the uses we make
of a single metal no matter how es-
sential it is you see too many things
from the metallurgistss point of
view my dear morain what the
devil there are more important
things in the world the intelligence
of man-

  the intelligence of man inter-
rupted m fontaine is specifically
a manufacturing intelligence it has
no occupation but the creation of
artificial organs which complete and
supply the deficiencies of the human
machine which is the means of sup-
port for the intelligence and which
furnishes it with its means of ac-
tion the whole superiority of man
over the animal all the effort of the
human mind past and present is
comprehended in this-to invent and
construct tools and machines it is
only by means of matter that the su-
perior forms of life can conduct the
battle with matter and this conflict
will go on forever

there was a moment of silence
the clink of silver was audible
the flowers on the table seemed to ex-
hale a heavier perfume and the
thoughts of those present to become
more active

  selevine who seemed to be re-
garding the glass in which the bub-
bles coursed through his golden
wine with the most intense atten-
tion lifted his head

  why is it necessary to believe
that the human mind will always
need instruments and intermediaries
to manifest itself he asked who
knows what the future holds for us
whether in place of multiplying the
mechanisms interposed between our
bodies and the world we will not sim-
plify and do away with them there
are in man certain mental energies
which he has failed to use to the best
advantage only because of infirmi-

ties in his own nature or rather be-
cause he has always had some use-
ful and docile instrument at hand
he has continued to do the easiest
thing-that is something indus-
trial

  but what else could he do de-
manded breval in astonishment

  i mean to say that if evolution
had taken a different course human
activity would take place in the psy-
chic domain instead of the kingdom
of matter

  i am curious to know what would
have been the result of such a state
of affairs

  selevine smiled

  to make that out we would need
a different type of mind our men-
talities once they get beyond the
concrete flop about like fish out of
water

  dreams dreams said m fon-
taine wiping his glasses the fu-
ture belongs to the machine the ab-
solute monarchy of metal is at hand
even art must bow to it or perish

  the dinner had reached its end

  before his luxuriously appointed
table morain began to tell of his dif-
ficult early days with obvious pleas-
ure but levysson though pressed to
stay with him for a cigar made for
the smoking room

  in a corner of the salon leclair
was telling mme morain of epi-
sodes of his moroccan experience
two years before he had been en-
gaged in the construction of a hy-
draulic plant on the oum-er-rabis
where they had placed him in charge
of the native labor gangs he had
not liked it at the time but from a
distance the memory was pleasant

  i remember he said an arab
cafe with painted rooms and a court
paved with white stone the daugh-
ter of the proprietor powed us iced
liqueurs and burning-hot coffee her
fingers were painted carmine she
was covered with cheap jewelry and
her arms were bare she received all
the compliments addressed to her by
lowering remarkably thick eyelash-

es over very black eyes we all fell
in love with her but she was hunt-
ing for big game and our modest en-
gineers incomes were not sufficient
to offer any temptation

  i understand how you can be
homesick we cant offer you any
such unusual diversions here
leclair became more cheerful
the orient has a definite flavor
which it is difficult to forget thats
a trite remark but a true one at
the beginning of my stay here i was
tormented with regrets saddened by
the ugliness of things then  became
reconciled to denain your presence
had a good deal to do with this
change of attitude no dont smile
its no more than the truth you
cant know how much your friend-
ship represents to an orphan and
wanderer like myself

  then come to see us oftener
your father was my husbands best
friend is it necessary to remind you
that you are a friend of the family
the work in the factory interests
you

  certainly

  youre on good terms with sele-
vine now

  oh hes becoming humanized
at first he seems a difficult man to
figure out but in time one finds
agreeable spots in him he is subject
to savage fits which he tries to con-
ceal under an air of timidity he is
an inspired engineer who writes
poetry in figures without knowing
that he does it a rare specimen
his work has certainly not hurt
the factory

  but am i mistaken in thinking he
rather likes you

  mme morain burst into laughter
  oh what an idea

  she was still laughing when her
husband came back from the bil-
liard-room with levysson the doc-
tor who had won the game poured
into a glass a generous supply of
liqueur a species of medicine with
which he was accustomed to aid the
functions of an already excellent
the death of iron



digestion then all four rejoined
selevine and m fontaine the lat-
ter was saying

  no no old man i dont believe
that you will never escape from the
laws of life which demand the bad
as well as the good pain as well as
joy and the triumph of the strong
over the weak

  society taken as a mass is a
vast plastic organism whose struc-
ture depends like that of any living
body on the interplay of its own ele-
ments and the exterior forces it is
a human grouping which is trying
to realize by means of the methods
which it finds least repugnant the
obscure destinies of the race its
internal logic cannot contradict the
laws of economic evolution it is or-
ganized according to the conditions
peculiar to the age in such a man-
ner as to produce an equilibrium
among its diverse forces

a night shift

at a single bound the elevator
carried leclair to the top floor
of the factory there were concen-
trated all the offices and mechanical
departments little box-like rooms
opened on a corridor he entered a
door and found himself in a room
imprinted with the indefinable ugli-
ness which always surrounds the
frenchman at sedentary labor
around the walls were graphs and
tables of calculations a grey day
was reflected gloomily from the wall
of a neighboring building through
the dirty windows

  he got the current affairs of the
day out of the way ran through the
letters on the table and heard the
reports of the foremen

  martin the chief puddler drew
his attention to the bad quality of
the pigs from the last run they

gave steels which did not seem to
temper well short squat his rough
skin worn to a file-like texture near-
ly totally deafened from living con-
stantly where no voice could be heard
above that of the metal martin had
for long years stirred the blazing
pools of metal with his drawing-bar
and could tell the temperature of the
mass by visual observation alone as
he scrutinized it through half-closed
eyes

  he was continually kicking about
the modern progress which reduced
human initiative to a cipher substi-
tuting mechanical operations for
careful work the engineer aware
of his point of view smiled at his la-
borious explanations

  when he went down to the shops
he found the department heads mo-
mentarily idle because of the inter-
ruption of current discussing the
accident of the day before

  the event was ordinary enough
in itself but had been accompanied
by certain circumstances that
aroused general interest there was
a slight feeling of disorder through-
out the factory as though discipline
had given away at some point a feel-
ing strong enough to have been re-
marked by a stranger to the place

  at bottom most of the men in the
innocence of their hearts were glad
of this interruption in the daily toil
at the engineers table there had
been more drinking than usual that
was all if the spectacle of sudden ac-
cidental death can afflict us by call-
ing attention to the common destiny
of mortals on the other hand it aug-
ments the pleasure of our existence
our precious existence to know that
danger has struck someone else

  breaking off a peroration he was
delivering in the midst of a group
pillot approached leclair and inter-
rogated him in a nasal voice

  have you seen morain is it true
that he knows who did it

  dont joke put in valles a dry
little man with a dark skin and
black quick eyes


wonder story annual

  just the same replied the other
there are animals around here
quite capable of putting their ma-
chines out of order in the most ma-
licious way choleur spotted two
of them the other day communists
they called themselves they were
vowing vengeance as they left
hes a hard-boiled man that
choleur

   not at all protested pillot only
just revolutionary propaganda here
would upset the whole works at a
time like this over at anzin theyre
still getting out from under the re-
sults of the last strike and the lock-
out that went with it

  its possible said valles but
what does that prove when you
make an accusation like that you
ought to base it on absolute facts
until theres proof to the contrary
i refuse to admit that it was done
on purpose

  well these repeated accidents
   said pillot his clown-like face
wrinkled by the effort to think and
morain taking every word that gog-
gle-eyed pope in the laboratory says
as an article of faith everybody
admires what he doesnt understand
and selevine has the gift of compli-
cating the most simple things and
being ignorant with profundity
true your mistakes are so sim-
ple and obvious that they couldnt
hide behind a mountain when you
go wrong you do it with a sort of
terrible precision

  you know there is a reserve se-
ries of load fuses for triple pres-
sures it has never come into use
but once before and its extremely
difficult to bring it into use even
when youre trying well our pillot
here got it at the very first effort
and blew out all the fuses out of a
hundred possible combinations he
hit the worst one right at the start
isnt that wonderful

  the group laughed valles kept
on pitilessly

  marvelous the persistence with
which you manage to make mistakes

in defiance of all the laws of proba-
bility shows a talent which is really
remarkable even if it does more
work in the reverse direction
but keeping the alternators isnt
pillots job remarked leclair

  somebody had to take benoits
place and our friend who seizes on
every occasion to demonstrate his
universal competence offered his
services

  hows benoit coming on
  done for replied valles simply

there was a little silence le-
clair recalled the scene the man
stretched out face downward one
twisted foot escaped from his shoe
julien his face agonized kept re-
peating in a broken voice it wasnt
my fault i started the motor up
just as usual and then all at once-
benoit the wounded man was
screaming  he had understood
everything when he saw the dam-
aged wall the roof punctured by
the explosion of the casting women
had rushed in from the neighboring
street pressing around the victims
as they were carried out curious
over the sight of the blood deaf to
all remonstrances

  selevine had arrived quickly fol-
lowed by leclair his ordinarily pale
face had taken on a tint almost apop-
lectic julien explained that he had
started the big compound just as
usual the pressure was good the
governor functioning perfectly as
to the load it was limited to the task
of pulling the alternators at the
empty the machine had worked up
to its normal speed when suddenly
something snapped with a strident
scream a volley of iron had descend-
ed on the men fournier had been
killed on the spot and julien had
found himself flat on his back alive
only through a miracle

  lefevre seemed struck dumb his
lower lip hung limp he took it be-
tween two fingers and in twisting it
seemed to recover a portion of his
faculties now look here you must
the death of iron



have run it at over the regulation
speed you had a drink or two didnt
you naturally it wasnt your fault
you all say that well well see

  but the registering devices told
the story of a normal running of the
apparatus he tapped the glasses
over the registering drums the
devil he murmured heres a thin
undulating line and theres one with
a sharp break the accident unques-
tionably came at exactly nine
oclock i should have been here a
sudden flare of anger lit up the tiny
eyes in the midst of their pockets of
fat in the pudgy face

  did you think of verifying the
pressure no  dont doubt it you
were drunk why didnt you let me
know about it immediately you
dont know-you never know any-
thing are you the chief mechanic or
not stick around youre going to
see something

  hurrying to the directors office
he reported to morain

  nothing but an accident too
bad yes but like all the accidents of
 real consequence the turbine
will be repaired in three days i have
looked into the matter it was due to
the human factor again bad man-
agement negligence on the part of
-julien the fellow drinks ill get
things in order all right dont wor-
ry about that

  later leclair had learned from
lefevre that the percentage of
faulty manufactured articles from
the factory had tripled and that
three thousand pigs of iron had just
been refused by the archer firm
nevertheless the superintendent re-
fused to see any connection between
these occurrences

  the things theyre kicking
about he explained were turned
out by good workmen men ill guar-
antee personally you know for
some time the production has not
been as good as we would like is it
due to the poor quality of the raw
material or bad workmanship i
dont know anyway i promise you

not to let any wild stories like those
youve just been telling me get
around theres no use in magnify-
ing things

  lefevre is too obstinate to look
at the truth remarked pillot a lit-
tle later theyve got tullier to do
the investigating if he fihds any-
thing i deserve to be hung you have
never seen him imagine a kind of
deformed giant with a little head
shaped like a rabbits he has a mind
full of fur an idiot by construc-
tion

  and leaping from one subject to
another he went on

  have you ever seen mme mo-
rain  she went across the court just
now elegant and boy-what a fig-
ure  and dressed she was going to
see benoits wife over at the co-
operative selevine was with her
naturally he has all the chances in
the world that chap

  maybe he deserves them
phooey hell never make the
boss a cuckold anyway someone
else has beat him to it as for sele-
vine id let him take my sister out
you know with women-

selevine halted before an elec-
trical machine his experienced
ear had caught an anomaly in its
rhythm without his intelligence be-
ing able to assign any definite rea-
son for this feeling from its heart
of copper and iron energy flowed
along the cables like some mysteri-
ous blood-stream on a marble pan-
el nearby were circular dials where
needles told the story of this passage
of disciplined forces

  by contrast the depths of the foun-
dry were sunk in impenetrable shad-
ows selevines eyes took in the de-
tails of a decauville track and then
gradually accustomed themselves to
the obscurity into which he was gaz-
ing along the ground floor were
ranges of completed castings of raw
minerals of slag and vitrified cin-
ders in the storeroom piles of bar
steel gathered coal-dust an inde-
	wonder story annual

finable odor the production of chem-
ical reduction and mineral ferments
filled the place monsters undergo-
ing their period of gestation were
there larval forms drawn frbm the
depths of the earth waiting for the
arrival of the creative forces which
would bring them to life

  a pyrometric laboratory had been
reserved for his work he rejoiced
over the prospect of laboring there
without disturbance on the black-
board half-effaced figures deployed
their columns of arabesques the
calcined stub of his pipe was bitter
on his lips his thoughts became ex-
traordinarily clear and a sudden
enthusiasm seized upon him for a
little while he busied himself with
various crucibles imagined momen-
tarily that he had recovered his hap-
py vein of a few days before but he
tired rapidly and turned to the
transcription of a complex chemical
reaction for a respite in vain the
figures would not come and sleep
clutched at his brain

  in accordance with morains wish-
es he had taken over the duty of
superintending the factory for the
night there was a steel contract to
be fulfilled with stiff penalties at-
tached to it and although the brok-
en machines had been replaced pro-
duction had fallen off to such a point
lately that it had become necessary
to work day and night luckily he
enjoyed night work he pursued his
studies to the hour of false dawn and
then pressing his face against the
window he had seen the last lights
wink out and had returned to his
books with renewed energy delight-
ed to find his mental powers so clear
his intelligence so active in the
midst of a sleeping world such
hours are rich with meditation

  he took a few quick steps to and
fro to warm himself they had for-
gotten to light up the gas radiators
and a glacial humidity mounted from
the earth a little shiver went
through him and he felt a tightened
sensation in his chest the memory

 of the pain it awoke had the effect
 of discouraging him

   he had strained his constitution
 too far these last months and his
 body demanded a rest with some
 bitterness he remembered his sickly
 adolescence when a similar lassitude
 had paralyzed his efforts the desire
 for a kind of animal repose swept
 over him he remembered the con-
 valescent hospital where he had
 spent a good deal of his time it was
 a place of roses without savor
 bounded by a horizon of low hills

   a bell rang he experienced a cer-
 tain annoyance that animal of a
 martin he thought if hed only
 just once get out of his difficulties by
 himself he hung up the telephone
 but his reverie was broken and he
 decided to go out

   the events of two days ago still
 bothered the men causing them to
 gather in little groups of two and
 three and make an elaborate pre-
 tence of being busy when selevine
 entered the shop someone explained
 that the failure of the power kept
 them from doing anything the sup-
 v ply of current being so low that the
 tools refused to bite when they en-
 gaged the whirling masses of metal

 something had gone wrong with
 the main dynamo installation it
 vibrated with lessened speed in its
 cage of iron beneath the glare of a
 screened light the bronze fittings
 the mass of wires the buzzing mov-
 ing parts threw off little sparkles of
 light an electrician in overalls and
 wooden shoes was already at work
 but his little tricks did not seem to
 be having their usual success he
 changed the carbons verified the
 contact points went to examine the
 dials and returned in a meditative
 mood selevine had the smoking dy-
 namo stopped and hooked up an
 emergency power unit

   the electric furnace also was not
 working well and had to be exam-
 ined before he could return to his
 office
  at three oclock he returned to the
shop two arc lights were burning
feverishly as though insects with
flame-like wings had been captured
in their globes and the silence of the
night was disturbed bv a medley of
sounds veiled flood-lights illumi-
nated a corner of a tower a polished
cylindrical surface a man with a
sharp face was order in af mechanics
about someone shuffled dast on
silent feet an oil-can in his hand a
comet-like trail of stars issued from
a grinding machine at work on some
instrument

  the engineer seated himself in the
little look-out post belonging to the
foreman by lifting his eyes he could
see the stars through the windows
like another trail of fire-dust punc-
tuating the vault of heaven out
there the gods were dead and only
an immense nothingness filled the
void of cold and silence

  sometimes selevine imagined that
in the industrial city which sur-
rounded him he saw only the matrix
from which the future world would
rise he admired the restless energy
the indomitable will of man pursu-
ing his dream of pride and grandeur
amid the terrors of a quaking planet
   but more often the futility of
all effort was apparent

  at five oclock in the morning the
first gang prepared to leave

  a day will come thought sele-
vine when the last tree will perish
on an earth sterilized by the efforts
of the human race then in place of
flowers and forests we shall see
nothing but steely architecture lift-
ing its towers swinging its enor-
mous vertebrae and complicated
skeletons across the horizon

  suddenly jets of steam leaped
from the roofs of the factories and
out of a thousand throats issued
strident whistles the distance woke
to a chorus of metallic cries it
seemed to selevine that here he
heard the true voice of the city
plaintive and heart-rending

  it always cried out thus amid the
tenderness of the dawn at the hour

ness hesitated on the threshold of

the new day it was a denial of his
aspiration toward extinction as an
escape from a burden too great to be
borne day followed day the same
men went through the same ges-
tures without conviction and toiled
in the monotonous round in which
their sons would toil

  the powerful voices meanwhile
glorified the industry of iron and fire
as it extended its empire over the
earth proclaiming its pitiless law
that the efforts of men to escape
were vain and would break against
the very instruments he had de-

a new accident

rpwo months had passed the cast-
a ings from the morain company
were showing so many defects that
a number of clients in spite of re-
duced prices and payments made in
advance were cancelling their or-
ders the government was more in-
dulgent but the necessary oiling of
official channels threatened to absorb
all the profits

  after a careful investigation mo-
rain had reached the conclusion that
he was the victim of some sort of
revolutionary plot in which the per-
sonnel of his factory had a part and
with some particular object in view

  guards were placed in the various
departments and a sleepless vigil was
kept but it was all in vain

  more than the destruction itself
the mystery of how if had been
brought about disturbed morain al-
though he had studied the weakened
sections under selevines guidance
with the most minute attention he
had failed to acquire any clear idea
of the method that would produce
such results these modifications of
the texture of the metal itself these

dry dusty knots encysted in the
mass some of them imperceptible to
the naked eye and others as big as
walnuts these cinder-like stains
sometimes black and sometimes blue
running through the steel seemed to
have been produced by a process un-
known to modern science

  a certain intuition suggested to
him that he was in the presence of
facts to which the classical formulae
of the engineer could not be applied
but he repulsed this idea as the prod-
duct of an overheated imagination
and raged through the same investi-
gations for the hundredth time

  in despair he again appealed to
the authorities to give him protec-
tion the earlier inquiry by the po-
lice having produced no result in-
spector tullier did not wish to bother
with the matter any further he
sent two detectives along using the
ordinary police methods they suc-
ceeded in actually catching a man in
the act of sabotage but when morain
had interrogated the frightened little
fellow with troubled eyes sodden
with alcohol he became convinced
that the serious troubles in the fac-
tory had certainly never originated
with such a rat

  the arrest of the workman made
a good deal of talk in the city never-
theless and at the factory itself
there were some who defended his
actions lefevre getting wind of
this spirit drew up a list of the
workmen who were affiliated with ex-
tremist political parties a few were
dismissed rewards were offered for
tale-bearing and a flood of anony-
mous letters poured into the office
one of them denounced julien laval
in the most energetic terms

  a search-warrant resulted in the
discovery of numerous pieces of
propaganda and letters from differ-
ent revolutionary groups at his
house although he had a fairish
reputation in the factory up to this
time he was instantly dismissed and
ten others with him the workers
sent a delegation to plead for them
the death of iron



but morains decision was an in-
flexible one

                    

marked down as an agitator
lav could find no other job in
the district fanny in a sudden ac-
cess of sympathy and passion for
her lover turned over most of her
salary to him

  he trailed from saloon to saloon
throughout denain finding in alcohol
a consolation for his sorrows and
delivering tirades against his former
employer from time to time he
would have fits of anger in this
mood he beat his mistress with en-
thusiasm rut fanny weeping only
loved him all the more for his bru-
tality

  selecting a time when leclair was
alone in the laboratory she begged
him to intercede for her lover but
the engineer annoyed by her plead-
ing repulsed her with some rude-
ness

  julien she said to him is in-
capable of a really bad action lies
just weak thats all his only fault
has been that he listened to that sele-
vine hes the one whos really at
the bottom of the whole business
youll tell monsieur morain wont
you    monsieur raymond

  well

  you werent always like this
someones been telling you things
about me

 but-

  i knew it and naturally you
believed every word they said youre
as blind as you can be and the others
are just as bad when i think how
they look all over for the guilty per-
son without the idea ever occurring
to them that   well they ought to
look a little nearer home thats all

  what are you trying to say

  you wouldnt believe me anyway
whats the use listen monsieur
raymond ive been watching for a
long while  nobody ever pays any
attention to me naturally ive been
watching that russian yes sele-

vine please dont go-yet i must
tell you about this

    ive kept it quiet for a long while
 im only an ignorant woman but i
 have eyes like the rest of you and i
 know how to use them in the eve-
 ning after the shop closes up ive
 seen him o all around the machines
 hed walk up to them and poke into
 them here and there with those long
 skeleton fingers of his tve even felt
 those fingers on me yes on my body
 but im not the kind of girl that
 gives herself to every man that
 comes alon im scared of that an-
 archist besides lie got julien fired
 and hell do for all of us yet tell
 monsieur morain about it before its
 too late

   she stamped her foot

   ah if i could only persuade you
 to put the others on their guard but
 hes got himself into everyones con-
 fidence hes bewitched everybody in
 the world even monsieur morain and
 his wife the damned foreigner
 fanny looked up and then came
 closer to leclair looking into his
 eyes a burst of enraged merriment
 filled her throat and she said rapid-
 ly

   oh you didnt know that before
 you came mme morain was in the
 laboratory quite frequently they
 worked together no doubt-it was
 really charming you really should-
 nt have come to interrupt their little
 idyll

   youre a fool

   he sent her away reproaching
 himself for having listened to such
 silly chatter

   nevertheless it made a consider-
 able impression on his mind certain
 little things to which he had never
 paid any attention oddities in sele-
 vines conduct came back to his
 memory the surly fits to which the

	russian was subject irritated him
 more than ever although he could
 place no definite reason for it he
 avoided speaking to him aside from

toward the middle of december
the pace of events became more
rapid the lathe-men had to stop
work their tools no longer bit in
spite of frequent grinding with the
planes and milling machines it was
the same story then following the
trouble with the special alloys of the
machine tools the machines them-
selves the castings of their bases
were attacked

  a leprosy seemed to run through
the compact tissues

  the steel machines one by one got
themselves out of order the work-
men hesitated to approach those still
in operating condition fearing to
have them suddenly explode into a
hundred murderous fragments un-
der their hands

  pillot came to lefevre one day
with the news that two mechanics
had refused to make an urgently
needed repair on a motor while it
was in operation

  go do it yourself said lefevre

  mm-m  it isnt as though
there were any real danger    for
men who know how to do the job

  lefevre looked at him sidelong

  its up to the heads to set the
example monsieur pillot we cant
have any cowards around here

  the next day pillot turned in his
resignation and two other engineers
valles and gallois followed his ex-
ample-for the good of the profes-
sion their departure made a bad
impression in the shop and a series
of alarming rumors ran through it
like wildfire

  the more timorous spirits would
have left also but the fear of being
without work detained them fore-
seeing the approaching ruin of the
firm and a long period of unemploy-
ment before them they told tales of
woe to anyone who would hear them

  a few old grumblers who had
spent their lives over the benches
regretted the loss of the familiar ma-
chines others rejoiced without
knowing why nudging and winking

 at each other when the owner of the
 factory passed by morose and silent

   morain was oak in the course
 of his career he had been through
 numberless conflicts and surmounted
 difficulties out of which his charac-
 ter so far from bending emerged
 with renewed strength but the mys-
 tery with which he had been grap-
 pling this battle against unseen
 forces was bringing him down fast

   exhausted by work he found the
 cares of the day disturbing his
 nights as well the energy to resist
 the suggestions of fear was some-
 how lacking

   what did they want of him any-
 way to make him shut up his shops
 and turn more than a thousand work-
 men into the street could he do
 anything to take the edge from this
 vindictive hatred if at least he
 could have counted on the fidelity of
 the engineers but suspicion and
 jealousy divided even their ranks
 lefevre with his self-sufficiency his
 sterile activity was futile chou-
 leurs brutality became accentuated
 at the very moment when patience
 and discretion were most needed and
 upset even his own subordinates
 with his suspicion and clumsy sur-
 veillances selevines science was at
 fault he avoided the director and
 spent all his time in the laboratory
 while raymond leclair was incapa-
 be of accomplishing anything that
 demanded the slightest concentra-
 tion and did nothing but think up
 the wildest of ideas

   for some time in fact leclair had
 suffered from some indefinite disease
 of the spirit that put a term to his
 activity incessant headaches seemed
 to press on his temples he had
 noted a slight red rash on his hands

 and had attributed it to the influence
 of the furnaces to which he must
 have come too near

   as though in a constant dream he
 heard the confused murmur of the
 factory the movement of the fires
 held him spellbound and a kind of
the death of iron



 stupor sapped his powers

one evening- he was crossing the
department where the first acci-
dents had taken place it had been
closed off to the workmen two elec-
tric lights burned feebly and as luck
would have it both went out at the
moment when lecair was passing
through certain machines glittered
feebly tiny luminous specks starred
the granulated surfaces of the
breaks while the polished surfaces
seemed to be reflecting light from
some invisible source the engineer
made a mental comparison with the
fox-fires in certain marshes he
thought at first that he was the vic-
tim of some optical illusion some
curious trick of reflection but at a
distance from the windows and in
the shadow of his cupped hands the
luminescence persisted it was pres-
ent in every dark corner of the room

  it was seven in the evening

  the grilled windows held rectan-
gles of indigo and the moribund
lights flashed redly

  a dull noise could be heard in the
distance but all else was silence le-
clair felt somewhat unbalanced by
this unusual quiet

  certain facts he had witnessed
now took on a new significance they
were inked by curious similarities
under the shadow of this remarkable
phenomenon invisible currents radi-
ating from some impending catas-
trophe seemed to have perverted the
instincts of the animals about the
place rats had been seen leaving
the basement where iron was stored
and invading the upper floors lights
had appeared in the store-room at
night

  his imaginative eyes seemed to
see in the forms of the machines
about him the vague shapes of mon-
sters ready to tear him to pieces

  he felt the weight of his recent
lassitude his head whirled never-
theless he continued toward the
neighboring department where a

steam engine was housed about him
the forms of heavy levers made fan-
tastic patterns in the gloom

  a faint sound was audible

  it seemed to come from one who
was sick or tortured his heart beat-
ing rapidly leclair listened but all
was silent again

  turning to go he heard the stifled
cry once more it seemed to him that
it came from the passage that ran
along beside the big engine some-
one hurt 

  by means of the little ladder
placed there for the purpose the en-
gineer reached the base of the ma-
chine

   the uncertain light of a single bulb
projected long moving shadows at
the bottom of the narrow space lay
a man his face to the ground

  leclair recognized the form of
selevine

  he seemed to have lost conscious-
ness two fingers breadth from his
head the massive fly-wheel was mov-
ing and the connecting rods moved
back and forth like sabres to the
rhythm of the piston

   not without difficulty leclair suc-
ceeded in moving him from his dan-
gerous position and ran to get help
the quitting whistle had long since
sounded and the infirmary was
empty but he managed to find a
first-aid kit and hastened back

  his head moving feebly from side
to side his lips colorless the rus-
sian had half-opened his eyes and
was breathing with difficulty

  a woman brought a basin of water
and washed the bloody head be-
hind her appeared two or three em-
ployees held late at the factory for
some reason or other finally an
ambulance arrived and took away the
wounded engineer

  a little later leclair was explain-
ing to m morain

  some moving part of the engine
must have hit him the floor is very
oily and uneven and he must have
slipped
	wonder story annual

  but what was he doing- there at
such an hour

  leclair hesitated a suspicion rose
within him finally he told part of
his conversation with fanny he had
attached no importance to it at first
but it was hard to overlook certain
siflspicious facts

  oh thats absurd exclaimed
morain the more i think about it
the more any idea of human inter-
vention in the phenomena we have
witnessed seems infantile there are
breakages of machines and tools over
at the richard factory too barrois
cant see anything in them but a
series of fortuitous accidents its
impossible but if they were found
to have a similar origin what would
you say

  but how can anyone conceive-
oh it will all clear up and quite
soon im convinced dont make rash
judgments my boy above all when
it comes to accusing people of things
like that

  raymond reddened and was silent

vi

the conspirators meet

the next morning morain went
over to levyssons clinic where
selevine had been installed in a bed
with his head swathed in bandages
the engineer lay with closed eyes

  the doctor had not yet been able
to make a diagnosis of his patients
condition and was troubled by the
coma that had followed the delirium
of the night before he told how at
the height of his fever the injured
man had cried out against the ghosts
produced by his own fevered brain
  it is the death of iron he had
cried in a hoarse voice we must
stop it    too late everythings
going to hell    everythings done
for

  i had to use an opiate said levy-
sson the poor chap was much im-
pressed by the events that have tak-
en place at the factory and his delir-
ium took this particular form accord-
ingly as a matter of fact such a
series of accidents has never hap-
pened before there have been bad
breaks at the richard and at the
general tool companys factories
and more recently at archers my
clinic is full of injured workmen i
have heard that its all due to an
organized program of intimidation
directed against the heads of the in- 
dustry what do you think the
authorities have at last decided to
suppress the populaire theres a
warrant out for totti naturally the
metal workers union is protesting
my dear man i must get along
morain interrupted with a touch of
asperity let me know how sele-
vine comes along i beg you

  getting into his auto he had him-
self driven back to the factory

  as soon as he arrived he encoun-
tered lefevre wearing an expression
of complete despair the giant over-
head crane which served the besse-
mer converters was out of order one
of the tracks on which it moved had
broken under its wheels

  when he reached the shop the me-
chanics had already put some shor-
ing under the apparatus but the
craife bowed sidewise and threatened
to fall at any moment

  well have to get it across the
gap ah the motor is wedged but
then- chouleur where is chou-
leur cried morain

  and turning round he almost hur-
tled into a workman and then per-
ceived for the first time that the
others were massed around in a semi-
circle their noses turned upward
clear out you get going

  the group dispersed giving way to
the breakdown gang with jacks and
pinch bars some climbed up to where

the populaire is the french communist
newspaper
the death of iron



the overhead track ran while others
rigged a sort of emergency scaffold-
ing and set up blocks and tackles a
dozen hands seized a rope their
rhythmic efforts made the muscles
on their powerful arms bulge out and
the veins in their necks glowed blue
their chests expanded but the great
mass jammed in its position re-
fused to move

   therefore at all costs it was nec-
essary to take the weight off the sup-
ports

   lefevre proposed the establish-
ment of a temporary connection with
the roofgirders would they be
strong enough  everybody discussed
the question together morain mop-
-ped a moist forehead hesitated and
calculating apprehending the immi-
nent fall of the machine a few min-
utes more than nothing could stop it

   in his brain the contending forces
ranged themselves in ordered se-
quences he calculated their strength
and their direction the resistance of
the supports

   with a gesture he called for si-
lence

   chouleur come here were go-
ing to turn over the motor of the
crane after hitching chains to one of
the gallery columns do you under-
stand  the crane will haul itself up
on its own chain by wedging it as
it moves we can make it pivot in the
right direction

   its risky

   no other way out quick one of
you men get up there and make the
connections winter

  its-a-

   youre scared marchal up with
you my boy

  the person addressed an agile
adolescent peeled off his vest ran
rapidly up the steep ladder and
working along a girder dropped to
the desk of the crane he moved with
caution at first then became ab-
sorbed in his work the windlassing
arrangement was established some-
thing clanged there was a blue
spark

someone swore fervently then
for an instant there was an elec-
tric pause an unstable and menacing
silence chouleur lifted his head and
stood like a man enchanted

  look out stop cried the men
flowing like a tide around morain
carrying him with them bumping
into each other

   in the middle of the emptied space
a trembling seized one of the an-
chors there was a crack then an
exasperated squeal of metal some-
one leaped awkwardly from above
the great crane began to slide gir-
ders and chains cracked apart one
after another like threads the dis-
tended links gave way with a clear
ringing sound

  and down it came with a thun-
der that shook the great hall of the
foundry twenty tons of steel crashed
to the ground and from the dust-
cloud that rose round the wreck
came cries piteous appeals

  that blue thing there under the
mass of torn girders could it be the
broken body of a man morain did
not want to look at it but he saw
with the greatest clearness what
could have been done his mind as
though unwilling to believe the evi-
dence of his eyes continued to work
out a solution now become useless
when a sound made him look around
with a voiceless cry like that of a
wounded beast a man was brandish-
ing under his nose the crumpled rem-
nant of- a hand from which several
fingers had been torn and shouting
at him

  you dirty rat you did that

  the man looked at the blood al-
most stupidly then his pain coming
home to him he pawed at morains
garments his eyes wild his lips
foaming before anyone could inter-
vene a hostile circle had formed
around the owner of the factory

  pushed overwhelmed he tried to
make himself heard but the tumult
drowned his voice he was menaced
insulted from all sides neverthe-

less there were a few voices raised to
defend him martin stood against
the crowd telling them to be calm
with his great rolling voice morain
saw lefevre terror-stricken crouch-
ing behind a machine chouleur
brandished a wrench and shouted
the first man who comes near me
the first and then suddenly col-
lapsed as a bolt thrown from some-
where struck him squarely in the
forehead

  the hostile circle tightened
clenched hands were lifted a wom-
an in a torn dress screamed impre-
cations morain recognized her and
thought dumbly what that old
fool too a hand tore at his coat
another struck him on the ear ah
you pups ill make you pay for this
he thought of pitiless revenges he
would inflict there was a whistling
sound the smoke suddenly lifted
and the acrid odor of a fire-extin-
guisher reached his nostrils he felt
his strength give out he was only
a tired old man in whom all sense
of authority was dead

  but already hands were lifting
him others were brushing off his
dirtied clothes he perceived some-
thing like a softening of the wills
hostile to his a quick melting of
their anger around him there were
undecided movements the last ef-
fects of anger trying to keep itself
alive employees were pouring from
the neighborhood offices lefevre
dragged himself to a telephone
voices rose against the anonymous
aggressors everyone disclaiming re-
sponsibility the rebellion died out
suddenly and the old habit of obe-
dience was reasserted

  a gendarme appeared a revolver
conspicuously belted to his hip

  amid scenes of authority reborn
aid for the injured was organized

  leaning on leclairs shoulder mo-
rain left the building unable to hear
anything but the drum-iike beating
of his own heart

  leclair is right thought morain

that luminescence came from the
steel itself

crossing the laboratory he
pulled the curtains closer to-
gether and came back to look at the
testing table the atrocious vision of
the man crushed before his very
eyes the day before returned in the
darkness but he managed to dismiss
it

  he examined the fragment of steel
once more taken from one of the
first machines to break down it
seemed to have been rubbed all over
with phosphorous the little dusty
spots the stains noted two months
before seemed to have multiplied
no treatment he knew of would pro-
duce such results in metal

  morain felt that he had touched
the heart of the problem and the ex-
citement of the research man on the
threshold of a great discovery
gripped him a confused idea that
until now he had hardly formulated
began to clarify itself in his mind

  the effects he had seen in his fac-
tory could not be classified with any
known series of phenomena they
were the special results of some new
type of energy acting on the matter

  a certain emotion dried his throat
and he repeated in a low voice and
with lips that barely moved the
words selevine had pronounced in his
delirium the malady the death of
iron

  yes that was it a contagion run-
ning through the agglomerations of
steel and propagating itself from one
piece of metal to another his rea-
son reeled before so incredible a con-
clusion

  the method of transmission was
doubtless through- some metallic
dust imperceptible crystallizations
whose dimensions barely exceeded
those of the germs which carry the
diseases that attack living beings
these germs attacking healthy met-
al would engender others of the same
species all radiating outward from
the death of iron	

the point where they struck

  repeated shocks and vibration no
doubt increased the effect for it was
in the machines subject to the great-
est amount of vibration that the dis-
ease had operated most violently
selevine without discovering the
true cause for the disease had suc-
ceeded in explaining its progress

  further observations reinforced
this conviction and curious to re-
late the certainty that the trouble
was not due to enemies but to phys-
ical causes no matter how remark-
able had the result of reassuring the
iron magnate

  after the brief bending of his will
now that the peril was known he
recovered all his energy the man of
steel felt that chance had thrown a
new and fascinating study in his
way one that he might even turn to
some practical advantage

  at least he could defend himself
save his factory his fortune-his
lifes work he made plans felt him-
self imbued with new activity

  forthwith he summoned lefevre
and traced out for his benefit the
main lines on which the struggle
would be carried forward specialists
were to be retained for the cleaning
up and renewal of the damaged ma-
chines  production was to be speeded
up and thus the alarmed rumors
which threatened the credit of the
company would be stilled

  the chief accountant submitted a
series of calculations he had just
drawn up the losses were less seri-
ous than morain had at first thought
he suggested turning the product of
the piennes mines over to the regie
of azincourt before the quality of
the mineral produced became gen-
erally recognized as bad or else ex-
changing them against realizable
coal properties as soon as possible

  the archer firm would advance
two million in credit but only after
an inquiry that could not fail to
throw discredit on the factory mean-
while the exchange of properties

could be carried through in secrecy

  after glancing over these propos-
als morain resolved to see mr rar-
rois of the archer firm and tell him
of his new hypothesis he considered
him the best metallurgist he knew
after selevine

  as it was already past twelve and
he was hungry he dropped in at a
little restaurant instead of going
home for lunch

  the communists of the district
met there most of the time the
proprietor a man named beutier
passed as one of the most ardent
devotees of their party as a matter
of fact he had certain discreet rela-
tions with the employers organiza-
tions and passed valuable informa-
tion along to them from time to
time not because he was really in
favor of capitalism but because of
his wife a good-looking woman who
was extremely fond of jewelry and
whose virtue was in proportion to
his presents made to her

recognizing the foundry-mas-
ter beutier led them into a little
room at one side and waited on him
personally through the crack in the
door morain could observe the bar-
room in front of the bar and with
their backs to him a group of work-
men were talking

  the nervousness the uneasiness
of these usually placid men struck
him forcefully a man from the
archer factory was reporting that a
heavy load breaking loose from the
wire rope that raised it had injured
another worker by his side it was
the fifth accident of the kind that
had occurred there the iron in the
place seemed to have become brittle

  an old man with white hair opined
that for some time an evil influence
seemed to have been thrown over the
factory where every day there were
more injured and remarked that the
doctors of the insurance companies
backed by the capitalists were re-
fusing to pay the full amounts of in-


wonder story annual

jury benefits

  thereupon everybody began to
talk at once a young fellow clad in
the blue jumper of a mechanic
banged on the bar warmed with his
libations he launched into a speech
denounced the capitalists as the ones
to blame declaring that it was a
monstrous conspiracy to produce de-
fective goods so they could dismiss
a number of the workers and replace
them with more submissive charac-
ters they were organizing a kind
of gigantic lock-out

  with the agreeable sensation of
having said something fine he sat
down and drained off a glass of wine
at a single gulp

  at the richard factory morain
found his friend in conference with
camus one of the directors

  ah youve come at the right mo-
ment said barrois i wanted to
see you as in the other factories
we have been having curious acci-
dents here it is essential that we
take some measures against these
strikes and this sabotage before they
ruin our indutry

  morain told how he had envisaged
the manner in which the enfeeble-
ment of the steels had taken place
piling proof on proof but without in
the least carrying conviction to his
audience

  camus was frankly skeptical

  its silly he said nothing but
imagination an epidemic of metal
no-what shall i say -an epimetal-
lic if i didnt know you id think
you were joking but no one ever
heard of such a thing

  i should say not replied morain
in a voice so decided that the other
was silenced for a moment

  theres an idea in it just the
same turn a neat profit in the mar-
ket you havent said anything about
it to anyone else have you good
if i were certain    anyhow it
doesnt matter whether you have the
right idea or not afterward there
is always plenty of time   

  the big man stopped pacing the
floor momentarily pensive

  yes yes-a few whispers here
and there    the papers  to
create a certain atmosphere take
our positions upsetthe markets a
little and then-the grand coup
he banged his fist on the table

  morain bit his lips already regret-
ting that he had spoken he had been
unable to resist the temptation to
astonish his companions by a sensa-
tional revelation he felt himself
baffled in the face of camus view of
the situation the old fool is right
at that he thought his mind enter-
ing on the train of speculation on the
profits that might result but camus
would be sure to claim the lions
share his heart filled with hatred
for the other but he managed a
smile as he said

  i dont want this hypothesis
made too public

  why not

  im by no means certain of the
facts yet and would prefer to study
the phenomenon and the methods of
dealing with it first

  oh thats reasonable enough
science ah youre a lucky man
morain to be able to give your time
to abstract research but youre
right well pardon me but i must
be getting along

  from the doorway he nodded to
barrois but the latter lost in his
own reflections failed to notice the
gesture

vii

the disease spreads

oh we have the best kind of
guarantees affirmed morain
or i wouldnt have considered the
matter

  engulfed in one of the big arm-
chairs which the director of the
the death of iron



foundry affected as giving an air of
elegance to business barrois exam-
ined his fingernails with attention

  afid bey is a swine he de-
clared hell accept delivery of the
rails and then find some pretext for
refusing payment now there will
be no lack of pretexts as you know
they wont last six months

  but if theyre made of duro-
fer you notice that the contract
doesnt specify and i have pre-
ferred to cut the profits a little bit
and give him something safe

  the engineer repressed a smile
leclair who was present at the
interview observed that they pos-
sessed an option on the zettat phos-
phate deposits if there are any
difficulties levasseur will back us
up hes a friend of mine and has
a strong pull with fhe governor
there will be a few handouts to
make but thats all in the game in
morocco

  well ill think it over said
barrois just now im bothered
with more urgent questions the
siderosis is progressing rapidly in
my shop the castings were at-
tacked about eight days ago most
of the motors have broken down i
dont know how to do anything in
the midst of all the complaints
were getting

  i have mentioned this sickness of
iron to my metallurgists most of
them are simply incredulous just
the same they are all working like
the devil but the workmen are
kicking and we can get production
out of them only with the greatest
difficulty they say the steel has
gone rotten and thats explanation
enough

  and what do your department
heads say asked morain

  gautier and samuel have been
looking into the question for several
days gautier lost a lot of money at
baccarat recently but otherwise he
feels he hasnt a thing to worry
about whether its clumsiness or
deliberate sabotage he said none

of it would have happened if our
foremen were any good i tried to
talk the blue devil to him but he
took it as a joke in bad taste well
you see i couldnt insist after a
minute or two of silence he and
samuel told me i needed a rest
faith if my whole pile wferent sunk
in the business i would keep my
mouth shut and get out

  morain recounted the similar
scene which had taken place in his
office when conrad the manager of
the douchy mines and one of the
leading figures in the industry had
to come to him to ask him the
reason for the rumors that were go-
ing about in vain he had demon-
strated to this influential man that
the trouble was engendered and had
developed without human interpo-
sition according to a process still
obscure he had encountered a man
resolutely determined not to under-
stand

  he reproached me with having
tolerated selevine in my factory and
said he had discovered pierre
was a propogandist for revolution-
ary ideas well you know how it is
with selevine

  i think hes too intelligent to be
sincere about his notions and i have
never attached the slightest impor-
tance to mere words hes a bit
proud too i had no choice i had
to get rid of him or shut my eyes to
his opinions and i took the latter
solution as the more practical one
for his services were really indis-
pensible the whole question is so
delicate that we cant be too care-
ful but i put tullier on the job
and he is making certain discreet
inquiries

  do you know in one of sele-
vines letters we found a reference
to the siderosis at a date when we
didnt even suspect its existence
his observations helped consider-
ably in pointing the way to the
truth and how can we explain his
attitude to conrad without accus-
ing him finally a factory girl

claims to have seen him taking a
piece of sick iron into the store-
room where it was found later
tell me morain have you made
any new experiments

  yes and they all confirm what
we know in a general way i have
worked with sterilized irons sub-
jected to high temperatures the
transmission of the disease can take
place without direct contact and
through a solid screen

  there was a knock at the door of
the office and a secretary entered
presenting a special-delivery letter
to the foundry master

  its from malet he said after
having glanced over it he wants
me to come to a manufacturers
meeting tomorrow landry arrived
at valenciennes yesterday confer-
ences talking inquiring and re-
ports i can see it all in advance

agitation which will gradually be
transmitted through a hundred de-
partments and die out eventually
smothered in red tape and mean-
while our factories are collapsing
like houses of cards

leclair who was bored alleged
an appointment and went out
on his way to bellevue he met

mme morain just getting out of
her car and hastened his steps she
was wearing a fur coat that made a
frame about her face and her eyes
seemed less grey than violet under
the blue of the sky

  raymond experienced a pang of
emotion at the touch of her little
gloved hand a certain joy seemed
to penetrate his whole being it
seemed to him that the young
woman made the whole country-
side look better he asked permis-
sion to walk with her as far as ron-
ceraies

  it was the soft sweet hour of twi-
light lights had begun to wink on
in the distance the city slept as
though in the smoke of a thousand
funeral touches

  near the escaut they were con-
scious of the fresh smell of the
water mingled with the odors of
earth and dead leaves it was as
though a perfume of gentle death
mounted from the rivers grey
tomb carrying to those who felt it
a wave of sadness all the surround-
ing country was outlined in sharp
relief and had a certain serenity of
aspect like that on the faces of
those who have died young

  leclair asked his companion what
her plans for the winter were was

she going to the riviera

  pensive she did not reply re-
marking for the first time that she
seemed preoccupied he asked the
reason

  she confessed to a certain un-
easiness

  the socialist papers are attack-
ing my husband so they say he is
responsible for the crisis and that
hes starving the unemployed yes-
terday he was booed as he left the
factory monteuil is backing the
movement hes a terrible man
a fanatic the communists try
to make campaign material out of
everything that happens were
used to them and im really sur-
prised that you attach any impor-
tance to their futilities

  futilities misery hunger-
we cant do anything about it
in this general disturbance the own-
ers are suffering worse than any-
one else every day another one
goes bankrupt the unemployed
arent the only ones who have their
trouble believe me

  mme morain was unconvinced
what will become of them ive
seen things like that before i have
seen children begging in the streets
and troops charging the workers
my father was not liked by his

workmen by instinct when i was
young i feared and hated them
since then i have come to under-
stand that its not a one-sided ques-
tion and i never think of the luxury
around me without a kind of vague
remorse

  you forget that the work the
activity of your husband gives a
means of subsistence to some thou-
sands of workers their lot in life
seems hard to you because you put
yourself in their places with your
refined tastes your habits and your
different instincts certain people
try to persuade them that they are
actively unhappy how in the world
did you come to be taken in by this
foolish humanitarianism sele-
vines talk

 you still think he was to
blame

  who selevine

  yes havent you been accusing
him

  his part in the whole business
is so obscure no one really knows
certainly he did not create the
siderosis i imagine the first germs
probably appeared spontaneously in
the course of the experiments with
which he has been busy for so long
surprised at first he wished to use
them for-	turn page

  absolutely not selevine is no
doubt capable of acts for which
ordinary morality would reproach
him if he thought they would ad-
vance his ideals but that he would
stab his friends in the back i will
never believe

  how much heat you work up in
his defence commented leclair
sarcastically oh i have noticed
how he looks at you the manners
of the savage dont displease you
after all do they come on ad-
mit it

  he was repentant at the sudden
irritation in her eyes and went on
rapidly

  i was joking pardon me just
the same it is curious that we cant
talk for a minute without the sub-
ject of seleviae coming up its
a regular obsession you a young
woman rjch in all the gifts of beau-
ty and mind sensitive to affection
made to love and be loved-how can
you find any pleasure in the society
of sociologists and scientists you
are wasting your youth here

  no im attached to this place
by memory and habit i like it for
these reasons and for some others
which you wouldnt understand
now monsieur leclair you must
have a very frivolous conception of
what women are like i dont doubt
but that you have known some
charming ones whose character
more nearly approached your
ideals

  leclair searched his mind for
some intelligent reply and was irri-
tated not to find any he hazarded
heavily perhaps its because im
certain you are unhappy

 the whistle of a nearby tug
drowned the end of the remark

  the night had almost come but in
the west a greenish light still per-
sisted above wavrechain pillars
of smoke caught a blot of reef light
that was being slowly swallowed up
in the environing shadows cinders
borne down the wind danced in the
road ahead

  lighter than thistledown a flake
lit on the shoulder of the young
woman her face appeared a white
oval in the gloom in which the only
distinct features were the marvels
of her eyes and her encarmined
lips and to leclair she seemed more
mysterious and desirable than ever
what did words matter in his
thought he caressed her unclothed
body he was still absorbed in such
erotic imaginings when she turned
at the doorstep and extended her
hand

  good night monsieur leclair i
pardon you your impertinence be
as kind to others in the future and
be a little more tolerant in your
judgments

morain had succeeded in in-
creasing the resistance of steel
to the malady though without con-
ferring upon it any real immunitj
by applying certain physical treat-
ments after a space of time the
usual effects would appear but the
new product was good enough to
meet tests specified in contracts and
to secure acceptance of delivery
with gamus he had launched a new
enterprise-duro-fer inc but the
profits fell considerably below the
expected figure

  the time was hardly favorable
for marketing metals and the wood
workers and manufacturers of
cardboard were the only people do-
ing really good business most of
the industrialists to avoid trouble
had become skeptical of the new
alloys of which hundreds were be-
ing marketed by unscrupulous
firms but the government depart-
ments attached as they were to
their little customs continued to
acquire armorplate and guns wthose
rapid decay was inevitable battle-
ships left port carrying with them
the invisible elements of their own
destruction even the pacifists were
horrified at this swift decay of
frances armament

 the foundry-master had been
the death of iron



forced to lay off the greater part of
his workmen in the department
devoted to the production of fine
steels and special alloys a certain
activity alone persisted chouleur
was there deploring the general
misfortune with the more sincerity
since it involved the end of his own
job winter with his goat-like head
was with him and lefevre lost in
calculations of the resistance of
metals and old martin the deaf and
stupid

  morain assisted by leclair
worked twelve hours a day in the
factory carrying on the battle step
by step haunted by a fixed idea
morain hardly slept but with eyes
wide open in the dark dreamed of
means of getting at the essential
essence of the malady and conquer-
ing it

  to help him in the laboratory he
had hired a little red-faced man
who ran down to the foundry every
ten minutes to look over the cru-
cibles and returned with a face like
a little red sun after bending over
the fiery material osmond with a
reputation for achievement in metal-
lurgical chemistry busied himself
with the researches that had been
selevines special forte

  morain could not but make com-
parisons not altogether to the ad-
vantage of the newcomer at bot-
tom he regretted that he had ever
thrown away what was after all
the best chance of saving his fac-
tory even if he were at the bottom
of the trouble the russian might
have repented repaired at least
a part of the damage he had done
and brought lucid intelligence to
the task that was crushing them all

  the steel man recognized the
skinny silhouette of his former as-
sistant on the horizon one night he
was tramping along as though bur-
dened with sorrows coatless in
spite of the cold weather a kind of
pity touched morains heart but the
other had vanished into the dis-
tance too rapidly to be recalled even

if the steel man could have made up
his mind to do it

  in everything he attempted the
same indecision was manifested he
who had always been prompt in
resolution firm of will found him-
self perplexed and hesitant before
resolving upon the slightest deci-
sion the difficulties with which he
was struggling were slowly devour-
ing him

  the aid he received from the
government authorities was insig-
nificant the cabinet frightened by
the amplitude of the crisis refused
to accord any further subsidies to
the industry investigations went
on so slowly in the factories where
men of science gathered to discuss
the origin of the siderosis in
learned terms from his interview
with the most celebrated of them
all landry the foundry-head car-
ried away only the impression of
having talked with a very nice old
gentleman

  the scientist had caressed his
beard listening to morains explan-
ation with a far-away air such
phenomena were an offense to his
reputation to the academy and the
sacred name of science which could
not find a place for them in its cata-
logues landry who had made his
reputation in electronics felt him-
self personally insulted by the mani-
festation of a form of energy which
escaped all classification not wish-
ing to compromise his reputation
by snap judgments he had given
the assurance that researches would
be carried on along the lines indi-
cated by m morain who from that
moment had heard nothing further
from him

  the papers however had begun
to talk about the blue evil and their
paid campaigns backed by compa-
nies of stock-manipulators began
to create some excitement

  upon its being brought to his at-
tention the prefect of the depart-
ment du nord emerged from the
torpor into which the prospect of in-
wonder story annual



tervening in so curious an affair
had plunged him after having
heard several reports run through
numerous files of papers he re-
flected for a while and then decided
to send a squadron of cavalry to
denain

  the horsemen arrived in the city
one morning the pale rays of the
early sun of march played on their
polished cuirasses arriving at the
city hall they dismounted while the
children regarded them admiring-
ly attached their horses to the trees
and went off to eat something and
drink a little wine

delirium

at the foundry one morning the
steam engine which furnished
the power for the lamps and electric
furnaces the only machine that still
operated with regularity presented
unmistakable signs of having
caught the disease

  the ear of a trained mechanic is
seldom deceived chouleur who
worked near the engine modified
the position of the regulating valve

  the machine went on with its
normal beat but a little later the
pace speeded up the light in the
rooms grew the danger lights lit
up and the rapid movement of the
indicating needles disturbed leclsir
who came to see what the trouble
was he saw chouleur fumbling
feverishly in a tool box and then
saw him attack a safety valve with
a wrench nevertheless electric cur-
rent under the mounting pressure
escaped leaping out in a brilliant
flaring of the giant carbons in the
herault furnace where the steel was
liquified through all the inter-
stices through the refractory joints
in the furnace flames leaped out
illuminating the room and lighting

up the face of the astonished electri-
cian

  the automatic circuit-breaker
went into action cutting off the cur-
rent lightened the steam-engine
seemed to bound speeding up its
rhythm to a still more furious pace
a sudden shock made the ground
tremble morain was overwhelmed
raymond undecided chouleur
worked at his useless task with the
jerky motions of a jumping-jack

  all at once there was a terrific ex-
plosion iron sang through the air a
violent whistling filled the place it
seemed to raymond that the roof
blew outward and then fell back amid
tearing flames struck by some mass
that came hurtling through the air
he lay flat on his back

  the factory filled with cries the
screams of men injured by flying
pieces of iron a superheated vapor
burned the eyes corroded the lungs
and a rain of hot cinders plunged
through the escaping steam with a
strident hissing sound

  when the men came to help him
leclair opened his eyes and found
himself on the ground with garments
empurpled the mass which had
struck him was the body of morain
which lay by his side the stomach
torn open it seemed to him that
his life was oozing out with the blood
from his torn veins inertly he was
lifted onto a stretcher 

  leclair opened his eyes again and
looked around a grey dawn was
filtering through the curtains light-
ing up a room he immediately recog-
nized why had he been brought to
ronceraies a remembrance of some
kind worried him his mind finally
disengaged itself from sleep and
found contact with the exterior
world the events of the day before
surged into his memory as a series
of fragmentary images a movement
aroused a pain in his shoulder it
was not a nightmare then the ex-
plosion of the boiler morain injured
his mouth twisted his fingers con-
torted with agony
the death of iron



  toward the middle of the morning
dr levysson came in with various
objects necessary for the dressing- of
wounds he took the temperature
of his patient and declared his prog-
ress satisfactory raymond had mul-
tiple contusions blit nothing of
gravity his left arm broken in two
places was confined in a sling

  well were going to have you fit
as a fiddle in two months the doctor
declared drawing the bandages
tight but youll have to do every-
thing mademoiselle claire says you
were extremely lucky my fine fellow
to get off so easily the stoker was
instantly killed and monsieur morain
was frightfully injured by the pieces
of iron which would have hit you if
he hadnt been standing right in
front of you at the moment of the
explosion rut well pull him through
yet unless there are internal lesions
what is your opinion as to the cause
of the accident

  siderosis must have gotten to the
boiler

  oh come a malady of iron i
was astonished to hear morain who
is usually so clear-headed listening
to such rot   well well these me-
tallurgists always looking for some-
thing new turn your arm a little
so i can pin this dressing in place
there done and he turned to the
nurse mademoiselle claire you
will take his temperature regularly
and dont let him agitate himself i
wont be back till tomorrow you are
not a very interesting case my dear
raymond

a s though to disprove this as-
sertion the young mans fever
began going up about noon the pain
of the broken arm extended upward
to his shoulder as soon as the doctor
left he had wished to speak to renee
and the sight of the young matron
wearing on her face the signs of her
trouble and fatigue had depressed
him profoundly she had seated her-
self beside him taking his hand in

her own icy fingers and bending over
him with the tender flowers of her
eyes dampened with tears

  for two days raymond was deliri-
ous seeing the face of the nurse and
the carefully barbered visage of the
doctor as though through a fog then
a noticeable improvement appeared
his temperature dropped and he was
able to eat a little dr levysson told
him that morain overwhelmed by
his injuries had died the previous
evening in spite of his care

  he left his affairs in a muddled
state the creditors who had been
patient enough up to this time now
came on the run leclair imagined
renee without protection in a world
of wolves a flood of energy filled
him he tried to get up and the pain
provoked by the effort drew a cry
from his lips the nurse who came
in at once said you really must be
quiet

  do you know where mme morain
is

  she has gone to douchy with her
aunt for the funeral

  raymond lay back among the pil-
lows he imagined the cortege pass-
ing through the streets lined with
workmen to the old cemetery renee
in mourning with tragic eyes in a
white face without the slightest
transition the visage of selevine
sarcastic and fine slid into the field
of his memory

  he thought of the steel company
brought down by the blue evil and
of the electrical plant at machou
menaced by an identical calamity
the result of a commercial transac-
tion in which he had been the prime
mover by reason of his having used
the good offices of his friends ten
thousand tons of rails and tubes
forged at the morain foundries had
gone to carry the plague into the
orient

  certainly several months before
the manifestations of the blue evil
had not been clear one could almost
have denied its existence that ought


wonder story annual

to reassure even the most meticulous
conscience for having yielded to the
desire to make a fat commission

   but in the solitude of his room the
excitement of his injuries filled him
with a series of exaggerated scruples
this state of mind seemed so abnor-
mal to him that he felt his own pulse
and discovered that he once more
had a fever

there was a mass-meeting at
lourches and the assemblv room
of the old school was jammed to the
bursting point with the unemployed

  it was early in the evening and a
lierht fo covered the city now and
then voices and cries were audible
the clamor would reach a maximum
often punctuated by a shot a hand
of workmen went by brandishing
coupling bars and singing a revolu-
tionary song

   a month before the principal fac-
tories of the region had been forced
to halt all work and to lay off their
personnel and the troubles were in-
creasing

  ths tron syndicate subsidized by
the employers committee organ-
ised bread-lines but the staffs broke
down under the work there were
disputes which quickly became mini-
ature riots the jobless went to
demonstrate in the city accusing
their former employers of wishing
to starve them they poured around
the factories breaking everything
they could lay their hands on out of
a sheer spirit of mischief the effer-
vescence reached conde peruwelz
and mons streetcars were halted
in the streets and trucks pushed
over on their sides nevertheless the
miners remained calm for the most
part but the workers in the glass
cloth and type-metal industries after
agitated meetings voted to strike

  the situation became complicated
the heads of the industries showed
the most conciliatory spirit in gen-
eral but some of them brought to
the verge of ruin by the failure of

production tried to provoke a gen-
eral lockout

  the demand for iron fell and fell
its value dropped off by a third but
on the other hand certain alloys ad-
vanced in price those who had
stocks of sound steel showed them-
selves in no hurry to end a situation
which was enriching them

  unscrupulous dealers threw on the
market at low prices tainted goods
whose character had been cleverly
camouflaged in the financial mar-
kets of the world came the first skir-
mishes that were the prelude to the
inevitable conflicts the crisis had
come on so rapidly that various in-
terests mixed and clashed in the
most confused fashion

  the labor federation addressed
an appeal to the working classes
setting forth the danger of any pre-
cipitate action and counseling pa-
tience the heads of the federation
tried to work out a solution that
would conciliate all antagonisms with
the aid of the ministry of labor but
without reaching any decisive result
all the delays involved only irritated
the workmen and while many de-
prived of all means of earning their
bread spent their time in  threats
and lamentations others voluntarily
walked out of the factories

  the iron-workers had chosen com-
rade laval as their delegate when
he had a few drinks he could talk
quite well the circumstances under
which he had been dismissed from
morains brought him much consid-
eration in labor circles after repeat-
ing it a hundred times he had come
to believe he was a victim of the
feudal capitalism personified by mo-
rain that man of prey that veritable
vampire who was fattening on the
blood of the people

  from the floor of the great hall
the air vitiated by human exhala-
tions blue with pipe-smoke and the
fumes of oil lamps the gesticulating
figure was barely visible his au-
ditors tried to make out his words
the death of iron



  we cant hear you cried some-
one

  he raised his voice

   the iron sickness will destroy the
bases on which this iniquitous so-
ciety rests and will aid our libera-
tion comrades a single movement
on your part and the whole rotten
structure will come down the occa-
sion is unparalleled dont let it go
by dont give our enemies time to
organize declare a general strike
now

  he halted he had recognized a
well-known figure in the hall

  i announce to you the presence
of two spies from the manufacturers
committee he cried and his finger
pointed toward leclair and barrois
the former smiling the latter a little
pale at this singling out there were
exclamations and a long whistle but
the president of the meeting inter-
vened

  we announced an open meeting
and these gentlemen are perfectly
free to come here and speak if they
like by respecting their presence
we will demonstrate to those who
sent them how workmen conscious
of their rights and dignities behave
themselves

into the mine

there was applause a remark
from laval woke the crowds
sense of humor low jokes rained
around these sons of the upper class-
es in their stiff collars but there
was a diversion from without and a
general rush toward the door as the
lugubrious sound of the fire-engine
was heard

  anotherone exclaimed barrois
that makes eight in a week well
thats more than a little over the
average inexplicable at least-

he looked about him-at least if
chance has not been aided slightly
but look its fhe gas-works and
urged on by that curiosity which
always draws human beings toward
accidents he hastened his steps pull-
ing leclair along after him

  there was assuredly touch activity
in the street men dashed to and fro
carrying lanterns

  a light broke out somewhere the
three big gas tanks loomed up huge
and squat from one of them a long
tongue of flame escaped to run
across the top joining with another
one and illumining all the surround-
ings

  buildings shot out clearly from
the shadows and seemed to recoil be-
fore the invading light the factory
the slag-piles the casting channels
stood out precisely

  through invisible cracks the
flames drew forces that increased
their strength they mounted rapid-
ly  streaked with yellow and purple
turning in huge spirals floating here
and there like the movement of dra-
peries the roofs of the tanks curled
and spotted the steel-work reddened
and then melted

  the affair took on a certain wild
grandeur a twisting column of
flame thirty feet tall a mushroom
of smoke with bloody reflections
lifted above the burning reservoir
like a gigantic torch

  the firemen after a brief and fruit-
less effort had given up hope of
mastering it a black cloud filled
with golden streaks covered the
place and its soft ramifications fil-
tering upward into space fell back
slowly like a snowstorm sometimes
as though torn by internal forces
this cloud heaved up in the center
and the invisible crater vomited new
columns of fire

  the people of the neighborhood
were warned to get their goods out
of their houses

  are we going back asked le-
clair impatiently


wonder story annual

  barrois had taken him by the arm

  as a matter of fact he said no
one has realized the gravity of the
situation yet in the department du
nord there are already a hundred
thousand unemployed why are they
delaying their transport to regions
where conditions are not so bad

  leclair did not care to know he
listed idly to his companion finding
his remarks full of good sense but
more than a little boresome nothing
could really endanger his faith in his
own future the only thing in which
he any longer had any faith he was
still lost in the happy astonishment
of his victory which he had never
believed would come so promptly

  in the affliction of her recent be-
reavement mme morain had wished
to delay his advances recoiling from
what other people would think even
leclair himself had wished to tem-
porize but circumstances had de-
cided otherwise the animal in-
stincts control us in curious ways
and they had yielded to them at the
very moment when they were ren-
dering a proper respect to the dead

  leclair had undertaken the more
delicate business affairs of his late
employer and in his preoccupation
had so to speak not had time to
organize his emotions his new posi-
tion opened many possibilities for
him possibilities which by a kind of
modesty he did not wish to envisage
in all their completeness but possi-
bilities which reinforced his feeling
of optimism

  he smiled remembering the slight-
ly frightened air of his companion
surrounded by the dull workmen and
their children then a sudden
thought made him pull out his watch
it was late-and barrois discourse
showed no signs of reaching its end

  day before yesterday he was
saying renaud delivered a lecture
on the iron sickness and asked that
a national subscription be opened to
check its advance would you believe
it-there were only about twenty

present the lack of curiosity of the
parisian public about everything
that does not directly concern its
interests or its pleasures is really
something stupefying if they were
only merely indifferent but the so-
cialists are openly rejoicing at the
spread of the siderosis which is hit-
ting the capitalists first

leclair repressed a yawn he
hesitated a moment searching
for some pretext for flight then de-
ciding remarked about the pain in
his arm still not completely knit

  as a precaution he turned toward
his own street first then making a
circuit headed for ronceraies

  morains housekeeper miss buick
an old maiden lady afflicted with
genuine english acne received him
with the utmost cordiality she was
occupied in sewing on some garment
while renee was reading in the gold-
en circle of light cast by a table-
lamp

  he waited a moment at the door
hardly daring to break in on the
silence and finding the charm of this
intimacy doubly pleasing after the
turbulence of the streets at the
slight odor of iris in the room the
beating of his heart increased

  the young woman who had been
waiting for him reproached him
with leaving her alone in the solitary
house in spite of her smile a trace
of genuine fear lurked in her eyes

  he tried to draw her to him

 dear renee every hour away
from you is like a penance

  she halted his gesture and placed
a finger on his lips

  they passed into the salon can-
dles were burning down in an antique
candelabrum lighting up polished
bronze and marble

  as mme morain received a good
many callers during the course of
the day they had agreed to keep up
appearances by having him call on
her only late in the evening it fol-
lowed that raymond would tell her
the death of iron



how he had spent his day

  i was with barrois when i felt
the need of coming to see you it
was altogether irresistable i left
him quickly without even shaking
hands with him the poor man must
think im a little cracked since my
accident i took him to the mass-
meeting where we were recognized
he was really quite frightened

  he laughed over the memory his
little fine teeth shone under his well-
designed lips mme morain admired
his youth his gaiety she drew him
closer to her

  what have you decided to do
oh well have to leave as soon
as i have realized on the stocks at
aulnoy

  oh lets lets get away from
the nord leave this unhappy city i
would so like to forget i need calm
and repose

  there were many things to disturb
her there creditors lawyers trying
to get this or that from her pursued
her ceaselessly she complained of
the attention of camus that chubby
personality was paying his court to
her and at the same time demanding
payment on unfulfilled contracts
couldnt she somehow make him
understand that his presence an-
noyed her

  leclairs face took on a little
frown

  no its impossible now since
she had left her interests in his
hands she must let him make the
arrangements camus was a pig but
an influential pig whom it was neces-
sary to avoid antagonizing

  she sighed he turned to her once
more his lips caressed her bare
arms her lips the young woman
pushed him away after a moment
and he thought she was annoyed but
saw her cross to the door and turn
the key  

the reason why a new outbreak
of accidents from the rotting
steels occurred at this time was gen-

erally unknown or misunderstood
many scientific minds refused to ad-
mit the possibility of a mineral
malady and hunted for explanations
in the arsenal of classical formulas
and molecular physics

  others completely denied what
they could not understand an amer-
ican scientist affirmed that they were
in the presence of a case of collective
suggestion this hypothesis found
resolute partisans in france

  nevertheless the bureau of tests
issuing from its prudent reserve
sent the first commission of research
into the devastated regions renaud
published the results of his re-
searchers on siderosis in the mines
the general public began to be in-
terested in the question a popular
song he cant see nothing but
blue was launched in paris and en-
joyed a wild success

  renaud a physician who studied
astronomy as a side line curious
about everything had followed the
work of morain with some interest
renaud was well known in society
and wrote a good deal for popular
papers his articles described such
subjects as the immensity of sidereal
space and the einstein theory of
time in a form not too difficult for
untechnical minds to follow and tied
up these cpncepts to ideas of the
most ordinary or rather the most
parisian character the bankers of
the city as they rode through the
subways in the morning absorbed
diverse facts faintly perfumed with
philosophy and the combination
gave them a flattering sense of their
own importance it is not bad from
time to time to cast a glance at the
end of existence and mans littleness
in the infinite universe after all
man is a thinking animal they
taught us as much in college

  a great daily paper hired renaud
to study the action of the sick metals
on the human body and he left to
explore the iron mines at fontoy
where the siderosis had struck with


wonder story annual

especial vigor

  these deposits situated to the
west of thionville are formed pri-
marily of a hydrated hematite with
phosphate intermixtures

  mining operations had once taken
place on the surface but were now
subterranean and for several years
the hills of andin had been tunneled
by superimposed systems of galle-
ries as a result of the breakdown of
the pumping systems most of the
mines had been inundated but even
before they had become utterly un-
workable the miners had fled from
the radiations of the minerals

the skins of those who had re-
mained at work became covered
with little sores which burst and
peelecf like small blistering burns
surface ulcers formed and scarred
over and the skin was colored a
bluish purple by the action of the
radioactive minerals

 care must be used renaud
wrote im going down into the
mines because of the destruction of
the ladders the infiltrations of water
and the possibility of falling roofs
it was not without difficulty that i
persuaded two miners to accompany
me the cages were not in operation
of course and it was by a series of
narrow emergency passages that we
penetrated to the heart of the mine
six hundred feet below the surface

  everywhere the traces of hasty
abandonment were visible the
ground was piled with debris with
little trucks on their broken rails
mining machines picks and broken
shovels were mixed with clay and
minerals fallen from the sides and
ceilings

  we arrived before an under-
ground lake surrounded by sulphur-
ous ores in the depths of the mother
waters the patient forces of nature
had given birth to delicate crystal-
line designs strange floral the pet-
rified lines had a harmonious equil-
ibrium the light of the torches

showed the place in all its strange-
ness and picked out the rhythmically
dripping drops of water here and
there shining rhomboids stood out
stalactites amid the purple rocks
with a splendor at once massive and
barbarous

  the further we descended into
this place ravaged by fire and water
the greater the brilliance grew our
shoes crushed piles of snowflake-like
designs and the pressure of a hand
against a wall was sufficient to bring
out a series of ephemeral lights
they slept a leaden sleep beneath the
water-pools but a stone tossed into
the pool would wake them all and
pale irised reflections cold flares
would run across the surface

  in a breath of vapor the torches
flared and smoked when they were
extinguished an unexpected light
was visible a light secreted by the
atmosphere itself it is difficult to
give an exact idea of its character
it was made up of an obscurity and
a light in some odd way interacting
a night like those of the polar re-
gions when all the auroras are awake
calm and sinister with an illumina-
tion that seems to come from behind
the earth

  ill at ease disconcerted with my
own feebleness  breathed with diffi-
culty the humid air poisoned by the
same pestilence the reason for the
feeling became apparent as we
stumbled on the carcass of a horse
which barred the course of a rivulet
its frightful thinness indicated that
it had been abandoned living in the
mine a multitude of dead rats their
white bellies in the air strewed the
ground around it

  as i examined the little corpses
the sound of a shattered crystal sud-
denly attracted our attention my
stupefaction can be imagined on dis-
covering in a kind of niche a man
occupied at a task altogether incom-
prehensible a tripod loaded with
various instruments stood by his
side he looked up with surprise at
the death of iron



hearing us and without giving me
time to speak said with a strong
english accent

   look out there are wires along
there turn there and walk careful-
ly watch out he held a photo-
graphic plate before the light

   i am austin he said of the
roval institute

  and when i presented myself he
added

  i am just finishing my work
important work this malady of iron
interests vou too

    certainly

   and you dont know the worst
of it yet i say this there is going
to be a prodigious upset not in our
century but during our lives you
will see if i told you-by the way
i am very glad to have met you dr
renaud

  he had taken me familiarly by
the arm and began to tell me about
his theories i perceived that his left
arm was bandaged hung limp at his
side and that there was a bleeding
wound below his collar

   where does that come from 

i	asked

   radiations from the mineral
there is a definite projection of finely
divided matter and an emission of
waves the latter are the more dan-
gerous look-the walls are luke-
warm the iron is decaying rapidly
and its internal energy is escaping on
every side

  he remained thoughtful for a
moment his eyes half-closed behind
their huge-glasses and his finger
pointed to an evidently gangrening
mass

   those aggregates of matter are
returning to nothingness men work-
ing with iron for thousands of years
has permitted unknown forces to
develop in the metal itself this is
the fruit of his labor and what a
monstrous product it is what do
you say austin there is no blue
evil only a mutation of the ferro-
carbonic species

decay

oix months after the death of
morain there remained of his
foundries only the wreckage of two
hulls the rest had become a mound
of fallen girders and stones long
ossicles of iron projected from the
tanged mass of bricks and concrete
thp dissolving skeleton of the mon-
strous corpse on which the elements
were now finishing their work of
destruction

  a vague curiosity drew selevine to
the field where matter was suffering
and dying he tried one day to work
his way into the bay where the con-
tagion had become manifest for the
first time there beneath the stag-
gering roof he was struck dumb by
the tormented forms which still held
a little of the aspect of the machines
they had once been now they had
become greying blocks starred with
phosphorescent spots swelling with
pustules and knots-the final form
of the disease

  the plates were bending and curl-
ing like autumn leaves bars were
tortured into spirals inextricable
twistings suggested the appearance
of living plants of groups of algae or
black roots twisted out of the earth
by some force of their own the slag
heaps were covced with the wind-
ings of horrible ring-worms and ul-
cers had broken out on all the piles
of unused ore under the force of the
hternal decay

  there were certain places like
spvngy ashes where some unknown
form of lichen detached itself and
fell at the visitors tread one trod
into the ground dry dead things
that cracked like old twigs squashed
lukewarm fermentations into the
earth as one walked further on the
rain had leached out the remains into

a thick soup-like pool up through
which nettles and other quick-grow-
ing plants were pushing to cover the
ruins with a verdant tapestry

  iron is returning to the ma-
ternal earth thought selevine
but is it still iron 

  the circumstances through which
these phenomena had shown them-
selves returned to the engineers
memory a reminiscence an image
situated on the borders of memory
became clearer suddenly he re-
called the appearance of the me-
teorite fontaine had given him a
year before a fragment of lava scin-
tillating with strange blue lights it
had the same appearance as the sick
steels in the last stages of their de-
composition

  the truth he had felt for a long
time became clear in his mind-the
origin of the siderosis was extra-
terrestrial

  an emotion invaded him the
revelation struck him with an al-
most physical impact crucibles of
fire the shock of stars tornadoes in
the taciturn depths of space    and
look at the result of these titanic
efforts-a calcined stone contain-
ing like a funeral urn the germs
of death

  he thought of the feebleness of
man once the master of all forces
and king of the earth-thanks to
the machines he had conceived and
the frightful problem of what would
happen if all matter the substance
upon which the precious forces of
life depend for existence should
suddenly give way presented itself
to his mind like a body without a
skeleton human civilization would
collapse	

  already all the neighboring re-
gions had a foretaste of the impend-
ing destruction

  in belgium and lorraine the tall
furnaces were rusting the forges
of ongres the factories of ravange
joeuf and moyeuvre were com-
pletely destroyed the damage had
reached the luxembourg mines and

the rhineland deposits where the
importation of french irons had
been forbidden too late the metal
marts of the saar the ports of the
ruhr all slept and the flotillas of
steamers which carried the iron
and oil to belgium and holland lay
moored at their wharves side by
side at ruhrort the warships slow-
ly dissolved in their basins the
heavy waters carried a foam of rust
down to boil against the bridge-
piers

toward the month of septem-
ber all machine traffic with the
north and east of france became
irregular combustibles were not to
be had at any price and all public
lighting was discontinued in rou-
baix and valenciennes only in the
railroad stations did a few agon-
ized flares durn to show the sad dis-
order of everything around them
accumulated goods of every kind
materials falling to pieces cars im-
mobile and rotting touched in
their most vital parts all their most
delicate mechanism broken the rail-
road services were at the end of
their resources misery brooded
over france

  the collapse of the markets the
growing and general unemploy-
ment the distress of the laboring
classes without means and without
bread placed before the government
agonizing problems which it sought
in vain to solve as events pro-
gressed deputy lebon came out of
the shadows where his ambition had
cast him and by a series of intelli-
gent suggestions captured popular
favor

  his promises to do something
about it began to be borne out when
his brother-in-law manager of the
chiers factory received from the
government an order for five mil-
lion francs worth of arms and
armor plate nevertheless the
chiers establishment hard hit by
the general depression of novem-
the death of iron



ber went down in the failure of the
general metals combine precipitat-
ing a financial scandal in which the
new minister betrayed by his
colleagues saw the finish of a po-
litical career which might have be-
come extremely useful

  under the pressure of public
opinion the chamber voted new
laws against speculation

  they failed to touch the magnates
who were engaged in the combat
for the coal and iron industries
there were several suicides on all
sides french values fell off on the
foreign exchanges the money
market became the scene of fren-
zied speculation banks began to
take measures to protect themselves
against the possibility of riots

  the amplitude of these troubles
upset foreign exchanges at first
commanding high prices in world
markets american and german
steels began to feel the influence of
the general depression tariffs
boosted to the skies killed off all
hope of profitable operations a uni-
versal distrust caused buying to fall
off all industries were menaced

  it was at this time that the steel
magnates of the rhine laid the foun-
dations of an international under-
standing it was necessary for all
steel men to ally themselves against
the common enemy after some
hesitation pittsburgh and london
joined the cartel important firms
rallied around it the steel trust
the great railroads set optimistic
rumors afloat and their agents by a
series of careful maneuvers suc-
ceeded in halting the fall in values

  a consortium of bankers took
things in hand at denain and forced
some of the damaged factories to a
new vitality the workers of the re-
gion and specialists from every
country in the world were called in
technicians with an enthusiasm
aroused by the promise of huge re-
wards attacked the problem of the
contagion directly

  there was after a period of dis-

order a fever of work

 iron work was replaced by
wooden beaming machines and
cables received hourly inspections
with the assistance of newly in-
vented apparatus concrete props
sustained the weakening roofs
steel was purified in the tall fur-
naces of longwy and then sent to
the forges of st dizier and creu-
sot

 hammers beat the burning
masses rolling mills flattened them
with fervor cold water seized on
them with a strident hissing they
circulated through the forge-shops
turning to heavy ingots with depths
of purple light

  cooled beneath their igneous
crusts the virgin iron and fresh
copper were encased in sheets of
lead loaded barges and tugs
plowed the meuse and escaut in
long lines

in the railroad centers the move-
ment of life commenced again
the broken communications were
made good the cables were re-
stored the infected parts carried
away and the cars which had rusted
to their rails resting like regi-
ments of ants around a sugar-heap
moved with a plaintive rhythm the
locomotives whistled once more as
inspectors pounded their sounding
wrheels orders and shouts mingled
with the clang of bells behind win-
dows the struggle was carried on
above and below the earth

  the steel vibrated to the shocks
of the wheels the plates resounded
with the deafening uproar no one
dared to think of the consequences
of an accident of an enfeebled rail
or a wheel suddenly blocked anx-
iety was in every heart so much
the worse then man carried along
by the tumult he had created was
unable either to stop or go back

  the task was facilitated by the
establishment of emergency elec-
trical lines from the generating
plants at lille torrents of energy
	wonder story annual

flowed down the cables a thousand
bulbs lit up in the factories and
yards with cries of joy the inhabit-
ants saw the familiar stars of their
nights reborn

   electricity was nevertheless dis-
tributed thriftily in spite of all
precautions the generating mechan-
isms that had once been touched
by the siderosis did not work well
even after repairing after several
ineffectual efforts the engineers
gave up trying to use the electrical
machinery of the region every
night the shadows encroached a few
more steps

  only the saloons punctuated the
night with attractive lights leav-
ing their factories the workmen
found in these airless rooms ren-
dered stuffy by the smoke of bad
tobacco the cherished habits the
familiar vices without which life is
no more than a monotonous tor-
ment the sharp beer foamed into
their glasses to be left standing
they drank gin they played cards
they watched cockfights on tables
cleared off for the purpose and bet
a weeks wages on the result placid
jocular belgians were prominent
among them foremen dressed to
the minute swallowed costly cock-
tails synthetic blondes sold their
well-born bodies the raucous or
sonorous syllables of a dozen dif-
ferent dialects mingled

the coming of revolt

a whole heterogeneous popula-
tion attracted by the hope of
high wages and in a vague way by
enormous illegitimate profits had
invaded valenciennes where the
reconstruction committee had its
headquarters brought in by the
committee which was looking for
cheap labor anywhere without in

the least worrying about the effect
of these importations on the labor
of their own country

  the unemployed and the strikers
avoided mixing with this floating
labor and assembled at raismes

  super-excited with alcohpl their
cries and songs in the streets would
wake the shop-keepers who trem-
bled behind their barricaded win-
dows the pillage of the factories
had become a veritable industry
the more advanced papers even en-
couraged such robberies it is a
right for the famished people they
proclaimed a reprisal against the
profiteers

  one morning at one of the shops
two watchmen were found dead
their throats slit the chief of po-
lice increased the number of gen-
darmes army reservists made noc-
turnal rounds but as there were so
few of them they could stop neither
the pillaging in which half the
population was engaged nor the
work of destruction the unemployed
were doing

  the gendarmes were clumsy and
often brutal when they went by on
horseback through the narrow
streets squeezing the pedestrians
against the walls the women cer-
tain of their immunity hurled in-
sults at them stones flew through
the air a horse hit would rear
the man who did it was always lost
in the crowd

  these incidents multiplied in
all the coal pits the workers were
agitated those who had approached
too near the sick irons bore on
face or arms the scaly traces and
empurpled ulcers of the radio-
dermic action these superficial
traces were sufficiently painful to
spoil the sleep and sap the energy
of the sufferers and on them dis-
order seemed to produce an intoxi-
cation like that of alcohol

  the railroad uniting valencien-
nes to tournai was cut for a hun-
dred kilometers the trains could not
move

i
the death of iron	

 several businessmen without
scruples began to speculate in food
this was the basic reason behind
the bloody days of january

  men struggled desperately with
the blue evil and their creative en-
ergies seemed to strike an equili-
brium with the forces of destruc-
tion for a moment then the plague
began to gain once more there was
a period of dread the calm which
precedes the tempest then came
a time in which the malady of iron
was almost forgotten in the social
conflicts which it indirectly pro-
voked

  paris remained calm there were
several murders of course and a
few stupendous robberies but these
ordinary events were not the gen-
eral rule the fall of the eiffel tow-
er which had been constructed in
an age of great metallurgical ad-
vance the collapse of the subways
provoked nothing but a little mild
conversation human sensitiveness
became hardened to stories of
violent death

  the meetings of the international
iron cartel had drawn a crowd of
foreigners to the capital the de-
valuation of money gave a tempo-
rary stimulus to business stores
theatres and night clubs joined in a
remarkable and unexpected pros-
perity if the country were becom-
ing poorer the merchants speculat-
ing in exchange and food products
benefited by the difference between
the actual prices of articles and the
salaries paid in paper and rapidly
amassed fortunes

the people accused them of being
insatiable but how else could
they accumulate the capital which
would enable them to speed up pro-
duction and thus aid the masses  at
least this was the question which
most economists put to despoil
them was to bring ruin on the thou-
sands to whom they gave employ-
ment money obeys strict laws it
circulates like the blood in the veins

carrying with it life and well-being
before returning to the source from
which it has issued if the move-
ment ceases for a single day society
will perish in agony

  three enormous balls and a bene-
fit performance at the opera were
organized for the benefit of those
without work but from this splen-
did charitable effort hardly the
slightest wave reached the suburbs
where the hungry were besieging
the bakeries children roamed
about at night disinterring half-
grown beets and potatoes in the
fields

  six more corporations were put
out of business by strikes the
heads of the textile industry unable
to get coal closed their factories
the coal remained in the ground
and ships without fuel floated like
coffins in the black waters of the
canals the trees in the parks
gradually disappeared no light
reddened factory or forge but occa-
sionally a pillar of smoke would rise
against the horizon of fog as some
store of wheat was fired in reprisal
against its owner

  extremists found in these events
an admirable occasion for their
propaganda one of the heads of the
left-wing parties citizen pinchon
secretary of the metal workers
union ran throughout france or-
ganizing methodical disorder he
tried to bring the woikers out of
their apathy by telling them of
needs they had not considered be-
fore

  he had begun life as a factory
boy but had gone to night school
and turned out badly he wrote
pamphlets in which a just resent-
ment over the wrongs he himself
had suffered mingled with a vicious-
ness of spirit which even his best
friends found insupportable these
writings rich in poisons were dis-
tributed in profusion among the
working classes

  after one of his propaganda tours
pinchon let loose the following
	wonder story annual

  cynical statement

  the people have lost the taste
for good figures of speech and can
only be aroused by out-of-date
ideas their imaginations inspired
by moronic movies do not go be-
yond their individual potentialities
and are degraded by the lowest of
appetites we can do nothing
against this universal indifference
and stupidity

  the directors of the great trusts
were not impressed and would
have desired at least one violent
conflict that would definitely break
the revolutionary forces they
feared those sly hostilities and par-
tial strikes which exhausted an in-
dustry like a fever in order to
please them the government adopted
severely repressive measures in
expectation of a general strike large
stores of cereals were gathered and
black troops called in from africa
as being the most useful in police
work and immune to propaganda

  these children of the sun torn
from their primitive barbarism
had received excellent elementary
educations beside the sound the-
ories with regard to respect for
force and wealth with which they
had been inculcated they had been
brought up in a notion of warlike
honor

  their shoes seemed to know by
instinct just where it is necessary
to kick a man in order to produce
in him a beneficial contrition for his
misdeeds if in the exercise of such
functions they were called upon
quite frequently to provoke the
poorer classes and particularly the
unemployed it was not by accident
but by enlightened choice the result
of deduction and reflection-truly
noble processes of thought

the jobless had become a verit-
able social plague they accepted
their ignominious misery one
would have said with something
like pleasure troubling the rich in
the enjoyment of their profits with-

out any gain on either side and dis-
turbing the thoughts of ideal jus-
tice however they could be an-
noyed in a number of wrays with
considerable ease they were un-
able to defend themselves this was
as a mathematican would say suffi-
cient reason in fact this defence-
lessness is one of the strongest
props of moral principle a support
which could not be removed with-
out bringing down the whole of so-
ciety

  the black brigades were very
popular among the people who had
work artisans salesmen and so on
who on sundays went to the drill-
grounds at the edge of the city
where they watched the blacks as
with nude torsos they went through
the exercises of sabre use and bomb-
throwing curious about things
military-animated by patriotic
fervor and sometimes by inex-
pressible desires - the women
pressed around the fences that sur-
rounded the drill-fields

  there also the little disciplined
troops of the national militia came
for their exercises having replaced
their civil clothes by a uniform coat
a shirt of white silk and a velvet
beret their numbers grew with
rapidity lively amazons accompa-
nied them when they passed
through the streets proud and erect
under their embroidered flags a
murmur of admiration was alw-ays
heard

  while the militia were received
everywhere as liberators the job-
less encountered universal re-
proach they had acquired the de-
plorable habit of holding their gath-
erings in open air of assembling in
hostile groups in front of the the-
atres and fashionable restaurants
where they annoyed the eaters en-
gaged in the peaceful labor of di- 
gestion

  one morning they gathered in a
crowd of twenty thousand strong
and marched through the boule-
vards in good order men mutilated
the death of iron	

in the factories at their head the
police turned them aside without
undue violence and they poured
through the exterior avenues to the
city limits

  a man of uncertain age his face
bearded and lined his clothes shab-
by his air sad and depressed
mounted on a little hill and held a
paper close to his glasses it was
grammont the only man who from
the beginning had undertaken a
sincere defense of the laborers he
lived in the hope of some day seeing
the reign of justice and peace es-
tablished and he preached the love
of ones neighbor the despisal of
riches and-vegetarianism

  events had drawn him from his
retreat and vague general ideas
to take a part in the solution of im-
mediate social problems he had
been a professor in an academy for
young girls and to this fact he owed
it that he had not been accused of
anything extraordinary in the line
of vices but only of the seduction of
minors with his position lost
abandoned by his friends avoided
by his former colleagues he ex-
piated the detestable insolence of
having freely expressed his opin-
ions

  on the grass strewn with oyster-
shells and melon-rinds the proletar-
ians considered with a combination
of mockery and disgust this man of
whiskers and papers this bourgeois
who had come over to their side for
some unknown reason his feeble
voice hardly reached their ears they
were bored it svas with pleasure that
they saw deputy lebon take his
place

  the deputy was clothed with a
studied vulgarity that marked him
as a true son of the people who would
never deny his origin his speech
at once violent and pathetic against
the government swept all doubt
about his integrity away and at once
restored him to the confidence of the
extremist parties he described the

misery of the working classes and
ended thus

  the government has refused to
provide government department
stores it has suppressed cash pay-
ments to the unemployed in order to
build more battleships which it finds
more useful than houses and to
strengthen the army the last ram-
part against the social revolution
manifesting a misplaced pride it has
discouraged international goodwill
toward france

  it is more than enough i solemn-
ly notify those in power that the
patience of the people has reached
its limit you who live in the shadow
of egotistical indifference you rich
men who have grown richer through
these troubles you profiteers of the
public ruin do not wait until it is too
late to make the necessary sacri-
fices fear the awakening of the
people fear their anger august and
terrible

  frantic applause saluted this pero-
ration lebon had to be rescued
from the enthusiasm of his admirers
who would have borne him through
the streets on their shoulders

  this speech was not without influ-
ence on his political future at this
period the deputy was passing
through a kind of spiritual crisis
convicted of shady transactions not
very important in themselves but
nevertheless inexcusable abandoned
by his friends in the chamber he
discovered once more that softness
of heart toward the common people
which had carried him into power

  besides the elections were ap-
proaching with an unfailing politi-
cal sense he discerned the approach
of a change an orientation toward a
system of concessions to the laboring
classes sacrificing everything else to
the reestablishment of its fortunes

  in the chamber lebon demanded
the immediate institution of projects
which would absorb idle labor and a
policy of financial economies togeth-
er with a capital levy after a neu-

ministry was overthrown on a point
of order

iously constructed out of the remains
of various ministerial shipwrecks

socialists

chaos

at anzin conde and mons un-
employment was not general
ten thousand descents into the mine
were made daily in spite of the fall-
ing roofs the infiltrations of water
the breakage of iron ladders and
trucks men continued to bring out
the coal by the most primitive means
and at the price of back-breaking
efforts at the roll call men were
missing from every gang the earth
dumbly swallowed these twenty-
francs-a-day heroes engineers kept
the last machines going around
them pumps struggled with the in-
vading tides motors soiled with oil
and earth worked on

  the strikers encircled those vital
points

  at the close of a meeting held at
raismes a thousand of them pillaged
a trainload of food and burned what
was left they headed for the amau-
ry and latour pits when they en-
countered a patrol of cavalry the
greater number of the strikers fled
but a handful made a resistance
against the authorities around
them the others gathered again and
tried to liberate the prisoners horses
wounded by knife-thrusts threw
their riders and galloped wildly
away

  that evening there was a tumul-
tuous assembly at conde the police
forces surrounded the maison du
peuple the gendarmes penetrated

into the hall with the vociferating
crowd there was a panic and people
were crushed at the doors the gen-
darmes backed out gradually and
their prudence being mistaken for
fear the movement went on three
thousand strikers marched on bruay
their line of march was cut off at
several points by barricades and
they were finally dispersed on the
height of escautpont

  leclair returning from denain
ran into a procession that grew at
every street corner it passed re-
pulsed by the rd brigade the mass
flowed back into the suburbs adoles-
cents brandished placards and an
acrid dust rose from the beating of
their feet drawn into the tumul-
tuous crowd deafened by the racket
he escaped into a little alley leading
off to one side

  leclair observed for an instant a
group of young men who were de-
molishing a trolley and felt a wave
of indignation at the sight of so
much stupidity and savagery he
was oppressed by the need of doing
something he turned round sud-
denly disturbed by the thought that
renee might have gone out but at
six-mariannes a company of blue
guards refused to let him through

  once more he heard the beat of
feet on the ground at the end of
the street a company of infantry
armed with rifles was passing most
of them disappeared behind the cus-
toms building but the rest halted

dismounting from his horse an
officer consulted a card bearing
his orders and lifting his head per-
ceived leclair he asked the shortest
road to prouvy very young with
rosy cheeks beneath his gold-laced
military cap the military man was
affecting an assured mien but his
gestures betrayed his nervousness
they had ordered him to watch the
bridge at haulchain and prevent the
strikers of trith and douchy from
uniting but of the bridge there re-
the death of iron



mained nothing but three arches of
stone twisting his moustache he
confided

  there are six thousand strikers
at samain with all sorts of criminals
and some belgian scum they have
destroyed the concession denfer
and the offices of the reconstruction
commission

  but what in the world do they
want  cried the engineer

  its a mess replied the officer
theres disorder and anarchy every-
where and even fighting douchy is
full of trouble the belgians went
down into the pits but the strikers
cut the tubing and all the galleries
were drowned out at bruay they
smoked the miners to death in their
holes like rats

  suddenly he stopped his eyes fixed
on a point of the horizon from the
height they could see over part of
the city the multitudes of houses
the streets the roofs reaching away
to the horizon where the mist min-
gled with the golden smoke of a far-
away fire at the bottom of the
valley the escaut rolled its flood
along the granite quays

  looking toward denain leclair
saw the streets jammed with an ant-
like multitude from which mounted
a feeble rumor of sound audible
even at this distance a troop of
horsemen had just debouched from
the avenue des saint-peres and was
trying to hold back the crowd

  under the light of the sun the
little troop of cuirassiers seemed to
float in the midst of the crowd like
a fragment of silvery foam amid the
waves of a torrent it was disso-
ciated engulfed every visible trace
of its passage disappeared while the
great flood of human beings undu-
lated through the too-narrow streets

  at the moment while these events
were taking place there were other
skirmishes at douai mons and tour-
nai between the armed forces and
the jobless in revolt martial law was
proclaimed in all the basin of the

north and the administrative powers
were turned over to the military
authorities three squadrons of
cavalry some infantry and gen-
darmes were sent up to douai and
valenciennes heavy reinforcements
of police arrived at arras in trucks
the commercy cuirassiers camped
at vicoigne and the prefect of lille
was seen casting frightened glances
from the window of his auto as he
fled through the suburbs

  meanwhile the rioters were in
possession of the principal public
buildings in valenciennes the ca-
teau bridge already enfeebled by the
blue evil was finished off with dyna-
mite

  a number of the inhabitants fled
the peasants remained attached to
the earth in appearance quite indif-
ferent to what was going on they
hid their supplies of wheat and oats
in secure places welcomed the sol-
diers and liberators and complained
to the reds about the soldiers they
were amazingly uninterested in who
won

  a week went by in relative quiet

  one morning a fusillade became
audible in the direction of escaudain
leclair from his window saw a hun-
dred or more men go by carrying
bundles or dragging handcarts from
the neighboring farms the shop-
keepers barricaded their store fronts
windows could be heard closing
doors slamming

  in the afternoon the miners of
boriange filed by in almost military
formation their guns over their
shoulders

  that evening reassured by the
general silence leclair ventured out

the cankered orb of the moon oc-
casionally showed itself in a sky
darkened by masses of cloud a
damp breeze blew sadly through the
alleys rats driven from the mines
by the progress of the siderosis
made animated ink-blots in the
streets and disputed the accumu-

lated garbage with the starveling
dogs

  as at sidi-said leclair had heard
the plaint of the waters in revolt
and the memory of the circumstances
which had made him the instrument
of a perhaps irreparable disaster im-
posed itself once more on his mind
but what else could he have done
and of what use were these sterile
regrets  the die was cast the future
decided like the clockwork move-
ment which sets off an explosion to
a mine the blue evil was pursuing
its regular and irresistable course

  leclair trembled as he thought of
his old friends doomed to inglorious
deaths as surely as though he had
killed them with his own hands the
thought had become a veritable ob-
session with him and then he be-
gan to consider how small a part his
own feeble actions had played in set-
ting afoot the tornado which was
ravaging the whole world and his
scruples appeared absurd were not
all human enterprises condemned to
the same end-and what use was
there in tormenting himself

  but this melancholy imagining
pursued him the aspect of these
little sleeping streets with the
broken houses cut off sharply
against the moonlit sky like chinese
paintings the wandering dogs the
disorder and abandonment into
which everything had sunk the sol-
diers silent beside their arms with
their helmets reflecting the dancing
flames made upon a scene which
seemed to belong to some antique
and barbarous past epoch

  the clock on the city hall struck
ten sonorous strokes and a voice
could be heard singing a verse of a
bawdy song then silence gripped
the city once more

  hastening his steps leclair soon
arrived at croix-verte where
lefevre lived in a little house all by
himself the former factory super-
intendent appeared at an upper win-
dow with a lamp in his hand in an-

swer to his knock then said aston-
ished 

  what you here leclair whats
the trouble

  nothing i simply wished to see
you any news

  my word  no

  he showed the engineer into a
little office and pointed to the pile
of newspapers on an armchair

   the latest one is six days old it
seems that the federation has de-
clared a general strike and the gov-
ernment is out all the stores are
closed and to make things worse the
provision train they expected yester-
day hasnt got here yet i wouldnt
be surprised to find out that the
strikers had gotten hold of it but
i thought youd gone away

  mme morain is not well and im
afraid of the effect a long difficult
journey would have on her health
and im needed here for a while
yet

  what for

  the metal at aulnoy ive al-
ready mentioned it to you it repre-
s e n t s a fortune at the present
price   j

  i see interrupted lefevre
rather acidly you know which
side your bread is buttered on not
like me-after eight years of work
in the foundry being turned out
without resources and without a
job

  come said leclair lets be
frank i know you have made rather
a good thing out of the bethune
mines i need about fifty thousand
francs  

  why dont you borrow them from
mme morain

  you doubtless know there is a
contest about her husbands will
there are a good many creditors to
satisfy too the thing will take time
to work out in the courts

  ah really that man morain
if he had listened to me he never
would have been caught in such a
pinch look at samuel the defence
the death of iron	

committee paid him two million to
destroy steel which he later sold
back to the same committee sam-
uels got a sense of humor and
camus with his trucks and richard
and all the rest its fantastic when
one comes to think about it all
those cardboard cannons all those
leaky boats all those rotten rails
wished off on the army or the navy
or the reconstruction commission
they must have passed out no end
of cigars the brigands i

the rise of the reds 

with an irritated kick he dis-
turbed the log which was burn-
ing in the fireplace and began to
stride around the little room he
refit his pipe at the lamp and dis-
charged a couple of preliminary
smoke puffs

  just the same you cant make me
believe that mme morain cant get
several thousand francs in an emer-
gency ronceraies alone-

  true but its a question of time
let me explain mme morains big-
gest creditor is camus who wants
to seize the stocks of duro-fer to
satisfy his claim morain declared
some of them bat not all camus
who suspects something of the kind
is going to demand a new expert ex-
amination and this will show up the
presence of a concealed stock of
steel

  well you know how the new law
is about that sort of thing if we
can get rid of camus we can get
the intact alloys away to a safe place
somewhere the trains are all re-
quisitioned by the army but i can
get a couple of cars i have spoken
to a friend of mine at the central
office of the commission and he can
arrange it if he has enough cash for

expenses    naturally we would
recognize your services in a suitable
manner

  lefevre reflected

  i would have to have the strong-
est kind of guarantees the metal
stocks at denain steel and copper
both - theyre all shot you know
rat you have the amaury proper-
ties why not sell them

  times not right for it

  lefevre shrugged

  listen to me leclair you were
stupid in not unloading those things
now youre losing money on them
with every day that goes by and
youll never get out unload my
boy unload realize everything you
got and insist on payment in good
solid gold then put it into foreign
money precious stones and imper-
ishable products like rubber wood
ivory-there are the things that are
going to go up put your pile in a
safe place the time is coming when
you will be able to dictate your own
conditions

  the situation is worse than peo-
ple think capital is going abroad
credit is falling and the cost of liv-
ing is going up look at the inflation
its increasing like the temperature
of a sick man famines today and
murders tomorrow thats what
weve got to face and theres al-
ways the chance it will get worse

  as for me i dont really give a
damn in a few days the reds will
have the forges at trith and then
you can kiss your stocks of duro-
fer goodbye if you wish though-
listen ill tell you what ill do ill
buy out those stocks myself and give
you a good price for them as for
the coal properties i know a man
who is willing to take a chance on
any kind of desperate enterprise
shall i speak to him for you

  by all means i beg you to keep
all this confidential

  leclair swung suddenly round in
his chair

  what arent you alone


wonder story annual

rphe silhouette of a woman had
 appeared at the curtain of the
door for a moment that catlike mo-
tion that thin face    why its
fanny whats she doing here
lefevre youre an old rascal

  no its not what you think re-
plied the other hastily she just
got here this evening and in what
a state her clothes were all in rags
and she was half-crazy with exhaus-
tion could i throw her into the
street you know she lived in la
moliere the village was invaded by
lorraine and belgian refugees and
the people who had already put up
with a good deal refused to take
them in you know how those peas-
ants are-all right if you let them
alone but if you dont do what they
want capable of killing you on the
spot

  they turned the refugees out
with pitchforks things started to
pop when the red guards estab-
lished order in their usual fashion
this poor fanny had the bad luck
to fall into their hands and the reds
amused themselves with her you
know what that means there were
more than forty of them her shoul-
ders are simply raw where they beat
her

  lefevre swallowed hard bah
disgusting he concluded she
recognized your voice when you
hailed me even before i did but she
didnt want to come in what is
there between vou two anvway

  nothing

  ah if i thought    that girl is
not too prudish you know shall i
call her

  never mind its late and i must
be getting back said leclair ris-
ing

  lefevre held him back by the arm

  are you still thinking of going to
algeria 

  possibly

  my dear fellow youre making a
mistake these agricutural colonies
the promoters of the idea are back-

ing them only to get rid of the un-
employed here they stay home and
split up the dividends swindling the
human race is an industry that al-
ways has an impressive front in
your shoes id wait a while in any
case keep in touch with me will
you im sure there must be some
way out for you you havent the
business experience i have and i
can help you a lot but dont tell
anyone   anyone he repeated as
he accompanied the engineer to the
door

  what an imbecile thought le-
clair does he really think im going
to fall for that and to imagine
that mong all the people i knew it
was he tht i counted on the most

  thinking over the character of
lefevre contemplating that feroc-
ious egoism so shamelessly display-
ing itself that lack of morality al-
most delightful in its simple candor
he felt a trifle saddened

  lefevre was right-industry was
dead and one must seek some other
source of existence the important
thing was not being overcome as
yet he could see his own path only
with difficulty but one idea seemed
sensible-return to the earth

  enterprising men having decided
to build new lives were quitting the
cities by the thousands the gov-
ernment was encouraging these
exoduses giving enormous grants of
land in the colonies for the most in-
significant sums there were rushes
toward the more fertile lands like
the gold rushes of old

  special circumstances had already
determined the direction of his own
choice-morocco his desire to em-
bark made all difficulties seem light
he saw himself already the proprie-
tor of a great estate with fortune
smiling on his efforts the only real
obstacle was renee he had already
laid his project before her but she
would never consent to emigrate
her health moreover was not good
enough to support the trials of so
the death of iron



rude a type of existence

thus leclair soliloquized on the
way to ronceraies

  when he arrived his decision was
fixed he opened the question at
once

  my dear renee i doubt whether
you can find in paris the repose and
tranquility you need for the build-
ing- uo of your health

where do you suggest going
to a country where the sidcrosis
is unknown  morocco the climate
is excellent i have friends there
and you woud not be lone

  the properties acquired by morain
some time before his death had de-
preciated in value instead of selling
them he now suggested buying in
others at the same cheap price the
exploitation of the tract on a com-
mercial basis would thus become
possible in six months he felt cer-
tain he would be able to renew the
old vitality of the enterprise at
least the chance was worth taking
and finally it was the best means
of escaping from the creditors

  she repressed a gesture of irrita-
tion oh lets talk about it some
other time

  it will be too late then i dont
want to frighten you but i have the
impression that the state of affairs
here is serious we must make a
decision soon denain may fall into
the hands of the reds at any mo-
ment

  but renee was not afraid of them
they were she thought only un-
happy people who had been driven
to desperate measures by their
misery she had been halted in the
street by a patrol of young guards
the day before among them certain
workers from the morain factory
she had recognized them without
difficulty their leader a youth with
a timid air wore a red shirt and a
revolver attached to his hip with a
string he had excused himself
politely and had suggested that the

patrol see her home there were so
many bad eggs roaming the
streets these days she had discov-
ered that selevine had become one
of the most influential chiefs of the
communist party

 charming exclaimed leclair
and no doubt you expect him to
protect you if these brutes become
masters of the citv

  why not

  that is until the moment when
the soldiers stand him up against a
wall and shoot him like a mad dog
my dear renee t dont understand
your indulgence at all commu-
nists

  raymond she said after a mo-
ment you will go alone im going
to paris

  he protested but without genuine
enthusiasm paris was unsafe just
now he would never consent to such
a folly so many bonds united them
they could not separate now it was
in fact a matter already decided   
as soon as he could liquidate this
matter of the mines  

  if you wish to sell the properties
out i will be glad to make over to
you my own holdings

  i dont really need them and we
will have plenty of time to talk about
that my renee i am remembering
our first meeting our walks in the
park i realized then how much
alone you were and your sadness
went to my heart we understood
each other well then now it seems
you are escaping me what have i
done to displease you 

  nothing i know you a little
better thats all

  he did not even take the trouble
to protest he had obtained what
he wanted and already he was form-
ing a new plan-buy the adhesion of
vilcor and sell the properties to the
iron cartel certainly he would see
to it that renee did not lose he
was ready to act decently once the
interests of the young woman were
safeguarded he would feel more at

the dying steel

on the fifteenth of january the
brigades from arras assisted by
police forces attacked the rebellious
cities at valenciennes the reds not
having been disturbed for several
days had taken advantage of the
respite to fortify their positions
throwing up barricades

  a good estimate put their num-
ber at something like a hundred
thousand for the whole basin of the
north but the energetic elements
were much less numerous and were
in a sense drowned in a population
which while hostile enough to the
defenders of order was passive and
desired quiet more than anything
else

  they could all have been brought
round by peaceable means but the
government dominated by a finan-
cial oligarchy which had been
rendered ferocious by its money
losses and pushed on by the fright-
ened bourgeoisie wished nothing
but a quick and implacable repres-
sion of the revolt

  by an ingenious maneuver gen-
eral fremont commander of the
first corps had isolated the rebels
and cut off their main masses from
one another with chains of fortified
posts those who tried to reunite
ran into the military strongholds or
encountered a barrage of tanks and
armored cars ready to spit death
from every gun the rebel message
bearers were captured and their
wireless traffic systematically
jammed causing the greatest con-
fusion in their ranks

the international labor federa-

t i o n launched an appeal to the
proletariat of all countries and by
a narrow majority voted for a gen-
eral strike but at the same time ex-
pressed its disapproval of the revo-
lutionary form the movement had
taken three days later all yvork
ceased in berlin munich and west-
ern prussia the horses were
brought up out of the mines ships
were anchored in deserted harbors

  as the workers left their shops at
sheffield glasgow and birmingham
sanguinary brawls between them
and the police broke out sailors
from scotland brought in to replace
the striking stevedores mutinied
the order for the interruption of
work reached italy and the dispos-
sessed factory-owners had to make
room for councils of their laborers

  nevertheless in france itself
there were disagreements between
the syndicalists and the workmens
councils minority groups campaign-
ing actively for their ideas pushed
the combat with vigor and gained
new adherents daily all of them
exalted the social revolution by
every means and set fire to inflam-
mable imaginations

  the premier succeeded in over-
coming the movement a former
socialist who flattered himself that
he was able to retain the confidence
of all the advanced parties he
showed no pity to the strikers once
he got into power

  in the chamber before a packed
house he described the state of the
capitol attacked in the most vital
parts of its organization his voice
was pathetic as he told how agita-
tors as stupid as they were crim-
inal were trying to bring about the
fall of his government in the inter-
est of the country and since all
methods of persuasion had now
failed he would attempt to bring
them back to more healthy views
and a respect for established institu-
tions and the power of the law by a
series of exemplary punishments
the death of iron	

  the greater part of the socialists
approved his decision meanwhile
making certain reservations by long
parliamentary experience

  other questions were then con-
sidered

  deputy lebon demanded large
votes of funds for the navy which
had been hard hit by the blue evil

  with the unanimity which great
causes can inspire with the patriotic
clan of the days of the great revolu-
tion the deputies voted the neces-
sary sacrifices

tn a rainy dawn the inhabitants

  of denain saw a regiment of blue
guards go by preceded by their
colonel the helmeted infantry were
five thousand strong then came a
black brigade which was to be em-
ployed for specially dangerous tasks
as their native ferocity woke under
the excitement of combat in a man-
ner beautiful to behold

  the main body of the army ar-
rived before the first barricade an
inextricable tangle of rafters rails
and bricks torn from the neighbor-
ing factories to outflank the ob-
s t a c  e one would have to pass
through a maze of narrow streets
perhaps fight their way through
them the colonel conferred with
his officers

  already an old man with a timid
air and a greying mustache beneath
his glasses he looked more like a
professor who had grown bleached
over some recondite study than a
warrior in his personal makeup he
exhibited a not uncommon paradox
the association of barbaric tradi-
tions with cold speculative intelli-
gence his eyes grown dim over
scientific books contemplated the
fortification of these misguided men
with something like pity and he
wished he had a means of overcom-
ing them without too bloody a con-
flict

  the action began somewhere in
the suburbs a maehinegun rattled

distantly and everyone leaped to at-
tention lieutenant dutertre mount-
ed on his favorite horse came up at
a gallop

  mon colonel i have had three
men killed and blanchettes knee has
been grazed by a bullet look how it
bleeds the hrutes they told us
their arms were unusable shall we
attack 

  wait a minute    lieutenant
you know your blacks not too much
energy now

  oh mon colonel they are all as
gentle as lambs

  well you understand what we
are after prisoners not barbarity
and above all no souvenirs after
all they are frenchmen

  those frenchmen over there are
our worst enemies

  at this moment a messenger ar-
rived from chalons for the colonel
reading over the note he brought
the officer turned pale and then gave
several rapid orders the lieutenant
had an amused light in his blue eyes
well were really going to begin
ah you bums over there mon col-
onel youre going to see something
really good

  down the empty street pushed by
the hands of men advanced a
strange engine of war all metal had
been rigorously eliminated from its
construction armored in fibre-
cement with reservoirs of com-
pressed air topped with a moving
tube one would have said it was
some prehistoric monster the idea
of the invention which was alto-
gether new was due to general
fremont a humanitarian who
dreamed of bringing about world
peace by fear through augmenting
the means of destruction to such a
point that men would no longer
fight

  the opportunity for trying out
this new type of tank designed for
use against enemies from beyond
the borders was too tempting to be
missed and it had been hastily
	wonder story annual

rushed through to completion the
colonel chewed the ends of his mous-
tache and gazed at the monster with
disapproval he liked fine horses
cannons sabres he was a man of
tradition

  tell me lieutenant this gas no
   youre sure    it isnt dead-
ly

  the other gave an imperceptible
shrug what an idea aloud he
said mon colonel the shells are
filled with chlorosedemil

 what

  chloro-se-demil narcotic va-
pors you will see theyll drop off
to sleep like babies no pain

there was a subdued whistling
the fibrite globe fell a little short
burst softly like an egg permitting
the escape of a smoke whose curls
rolled lazily along the ground gre-
nades that raised fountains of gravel
and dust around the tank began to
burst and the machine profited by
the occasion to approach a little
nearer an odor of chlorine reached
the colonels nostrils the soldiers
could be heard coughing in spite of
the absence of wind the yellowish
gas was flowing back in their direc-
tion and through a gap in the arti-
ficial fog the top of the barricade
became visible the lieutenant re-
turned at a gallop

  whats happening

  the dirty rats they have in-
stalled a machine i dont know what
it is a pump a wind machine or
something that drives the gas back-
wards my men are blinded and
spitting blood but how did they do
it mine ventilators i suppose
listen you can hear the motors   
its incredible we must - whats
that

  the colonel lifted his glasses and
looked

  theyve stopped firing some-
things happening

  with a cry a group of the rebels
had run from behind the coal pile to

seek cover elsewhere those in the
open flattened themselves to the
ground beside guns that had rotted
to uselessness overwhelmed at the
prospect of being without defence
their comrades tried to rally in
spite of bleeding hands and faces
scorched by bursting guns but every
shot directed toward the troops was
only another weapon against them-
selves

  their chief cried out fight on
-but what could they fight with
teeth and nails  the grenades were
bursting among them and they had
no reply the infantry was advanc-
ing in front others were already
shooting them down from the rear
of the barricades they were with-
out defence facing death

  on a neighboring roof a machine-
gun blew up in a burst of flame and
something like a sack of meal rolled
down the tiles and crashed to the
ground out of the shadows surged
a face crying with the torment of
the tortured body that belonged to
it the insurgents last arms be-
trayed them

  their courage gave way all but a
little desperate group abandoned
their position and fled by any route
they could find the rout was com-
plete

  and now the ardor of battle grew
strong in the soldiers the dragoons
rode down the rebels in the factory
yards and streets sabering the fly-
ing without pity the thick smoke
which had enveloped the field of
action began to lift and the wounded
were to be seen among the broken
stones and the iron debris around
the barricade

  there remained in the factory it-
self a thousand or more men these
surrendered at the first summons

  meanwhile the nd squadron was
carrying the barricades at est by
assault after a desperate struggle
at herin they got across the escaut
and surrounded the city hall where
the reds shot sang and shouted like
the death of iron



so many maniacs the black troops
fired two volleys and then charged
up the stairs they came down again
a little later laughing and with
scarlet spots on their brown hands

   the two leaders of the insurrec-
tion perished in this engagement
someone had set fire to the old build-
ing and it was soon destroyed with
its dead

   the soldiers returned slowly in
little groups panting and covered
with perspiration after the exalta-
tion of the combat an indefinable
discomfort overwhelmed them far
away cries could be heard from the
saint roch quarter where the third
hussars had surrounded a group
the vanquished had poured petrol
over everything before taking to
flight and a nauseating smoke rolled
over the whole neighborhood

  the horrors of fratricidal war
struck home to these tired men

   the rain had stopped little pools
of water reflected the gray calm
sky the inhabitants began to stick
heads out of windows exhibiting
frightened eyes in faces haggered
with insomnia some of them even
came out to insult the prisoners be-
ing led away to the fortress of mal-
plaquet surrounded by gendarmes
they marched along in silence in
clothes wet through by the rain

 lready soldiers from the en-
gineers corps were reestablish-
ing the means of communication
clearing up the railroads and streets
a poster announced to the popula-
tion that plentiful provisions would
soon be at hand while waiting for
their arrival everyone was urged to
restrain their appetite as far as pos-
sible court martials were estab-
lished for the trial of all grave crimes
such as armed rebellion and pillag-
ing the syndicates and workmens
councils were dissolved and public
meetings were forbidden

government engineers everywhere
were notified that they were subject

to the orders of the military author-
ities and the state of siege declared
for the basin of the north included
the requisitioning of all machines
and buildings necessary for the pub-
lic use an economic commission
furnished with dictatorial powers
opened sittings at lille the inhabi-
tants were exhorted to be patient to
be calm and to work

  under the orders of the procurer-
general suspicious places were
searched and a good many arrests
were made but without much suc-
cess so far as suppressing extremist
agitation went the repressive meas-
ures only seemed to fill the ranks of
the associations with new members
after the breakup of the great or-
ganizations new parties were born
on all sides out of the confusion of
ideas-the vigilantes the populists
the federalists the volunteers of
order a hundred factions that as-
serted their interests and promoted
antagonistic ambitions

  the vigilantes composed of the
socialists who disapproved of revolu-
tionary methods and who were de-
termined to reestablish order and
security by any possible means
grew in number from day to day
united by oaths they practiced a
rude form of self-discipline and in-
culcated the more spartan virtues
wore a uniform of a cut at once ro-
mantic and military and adopted the
fasces and axe of the roman licters
as their insignia the integrity of
their principles did not permit them
to make compromises they re-
proached the head of the govern-
ment with venality unskillfulness
and softness and this point of view
gave them the support of the na-
tional militia to which they expected
some day to oppose the forces of the
red syndicates

  at amiens the vigilantes refused
to turn over to the authorities de-
serters from the army who had
taken refuge in their ranks similar
clashes took place at nancy while

at brest marseilles and toulon

flight

renee who had been dozing
opened astonished eyes

  the carriole was getting away
from the laboring district now and
the wheels were bumping over pieces
of wood and dislocated rails puddles
of water covered with a scum of
coal-dust were stagnating in the
streets where the barricades only
half removed still exhibited their
rafters and sections of barbed wire
no human movement animated the
houses behind their closed blinds

  shivering in the damp cold she
burrowed deeper into her furs and
steadied her tired head on her hand
her eyelids heavy with a night of
wakefulness closed insensibly she
saw leclair again not living but as
she had recognized him among the
corpses of the day before his face
was twisted with his last agony his
hair matted with blood his eyelids

drawn back from glassy eyes the
broken roof of the hospital had let
through a shaft of light which
struck these sightless faces drab-
colored like cinder or wood

  a medical officer told her how
they had found the body at aulnoy
where the stocks of steel were piled
after the reds had been sacking the
place on the forehead was the mark
of a blow from some heavy instru-
ment and the hand was still tight-
ened around the grip of a revolver
the voice of the medical officer had
been slow and quiet it seemed some-
how far away unreal and without
any relation to her own existence
she tried to imagine the last drama
but the features of her late friend
dissolved in the fog of the past

  a sensation of disgust mingled
with her pity as she realized it was
easier for her to picture that mur-
dered body delivered over to the
horrors of decay than to recall how
leclair had looked full of youth and
life she accused herself of lack of
feeling and cursed her owrn detest-
able imagination poor raymond
who had begged her to go away with
him fearing these revolutionary
struggles with good reason he had
predicted an ignominious death for
selevine and that death had struck
down leclair himself while the rus-
sian who had passed through a
thousand violences was sitting there
beside her safe and sound it
seemed to renee like a treason
against divine justice

  i will never be able to under-
stand thought renee searching
her mind for the reasons that had
led her to defend selevine to the
point of imperilling her own secur-
ity

  he had come by night to hide in
the park around her house wounded
and pursued the shriek of a whistle
had awakened him with a jerk from
a fitful rest one could hear the
sound of the water and faraway
clamors the river was piling the
the death of iron



remnants of bridges against its
banks and black soldiers were ex-
ploring the neighborhood with
torches held at arms length their
clubs fell dully on the heads of
pillagers and incendiaries selevine
was there in the shadow his head
bare his clothes torn trembling
with the reaction from the strug-
gle

  the rage of defeat convulsed his
features most of his comrades had
been killed in the attack on the bar-
ricades others had been caught
later how he had escaped he him-
self did not know he was breathing
heavily like an animal repeating
the brutes the atrocious brutes
and filled with a mad desire to kill
kill kill

  but she had drawn him to her
had enveloped him in loving arms
herself shivering and had breathed
out words of supplication and en-
treaty rest here  dont abandon
me    im alone im afraid and
she had made him hide himself re-
covering enough of her strength to
lie to the searchers and send them
off in another direction

  nevertheless she despised him a
little for having given in to her for
having so easily accepted this preci-
pitate flight her voice was aggres-
sive as she said

  it was your red guards who
assassinated raymond and not vul-
gar bandits as you tried to make me
believe i am sure of it now only
your extremists would have wanted
to steal arms and tools

  selevine who had not said three
words since the previous day made
a gesture but did not unclench his
teeth

  you might at least answer when
i speak to you

  my dear renee i dont under-
stand the reason for these re-
proaches

  im not reproaching you with
anything she said with angry
energy

  they had to stop to let a convoy
of prisoners go by hands chained
together they seemed a troop of
beasts on the way to the slaughter-
house she looked at selevines face
without being able to see a trace of
any emotion at all imprinted there
the lamentable procession disap-
peared around a turn in the road

the carriole entered the suburban
district which surrounded escau-
din with a black fringe dotted with
gardens the houses began to space
out and give way to stony fields
bordered with the ruins of factories
between their double piles of coal
and clinkers

  passersby were rare first but
beyond aniche they began to en-

ine had driven from their holes like

it passed and was presently fol-

came a series of odd vehicles collect-
ed from everywhere and loaded with
domestic objects rustics driving

cameos by the sweeping berets they
wore a group of men belonging to
no recognized formation mercenar-
ies deserters from the army pillag-
ers of factories who showed through
the holes in their ragged garments
bodies corroded by contact with the
rotten iron

  further on a stalled horse-truck
was holding up traffic wrapped in
his sheepskin coat an old man was
trying to make his fallen horse rise
the crowd simnly collected around
the obstacle with stupid obstinacy
the old peasant continued to beat
the animal with the handle of his
whip jokers offered ridiculous ad-
vice  a few well-placed bombs would
reanimate the lazy animal they said
one of thlem patted the carter on
the shoulder

  what have you got in your sacks
are you deaf grandpa  what-
plaster are you going to build a
house laughter the man looked
around with a frightened air his
simple face running with perspira-
tion a drop of kindliness seemed
to filter into the hearts of the crowd
willing hands began to tug at the
wheels shoulders gave friendly
pushes to the cart it was partly
unloaded but when one of the sacks
leaked clean white flour oil was
poured on the flames of the mobs
resentment selevine made an at-
tempt to intervene but mouths vo-
mited obscene jokes and curses at
him

  renee was the object of glances
that made her burrow down in the
furthest corner of the carriole

  one of the vagabonds leaped on
the step of the vehicle gripping the
handles with a slash of his whip
selevine made him release his hold
then flogged the horse into rapid
movement a shower of stones and
curses accompanied their flight

  selevine looked at renees fright-
ened face

  dont be upset by a little thing
like that he said there are plenty

of such incidents

  youre very reassuring

  until the communists come into
power and reestablish order but
peonle have to live

  to live thought renee whats
the use of it where can one find
the strength necessary to carry on
an unattractive existence in which
the weak are everywhere trampled
on  she felt a sudden need of rest
only to isolate oneself in some
secure retreat where one would
never hear the blue evil mentioned
again to forget oneself-are those
unrealizable desires 

  a pleasant remembrance floated
into the field of her thoughts she
saw herself once again a young girl
in the scotch citv where she had
been educated the stones of the
boarding house were covered with
ivy and wisteria whose leaves shiv-
ered in the sea-breeze a delicate
light bathed the neighboring hill-
sides young men played bare-
headed in the green countryside
and among the laughing gardens
one of them had kissed her on the
lips one day how sweet life had
seemed then

  a feeling of discouragement filled
her at the thought of remaining for
the rest of her life without a real
friend in the world and a murmur
of loneliness escaped from her lips
im all alone

some tender emotion woke in
selevine he was suddenly aware
of an unformulated hope his mouth
became dry and an artery beat in
his temple as though in a dream
he heard the young woman say
why is it always necessary to
struggle against the evil deeds of
men vanquished by destiny suc-
cumbing to all the evils they will
find strength enough to hate there
are times when i find myself fright-
ened by this inexplicable world
just the same said selevine
they are no more than our unhappy

brothers his voice was a trifle
hoarse

  heres soumain he remarked a
few minutes later in half an hour
well be at campeau

  a monotony of roofs appeared in
the distance behind a screen of
trees the sky grew clearer above
the red tiles

  children who were playing in a
brook stopped to inspect the new-
comers a soldier bearing the in-
signia of the council on his tunic
emerged from a guardhouse and
verified their papers

  the horse seemed at the end of
his strength selevine leaped out to
examine his feet two of the shoes
were broken perplexed he stopped
at a farm whose walls reached to the
roadside through a screen of trees
the owner of the place came down
to meet them quieting his dog
after having heard selevines ex-
planation of their plight he said it
would be impossible to make repairs
anywhere near there did not re-
main a usuable horseshoe for ten
miles around

  having made this declaration the
good man insisted that the young
lady stop and rest a little he cut a
loaf of bread and put some milk and
butter on the table selevine offered
to let him keep the horse and carriole
until they came back to call for it
but renee resolved to get rid of them
at all costs accepted the absurd price
the peasant offered without demur

  her companion urged her to hurry
on three miles still separated them
from montigny and time was pass-
ing their host told them of a short
cut that would take them there
quickly

  the countryside was surprisingly
calm leaving the village they tra-
versed little roads through fields that
had become like sponges the land
gorged with rain was damp under
the rotten vegetation and smelled
faintly of fever a marsh reflected
the vague color of the sky and the

confused forms of the clouds bodies
of various sorts rotted in holes be-
neath a covering of flies renee gave
a little cry at seeing among the
weeds where it had lain concealed
until they passed close a body with
bare feet pointing at the road a
little furtive animal fled as they
approached

 when they reached montigny
night had already begun to fall this
mining city had recently been the
scene of violent riots between the
laborers and the troops the blue
evil had ravaged everything

 in the evening mist which
drowned the whole region not a sin-
gle light was burning only the re-
flection of some fire appeared on the
horizon behind the leprous houses
like cyclopean towers the forges of
bruille lifted above the black mass
of the buildings the huge tubes that
only yesterday had been crowned
with flame now forever silenced

  near the railroad station a patrol
of dragoons were warming them-
selves around a fire a resigned mul-
titude pressed along the platforms
and overflowed onto rails reddened
by two weeks of disuse further on
several pieces of railroad equipment
were visible a signal tower a few
electrical pylons with trailing wires
and the white globes of lamps

tense readiness for anything she
might give them like little animals
when she tossed them a few sous
they fled disputing among them-
selves

  toward six oclock a sanitary train
going to lille was announced a lit-
tle later the locomotive came smok-
ing into the station at once all the
travelers precipitated themselves
onto it the guards did not even try
to keep them back the train was
covered with them-on the roofs
along the runways and on the bump-
ers

  back keep back called voices
unavailing

  the gendarmes finally succeeded
in clearing the track in front of the
train and it left

  selevine inquired about an inn
where they might be able to spend
the night renee remained silent
walking with difficulty her eyelashes
falling onto her pale cheeks in-
finitely tired

  the wind tossed the edge of her
scarf the night smelled wild as
though burned with the distant fires
somewhere a sign-board half loos-
ened swung creaking to and fro in
the sky the clouds flew rapidly pst

  a sense of irreparable disaster en-
veloped the young woman the
weight of a sorrow she had not
sensed before seemed to fall on her
shoulders in the space of an instant
a sudden vertigo transformed the
appearance of the whole world to
that of a nightmare already experi-
enced between her and the outer
world a reminiscence seemed to have
been interposed like an impalpable
screen and everything she saw was
half-hidden and inconsistent

  she staggered selevine gripped
her by the arm and asked

  you are tired renee

 she responded without being
aware of what she was saying

  no raymond oh pardon   
the reality strangled her while the
other part of her mind still followed

the trail of some unattainable vision
the narrow street surged before her
open eyes nothing broke the si-
lence selevine halted before an inn
and allowed the remains of an iron
door-knocker to fall against the door
the wood trembled slightly and an
old woman her face angry beneath
her bonnet came to open for them
they went into a room where there
was an odor of dried apples the old
woman busied herself in the kitchen
threw a few sticks of wood into the
fireplace and finally appeared with a
rustic supper tf which they could
not eat a mouthful

  selevine asked for hot tea and
eau-de-vie he did not ordinarily
care for strong drinks but this eve-
ning thoroughly tired he poured out
several draughts that coursed
through his veins to fill him with an
agreeable warmth lighting his pipe
he hid himself in a cloud of smoke

  the candle made shadows dance
along the walls and among the furni-
ture selevine meditated in a con-
fused manner on the fugitive pic-
tures of the last days-his preci-
pitate flight the hordes of emi-
grants the people attacked by the
blue evil in its human manifesta-
tion the prisoners a mother tear-
lessly watching her sick child little
larval human beings begging for
something to eat with heads enor-
mously out of proportion their every
appearance painful

selevine wondered what had
happened to him of what curi-
ous neurosis had he become the vic-
tim he felt barbarous instincts stir
in the depths of his mind

  he shivered passed a hand across
his forehead and sighed with eyes
that had become a trifle haggard he
turned toward renee

  some days ago i was working in
a suburb of valenciennes nearly
all the houses were deserted one of
them attracted my attention how-
ever the door swung to and fro in
the death of iron	

the wind and higher up a window
clung to a dirty rag of curtain by
means of a piece of broken glass i
went in and almost stumbled across
the corpse of a little girl

  obsessed by another drama renee
said

  it was your red guards who mur-
dered raymond the poor man whose
courage your friends could never
pardon killed by some scoundrel
all social overturns bring some
ignoble characters up from the
depths they are the dregs deposited
by centuries of ignorance and misery
now slowly rising to the surface of
society the most noble enterprises
are touched in this way

  but renee continued with irrita-
tion

  all that is nothing but the
phrases of a doctrinaire i only know
one thing-if you and others like you
did not provoke disorders raymond
would still be alive its very little
consolation to know that the mur-
derers are not inscribed on the rolls
of the communist party bandits
revolutionaries pillagers are easily
mixed up and separating them out is
too much of a job for me

  and she added

  poor raymond before anyone
else thought of it he understood the
magnitude of the peril of the blue
evil and the necessity of abandon-
ing the factory  if we had only
followed his advice ah he knew
what was behind those nice words of
yours justice and liberty he was
no cloudy idealist he knew your
friends

  too well said the russian in a
stifled voice in some cases   
laval for example

  what are you daring to insinu-
ate demanded renee its shame-
ful of you what did your precious
laval mean to raymond i ask you 
when i think that his murderers are
still unpunished oh i could take
terrible reprisals i want revenge
the communists deported the

unemployed without food or lodging
more than five thousand workers
assassinated isnt that enough for
you  do you know that in the sec-
tion of which i was a member not
one man escaped death 

  except you my congratulations
there is nothing for you to do now
but enjoy your well-earned rest and
receive deputations the world is in-
dulgent toward anarchists who re-
pent

  your sarcasms hurt me renee
no none of us can ever take any re-
pose or enjoy the most simple pleas-
ures of life we are excluded from
the rights of humanity as for me
my work is not yet finished we
were beaten but it is nothing here
where it was born the movement of
liberation will grow and ultimately
expend across the whole world
then the lesson you got wasnt
enough for you and you are going
to continue on the track of i dont
know what dream to make new
dupes to prepare for new massacres
you havent the slightest pity for
the unhappy people you draw into
these futile adventures what do you
expect look out you wont have
the chance to get away when things
go wrong again as you did this time
selevines face became flushed
this is an unexpected reproach
you saved my life dont make me
regret it

  the young womans anger did not
cool

  all the same you have a queer
method of showing your apprecia-
tion for the hospitality of the coun-
try where you have found asylum
and protection

  i could answer you on that point
in a good many ways but whats
the use wait hear me-there are
necessary murders just as there are
sick men who can be cured only by
cutting away portions of their bod-
ies what does a little suffering mat-

views what has changed you
you ask what kind of a man
are you 

  she looked him full in the face
selevine i am going to put one
question to you and i want an answer
without any evasions are you sin-
cere 

  what 

  yes do you really believe you
are working for the good of human-
ity in destroying the organization of
society  are you a revolutionist by
conviction-or by dilettantism
but-

  answer me

  truly  i dont know

  oh

  i swear that i would be ready to
sacrifice my life for my ideals hear
me renee when a man once finds
his life work he must follow his
course blindly without futile returns
to examine himself doubt-the evil
of doubt agonizes our best mo-
ments

e remained silent for a mo-
ment and then began again i
embroiled myself in the combat and
yet if you knew how far i really am
from all  

  he trailed off seeming to be ab-
sorbed in his thoughts then lifted
his head and looked at renee with
concentrated attention

  a certain sickly grace had lighted
up her features her skin showed the
fine tracery of the veins at her tem-
ples her neck seemed to bend be-
neath the weight of the necklace that
encircled it

  this feebleness left him without
anything to say he kissed her sud-
denly on the forehead the eyebrows
but she repulsed him gently her
eyes filled with tears

  his conscience suddenly disappear-
ing he strained her lissome body to
him overcame her feeble resistance
and their lips met in a kiss wet with
tears and the kiss stirred selevine
to the depths of his being but he

felt she was far from him drawn in
on herself inert then with an effort
of his whole will power he let her go
and went out into the night that
would cover his sadness filled with
emotions he had never before ex-
perienced

     hardly had he gone to bed
when in contradiction to his usual
habit he fell asleep at once his mind
entered on the borders of an inco-
herent nightmare then as though
he could change the course of things
at will he found himself walking
along a solitary road walls across
which roses were growing attracted
his attention sometimes an iron
grill permitted one to see gardens
and bars of light peeked the silent
forms of trees which extended their
branches out toward a distant sea
mists filled a low valley there were
olive trees along the edge of a brook
and a chimney was smoking near a
road which the winter sun had paved
with pale gold the countryside was
familiar to him but the dream threw
its air of unreality across everything

  as it was sunday people were
walking about the streets and sele-
vine recognized some of them a
woman in mourning carrying a cat
in her arms an acidulous old man
a chesty youth a too-nervous child
which moved its head constantly and
wrung its hands from time to time
he walked slowly wondering about
their illnesses warming himself in
the rays of the declining sun

  a little old man came into the
park carrying a fiddle his white
beard covered his chest he stopped
lifted his head and passed his bow
across the strings attracted by the
cry of the strings the passersby ap-
proached noiselessly the old man
leaned on his cane the woman with
the cat wept the nervous child fixed
its magnetic eyes on space

  half-forgotten remembrances and
old phantoms surged into his con-
sciousness with the air of things
which are not and could not have
the death of iron	

existed there was the light in the
house loved ones who had died his
unhappy youth his wasted life oh
my brothers thought selevine con-
templating their destiny and his own

  he was suddenly aware of their
troubles the days they had spent
each bearing its load of lost oppor-
tunities and pains without result
and their true faces appeared to him
across their ephemeral physical
masks people too tired overcome by
life afraid of death he felt the
irony of their existences and burdens
so rhuch like his own

  nevertheless something about
these people now fixed in attitudes
of abnormal and grotesque desola-
tion made him uneasy

  the shadows in the park length-
ened a dead leaf turned and fell
the waxen skin the salient bones-
what was it in the twilight gloom
under the shadow of time they
stood angular and stiff they dreamed
of things obscure devastating smiles
on their painted wooden faces

  it isnt possible said selevine to
himself perplexed held back by fear
from seeing what he was certain he
would see approaching one of the in-
credible mannequins till it fell to the
ground at his touch and he fumbled
in its breast and stomach to draw
forth hands full of straw and cotton
as he laughed laughed softly at hav-
ing been taken in by appearances
and believing that this could be true

  waking with a jerk selevine re-
called his dream the dawn was ris-
ing a swallow went by under the
milky way crying its little cry and
like an unhappy infant he burst into
tears over his own unhappiness

xvii

in paris

the next morning selevine went
out to get information about the
probable arrival of a train he

walked rapidly brandishing his
cudgel his nostrils dilated with the
odor of day the wind blew across
the cracking ruins of the houses 
bent the rustling young poplars in
a manner somehow cheerful

  emerging from the railroad sta-
tion he ran into lefevre who smed
in a hurry and much annoyed when
selevine had answered a counle of
questions he repeated for the sec-
ond time as though incredulous

	then mme morain is with you 

  his eyes hardly concealed a heavy
irony selevine was tempted to
smash his fist into the sneering face

  mme morain is on her way to
her aunts home in paris

  its a bit odd all the same

 what demanded selevine
sharply

  our meeting here this coinci-
dence

  he had come on from peruwelz
in a four-seater car but the motor
which had functioned thus far
through some miracle of the sider-
osis refused to carry him any fur-
ther

  selevine demanded imperiously
that lefevre take mme morain and
himself on to paris the ex-factory
superintendent though not at all
willing to oblige the russian whom
he had always detested finally yield-
ed to the importunities of his inter-
locutor with a bad grace he took
him to the end of the town where
the car had been garaged in the barn
of a little farm selevine examined
the motor found the cause of the
trouble and fixed it after a fashion
with the aid of what implements
they could find

  at the  hotel des negociants
they found mme morain already
wrapped in her coat she made a
gesture which selevine had not time
to interpret for twto gendarmes ris-
ing suddenly out of the dark at the
back of the room demanded to see
the papers of the travelers renee
remained motionless hardly daring


wonder story annual

to breathe but selevine with a
smile exhibited papers that had been
carefully forged and the inquisi-
tors excused themselves and left

  lefevre seated himself at the ta-
ble and terrorized the servant by
the demands of an appetite sharp-
ened by half a day of fasting

  im going on to nice he ex-
plained the southern part of
france has suffered little you can
get plenty to eat there when youre
hungry but you have to pay the
price for it but these cities here
are full of emigrants without count-
ing the foreigners who are around
temporarily taking advantage of
the exchange to live on nothing

  he turned toward renee

  i tried hard to get raymond to
leave denain as much as three
months ago i can still see him as he
last showed up at my house when
he tried to get me to take on some
queer business deal in which part of
your holdings were involved i told
him i would do what i could for
him he mentioned you too mad-
ame and i would be very happy if
my small knowledge of financial af-
fairs could be of any use to you you
may dispose of me as you wtould of
our late friend

  and as the young woman was
thanking him he added

  friends were made to help one
another in a pinch

  speaking of leclair he referred
to the arrest of laval and remarked
that he attached no real importance
to rumors

  leclair met fanny at my house
and they saw each other after that-
just how frequently i dont know
she had seenher former lover and
the two mefi hated each other it
seems that laval wanted to get hold
of the stocks at aulney and fanny
intervened in favor of leclair

  or against him

  you know howr it is with wom-
en-

  yes i know said selevine in a

cutting voice fanny was at your
house for a while wasnt she and
she knew about the existence and
whereabouts of the stocks of duro-
fer

  its possible said lefevre
avoiding the russians glance and
pulling out his watch he added

  i think its time we were start-
ing

all three climbed into the car
and lefevre took the wheel
when they got outside the city he
speeded up a road opened its fly-
ing lines before them the fields on
either side flowed past monotonous-
ly patched here and there with
groups of beech or apple trees slid-
ing through the clouds a ray of sun-
light made the roofs of douchy glow
around the clock-tower they found
the streets empty the houses aban-
doned and the only inn boarded up

  the auto went on they passed
through arras at nine oclock in the
evening as they drew nearer to
paris they began to encounter
barred-off bridges that forced them
into a series of fantastic detours a
locomotive which had rolled down
an embankment barred the road at
one place fences torn down paving
torn up broken glass in the middle
of the streets an indescribable dis-
order everywhere bore mute wit-
ness to the popular fury during the
preceding week

  from mount valerien a search-
light lost in the shadows of falling
day threw its shaft of light across
the fog above the city and lighted
up the vapor like a halo

        

  mme lafont was extremely fond
of her niece renee after the death
of m morain she had written that
she would accomplish even the im-
possible to facilitate renees ex-
istence if the latter came to live with
her but every day events were more
the death of iron



discouraging to her kind heart her
little fortune gradually melted her
friends disappeared this isolation
in a great city made the situation
particularly painful for her she
had a peculiarily expansive char-
acter and she suffered from having
no one to confide in but renee or
selevine the latters distracted air
froze her justest complaints on her
lips the russian who visited the
house assiduously was far from be-
ing a welcome visitor mme lafont
was not in ignorance of his part in
the communist troubles and she con-
sidered him a compromising visitor
perhaps a man actually wanted by
the police nevertheless his respect-
ful attentions to renee the services
which he was forever performing
for her modified this resentment
slightly

  selevine had kept up cordial re-
lations with barrois and had per-
suaded the latter to care for mme
morains interests at denain as
chief engineer of the reconstruction
committee this help could be inval-
uable

  after a long period during which
barrois gave no sign of life he
arrived at the dwelling of the two
women one day he had not forgot-
ten his old friends but he had his
duties and they left him little lei-
sure he seemed uneasy his face
was drawn quite different from
what renee had known of him his
job was the reorganization of means
of communication and the provision
of food-supplies in the devastated
regions with regard to what he was
doing at that particular moment he
was vague

  mme lafont trotted out her usual
list of complaints but the engineer
hardly heard her

  a single subject occupied all his
thoughts-the malady of metal his
life had become a series of days
of back-breaking toil and nights
without sleep driven at frantic
speed during the day his nervous

machine kept up its work at night
and when he tried to shut his eyes
for a moment of repose he could
see nothing but the disordered cities
the ruined countryside burned and
rotting buildings

  we have organized a trucking
service he recounted for the
whole northern basin and the de-
partment du pas de calais right
down to the belgian border that is
from the head of the railroads where
there are a few locomotives still
moving on duro-fer rails from
luxembourg on all the locomotives
are under lead armor

  every day we make new maps of
the danger zone and the disease
spreads wider with our markings of
chinese ink in the whole region
from anzin to creusot there is a
provision shortage in spite of all we
can do one train at roubaix was
literally submerged by famished
bands and we finally had to drive
them off with jets of steam thou-
sands of abandoned children are
wandering about in the fields the
hospitals are swamped and they no
longer make any effort to count the
dead organisms enfeebled by hun-
ger are peculiarly subject to the hu-
man siderosis

  mme lafont looked up

  isnt there any remedy

  none preventive measures are
the only things that are any use

  i was going to ask your advice
its about renee you are in connec-
tion with graham and the big men
of the reconstruction you ought to
be able to find some buyer for the
madeleine mine

  barrois felt an interior shiver he
knew that the mine was hopelessly
lost but mme lafonts air was so
supplicating that he promised to aid
in the impossible project of its sale

less than a week later he re-
turned with a friend a rather
puffy fat man named colson a meat
packer who had realized an amazing


wonder story annual

fortune by selling slightly damaged
stores of beef this important per-
sonage had the air of distinction
and frankness which distinguished
most of his class renees aristo-
cratic mien interested him from
their first meeting and while he was
busily scraping his nails with his
pen-knife he cast speculative glances
at her estimating her cash value
he liked her was disposed to set a
most generous figure for her in view
of the decline in feminine values in
comparison with those of edible
meat and ended by offering his pro-
tection in exchange for certain small
favors but they were refused him
and a project in which sentiment
and interest could have been com-
bined in the proportions recognized
by the usages of polite society per-
ished with it went the last hopes of
mme lafont

  that lady held selevine respon-
sible for the check although it is
difficult to see where he was to
blame the attitude of renee seemed
to justify that of her aunt she
avoided seeing the russian alone
exhibited a bored air when he called
and discouraged his every attempt
at conversation by her silences
sometimes without any apparent
reason for it the russian saw tears
in her eyes his visits became less
frequent

  he had changed too his ges-
tures were less lively he trod the
streets with bowed shoulders and
uncertain steps and when he lifted
his face his appearance surprised
those who had known him

  with indifference he had contem-
plated the spectacle of the socialists
at first beaten coming into power
and persecuting their enemies in
turn men he had venerated broke
their most solemn promises forgot
all friendships and honor and went
through the old familiar gestures of
those they had been crying out
against among all parties self-in-
terest envy and cowardice appeared

without a single redeeming virtue

  but selevine had lost his faculty
of being indignant over such things
a profound lassitude had submerged
his qualities of hate and love the
generous ideals for which he had
been willing to sacrifice his life in
the past so full of hopes and strug-
gles had now become a melancholy
vision without warmth his only
comfort was that he felt able to see
the truth without any haze of illu-
sion and his misanthropy had ac-
quired an almost metaphysical char-
acter

  one of his friends the painter
keller hoping that diversions would
draw him from this moodiness had
introduced him into a cosmopolitan
artistic circle the correct bohe-
mians of this group always washed
and shaved made desperate efforts
to bring originality into their lives
but their dilettantism had a charac-
ter that was hardly innocent they
had a definite bent toward the more
morose forms of vice

  morphine and cocaine were freely
used to overcome the pains caused
by the radioactive metals and the
use of these drugs had spread with
great rapidity overcome by his in-
curable boredom his will-power de-
funct selevine had been unable to
resist the example already the in-
fluence of the drugs was showing
in him he became irritable without
reason slept little he who had al-
ways preferred solitude was now
pleased only by the company of vul-
gar crowds seeking out by prefer-
ence the company of those who made
up the night-life of the dying city-
bored men and public women

a world without iron

the murmur of the crowd did not
reach the ears of mme renee
morain who had become a hermit
the death of iron



in her own room stretched out on a
chaise-longue in the position which
gave the least pain to her unhappy
body in the last two months there
had been a rapid advance in the
siderosis which was striking her
down

  the strength of the young woman
had declined a feeling of cold that
kept her huddled before a fire grew
upon her daily and her sleep was
troubled with nightmares in this
overpopulated undernourished city
now suffering from an influenza epi-
demic as well the most ordinary
medicine had begun to be scarce
mme lafont sacrificed the last of her
resources and called in the best doc-
tors she could find they gave the
sick woman one of those prepara-
tions of colloidal iron a rust-colored
drug which in a manner still ill-ex-
plained produced a notable improve-
ment after a short period of fever
the somnolence and pain of the pa-
tient became less marked

  sevcial weeks passed without any
change in her condition with the
return of her strength renee once
more had energy enough to be wor-
ried about the cares of existence
she had come to think of selevine
without resentment and had even
begun to excuse his conduct to her-
self she was genuinely glad to see
him again although she did not let
it appear on the surface of their con-
versation

  thus the conversation lacked
point the russian hardly dared
broach the subject he had at heart
she told him about the emigrants
she had seen passing in the street
bound for the new atlantis they
were singing and in their hand carts
they carried all their belongings and
their children renee had envied
these women who would certainly
experience some miseries but would
also live a free life and in an atmos-
phere of love selevine realized she
was thinking of leclair

  i wish i could get away too

she said far away from these sad
spectacles to a country where civi-
lization is not yet spoiled alas it is
impossible

  she became absorbed in some re-
flection

i often ask myself what the fu-
ture can hold for two single women
like us with unpaid bills piling up
what about me dont you count
me as your friend

  what can you do my poor sele-
vine

  quite a bit if you will merely ac-
cept my presence he hesitated a
moment embarrassed give me only
a little of your confidence  i have
ideas i want to get you out of your
troubles

  the young woman did not answer
but her contemptuous look halted on
his blemished face and then ran
down to the hands which clumsily
stopped their movements

  he was conscious of a sudden ac-
cess of despair

  renee give me a chance dont
abandon me

you have abandoned yourself
if i could somehow explain-
i am not asking for your secrets
these dry replies put him out of
countenance

  better give it up than try to de-
ceive myself he said in a muffled
voice but inaction i have-after
all im only hurting myself other
words mounted to his lips but he
did nothing but babble he was re-
lieved by the sudden entry of mme
lafont and he bade that old lady
good-bye so brusquely that she was
left with mouth wide open but re-
nee retained him for an instant and
with unexpected cordiality begged
him to come again

   in the street he recalled the pretty
smile which had illumined her face

  it was april and a precocious
spring had surprised the people of
paris in a few days the trees of the
avenues were covered with flowers
and the sky washed by rains ex-
so

tended above the city in a blue vault
against which floated a silvery fleece
odorous breezes warm sunlight
came to caress foreheads lined with
care and eyes burning with fever

  and selevine thought

  nature seems to say to her
spoiled and unhappy child why
this despair and agitation some of
your toys have been broken but you
still have all the truly good things
the forests the light the tinkling
water all the magnificent and di-
verse gifts of the holy earth 

but men were deaf to this elo-
quent voice they rn through
the streets overwhelmed with sor-
rows and regrets they gathered tfie
last of their strength to tear at each
other still submissive to the magic
of signs which had long since lost
all meaning

  the quarter where the engineer
lived was generally peaceful in the
past it had been an aristocratic resi-
dential neighborhood but now al-
most entirely deserted it showed
closed doors along the borders of its
parks and beneath the spring
branches luxurious limousineg no
longer coursed along its avenues
but one occasionally heard the
marching feet of a regiment of
blacks and the beat of their drums
groups of mounted police sometimes
went by on bronze-shod horses driv-
ing before them crowds of tramps

  selevine walked through the gar-
den-bordered streets and prome-
naded in the parks where whole
groves of trees had been cut down
among the stumps rose masses of
rocks and the ugly forms of the con-
centration camps for contagious dis-
eases as the blue evil gained the
mastery the steady noise that was
the breathing of the great city
seemed to become thin and irregu-
lar only the occasional crack of a
gun answered by the barking of
dogs served to break the silence

  in certain parts of the city the

storekeepers had branched out in
new directions the rarity of money
obliged them to adopt the primitive
mode of direct barter as a medium
of exchange utensils in neo-fibrite
porcelain stoves cooking vessels of
refractory materials were much
prized a package of steel needles
guaranteed immune to the siderosis
was an object beyond price one
day selevine saw an illustrative oc-
currence near where he lived an
old woman who had traded a pair of
curtains for one single precious
needle was weepingly exhibiting the
little piece of steel broken in twro
how would she be able to make her
living now the store-keeper a lev-
antine of sorts shrugged his shoul-
ders

  pfut i guaranteed against the
siderosis but not against acci-
dents

  someone who was examining a
tray of mineral objects looked up
and came over it was a man named
wronsky bareheaded wearing a
belt of wooden plaques and a stone
bracelet according to the prevailing
fashion

  selevine im glad to see you
hein what do you think of this
for a sign of our times the poor
woman doesnt knowt that she can
buy glass needles that are practically
unbreakable they make them at
dresden according to a secret pro-
cess

  admire this little toy i just
picked up will you its a blade of
green obsidian sharp as a razor
with a horn handle norwegian
product with it i could cut your
throat or stab you to the heart as
neat as you please our ancestors
the lake-dwellers couldnt have made
a better one it is one of the benefits
of the siderosis that it is making us
substitute the infinitely varied grains
and warm colorings of stone for the
uniformly polished surfaces of the
metals

  no more quantity-made parts
the death of iron



the careful craftsman will replace
the repetitious machine that the
modem workman has become this
age of ours is the beginning of an
artistic renovation

  most of the conceptions are still
clumsy and paralyzed by centuries
of custom but some are rich with
the promise of the future if you will
come over to my rooms ill show
you a collection of daggers scrapers
and punches in flint and fossil ivory
i also have some horn bracelets and
stones that have been engraved in
the sober and noble style that marks
the true artist i adore such things
in a more practical direction there
has been appreciable progress also
i have a whole series of utensils in
neo-fibrite and vitrified asbestos that
are something for their manufac-
turers to be proud of my mistress
who can cook like an angel is de-
lighted with them but one thing is
lacking and its annoying

  he passed his hand across his
face

  bah we have to wear beards
its the fashion but-

  selevine could not keep from smil-
ing

  you think im absurd wron-
sky said i attach a certain impor-
tance to such little details but just
the same i find this little business
of the broken needle has its impor-
tance the importance is this that
it is not here where they are selling
the old things that we will find in-
teresting observations but out at
vanves where there is a permanent
fair for the new type of products
you will find all the ersatz of iron
there specimens of all the non-me-
tallic arts and crafts ill introduce
you to silber the physiological me-
chanic he ought to be in now

  taking selevine by the arm he
led him toward the river the bridge
at issy was not entirely destroyed
but it was unsafe and they had to
take a raft-like ferry a ferryman
guided the raft by a line of cords

 stretched across the stream another
 pushed away floating masses of
 wood with his pikepole number-
 less tiny clouds were floating in the
 sky

   submitting to the influence of
 his melancholy selevine permitted
 his glance to follow down the muddy
 line of the river till it joined the
 horizon the scene had the cold in-
 human light of the countries of
 snow he had difficulty in recogniz-
 ing moulineaux the trees had been
 cut down the houses that threat-
 ened to fall had been demolished and
 he could see as far as meudon where
 the fogs were already gathering a
 crowd of sellers buyers and wan-
 derers was pressing along the espla-
 nade

   he was deafened by the barking
 as he approached one whole side
 of the market was occupied by ken-
 nels the insecurity of the individ-
 ual in the face of the growing num-
 ber of marauders the breakdown of
 all means of defense had caused an
 energetic search for breeds of dogs
 capable of being trained for defense
 among some families dog-meat also
 appeared on the bill of fare and
 little dogcarts had become a favor-
 ite method of transportation the
 most favored breeds came from bel-
 gium young men bearded and with
 long hair and young women clothed
 strangely but elegantly in berets
 leather blouses held together by
 laces and seamless moccasins went
 by in pairs cudgel in hand and hold-
 ing semi-savage hounds in leash
 others were drawn by great danes
 harnessed to little carts

   rickshaws drawn by runners in
 the japanese style were still rare
 enough to attract attention

   the crowd was most dense on the
 north side there were exhibited all
 the products which were replacing
 metal-most of them imported from
 germany pressed paper fibrite fl-
 bro-cement hard woods which had
 been impregnated or petrified by


wonder story annual

 various processes silicates lac-
 quers asbestos all varieties of glass
 various alloys immune to attack me-
 tallic dusts which had been com-
 bined under pressure and finally the
 latest invention of all-the agglom-
 erates which were colloids of iron
 and stone produced in an atmos-
 phere of argon and treated with
 waves of infra-sound

   in the hall devoted to tools one
 could find files in calorized glass re-
 sistant to any amount of filing but
 falling into fine powder if their
 points were broken knives in jade
 hatchets formed of hard lava diaph-
 onous minerals irised crystals and
 fashionable slave collars

   workmen specializing in stones
 were already numerous there were
 primary workers who detached the
 nuclei from the rocks breakers who
 split off pieces with cutting edges
 with a single well-placed blow
 grinders cutters who used bows and
 water in the manner pictured in
 egyptian tombs chiselers engrav-
 ers and workmen who had already
 become expert at sharpening hooks
 and piercing the eyeholes of needles
 in stone or horn

   seated on the ground an old man
 patiently polished a piece of flint
 all these stone objects wrere much
 favored not because of any neces-
 sity for the stocks of metals were
 still far from being exhausted but
 because everybody wanted some-
 thing new and novel it was the fash-
 ion for women to sell their gold
 mounted jewels in exchange for
 those fashioned a la sauvage

   selevine looked over these things
 with a distracted air but it was the
 exhibit in a shoe window wiiich
 really drew his attention here a
 group of inventors anticipating the
 disappearance of metal had banded
 together to exhibit models of various

	necessary appliances sextants and
 astrolabes intended to replace com-
 passes sundials siderometers for
 searching out the invisible traces of

the malady in masses of steel

xix
a dying world

there also one saw singular
clocks without gears wheels or
bearings and water-clocks in the
greek fashion vied with hour-glass-
es of all forms and sizes there was
even a giant hour-glass for the
measurement of sidereal time-the
time by which the dislocation of con-
tinents and the alterations in the
stars are measured-and smaller
ones for the measurement of the tiny
spaces of human time including an
ingenious device for the pocket pro-
vided with an automatic mechanism
for reversing the glass

  selevine thought that the coinci-
dence of two needles on a dial had
become a familiar image which hu-
manity would be some time in learn-
ing to do without the conception of
a closed cycle of time is inherent in
the human mentality at bottom is it
not a summation of all mans knowl-
edge and indeed of his conception
of the universe yes he re-
marked aloud time is an old ser-
pent who holds his tail in his
mouth

  speaking of snakes offered
wronsky i saw something quite
curious here the other day imagine
a needle with an interior tube which
connects with a reservoir of venom
it is inoffensive in appearance but
more deadly than the jaws of the
cobra you speak of disarmament
through the loss of iron go look at
the war booths-there are enough
things to make any gentleman desir-
ous of doing away with his neigh-
bor hesitate for some time maces
clubs tomahawks cutlasses lances
slings arbalests and boomerangs
are offered for your choice and
the death of iron



these names suggest the outlines of
primitive instruments but that
really means nothing the inventors
of the new ones have merely been in-
spired by certain ideas

  there my dear fellow you will
find instruments due to the collabo-
ration of the amazonian savages
who hunt for and preserve human
heads and the best engineers of the
polytechnic institute cruel little
things which do their duty exactly
coolly and intelligently and are
agreeable to have around the house
arrows can be carried in a cane for
instance a needle-dager in a ciga-
rette-holder poisoned needles in a
glove so arranged that you can kill
a friend in the simplest fashion
while shaking hands with him they
are selling slings that ladies can
carry in their handbags and blow-
pipes with half a dozen poisoned
darts in the form of fountain pens
i wont bother to remind you about
the lovely asphyxiating gases the
incendiary grenades the corrosive
liquids and disease germs vou can
buy the pacifists rejoiced too soon
over the destruction of iron

  a tiger with his claws trimmed is
none the less a tiger and man is not
ready to renounce his classical coat
of arms-that is spots of blood on
a christ crucified ah no means of
destruction are not and will not be
lacking and the military men still
have a good many bright days be-
fore them at least that is the opin-
ion of general fremont you saw
that he has demanded big credits
for the army from the chamber re-
cently a surgical instrument will
do its duty even if it is not made of
steel

  in fact war is the only remedy
capable of saving the bourgeoisie
now a sacrifice of several million
men is necessary jfor the recovery
of europe the worker without wrork
must disappear and battle offers a
form of death whose pleasures have
never been doubted in the best cir-

cles and the germans are agitating
for the same thing on their side of
the frontier the newspapers have
been arousing the popular feelings
most easy to arouse and on the
whole it will not be difficult to drum
up some reason for a conflict

  the people will refuse to march
affirmed selevine

  not at all they will step out to
get themselves killed with delight
while appeals to the brotherhood of
man have encountered nothing but
indifference and annoyance the col-
lective crime of war is always capa-
ble of rousing these great exalta-
tions of the soul to the point of self-
sacrifice of which the poets sing
selevine was unable to restrain a
gesture of annoyance

  wronsky laughed

  good i see the prospect annoys
you well lets talk about something
else the peaceful productions of the
golden age following the age of iron
for example lets go see silber and
his squirrel-cage motors and intelli-
gent dogs after all who knows
perhaps im wrong and he will have
the last word after all

they walked on for a while ar-
riving before a door which the
pole pushed in without ceremony
selevine saw a man of uncertain age
bald with a broken nose and un-
combed beard clothed in a sort of
shawl made of fur he seemed in-
timidated by the presence of his two
visitors but wronsky put him at his
ease by talking about his inventions

  machines without metal for bor-
ing polishing threshing grain
weaving all utilizing animal ener-
gy he explained in painful french
his dirty nails ran over the wheels
of fibrite the wooden connecting
rods the bearings in greased stone
showing them the faults of the early
models he had there in his workshop
he excused himself for not being
able to demonstrate his latest and
most interesting creations aided by


wonder story annual

his wife and his son-a child of fif-
teen gentlemen but always the first
in his classes-he had constructed
machines whose power was fur-
nished by a kind of pocket menag-
erie

  at present he was measuring the
strength production of energy and
fatigue point of a dog in a rotating
drum his face exhibited a mixture
of ingenuity misogyny and charla-
tanism as selevine understood
russian the conversation was car-
ried on in that tongue and accord-
ing to the habit of the sons of abra-
ham the inventor generalized

  the suppression of metal is ob-
liging us to make increasing use of
muscular contractions and the bru-
tal energies developed demand re-
sistant organs

  but the output of energy from
animals is very small protested
selevine

  evidently man needs to reduce
his pretentions that is all we shall
move about more slowly and carry
less heavy burdens a simple change
of scale in a century the new hab-
its will be formed and no one will
think them anything but normal

  and you are studying the prop-
erties of muscle

  more correctly the methods of
utilizing it in such a way as to pro-
duce the maximum effect with the
minimum output of energy organic
movements are complex varying
with the weather and other condi-
tions our machines generally
speaking envisage rotation in a con-
tinuous cycle now the intermediate
stage between these two types of ac-
tion must be established up to the
present nothing useful has been ac-
complished in this direction except
for the bicycle look what men can
accomplish with this simple ma-
chine having no other resources
than his own strength then you
will understand what enormous
fields of action lie before motorized
muscle

  then with a smile that somehow
made him look oddly younger he
told of his great hope the dream of
his existence-the invention of an
avicycle an airplane without a mo-
tor

  what did i tell you said wron-
sky as the inventor stepped out of
the room for a moment hes full
of ideas that chap too bad hes
such an unsociable creature

  night had fallen trembling flares
illuminated the scene around them
a group of visitors arrived all ac-
quaintances of wronskys very
young for the most part students or
sportsmen of the days gone by they
now made their livings by various
expedients trafficking in different
articles they were not at all inter-
ested in women or politics but dis-
cussed business and sport with the
same passionate interest they would
have devoted to automobiles a few
years before

  seeing that wronsky was sur-
rounded selevine seized the occasion
to escape

the crowd bored him he felt him-
self an utter stranger to this
younger generation and its occupa-
tions the idea that the world even
damaged as it was was going to turn
in a direction he had never imagined
was somehow painful to him he did
not like to think of the new aspect
of things and preferred to ruminate
various projects of despair was not
the future dead for him in every
sense

  he wandered about for some time
and ultimately exhausted with fa-
tigue lay down on a bench by the
river-bank the air was filled with
the scent of rotting things a boat
went by avoiding the ruins of a
bridge the shadows covered the
city inert after its rude labors of the
day he had the illusion of being the
only person awake a sentinel watch-
ing over a sleeping world a star
came out in the sky with an asso-
the death of iron



ciation of ideas he thought of the
blue evil and his eyes rested on the
ruined bridge in the shadow the
girders seemed covered with a silver
leprosy and about the ruins which
still retained the essential lines of
the structure there was something
ferocious and convulsive one seemed
to be looking at the liberating effort
of metal upon itself seeking to break
the bonds of form imposed upon it to
return to the primitive state from
which it had issued

  an approaching passerby broke
the thread of the russians thoughts
the sense of his own misery of his
irremediable isolation swept over
him he envied the sleep of the ani-
mals who are untormented by
thoughts he evoked confused pic-
tures from the abysses of his mem-
ory and then his thoughts return-
ing to renee he was oppressed by
the presentiment the certainty of
her approaching death he repre-
sented her in his minds eye in vari-
ous attitudes of torment and plea-
sure then struck down by the ma-
lady controlled by the spasms to
which it gave birth-and a terrible
peace seized upon his heart

  leaving his residence several days
later selevine ran into a line of
troops every street every bridge-
head was held in force for the news
of the toulon mutinies had just come
in and the communists were active
in all the laboring-class suburbs
sailors had deserted the battleships
and soldiers had fired on their offi-
cers the principal movers in the
revolt had been executed at paris
after summary courts-martial
whether through feebleness or ma-
lice the government had turned the
bodies over to the families of the
executed men

  after this the government rein-
forced its measures of coercion no-
body could carry on the most ordi-
nary business of life without a card
of identity actions against foreign-
ers were begun the laborers brought

from austria and poland being the
chief sufferers difficulties of trans-
port had prevented the repatriation
of these miserable people on the
evacuation of the north they lived
in camps in surroundings of incred-
ible beastliness living on garbage
devoured by vermin to the horror of
the nearby inhabitants arid the des-
pair of the sanitary authorities
they were ultimately pushed pell-
mell to the frontiers by the troops
and there at last they received per-
mission to die

  the communists became the ob-
ject of the strictest surveillance po-
lice spies were everywhere people
lived in continual fear of an anony-
mous denunciation

 toward the month of october
there was a change in conditions
the government began distributing
provisions but this measure which
was begun with the best of inten-
tions had the worst of results for
its only effect was the ruin of the
small shopkeepers at the same time
the difficulties of all forms of trans-
port became acute the reconstruc-
tion trust went bankrupt and the
possibility of a franco-german war
began to be discussed at this date
the exodus from the cities began a
sure instinct urged men to fly from
the constricted spaces where inter-
est and not brotherly love had
caused them to gather

infinite wisdom knows how to
place in the heart of the unbe-
liever the instruments for his own
punishment selevine felt keenly the
pangs of a disease he had never be-
fore experienced the agency of ap-
proaching extinction of death nude
and without disguises he had at-
tained by the route of logic and
doubt the abyss foreseen by those
who bore the intellectual torches in
advance

  he found a harsh satisfaction in
observing the vanity of all effort the
incoherence of life when it is aggra-

vated by hypocrisy and hatred

  the presence of renee alone could
give him relief from his thoughts
when he was with her everything
was peace tranquility and silence
stretched out at her full length her
figure still preserving the lines of her
youth she seemed to sleep overcome
by successive waves of pain her
eyelids were half-shut the nails of
her thin fingers gleamed among the
shadows like the jewels she wore
mme lafont sat near shrivelled in
her shawl with bright eyes in a face
of wax

  an involuntary movement on the
part of the sick woman exposed a
ravaged shoulder beneath which the
too-tired heart slept and the fever of
her worst days burned again suf-
fering and passion inspire the same
attitudes in women selevine imag-
ined himself lying at her side re-
gaining the purity of his youth by
the mere contact with the white gar-
ments she wore 

  his financial resources had dimin-
ished and he was tortured by hunger
as well as by the deprivation of his
favorite drugs at one period he at-
tempted to find work as he had ex-
pected his efforts were futile being
without a government connection he
could find nothing but the most de-
grading tasks he even haunted the
forges where men were hired to han-
dle the scraps of diseased steel but
his appearance brought him nothing
but a series of rebuffs too weak now
to think of leaving france he aban-
doned himself to his inevitable fate

  the month of december drew to
its close a sharp cold spell followed
snow-squalls long lines of the poor
formed in front of every place where
there was room for them to sleep
markets were pillaged storekeepers
murdered each in their turn the
government the middlemen and the
unemployed were blamed for condi-
tions foreigners jews and vaga-
bonds were persecuted in the com-
mon misery all pity was banished

  one evening a s t r e e t-g a m i n
brought a message to selevine from
mme lafont renees illness had
taken a turn for the worse and in her
distress the poor old woman did not
know where to look for help the
doctor selevine summoned shook his
head over her as she was suffering
he gave her an injection of mor-
phine and she passed insensibly
from the temporary sleep it afforded
to the permanent sleep of death

        epilogue
        a new world

separated by racial prejudices
but victims of the same necessi-
ties modern nations are economical-
ly interdependent all social prog-
ress all evolution damages the com-
mon interest when it attains beyond
the common level as among indi-
viduals an overwhelming superiority
of genius or fortune is intolerable
the statistical curves and their ten-
dency are the same for all countries
-they converge in the direction of
a straight line and the future and
the unforeseen are perishing from
an earth embellished by the progress
of mathematics the generations of
the future having disposed of the
uncomfortable burden of intelligence
will be able to attain the happiness
of a mechanical society which has
been definitely regulated

  but the blue evil by destroying
industry compromised this beautiful
vision of the future a few years
were sufficient to hurl down the
whole edifice of progress a piece
of composite construction whose
ruins went to join those of the an-
cient ages the equilibrium which
menaced the mind of the race with
sterility gave place to something un-
stable and heterogeneous the only
thing capable of drawing new crea-
the death of iron	

 tions of the mind out of the crisis

   peoples no longer communicated
with one another and evolved in dif-
ferent directions the unity so elab-
orately constructed was shattered
for this reason the history of the
post-metal age is in many respects
like that of the pre-metal ages

  amid the immediate confusion
certain tendencies were felt at once

   nations carried to their logical
conclusions the measures which had
disarmed the weak and the perfected
inequality of the modern social struc-
ture attained the grandeur of a state
religion for whose principles there
were even martyrs and monks oth-
ers on the contrary wished to re-
dress natural deformities in a thor-
ough-going manner and sacrifice the
individual to the mass a procedure
which caused all to partake of the
same miseries without sharing in the
same joys others still wished a
liberty without any bounds and the
dispersion of crowds

   the peoples of india and china
went rapidly toward complete an-
archy collectivism triumphed in
germany and england but with dif-
ferent characteristics america and
japan as yet little touched by the
siderosis gorged themselves with
the spoils of europe at the risk of
being stifled under their own acqui-
sitions as for france the country
of order and good sense the pre-
ferred home of the wealthy of all
nations it amalgamated the tradi-
tions of various political systems ac-
cording to the national genius

   torn by civil conflicts without
arms and without warships her in-
dustry ruined staggering under the
burden of enormous debts she still
had a certain influence in the world
the gold which hadfled from her
banks took refuge in old socks and
teapots and from this invisible pru-
dence there radiated an influence
which warmed chilled hearts

   an attempt was made to recuper-
ate certain metals by sterilizing them

with fire then storing them in silos
protected by lead sheeting but the
flowers of the evil attacked them
before they had become cold the
waves penetrated the interior of the
ground rotting the minerals and all
the other treasures of the depths

  by way of the submarine cables
the blue evil crosses the oceans
with its factories of reinforced con-
crete its ports filled with ships its
street congested with vehicles its
multiple workshops machines and
bridges america in turn felt the
victorious march of the plague

  the shortage of manufactured
products engendered bitter economic
rivalries england and the united
states disputed acrimoniously for
the precious metals coal and wood
the germans inundated the world
with special alloys whose use pro-
voked grave disasters it was then
that the patriotic campaigns begun
by certain newspapers on the occa-
sion of a tariff conflict produced their
result in a new world war the or-
der for mobilization was voted in
france by a narrow majority of pol-
iticians anxious to give the people an
outlet for their fury the concen-
tration of the army was effected in
indescribable disorder the soldiers
were undernourished discontented
and exhausted by the first forced
marches they had to make

  acts of indiscipline were quickly
followed by murders of officers en-
tire regiments mutinied and passed
from mutiny to rebellion masters of
three frontier cities the insurgents
began a march on paris the gov-
ernment confided the defense of the
capital to general felder and the
assailants were repulsed

   the cruel fantasies of this dictator
started bloody factional conflicts
which ended by plunging the whole
country into famine and civil war
he was assassinated and two chiefs
of the popular party came into pow-
er their first victims were their
own comrades and the passions they

released were long in dying down
the central council promised to
bring back order work for all and
supplies of food the unemployed
were forcibly enlisted in a labor
army great works of public utility
including the foundations of the new
ironless city were begun

  little by little the reign of factions
gained complete control all france
broke up into tiny morsels the
primitive forms of administration
necessitated by the growing paraly-
sis of all means of communication
and exchange came to the fore the
tendency toward agglomeration
which had characterized the indus-
trial age was thrown into reverse by
the operation of the blue evil

  but this tendency did not dissolve
the difficulties of the situation if
some districts enjoyed a relative
amount of security it was only be-
cause they submitted to the tyranny
of local councils the whole people
longed for deliverance but such was
the general lassitude that the labor
dictators were able to retain their
power for three years

no ship any longer plowed the
deserted seas only a few fish-
ing barks made of planks held to-
gether with wooden pegs ran along
the coasts the radio stations were
long since gone and the electric
cables the last nerve-fibers uniting
the vital centers broke down one
after another the plowshare and
the axe rusted away the needle
broke in the hand of the seamstress
the instrument the machines all
the antennae which completed and
prolonged the human senses were
irredeemably lost or broken

  men learned once more the lesson
that the body is fragile they adapt-
ed themselves to circumstances but
now they were no more than rather
inefficient animals in the wild for-
ests of the world the complexity of
modern existence the interrelation
of every fact and their influence on

every domain of life precluded any
possibility of the reconstruction of
civilization specialization and the in-
terdependence of organisms-those
master-products of modern society
-brought about the fall of the en-
tire structure through the failure of
one of its parts

  the great cities monstrous tu-
mors of materiality concretions of
stone and steel on a sterile soil were
the least spared

  stocks of cereals and combustibles
were quickly exhausted camping in
tunnels and cellars everywhere the
poor emerged to pillage the ruined
houses and tear up wooden side-
walks like derelicts carried along
by some invisible current homeless
men wandered through the streets

  all efforts in the direction of im-
provement broke down on the lack
of agricultural instruments when
winter came the aged the weak and
those without resources perished
the skeleton corpses of peasants
were found stretched out in the fal-
low fields their mouths filled with
the earth that had failed to support
them the workless who had left the
cities came flooding back demanding
food

  paris saw villagers arriving pull-
ing their handcarts or carrying skin-
ny children wanderers clothed in
rags their feet torn acorbutics who
could be flattened by a breath

  corpse robbers were recognizable
by their furtive air and their ap-
pearance of hunted animals those
who had been captured by the pea-
sants were nailed alive to trees

  for the first time in four cen-
turies wolves in great numbers ap-
peared in france they came from
the ardennes the black forest and
still more distant haunts following
the track of the great famine their
indefatigable hordes converged in a
single direction-the south toward
which they were drawn by some in-
explicable instinct high in the heav-
ens soared birds of prey
the death of iron



   over the frontiers also surged a
horde of famished creatures with
limbs more rigid than dead wood and
bodies devoured by ulcers and ver-
min they came from austria where
a whole people was perishing amid
terrible contortions from the polish
ghettoes from sanitary camps
those centers of hate and despair
and they marched on without pay-
ing any attention to the bodies with
which they sowed the roads in spite
of hunger and cold in spite of the
ferocious animals and still more piti-
less men nothing could halt this
current of life which did not wish to
die

  by instinct they moved toward the
cities where there were still stores of
provisions paris was the center of
this movement works of defense
were hastily thrown up guards
watched at the gates of the city
while these specters whom walls
could not halt marched on to sur-
round them

  already germs brought in by the
immigrants had engendered epidem-
ics of strange diseases among the
ruins and rotting corpses of men and
animals rats roamed about carrying
bacilli water escaped from the con-
duits and terrible fires devoured
whole cities without being checked
not a day went by without some new
crime or horror coming to shatter
the nerves or arouse sleeping feroci-
ties

  all constraints-law morals and
wisdom-were removed and as the
common people slipped into mere
beastliness their masters showed the
disquieting visages of maniacs and
scoundrels unmasked and un-
ashamed it seemed that the blue
malady was sapping not only the
physical vitality of organisms but
consciences as well

  there were brawls everywhere
men fought and killed not only for
necessity or to gain booty but out of
a mere taste for killing the weak
gathered around those who had

strong muscles and intrepid charac-
ters with the coming of night
everybody barricaded himself in his
house while a multitude of vaga-
bonds raced through the streets com-
mitting the worst excesses and
laughing at the police forces

  certain of them acquired a sinister
renown and accomplished deeds that
seemed like those of some savage
delirium

  nobody knew the number of these
night-raiders or where they lived
with the close of day they issued
suddenly from their unknown haunts
to murder and violate

in the middle of the night there
would be cries the sounds of bat-
tle the galloping of a horse a flame
would burst out somewhere hurling
back the intense shadows the mili-
tia running to the spot stared stu-
pidly at the flaming houses the
rooms with their doors broken open
the corpses of children among the
bloody ruins women disappeared to
be found later in abandoned fields or
waterways their bodies mangled

  several of these chauffeurs the
old name still hung about themj
were caught and executed without
quieting public opinion these events
increased in number at last in a
great drive some hundred of the
bandits were seized at once they
were discovered to be not people of
the lowest classes but the elite of
society by day they moved about
the streets quietly and soberly no
marks of insanity appeared on the
faces behind which such horrible
plans had been formed

  those who judged them were as-
tonished at the serenity with which
their victims heard the sentences
which condemned them to death no-
body was capable of understanding
these artists in death who had
wished to draw unforgettable aes-
thetic pleasures from the sufferings
of others they were children of an
age which had rejected the absolute
	wonder story annual

and scorned the ideal and they had
sought these infinite needs of man in
impossible horrors

  the executions were numerous to
the great pleasure of the lower class-
es they seized the miserable bodies
from their guardians and tore them
to pieces grimacing faces watched
the process avidly and those who
could not take part in these delicious
public murders watched them with
eagerness the executions roused
wild and savage cries of excitement
in the mob which overwhelmed by
the pleasure of the moment spread
through the city for battle and pil-
lage it was with difficulty that
horsemen broke them into little
groups and beat them with clubs

  finding the operations of justice
too slow for their taste the citizens
demanded a pitiless suppression of
such movements and sought to bring
it about by extra-legal means se-
cret societies anarchists affiliated
with the ravagers embarked on ob-
scure machinations sowing the
germs of contagious diseases in va-
rious places poisoning rivers set-
ting fire to private and public build-
ings sinister tales passed from
mouth to mouth and aggravated the
universal suspicion and fear to get
rid of your enemy you accused him
of murder a chance resemblance a
sign wrongly interpreted would
cause the crowd to hurl itself on
some inoffensive stranger

  man hunts were organized with
enthusiasm every telegraph pole
and tree bore its fruit of hanged
men at the corner of the street one
found a corpse with a shoelace tight-
ened around its throat its limbs
broken its throat cut or emptying
its brains into the gutter

  but all other dangers and terrors
were quickly forgotten in the arrival
of an epidemic

  a contagious influenza which had
its origins in the asiatic lands and
among the peoples of galicia trav-
ersed austria ravaged germany and

at the moment of its greatest vio-
lence reached france in the labor-
ing class sections the poor debili-
tated by undernourishment were
soon dying by scores the frightful
days of the pestilences of the middle
ages returned the fever produced
by the disease was high theexhaus-
tion following was profound

  the sick person died in one night
delirious those who resisted the
disease were soon carried off by the
complications which the enfeebled
organism was unable to beat off in
some particularly severe cases even
the medicines were turned to poison
by the effect of the germs worn
down as it was the entire country
submitted to the attack of the de-
structive forces without being cap-
able of an effort of recovery like
some great body plunged in a coma
the hospitals were gorged with the
sick and all medical stores were ex-
hausted without interruption the
funeral processions passed through
the streets

  the excess of misery and the fear
of the contagion provoked cases of
dementia and collective suicides
every day the seine threw up on its
banks green and swollen bodies
when the warm days came a poison-
ous slime appeared at the bottoms
of cisterns and pestilential odors
filled the city

  the shadow of the plague stretched
over all france stifling the last
sounds of effort in wails of despair
in the deserted streets only a few
masked hospital attendants were to
be seen carrying bodies which were
taken to the suburbs to be burned in
great heaps the contaminated ruins
of the poor quarters were likewise
deliberately destroyed by fire for
a whole week a ruddy light never
failed to illuminate the sky on the
side of st denis where the clocks
were still striking the hours

  the vaccination centers the ambu-
lances were demolished and troops
of people fled from the city on foot
the death of iron



with hardly a rag to cover them
they dispersed along all the roads
disputing for inedible scraps of food
while the villagers locked themselves
in or brandished grim clubs beside
their growling dogs as the plague
spread the hatred of every man for
his neighbor grew apace

  sometimes a hospital convoy ap-
proached the seine the last weak-
ened bridges were blown up and all
boats fled to a distance those who
looked on the spectacle contemplated
with horror the black faces of the
dead in the tragic river

  eventually the contagion extended
over the whole world and dominated
every other thing fear exercised
its dissolving action on consciences
and from that moment the last ties
that kept down the beast in man
were broken

along the unused highways vege-
tation began to pierce the stony
soil and cover the denuded places
with a verdant tapestry the useful
plants perished fruit trees returned
to their wild state hedges became
impenetrable thickets in which birds
built their nests insects foraged
among the stones man had worked to
his will ivies and lianas moved pru-
dently over the statues taking pos-
session of places hitherto forbidden
to them while a thousand little ani-
mals seriously occupied with mur-
der nourishment love and home
ran about but in the ruined cities
green things still refused to grow

  the water of the heavens washed
the white walls of houses which had
become great sepulchres an instinc-
tive terror kept living things away
from these desolate places where
the bodies were gradually dissolving
and where the radiation from the
rotting irons produced incurable ul-
cers on the skin only a few ravens
built their nests there and a few
dogs strong and wild as wolves lit
the nights with their phosphorescent
eyes

  the elements had not yet worn
down the granite and the moss had
not yet covered the nudity of the
constructions of stone wrung from
the earth a heartrending tranquil-
ity emanated from these cities of the
people of the metals as the soft lines
gradually eovered the evidence of
their last convulsive effort

  immense skeletal structures were
still to be found there bushes of
tangled wires columns split like
trees by bolts of lightning some-
times with a crackling sound a
pylon would collapse and a dust of
rust and cinder would rise then the
silence would fall once more

  after the great epidemics all
sound men had fled from these
charnel houses dispersed through-
out the world enfeebled discour-
aged they despaired of reconquering
the metals which had made them
masters of the globe their mortal-
ity-rate was high for sporadic forms
of the contagious diseases were still
abroad the most cultured being
the least adept in the combats of
primitive existence were the first to
perish

  as though crushed by the strug-
gle man permitted nature to shower
blows about his head without at-
tempting to defend himself the ele-
ments beat upon him the unculti-
vated ground refused to nourish him
the animals seeming to understand
his fall became less timorous and
asserted their rights to existence
with energy dogs which had be-
come accustomed to attack men fol-
lowed the trails of the caravans and
silently tore out the throats of any
laggards

  returning once more to the ancient
means of defense the people of the
villages made great fires and armed
themselves with spear and hatchet
and carts whose wheels were sec-
tions of trees some emigrated to
more fertile countries guiding them-
selves by the stars after the manner
of the ancient navigators avoiding


wonder story annual

traps digging out canoes and chas-
ing wild animals others replaced
the steel plowshare by flakes of flint
and forced the unwilling soil to pro-
duce a scanty wheat in france
tribes which rapidly forgot civilized
customs grew up the river-dwellers
built huts along the banks and in
the plains men constructed towers
connected by walls strong enough to
resist the attacks of marauding
bands

  nomads driving before them their
herds of horned animals moved
about at random exchanging skins
fishhooks and vases of clay for the
crude bread the agriculturists made
of their wheat

  these degenerate descendants of
the conquering races showed definite
signs of regression and lacked the
vitality of the primitive tribes fear
and defeat had made them somber
incapable of any sustained effort
irresolute in their actions they lived
the opportunist existence of the
hopelessly misfit their fitness for
survival had declined and already
nature was considering their exter-
mination through her inexorable
processes

  the warrior instinct that source
of all the virtues through which the
youth and health of a race finds ex-
pression had been extinguished
they no longer enjoyed fighting and
if they killed it was in a manner
without peril to themselves attack-
ing animals asleep or women and
children their passions were as de-
bilitated as their bodies their ten-
dency toward indecision toward use-
less cruelty and indolence chimeri-
cal fears haunted their minds they
had forgotten how to pray but a
kind of complaint escaped them from
time to time when they were more
than usually oppressed by animal
agonies

  some of them possessed fragments
of iron which they venerated as
though it were a fetish of some kind
little by little the idea of the metal-

lic entity grew up among them as
a kind of god and the source of
splendors beyond the imagination
new religions based on superstition
and bloody sacrifices replaced the
ancient beliefs the cult of stones
was reborn their ancestors had
known that a stone of some kind
fallen from the heavens had been
the cause of their own decline but
they had almost forgotten it the
tradition survived only as a kind of
vague terror mingled with admira-
tion man was once more drinking
at the sources which had nourished
his infancy

ttumanity had lost all communi-
n ty feeling the displacement
and interchange which had agitated
individuals from their childhood to
their death which had produced new
races had disappeared no discord-
ant echoes troubled the immobility
of vegetable and stone

  in a world of diminished resources
millions of individuals had perished
the survivors followed their ways
almost on tiptoe across places where
the brilliant glare of metal burned
no longer they belonged to a less
prolific race and one with a taste for
contemplation a horror of noise and
movement an irremediable disap-
pointment veiled their eyes and they
had forgotten how to smile

  once the last combats were over
and the epidemics extinguished they
discovered the bitterness of their
own condition and regretted the past
of their race the need of doing the
thirst for creation woke once more
nothing could satiate this ache but
they searched for means other than
material ones for the new types of
expression

  the stimulating action of the
struggle for existence had ceased to
exist work and play have they not
their common origin in mans neces-
sity for escaping from his own
thoughts the new race incapable
of breaking its hereditary habits or
the death of iron



of really adapting itself to changed
conditions learned all the horrors of
reflection

 eventually the nomads made
drugs which dispensed funeral pleas-
ures and gradually deprived the
takers of strength death beautified
by poisons had a corrosive savor
which very few could resist

  some of them also perished sud-
denly without any signs of organic
decay a profound lack of energy
marked these sons of a vanished
civilization who could not enter the
road to a new type of life for them
the cycles of progress had ceased to
revolve but others who were
marked by invisible signs prepared
in curious ways a soil fit to receive
the seeds of the future

  one sect of fanatics preached the
return to a vegetable life the nega-
tion of form the denial of physical
perceptions and even of knowledge
religions rich with oriental quietism
exalted the nirvana their agents de-
stroyed the last vestiges of progress
sacked the villages that had been re-
built with so much effort the forti-
fied towns were given over to bar-
barisms and disappeared while other
places became the scenes of group
murders in moments of erotic frenzy

  men suffered from torments pre-
viously unknown and heard once
more the voice of fear that had been
drowned by the noise of the cities
aspirations unsatisfied by the spasms
of the body and the cold drugs of
religion wandered wildly the cabala
and necromancy were reborn num-
berless theosophists magi demon-
worshippers and occultists princes
of a kingdom of shadows and illu-
sions rose in all the corners of the
earth they evoked forms situated
beyond the realm of physical percep-
tion and produced incredible phe-
nomena

  who can tell how these aberra-
tions reached their ultimate result-
through slow evolution or sudden
bounds of progess but there was

ultimately an alteration in the form
of human mentality

  time rolled on destroying the last
vestiges of ancient labor generation
succeeded to generation while the
practical interests and preoccupa-
tions of the ancestors became incom-
prehensible interpretations of the
subtle forces of intelligence changed
elements never before employed
latent forces gained the mastery

  there was an extraordinary de-
velopment of intuitive perception a
drift toward a mysticism in which
both formal intelligence and the
blind instincts were destroyed a con-
traction of thought which rose out
of the mind of the race to identify
itself with life

  philosophers already saw the dawn
of a civilization which had no ele-
ment of the mechanical and the cre-
ative energy of the mind entered the
domain of the supersensitive almost
the supernatural there appeared
new modes of thought engendered
in the course of evolution to satisfy
the conditions of environment and
the exigencies of life modes of
thought altogether different from
those that had been supposed the
only ones possible

     positive science explains the
diversity of things and relates them
to known facts it discovers the re-
lation of various phenomena to one
another but never their reason for
existence it is an instrument im-
posed by the necessities of maternal
action and its use supposes the im-
perfection of the senses through its
means we can perceive only a small
portion of the world but the soul
the interior abyss which is the home
of the infinite contains things which
the intelligence can never explain
it has gathered all the experiences
progress and conquests of life but
these stored treasures are perceived
only across a veil of shadows

  and one day man will free himself
from matter to search for these
treasures

through the three quartz
windows showed darkness far
deeper than the black of inter-
stellar space it made one feel totally
alone forever removed from the
familiar things of earth

  the ships single room was small
and the three men made it crowded
the insistent hum of the engine
gave some feeling of reality but one
had to keep his eyes away from
those windows for utter emptiness
was a thing no man could stand

  dr leslie chapman was hunched
over the controls guiding the ship
on its strange flight over his
stooped shoulder peered tall dark-
haired ivar augustus

 and ivar was watching with

something more than interest ever
since the ship had left familiar space
and plunged into this mysterious
inter-dimensional continuum ivar
had kept his eyes on the controls

  behind his saturnine countenance
ivar was thinking dark thoughts
which the white-haired doctor and
his assistant could not guess he
masked his feelings well

  he knew why the white-haired
man had invited him on this trial
flight-to gloat over him to bask in
the success of his supreme invention
it would make dr leslie chapman
the greatest scientist in the world

  ivar knew he could never surpass
this machine the knowledge of his
failing prowess in science had been

thrust upon him too often there
was something that made the
thought of his failing almost un-
bearable it was a boast made long
ago when he and chapman had
been vying for top honors in the
same college he knew he could
not fulfill it

  besides dr chapmans invention
would net him well over a half mil-
lion dollars in the numerous scientific
awards it was sure to bring ivar
knew of some very good uses for
that much money

  he fondled the little smooth-
handled object in his pocket-a
little invention of his own that might
have brought him much perhaps it
would yet help bring him more any-
thing could happen in another uni-
verse 

  suddenly dr chapman cried out
weve done it supraluna pulls-

 subtle force wrenched the
ship twisting the very atoms it
was like a long fall coming to a sud-
den stop-against nothing and it
had brought them to a new universe

  ivar had seen the last of dr chap-
mans manipulations now he closed
his eyes for a moment then turned
his attention to the view in the ports
a green light appeared in one of the
windows

  it was a colossal disc of pale lumi-
nescence in a background of star-
less space-a huge bloated world of
purest jade it must have measured
all of ten degrees from edge to edge
its light was soft and soothing but
curiously mottled an interplay of
dark and glowing areas

  a planet dr chapman whis-
pered a great sunless planet

  but dave manning the doctors
young assistant pointed to the con-
trol board the indicator shows
that it has no mass no gravity

look the needles pointing in the
other direction

  they all turned and saw a disc
of light exactly like the other but
smaller

  that is a planet said dr chap-
man a little smaller than the
earth to judge from our indicators
let us approach this world
said ivar that is if your machine
can prpl itself through space

 dr chapman smiled moved a
lever a slight acceleration tugged
at them the ship was moving
through the alien void

  rockets he explained i had
an inkling we might materialize
here in the middle of space so i in-
stalled them

  their objective soon grew into
a world of appreciable proportions
it was like a huge ball splotched
with radium paint this strange sun-
less world furnished its own light
dr chapman remained at the con-
trols and the dark-haired man still
watched ivar wanted to learn every
operation of this ship he might
have to fiy it soon

  finally a grinding of metal on
rock told them the ship had landed
dr chapmans machine had brought
them to a planet more remote from
earth than the farthest galaxies

  the ship rested on a level plain
that curved away on all sides to a
nearby horizon in the heavens were
no stars no sun the great disc of
green light they had first seen was
still visible but a strange thing had
happened to it the ship had gone
in a direction away from it but its
apparent size hadnt grown smaller
with distance instead it now seemed
many times its former size covering
nearly all the sky with its pale light

  ivar was the first to notice the
phenomenon look he said ges-
turing what kind of a universe is
	wonder story annual

this your machine has brought us
to dr chapman and his assistant
were gazing upward puzzlement
showing on their faces

  like a mammoth lid the light
hung over the world spreading to
within a few degrees of the horizon
there it faded away leaving a nar-
row band of space to meet the eye

  i think im beginning to under-
stand said dr chapman ive
told you the theory on which i based
my ship-the idea that there are
many three-dimensional universes
having movements and orbits of
their own in a four-dimensional
space-just like a planetary system

  they are simply planets or
spheres of curved space our own
universe is a huge three-dimensional
space-world it has its satellites
smaller universes circling it

  what we have done is to travel
to one of these satellites-this one
i call it supraluna but that light
in the sky is explained by the fact
that this is a smaller universe its
curve is finite here is near at hand
that patch of light in the sky is this
same planet on which we stand and
which we see around the universe

  when we neared the planet we
decreased the number of possible
lines of vision that did not intersect
with this world therefore the image
grew in apparent size probably this
is the only world in the entire cos-
mos for there is room for no other
ivar who had been listening to
th e theories with apparent lack
of enthusiasm interrupted the doc-
tor these are all very well in the
way of abstract explanations but
what are we to do now 

the gray-haired scientist smiled
dave unpack the space-suits he
said to his assistant who had just
tested a sample of atmosphere
dave manning obediently pulled

open a trap door at one side of the
floor and took out three bundles

  oxygen suits he explained the
air here is not very breathable

  the suits when unrolled turned
out to be one-piece affairs made of
thick fabric and topped by rigid
helmets goggles of reenforced
glass permitted vision

  in a few minutes the men were
attired ready to emerge manning
went out first through a cramped
airlock soon afterward his bulging
figure appeared in one of the ports

  ivar bowed to dr chapman aft-
er you doctor he said

wthen the doctor had climbed
   through ivar picked up the ob-
ject he had lifted from his pocket
it was a small hollow tube with a
metal handle and an enclosed mech-
anism at one end he was glad he
had brought it along-that athletic
looking assistant might prove trou-
blesome

  the terrain was hard beneath
their feet and full of little prismatic
glitters as though it were composed
of pulverized diamond but here and
there were softer places where the
ground was porus

  all around them were the lumi-
nous areas where the mineral
glowed with a vivid green radiance
at close range these could be seen
to consist of tiny threads of light
pulsing with alien living energy

  life whispered dr chapman

  the others heard him through
ether-wave units in their helmets

  what do you mean asked ivar

  life repeated the scientist
the simplicity of this universe
forbids more complex forms life
here is simply a radiation feeding
on pure matter

  this is a strange planet said
ivar slowly unbelievably removed
inhospitable what a place to die

  he felt the tide of resolution ris-
ing within him now was his chance
no one on earth knew of this trip
he ivar could go back alone and
eventually announce the dimension-
rotor as his own discovery

 dave manning had caught his
cryptic mention of death what
do you mean-die  he asked rising

  ivar was edging toward the ship
he turned the tube in his hand

  this is an act of self-preserva-
tion on my part he said coolly i
have no other alternative

  dr chapman looked up at him
his bewildered face shining through
his goggles why- he began but
ivar broke in with a laugh

  my meaning is simple enough
he said this dimension-rotor of
yours is a wonderful machine-one
which might add credit to my genius
as well as yours he waved the tube

  besides ivar went on i have
long felt that i could follow my
scientific pursuits better if dr les-
lie chapman were not around to
anticipate my discoveries do you
see this supraluna is a wonderful
place in which to disappear

 you wouldnt-

  ivars icy laugh came through the
earphones

  id advise you both not to try to
follow me to the ship this little
device in my hand projects a beam of
high-frequency radiations enough to
kill any living creature a little in-
vention of my own almost as won-
derful as yours dr chapman
slowly ivar stepped backward to-
ward the ship watching the others

  dr chapman was pale he seemed
overcome

  it was only the assistant man-
ning ivar had to fear he could see
they were afraid of the tube in his
hand and well they might be ivar



could almost read the thoughts of his
victims he could see manning pre-
paring for a leap and brought his
weapon to bear

  and when manning suddenly
lurched aside ivar grimly pulled the
trigger a thin beam of ionization
leapt from the weapons muzzle

  it sliced through the space man-
ning had occupied a split second be-
fore a continuous beam-so much
more efficient than a bullet ivar re-
flected with cool pride he started
to flick the ray across the moving
man and that was the last thing
he knew

  ivar augustus was standing there
outlined against the rim of black
space from this blackness from an
infinite distance a bright beam of
light lanced down only for a mo-
ment did it touch ivars broad back

  the weapon went dark the tall
figure swayed toppled loosely to

  war maneuvers-

harry osborn first lieu-
tenant u s army air corps
banked his wide-winged
bombing plane in an easy swooping
curve in the distance new yorks
white pinnacles caught the sun above
a blue-gray billowing of twilight
ground-haze

  a faint smile lifted the corners
of his lips as he glanced overside
saw a train crawl along shining rails
and come to a halt brown dots ap-
peared from the passenger car be-
hind its locomotive and clustered in
ordered confusion about the other

oblong that completed the trains
complement

  what appeared from his altitude
to be a rather large pocket-handker-
chief slid from the car and spread
out on the grass a metal tube
glittered in the sun came into mo-
tion swiveling to the east it looked
like a cap-pistol but osborn knew
it to be an eighteen-inch railroad
gun

  he slanted down through lambent
air the terrain below was flat
lushly green it was entirely vacant
save at the very center of its five-

hut was visible in the middle of a
hundred-yard area ringed by a
water-filled moat

  two manikins stood before the
structure one was clothed in od
the other in black the civilians tiny
arms gesticulated and he went into
the house the army man moved

were to bomb the target is-good
lord

  the plane wobbled with osborns
sudden jerk on its stick steadied
harry raynes exclaimed what
is it harry

  the targets that house down
there theres a man inside it i
saw him go in

  the hell whats the big idea
search me theres no mistake
though orders say absolute secrecy
is to be maintained by all partici-
pants in this maneuver as to any-
thing they may observe    
maybe its an execution-some-
thing special maybe-

        and this order is to be
obeyed to the letter no matter what
the apparent consequences  os-
born finished general darius
thompson signed it personally not
by direction tie that will you
i cant but-its orders os-
born leveled out got his eyes fo-
cused on the astounding target

  suddenly there was nothing with-
in the watery circle not blackness
nor a deep hole nor anything simi-
larly startling but understandable
it was as if a blind spot had sud-
denly developed in his own visual or-
gans so that he could not see what
there was at that particular point-
although the wide green expanse of
the swampy plain was elsewhere
clear and distinct

a key scraped in the door of a
third floor flat on amsterdam
avenue juniors two-year-old legs
betrayed him and he sprawled head-
long on the threadbare rug in the
little foyer

  john sims bent to his first-born
tossed him into the air caught him
and chuckled at the chubby dirt-
grimed face hed been tired as the
devil a moment before but now-
june sims was flushed from the
heat of the kitchen range but her
black hair was neat and a crisply-
ironed house dress outlined her
young slim figure junior was a

warm bundle against her breasts as
she kissed john

  youre early dear im glad
me too whats for supper
pot roast junes hazel eyes
danced johnny mother phoned
shes going to come over tomorrow
night to take care of junior so that
we can go out and celebrate your
birthday

  thats right tomorrow is may
ninth

  yes listen i have it all planned
alone with love is playing at the
audubon well see that and then
splurge with chow mein ive saved
ten dollars out of house money

  you have maybe youd better
get yourself a hat i saw an ad-
nothing doing were going to
celebrate you go downtown

  and on and on  

  theyre starting harry
raynes businesslike crispness
somewhat eased lieutenant osborns
feeling that something uncanny was
happening below and his hand was
steady as he jerked the stick to cope
with the bump of the big guns dis-
charge a dirt mushroom sprouted
in the field

  short two-tenths-right four
point three jim intoned correct-
ing the range

  a white panel on the ground ac-
knowledged his message the cannon
fired again and slid back in the oil-
checked motion of its recoil

  over a tenth-center

  the target was bracketed the next
try must be a hit harry banked
leveled out the brown dots that
were the gunners darted about fever-
ishly reloading whatever it was
that obscured his vision of the shack
would be smashed in a moment now

  the gunners were clear the pilot
saw an officers arm drop in signal
to fire yellow light flickered from
the big rifle osborn imagined he
saw the projectile are just under
his plane

  his eyes flicked to where the
house should be
the lanson screen	

  and nothing happened no geyser
of dirt to show a miss no dispersal
of that annoying blind spot had the
gun misfired

  wait what was that black thing
gliding in mid-air sliding slowly
then more rapidly toward the
ground the shell that could pierce
ten inches of armor was incredibly
falling along what seemed like the
surface of an invisible hemisphere

  it reached the grass and exploded
with the contact the earth it threw
up spattered against-nothing why
hadnt the shell exploded on contact
with whatever had stopped it what
was going on down there

  i-i cant make a report sir
there was a quiver in jims phleg-
matic voice even his aplomb had
now been pierced i think it should
have been a hit but-

  again and again the great gun
fired osborn and raynes got the
signal to go ahead dropped five
three-hundred-pound bombs point-
blank on the mysterious nothingness
the area around the circular canal
was pitted excavated scarred as no
mans land had never been

  aviation lieutenant harry os-
born flew back to mitchel field in
the gathering dusk his young head
was full of dizzy visions armies
cities a whole nation blanketed from
attack by invisibility spheres of
nothingness driving deep into enemy
territory impregnable

  it was good to be alive and in the
od uniform on this eighth day of
may

  in the tea room of the ritz-plaza
the violins of ben donnies orchestra
sobbed to the end of a melodic waltz
anita harrison-smith fingered a
tiny liqueur glass nervously

  im afraid ted what if he sus-
pects and-

  the long-fingered hand of the man
whose black eyes burned so into hers
fisted on the cloth

  afraid-that has been always
the trouble with you nita you have
always been afraid to grasp happi-

ness well i cant make you do it
but ive told you that im sick of
this hole-and-corner business if you
dont come with me tomorrow as we
planned i go alone you will never
see me again

  the womans face went white and
she gasped no i couldnt bear
that ill come ted ill come

  van nordens sharp dark features
were expressionless but there was
faint triumph in the sly purr of his
voice

  have you got it straight the
marechal foch sails at midnight to-
morrow from pier fifty-seven foot

get away from the gellert dance not
later than eleven-thirty ill meet you

        the screen

general darius thompson
stood at the side of his olive-
green cadillac and looked at his
watch the bombing plane was a
vanishing sky-speck just above the
horizon the railroad - gun had
chugged back toward its base he
was alone under the loom of that
sphere of nothingness against which
the armys most powerful weapons
had battered in sheer futility it
existed it was real unbelievably

  a man stood in the doorway of
the flimsy hut that had been the
target of the shells quarter-inch


wonder story annual

lenses made his bulging eyes huge
his high-domed head was hairless
and putty-colored his body obscenely
fat professor henry lanson gave
one the impression that he was some-
how less than human that he was a
slug uncovered beneath an over-
turned rock but his accession to
the columbia university faculty had
been front-page news and the signal
for much academic gloating

  well from gross lips the word
plopped into the warm air like a
clod into mud what do you think
now my dear general against my
screen your biggest shells were as
puffballs yes your most gigantic
bombs as thistledown you thought
me utterly insane when i insisted on
remaining within the scientist
grinned humorlessly what do you
think now

  thompson shook his grizzled head
as if to rid it of a nightmare you
took an awful chance suppose it had
cracked

  cracked in the name of planck
cannot you understand that the lan-
son screen is not matter that can
crack the other spread veined
pudgy hands it is the negation of
all energy a dimensionless shell
through which energy cannot pene-
trate and since matter is a form of
energy- the physicist checked
himself shrugged

  but whats the use i cannot ex-
pect you to understand besides my-
self there are perhaps a dozen in the
world who could comprehend and
none is an american enough for
you to know that i had to be inside
to operate the b machine that cut
the negative force the a apparatus
set up from outside it could not
be done the screen would have re-
mained forever and you would not
be convinced there had been no effect
of your bombardment within it
could you not have managed
some remote control device some
way of working your b machine
from outside

  lord but you military men are

stupid the physicist burst out ex-
asperatedly dont you understand
yet that once the lanson screen is
erected all within is as absolutely
cut off from the rest of the universe
as if it were a different space a
different dimension nothing can
penetrate within-electricity wire-
less the cosmic rays the suns radia-
tions nothing

  then if a city were covered by it
as you suggest there would be no
means of communication with the
outside

  that is correct

  if knowledge of this were univer-
sal there could be no more war
thompsons grey eyes lifted and met
the others a momentary silence
intervened while a message flashed
between these two so diverse char-
acters then the general went on
but if it were the exclusive prop-
erty of a single nation that nation
could become master of the world
lanson nodded his voice betrayed
knowledge of the rapprochement
established in that single long glance
if i published my results i should
gain very little from it but if i sell
it to one power it is worth almost
anything i choose to demand

  that is why i have worked at it
alone that is why i have never set
the details down on paper to be
stolen after i have sold the inven-
tion to you secrecy will be your con-
cern-but till you meet my terms all
knowledge of how i produce the
effect remains here in my brain
lanson tapped his clifflike brow
here and nowhere else

  after we purchase it you still
might sell your device to others
with a million dollars in hand i
shall have no temptation to do so
no one could want or use more that
is one reason why you should be
willing to recommend its payment
the general shrugged i can get
it for you when i am convinced that
you can veil an entire city as you did
this one small house it seems to me
that so tremendous a task requiring
the lanson screen



such huge installations and such
vast power would be forbiddingly
costly

rfhe physicists short grating
a laugh was contemptuous ill
shield new york for you with the
same machine i used here with the
same power-storage batteries not
larger than those in your car their
energy is needed for only an instant
to start the complex functioning of
forces whose result you have just
witnessed ill erect a screen for you
about manhattan island an ellipsoid
as high and as deep as the least axis
of the enclosing rivers will that
satisfy you 

  if you can do it and i cannot blast
through it will when can you get
ready

  as soon as i can move my ma-
chines to the required location and
set them up tomorrow night if you
wish

  very well what help do you re-
quire

  only an army truck to convey
my apparatus and since i will use
the rivers as a delimiting guide for
the screen a place near the water to
set it up

  the general was eager now eager
as the other ill order a truck out
there at once and there is an army
pier at west one hundred and thir-
tieth street that you can use ill
see that it is made ready for you

  midnight of may eighth  an
army truck noses into the holland
tunnel on its flat bed are two tar-
paulin-covered bulks machinery of
some sort its driver is crowded
against his wheel by the rotund form
or a black-clad civilian whose chins
hang in great folds on his stained
shirt and whose bulging eyes glow
behind thick lenses with a strange
excitement the truck comes out on
hudson street and turns north

  tenth avenue is alive as puffing
trains bring the citys food for to-
morrow a herd of bewildered cattle
file into an abattoir west end ave-

nues apartment houses are asleep
under the riverside viaduct a milk
plant is alight and white tank trucks
rumble under its long canopy

 at one hundred and twenty-
ninth street the army van waits for
a mile-long refrigerator train loaded
with fruit from california to clear
the tracks it must cross the way is
cleared the truck thunders across
cobbles and steel vanishes within
the dark maw of a silent pier

  two blocks eastward a lighted
subway train crawls out on its
trestle for a breath of air pauses
fleetingly dives underground again
like a monstrous serpent seeking its
burrow above the southward course
of that burrow midtown broadway
is a streak of vari-colored illumina-
tion exploding into frantic corusca-
tion and raucous clamor at forty-
seventh street

  crowds surge on sidewalks in
shrieking cabs private cars-pleas-

rushing to grills night clubs-rush-
ing home rushing as if life must end
before they can snatch enough of it

turns and checks connections on

face loom the palisades a dash of
yellow luminance zigzags against

lights are an arabesque of gold
against the overcast sky

  to the right the cables of george
washington bridge dip twin cate-

apices of moire chromatic ribbons
rippling across the water to the pier
head from the deeper shadow of an

  braced vertically five feet behind

plate this is the target for the

of the lanson screens efficacy

chance firing artillery into manhat-

without resonance ready general
ten minutes for the first try

  lanson lumbers back to his ma-
chine thrusts at a lever there is
no sound no vibration suddenly
the river the palisades disappear
the amusement park is gone the in-
verted necklaces of pearly light that
mark the bridge cables there is no
sky lanson looks at his wristwatch

  ten minutes he chuckles he
couldnt get through in ten thousand

  he is very sure of himself this
man but perhaps there is a minute
residuum of doubt in his mind after
all he has never experimented with
so vast an extension of his inven-

chapter iii


in his cubicle on the hundred and
ninetieth floor of new york uni-
versitys physics building howard
cranston watched the moving needle
of his merton calculator with nar-
rowed eyes if the graph that was
slowly tracing itself on the result-
sheet took the expected form a prob-
lem that had taxed the ingenuity of
the worlds scientists for sixty years
would be solved at last

  the lanky young physicist could
not know it but the electrically op-
erated brain was repeating in
thirty minutes calculations it had
taken henry lanson three years to
perform two generations before his
own contribution had been only an
idea and knowledge of the proper
factors to feed into the machine

  a red line curved on the coor-
dinate sheet met a previously drawn
blue one a bell tinkled and there
was silence in the room

  breath came from between crans-
tons lips in a long sigh curiously
he felt no elation

  he crossed the room slowly and
looked out through the glassite-
covered aperture in the south wall
just below elevated highways were
a tangled maze in the afternoon sun
and helicopters danced like a cloud
of weaving midges but cranston
neither heard nor saw them his
gaze was fixed farther away toward
where a curious cloud humped
against the horizon a cloud that was
a challenging pile of vacancy-
something that existed that occu-
pied space yet wras nothing

  beyond it he could see the shim-
the lanson screen



mering surface of new york bay
and rising from it a tall white shaft
at the apex of that shaft a colossal
figure faced him it was a gigantic
woman of bronze her head bowed
her hands pressed to her heavy
breasts that agonized in frustration
the universal mother stood in eter-
nal mourning over the visible but
unseen grave of millions

  it might be dangerous harold
cranston muttered the gases of
the decomposed bodies-there was
no way for them to escape before i
start building the machine i must
find out carl langdon will know

  he turned away but first ill
draw it up its simple enough-
will take less than a week to build

  the design that presently took
pictured form under harold crans-
tons flying fingers was strangely
like that which  years before
henry lanson had called his b ma-
chine but there was a difference
this one could be used from outside
the screen

  with the aid of this by expanding
the radius to include the original
barrier it would be a simple matter
to destroy the hemiobloid of impene-
trable force that was a citys tomb
to release the force which lanson
had set up

  rand barndons flivver - plane
settled before a graceful small struc-
ture of metal and glass he swung
his rather squat body out of the fuse-
lage crunched up the gravel path

  the door opened irislike as he
stepped into the beam of the photo-
ray somewhere inside a deep-toned
gong sounded and tiny pattering
feet made running sound daddy
daddys home

  blond ringlets were an aureole
around tiny robs chubby face the
father bent to him tossed him in the
air caught him dexterously ruth
barndon appeared taller than her
husband her countenance a maturer
more-feminine replica of the boys
rob was a warm bundle against her
breasts as her lips met rands

youre late hon suppers been

  i know we were talking about
what they found down there he
gestured vaguely to the south one
of the fellows flew down last night
they wouldnt let him land but he
saw enough hovering on the five-
thousand-foot level to keep him
awake all night

  ruth paled shuddered what an
awful thing it must have been you
know nobody ever thought much
about it the cloud has been there
all our lives and it really didnt seem
to mean anything but seeing all
those buildings where people just
like us once lived and worked seeing
those-

  afterward dear ruth caught
the signal of the mans eyes to the
quietly listening child and stopped

grave the impact of a strong per-
sonality reaches out from the tele-
vised image vibrant with a stagey
dominance even over the miles of
space intervening between actuality
and reproduction

  oh its grant lowndes ruth
breathes i love him

 shhh barndon is intent
skhh

  the radio commissions premier
reader moves with practised grace
an adept at building up interest in
trivialities by pantomimed porten-
tousness lowndes is weaving a spell
about his far-flung audience that will
assure him concentrated attention

  as he sinks into the seat his eyes
stare from the screen with hypnotic
penetration he places a book on the
table before him its covers are of
tooled leather but there is a smudge
of green mould across them conceal-
ing the design he opens it

  the pages are yellow frayed-
edged faded handwriting is visible
minuscular an old diary perhaps
picked up from some dusty second-
hand display

  good evening friends his
voice is mellow warming vibrant
with a peculiar tensity ruths tiny
stifled gasp is a tribute to its art
the manufacturers of general
flyers helioplanes have honored me
tonight with a great privilege and
a sad task

  i bring to you a voice from the
past a voice long silent speech from
a throat long mouldered into dust

thoughts from a brain whose very
molecules are one with the snows of
yesteryear i bring to you the pal-
pitant living agony of the greatest
catastrophe the world has ever
known his eyes drop to the volume
on the lectern and his slim white
hand presses down upon its face

  my colleagues of the viewcast
service have informed you of the
rending of the veil that sixty-two
years ago cut off manhattan island
from the world they have brought
into your homes the awful vision of
dead buildings of dead streets
strewn with twisted skeletons

  you have i am sure tried to pic-
ture what must have happened there
in the tragic days till eternal silence
fell and the entombed city had be-
come a vast necropolis today my
friends the searchers found an ac-
count of one mans experience a
painstakingly written chronicle of
that time general flyers is spon-
soring the presentation to you of
this human pitiful tale i will quote
from the diaiy

chapter iv
the doom within

may  thursday it is four in
the morning aloysia came here
with me from the theatre  i have
just returned from escorting her to
the place where she resides she
does not call it home-that name
she reserves for these rooms

  home felix she said is the
place where happiness dwells i
recognized that-it is a line from
one of her earlier appearances her
mind is a blotter seizing the
thoughts the ideas the mental
images of others and becoming im-
pregnated with them no-molding
itself to them perhaps that is the
secret of her arts-dramatic and-
amatory
the lanson screen



  i am restless uneasy there is a
peculiar feeling in the air a vague
sense of impending catastrophe
even the recollection of the past
few hours with her does not drive
it away   

  i thought music might fit my
mood but the radio is out of gear
tonight nothing but silence
strangely enough the police talk is
roaring in there seems to be some
trouble along the waterfront  

  it ought to be getting close to
dawn but it is still pitch dark out-
side there isnt any breeze the
sky is absolutely black i have never
seen anything like it in new york
clouds at night always reflect the
glow of the city lights and if there
are no clouds there should be stars
a moon can there be a storm com-
ing down on the big city-a tornado
that would explain the wtay i feel

  may  friday there has been
no daylight today the only illumi-
nation is artificial somehow that
seems the worst of what has hap-
pened to the city for something
has happened manhattan is sur-
rounded by an impenetrable barrier
nobody nothing can get in or out
there have been no trains at grand
central or penn station the subway
is operating only within the borders
of manhattan island

  i have been driving around with
aloysia all day in spite of the dark-
ness things went on very much as
usual in the morning children went
to school toilers to their work it
dawned only gradually that more
than half the staffs in offices and
stores had not shown up-those who
do not live in manhattan

  at noon the newspapers came out
with scare headlines every bridge
out of the city is closed off by the
veil of-what can i call it every
pier a cover has shut down over
us as if manhattan were a platter
on which a planked steak is being
brought from the kitchen of the ritz-
plaza even the telephone and tele-
graph have been affected

  by three in the afternoon the
whole city was in the streets my
car was forced to move at a crawl
there was no sign of fear though
the general consensus was that the
phenomenon was something thrill-
ing a welcome break in the hum-
drum of daily existence

  the mayors proclamation in the
newspapers and over the few radio
stations located within the citv
seemed quite superfluous he urged
the people to be calm whatever it
was that had shut us in was only
temporary it would vanish of itself
or a way would be found to get rid
of it

  he has appointed a committee of
scientists from columbia and the
city colleges to investigate and
make plans the best of them all
however is unavailable-henry
lanson he was found crushed to
death on a hudson river pier killed
in some obscure experiment

  aloysia left me in time for the
evening performance the theaters
and movie houses are crowded-they
have had the best day in their his-
tory

  at ten oclock tonight i went to
take a drink of water none ran
from the tap i called the superin-
tendent and he said the mains had-
been shut off there was no longer
any pressure police orders are that
water is to be used only for drinking
and cooking

  it is being pumped from the main
by fire engines stationed at the hy-
drants and a rationing system has
been devised i have two or three
cases of perrier-they should be
sufficient for my needs till this thing
is over there is plenty of wine and
scotch but i have no desire for alco-
hol

may  saturday the darkness
still continues no milk was de-
livered this morning prices for food
have begun to go up there is very
little fresh meat to be had practical-
ly no vegetables or fruits evapo-
	wonder story annual

rated milk is being sold at a dollar
a can i am afraid the children are
going to suffer a great deal

 may  sunday church was
packed there have been several
riots in the poorer sections of the
city grocery stores raided a ware-
house gutted the militia has been
called out and all stocks of food
taken over by the authorities for
rationing

  aloysia has just appeared bag
and baggage she says she feels safe
only here i am going out to see
what is going on

  two p m there is no longer
any w-ater in the system the lakes
in central park are being emptied
the fluid taken to breweries and dis-
tilleries nearby where the water is
being filtered and chlorinated the
little thus obtained and canned fruit
juices furnish the only drink for
children adults are drinking beer
and wine

  my car was stopped by a detail of
national guardsmen in uniform no
gasoline engines are to be run any
longer there is no escape for the
carbon monoxide fumes being gener-
ated and they are poisoning the at-
mosphere there already have been
several deaths from this cause

  a fire started in an apartment
house on third avenue it was ex-
tinguished by chemicals i wonder
how long that will be efficacious 

  i thought i was fairly well stocked
up for at least a week but with
aloysia here her maid and my own
man my stock of food and drink-
ables is rapidly disappearing for
the first time i have sent jarvis out
to the food depots with an affidavit
setting forth the size of my family
my residence etc i understand that
each adult is being allotted one can
of meat or vegetables and one pint of
water per day

  three p m all house lights have
been turned off to conserve coal i
am writing by candle street light-
ing is still maintained there has
been no gas since the darkness fell

the plant being in astoria

  as my own kitchen has an electric
range this did not impress me but

i	understand those not so taken care
of have been displaying remarkable
ingenuity several families upended
electric laundry irons and used those
as grills that is ended now how-
ever there is so little to cook that
the lack of heat hardly brings added
hardship

  jarvis has not yet returned

 midnight from my window i
can overlook quite a large portion
of the city a vast black pall rests
over us relieved only by the net-
work of glowing lamps outlining the
streets even these seem to be grow-
ing dimmer

  my valet jarvis is still among the
missing he has been with me for
ten years i thought him loyal
honest he ivas honest with respect
to money i have trusted him with
large sums and never found him
faithless but money is worth noth-
ing today while food   

  stress reveals the inner nature of
the human animal i met the har-
rison-smiths today walking along
park avenue in the foreboding rest-
lessness that is keeping all new york
on the sidewalks

  the usually iron-visaged banker
presented a countenance whose color
matched the clammy hue of a dead
fishs belly his heavy jowls were
dewiaps quivering with fear even
while we talked his eyes clung to his
wife who was erect a bright white
flame in the darkness

  her eyes were answering the ap-
peal in his she had strength enough
for both and was keeping him from
collapse by sheer silent will the
gossips this winter were buzzing
about anita and ted van norden
the wastrel who reminds me so much
of my own youth there could have
been little if any truth in the rumors

  may  monday noon i went
out at five this morning to take my
place in the long line at the food
station i have just returned with
the lanson screen



my booty one can of sardines and
a six-ounce bottle of soda-to main-
tain three adults twenty-four hours
on my way back i saw a man well-
dressed chasing an alley cat he
caught it killed it with a blow of his
fist and stuffed it in a pocket

  the air is foul with stench a
white hearse passed me being
pushed by men on foot someone told
me that central park is being used
as a burying ground

 stopped to watch the passing
hearse near a national guards-
man a slim young chap whose uni-
form did not fit him very well he
spoke to me thats the worst of
this thing sir what its doing to
children under his helmet his eyes
were pits of somber fire

  just think of the babies without
milk the canned stuff gave out to-
day my own kid is sick in bed he
cant stand the junk weve been giv-
ing him june-thats my wife-
is clean frantic

  i wanted to comfort him but what
was there to say how old is your
youngster i asked

  junior is two-and a swell brat
you ought to hear him talk a mile
a minute hes going to be a lawyer
when he grows up

   listened to him for awhile then
made some excuse and got away i
had to or he would have seen that
my eyes were wet

  later aloysia has slept all day
all the windows in the apartment
are open but the air is heavy stifling
it is difficult to move to breathe
the shell that encloses us is immense
but eventually the oxygen in the en-
closed air must be used up then
what

  unless relief comes soon death
will be beforehand the mass death
of all the teeming population of this
island one must face that just
what form will it take starvation
thirst asphyxiation queer-i who
have so often babbled of the futility
of life do not want to die

  it is-unpleasant-to contemplate
utter extinction the absolute end of
self i wish i believed in immortality
in some sort of future life even to
burn eternally in hell would be better
than simply-to stop

  there is a red glow to the south
is it a thinning of the darkness

  the city seems hushed with all
traffic noise stopped but another
sound has replaced it-a high-
pitched murmur not loud but omni-
present insistent i have just real-
ized what it is children crying-
thousands of them hundreds of
thousands hungry children-
thirsty children

  may  tuesday the clock says
it is morning it is not dark outside
any more a red light suffuses the
scene the light of the gigantic flame
that has enveloped all the lower end
of the island there is no wind the
conflagration is spreading very
slowly but it is coming inexorably

  overhead are vast rolling billows
of smoke edged with scarlet glare
below there is a turbulent sea of
human beings the roar of the fire
pent-in and reverberant mingles
with the crash of breaking glass
the rattle of rifle shots a growling
animal-like sound that is the voice
of the mob

  they are engaged in a carnival of
destruction a blind mad venting of
protest against the doom that has
overtaken them

  i had a dog once that was run
over by some fool in a truck when
i went to pick it up it snarled and
sank its teeth in my hand that is
like those people down there they
do not know what has hurt them
but they must hurt someone in re-
turn

  where they find the strength to
fight i do not know i can scarcely
move my tongue fills my mouth
it is almost impossible to breathe

  aloysia has just called me it was
the ghost of a word her felix
in a moment i shall go in to her
and lie down beside her

  grant lowndes looks up from the
book that is all he says simply
in an inner room of the apartment
where this was found the searchers
discovered two skeletons on the
mouldering ruin of a bed a mans
and a womans

  general flyers bids you good
night i shall be with you again at
this same hour on friday

  he turns and goes slowly out
through the grey curtains the diary
remains on the little gray table
shadows close in from the edges of
the screen concentrating light with-
in their contracting circle the
book is the last thing visible that
too is gone

  there is silence in the living-room
for a long minute rand barndon
reaches to the radiovisor switch

clicks it off the screen is blankly
white in the glow of the room light

 you know barndon says
slowly the city wasnt all burned
up guess the fire burned up all the
oxygen and put itself out that was
what killed the people too

  ruth sighs tremulously rand
i was thinking about that one thing
he said about that soldier that was
worried about his sick little boy
just think if anything like that were
to happen to our rob

  say i noticed that too the fel-
low had a good idea thats what
were going to make of the kid a

hard work well send him to dart-

turned from borneo with a two-
headed snake and a dyak boy with
a pair of singing parakeets when
the big boss-thats joe wallace-

feel like patting me on the back and
handing me a cigar then sudden-
like he jammed a newspaper into
my hand and pointed to a headline

three wise men come out
of future

ambassadors from tomorrow appear
at long island house party

scientists astounded

    long- island city july -a house
  party at the country estate of oliver
  p mawson millionaire automobile
  manufacturer came to an abrupt and
  thrilling termination last right with
  the appearance of three uninvited
  guests

  with more than two hundred famous
people present including leading fig-
ures in artistic scientific and financial
circles the party had reached its
height at about  a m when a terrific
explosion shook the sumptuous maw-
son mansion shouts were heard from
the lawn outside and excited guests
streamed into the night

  a startling spectacle greeted them
the entire western sky was lit up by
a strange greenish light rising from
a little hill a hundred yards away
and in that unearthly glow they saw
a huge polished metal cylinder
sprawled on the hillside its lower end
twisted and torn by the explosion
which had gouged and blasted the hill-
top uprooting several young trees

  as the guests reached the hill they
heard sounds within the metal cylinder
and one after another three strange
small men crawled out almost iden-
tical in appearance they were little
more than four feet in height and their
bodies were covered only by white
sleeveless shirts of some soft silky
material and flaring white shorts
they seemed amazingly thin and frag-
ile though tanned a golden brown
their heads completely bald were
enormous fully twice the size of nor-
mal human heads and their faces
thin almost to the point of emaciation
were old and wrinkled with deeply
shrunken eyes and thin indrawn lips
the whole somehow grotesquely out of
proportion with their huge heads

scientist interviewed

  in an interview roger st john
noted astronomer and writer stated
i never saw a more startling spec-
tacle that green glow which seemed
to emanate from the very earth of the
hilltop cloaked those three little men
with an air of the unearthly it
stunned us there was something al-
most juvenile in their faces yet with
it was something so incredibly ancient
that-well it marked them as crea-
tures of another world-or time

  it seemed almost as though they
had stepped from the pages of a
wellsian fantasy-men from the fu-
ture when one of them spoke his
voice was peculiarly flat and bore an
indescribable accent

   a slight miscalculation lon he
said doubtless due to the changing
contour of the terrestrial surface
we should have raised our supports
two feet higher

   fortunate that our miscalculation
had no more regrettable result than
the loss of our time-drive replied the
second little man dryly
three wise men



    the third waved a hand toward
  us and said in the same flat voice
  we have an audience friends and
  the three walked slowly down the hill-
  side

come out of future

    after the excited throng had es-
  corted the strange visitors into the
  great ballroom of mawson manor and
  subsided to a point where intelligent
  conversation could be carried on the
  three introduced themselves as lon
  st-- ander cw-- and
  ken mb-- visitors from the
  forty-third century a d or the year
   new era they had come back
  into the past so they said to view at
  first hand what their history indicated
  was the first year of the new era-
  this very year

    there followed an animated discus-
  sion during which the visitors were
  dubbed the three wise men for
  they revealed a startling knowledge
  about everything the effect of this
  discovery was startling   

  whats that sarge    well
okay anyway maybe it gives you
an idea how i felt when i looked at
joe wallace after id finished read-
ing the thing i opened my mouth-
dont say it dorion he snapped
im dumb enough to give you credit
for having a little brains-an if you
try to tell me youre failin for this
time-travelin bunk im liable to get
sore

 you scram over to that mawson
guys joint an stay there till things
break sooner or later the bottomll
fall outa the story these three big-
headed freaks are dishing up an
when it does i want you there to
sign em

  i didnt waste much time getting
out to mawsons little fifty-acre es-
tate on long island but getting in-
side was something else a faked
reporters card didnt work neither
did a black bag a pair of spectacles
and a doctors front so-well i got
in but i was glad there didnt hap-
pen to be any police around

after i brushed the dust off my
soup-and-fish there wasnt any-
one could tell me from the other
guests when i first saw those

three little men-well it was an ex-
perience the papers hadnt
stretched things a bit boy i fig-
ured if joe wallace could get them
we sure had three world-beaters on
our hands

  this guy mawson had sort of set
himself up as proud father and legal
guardian of the three-and let me
tell you he did things right some
of those feeds of his would set you
back twenty bucks in a manhattan
hash house

  the second day mawson arranged
an interview with the press never
saw such a mob of reporters before
or since the scientists were there
and-well when the lid blew off and
the physics astronomy higher
mathematics biology and all the
rest of that bunk started flying
around sort of casual-like the three
wise men got to telling the scientific
big shots where to head in those
little guys knew everything

  there was one egg there a french
scientist who thought he was
pretty hot stuff seems hed writ-
ten a book called atoms protons
and positrons the building blocks
of the universe the way he looked
at it there was nothing more to be
said

 he mentioned his work and
ander-he was the only one of the
three with a sense of humor-
started spouting a chapter of the
book word for word just sat there
looking at nothing while the sylla-
bles rolled out in that flat hollow
voice

  i could see the frenchman swell-
ing up like a balloon-not thinking
of the brains this little man had but
of how important his work was to
be remembered two thousand years
in the future

  then ander said sort of soft and
gentle we preserve some of the
more absurd of the ancient writings
as entertainment for the children
a counterpart i should say of your
fairy tales

  when the reporters left at the


wonder story annual

end of three or four hours the three
wise men were headed for the big-
gest splash of publicity that ever hit
anybody i still remember some of
those headlines

  there were pictures by the
dozens pictures of the three pic-
tures of their machine-what was
left of it after the souvenir hunters
got through with it

  funny but there was one big an-
gle that everybodyd overlooked at
first but when it struck it socked
about forty million people all at once
if these little birds had come out of
the future they must know some
history that hadnt happened as yet

  and you know sarge theres
nothing a man wouldnt give to
know whats going to break tomor-
row or the next day think how
swell it would be for a guy playing
the market and these three with
their super - memories - well it
looked like a natural

  about forty million phone calls
telegrams and letters struck mawson
manor at the same time could
he three wise men tell the history
of the future they could and
would

  oliver p mawson arranged it
hes a big fat man about six-feet-
two with round red cheeks like a
pair of apples and eyes as bright
as two blue marbles-and hes just
as hard worked his way up from
a laborer in an auto plant to become
one of the richest men in the coun-
try

  with mawson pulling the strings
the three wise men were scheduled
for a big television broadcast on a
world hook-up that was just a few
months before the presidential elec-
tion and the three crowded the
candidates right off the air waves

as for the broadcast-well
everybody had heard of the
three had read what they had said
-and now they could see them and
hear them and they said plenty
they told of the big yellow war of

seventy years from now

  they told-but i guess you heard
the broadcast about this new era
business and this year being the first
of the new era the beginning of a
slow unbroken march toward
genuine civilization and they sajd
how a man by the name of doctor
michel stoner would be the one to
take the first big step forward
michel stoner the next president of
the united states they said

  let me tell you sarge that rocked
the great american public back on
their heels who was doctor michel
stoner nobodyd ever heard of him
yet the three said he was going to
be the next president

  the paper s-y o u remember
sarge-played it up big michel
stoner the man of destiny who
wras he where was he

  so they started hunting for michel
stoner m d some reporter found
out that about twenty-five years ago
hed practised medicine in a little
pennsylvania town and that hed
dropped that to take over a profes-
sors chair in a college so small they
didnt even have a paid football
team-and that was all hed simply
disappeared

  the search went on until at last
they found him in a little four-room
cabin in the massachusetts hills
about a hundred miles from no-
where didnt even have a radio
hadnt seen a newspaper in two
months nobody around there knew
anything about him except that
about once every three months or so
he drove out of the hills in a dilapi-
dated flivver to buy gasoline food
and books

  the books they remembered most
cause there was always a lot of them
waiting in the post office marked
m stoner general delivery i think
it was through the publishers he was
finally located

  well if nobody knew anything
about him at first it didnt take
them long to find out oliver p
himself drove up there in a plati-
three wise men	

num-plated rolls and carried him
back to mawson manor and of
course there was another big world
broadcast with mawson the master
of ceremonies the three wise men
were there with bells on and
stoner-well sarge if you saw and
heard that broadcast youll have to
admit he made some impression

  i dont care if you do have him be-
hind the bars i told you hes in-
nocent-and im here to prove it to
you i have another clipping 

 now wait a minute sarge-just
this one thisll be the last one ill
read you see i make scrap books
of the things im interested in-
helps me keep a record listen

world broadcast startles
vast audience

dr michel stoner makes amazing
impression

will run for office

   new york city aug -dr
 michel stoner the recluse from the
 massachusetts hills will be an inde-
 pendent candidate in the forthcoming
 presidential election he revealed that
 last night after a world television
 broadcast in which he proved to be
 one of the most impressive figures
 ever to reach the telescreens

     despite his earlier decision to leave
  politics to others dr stoner found the
  american public so overwhelmingly
  insistent on his running for office that
  he felt impelled to yield to their de-
  mands

    dr stoner faced an audience burn-
  ing with curiosity to see the man men-
  tioned by the three wise men as the
  first president of the new era of
  average height and rather slender in
  build ne is at once a figure of quiet
  power impressive dignity and mag-
  netic personality

    his head is crowned with a mass of
  snow-white hair and his voice-
  never has such a resonant voice
  borne so much wisdom on the one
  hand and beauty of diction on the
  other in dr michel stoner america
  has discovered a genius

    for the past twenty years doctor
  stoner has been engaged in the writ-
  ing of a voluminous and comprehen-
  sive work tentatively entitled man
  and the way of man

    in his manuscript already more

 than two million words in length
 doctor stoner has discussed in full
 detail the development of man since
 the dawn of reason up to the present
 and into the future if the numerous
 quotations from his work are an in-
 dication he possesses a rare insight
 into human behavior and character

new era dawning

                                          

   man he says has reached the
 threshold of vast new truths the
 doors of knowledge are swinging aside
 old thoughts ana methods of thinking
 are passing away to be displaced by
 a newer more rational consciousness
 long-standing fears disorders and
 superstitions are yielding to an im-
 posing array of new knowledge like a
 tidal wave sweeping everything before
 it and man rides like foam on its
 crest

   a new era is dawning a new age
 when all mankind will be welded into
 one vast spiritual whole one tremen-
 dous world community in which the
 term war will have no meaning
 someone with cosmic understanding
 someone in whom the world conscious-
 ness has awakened into fullness of life
 will lead you but it should be some-
 one wiser far than i-someone whose
 name i do not yet know

 yeah sarge i suppose that is
enough seems like everybody else
thought so too for it was only about
ten minutes after he left the air that
demands started pouring in for him
to run for president

 what a howl went up in certain
quarters when the doc started his
campaign after all this guys
speeches were the kind that got prac-
tically anything they asked for and
with the three wise men on his
side it looked like a sure thing for
the dark horse

 the democrats kicked because
they figured they had had the thing
in the bag and the republicans
kicked because they thought-or at
least hoped-that this time theyd
be able to upset the mule

but the howls were only straws
in a cyclone no one paid much
attention to the other candidates
a blind man could see that stoner
was slated to go in with the biggest


wonder story annual

majority in history what was the
use in voting against a man who
future records showed had been
elected and with the three for him
and mawsons millions behind him-
well sarge it was some set-up

  i didnt see much of the three big-
shots those days nor much of stoner
or mawson either they still made
the big long island mansion their
headquarters but they were too busy
to spend much time with a fiock of
perpetual house guests

  i figure theyd have given us our
walking papers if it hadnt been for
the scientists but they made com-
pany for the three and good copy
for the tabloids anyway i was in
and enjoying it

  but after awhile my conscience
started working i remembered joe
wallace and here i was swimming
and playing tennis with a pair of
swell dames eating so much that
id put on an average of two pounds
a week and-well i decided to get
busy

  it took about a week for me to
get the hang of the place then one
night when i was playing detective
i stumbled on something big thered
been some big doings in philadelphia
-stoner was given the keys to the
burg a big parade speeches and
everything that went with it theyd
come back to mawson manor all
played out

  i was sliding along one of those
big corridors when i heard voices-
maw sons bark stoners smooth
deep baritone and the flat creaking
voices of the three and they didnt
sound like they were chinning just
to pass the time away

  get this stoner i heard maw-
son say and his words sort of cut
like a knife youre not backing
out you couldnt even if id let
you and im not letting you see
theres too much involved in this
for things to topple now so forget
it

  i cant forget it stoner said as
solemn as a funeral im tired of

the whole thing i wish youd never
found me

then one of the three spoke-i
think it was lon were tired too
and he certainly sounded tired-
like a guy with insomia who hadnt
slept for months

  tired mawsons voice cracked
then go to bed-get some sleep
tomorrow youll be over this
nonsense ive got enough to worry
about without this got another
threatening letter today-this one
i think from the ernisto mob the
politicians are back of em im cer-
tain but i cant prove it the police
-they cant do a damn thing and
whered we be if the three wise
men were kidnaped

  lheard a door slam and i beat it
down the hall-fast

  i didnt sleep so well that night
what id heard took heavy thinking
stoner was tired of the whole thing
tired of what of running for
president  or of being a big fake 

  then i thought of those strange
big-headed little men with their
young eyes and old voices and i
didnt know what to think and this
talk of kidnaping-there hadnt been
even a whisper about it in the
papers big things were starting to
break and i could only wait

  i dragged through the next two
days in a sort of fog waiting for
something to happen and when i
woke up on the morning of the third
day it had happened all right-
cracked wide open

  three wise men kidnaped

  the tabloids screamed it in the
biggest headlines since the lind-
bergh case the telescreens snapped
or roared it at a wholesale rate id
been half expecting it yet it knocked
the wind out of me

  it seemed doctor stoner and the
three had been returning late from
a trip to the studios mawson had
been delayed on a lonely stretch of
road theyd run out of gas-how was
a mystery since the gauge registered
three wise men	

full mustve been tampered with
the chauffeur had walked back to-
ward the last gas station theyd
passed and when hed come back
car wise men and presidential
candidate had disappeared

you know all that sarge better
than i do-and you know how
they found stoner the next day
lying in the back of a car as sick
as a dog and the smell of chloro-
form strong enough to choke an
elephant

  he told how a big sedan had pulled
up and four men with tommy-guns
had ordered the three into their ma-
chine and had doped him that was
all he knew till the cops found him
and the mileage gauge had been
smashed   

  oh i know its all old stuff to you
but ive got to tell this in my own
way i dont want to skip anything
important see

  well in mawson manor things
resembled a first-class madhouse
the big boss tore things wide open
doctor stoner was confined to his
room prostrated by shock

  and then the police came in
droves and sort of suddenlike i got
the idea that it was time for tom
dorion to scram i was the unin-
vited guest and id have a tough
time talking myself out of this spot
if the police caught up with me

  in town i hung around my room
waiting to see what would happen
next there wasnt much-just the
delivery of the first ransom note
demanding one million dollars for
each of the three letters clipped
out of newspapers and pasted on a
sheet of bond paper by a guy wear-
ing gloves no fingerprints-no
nothing

  you picked up a lot of mobsters
that first week didnt you sarge
and you looked for a house guest
who had disappeared on the day
after the kidnaping a guy nobody
seemed to know much about-only
you couldnt find him

  and after a little while you found
out you hadnt accomplished any-
thing the papers made it hot for
the police commissioner and he
made it hot for everybody under
him you sweated a flock of mob-
sters-and it didnt mean a thing

  it was about that time that i de-
cided id better get busy joe wal-
lace had told me to stick with the
three wise men till id signed em
up for his shows and here id let em
be kidnaped under my very nose

  i sort of thought things over and
i got a hunch you see i couldnt
get that little conversation between
mawson stoner and the three out of
my dome so i hired a flivver and
headed for the massachusetts hills

  that little cabin of michel stoners
wasnt the easiest place in the world
to find but i found it i guess i was
about two blocks from the place
when i parked the rattling wreck i
was driving and sort of crept up to-
ward the joint it was a nifty little
hideaway

  it took me about a half an hour to
cover a couple hundred yards i
didnt figure there was much danger
if my hunch was right but i
couldnt be sure so i didnt take any
chances if those hardboiled boys
with the hair grease and the tommy-
guns were mixed up in this-well it
might not be so healthy for tom
dorion

  but i finally got there and sort of
eased my eyes up over a window
sill there they were-the three
wise men and nobody else it took
me just about one second to get
around to the door let me tell you
sarge i felt good this was a break
here was my chance if i didnt
get their names on some kind of a
contract it wouldnt be my fault

  when i knocked on the door and
one of them answered come in
some of the pep went out of me
honest sarge i never heard any-
thing as-as lifeless as that voice
so flat and dull almost like i was
hearing the dead talking if you get


wonder story annual

what i mean

  there they were sprawled out
across a cot bed hardly moving-
they always were queer-looking
birds but now it seemed like they
were centuries old-as though they
were shrinking drying up before my
eyes

  good morning gentlemen i
said cheery-like thought id stop
in an say hello

  anders answered and he didnt
even move his head we are glad
you came we are so-tired we
have lived beyond our-allotted
span soon we shall die and it is
not good to die alone

if you dont think that just about
floored me sarge youre crazy
there i was with the best attrac-
tions that ever hit the show game
practically in the palm of my hand
and they were dying

  for a second i didnt say a word
just stared from one to another i
still remember half seeing the rest
of the room-a little stove with an
empty frying pan on it and a coffee
percolator rows and rows of books

  lon pulled himself up on one
elbow there can be no mistake
he whispered and thats all it was a
hoarse whisper we know we have
but little time in this life that is
why we left doctor-doctor stoner
arranged it though he did not real-
ize-how it was with us we would
like to see him before-we die

  ken the third little man sat up
and i could see it took a terrific ef-
fort his eyes burned out at me
like two hot coals out of two hollow
pits-coals that were burning to
ashes

  we are old-so terribly old he
croaked yet we are so-young
and the end is close a thin hand
pointed toward the desk there in
the upper drawer on that side is a
little book get it

  in a sort of trance i went over to
the desk i found the book

  that explains thing s-which

should be known ken slumped
back on the bed

  look i said isnt there some-
thing i can do  my thoughts were
going around in circles but i felt i
had to do something

  ander moved his head from side
to side no one can help us we
know but you can get doctor
stoner to-come here-before we
pass on there may be time-if he
hurries

  i sort of slid toward the door
okay okay ill rush i said ill
get him just hang on

  the next thing i knew i was hot-
footing it up the winding road to-
ward the flivver and let me tell
you i sent that old can rolling like
she never rolled before id passed
through a little town about fifteen
miles back and i headed that way
with the accelerator jammed against
the floorboard

  i guess  reached the place in
about twenty minutes though it
seemed like hours but i got there
finally and i put in a long distance
call for the mawson estate a cop
answered i think it didnt take him
long to get doc stoner on the wire
when i bellowed it was a matter of
life or death

  i spilled the story to stoner in a
few words but he didnt even let
me finish i heard a sort of choking
cry then i heard the receiver crash
on the hook i got out of there in a
hurry i didnt want to be around
when the fireworks started

  you know what happened better
than i do stoner tearing out of the
mansion like a lunatic grabbing
that big rolls royce of mawsons
and roaring away before anyone
could even think of stopping him

  nobody but stoner knows what
happened up to the time the cops ar-
rived about an hour behind him i
have a good idea but its only an
idea anyway when the police got
there as you know sarge they
found the doctor sitting on a stump
in the weed-grown garden behind
three wise men



the cabin and the cabin-it was
half burned down by that time a
little later there were only smoking
ashes

  and doctor stoner just sat there
and stared and hed only say in a
sort of dull dry voice theyre
dead and thats their funeral pyre
no one will ever know

  but he didnt kill em sarge i
tell you hes innocent they just
died

  heres how i dope it out sarge
oliver p mawson was behind the
whole thing you ought to be able
to see that yourself with my telling
you about that argument i heard he
got the big idea when he stumbled
across stoners cabin while driving
through the hills up there those
three little guys with their big
heads must have started his imagi-
nation working

  huh sure they were there all
the time dont tell me you fell for
that time-traveling bunk mawson
staged the whole thing ill bet when
you check on it youll find he had
the time-machine built in his auto-
mobile factories

  and of course since he couldnt
very well fake a time-traveling en-
gine he had to have that explosion
to destroy it it was good publicity
stuff too made a swell spectacle
with a little chemical of some sort
spilled on the ground

it was power he wanted-power
he had so much money he couldnt
keep track of it and that could buy
quite a bit of power-but not
enough hed been a little guy who
had worked himself up from no-
where and it had gone to his head
he wanted to be dictator of america
-and he almost got what he was
after

  sure with these fake men from
the future he planned to have stoner
elected to the presidency with him-
self of course the power behind the
throne and a little later on with
those same three wise men paving

the way hed take over the control
of the government it was a per-
fect setup-only something bigger
than oliver p stepped in

  whered the three come from
thats where that little black book
comes in-my ace in the hole thats
what will save michel stoner from
the chair or the bughouse ive got
it here its stoners diary with a
daily record covering the last twenty
odd years

  of course ill give it to you sarge
-but you cant read shorthand can
you lean listen to this-the first
entry that interests us years back-

  march third nineteen-hundred-
thirty ann is dead it was too much
for her god forgive me but i did
all a man could do she was always
so frail and those endless hours of
travail were more than she could
bear what will i do i can hardly
see the page before me

  and those three mites theyre
such pitiful little things their
heads are enormous victims of
hydrocephalus obviously i must
save them-or her death will be com-
pletely futile

  ive looked up that word hydro-
cephalus sarge it means water on
the brain heres what a guy named
blakeslee says about it a lot of it
is greek to me but youll get the
general idea

  hydrocephalus fluid effusion
within the cranium giving rise to a
more or less uniform stretching of
the cranial bones the sutures are
obviously stretched asunder accom-
panied by extreme enlargement of
the forehead

  frequently the eyes will appear
misplaced sometimes they look
very much deeper set than normal
in other cases they look as though
they were depressed as a result of
the downward pressure exerted by
the excess fluid upon the roof of the
orbits

  major degrees of hydrocephalus
cause such extreme enlargement of
the head coupled with such thinning


wonder story annual

of the bones and stretching of the
sutures that the diagnosis is almost
unmistakable 

  heres the next important entry-
the three boys are still alive
though that they can live at all with
such inadequate treatment is a
miracle i have only canned milk and
a prepared baby food and its a poor
substitute for mothers milk

  i buried ann out in the garden
beside the stump where she liked to
sit there was nothing else to do
i cant leave my three sons while
life remains in their little bodies
ive decided to try the glandular
treatment advocated by gardner for
the hydrocephalic condition
theres no use reading the entries
for the next few weeks sarge it was
touch and go for the three boys but
heres the entry for april twenty-
second-

  the danger for andrew alonzo
and kenneth is past they seem al-
most normal now though theyll al-
ways have abnormally large heads
i hope their minds are not affected
a cjefinite possibility since theirs was
such a severe case i left them alone
for the first time today while i drove
into town for some much needed
supplies

  it goes on that way sarge for
about seven years then you begin
to see doc stoner starting to get sort
of worried somethings wrong with
his boys finally he writes this-
may nineteenth nineteen-hun-
dred-thirty-seven lord what a
blunder im a disgrace to the medi-
cal profession to think that this
could have happened to my own
sons ive noticed a strangeness for
quite some time past and at last i
know what it is-progeria a glandu-
lar ailment so obscure that perhaps
only a half dozen are almost unmis-
takable

  im afraid-no certain--that
this condition is the result of my
treatment for the hydrocephalus i
know now that my boys will never

be normal at least physically men-
tally they seem far above average

  andrew is the most brilliant
though all three have truly amazing
memories already they have read
and memorized every book in my
library ill have to buy more books
perhaps they may develop into bril-
liant scientists or writers

  i looked that word progeria up
too sarge and what a time i had
heres the little information i got-

  progeria is primary spontaneous
infantilism mingled with premature
senility hence with shortness of
stature and other indications of in-
fantilism there are baldness emacia-
tion arteriosclerosis and general
decrepitude

  the ear lobule is absent the nasal
cartilages are conspicuous and the
fingers nodose owing to the promi-
nence of the epiphyses death from
angina pectoris or other senile
disease usually ensues in the early
twenties or sooner

  theres a lot there that i dont
understand sarge but i do knowr
this-the three wise men were
freaks built up by those two dis-
eases they looked like men from the
future-or at least like some writers
say theyll look mawson saw their
possibilities talked stoner into
showing them off-after all stoner
was proud of their brains-and got
the doctor to go into the thing him-
self when he saw what it was lead-
ing to he tried to go back out but
mawson wouldnt let him he faked
the kidnaping to upset mawsons
plans

  the three boys old men at twen-
ty-one died of old age and stoner
all broken up because his sons were
dead and probably blaming himself
burned their bodies with the cabin to
let them keep the little glory that
wras theirs

  ive spoiled that by telling you
this but anyway ive saved him from
the chair heres the diary sarge
theres a lot more dope in it i guess
id better report back to joe wallace

on the sea or in the air mutiny means violence-
and in space its the ultimate horror

youve never seen nona
guelph

no i said i never have
seen the lady

well here she comes if she
isnt a beauty im a motor-oiler
from the forward turtle deck un-

der the glassite dome of the star-
light arrow i peered down to the
landing stage where the arriving
passengers were crowding it was
interplanetary starways earth-
venus voyage twelve

 to grebbar venus august 




wonder story annual

  nona guelph was beautiful-tall
and slender with hair like spun gold
piled in a cone upon her head a
long dark cloak enveloped her as she
came with armed guards from the
escalator

  in the shadows of the turtle deck
just beyond the blue glare of the
morrel tube-lights young walter
wilson stood beside me he said
a beauty am i right

  no argument i agreed

  as she came up the boarding in-
cline her cloak parted disclosing her
slender form brief kirtle of blue
with gold-tasseled belt limbs like
pale pink marble wilsons leather
jacket hid the little banning heat-
gun which he held alert in his hand

  this daughter of the president of
the world federation was surround-
ed by uniformed guards young
wilson federal undercover man
was an added precaution assigned
for this voyage which was taking
nona guelph traveling alone to
grebbar to be guest of the young
daughter of the president of the
venus free state

  she reached the deck and wilson
stepped forward miss guelph i
am wilson-federated newsgath-
erer

   saw a look pass between them
the uniformed guards had remained
on the dock one secret bodyguard
as everyone knows is more effective
than ten in blatant uniform wil-
sons leather togs and the federated
newsgatherers insignia on his
peaked cap were an effective dis-
guise

  she knew he was her guard of
course her smile was gracious
even radiant it made my heart
thump as though i were an isolated
tower time-keeper who had never
seen a beatiful girl before

  federated news  she said
even in space must i be inter-
viewed 

  ill be generous wilson grinned
not till we pass the moons of

venus will i ask you a question
meet ken masters

  i gripped her cool slim hand her
blue-eyed gaze roved my white-linen
gold-braided uniform with the in-
signia of my rank striped on my
sleeve	

  third officer she said i am
honored then her smile faded
her hand went to wilsons arm her
voice was low furtive that venu-
sian down there-see him  his
name is felah bartano

we saw him-gigantic fellow
for a native of venus black
hair long to the base of his neck
with a red leather thong binding his
forehead in venus fashion he was
starting up the boarding incline a
passenger on this voyage

  watch him wilson nona mur-
mured im afraid of him i
have-

  easy i warned eavesdrop-
pers-

  wilson had a detector in the palm
of his hand no hostile eavesdrop-
ping ray was upon us but nona
abruptly added after the evening
meal come to my deck-chair her
gaze included me then as captain
davis approached to welcome her
she turned from us

  for a time my duties as third
officer of the starlight arrow
kept me busy we left the great-
new york stage at  p m earth
e s t the sun was setting at the
western horizon-but it rose with

  	the starlight arrow was a cylindrical alum-
ite hull a hundred feet long and forty feet in
diameter at its central breadth upon the turtle
deck a flfty-foot superstructure ten feet high
with a narrow deck space around it housed the
public rooms and the passengers cubbies dpon
the superstructure roof was the radio room the 
officers quarters were forward-and facing the
bow peak was the big circular control room
over the whole of this was the glassite dome a
convex transparent cover from stem to stem

  in the hull were the crews quarters the gal-
ley pneumatic mechanisms operating the plate-
shifters of the hulls gravity plates the pressure
equalizers chemical air renewers ventilators-
all the intricate mechanisms necessary to the
navigation of space

  the personnel of voyage twelve by official
records was officers and crew -passengers 
-the latter the usual mixture of earth and venus
people with a few martians
earth-venus 	

us as we slanted westward in our
climb through the atmosphere an
hours ascent with our rocket-tails
streaming like a comet behind us
-then we shut them off with the
gravity plates set for earth repul-
sion and the moon to pull us on the
first leg of the flight

  the usual number of passengers
suffered from pressure sickness-
the inevitable changes of tempera-
ture and air pressure-despite cap-
tain davis skill in handling the
arrows mechanism but everything
was all right once we passed the
stratosphere and entered interplan-
etary space

  for an hour or two that evening
the sunlight raked us full then
with course shifted we headed for
the moon and plunged presenty into
earths conical shadow glorious
black firmament with blazing white
star-dots-the moon a glowing
white disc and venus a blazing
point of light far off to one side
over our port quarter

  i did not see nona guelph during
the dinner hour her cubby was in
the superstructure forward almost
under the control turret with a lit-
tle segment of the side-deck under
the dome roped off for her excusive
use nor did i see young wilson

  the venusian felah bartano
went directly to his cubby and
stayed there but i saw him again
briefly as he came to the deck to
stare at the firmament through a
side bulls eye-a fellow as tall as
myself thirty years old perhaps
grey-skinned like all venusians his
erect muscular form was robed in a
long dark cloak-a commanding fig-
ure

  at  p m ships routine i was
momentarily free of duty i saw
nona come to her little deck space
and seat herself in a chair the
white glaring moonlight was on the
other side-deck the shining star-
light bathed the girls blue-clad fig-
ure with a silver sheen she saw
me beckoned me forward

  her smile was radiant anyone
observing us would have said that
she was a young girl intrigued by
my so-called handsome figure and
gold-braided uniform but her
tremulous voice belied that radiant
smile

  where is wilson

  i answered her smile-and as i
sat in the chair beside her suddenly
i felt as though unseen eyes must
be watching us i dont know i
murmured i havent-

  then abruptly like a materializ-
ing apparition wilson arrived com-
ing from a nearby corridor doorway
of the superstructure he sat smil-
ingly on the ami of my chair

  my business is to watch you
miss guelph he said softly i saw
the little detector in the palm of his
hand he said tell us now what
you meant

  that man bartano she said
hurriedly then she told us that
when the daughter of the president
of the venus free state had visited
her in washington last conjunction
they had talked of the revolution in
the dark country of venus which
was threatening her fathers gov-
ernment

  that revolution had grown into a
real menace its leader was de-
manding earth recognition of his
government-an important thing
for with it would come the legal
right to import munitions of war
from earth-those diabolical elec-
tronic earth weapons which the
scientists of venus and mars have
never been able to duplicate

this man bartano nona said
vehemently im sure he is the
same man who was watching us
that day in washington a native
of the venus free state-but a
traitor-a spy of the dark coun-
try

  you think so well ill report it
to captain davis i told her well

    yy

  easy wilson said now look


wonder story annual

here miss guelph-

  and did you know the girl add-
ed that on this voyage our cargo
is supposed to be the usual freight
-but in reality it is weapons of war
for the grebbar government to use
against the dark country revolu-
tionists 

  that confounded us i knew it
of course but that this girl should
know it was startling-though rea-
sonable enough for she had heard
it from her father

  well im a motor-oiler wilson
swore you tell us that so openly
youre not very discrete young
lady its lucky no eavesdropping
ray-

  suddenly he was staring at the
little detector in his palm his jaw
dropping wilson wasnt to blame
any more than myself-the beauty
of this girl had distracted us both
the needle of the detector stirred
eavesdropping vibrations were upon
us-someone was electrically listen-
ing to our murmured words

  in that shocked instant we all
three sprang to our feet wilson
had his little heat-gun in his hand

  someone forward he mur-
mured the needle of the detector
registered the direction-toward
the triangle of the bow deck where
fifteen feet from us ladder stairs
led downward into one of the hull
corridors the moonlight glared on
the ladder kiosk no one was in
sight there

  i went with a leap and wilson
was after me the blue-lit descend-
ing ladder was empty then sud-
denly in the shadows under the
kiosk i saw a blob it moved wil-
sons banning gun spat its bolt of
electronic heat but i had knocked
up his wrist so that the invisible
stab hissed harmlessly against the
metal kiosk roof with a shower of
tiny red sparks and the smell of
burning paint he was being too
impulsive

  fn that second i had the crouch-
ing culprit by the throat he tried

to toss his eavesdropper away but i
seized it

  whats the idea  demanded
dont you know this is illegal
y-yes mr masters but i didnt
mean any harm

  he was one of  our crew a young
american-born fellow named brftwn
this was his second or third voyage
with interplanetary starways

  then wilson grabbed him you
were listening to us

y-yes sir he was thoroughly
frightened white and chattering he
gasped i didnt mean any harm
oh you didnt you heard what
we said

  yes-no sir you caught me too
quick

  just curious wilson said iron-
ically for no reason

  yes sir

  i took a look out of the kiosk open-
ing on the dim side-desk nona was
standing staring forward at where
wilson and i had vanished from her
sight there had been no alarm the
man in the control room evidently
had thought nothing of our dash for
the hull ladder the forward look-
out gazing through his telescope
had not seen us

  i turned back to wilson and his
prisoner who was gasping stop
please youre hurting me

  you dont want to talk eh wil-
son was twisting his wrist and cuff-
ing him in the face with the banning
gun well there are short-cuts
wilson fumbled at the equipment
belt under his shirt the young deck-
hand stared w-what are you going
to do he chattered

  gonna hang your tongue in the
middle and wag both ends

  browns eyes bulged as he saw
the hypodermic you-you-
your tongue will loosen all
right wilson said grimly hold
him masters just a jab in his arm
the serum went in within a
minute the panting brown sank to
the floor-grid with wilson kneeling
beside him
earth-venus 



  now-youre all right

  yes-im all right you said-
i didnt say anything youre the
one whos got to talk

  me sure everybody talks
only they told me i mustnt i said
i wouldnt an i wont because they
said if i didnt talk id be rich well
put the passengers off on an asteroid
-serena its called its orbit is
sloping out-a flat eliptic i guess
the passengers will starve-

  wait a minute lets get one
thing at a time who told you youd
be rich

 stood for that minute or two
listening to wilsons tense ques-
tions and browns babbling answers
rambling truth but we could piece it
together very easily nearly half our
crew had been bought by the venus
revolutionists a mutiny was im-
pending now-the starlight arrow
was to be seized by felah bartano-
officers and loyal members of the
crew to be killed

  passengers were to be marooned
the arrow taken to the dark coun-
try of venus its cargo of scientific
weapons would be invaluable to the
revolutionists who were soon to at-
tack grebbar half of our crew mem-
bers were plotting this brigandage
now and among the passengers
were nine armed venusians all ca-
pable of handling the arrow under
bartanos leadership

  it was wholesale murder awaiting
only bartanos signal

  i gasped why-good lord wil-
son-we must tell captain davis
too late from the kiosk door-
way i saw nona still standing peer-
ing toward us there was a sudden
tinkle of breaking glass on the deck
near her-a darkness bomb its liq-
uid antichromatic gas sprang into
a diffusing vapor with a puff of inky
darkness enveloping all that seg-
ment of the deck nonas figure
vanished blotted out in the black-
ness but her scream sounded-a
scream of terror suddenly muffled

as though a hand had been clapped
over her mouth

  then hell broke loose all over the
ship

  the details of what happened dur-
ing that terrible half hour on the
doomed starlight arrow can never
be told there is no one to tell them
for myself i recall that i leaped into
the blackness of the light-absorbing
gas toward where i had heard nona
scream but there was no one-
nothing ponderable there save the
solidity of the side bulls eye into
which i bumped with my wild rush
the impact all but knocked the
breath from me so that i stumbled
and fell

  from the blackness erupted a
chaos of sounds running footsteps
panic-stricken voices screams of ter-
ror screams of agony-the hiss of
heat-bolts the sizzling of electronic
hand-rays then above all the near
and distant turmoil the arrotvs
danger siren suddenly was scream-
ing-shrill ascending electrical whine
like that of a giant in anguish

  within a second or two i was
again on my feet wholesale murder
was everywhere i could hear it
in the control room above me there
was fighting a wildly-aimed stab
of banning heat sizzled past me so
close that i could feel its torrid ra-
diance above the din came captain
davis voice from the control room
shouting orders-and defiance at the
mutineers

  back you hyenas down from
there or ill drill you

 and then he was roaring
masters ken masters go below
the engine room the lower con-
trols

  the gas around me was dissipat-
ing a little i could dimly see the
captain on the turret balcony a
weapon in each hand suddenly his
bulky figure slumped forward hung
for a moment over the rail-then
fell and crashed almost at my feet

  go below-the controls the
instinct to obey made me whirl i
	wonder story annual

was unarmed in the dead captains
hand was a banning gun i seized
it half a dozen men dashed by me
in the gloom friends or enemies i
could not tell i did not fire

  it was futile to look for nona in
all this turmoil for a second i
thought i saw her-but it was mac
the ships surgeon he seized me
ken-good lord

  ordered below i gasped come
on

  we leaped for the little kiosk but
a heat-stab drilled mac and he
plunged to the deck i bent over him

  im-finished the blood of a
drilled aorta gushed through the
burned hole in his chest and he was
gone

  at the kiosk a man plunged into
me-and friend or enemy i drilled
him and leaped over his body brown
was there still babbling

  i plunged down the stairs looking
for wilson overhead i heard some-
one slam the iron door of the kiosk
the main hull corridor was like a
catwalk-a narrow suspended metal
grid with lowt rails doors opened
into the side cubby compartments

  i stood for a moment peering
into the blue-lit gloom the stirring
air currents were fresh of normal
pressure i could hear the swish of
the circulating fluids in the double
shell of the hull-the erentz pres-
sure-equalizers absorbing our inner
air pressure without which the
alumite hull would have exploded to
send our air puffing out into the
vacuum of space

  all the vessels machinery was still
working silence down here with
only the dim muffled sounds of the
overhead turmoil floating vaguely
down

no one here i passed a body ly-
ing on the catwalk-a stewards
his throat was slashed then as i
ran toward the big central control
room i heard a soft call masters

 it was wilson-panting di-
sheveled banning gun still in his

hand masters he gripped me
what became of nona guelph
that darkness bomb-

  i dont know i couldnt find her
captain ordered us down here

  i thought i saw someone drag-
ging her into the kiosk i came down
nobody here-alive i was wrong
she must be still on the deck

  ive got to get to the lower con-
trol room i gasped i was or-
dered-

  i ran with him after me the
catwalk terminated at the control
room door it was ajar

  i was here wilson panted
nothing just-

  we burst in on a blue-lit interior
twenty feet square hydraulic pres-
sure tanks levers for emergency
operation of the gravity plates dials
levers and switches were ranged in
banks around the walls our chief
engineer and his assistant should
have been in charge here they lay
sprawled on the grid floor uncon-
scious

  no sign of her here wilson said
whats aft  i dont know the layout
of this damned place youll have to
show-

  in all the turmoil wilsons mind
was only on the girl he was hired
to protect he whirled from me as
an audiphone here on the wall buzzed
its shrill signal

  ill take it i said i seized it
hello ken masters-lower con-
trols

  it was spellman the radio man
calling from his tiny cubby amid-
ships on the roof he could see all
the upper section of the vessel from
there the brigands were in full con-
trol he gasped when i told him
that only wilson and i were alive
down here

  theyve closed every hatch
masters youre trapped down there
theyve got the decks-herded all
the turret control room-passengers
aft-whats left of them
spellman-you send a call for
help ill shift the plates head us
earth-venus 



back to earth

 cant send a call-radios
smashed through the audiphone
i heard a whizz as though a heat-
bolt had sizzled up there in the radio
cubby and spellman gasped al-
most got me im the only one left
fighting theyll-

  his voice faded i heard his shout
i called into the instrument
dont fight surrender-no use in
getting killed

  but he did not hear me at my
side wilson stood tense theyve
got the ship

  yes-only us

  suddenly there was a blob moving
in the blue-lit dimness of the mech-
anism room-a crouching man at
the doorway wilsons gun and mine
spat their heat-bolts-but too late
the man in the doorway flashed a
tiny bolt of radiac-electrons wilson
fell-electrocuted his clothes and
his flesh blackened emitting a ghast-
ly smoking stench the impact
knocked me sideways and my ban-
ning gun clattered away

  then i leaped-and the crouching
man rose to hurl his empty weapon
it missed me

  we locked together fell on the
grid-floor rolling it was one of the
new crew members-a small grey-
skinned venusian he was no match
for me i caught his thin throat
and choked him until he went limp
then i bashed his head against one
of the steel vacuum tanks until his
skull cracked with a wave of nausea
i flung away the body

  in the sudden silence i stood
panting-alone in the bloody
shambles of the mechanism room
the audiphone to the radio cubby
still was open i called spellman
spellman

  i could hear vague sounds up
there then spellman came on
masters

  yes im here

  finished me drilled-

 what about nona-where is
she

  in the turret control room that
bartano-hes got her in the turret
im finished masters- his gasping
voice faded i heard the thump of
his falling body then silence

  i stood panting wrhat could i do
yield to these brigands-or set the
gravity plates into combinations
which would swing us back toward
earth of what use bartanos
men would come down here after me
perhaps i could hold out for a time-
kill a few of them

  or should i rush up to the deck
the hatches were barred but sup-
pose i could find one open  all futile
-id be killed the moment i reached
the deck

then from down the catwalk i
heard voices-venusians of the
brigand crew-half a dozen of them
-coming down to take possession of
the mechanism room of what use
to try and fight them

  i ran aft through the mechanism
room from the aft catwalk a metal
ladder led downward to the base of
the hull there was a pressure-porte
exit down there a little cubby with
emergency apparatus

  what i might do flashed to me
it was a wild desperate plan but i
could think of nothing else i heard
the tramp and the voices of the
brigands in the mechanism room-
the buzz of the audiphone as bartano
called down to them from the control
turret like a cat i went down the
little ladder

  the pressure-porte wras in the keel
-a ten-foot cubical room with an
upper sliding trap door i dropped
into it and slid the door closed over
my head emergency pressure suits
were here in racks on the wall i
seized one of the largest and donned
it strapped the chemical air-re-
newers around my waist clamped on
the helmet

  the suits were racked into small
bundles i took a second one under
my arm-and in my gloved hand i
held a cylinder of the emergency-
	wonder story annual

repulsion ray

  the pressure-porte here had a
sliding outer trap in the hull base
 did not stop to exhaust the air in
the little room i merely slid the
trap open an inch or two the air
went out with a whining hiss then
i slid the trap wide

  an amazing void lay at my feet
the black firmament of space filled
with blazing points of light stern-
ward i could just see a limb of earth
-a gigantic crescent segment
stretching yellow-red across half the
firmament

   for an instant i paused-and then
i leaped a weird sensation-it was
like thrusting myself into water
the force of my leap sent me down-
ward perhaps ten feet in a sluggish
slackening fall with my body slowly
turning then the gravity of the
bulk of the starlight arrow drew me
back i struck the hull and clung
there with a tenuous hold as though
i were a wafted feather

  inch by inch i crawled up the
hull-side up there was neither
up nor down the hull was a convex
surface under me-the black firma-
ment and the stars were everywhere
else i came like a crawling fly to the
glassite dome

  the dome was translucent
transparent only at the bullseyes
and i kept away from them the
deck tilted sideward was a blur be-
neath me then i was on the dome-
top the control turret merged with
the dome there was a tiny pres-
sure-porte cubby big enough for one
or two people at a time

   i reached the outer slide without
raising the alarm through the tiny
bullseyes i could see the cubical
space under me now the inner trap
was closed i opened the outer one
the cubby air came out then i
dropped down and closed the slide
over me

   the turret was directly under me
now-a ten-foot windowed circular
room the trap beside which i was
crouching was in its ceiling leaving

a drop of fifteen feet down to the
floor there was no bullseye in this
trap i could see nothing but a blur
through the translucent glassite

   very cautiously i slid it the merest
fraction of an inch the turret air
came hissing out to fill my tiny
cubby would the hiss or the up-
ward air current be noticed i
crouched tense unarmed save for
the steel hook welded into my glove

  still no alarm in a moment my
cubby was filled with air i doffed
the helmet shut off the suit mecha-
nisms at once i heard a voice from
below-bartanos voice gloating

  you look so frightened little
earth-bird he said suavely

  those passengers nona cried
are you going to keep on killing
them 

  oh no i killed no one except
when it was necessary they will be
marooned-but not you little nona
you are too valuable to me-a hos-
tage so that your government will
recognize our dark country we
need earths help

   i slid the panel open a little wider
i could see the huge bartano now
standing at the main control
switches and nona across the room
backed against the wall her eyes
blazing her face pallid her golden
hair a disheveled mass on her shoul-
ders

  then abruptly bartano moved
toward her your beauty fasci-
nates me little nona i am master
here master of everything-even
you

  his huge arms went around her
she struggled screamed-but his
hand clapped over her mouth in
that second i dropped

what followed was a blur of
chaotic horror it may be that
in the terror of his death the mur-
derous bartano had only the wild
thought of taking everyone else into
oblivion with him or it may have
been an accident

  for myself i only know that as i
earth-venus 



dropped i saw bartano cast nona
away and lunge at me i swung my
arm the pointed steel hook of my
glove struck his neck sank deep as i
twisted and wrenched then it came
free bringing with it the flesh and
the arteries of his throat-and a
torrent of his blood

  he staggered but for an instant
kept his feet i stood staring numbed
by the grisly sight of him and in
that instant he lurched half fell
upon the main control table delug-
ing it with his blood his arm in a
wild flailing sweep scattering the
fragile glass controls

  there was a flash-a hiss of short-
circuited current then with the
flashing speed of electricity an ex-
plosion down on the deck where now
the brigands were shouting in horri-
fied amazement

another second and an explo-
sion dim and muffled came from
the hull the doomed little starlight
arroiv burst outward

   saw through the turret window
that the dome over the bow-peak of
the deck was buckling cracking
arift with outward rushing air
brief seconds of chaos-men scream-
ing-the hiss and surge of escap-
ing air mingled with their screams

  bartanos body lay in a welter of
gore on the wrecked controls with
the blue aura of free electrons
streaming from it

 i seized nona hurry this
ladder-

  i got the girl up it the air was
thinning we gasped choking amid
the electrical fumes and the stench

of bartanos burning body

  hurry-hold your breath nona
these fumes-

   suppose within less than a
minute i had her garbed and hel-
meted i saw in those last seconds
the whole bow-peak of the dome ex-
plode outward with a litter of human
bodies and wreckage hurtled into
space

   flung open the cubby slide the
aii- blew us out-two bloated figures
clinging together gravity wrould
have brought us back but i flung
the stream of repulsive electrons
from my hand-cylinder turned them
upon the wrecked vessel so that we
were shoved away from it-slowly
at first and then with accelerating
speed

  we clung together bloated hel-
meted figures almost weightless in
the void the great crescent limb
of earth seemed below us the
wreck of the starlight arrow was
above our heads half a mile or more
and rapidly receding

  ghastly derelict of space-it lay
broken slowly turning and around
it myriad little satellites slowly re-
volved-fragments of wreckage and
human bodies then presently the
derelict was only a tiny gleaming
speck of stardust then it was gone

  earths gravity was pulling us
now soon we would be falling like
meteors but in the stratosphere the
repulsion electrons of my hand cyl-
inder checked us so that at last
through the atmosphere we were
wafted gently down

stew and sail on fair friend sail on
i still say that was a ruined city we
saw as we landed

  i think it was myself but i re-
member the way you did that kan-
garoo leap on your neck the first time
you stepped out on the moon you
certainly saw stars

  were professionals at walking
under cockeyed gravities now moon
-venus-

  yes but im still not risking my
neck on the attitude of a strange
planet and a strange race at the same
time well investigate the planet a
bit first and yonder mudhole is the
first stop come on

  they reached the top of one of the
long rolling sand dunes and the coun-
try was spread out below them it
looked exactly as it had been from
the last dune that they had struggled
up it was unendingly red-like an
iron planet badly neglected and
rusted

the mudhole was directly beneath
them an expanse of red and
brown slime dotted here and there
with clumps of dark red foliage

  the stuff looks like japanese
maple said blake

  evidently doesnt use chlorophyll
to get the suns energy lets col-
lect a few samples you have your
violet-gun and i have mine i guess
its safe to split theres a large
group of things down on the left
that look a little different ill take
them while you go straight ahead

  gather any flowers fruits ber-
ries or seeds you see few leaves-
oh you know-what we got on
venus general funk if you find a
small plant put on your gloves and
yank it out if you see a big one
steer clear venus had some peculiar-
ly unpleasant specimens

  blake groaned youre telling
me im the bright boy that fell for
that pretty fruit and climbed right
up between the stems of a scissor
tree uhuh-i shoot em down go
ahead and good luck

  penton swung off to the left while
blake slogged ahead to a group of
weird - looking plants they were
dome-shaped things three feet high
with a dozen long drooping sword-
shaped leaves

  cautiously blake tossed a bit of
stone into the center of one it gave
off a mournful drumming boom but
the leaves didnt budge he tried a
rope on one leaf but the leaf neither
stabbed grabbed nor jerked away-
as he had half expected after his
lesson with the ferocious plants of
venus blake pulled a leaf off then
a few more the plant acted quite
plantlike which surprised him pleas-
antly

  the whole region seemed seeded
with a number of the things nearly
all about the same size a few
sprinkled here and there were in
various stages of development from
a few protruding sword-leaves to
little three-inch domes on up to the
fullgrown plants carefully avoiding
the larger ones rod plucked two
small ones and thrust them into his
specimen bag then he stood off and
looked at one of the domes that
squatted so dejectedly in the thick
gummy mud

  i suppose you have some reason
for being like that but a good solid
tree would put you all in the shade
and collect all the sunlight going-
which is little enough he looked
at them for some seconds picturing
a stout japanese maple in this out-
landish red brown gum

  he shrugged and wandered on
seeking some other type of plant
there were few apparently this
particular species throttled out other
varieties very thoroughly he wasnt
very anxious anyway-he wtas much
more interested in the ruined city
they had seen from the ship ted
penton was cautious

  eventually blake followed his
winding footsteps back toward the
ship about where his trail showed
he had gathered his first samples
he stopped there was a japanese
the brain-stealers of mars	

maple there it stood some fifteen
feet tall and the bark was beautifully
regular in appearance the leaves
were nearly a quarter of an inch
thick and arranged with a peculiar
regularity as were the branches but
it was very definitely a japanese
maple

  rod blakes jaw put a severe
strain on the hinges thereof it
dropped some three inches and blake
stared he stared with steady blank
gaze at that perfectly impossible
japanese maple he gawked dumb-
ly then his jaw snapped shut
abruptly and he cursed

  the leaves were stirring gently
and they were not a quarter of an
inch thick they were paper thin
and delicately veined furthermore
the tree was visibly taller and three
new branches had started to sprout
irregularly now they sprouted as
he watched growing not as twigs
but as fully formed branches extend-
ing themselves gradually as he
stared harder at them they dwindled
rapidly to longer twigs and grew
normally

  rod let out a loud yip and made
tracks rapidly toward the point
where hed last seen ted penton
pentons tracks curved off and rod
steamed down as fast as mars light
gravity permitted to pull up short as
he rounded a corner of another
sword-leaf dome clump ted he
panted come over here theres a
-a-weird thing a-it looks like
a japanese maple but it doesnt be-
cause when you look at it it changes

  rod stopped and started back
beckoning ted ted didnt move

  i dont know what to say he
said quite clearly panting and
sounding excited though it was a
quite unexciting remark except for
one thing he said it in rod blakes
voice

  rod stiffened then he backed
away hurriedly stumbled over his
feet and sat down heavily in the
sand for the love of-ted-ted
wh-what did you s-s-say

  i dont know wh-what to s-s-say
rod groaned it started out exact-
ly like his own voice changed rapid-
ly while it spoke and wound up as
a fair imitation of teds oh lord
he groaned im going back to the
ship-in a hurry

  he started away then looked back
over his shoulder ted penton was
moving now swaying on his feet
peculiarly delicately he picked up
his left foot shook it gently like a
man trying to separate himself from
a piece of flypaper rod moved even
more rapidly than he had before

  long but rapidly shrinking roots
dangled from the foot gooey mud
dropped from them as they shrank
into the foot rod turned again with
the violet-gun in his hand it
thrummed to blasting atomic energy
a pencil beam of ravening ultra-
violet fury shot out and a hazy ball
of light surrounded it

  the figure of ted penton smoked
suddenly and a hole the size of a
golf ball drove abruptly through the
center of the head to the accompani-
ment of a harsh whine of steam and
spurts of oily smoke the figure
did not fall it slumped it melted
rapidly like a snowman in a furnace
the fingers ran together the re-
mainder of the face dropped con-
tracted and became horrible

  it was suddenly the face of a man
whose pouched and dulled eyes had
witnessed and enjoyed every evil the
worlds knew with weirdly glowing
eyes that danced and flamed for a
moment in screaming fury of deadly
hate-and dissolved with the last
dissolution of the writhing face

and the arms grew long very
long and much wider rod stood
frozen while the very wide and
rapidly widening arms beat up and
down the thing took off and flapped
awkwardly away and for an instant
the last trace of the hate-filled eyes
glittered again in the sun

  rod blake sat down and laughed
he laughed and laughed again at the
	wonder story annual

very funny sight of the melting face
on the bat-bodied thing that had
flown away with a charred hole in
the middle of its grapefruit - sized
head he laughed even louder when
another ted - penton - thing came
around the corner of the vegetable
clump on the run he aimed at the
center of its head

  fly away he yelled as he
pressed the little button down

  this one was cleverer it ducked
rod-for the love of-rod shut
up it spoke

  rod stopped and considered slow-
ly this one talked with ted pen-
tons voice as it got up again he
aimed more carefully and flashed
again he wanted it to fly away too
it ducked again in another direction
this time and ran in rapidly rod
got up hastily and fled he fell sud-
denly as some fibrous thing lashed
out from behind and wrapped itself
unbreakably about his arms and
body binding him helplessly

  penton looked down at him pant-
ing whats the trouble rod  and
why in blazes were you shooting
your gun at me

  rod heard himself laugh again un-
controllably the sight of teds wor-
ried face reminded him of the flying
thing with the melted face-like an
overheated wax figure penton
reached out a deliberate hand and
cracked him over the face hard in
a moment rod steadied and penton
removed the noose from his arms
and body blake sighed with relief

  thank god its you ted he
said listen i saw you-you-not
thirty seconds ago you stood over
there and i spoke to you you an-
swered in my voice i started away
and your feet came up out of the
ground with roots on them like a
plants i shot you through the fore-
head and you melted down like a
wax doll to a bat-thing that sprouted
wings and flew away

  uhh- said penton soothingly
funny at that why were you
looking for me

  because theres a japanese maple
where i wras that grew while my
back was turned and changed its
leaves wdiile i looked at it

  oh lord said penton unhap-
pily looking at rod then more
soothingly i think wed better look
at it

  rod led the way back on his
tracks when the maple should have
been in sight it wasnt at all when
they reached the spot where rods
tracks showred it should have been
it wasnt there there was only a
somewhat wilted sword-bush rod
stared blankly at it then went over
and felt it cautiously it remained
placidly squatted a slightly be-
draggled lump of vegetation

  thats where it was said blake
dully but it isnt there any more
i know it was there

  it must have been an-er-mi-
rage decided penton lets get
back to the ship weve had enough
walking practise

  rod followed him shaking his
head he was so wrrapped up in his
thoughts that he nearly fell over
penton when ted stopped with a
soft unhappy gurgling noise ted
turned around and looked at rod
carefully then he looked ahead
again

  which he asked at length is
you 

  rod looked ahead of penton over
his shoulder another rod was also
standing in front of penton my
god said rod its me this time
i am of course said the one in
front it said it in rod blakes
voice

  ted looked at it and finally shut
his eyes i dont believe it not at
all wo bist du gewesen mein
freund 

  was sagst du said the one in
front but why the deutsch
ted penton sat down slowly and
thoughtfully rod blake stared at
rod blake blankly slightly indig-
nant

  let me think said penton un-
the brain-stealers of mars	

happily there must be some way
to tell rod goes away from me and
then i come around the corner and
find him laughing insanely he takes
a shot at me it looks and talks
like rod-but he says crazy things

  then i go for a walk with him-
or it-and meet another one that
at least seems less insane than the
first one well well-i know ger-
man of course and so does rod evi-
dently this thing can read minds
must be like a chameleon only more
so

  what do you mean  asked rod
blake it doesnt particularly matter
which one

  a chameleon can assume any
color it wants to at will- lots of
animals have learned to imitate
other animals for safety but it takes
them generations to do it this
thing apparently can assume any
shape or color at will a minute
ago it decided the best form for the
locality was a sword-bush some
of these things must be real plants
then

  rod thought of a maple tree
thought of the advantages of a maple
tree so it decided to try that having
read his mind that was why it
was wilted-looking-this isnt the
right kind of country for maple
trees it lost water too fast so it
went back to the sword-bush

  now this one has decided to try
being rod blake clothes and all
but i havent the foggiest notion
which one is rod blake it wont
do a bit of good to try him on lan-
guages we know because he can read
our minds i know there must be
some way there must-there must
-oh yes its simple rod just
burn me a hole in that thing with
your violet-gun

  rod reached for his gun at once
with a sigh of relief and triggered
quickly the phoney rod melted
hastily about half of it got down
into the boiling mud before rod
incinerated the rest with the intense
ultra-violet flare of the nistol

  rod sighed thank the lord it
was me  wasnt sure for awhile
myself

  ted shook himself put his head
in his hands and rocked slowly by
the nine gods of the nine planets
what a world rod for the love of
heaven stay with me hereafter-
permanently and whatever you do
dont lose that pistol they cant
grow a real violet-gun but if they
pick one up heaven help us lets
get back to the ship and away from
this damned place i thought you
were mad my error its just the
whole bloody planet thats mad

  i was-for awhile lets move
they moved they moved hastily
back across the sand dunes to the
ship

theyre centaurs gasped
blake will you look at that
one over there-a nice little calico
theres a beautiful little strawberry
roan what people wonder why
the city is so dilapidated if the people
are still here in some numbers set
er down will you ted  they
havent anything dangerous or
theyd have a better city

 uhmmmm-i suppose thats
right but id hate to have one of
those fellows nudge me they must
weigh something noticeable even
here-about twelve hundred pounds
back on earth im setting down in
that square you keep your hand
on that ten-inch ion-gun while i
step out

  the ship settled with a soft
thuvipf in the deep sandy dust of
the ruined city square half a hun-
dred of the centaurs were trotting
leisurely up with a grizzled old mar-
tian in the lead his mane sparse and
coarse ted penton stepped out of
the lock

  pholshth the martian said
after a moments inspection he ex-
tended his hands out horizontally
from his shoulders palms upward
and empty

  friends said ted extending his

arms in a similar gesture i am
penton

  fasthun loshthu explained the
centaur indicating himself pen-
shun

  he sounds like an ex-soldier
came blakes voice softly pen-
sion is he okay

  i think so you can leave that
post anyway shut off the main
atomics start auxiliary b and close
the rooms lock the controls with
the combination and come on out
bring your ion-gun as well as your
ultra-violet lock the doors
blazes i want to come out this
afternoon oh well   blake
went to work hurriedly and efficient-
ly it was some thirty seconds be-
fore he was through in the power
room he stepped eagerly into the
lock

  he stopped dead penton was on
his back moving feebly the old cen-
taur bent over him with his long
powerful fingers fixed around the
mans throat pentons head was
shaking slowly back and forth on
the end of his neck in a loose rather-
detached way

  blake roared and charged out of
the lock his two powerful pistols
hastily restored to his holsters he
charged out-and sailed neatly over
the centaurs back underestimating
mars feeble grip in an instant he
was on his feet again and returning
toward his friend when a skillful
left forefoot caught his legs and
sent him tumbling the heavy bulk
of an agile young centaur landed on
his back

  blake turned-his was a smaller
lighter body far more powerfully
muscled in a moment the earth-
man broke the centaurs grip and
started through the six or seven
others that surrounded him a
grunted word of command dissolved
the melee and blake stood up leap-
ing toward penton

  penton sat on the ground rock-
ing slowly back and forth his head
between his hands oh lord they

all do it here

  ted-are you all right

  do i sound it penton asked
unhappily that old bird just
opened up my skull and poured a
new set of brains in hypnotic
teaching-a complete university
education in thirty seconds-all
done with hypnotism and no mirrors
used they have the finest educa-
tion system heaven preserve us
from it

  shthuntho ishthu thiu lomal
asked the old martian pleasantly

  ishthu psoth lonthul timid
groaned penton the worst of it
is it works i know his language as
well as i know english suddenly
he managed a slight grin he
pointed to blake and said blake
omo phusthu ptsoth

  the old centaurs lined sparsely-
bearded face smiled like a pleased
childs blake looked at him un-
easily

  i dont like that fellows expre-
he stopped hypnotized he walked
toward the old martian with blank
eyes and the grace of an animated
tailors dummy he lay down and
the old martians long supple fingers
circled his neck gently they mas-
saged the back of his spine up to
the base of his skull

  penton smiled sourly from where
he sat oh you dont like his face
eh  wait and see how you like his
system

the centaur straightened slowly
blake sat up his head continued
to nod and weave in a detached way
until he reached up gingerly felt
around for it and took it firmly in
his hands he rested his elbows on
his knees

  we didnt both have to know his
blasted language he managed bit-
terly at last languages always
did give me headaches anyway
penton watched him unsympa-
thetically i hate repeating things
and youll find it useful anyway
the brain-stealers of mars



  you are from the third planet
the martian stated politely

  penton looked at him in surprise
then rose to his feet gingerly

  get up slowly blake i advise
you for your own good then to
the martian why yes but you
knew how

  my great-great grandfather told
me of his trip to the third planet
before he died he was one of those
that returned

  returned you martians have
been to earth gasped blake

  i guessed that said penton
softly theyre evidently the cen-
taurs of legend and i think they
didnt go alone from this planet
our people tried to establish a
colony there many many years ago
it didnt succeed they died of lung
diseases faster than they could cross
space the main reason they went in
the first place wtas to get away from
the thushol

  but the thushol simply imitated
local earth-animals and thrived so
the people came back we built many
ships hoping that since we couldnt
go the thushol would but they didnt
like earth he shook his head sor-
rowfully

  the thushol so thats what you
callem blake sighed they must
be a pest

  they were then they arent
much any more

  oh they dont bother you any-
more asked penton

  no said the old centaur apa-
thetically were so used to them
how do you tell them from the
thing theyre imitating penton
asked grimly thats what  need
to know

  it used to bother us because we
couldnt loshthu sighed but it
doesnt anymore

  i know-but how do you tell
them apart do you do it by mind

reading

  oh no we dont try to tell
them apart that way they dont
bother us any more

 penton looked at loshthu
 thoughtfully for some time
 blake rose gingerly and joined pen-
 ton in his rapt contemplation of the
 grizzled martian uhmmmm said
 penton at last i suppose that is
 one way of looking at it i should
 think it would make business rather
 difficult though also social rela-
 tions not knowing whether it was
 your wife or just a real good imi-
 tation

   i know we found it so for many
 years loshthu agreed that was
 why our people wanted to move to
 - earth but later they found that
 three of the ship commanders were
 thushol so the people came back to
 mars where they could live at least
 as easily as the thushol

   penton mentally digested this for
 some moments while the half hun-
 dred centaurs about stood patiently

   we have myths on earth of cen-
 taurs-p e o p  e like you-and of
 magic creatures who seemed one
 thing but when captured became
 snakes or tigers or other unpleasant
 beasts if held long enough they
 reverted to human shape and would
 then grant a wish yes the thushol
 are intelligent-they could have
 granted a simple earth barbarians
 wish

   loshthu shook his head slowly
 they are not intelligent i believe
 maybe they are but they have
 perfect memories for detail they
 would imitate one of our number
 attend our schools and so learn all
 we knew they never invented any-
 thing for themselves

   what brought about the tremen-
 dous decline in your civilization
 the thushol

   the centaur nodded we forgot
 how to make space-ships and great
 cities we hoped that would dis-
 courage the thushol so they would
 leave us but they forgot too so it
 didnt help

   good lord blake sighed how
 in the name of the nine planets do
 you live with a bunch like that


wonder story annual

  loshthu looked at blake slowly
ten he said ten planets you
cant see the tenth with any prac-
ticable instrument till you get out
beyond jupiter our people dis-
covered it from pluto

blake stared at him owlishly
but how can you live with this
gang with a civilization like that
-i should think youd have found
some means of destroying them

  we did we destroyed all the
thushol some of the thushol helped
us but we thought that they were
our own people it happened be-
cause a very wise but very foolish
philosopher calculated how many
thushol could live parasitically on
our people naturally the thushol
took his calculations to heart
thirty-one percent of us are thu-
shol

  blake looked around with a swift-
ly unhappy eye you mean-some
of these here are thushol he
asked

  loshthu nodded always they
reproduced very slowly at first in
the form of an animal that was nor-
mally something like us and repro-
duced as did other animals but
then they learned to imitate the
amoebae when they studied in our
laboratories

  now they simply split one big
one will split into several small ones
and each small one will eat one of the
young of our people and take its
place so we never know which is
which it used to worry us losh-
thu shook his head slowly

  blakes hair rose slightly away
from his head and his jaw dropped
away my god he gasped why
didnt you do something

  if we kill one we suspect we
might be wrong which would kill
our own child if we dont and just
believe it our own child anyway it
at least gives us the comfort of be-
lieving it and if the imitation is
so perfect one cant tell the differ-

ence-what is the difference

  blake sat down again quietly
penton he said at length those
three months are up lets get back
to earth-fast

  penton looked at him i wanted
to a long time ago but i just
thought of something else sooner
or later some other man is going to
come here with atomic power and if
he brings one of those thushol back
to earth with him accidentally
thinking its his best friend-well
id rather kill my own child than
live with one of those but id rather
not do either

  they can reproduce as fast as
they can eat and if they eat like an
amoeba-heaven help us if you
maroon one on a desert island it will
turn into a fish and swim home if
you put it in jail it will turn into a
snake and go down the drainpipe
if you dump it in the desert it will
turn into a cactus and get along real
nicely thank you

  good god

  and they wont believe us of
course im sure as blazes not going
to take one back to prove it ill
just have to get some kind of proof
from this loshthu

  i hadnt thought of that what
can we get

  all i can think of is to see what
they can let us have then take all
we can and make a return trip with
reputable and widely believed zool-
ogists and biologists to look into this
thing evolution had produced some
weird freaks but this is a freakier
freak than has ever been conceived
i still dont really believe it
blake said the only thing i am
firmly convinced of is my headache
its real enough and logical
enough logical as hell-and hell on
earth if they ever get there evolu-
tion is always trying to produce an
animal that can survive anywhere
conquer all enemies the fittest of the
surviving fit all life is based on
one thing-protoplasm
the brain-stealers of mars



  basically its the same in every
creature every living thing plant
or animal amoeba or man it is just
modified slightly hooked together
in slightly different ways the
thushol are built of protoplasm-but
infinitely more adaptable proto-
plasm they can do something about
it make it take the form of a bone
cell and be part of a thigh bone or
be a nerve cell in a brain

  from some of that ten-second-
college-course loshthu poured into
us i gather that at first the thushol
were good imitations outside-but
if you cut into one you could see
that the organs werent there now
they have everything they went
through martian medical colleges
of course and know all about what
makes a centaur tick so they make
themselves with the same kind of
tickers oh very nice

  they dont know much about us
maybe with the x-ray fluoroscope
screen we could have recognized
their imitations of us suggested
blake

  by no means if we knew the
right form theyd read it in our
minds and have it adaptive proto-
plasm just think you couldnt kill
one in an african jungle because
when a lion came along it would be
a little lady lion and when an ele-
phant showed up it would be a help-
less baby elephant

  if a snake bit it i suppose the
damned thing would turn into some-
thing immune to snake bites-a tree
or something like that i just wonder
where it keeps the very excellent
brain it evidently has

  well lets find out what loshthu
can offer us by way of proof

tt developed that the martians
-t had once had museums they still
had them because nobody was suf-
ficiently interested to disturb their
age-long quiet martians lived for
centuries and their memories were
long only once or twice in a life-
time did a martian enter a museum

  penton and blake spent hours in
them intensive hours under losh-
thus guidance loshthu had nothing
but time and penton and blake didnt
want to linger they worked rapidly
collecting thin metal sheaves of
documents ancient mechanisms a
thousand other valuable things they
baled them with rope that they had
brought from the ship when they
moved it nearer the museum finally
after hours of labor bleary-eyed
from want of sleep they started
back again to the ship

  they stepped out of the gloomy
dusk of the museum into the sunlit
entranceway immediately from be-
hind a dozen pillars a leaping flash-
ing group of men descended upon
them tore the books the instru-
ments the data sheaves from their
hands they were upset slugged
trampled on and spun around there
were shouts cries and curses

  then there was silence twelve
pentons and thirteen blakes sat
lay or stood about on the stone stair-
way their clothes were torn their
faces and bodies bruised there was
even one black eye and another de-
veloping swiftly but twelve pen-
tons otherwise looked exactly alike
each carrying a bit of data material
thirteen blakes were identical each
carrying a bit of factual mustiness
under his arm or in his hand

  loshthu looked at them and his
lined old face broke into a pleased
smile ah he said there are
more of you perhaps some can
stay with us to talk now

   penton looked up at losthu all the
pentons did penton was quite sure
he was the penton but he couldnt
think of any way to prove it it was
fairly evident that the thushol had
decided to try earth again he be-
gan to wonder just-

  loshthu just why asked one of
the pentons in pentons voice did
the thushol not stay on earth if they
could live there

  penton was quite sure he was the
one to think of that partic-


wonder story annual

  pardon me but wasnt that the
question i was going to ask said
another penton in fury

  i can apparently be spared the
trouble of doing my own talking
you all help so said one of the
numerous pentons angrily

  say how are we going to tell
whos who demanded one of the
blakes abruptly

  that damned mind-thief stole my
question before i had a chance-

 why you - you - you should
talk

  i think said one of the pentons
wrearily you might as well stop
getting peeved blake because theyll
all act peeved when you do pipe
down and ill pipe down and well see
what our good friend loshthu has
to say

  eh sighed loshthu you mean
about the thushol leaving earth
they did not like it earth is a poor
planet and the people were bar-
barians evidently they are not so
now but the thushol do not like
work and they found richer suste-
nance on mars

  i thought so said a penton
theyve decided that earth is
richer than mars now and want a
new host dont draw that pistol
blake unfortunately we had twen-
ty-five ion-guns and twenty-five
violet-guns made up if med had
more we would have more com-
panions

  we were exceedingly unfortunate
in equipping ourselves so well in
the matter of clothing and being so
thoughtful as to plan all of it right
so that we carried a lot of each of
the few kinds however i think we
can improve things a little bit

  i happen to remember that one
ion-gun is out of commission and i
had the coils out of two of the violet-
guns to repair them that makes
three guns out of service we will
each stand up and fire one at a time
at the sand in front there the
line forms on the right

 the line formed now con-

tinued that particular penton we
will each fire beginning with my-
self one at a time first ion then
violet when one of us evidences
lack of a serviceable gun the others
will join in removing him rapidly
but carefully are we ready yes
that penton held up his ion-gun and
pushed the button

  it didnt fire and immediately the
portico stank with his smoke

  thats one said the next pen-
ton he raised his ion-gun and fired
then his violet-gun then he raised
it and fired again at a rapidly dis-
solving blake that makes two
we have one more to eliminate
next

  presently another blake vanished
well well said penton pleasantly
the blake-penton odds are even
any suggestions

  yes said blake tensely ive
been thinking of a patch i put in
one suit that i ripped on venus
another blake vanished under the
mutual fire

  theres one more thing i want to
know why in blazes are those
phonies so blasted willing to kill each
other-and though they know which
is which dont kill us and how did
they enter the ship rod demanded

  they said two pentons at once
another one looked at them bad
timing boys rodney my son we
used a combination lock these
gentlemen are professional mind-
readers does that explain their
possession of the guns

  now since these little gun tests
and others have been made i think
it fairly evident that we are not go-
ing to leave this planet until the
two right men are chosen and only
two go into that ship with us fortu-
nately they cant go without us-be-
cause wrhile they can read minds it
takes more than knowledge to navi-
gate a spaceship at least such knowl-
edge as they can get from us it
takes understanding which memory
will not supply they need us

  we will therefore march duti-
the brain-stealers of mars



fully to the ship and each of us will
replace his guns carefully in the
prepared racks i know that im the
right penton-but you dont so no
movement will be made without the
agreement of all pen tons and
blakes

  blake looked up white-faced if
this wasnt so world-shakingly seri-
ous it would be the damnedest comic
opera that ever happened im afraid
to give up my gun

  if we all give them up i think it
puts us even we have some ad-
vantage in that they dont want to
kill us and if worst comes to worst
we could take them to earth making
damned sure that they didnt get
away on earth we could have
protoplasmic tests made that would
tell the story by the way that sug-
gests something i think we can
make tests here lets repair to the
ship

the blakes sat down and stayed
down ted what in blazes can
we do his voice was almost tear-
ful you cant tell one of these
ghastly things from another you
cant tell one from me we cant-
oh lord said another blake
thats not me thats just another
one of those damned mind-stealers
another one groaned hopelessly
that wasnt me either they all
looked helplessly at the line of pen-
tons i dont even know whos my
friend

  penton nodded all the pentons
nodded like a grotesquely solemn
chorus preparing to recite some
blessing they smiled in superhuman
unity thats all right they said in
perfect harmony well well a new
stunt now we all talk together
that makes things easier

  i think there may be a way to tell
the difference but you must ab-
solutely trust me blake you must
give up your guns putting fafth in
my ability to detect the right one
if im wrong realize that i will
not know we can try such simple

tests as alcohol whiskey to see if it
makes them drunk and pepper to see
if it burns their tongues-

  it wont work said blake
penton all the pentons smiled
gently im half again as fast as
you are blake and no martian-born
imitation of you is going to be faster
maybe these martian imitations of
me are as fast as i am but you
know perfectly well that i could ray
the whole gang of you all ten of you
out of existence before any one of
you could move a finger you know
that dont you rod

  lord yes but ted dont do
that-dont make me give up my
guns why should i give up mine if
you keep yours

  that probably was not you speak-
ing rod but it doesnt matter if
it wasnt what you thought we
could do something about it there-
fore that is what you wanted to say
just as this is what i wanted to say
whether i said it or not

  but anyway the situation is this
-one of us has to have unquestioned
superiority over the other gang
then the one with the whip hand can
develop proof of identity and enforce
his decisions as it is we cant
let me be that one then
snapped one blake

  i didnt mean that sighed an-
other that wasnt me

  yes it was said the first i
spoke without thinking go ahead
but how are you going to make the
others give up their guns im will-
ing you cant make them

  oh yes i can i have my faithful
friends here said penton grimly
his eleven hands waving to his eleven
counterparts they agree with me
this far being quite utterly selfish
but whats your system  before
i put my neck in the noose i have
to know that the noose isnt going
to tighten on it

  if i had a sound system in mind
-im carefully refraining from de-
veloping one-theyd read it weigh
it and wouldnt agree at all you
	wonder story annual

see that pepper and alcohol system
wont work perfectly because they
can read in my mind the proper
reaction and be drunk or have an
inflamed tongue at will being per-
fect actors im going to try just the
same rod if you ever trusted me
trust me now

  all right come on well go to
the ship and any of these things
that doesnt part with its gun is
not me ray it

  blake rose jerkily all ten of him
and went down to the ship

  the pentons followed faithfully
abruptly penton rayed one blake
his shoulder blades had humped
curiously and swiftly wings were
developing that helps said pen-
ton holstering his guns

  the blakes went on white-faced
they put the weapons in the racks
in the lock stoically the martians
had seen the to them inconceivably
swift movements of pentons gun
hands and penton knew that he
himself had done the raying that
time

  but he still didnt know a way to
prove it without causing a general
melee which would bring about their
own deaths that wasnt so im-
portant the trouble was that given
fifty years the rest of the world
would descend on this planet un-
warned then all earth would be
destroyed not with flame and
sword and horrible casualty lists-
but silently and undetectably

  the blakes came out unarmed
they shuffled and moved about un-
easily tensely under the watchful
eyes of eleven pentons armed with
terrifically deadly weapons

  several pentons went into the
ship to come out bearing pepper
saccharine tablets alcohol the medi-
cine chest one of them gathered
them together and looked them over
well try pepper he said rather
unhappily line up

  the blakes lined up hesitantly
im putting my life in your hands
ted said two of them in identical

plaintive tones

  four pentons laughed shortly
i knew it line up first stick out
the tongue

  with unsteady hands he put a bit
of pepper from the shaker on the
fellows tongue the tongue snapped
in instantly the blake clappcd his
hands to his mouth gurgling
waaaar he gasped waar-
achooo-damnt

with hands like flashing light
penton pulled his own and a
neighbors ion-gun in a fiftieth of
a second all but the single gagging
choking coughing blake were stink-
ing smoking swiftly dissolving and
flowing rubbish the other pentons
methodically helped destroy them

  blake stopped gagging in surprise
my god it might not have been the
right one he gasped

  the ten pentons sighed softly
that finally proves it thank
heaven definitely that leaves me
to find and it wont work again
because while you cant read my
mind to find the trick that told me
these brothers of mine have the
very fact that you dont know how
i knew proves that i was right
blake stared at him dumbly i
was the first one-

  exactly go on inside do some-
thing intelligent use your head
see what you can think of to locate
me you have to use your head in
some such way that they dont mind-
read it first though go ahead
blake went slowr-footed the first
thing he did was to close the lock-
door so that he was safely alone
in the ship blake went into the
control room donned an air-suit
complete with helmet and pushed a
control handle over then a second

  presently he heard curious bump-
ings and thumpings and strange
floppings and whimperings he
went back rapidly and rayed a sup-
ply chest and two crates of venusian
specimens that had sprouted legs
and were rapidly growing arms to
the brain-stealers of mars



grasp ray pistols the air in the ship
began to look thick and greenish
it was colder

  contentedly blake watched and
opened all the room doors another
slithering thumping noise attracted
him and with careful violet-gun
work he removed an unnoticed extra
pipe that was crawling from the
crossbrace hangers it broke up in-
to lengths that rolled about un-
pleasantly rod rayed them till the
smallest only the size of golf balls
with curious blue-veined legs stag-
gered about uncertainly finally
even they stopped wriggling

  half an hour rod waited while
the air grew greener and thicker
finally to make sure he started some
other apparatus and watched the
thermometer go down until moisture
grew on the walls and became frost
and no more changes took place
then he went around with an opened
ion-gun with a needle beam and
poked everything visible with it

  the suction fans cleared out the
chlorine-fouled atmosphere in two
minutes and blake sat down wrearily
he flipped over the microphone
switch and spoke into the little disc
ive got my hand on the main ion-
gun control penton i love you like
a brother but i love earth more

  if you can induce your boy
friends to drop their guns in a neat
pile and retire-okay if not and i
mean if not within thirty seconds
this ion-gun is going into action and
there wont be any more pentons
now drop

  grinning broadly with evident
satisfaction ten pentons deposited
twenty heart-cores of ultra-essence
of destruction and moved off way
off said blake grimly they moved

  blake collected twenty guns then
he went back into the ship there
was a fine laboratory at one end
and with grim satisfaction he took
down three cotton-stoppered tubes
being very careful to handle them
with rubber gloves you never did
man a good turn before tetanus

but i hope you spread high wide
and handsome here-

  he dumped them into a beaker of
water and took beaker and glass
down to the lock and out the ten
waited at a distance

  all right penton i happen to
know you took a shot of tetanus anti-
vaccine some while ago and are im-
mune lets see if those blasted
brain-stealers can steal the secret of
something we know how to make
but dont know anything about they
can gain safety by turning into
chickens which are immune but
not by remaining as human crea-
tures thats a concentrated dose
of tetanus go drink it we can wait
ten days if we have to

  the pentons marched boldly up
to the beaker resting beside the ship
one stepped forward to the glass-
and nine kept right on stepping
they stepped into the lee of the ship
where the ion-gun could not reach

  blake helped penton into the ship
with a broad grin am i right
youre right sighed penton
but-you cant get tetanus by
swallowing it and lockjaw doesnt
develop in ten days

  i didnt know for sure blake
grinned they were too busy try-
ing to find out what i was doing to
follow your mind ah-there they
go will you ray them or shall i
asked blake politely

  theres one thing-ahhh-he
straightened as the incredible glare
died in thin air-i want to know
how in blazes did you pick me out
to do what you did requires some
five hundred different sets of muscles
in a beautifully coordinated neuro-
muscular hookup which i didnt be-
lieve those things could imitate with-
out a complete dissection i took
the chance it was you

  five hundred sets of muscles
what the heck did i do

  you sneezed

  rod blake blinked slowly and
slowly his jaw tested again its sup-
ports and their flexibility

  in the highest branch of the
conifer tree in the center of the
aerial village crouched taljuck the
quick near him was the gorilla-
like form of ank strongest man of
the tribe

  anks thick lips moved and gut-
tural chattering sounds were articu-
lated through his heavy protruding
jaws it was not language-it was
rather a series of symbolic sounds
painting simple pictures of the
mind

  you think the great one will
come on this sun-death

  taljuck grunted his jaws were
not quite so bestial as those of the
other hairy folk his forehead was
a little higher his eyes a little
clearer his enormous hairy hands
tightened on the odd contrivance he
had made during the last four days

  who can say sometimes the
great one comes sometimes it does
not but when it does come it is
always at this hour

  anks muddy brutish eyes went
to the queer invention in taljucks
hands

  you are going to try that on the
great one

  yes-if it comes taljuck
looked at the new weapon born of
his brain fierce pride was in his
eyes

tt was a tough curved length of
wood nearly four inches through
from end to end of this was a tiger
tendon scraped as thick as his little
finger a long straight stick with
a sharp stone was tied to one end

  taljuck placed the blunt end of
the stick on the tendon stretched
the heavier stick in a great arc then
relaxed it the bow and arrow had
been born of taljucks brain though
its birth was not to be credited for
thousands of centuries through it
taljucks tribe was to reign supreme
for the lives of ten thousand suc-
ceeding generations

  this cannot kill so great a beast
at once but it can pass through

the throat and later the thing will
die

  you can send that stick through
the great ones throat echoed
ank

  taljuck fingered the pointed stone
at the end of the crude arrow eons
later men were to find that and
think it a peculiarly shaped axe-
head not realizing the enormous
muscles of the men that could use
it as an arrowhead

  it will pierce the throat i know
what it can do

  a scream arose from below it
came from the downy lips of a young
girl-sor the farseeing

  it comes it comes i see the
great ones head

  the tree-people rushed here and
there chattering like great apes
one child fell-its hairy mother
swung monkeylike to the ground
caught up her offspring clambered
to the heights again

  to the heights-that did not pro-
tect against so huge a thing as the
great one

  the sentinels biggest and strong-
est men of the tree-folk grunted ex-
citedly to one another all but tal-
juck-taljuck was silent bracing
himself in the tree-fork with hairy
legs while his great hands flexed and
loosed the bow and arrow first of
mans great inventions

  in the semicircle made by the
white sun sinking over the horizon
a head appeared it was a reptilian
head colossal its gaping jaws stud-
ded with huge teeth a short vast
throat appeared then the rest of the
body

 the body was a mountain of
lizard-flesh and bone carried on two
inconceivably enormous legs with a
great tail to help its blundering bal-
ance it hitched over the ground
crushing young trees making the
steamy earth tremble and as it
neared the tree village it reared
higher so that its incredible head
was above the level of the hairy peo-
ples sanctuary
the invincible midge	

  the great one they called it
long long afterward it was to be
named from its remains tyranno-
saurus rex the most ferocious ani-
mal ever known this was an anach-
ronism perhaps the last of its
kind on earth a freak survivor of
a species supposed to have died out
millions of years before the appear-
ance of the hairy folk

  but the tree-people did not know
that all they knew was that sud-
denly moons ago this enormous
thing had appeared over the skyline
at sunset stalked to their village
and taken five of their number as a
tall man might pluck five green
gourds from a high tree and gulp
them down since then the great
one had come at irregular intervals
and always four to seven of their
number went down that tremendous
maw

  bowing to the great one and wor-
shiping it giving it sacrifices volun-
tarily had not placated it the
tribe was in danger of extinction-
unless taljucks two sticks could
somehow save it

  to the highest branches scuttled
the tree folk there to cling like
furred fruit but the highest
branches were not high enough
the trees mighty of girth were not
lofty a roaring whoosh of air was
expelled from the great ones throat
and its basilisk eyes fastened on sor
the farseeing

scream after scream ripped from
her lips her face just becom-
ing downy with the fine hair of ado-
lescence was the color of a lizards
belly the other tree folk chattered
and moaned taljuck bent the great
bow

  the great ones jaws gaped as it
lumbered toward the tree in which
sor clung paralyzed vine catwalks
were swept away like thread by the
monsters bulk there was a last
shriek a dry clashing of teeth-

  taljuck strike ank grunted
in anguish

 in the hands of taljuck the
quick the big bow quivered at its
full arc but the great one was
yards from his perch he did not
yet dare send the long stick with
the sharp stone on it singing forth
as he had learned to do in the days
before

  the tyrannosaurus as though
drawn by taljucks appalled but
steady eyes turned toward his tree
it lumbered there ank chattered
and shrieked in the tree beside him

  strike taljuck strike

  but still with steady eyes tal-
juck held the arrow taut on the tiger
tendon the great one crashed to
within ten yards

  shrilling his despair ank loosed
his hold and fell plummetlike to
earth risking death by the fall
rather than face the monster longer
he moaned and grunted on the
ground both legs broken so the
bone protruded through the hairy
flesh-which meant a lingering in-
stead of a quick death

  talj uck with a grunt released his
stone-tipped stick

  with a thin shriek the arrow
cleaved the air the sharp stone
hit the leather-armored throat of
the great one and went on through
the arrow driven by a force un-
known to the muscular framework
of man today buried itself almost
to its blunt end in the lizards flesh

  the monster stopped its rush
its short front legs went up and its
claws raked at the thing that stuck
out like a splinter from its stream-
ing neck then with an ear-split-
ting scream of air from its cavern-
ous body it came on-toward tal-
juck

  taljuck clung to his tree-fork as
paralyzed as sor had been the
great one was not at all harmed by
the arrow it seemed dimly its low-
ordered nervous system informed
its tiny brain that it had been hurt
-but its vast strength was unim-
paired

  it got to taljucks tree lunge


wonder story annual

against it reached for the hairy
human midge with gaping jaws
taljuck the quick stared at the gap-
ing maw which was streaming gouts
of red from the transfixing arrow
the great bow dropped from his
nerveless hands

  from other high points the tree-
folk screamed and chattered and
moaned the branch to which tal-
juck had clung was empty it quiv-
ered still with the force of clutching
hands that had been torn from it-
and that was all

  taljuck the quick first inventor
was pulp in the tooth-studded
mouth but what was this

  the great one though only two
bodies had gone into its cavern-
mouth was not crashing after more
it stood motionless beside the tree
in which taljuck had clung its ex-
pressionless eyes looked toward the
west not toward extra victims

  a thundering bubbling air-rush
came from its transfixed throat
blood and hairy fragments that it
could not swallow geysered from its
maw it lurched slowly away from
the aerial village

  for a long moment the hairy peo-
ple watched it go unable to under-
stand then the first timid shout of
deliverance keened out to grow to
a chattering grunting chorus

  the great one was being driven
away taljucks stone-tipped stick
had beaten it

  three days later the tribe feasted
on the mound of flesh that lay off
toward the west ordinarily no
death of a man was remembered for
three days individually in the dim
minds of these folk but they re-
membered taljucks because he had
saved the tribe they feasted in
taljucks name and the men of the
village fashioned long sticks to bend
like his and send stone-tipped lances
into the flesh of other animals

 taljuck the quick was dead-
but the tribe lived on saved by the
jiving fruit of his brain

from their mountain observa-
tories all over the world the as-
tronomers peered up the magnifying
channels of their three-hundred and
three - hundred - and-fifty-inch tele-
scopes

  in the teeming cities around them
activities were stilled men women
and children stood hushed in the
streets and they stared as the as-
tronomers did up into the sky for
every mans fearful eye and every
mans appalled thoughts in the year
 were on the same object

  the moon

  from that heavenly ball hanging
balloonlike now in the cloudless sky
it seemed that the death of the
human race was coming for the
moon was dying-and in its extinc-
tion it promised to upheave earth
so that no tiny human mite-per-
haps no life at all-would be left on
its surface

  the human race had thought it-
self in a position to live a tranquil
and untroubled existence on earth
forever it had outlawed the hor-
rible wars that had decimated civili-
zation several centuries ago it had
solved the food problem producing
sustenance for earths billions with
only a few hours of work a day for
each individual it had prolonged
the span of life to an average of a
hundred and ten years

  man was firmly enthroned he had
thought and for a time this had
been true

  but now this cataclysmic menace
from the heavens threatened the en-
tire human race

  in the mount everest observatory
professor talmadge turned from
the eyepiece of the telescope which
was so powerful that it would have
revealed a man walking on the
moons surface had there been one
there to walk he stared at his as-
sistant tohiki

  its the end he said the moon
is falling toward earth at a rapidly
accelerating rate

  tohiki nodded dark slanting eyes
the invincible midge	

shining with sad intelligence even
if it fell no further he said it
would be the eventual end

  both were silent thinking of the
catastrophes that had begun at once
with the moons inexplicable subsi-
dence back toward the planet from
which it had been torn a million
years ago

  all over the world earthquakes of
unbelievable violence had destroyed
cities drained great lakes created
new ones changing earths map at
the incidental cost of millions of
lives

  all over the world volcanic erup-
tions had burst forth on a terrify-
ing scale active volcanoes had
belched more molten rock in a year
than in all their recorded history

  old volcanoes came alive again
new ones formed in the most un-
likely places one its jagged new
crater ten miles across spouted
through ancient rock in the alle-
ghanies obliterating all human life
as far north as new york and as
far south as washington

  but the worst of the disasters
were the floods-ever-increasing in
height and severity

  with each high tide the water of
the seven seas rolled to new levels
pulled by the increasing drag of the
moon daily tidal waves mounted
their roaring crests loftier than they
had been the day before

no coastal cities of any nation
were in existence any longer a
few twisted metal stubs showed
where tall buildings had been a
few weed-wracked lines of broken
stone indicated streets-when they
could be seen at all under low-tide
depths all human beings save
those millions that had been en-
gulfed by the encroaching sea had
long since fled to the inland moun-
tains  

  and still the moon comes closer
murmured the japanese

  still it comes closer talmadge
nodded and it will continue to

approach it will reach the point
where the ocean tides rage over the
whole face of the earth daily they
will submerge all land even this
great crest

  nothing but marine life will en-
dure in fact even that may perish
for at this point the moon will prob-
ably burst and surround earth with
a belt of a million tiny moons that
will blanket us from the sun so that
our planet freezes

  tohikis intelligent eyes went to
a small drawing hung on the observ-
atory wall that may save us
he said

  talmadge shrugged there is
perhaps one chance in ten that a
choice few of earths people may
survive the coming disasters in the
talmadge retreat if anything can
save us that can

  the astronomer who was that
rare scholar a man of general ac-
complishments in varied fields of
science walked to the drawing and
studied it with proud yet critical
eyes

  read in scale the drawing showed
a cavern ten miles across with a
rounded roof a quarter of a mile
high supported by rows of enor-
mous metal pillars the cavern was
in the base of a mountain indicated
by dotted lines their outline was
that of everest itself showing that
the depicted cavern lay beneath the
feet of the two men

  shall we call the elected few to-
night said tohiki

  talmadge bit his lips his eyes
farseeing and keen narrowed then
he nodded

  yes tonight we know what is
to happen shortly there is no rea-
son for delay and tohiki-only
two thousand people the best of
every walk of life

  i understand said tohiki death
was in his eyes as it was in the eyes
of talmadge but the coming cata-
clysm was too great for anything
but utter desperate calmness par-
ticularly you want engineers who
	wonder story annual

can handle the atom-disrupter

  yes by all means replied tal-
madge

  tohiki left the observation cham-
ber talmadge went over in his
mind for the thousandth time the
one thing that made barely possible
the preservation of human life on
earth

  the talmadge retreat no it
was not that anyone could exca-
vate a great cave at a mountains
base it was another matter to feed
and clothe two thousand people in
it to give them air to breathe over
centuries of time this talmadge
hoped to do with his atom-disrupter

  it was the last great invention of
mankind-one which by its very
simplicity had baffled science for
centuries

  all matter is similar in that it is
made from the same building blocks
one substance is different from an-
other only in that its atoms have
varying numbers of protons and
electrons it had been known for
a long time that if atoms could be
disintegrated to their component
parts and the parts rearranged any
desired element could be produced
from the elemental debris further-
more any substance could be con-
trived synthetically by controlled
molecular arrangement

  starkly ferociously simple this
fact and with stark ferocious
simplicity talmadge had solved the
equation

  he disrupted atoms with heat

  but such heat three million de-
grees centigrade produced for a
few millionths of a second by elec-
trical discharge through high-ten-
sion vacuum tubes it could not be
kept up longer for fear of burning
out the apparatus but those few
millionths of a second were enough
to strip atoms

the re-addition of electrons to
produce any given element that
had been more difficult but tal-
madge had solved it in experiments

no less sublime for being empirical
he had discovered that different de-
grees of heat produced different ele-
ments had the differences tabu-
lated thus by a variation of a few
hundred thousand degrees he could
take stripped atoms and give you
what you liked from hydrogen to
uranium

  from then on it was a mere mat-
ter of synthesis to produce anything
from air for breathing to food for
eating-out of rock metallic ores or
anything else at hand there were
slight variations between the syn-
thetic and the real products tal-
madges oxygen for example had
an atomic weight of  instead
of  but these differences
had no practical flaws

  thus with the so-called atom-
disrupter talmadge proposed to
keep two thousand human beings
existing for indefinite centuries in a
cave under the base of everest-
until such time as the planet re-
turned to something like normality
after the moons disruption once
more allowing life on its surface

  talmadge sighed he thought his
mighty invention was perfected if
it were the human race had a slight
chance of survival if it were not

  soberly he looked around the ob-
servatory for the last time absently
patted the magnesium rim of the
tremendous telescope reflector plate
then he went out into the sparkling
cold air of everests crest and
stepped onto the slow-speed strip of
the endless escalator which in its
high-speed outer edge took him to-
ward the mountains base at forty
miles per hour

  within ten hours all were assem-
bled in the great cavern in the
bowels of the mountain there
were men and women of the highest
standing in all branches of science
there were men and women picked
because of eugenic factors to main-
tain the physical stamina of the
race there were a few old men
chosen for their extensive learning
the invincible midge	

-but in the main it was a young
crowd talmadge knew well how
necessary for blind race survival
was a sound physique

  the cave in which these people
were to live and their descendants
after them for unimaginable cen-
turies was ready

  in its center rose a domed build-
ing that was the heart of the place
down from that went a shaft half-
way to the core of the earth up
this shaft came earths internal
heat to be transmuted into plentiful
power

  around the shaft-head were the
banks of atom-disrupters where all
necessities of life were to be manu-
factured tinned food enough for
thirty years was in stock only after
consumption of which would the
two thousand have to begin exist-
ing on synthetic food pellets

  the entrance into the cavern was
a mile-long tunnel from outer air at
the base of everest this had been
blocked up against the future
mighty tides by a solid seal of
liquescent rock which hardened into
a substance like gneiss

  through the center of the mile-
long seal however had been left a
one-inch hole down this were
lenses in sequence terminating in a
fish-eye lens that spread vision a
simple peephole arranged because
the atmospheric disturbances caused
by the moons approach made tele-
vision impossible

  talmadge addressed the shivering
throng in the cavern friends-
earth as you know is about to pass
into an epoch more violent than any
it has suffered since it cooled
enough for life to begin during
this violence we and our descend-
ants hope to exist in here through
flood and fire through the moons
bursting and blanketing of earth
through the ensuing glacial period

  mankinds nucleus may struggle
up to a reborn world from this cave
a thousand years from now a mil-
lion-perhaps never but mean-

while we shall keep the spark of the
race alive i hope

  that was all and even that was
superfluous all knew why they
were here and what faced them the
calm of catastrophe beyond mortal
imagination to visualize held them

  talmadge turned to the peephole

it was all very bewildering and
incredible there was no explana-
tion for the suddenness with which
it happened all scientists had
agreed that the mounting tides
would rise gradually a little higher
each day until at last all earth
would be daily deluged and all
scientists were wrong

  talmadge inventor of the atom-
disrupter turned to that peephole
to see for one thunderous instant a
thing which was impossible-but
which was nevertheless occurring

  instead of increasing in height
gradually the moon-dragged tide
had leaped within a few hours to
within a half mile of what should
be its eventual maximum

  he had thought to see a dry vista
from the mountains base-had
thought it would be weeks before
the high plateau would feel its first
ripples from the distant ocean in-
stead talmadge looked through the
rock seal to see something that at
first he thought was a great moun-
tain chain newly formed about a
quarter of a mile from the fish-eye
lens

  then he saw that the mountain
chain was composed of water was
the first really great tidal wave

  a sort of moan left his lips mile
high in spite of the altitude to
which it had already climbed to
reach here the wall of water rushed
toward everest talmadges stunned
eye saw great crests toppling from
its highest ridge to be absorbed by
the wall before they could cascade
downward so great was that walls
speed he saw something like a tiny
slug for an instant near the crest
realized it was a whale
 he saw white specks on the
ground microscopic in comparison
with the tidal wave swallowed in a
half second and realized that the
lofty buildings of the new city of
ebberhow on everests base had
been destroyed as all things pertain-
ing to humanity must have been de-
stroyed along the total waves path

 a wave a mile high coming
with incalculable speed and force
talmadge saw the solid wall rush
seemingly upon his own defenseless
person as it raced for the far lens
then saw nothing at all as the water
struck the mountains base

  friends he cried turning
from the peephole the cataclysm
is upon us the first great wave
has struck

  his voice was lost in the trem-
bling and rumbling of the mountain
as all of mighty everest quivered to
the shock of that tremendous wall
of water but the people heard-
and tohiki with a despairing
scream sprang to talmadges side

  he was not quick enough

  talmadge ordinarily would have
seen his danger as quickly as the
agile-witted tohiki he knew enough
of hydraulics to realize the incom-
pressibility of water but the mag-
nitude of what he had seen stunned
his brain-and tohiki was not quick
enough

  at one instant talmadge stood
with the back of his head next to
the peephole-and at the next tab
madges head had disappeared his
body sank to the floor while over it
from the peephole roared a one-inch
stream of steam and water as
straight and solid as a metal bar

  the lenses pushed before the
water column like glass bullets
crashed to atoms against the oppo-
site cavern wall ten miles way the
water column endured for five hun-
dred yards before it feathered to
nothingness it grew in diameter to
an inch and a half to two inches to
three before the wave outside
passed on and left a glistening

drenched world to rear bared rocks
to the air again

  then the two thousand in tal-
madges retreat their horrible
panic allayed went to the body of
their leader

  talmadges head had been sheared
off almost as though with a knife
as the lenses shrieked from the
peephole the flesh of his throat
at the stub-end was pulped almost
to the consistency of whipped cream
by the high velocity of the projec-
tiles

  a concerted moan came from the
throng in the cave then shoulders
were straightened with grim resolve
and faces were turned resolutely
toward one another

  outside lay a drowned and lifeless
world-one that woul be so bat-
tered and drowned daily for thou-
sands of years inside their leader
talmadge lay dead

  but the protecting seal of his
liquescent rock and the beneficent
products of his atom-disrupter lived
on after him the human race had
a chance at salvation because of the
work of his clear mind

as it was late afternoon talgor
the tall huddled into the pro-
tection of his vacuum-suit and
stared through the transparency of
his oxygen helmet at the familiar
landscape spreading from the vac-
uum-walled tower beneath him

  he looked absently at a world as
round and smooth as a gigantic bil-
liard ball-a world covered by thin
top-soil on which grew patiently
nothing but lichenous moss-a world
lit dimly by a dark-red sun

  time was according to the an-
cient fables when the sun had been
virile and warm and bright men
did not have to walk abroad in
vacuum-suits to keep from freezing
in the everlasting cold many forms
of vegetation and of animal life had
flourished there had been moun-
tains and valleys lakes and rivers
and oceans
  then according to the dim leg-
ends a great satellite whose name
was lost in antiquity had fallen on
earth it had raised tides that
raged for uncounted centuries the
tides had smoothed down mountains
and filled up depressions the satel-
lite had broken up shielding earth
from the sun and water had frozen
into a solid and uniform shell over
the worlds smooth face

  the countless fragments whirling
around earth had gradually been
pounded to dust by meteors finally
had vanished leaving the world
again to bask in the suns rays but
it was a dying sun now with little
left of its original heat

  but before the great change leg-
end had it that a handful of men
and women had hidden from chaos
in the bowels of earth under a lofty
mountain they had literally eaten
rock tearing down the atoms of
whatever material was around them
and remaking them into lifes ne-
cessities the handful had grown to
hundreds of thousands and the small
cave into which they had originally
gone had become a vast under-
ground kingdom

  then they had emerged to the
world as it now was-to find that
they were not the sole form of life
still existing another form had
evolved across the world from their
mountain a form so alien and for-
eign so horrible-

talgor looked guilty around and
then hastily pressed the little
switch which shielded his thoughts
from the masters almost since the
memory of present men there had
been in the transparent oxygen hel-
mets they were forced to wear in
earths thin atmosphere the fa-
miliar transmitter sending thought
vibrations to the headpiece receiv-
ers of the masters

  it was only a year ago that talgor
had devised the sensitizor screen
which shielded his thoughts from
the transmitter now he could keep
his thoughts secret when they dwelt
on them though he was aware that
death would be his lot if they found

no one could guess how many
million years ago that had been
no one could theorize about the
evolutionary course that gradually
followed all that could be said was
that when man came forth from his
underground empire the descend-
ants of these cold-blooded marine
beings similarly emerged

  they were still cold-blooded able
to freeze and thaw out again with-
out harm they still breathed
oxygen from water their trans-
parent helmets contained water in-
stead of air but they walked on
four paddlelike legs clothed their
glistening hairless bodies in vacuum-
suits

  and in their never-blinking lid-
less eyes shone intelligence-much
intelligence

  they were bigger than man in
brain as well as in bulk man had
stagnated underground he had kept
alive the atomic knowledge compiled
by the nameless hero whose inven-
tive genius had saved the remnants
of the race-but had added no new
knowledge

  the cold-blooded water-breathing
creatures had kept expanding in
brain power

  they became the masters with
human beings as their slaves

  talgor smiled bitterly men were
little enough use to the masters
they were far ahead of men in
thinking ca p a c i t y-their hardy
physical points made them better
fitted to survive in earths present
bleakness talgor had often thought
that the masters allowed mankind to
exist only because of mans hands


  marvelous things hands with
them men and women the slaves
could build machines more easily
than could the masters with their
flippers they could more easily
manufacture the water the masters
needed for their breathing-for long
ago all water lying normally on
earths surface had evaporated

  but regardless of their purpose
the masters kept mankind in a
bondage none the less horrible for
the fact that the great majority of
human beings were not versed in the
ancient legends and did not know the
comparative servitude they were in

  but talgor knew he knew that
men had once ruled earth he knew
that men should be superior to these
cold and emotionless beings calling
themselves masters

  and he plotted for the return of
mans day

he stirred in his vacuum-suit
and stared over the towers rim
below he saw several dozen small fig-
ures moving they were friends
secretly appointed to meet him here
he went down the towers core to
the rendezvous

  a score of figures moved to join
him as he emerged at the towers
base they were white-colorless in
a way inconceivable to mankind of a
far earlier day their hair was white
their skins were white their eyes
were white save for pale smudges of
pupils absolutely without color
talgor the tall towered among
them he was nearly four feet in
height almost as big as the average
master

  you have your thought-screens
switched on he said swiftly and
without preamble

  all nodded soberly they were
moving on the edge of death meet-
ing here conspiring against the
masters and all knew it poignantly

  you are ready to risk your lives
to the end that the world be cleared
of the masters that human beings
shall be supreme again

  their white heads inclined a sec-
ond time

  you know to the full the bondage

in which you are held

  i know said one his voice
sounding broken and hoarse through
the diaphragm in his helmet my
woman was taken last year for
thinking against the masters they
took her helmet and vacuum-suit
from her and watched while she
strangled and froze

  i know said another a short
time ago the masters took my first
child i had allowed the third bank
of atom-rearrangers under my care
to slow for a needed repair and they
sought to punish me

   they threw her a little girl into
the rearrangers i saw her disap-
pear before my eyes then they
turned the heat-control to nine hun-
dred thousand degrees and a ragged
blob of codium appeared where my
first child had been

the others somberly added their
tales of horror and oppression
the last concludcd on a desperate
note-one which talgor however
had sensed before

  the masters are about to get rid
of us i believe this man said
time and again one or more of us
have gone mad and revolted some
of the masters have been killed
some of their machinery has been
smashed they have had several
councils in which men are called un-
stable and a possible menace they
are holding one now i believe it will
be their last council

  talgor the tall nodded with des-
perate calm

  i believe you speak the truth i
believe the race of man is lost unless
a weapon i have been working on
for nearly a year can save it
that is inquired the oldest
among the rest

  you shall see

talgor led the way into the en- 
trance through the thick vacuum
walls of the tower it was an or-
dinary supply tower one of the
smaller and more remote of the hun-
dred towers which were the scat-
tered heart of all life-in which were
all the latest and finest of atomic
machines


  they were substantially the same
as the one which had gone with the
handful of human beings into the
cavern far in the dim past when the
earths satellite fell and broke

  the unknown hero of that time
had come close to the ultimate with
his atom-disrupter

  it was possible to make few im-
provements

  power was still obtained by bor-
ings toward earths core-borings
that pierced to the very center now
the nearest available substance was
thrown into the disrupters to
emerge after varied heat treatments
as the various materials of life just
as had been done in the cavern

  talgor the tall led the way to the
boring in this particular tower be-
side the two-foot-thick nozzle of pure
ardrium hardest of all known alloys
was a squat bell of transparent sub-
stance within which could be seen
numberless tubes topped by a circu-
lar grid of some metal none of the
men had ever seen before

  this is the weapon with which i
hope to save mankind said talgor
his eyes sternly proud as he stared
at the bell within this bell heat
from the boring is converted to elec-
trical energy which is in turn trans-
formed back to radiant heat and
stepped up in wave-length almost to
infinity by the tubes

  the radiant heat is capable of
passing through atmosphere and
other transparent substances of ex-
pending its energy on whatever
opaque body stops it-up to a range
of about ten miles there its force
is dissipated diminished by the
square of the distance traveled but
i think that the range will be
sufficient

  the others stared at him awed
frightened hopeful

  but the masters vacuum-suits
objected one at last they may be
capable of insulating their bodies
against even your radiant heat

  talgor smiled bleakly

  their bodies may be shielded to
some extent but not their heads for
they wear transparent helmets just
as we do and my radiant heat will

  you are sure- began one of the
rest timidly

  i am sure of nothing said tal-
gor i have had no time to experi-
ment properly the masters moved
too quickly for that my weapon may
kill them-or it may not that is the
chance we take now you must go
quickly the masters will be here
soon

  the masters here

  yes for the past few minutes i
have had my thought - screen
switched off so that they could read
my mind and learn of the plot
against them here i concealed only
the manner of the weapon itself
within a few moments the master
will be here-all of them save the
very young and the infirm darting
to crush me before i can menar-f
their race

the other men milled around the
tower with frightened cries for
generations fear of the masters had
been inbred in them

  the knowledge that in a body
they were coming here now mad-
dened them with fear

  leave the tower at once tal-
gors calm voice stated prepare
to kill all survivors of the masters
race as soon as i have struck pre-
pare to lead mankind back to free-
dom

  the men streamed all too willingly
toward the entrance but one said
you talgor what happens to
you 

  leave the tower instantly before
it is too late talgor interrupted
with a break in his voice

what would happen to him he
knew only too well what would
be his fate-what must be the fate
of any man within these walls when
his radiant-heat transmitter began
to function

  the others ran from the tower
from the soles of their metal boots
appeared their gravity plates shield-
ing mass from earths gravitational


pull they shot heavenward soared
on stubby wings that slithered from
the arms of their vacuum-suits rose
skyward again when altitude was
lost in distance repeated the process
sky-hopping rapidly off to the east
and from the west-

  the face of talgor the tall paled
under his helmet

  the sky to the west seemed to be
darkening with a great cloud but
there had been no such thing as a
cloud in the sky for a million years
this blackening was caused by the
massed bodies of the masters-each
of them capable of movement was
rushing to talgors tower because
of the fragmentary thought-threat
he had permitted them to receive a
menace to their race this one mad
human midge must be crushed-
then in more leisurely fashion the
rest of the slave race that had lately
grown annoying

 talgor watched from the en-
trance the up-and-down advance of
the masters like waves of a great
black sea rushed toward him they
towered up in a last ascent before
swooping he could see individual
bodies now-monstrous cylindrical
bodies with four stubby limbs-
heads with staring lidless eyes glar-
ing out through water-filled helmets
he leaped to the control of his heat
transmitter his thin white fingers
clutched it

  one touch of that ardrium lever
and if his calculations were correct
the human race was saved it was
as tremendously as sublimely simple
as that

  but he himself-

  the thin air outside the tower
whistled and shrieked with the cleav-
ing of thousands of stubby wings
talgor the tall pulled the control

for weeks along the equatorial
belt where life was concentrated
human beings under the leadership
of the score who had been the last to
talk with talgor destroyed remain-
ing vestiges of the monstrous race
that had enslaved man for thousands
of years

 who had been too distant to get to
 talgors tower with the main body-
 all the masters talgor had not anni-
 hilated then with mankind once
 more enthroned on earth they
 erected a great statue to talgor
 which they placed where the tower
 had once been

   had once been

   there was scant trace of the struc-
 ture now

   when talgor pulled the control
 the vacuum walls had blazed and
 melted allowing the radiant heat to
 smite full against the wheeling
 towering horde of masters the heat
 had charred their heads then ex-
 ploded their helmets as the water
 within was turned to steam only
 blackened fragments strewed the
 burned earth for miles around-all
 that was left of the last grave threat
 against humanitys existence

   talgor

   well there was no tower left no
 trace of its banked machines there
 was nothing left where the tower
 had stood save a distorted trans-
 parent bell within which was fused
 metal

   talgor had given his life when he
 pulled that control

   talgor was dead but the human
